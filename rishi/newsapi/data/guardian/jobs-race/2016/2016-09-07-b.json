  "<p>Last week, Donald Trump spoke directly to a black Republican group in Philadelphia and at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/03/donald-trump-protest-black-detroit-church\">televangelist\u2019s church</a> in Detroit; his smallest crowds of the campaign compared to those where we\u2019ve seen black women and men among others physically attacked. This recent effort was made after failing miserably at what sounded at times like an attempt to become a black spokesperson, chiding and speaking bluntly on issues of concern to black voters in a manner traditionally reserved for ministers, comedians or motivational speakers with credibility and rapport \u2013 and an actual black audience.</p> <p>Just how convincing are these overtures to black voters? Are his attacks concerning the Clintons\u2019 \u201ctough on crime\u201d policies reaching their intended targets? Who indeed is the audience of Trump\u2019s black talk?</p> <p>The 12% support among black voters he once briefly enjoyed, according to a <a href=\"https://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2324\">February 2016 Quinnipiac poll</a>, has been completely squandered during a run of offensive incidents too numerous list in this small column. Over the summer it <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-voters-trump_us_57a4a2a1e4b021fd98784a42\">fell</a> to 1%. So he projects.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton is a bigot!\u201d He now roars.</p> <p>Some of his remarks seemed aimed at the unabashed bigotry to which the Clintons appealed as the cornerstone of their centrist Democrat ideology in the 1990s.</p> <p>Bill Clinton was the most powerful of the law-and-order Democrats, and actually more punishing than the law-and-order Republicans. Many of us at the time called this out, wrote, talked, and rose against it.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to do nothing for African Americans, she\u2019s going to do nothing for the Hispanics. She\u2019s only going to take care of herself, her husband, her consultants, her donors. These are the people she cares about,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>But is Donald Trump really a righteous messenger, given his mob-leading role in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">tumultuous racial politics</a> of 1980s New York City? Given his lack of apology or remorse over the five lives devastated by his one man campaign against \u201ccrazed misfits\u201d in New York in 1989? Given his \u201csouthern strategy\u201d and apparent embrace of the white identity movement, including his new campaign team led by <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/\">Lee Atwater</a> prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Roger Ailes and alt-right tribune Stephen Bannon of Brietbart News?</p> <p>\u201cThe Democrats have taken you for granted!\u201d Trump trumpets.</p> <p>This is everyday talk in any barber shop, parlor or sports bar, about most politicians. It has been for a good part of Donald Trump\u2019s 70 years.</p> <p>Minus her name, what part of the words, \u201cHillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future\u201d, didn\u2019t Malcolm X himself utter a time or two in messages like The Ballot or the Bullet?</p> <p>Regarding Trump, there is a saying about broken clocks being right on time twice a day. But Trump\u2019s not on time in his message to African Americans. He\u2019s simply restating a known known.</p> <p>People also know Trump intends to promote a \u201cnew civil rights agenda\u201d for our times in the same way they trust Clinton plans to follow through on the \u201cnew \u2018New Deal\u2019 for minorities in the United States!\u201d mentioned once so far only in an early Democratic debate.</p> <p>Did anyone else hear that?</p> <p> What these aspirations have in common is that either would be \u201cnew\u201d, coming from them.</p> <p>A politics of limited options leaves Black America (and all of the country) between the rock of Hillary \u201csuper-predator\u201d Clinton and a hard place called Donald Trumps\u2019 America: hostile, white-ruled, chauvinist and unreconstructed. Likely African American voters, from both parties, not just Democrats, are almost unanimous, in critical Ohio and Pennsylvania, in rejecting the message and campaign of Donald Trump. Never has a Republican nominee been so soundly rejected by a key segment of the electorate. His attempt to prosecute the undeniably devastating impact of the Clintons falls on deaf ears because he lacks all credibility.</p>",
  "<p>Outrage from thousands of would-be passengers at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/07/nine-people-charged-black-lives-matter-protest-london-city-airport\" title=\"\">London City airport</a> that nine young activists should delay them for an hour or two by rowing across a dock and occupying a taxiway. But consternation too, at the Daily Mail and even among some of the English liberal middle classes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/07/nine-people-charged-black-lives-matter-protest-london-city-airport\">Nine people charged over Black Lives Matter protest at City airport</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThese people\u201d who had paddled across the docks in Newham, one of the poorest boroughs in London, were supposedly with the group called Black Lives Matter. But \u2013 shock! \u2013 they were all white. And black people, as you know, are not interested in climate change or air pollution anyway. The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3777065/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-MPs-mourn-Mr-Vaz-s-departure.html\" title=\"\">Mail was splenetic</a>, saying claims that air pollution discriminated against minorities were \u201cludicrous\u201d.</p> <p>Well, times have changed. The days when only black people should protest about issues that affect black people \u2013 and when climate and air pollution were separate issues, and people in east London didn\u2019t need to bother about what happens in Africa or the US \u2013 have long gone.</p> <p>It\u2019s time for a catch-up. One of the reasons why the nine paddled over the dock was because City airport, right in the heart of one of the largest cities on Earth, has been allowed to continuously expand. It is a scandal, and would be challenged in nearly every country of the world.</p> <p>Moreover, the number of planes landing at and taking off from the airport has massively grown, the number of passengers has <a href=\"https://www.londoncityairport.com/aboutandcorporate/page/passengerstatistics\" title=\"\">nearly doubled in nine years</a>, and the planes are far bigger now than they were. Flight paths are <a href=\"http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/uk-airports/london-city-airport/london-city-airport-news/\" title=\"\">becoming more concentrated</a> and the result is <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/blog/entry/why-its-time-to-close-london-city-airport\" title=\"\">more noise, more air pollution, more blight and more public anger</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-lie-in-chains-on-london-city-airport-runway-aerial-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xp54\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2695252\"            data-video-name=\"Black Lives Matter protesters lie in chains on London City airport runway \u2013 aerial video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57ce92e0e4b01f3b278919e4\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906aerialsairport_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/06/160906aerialsairport.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160906aerialsairport_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-lie-in-chains-on-london-city-airport-runway-aerial-video\">Black Lives Matter protesters lie in chains on London City airport runway \u2013 aerial video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet City airport\u2019s expansion has been shovelled through local and national planning with minimum consultation and without much public debate, even as air pollution in London is known by the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/15/nearly-9500-people-die-each-year-in-london-because-of-air-pollution-study\" title=\"\">to be killing 9,500 people a year and breaking the law</a>.</p> <p>But there are other reasons why the nine crossed the pond. East London, with some of the most deprived, blighted and polluted communities in Europe, is targeted by the road-building lobby and Transport for London for not just one more Thames four-lane road bridge or tunnel, <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/new-river-crossings-for-london\" title=\"\">but three</a>.</p> <p>If these are built, Newham and Tower Hamlets boroughs, in the north, and Greenwich and Bexley, south of the river, will each get massive new roads and tens of thousands of extra cars ploughing through them every day. Transport for London claims that the new crossings will bring relief from congestion. The reality, say the experts, is that they will bring extra traffic and pollution.</p> <p>Air pollution in Silvertown, where one tunnel is proposed, is already <a href=\"http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/environment/air_pollution_expert_brands_silvertown_tunnel_plans_criminal_and_unjust_1_1831084\" title=\"\">more than one-and-a-half times</a> the European legal limit. In parts of Tower Hamlets, where another crossing is planned, it is worse. According to the government, 98 people in Newham alone died from air pollution in 2010.</p> <p>Residents in these boroughs have long been dumped on by governments. They get the sewage works, the concrete works and the pollution, and now they can expect more heart and lung diseases, more pressure on the National health, more costs and more personal heartache. Unsuprisingly, many are pretty furious.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the climate. As Asad Rehman of Friends of the Earth says, when it comes to climate change, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/31/climate-change-poor-suffer-most-un-report\" title=\"\">those who have done the least to create the climate crisis are the worst affected</a>. Devastating floods, droughts and famine, mainly affecting the lives and livelihoods of millions of poor and black communities in developing countries, is the stark reality of climate change already. This is going to get much worse if rich countries such as the UK don\u2019t do more to cut their emissions faster and deeper, and sign up to the Paris agreement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Average emissions of business people flying from City are probably way more than the average person living in Newham</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the same in London. Average emissions of business people flying from City airport are almost certainly way more than those of the average person living in Newham or Tower Hamlet boroughs.</p> <p>Moreover, there is plenty of evidence that black people and ethnic minorities are much more likely to be affected by bad air. Research first <a href=\"http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf\" title=\"\">by the UK government</a>, and <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_26-1-2015-12-17-52\" title=\"\">recently</a> by Imperial College London and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands have shown that the average person identifying as black or black-British African in the UK is exposed to much higher levels of pollutants than the average urban white person.</p> <p>Children, older people, those with asthma and cyclists are all more likely to be affected by poor air quality, as are poorer communities and minority ethnic ones. The study concluded that the most deprived 10% of areas in England are subject to 41% higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide from transport and industry than the average. The biggest differences in air pollution levels according to socioeconomic status were in London.</p> <p>Agendas and groupings have merged. We know that to reduce climate emissions we need to tackle air pollution as well. It little matters who takes the lead in challenging power or under which banner people choose to act. There is no longer ownership of police atrocities, or pollution or injustice. The only certain things these days in the environment is that racism thrives and that pollution follows the poor.</p>",
  "<p>In the cool and serene area of Karen, near Nairobi, in the offices of the conservation organisation she has built, Paula Kahumbu eats chicken and rice and talks about a revolution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/why-the-guardian-is-spending-a-year-reporting-on-the-plight-of-the-worlds-elephant-population\">Why the Guardian is spending a year reporting on the plight of elephants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cConservation is not a monopoly of one particular race or tribe. Conservation is part of all of us,\u201d says Kahumbu. \u201cYet for decades, looking after the environment in Africa has been seen as a \u2018white man\u2019s job\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The 49-year-old Kenyan is leading a new generation of African conservationists. But she owes her own debt to that anachronistic European network. By chance, she grew up next door to one of the best-known conservationists of all time, <a href=\"http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/lea0bio-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richard Leakey</a>. With time, Leakey\u2019s interest in the wild rubbed off on a young Kahumbu.</p> <p>\u201cRichard Leakey has been my mentor since I left high school. I have known him since I was a child as he was a neighbour who encouraged me to explore and learn all I could about wildlife,\u201d Kahumbu says.</p> <p>After doing courses in Bristol and Florida, Kahumbu became a ranger employed by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). But while in government and with all the state privileges that came with her position, the irony was she could not fully speak up.</p> <p>\u201cAfter a while I realised that there are things I could say and many more that I couldn\u2019t say while employed by the Kenya Wildlife Service. There was a limit to what I could do. Government has too much protocol \u2026 too many checks on your way to doing the right thing.\u201d </p> <p>Within a couple of years, Kahumbu had set up her own organisation with Leakey, <a href=\"http://wildlifedirect.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wildlife Direct</a>, and was campaigning in her own right.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10f1ce10b233dca07a272b38dd6d01b09acf9e7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10f1ce10b233dca07a272b38dd6d01b09acf9e7f/0_0_1650_1093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children read educational comics as part of Kahumbu\u2019s Hands Off Our Elephants campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children read educational comics as part of Kahumbu\u2019s Hands Off Our Elephants campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Whitley Fund for Nature</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the years since that decision, Kahumbu, who has regularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paula-kahumbu\">contributed to the Guardian</a>, has become one of the most successful and high profile conservationists in Africa.

In Uganda, gorilla veterinarian Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka has founded <a href=\"http://www.ctph.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conservation Through Public Health</a>, which supports the health of wildlife and local communities. Zambia\u2019s Thandiwe Mweetwa is a lion expert and a National Geographic awardee. Makala Jasper of Tanzania has fostered the community stewardship of forests and <a href=\"http://nationalgeographic.org/projects/explorers-week/makala-jasper/\" rel=\"nofollow\">helped tens of thousands of people</a> improve their lives and their environment.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many more out there and I know that through their work, Africa\u2019s wildlife stands a chance,\u201d says Kahumbu. For her, encouraging more Africans into conservation means inspiring passion and wonder for the natural world.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to show the children how beautiful our country is. Automatically they will want to protect and conserve our environment,\u201d she says. Each year her organisation takes primary school children into the national parks \u201cso that from an early age they will know what is at stake\u201d. </p> <p>Currently, together with other conservationists, Wildlife Direct produces Kenya\u2019s first wildlife documentary and talk show on local TV station, NTV. The programmes debuted to rave reviews from TV pundits and bloggers. Kahumbu says the two programmes reach an average audience of 4 million viewers every week.</p> <p>\u201cThrough the programmes we hope to engage a much wider audience and tell Kenyans about the beauty within their country. It is only through showing them this that they will appreciate nature and hopefully get into conservation themselves,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Speaking to Africans about conservation is not uncontroversial and her work has not always been straightforward. Wildlife in Kenya, like in many other parts of the world, is under threat from shrinking habitats, poaching and corruption. Because of this, Kahumbu\u2019s life has been threatened more than once. </p> <p>\u201cThe sad thing is that in my line of business, those who threaten you are those you least expect,\u201d she says. Three years ago she was warned of \u201cdire consequences\u201d if she chose to continue with a court case over the hiving off part of the Nairobi national park to build a road that would link two ends of the city and cut through important habitat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc9ba44d2ec14f80f5512b848d2bc67241d23825\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc9ba44d2ec14f80f5512b848d2bc67241d23825/0_276_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paula Kahumbu with school children\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need to show the children how beautiful our country is.

After three years of planning and lobbying, Wildlife Direct \u2013 in partnership with other organisations \u2013 got the Kenyan government to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/29/kenya-to-burn-biggest-ever-stockpile-of-ivory\">burn all its ivory stockpiles</a> in April, with the aim of distorting black market ivory prices.</p> <p>\u201cThat will have a trickledown effect that will lead to the securing of the global elephant population,\u201d she says. \u201cIvory prices are already coming down as a result of that \u2026 and countries have banned the trade of ivory and ivory products within their borders. The direct impact of this will be felt later when jumbo populations around the continent recover.\u201d</p> <p>The path towards this recovery has perhaps never been more controversial. At the meeting of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cites.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) later this month, proposals and counter-proposals aim to either create a blanket global ban on almost any ivory trade or open up controlled sales from some southern African countries. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.iucn.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) will debate a total domestic ban at its conference this week.</p> <p>Kahumbu says elephants deserve the highest level of protection and that the possibility of future trade is a major threat to their survival because it attracts ivory speculators.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been lobbying for domestic bans in ivory trade worldwide for several years. We support it and regret that IUCN and Cites have taken so long to recognise the need for this. It couldn\u2019t come soon enough,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As the debate on a total ban on ivory trade goes on, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are pushing for one-off sales of their stockpiles. \u201cThis is outrageous given the plight of elephants, which was triggered by these same countries selling ivory in 2008 to China and Japan. They too should join the rest of the world sooner rather than later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is shocking that three southern African nations will not acknowledge this.\u201d</p> <p>Kahumbu\u2019s love for elephants has been the consuming passion of her life. She has worked for six straight weeks without a break. But she doesn\u2019t mind.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my life. And you can\u2019t really take a break from life, can you?\u201d she asks. As she finishes off her late lunch, she reflects on the paradox that is conservation.</p> <p>\u201cIt is immensely fulfilling, but can be thankless too. The results of many of the wars we fight and win in conservation are not instant.

Produced by black movie mogul Will Packer and written by David Loughery, who also wrote Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Obsessed sets the template for the genre with a story about a successful black couple (Beyonc\u00e9 and Idris Elba) who are terrorized by insane white lady Ali Larter, who wants nothing more than to have sex with Idris Elba, which is pretty relatable for most viewers, I\u2019d imagine. She\u2019s a temp at the office where Elba\u2019s character works and falls in love with him instantly. That love leads her to drugging and raping him, because it\u2019s that kind of movie and you just have to go with it. The end of the film features Beyonc\u00e9 kicking the crap out of Ali Larter, which is a perfect starter course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with\">before listening to Lemonade</a>.</p> <p>One of the major tenets of the genre that Obsessed establishes is that the husband or boyfriend character is usually a total doofus. Either he allows himself to be seduced or has neglected his lover so much that she has to step outside the boundaries of their relationship to be sexually satisfied.</p> <h2>No Good Deed (2014)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5VeowxERwM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/G5VeowxERwM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Idris Elba\u2019s back, making him the current king of the thot horror film. This time he\u2019s the maniac, terrorizing Taraji P Henson. He\u2019s a convicted felon with a crashed car. She\u2019s a bored housewife titillated by the idea of a strange man in her home. When she foolishly lets him come in from the rain to call a tow truck, he takes her hostage for reasons she won\u2019t understand until the third act twist: Henson\u2019s husband has been cheating with Elba\u2019s former fiancee and when he comes to Henson\u2019s house, it\u2019s for revenge. The moral of the story here is that if you are an upwardly mobile black couple, you either want to cheat on your spouse or you already have. Regardless, you are going to have to pay for your crime, possibly through a gruesome death at the hands of a very attractive person.</p> <h2>Addicted (2014)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LErjzY_wKI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4LErjzY_wKI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Based on the romance novel by Zane (not Billy Zane or Zane Lowe or Zayn Malik \u2013 just Zane), Addicted is another slight variation on the typical tropes of the genre. This time, the sexually obsessed maniac is the protagonist. Sharon Leal plays Zoe, a successful business owner with a husband and two children. She\u2019s got the perfect life ... or does she? You see, she loves sex. In fact, she loves it so much that after two acrobatic romps with her also very successful husband (Boris Kodjoe) in the first scene of the film, she wants to go again, but, as you might expect, he\u2019d prefer to go to sleep. Her insatiable desire leads her to a series of affairs which turn messy when the two secret lovers become aware of each other.</p> <p>While the appeal of this genre is usually based in titillation and sexual wish fulfillment, Addicted subverts that, while also reveling in it. Zoe is a sex addict because she was molested as a child, so as much fun as the viewer might have watching attractive people engaging in softcore sex scenes, Addicted becomes a message movie about a very real problem in the third act. An exploitation film that pivots to actual pain at the end is like eating ice cream and finding the percentage of the global homeless population written on the bottom of the bowl.</p> <h2>The Perfect Guy (2015)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CikoxQ4ytI4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CikoxQ4ytI4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Surprisingly, this is the first appearance of African American cinema\u2019s hardest working actor, the legendary Morris Chestnut. If there\u2019s a movie about black folks, chances are strong that Morris Chestnut will show up: The Best Man, The Inkwell, Boyz in the Hood, Think Like a Man, Not Easily Broken, Like Mike. He\u2019s truly black America\u2019s Josh Duhamel or James Marsden. Sure, he\u2019s not on the level of Idris Elba or Denzel Washington (who would never submit to starring in one of these movies, by the way) but name me one film that isn\u2019t better from going Full Chestnut? That\u2019s right, you can\u2019t. How is it that there are numerous black superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and yet none of them are played by Morris Chestnut? Why is Morris Chestnut not in the Fast and Furious series? Can I get #JusticeForMorrisChestnut trending on Twitter?</p> <p>Anyway, in The Perfect Guy, Chestnut is the ineffectual boyfriend of Sanaa Lathan. He doesn\u2019t want to commit, so she dumps him and shacks up with an edgy guy she meets at work, played by Michael Ealy. He ends up being an insane stalker, she tries to dump him and go back to her ex, but the dude\u2019s a stalker and doesn\u2019t take the hint. Ealy\u2019s character kills Chestnut, and none of this would have happened if he\u2019d just agreed to start a family, a lesson he learns in our next film.</p> <h2>When the Bough Breaks (2016)</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws74Ie4fMc8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ws74Ie4fMc8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Let\u2019s all pretend for a moment that When the Bough Breaks stars Morris Chestnut\u2019s character from The Perfect Guy, reincarnated as pretty such the same dude, but with a chance to do it right this time. The new, improved Morris Chestnut has finally grown up, because now he wants a baby with his wife, Regina Hall. But they physically can\u2019t have a kid, so they have to get a surrogate. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, but the surrogate is a sex-crazed monster played by Jaz Sinclair from the movie Paper Towns. When the Bough Breaks cements the thot horror genre as about on the level with the Lifetime Original Movie, but instead of taking place in an east coast suburb full of white people, it features rich black people in the city. </p> <p>So what does the future hold for the thot horror genre hold? The cast of Empire needs something to do between seasons. I don\u2019t mean Taraji P Henson or Terrence Howard. I mean the kid who plays Hakeem. Why isn\u2019t he in one of these? He\u2019d be great at terrorizing a couple yuppies and threatening to steal their baby. Where is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2014/may/14/shonda-rhimes-scandal-tv-diversity-showrunner-davis\">Shonda Rhimes</a> in all of this? She should be cranking out evil side pieces once or twice a year. It\u2019s time that African Americans get their very own Basic Instinct \u2013 a completely unhinged erotic thriller that breaks through into the mainstream. The Oscars might still be so white, but HBO at 3am should be full of Morris Chestnut rebuking the advances of his nanny until the end of time.</p>",

It was this picture that sprang to mind when I saw the first images of the nine white demonstrators who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/nine-black-lives-matter-protesters-arrested-amid-city-airport-travel-chaos\">arrested at London City Airport yesterday</a>, as part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/06/black-lives-matter-uk-found-vital-social-justice\">Black Lives Matter UK</a> protest. Just like them, Corbyn falls under the banner of being a strong \u201cwhite ally\u201d: someone willing to put their liberty on the line for a cause that doesn\u2019t necessarily directly affect their wellbeing.</p> <p>White allyship, though not often talked about outside of activist circles, is a key part of many anti-racism movements, and is especially crucial in countries like the UK, where people of colour make up only 13% of the population. The BLM UK organisers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ukblm/status/773149708445425664\">have taken to Twitter</a> since the protest to pose the question: \u201cHow many white people does it take to change the subject from black deaths? 9\u201d. The public conversation about white allyship is one that needs to be had. We need to encourage allyship, and, if we are able, educate certain white people so they are able to take responsibility and challenge a system that often sees them at the top of the pile.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/climate-change-racist-crisis-london-city-airport-black-lives-matter\">Climate change is a racist crisis: that\u2019s why Black Lives Matter closed an airport | Alexandra Wanjiku Kelbert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the last BLM UK \u201cshutdown\u201d at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/05/black-lives-matter-protest-sparks-heathrow-traffic-chaos\">Altab Ali park</a> in August, I witnessed how easily discussions within the organisation can become led by the voices of those who haven\u2019t experienced racism and prejudice in the UK \u2013 trust me, it does exist. (As a reminder, there has been a five-fold increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/police-report-fivefold-increase-race-hate-crimes-since-brexit-result\">race-hate complaints</a> recorded since Brexit.) The event, which saw us split up into groups according to where in London we were based, was led by black voices, but also saw a lot of white speakers who sometimes seemed to take up space in a place where they should have been stepping back and listening.</p> <p>Because of this, I understand the grievances aired by some of my friends and fellow journalists who say that it\u2019s far too soon into the movement for such a public protest that\u2019s supposed to be centred around black lives to have been dominated by white people. But ultimately I do believe the decision that BLM UK made to use white allies in this particular protest to be the right choice.</p> <p>This is because the UK, much like America, has a dark history of deaths of black people at the hands of the police. With the stories of black Britons such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/18/mzee-mohammed-death-liverpool-mayor-transparent-inquiry\">Mzee Mohammed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/17/sarah-reeds-mother-deaths-in-custody-holloway-prison-mental-health\">Sarah Reed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\">Mark Duggan</a> (all of whom died following interactions with the police) still fresh on our minds, I imagine BLM UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/climate-change-racist-crisis-london-city-airport-black-lives-matter\">was considering the safety of their protesters</a> when they allowed the nine white runway hijackers to cross the Thames and take their short-lived stand. As the Met chief Bernard Hogan-Howe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/05/met-chief-admits-institutional-racism-claims-have-some-justification\">admitted last year</a>, accusations that the police force is \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d have \u201csome justification\u201d. Perhaps, in this instance, black lives really did matter and they were prioritised.</p> <p>Regardless of whether or not you believe they were the right protestors to have been raising awareness about the 200 million climate refugees we are likely to see by 2050, the 3,176 migrants that have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean this year, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/protest-jamaican-embassy-against-deportation-flight\">chartered flight scheduled to forcibly remove over 50 people back to Jamaica today</a>, their principles seem pure, and in my mind their allyship can only be a positive thing.</p> <h2>Kehinde Andrews: Black people don\u2019t need white people protesting on our behalf</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"363c9c7a9072b31cd90d016bae157aee4383ee8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/363c9c7a9072b31cd90d016bae157aee4383ee8f/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Kehinde Andrews\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Black Lives Matter is in a pivotal moment in defining how it develops into a sustainable movement that goes beyond the politics of protest. The <a href=\"https://policy.m4bl.org/\">Movement for Black Lives</a> has started this work in America, by creating a detailed policy platform. However, in Britain the movement is still in the very early stages and the next few months will be crucial in how it is defined, both at the grassroots black community level and in the public imagination.</p> <p>The power of the movement so far has been giving a voice to black, young and marginalised people who are so often ignored. Moving forward, the movement must be defined and led by those same black voices that it emerged to represent. Now is not the time for high-profile actions by white allies because the movement is at a stage where it is all too easy to be derailed, delegitimised and co-opted by \u201cwhite ally-ship\u201d. This is something that the very people Black Lives Matter are seeking to represent are all too suspicious of.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/protest-jamaican-embassy-against-deportation-flight\">Protest at Jamaican embassy in London against deportation flight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The issue of \u201cwhite allyship\u201d in black-led movements against racial oppression has always been central. Rather than the much overplayed discussion on the use of violence, the role of white allies is one of the most important fault lines between the iconic politics of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. King represents those who have insisted on the need for cross-racial alliances and welcomed white leadership. Malcolm speaks for those who want to create black-led spaces and avoid the co-option of the movement by well-meaning white allies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ac4b00de00259f28624837e7f430fd948f7469b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ac4b00de00259f28624837e7f430fd948f7469b/0_41_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Luther King and Malcolm X represent either side of  the \u2018white allyship\u2019 debate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Luther King and Malcolm X represent either side of the \u2018white allyship\u2019 debate</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marion S Trikosko/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Malcolm\u2019s concerns about white allies, were that they tended to \u201cweaken\u201d the strength of the movement by shifting the focus away from marginalised black voices. A major part of making Black Lives Matter sustainable is creating a coherent narrative. There is certainly a need to broaden out from focusing on deaths at the hands of the state. But as important an issue as climate change is for racial justice, this kind of scattergun approach weakens the message. Every social issue from urban planning to medical research negatively impacts on black life, but if simply becomes a series of protests a random set of issues, then the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d will just become an empty slogan. As Malcolm says, our white allies may \u201cprove they are with us \u2026 without helping solve the problem of racism\u201d.</p> <p>Perception is also vital at this stage for maintaining community support for the movement. Protesting about a favourite issue of the white left at an airport, the day before a scheduled charter flight arbitrarily deporting many Jamaican nationals, will have raised suspicions in the very communities Black Lives Matter emerged from. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/climate-change-racist-crisis-london-city-airport-black-lives-matter\">are assured that </a>the protest was black-led, but the comparison and imagery will stoke fears of the movement being co-opted.</p> <p>Black people do not need white people protesting on our behalf. We need to focus on building a sustainable movement around the young, black and marginalised that Black Lives Matter has awoken.</p>",
  "<p>And now, the end is near. As the world gets twinkly eyed about the Obamas leaving the White House, one fashion truth remains.

The British people have a right to know the answers and the right to have their say on whether the deal on offer is right for them, their family, their community and our country.</p> <p>In the meantime, the government needs an opposition, and Labour has abandoned the field. Under Corbyn the party is hopelessly divided, has no plan for the economy and is clearly unfit for government. The opposition just isn\u2019t doing its job.</p> <p>So if Labour won\u2019t, we will. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/brexit-vote-nigel-farage-making-uk-laughing-stock-abroad-tim-farron\" title=\"\">We will be the real voice of opposition to the Conservative Brexit government</a>. We will hold May to account over Brexit, expose the lies that Boris Johnson and co told during the referendum, and make sure that whatever deal they try to do is as good for the UK\u2019s economy, security and standing in the world as possible.</p> <p>And let me be clear: I don\u2019t believe there is any deal that May can do that will be better for Britain than being a member of the EU. So when people are given that choice, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/liberal-democrats-fight-election-halting-brexit-tim-farron\" title=\"\">we will make the case loudly and clearly that we believe Britain should stay in the European Union</a>.</p> <p>We believed that Britain is better off inside the EU the day before the referendum, we believed it the day after and we believe it today. We may have lost the referendum but that doesn\u2019t change what we believe is right for the UK.</p> <p>People have been let down for decades by short-termist politicians who put the needs of one part of society above the rest. Now, in the wake of the Brexit vote, those divisions are more exposed than ever before. With our country facing huge challenges \u2013 from inequality and injustice to an NHS in crisis and an economy in jeopardy \u2013 we are left with a reckless, divisive and uncaring Conservative government, and Labour MPs fighting among themselves.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the Liberal Democrats are needed more than ever. We are the real voice of opposition and the only party fighting to keep Britain open, tolerant and united.</p>"
