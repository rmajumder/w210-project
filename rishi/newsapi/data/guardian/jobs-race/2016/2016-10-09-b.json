  "<p>Paul Nicholls is back on top of the trainers\u2019 table after a four-timer here on Sunday that must count as an excellent early omen as he sets out to win an 11th championship. This fixture has not been reliably productive for the Somerset man in recent seasons but everything was rolling his way this time and his profit included the winnings from a rare bet, \u00a350 each-way at 12-1 on Art Mauresque, who may now be aimed at next month\u2019s BetVictor Gold Cup at Cheltenham.</p> <p>With the core jumps season looming, this can be a confusing and frustrating time for jumps trainers. \u201cNo matter what you\u2019re thinking, you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s ready and what\u2019s not,\u201d Nicholls said but he was sufficiently confident of Art Mauresque to produce his own money when he saw how little the bookmakers thought of his chance in this handicap chase, his first run since May.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/newmarket-horse-racing-aidan-obrien-churchill-dewhurst-stakes\">Aidan O\u2019Brien enjoys Group One glory as Churchill wins Dewhurst Stakes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI said to Johnny [De La Hey, owner], \u2018I\u2019m missing a trick here, he should not be 12-1\u2019. Because he\u2019s been running really well and he\u2019s a better horse this year. I really fancied him. He travelled like a legend.\u201d</p> <p>Unexpectedly left in front three out when the leader folded quickly, Art Mauresque idled and held on by a mere head from the strong-finishing Double Shuffle. The pair could meet again in the Cheltenham handicap that, for many, marks the real start of each winter\u2019s jump racing, though Nicholls also mentioned Aintree\u2019s Old Roan Chase as a possible target.</p> <p>His four winners here salted away more than \u00a350,000 in prize money and took him almost to \u00a3300,000 for the season, easily enough to carry him past David Pipe and Charlie Longsdon and into a clear lead in the table. Taking into account the recent news of Willie Mullins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/28/willie-mullins-loses-60-gigginstown-stud-horses-training-fees-row\" title=\"\">losing 60 Michael O\u2019Leary-owned horses</a>, Nicholls\u2019 chances of retaining his crown are looking much brighter than they did a month ago.</p> <p>\u201cThey are forward and they\u2019re all really well, which is good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think we all need to take a pull after today until it rains. There\u2019s no rain forecast.\u201d Quickening ground here was part of the reason for 13 non-runners, including the horse who would have been the star attraction, Sire De Grugy, withdrawn by Gary Moore as the runners left the paddock for the first race.</p> <p>Nicholls felt the surface here was perfectly safe: \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019d rather run now when it\u2019s good ground than I would in the winter when it\u2019s a foot deep.\u201d But with a dry week in prospect, there is unlikely to be any more jump racing of significance until Cheltenham\u2019s first card a week on Friday.</p> <p>That fixture may take on even greater importance because Colin Tizzard said he may choose to send Thistlecrack there for his chasing debut. Thistlecrack is the 7-1 Gold Cup favourite despite not having jumped a fence in public and the interest when he finally does so will be intense. Tizzard had hoped to run him here but wanted more juice in the ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/08/jean-claude-rouget-almanzor-ascot-champions-day-horse-racing\">Jean-Claude Rouget and Almanzor add lustre to Ascot\u2019s Champions Day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nicholls\u2019s other three winners included a battling success in the Persian War with El Bandit, who had been most disappointing until \u201cgetting his head right\u201d in the spring. \u201cHe just needed time,\u201d the trainer reflected, \u201cand I think he could end up anywhere. He\u2019s one of them, you know. You just wouldn\u2019t know what he could do.\u201d Staying hurdle races of quality are now on the agenda.</p> <p>Rebecca Curtis was almost as visibly satisfied as Nicholls with the weekend\u2019s action, her three winners over the two days here proving her stable is in a much better place than at any time in the past season. The Pembrokeshire trainer appeared baffled and dismayed by her charges for much of last winter but whatever was ailing them now seems a thing of the past and in Definite Outcome, who scored here, she has an RSA Chase prospect.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a great start,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back to our own homegrown haylage [feed], which we always did a few seasons back. You just know when your horses are right. I hope they stay that way.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that we had an awful season last year, we still had a few nice winners. I don\u2019t know what it was. Every stable has the odd blip, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Among the coalition of artists denouncing Donald Trump, the White Stripes went one step further this week by creating a T-shirt targeting the Republican nominee. </p> <p>The front of the shirt reads \u201cIcky Trump\u201d, a play on their song Icky Thump, while the back features searing lyrics from the track , \u201cWhite Americans?

In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wtggz\"><strong>Body Count Rising</strong></a>, she and her interviewees expressed all the reasons I don\u2019t watch such shows any more. \u201cTV culture has made the rape and ritualistic murder of women an industry unto itself,\u201d said Mackichan early on. We know this: what was interesting about this documentary was what she did with this information.</p> <p>Journalist Sonia Saraiya said that at a certain point in her career, she began to joke that her job title shouldn\u2019t be \u201cTV critic\u201d but \u201csenior rape correspondent\u201d. Partly, this is simply because there is more telly, more shows being made and shown, many from countries with different broadcasting restrictions to ours. But there are other reasons too, and this programme examined what these might be.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Playwright Nick Payne suggested a year of drama where no women die.

Like \u201ca dog-eared rag being pulled apart\u201d, she said. Like \u201cyou\u2019re halfway there in your head\u201d. After the scene was filmed to the director\u2019s satisfaction, she then had to pull herself together and head home with a cheery, \u201cBye, everyone, see you on set tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone in this programme was careful about their choice of words. Such TV \u201cframes the way we see ourselves\u201d, said Mackichan. \u201cWomen are starting to see themselves through the male gaze,\u201d said criminal sociologist Ruth Penfold-Mounce. \u201cWe can possess this individual. She\u2019s a prop.\u201d Playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/02/nick-payne-playwright-constellations\">Nick Payne</a> wondered why we depict such acts of violence at all, as showing it will \u201cshift the focus on to the act itself, rather then how the person (victim) feels about that act\u201d. Mackichan discussed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/20/shetland-rape-lasting-trauma-reality-horror-enough\"><em>Shetland</em></a>, which did not show the violent act.

  "<p>Corporate multiplex weepies can do strange things to your emotions.

Among the finest and flintiest in the recent spate of films tackling the European migrant influx, Jonas Carpagnino\u2019s serenely confident debut (not a documentary, though there\u2019s little narrative varnish here) tracks two friends from Burkina Faso as they make a new life in Italy, sparing us no complication or point of frustration in the adjustment process. It\u2019s not expressly political film-making: Carpagnino invites viewers to consider his two subjects (beautifully played by Koudous Seihon and Alassane Sy) not as symbols or statistics, but as lively, imperfect people in even less perfect circumstances: amid the broader crisis, they bicker, bruise and rock out to Rihanna. Deservedly a big deal on the festival circuit last year, it\u2019s quietly slipping straight to DVD here.</p> <p>StudioCanal\u2019s giving the same low-key treatment to <strong>Shelley</strong> (StudioCanal, 18), also well worth rescuing from the shelf: Iranian director Ali Abbasi\u2019s Danish-set film is a refreshingly humane, slow-simmering spin on the often lurid pregnancy-horror genre. Soberly following the eerie fallout when a wealthy liberal couple employ their immigrant maid as a surrogate, the film adds all manner of complex social stitching to its velvety atmospherics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5e707a3f8b7d0972f75ec99d71b507675aa0944\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5e707a3f8b7d0972f75ec99d71b507675aa0944/269_0_2503_1502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Turgid corned-beef hash\u2019: Duncan Jones\u2019s Warcraft: The Beginning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Turgid corned-beef hash\u2019: Duncan Jones\u2019s Warcraft: The Beginning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s already among the bigger flubs of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/aug/09/summer-blockbuster-season-bad-box-office-suicide-squad\" title=\"\">bleak summer for blockbusters</a>, so I shan\u2019t spend too much time telling you what you\u2019ve already heard about Duncan Jones\u2019s optimistically titled video-game adaptation <strong>Warcraft: The Beginning </strong>(Universal, 12): a turgid corned-beef hash of multiple familiar fantasy realms and aesthetics, it might just be the most biliously ugly film ever to cost \u00a3125m. I\u2019m not going to make any great claims for <strong>Race</strong> (Spirit, PG), but it\u2019s a film with some time for beauty. A diverting if overly smooth-sanded Wiki-biopic of trailblazing Olympic athlete Jesse Owens, the film gazes in gilded awe upon his aesthetic prowess, though invites more questions than it perhaps expects to answer when a half-formed subplot semi-celebrates Hitler\u2019s favourite film-maker Leni Riefenstahl for doing the same at the 1936 Munich Olympics.</p> <p>Two of this week\u2019s re-releases are rather special. The Criterion Collection\u2019s latest addition is a double bill: <strong>The Emigrants</strong>/<strong>The New Land</strong> (Sony, 15) gives bright new life to Swedish director Jan Troell\u2019s ravishing yet largely unromanticised 19th-century family saga of a Sm\u00e5land clan journeying to Minnesota. Though they met with Oscar-approved crossover success in the 1970s, the films seem to have fallen out of fashion a bit among cinephiles, but their stately muscularity has aged very well. Meanwhile, the Quay Brothers, the most spookily singular force in stop-motion animation, get the Blu-ray retrospective they deserve in the short film omnibus set <strong>Inner Sanctums \u2013 Quay Brothers: The Collected Animated Films 1979-2013</strong> (BFI, 15) \u2013 which includes, beyond the obvious and treasured content, a new, short Christopher Nolan documentary on the duo\u2019s curious workings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e000027b77744801187a6ca70fe7fbbb6b12915d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e000027b77744801187a6ca70fe7fbbb6b12915d/0_269_2650_1591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman in Jan Troell\u2019s The Emigrants.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann in Jan Troell\u2019s The Emigrants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.ronaldgrantarchive.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-50-percent-content-original-programming-cfo-1201865902/\" title=\"\">drive towards having 50% original content</a> is gathering pace. This week saw the online release not just of Ava DuVernay\u2019s eagerly awaited race-relations study <strong>13th</strong> \u2013 see below for Wendy Ide\u2019s take on that \u2013 but also the premiere of <strong>The Siege of Jadotville</strong>, which dramatises the eponymous colonial-era siege in the Congo, as Irish UN troops battled Katangese rebels in 1961. Richie Smyth\u2019s film offers a light grounding of measured political context before launching into rousing gung-ho territory \u2013 anchored sturdily by Jamie Dornan who, after this and the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/anthropoid-review-jamie-dornan-cillian-murphy-ss-general\" title=\"\"><em>Anthropoid</em></a>, has probably had his fill of bullet-pocked standoffs for a while. Thinly scripted but technically hale-and-hearty, it\u2019s a slab of action history that looks entirely cinema-ready.</p>"
