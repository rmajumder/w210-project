  "<p>Black patients are about half as likely to be prescribed opioid medicines in the emergency department than white patients, according to a new study. </p> <p>The findings, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0159224\">published on Monday in Plos One</a>, are the latest to show that minorities are treated differently when it comes to pain management.<strong> </strong></p> <p>\u201cA black patient with the same level of pain and everything else being accounted for was much less likely to receive an opioid prescription than a white patient with the same characteristics,\u201d said study co-author Astha Singhal, an assistant professor at Boston University\u2019s dental medicine school.</p> <p>To determine whether there was a racial bias in pain medication prescriptions, the researchers looked at more than 60m records of pain-related emergency department visits from 2007 to 2011 for people aged 18 to 65.</p> <p>Five conditions were examined and divided into two categories: definitive and non-definitive. The first referred to conditions that were easily diagnosed \u2013 kidney stones and long-bone fractures \u2013 and the second to conditions that are not: toothache, abdominal pain and back pain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/prescription-drugs-what-if-you-depend-on-opioids-chronic-pain\">War on prescription drugs: what if you depend on opioids to live a decent life?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Black patients had about half the odds of being prescribed opioids compared to white patients for non-definitive conditions, according to the study, which Singhal co-authored with Renee Hsia of UC San Francisco and Yu-Yu Tien from the University of Iowa.</p> <p>The findings may also point to a contributing factor to the opioid addiction crisis that claims 78 lives in the US a day and has primarily affected the white population, particularly people <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/31/rural-us-counties-hiv-outbreak-cdc\">in rural areas</a> and the north-east. \u201cWe think this type of differential prescribing could be contributing to it [the crisis],\u201d said Singhal.</p> <p>The study found no race-based differences for definitive conditions or toothaches, which Singhal said could be because emergency room doctors may be quicker to treat these conditions with medication because they are not dental experts. </p> <p>\u201cThis study unfortunately tells us what we already know \u2013 black patients are improperly treated for pain and that is mostly because of their skin color,\u201d said Keisha Ray, a postdoctoral fellow with the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.</p> <p>She said the fundamental problem is that black patients are treated as an \u201cother\u201d. </p> <p>This has been suggested for decades, but was starkly depicted in <a href=\"https://news.virginia.edu/content/study-links-disparities-pain-management-racial-bias\">an April study</a> about how disparities in pain management may be attributable to bias from medical providers who believe things such as that black people age more slowly than white people, and that black people\u2019s blood coagulates more quickly than white peoples.</p> <p>\u201cBlack patients are not afforded the luxury of being seen in EDs, physician offices, and clinics as just patients in need of help and healing,\u201d Ray said. \u201cRather they are seen as less than human, drug seekers and overall exaggerators.\u201d</p> <p>Ray and others said that because some clinicians assume black people are more likely to be addicts, they are less likely to receive pain medication. </p> <p>Christopher Ervin, an advisor to the Black Women\u2019s Health Imperative advocacy group, said there is a history of assuming black people are more likely to be addicts, so even if they receive adequate pain treatment in the emergency room, they may not receive a prescription for it once they are discharged.</p> <p>Ervin said these study findings also show how differences in race can amplify the power discordance that exists between a patient and doctor.</p> <p>For instance, a clinician may not recognize someone\u2019s pain because of cultural differences in describing pain. \u201cMany cultures may not be as demonstrative or vocal or assertive about pain and say: \u2018Hey, I am hurting,\u2019 particularly when, women in color in general, being vocal is not always to your benefit,\u201d Ervin said. </p> <p>And the dearth of black physicians exacerbates the situation. Only 4% of physicians are black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, and that number is not expected to improve: the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/10/24/449893318/there-were-fewer-black-men-in-medical-school-in-2014-than-in-1978\">association also found that in 2014</a> fewer black men were in medical school than in 1978. </p> <p>Ervin and the study authors said their findings show the benefits of incorporating sensitivity in medical training to show providers their inherent biases. </p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that culture of diversity in your training and in your development, when will you get it?\u201d Ervin said. \u201cUntil someone sues you.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>The complete balls-up of the census on Tuesday night should be absolutely no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to the way the Australian Bureau of Statistics has been run and how it has been treated by the government.

I spend whole days looking at data, and as one who will mine the census data when it is finally released I had no issue with completing my census form.

It rather easily raises the question: if the ABS can\u2019t even be trusted to properly collect our data, how can we trust them to keep it?</p> <p>The reality is almost no one outside of the ABS was surprised the site crashed. It was utterly foreseeable.</p> <p>And suggestions of a DDoS attack are completely beside the point. When shifting to an online survey of such a size the first item on the risk management list would have been the ability to cope with large numbers, and the second would be the ability to cope with a DDoS attack.</p> <p>Being told that a router overloaded just screams incompetence. </p> <p>The signs were evident long ago that the ABS was struggling.</p> <p>Early last year \u2013 in what was mostly understood to be a desperate attempt to wake up the government \u2013 the ABS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/19/census-in-2016-in-doubt-as-10-year-data-collection-considered\">floated the idea</a> of moving the census from every five years to every 10 years.</p> <p>The problem had nothing to do with efficacy of a five-yearly census, but was all about funding. After years of \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d the ABS was holding itself together with duct tape and prayers.</p> <p>The census in 2011 cost $440m, so for an agency under severe budget constraint, stopping a half a billion dollar exercise is not just one way to save money, but given the importance of the census, is also a good way to make the issue of ABS funding very public.</p> <p>And it worked \u2013 in <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2015-16/content/bp2/html/bp2_expense-21.htm\">the 2015 budget</a> the government included $234.7m in funding over five years to the ABS.</p> <p>But it was too late to help this year\u2019s census and too late to undo what has been a long running and bipartisan approach.</p> <p>The ALP under Kevin Rudd in 2008 cut funding to the ABS along with other government agencies as part of its \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d. As a result the ABS cut the job vacancy survey.</p> <p>It meant they cut the survey in August 2008 just as the global financial crisis was about to hit, and thus at the precise moment the figures would have been most useful, given job vacancies are a leading indicator of employment:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly job vacancies\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qBkyt/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other funding cuts meant the ABS had to find savings elsewhere. </p> <p>One saving was in the labour force figures. In 2013 it reduced the sample size of the survey, which meant that whereas from February 1978 to <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/2CB5DE7E65604164CA257BC00013E7DB?opendocument\">June 2013</a> the unemployment rate had a 95% confidence interval of plus or minus 0.2 percentage points, since <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/8BF7E9F356270F54CA257BE3001DDD2F?opendocument\">July 2013</a> it has been plus or minus 0.4 percentage points:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployment rate with 95% confidence intervals\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lkW5h/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Soon after the change a number of pretty bizarre employment figures began to get released \u2013 something I noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/mar/17/labour-reports-taken-pinch-salt\">in March 2014</a>.</p> <p>The funding cuts continued under the Abbott government.

The result was a complete shemozzle.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/sep/15/abs-employment-figures-for-august-statistical-aberration-or-recovery\">August 2013, the ABS</a> reported that employment in one month grew by 121,000 \u2013 the biggest jump ever recorded:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Monthly employment growth - August 2014\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LwG2L/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>No one believed it, and neither did the ABS. <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Previousproducts/6202.0Main%20Features2Sep%202014?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=6202.0&amp;issue=Sep%202014&amp;num=&amp;view=\">The next month</a> it admitted its seasonally adjusted figures from July to September 2014 were complete bollocks and to be ignored.</p> <p>It was a major indictment for an organisation to admit that the most high profile of its surveys was not to be trusted. Perhaps the only survey the ABS does which is more high profile is the census, and this time round we have a similar result.</p> <p>Due to abject failure to consult openly about its proposed changes of the holding of people\u2019s names, and an utter inability to explain the reasons for those changes, a mistrust of the census began to arise.</p> <p>Now mistrust of the census is almost an Australian tradition, but this time round there was little heed of what were legitimate (if, in my view, overstated) concerns. </p> <p>While the ABS itself was shown to be incapable of adequately responding, so too was the government. From December 2014 to September 2015 Kelly O\u2019Dwyer had oversight of the ABS. In her time on the front bench, O\u2019Dwyer has not exactly met expectations. Her abilities, shall we say, seemed much more sparkling when they were not being used while she sat on the backbench, but she did at least secure that extra funding for the ABS. Prior to the election, Alex Hawke had carriage.</p> <p>But after the election, the prime minister also showed a complete disregard of the census. It wasn\u2019t until Wednesday last week that it was clear that Michael McCormack was the minister responsible \u2013 less than a week before the census.</p> <p>And even worse, his attempts to assuage public fears were pathetic.</p> <p>He suggested that worries about <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/minister-says-census-no-worse-than-facebook-as-nick-xenophon-risks-jail-20160808-gqnobg.html\">the privacy fears</a> about the census were not a big deal given the people worried were also using Facebook. Such a statement indicates that McCormack is woefully out of his depth and totally unqualified to handle this responsibility. His attempts this morning to suggests the DDoS attack was not an attack because the attack didn\u2019t succeed, even though it did, does nothing to allay fears that our government is run by fools.</p> <p>But really when you get down to it, the failure of the census on Tuesday night is not just about poor risk management, poor government oversight, poor administration; rather it is as the ABS\u2019s head, David Kalisch suggested part of a \u201cconfluence of events\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/the-census-farce-is-reminiscent-of-wile-e-coyote-running-off-a-cliff-in-pursuit-of-road-runner\">The census farce is reminiscent of Wile E Coyote running off a cliff in pursuit of Road Runner | Dan Nolan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that confluence of events is not about DDoS attacks and the failure of a router (god help us, really?) but of a generation of thinking that the public sector can be cut every year and somehow continue to fulfil all its functions. It is the culmination of thinking that paying fewer people to do the same work and to put off spending to upgrade IT systems to \u201csave money\u201d is good budgeting.</p> <p>It is part of the belief that a generation of privatising and outsourcing work to the private sector does not have institutional impacts on talent and quality of service in the public sector.</p> <p>The ABS does work that for the most part could not be done with the same level of trust by the private sector. Yes the funding cuts and \u201cefficiency dividends\u201d have helped save some money over the past few years, but the cost to the reputation of the ABS from this bungle is enormous.</p> <p>And the ABS, above all, relies on its reputation.</p> <p>There will no doubt be the desire to call for someone to be sacked due to this failure \u2013 and rightly so.

That figure showed at 3% but we know the real figure is far higher.\u201d</p> <p> Kett says there have been government efforts to support disabled people by including them in wider national poverty alleviation strategies.

  "<p>Around 2,000 years ago, Muziris was one of India\u2019s most important trading ports. According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akana%E1%B9%89%C5%AB%E1%B9%9Fu\">Akananuru</a>, a collection of Tamil poetry from the period, it was \u201cthe city where the beautiful vessels, the masterpieces of the Yavanas [<a href=\"https://books.google.co.in/books?id=6vglAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT170&amp;lpg=PT170&amp;dq=Yavana+westerners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d-qYAO2wZ4&amp;sig=9gDyFXd4tFczy5DsVvhYb37yp14&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz6Pz1qbbOAhWJso8KHc2qBNo4ChDoAQggMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Yavana%20westerners&amp;f=false\">Westerners</a>], stir white foam on the Periyar, river of Kerala, arriving with gold and departing with pepper.\u201d</p> <p>Another poem speaks of Muziris (also known as Muciripattanam or Muciri) as \u201cthe city where liquor abounds\u201d, which \u201cbestows wealth to its visitors indiscriminately\u201d with \u201cgold deliveries, carried by the ocean-going ships and brought to the river bank by local boats\u201d.</p> <p>The Roman author Pliny, in his Natural History, called Muziris \u201cthe first emporium of India\u201d. The city appears prominently on the Tabula Peutingeriana, a fifth-century map of the world as seen from Rome. But from thereon, the story of this great Indian port becomes hazy. As reports of its location grow more sporadic, it literally drops off the map.</p> <p>In modern-day India, Muziris was much more of a legend than a real city \u2013 until archaeological excavations in the southern state of Kerala, starting in 2004, <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/2004/03/23/stories/2004032303340500.htm\">sparked reports</a> of a mysterious lost port. Though the archaeologists cannot be certain, they \u2013 and, with <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pattanam-is-not-muziris-asserts-mgs/article8287845.ece\">some exceptions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_vD_KK3Dto\">historians too</a> \u2013 now believe they have located the site of Muziris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aadf0eb59fac9821f24a184ca8ec043a8a8e15a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aadf0eb59fac9821f24a184ca8ec043a8a8e15a1/0_0_2163_1432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Excavations in the village of Pattanam, Kerala, have raised questions about whether the site is \u2018urban\u2019 enough to be Muziris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Excavations in the village of Pattanam, Kerala, have raised questions about whether the site is \u2018urban\u2019 enough to be Muziris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KCHR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cThis was a centre of paramount importance for Roman trade,\u201d says Federico De Romanis, associate professor of Roman history at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. \u201cWhat made it absolutely unique was the considerable amounts of black pepper exported from Muziris. We are talking about thousands of tons.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to pepper, De Romanis says, exports included both local products \u2013 ivory, pearls, spices such as malabathron \u2013 and those from other parts of India, including semi-precious stones, silks and the aromatic root nard. \u201cThese attest to commercial relationships nurtured with the Gangetic valley and east Himalayan regions.\u201d</p> <p>In the other direction, ships arrived with gold, coral, fine glassware, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/amphora-pottery\">amphorae</a> of wine, olive oil and the fermented fish sauce called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/26/garum-sauce-colatura-di-alici-italy-fish\">garum</a>. But the value of this trade was lopsided: De Romanis says Pliny the Elder estimated Rome\u2019s annual deficit caused by imbalanced trade with India at 50m sesterces (500,000 gold coins of a little less than eight grammes), with \u201cMuziris representing the lion\u2019s share of it\u201d.</p> <p> Maritime trade between Muziris and Rome started in the first century BC, when it became known that sailing through the Red Sea to the horn of Africa, then due east along the 12th latitude, led to the Kerala coast. \u201cMuziris was entirely dependent on foreign, especially Roman, demand for pepper,\u201d De Romanis says. So when the Roman empire\u2019s economy began to struggle in the third century AD, he believes the trade in pepper reconfigured itself, and Muziris lost its importance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b224d2cd693bbe591fc9a52ac4e4eeac1074a88f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b224d2cd693bbe591fc9a52ac4e4eeac1074a88f/0_0_1288_930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muziris pictured (bottom right) in the Tabula Peutingeriana, a fifth-century map of the world as seen from Rome\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muziris pictured (bottom right) in the Tabula Peutingeriana, a fifth-century map of the world as seen from Rome</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: KCHR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Dr PJ Cherian, director of the Kerala Council for Historical Research, confirms there are few references to Muziris after the fifth century AD. It had been generally assumed that Muziris referred to the port of Kodungallur, which had been put out of commission by devastating floods in 1341 \u2013 but excavations there did not turn up anything older than the 13th century.</p> <p>Travel 11 kilometres by road from Kodungallur, however, and you reach the village of Pattanam. For years, children there had been <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/in-search-of-muziris/article790614.ece\">collecting beads</a> that would rise to the surface during the monsoon season. After an initial dig in 2004, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHL9hZa21pc\">systematic excavations</a> by Cherian and his colleagues began in 2007. Soon, he says, it was clear they had discovered a major archaeological site.</p> <p>Over nine seasons of excavations, they have found Roman amphorae (for the first time on the Keralan coast), a wharf-like structure, a dug-out canoe that is approximately 2,000 years old \u2013 plus foundations, bricks and tiles, tools and artefacts made of iron, lead and copper, glass beads, gold ornaments and semi-precious stones clearly meant for export.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d0162be7a4be08fb37013b24cd657fd0a9f2bc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d0162be7a4be08fb37013b24cd657fd0a9f2bc5/0_0_3106_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pattanam artefacts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"990\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local children have collected 2,000-year-old beads at Pattanam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohamed A/KCHR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> So, <a href=\"http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2708/stories/20100423270806200.htm\">is Pattanam the site</a> of fabled Muziris? There isn\u2019t clinching evidence yet, but Cherian thinks it\u2019s likely. He is also tired of questions about the Roman connection, asking: \u201cWhen they excavate a Roman site in Europe, do they obsess similarly about whether it traded with India?\u201d To him, an integral part of the excavation is what it reveals about the people who actually lived there.</p> <p> Tathagata Neogi, of the Indian Institute of Archaeology, explains the stages of occupation in Pattanam using a large photograph of an excavated trench\u2019s cross-section. Human habitation began there around 1000BC, marked by characteristic Iron Age black and redware pottery, while the period between 500 and 300BC marks a mixed phase.</p> <p>\u201cWe think this is when Pattanam began making the transition from a village to a trade hub,\u201d Neogi says. The period from 300BC to AD500 is densely packed with evidence for trade both within and outside India. Burnt bricks and tiles, terracotta ring wells and coins suggest a thriving settlement. Small amounts of west Asian pottery in the earlier portions of this segment provide evidence for pre-Roman maritime trade. After AD500 the record thins out \u2013 until AD1500, when Chinese and European ceramics are found.</p> <h2>Is Pattanam \u2018urban\u2019?</h2> <p> Today, Pattanam is a village situated four kilometres from the sea. The vegetation is typical of the region: tall arcing palms, squat plantains, vines and creepers, near-flourescent monsoon grass. There are sporadic houses, a temple, a village office and sudden channels of water.</p> <p>The archaeological mound at Pattanam is around 70 hectares; atop it sits a museum displaying <a href=\"https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.in/2014/12/unearthing-pattanam-histories-cultures.html\">finds</a> from the excavations. It is curious, Cherian notes, that a village should be named Pattanam, a word that means market-town or trading port across south India. </p> <p> Some historians \u2013 such as Rajan Gurukkal, author of Rethinking Classical Indo-Roman Trade \u2013 have argued that Pattanam (which he believes <em>is</em> the location of Muziris) was likely nothing more elaborate than <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kerala-historians-at-loggerheads-over-archaeological-findings-at-pattanam/article6056562.ece\">a colony of Mediterranean merchants</a>, plus the inland traders and artisans who dealt with them. Gurukkal\u2019s theory is based on the apparent absence of permanent structures, and the seeming disconnect of the materials and skills found at Pattanam with those of the wider region. He suggests the colony might even have been seasonal, inhabited only when ships arrived for trade.</p> <p> Such a debate comes down to what is meant by a city or urban settlement. According to Cherian, \u201cUrban is a complicated word \u2013 to me, it means \u2018organised\u2019, \u2018thought out\u2019, \u2018planned\u2019.\u201d And he sees evidence of this in Pattanam: \u201cIt was certainly a city, but of its time.\u201d</p> <p>The excavations have revealed what appear to be toilets, drains and terracotta ring wells, and these \u2013 along with raised foundations aligned in one direction \u2013 suggest a planned settlement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed5965e075a1e75797ce59eeb607f0e198c90862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed5965e075a1e75797ce59eeb607f0e198c90862/0_316_4912_2948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Muziris, India.

  "<p>In 2013, at a conference on endangered languages, a retired teacher named Linda Lambrecht announced the extraordinary discovery of a previously unknown language. Lambrecht \u2013 who is Chinese-Hawaiian, 71 years old, warm but no-nonsense \u2013 called it <a href=\"http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/21440949/nearly-lost-language-discovered-in-hawaii\">Hawaii Sign Language</a>, or HSL. In front of a room full of linguists, she demonstrated that its core vocabulary \u2013 words such as \u201cmother\u201d, \u201cpig\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d \u2013 was distinct from that of other sign languages.</p> <p>The linguists were immediately convinced. William O\u2019Grady, the chair of the linguistics department at the University of Hawaii, called it \u201cthe first time in 80 years that a new language has been discovered in the United States \u2014 and maybe the last time.\u201d But the new language found 80 years ago was in remote Alaska, whereas HSL was hiding in plain sight in Honolulu, a metropolitan area of nearly a million people. It was the kind of discovery that made the world seem larger.</p> <p>The last-minute arrival of recognition and support for HSL was a powerful, almost surreal vindication for Lambrecht, whose first language is HSL. For decades, it was stigmatised or ignored; now the language has acquired an agreed-upon name, an official \u201clanguage code\u201d from the <a href=\"http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html\">International Organization for Standardization</a>, the attention of linguists around the world, and a three-year grant from the<a href=\"http://www.eldp.net/\"> Endangered Languages Documentation Programme</a> at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2016/oct/03/the-race-to-save-a-dying-language-podcast\">The race to save a dying language \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But just as linguists were substantiating its existence, HSL stood on the brink of extinction, remembered by just a handful of signers. Unless the language made a miraculous recovery, Lambrecht feared that her announcement might turn out to be HSL\u2019s obituary.</p> <p>Three years after announcing its existence, Lambrecht is still unearthing her language sign by sign. She may be the only person in the world who still uses HSL on a regular basis, signing into a camera while a linguist named James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodward and a handful of graduate students from the University of Hawaii document her every move.</p> <p>Led by Lambrecht, Woodward, and researcher Barbara Earth, the project aims to document what may be the last-ever conversations of native HSL signers. The goal is to record at least 20 hours of high-quality video footage of natural HSL and then transcribe, translate, and archive it. The researchers hope that this work \u2013 along with a series of illustrated handbooks depicting over 1,000 signs, and a regular class at the University of Hawaii set to begin next year \u2013 will jump-start the revitalisation of HSL.</p> <p>The project faces numerous obstacles. The first is the scepticism of many of the remaining signers themselves. Hawaii\u2019s tiny Deaf community is deeply divided. Some say HSL is not a real language, others see it as backward; still others are sceptical of Lambrecht.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33d46d9ee1e159fa4329fb85cc2772fa7ade4178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33d46d9ee1e159fa4329fb85cc2772fa7ade4178/0_0_556_1155/481.jpg\" alt=\"Dying Language\" width=\"481\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Christian Montenegro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: dutchuncle.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the gravest threat to HSL is <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language\">American Sign Language</a> (ASL), which is advancing across the globe \u2013 from Hawaii to Thailand to Togo \u2013 just as fast as English. The Deaf world, intensely local until recently, is consolidating and globalising in unprecedented ways. And the forward march of ASL, which in certain ways brings people together, also poses a significant danger to many of the estimated 400 sign languages used all over the world \u2013 most of which we know nothing about.</p> <p>Hawaii is a bellwether, but Deaf culture all around the world \u2013 for many on the inside it is a \u201ccapital-D\u201d culture, not a \u201clower-case-d\u201d disability \u2013 faces threats from every direction. The \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of deaf students means that they are placed in hearing schools, where they are encouraged to be just like everyone else but with \u201cspecial needs\u201d, in a process that some call deliberate assimilation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/16/bionic-ears-cochlear-implants-transformed-lives-children\">Cochlear implants</a> (and the potential of gene therapy) even more fundamentally endanger sign languages \u2013 some Deaf activists condemn such \u201ccures\u201d as <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/sociologylens/2011/02/24/cochlear-implants-miracle-technology-or-cultural-genocide/\">being akin to genocide</a>.</p> <p>If the loss of a particular language such as HSL means the end of a whole expressive system, the disappearance of sign language in general \u2013 the only fully fledged form of language completely independent of speech \u2013 would permanently impoverish human communication.</p> <p>Like every natural language, HSL is the evolved product of a specific history, the unconscious creation of a community. For it to survive, local signers will have to make a deliberate choice to use it. The same may be increasingly true of Deafness itself. The story of HSL raises crucial questions in an age of globalisation: Do cultures on the margins have a future? Will enough people choose to be that different, and will they do it together?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Though they parallel spoken languages in certain ways, sign languages represent a fundamentally different way of communicating. They neither derive from, nor correspond to, spoken languages. Nor are all sign languages mutually intelligible, as hearing people often assume \u2013 they are as various as spoken languages.</p> <p>Their historical evolution is distinctive. Infants can sign before they can speak, and the great sign language linguist <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/11/us/william-stokoe-jr-sign-language-advocate-dies-at-80.html\">William Stokoe</a> argued that sign may have preceded speech in the history of human language. It\u2019s considered normal for one in 1,000 children to be born profoundly deaf, but places with higher rates of inherited deafness \u2013 such as the village of <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/deaf-arab-villagers-create-new-language/\">al-Sayyid in Israel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/theres-a-village-in-bali-where-everyone-knows-sign-language-511\">Bengkala in Bali</a> \u2013 have been natural hotspots for sign languages.</p> <p>For sign languages, and for Deaf culture more broadly, intergenerational transmission is far from straightforward. The vast majority of deaf adults give birth to hearing children, while most deaf children are born to hearing adults who have no connection with the Deaf communities.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Signing is not miming, and signs are not just gestures that anyone can immediately grasp</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Signing is not miming, and signs are not \u201cjust\u201d gestures that anyone can immediately grasp. \u201cIconic\u201d signs, where the gesture self-evidently expresses meaning, play a role in every sign language, but even they can be wonderfully nuanced. In HSL, for instance, \u201ccry\u201d is signed with spread-finger \u201ctears\u201d running out from the sides of the eyes, while \u201cbawl\u201d has the fingers running straight down. Still, abstraction and convention are essential, just as in speech, because not everything can be expressed with self-evident gestures. There is nothing obvious, for example, about the HSL sign for \u201cman\u201d or \u201cboy\u201d: a spread hand moving down across the head.</p> <p>For most of recorded history, sign languages have been effectively invisible to hearing people. It was not until William Stokoe\u2019s groundbreaking study of ASL, published in 1960, that any sign language had been analysed as a fully fledged communication system with a grammar of its own. In 1965 Stokoe published an ASL dictionary, also the first of its kind.</p> <p>Now that the kind of geographical isolation that once bred new languages is no more, sign languages represent something of a final frontier. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know how many sign languages there are,\u201d says Albert Bickford of the global sign languages team at the language database <a href=\"https://www.ethnologue.com/\">Ethnologue</a>. \u201cIt seems reasonable to assume that the majority of sign languages currently in use in the world have not been discovered yet,\u201d Victoria Nyst, a linguist at Leiden University, told me.</p> <p>The most recent edition of Ethnologue, published earlier this year, mentions 141 sign languages. Over a hundred more have been reported, Bickford says, but no solid information on them exists \u2013 just the barest indication that Deaf people may sign differently in a particular place. We may never know much about these languages, or even confirm their existence.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lambrecht\u2019s announcement in 2013<strong> </strong>was the culmination of a lifetime of work. Born deaf, she hears almost nothing, barely even the noise of a siren blaring in her street. \u201cI grew up very frustrated, thinking I\u2019m not deaf, I\u2019m not deaf, I\u2019m hearing! I want to be an actress, I want to be a dancer, I want to be a movie star!\u201d Lambrecht told me late last year at the University of Hawaii. \u201cI was so frustrated that I couldn\u2019t be those things.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.linfo.org/teletype.html\">Teletype</a>, an early form of texting, and <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/closed-captioning-television\">closed captioning</a>, which made TV and films accessible, were life-changing developments for her when they became widespread in the 1970s. \u201cAfter that, I settled down,\u201d she said. \u201cI hated being deaf until that communication barrier broke down, when all those devices came out.\u201d</p> <p>The youngest of seven children, Lambrecht started signing HSL at home in the late 1940s \u2013 learning it from two of her older brothers, who were both deaf like her. She was probably one of the last people anywhere to learn HSL naturally, as a first language, and picking it up from family was particularly unusual. By then, the dorm at Hawaii\u2019s only deaf school was the closest thing HSL had to a homeland \u2013 it was there that one of her brothers learned it.</p> <p>But ASL was already coming in. Soon after the second world war, an unprecedented number of Deaf mainlanders came to Hawaii to work or retire. Within a few decades, ASL was dominant, HSL almost dormant. \u201cWe would get a lot of insults, a lot of negativity,\u201d Lambrecht recalled. \u201cDeaf people here would put themselves into an inferior category compared to the people who brought ASL. People said, \u2018They\u2019re from America, they\u2019re white people, they know better.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lambrecht made a living by teaching ASL for 33 years, mostly to hearing people, but in her spare time she pursued HSL, tracking down old signers in hospitals and nursing homes. \u201cWe used to go to the other islands to drum up people, and now they\u2019re all dead, dead, dead,\u201d her husband, Jeff, said. Interested mainlanders had documented a small number of local signs, and they encouraged Lambrecht to do more. Years in, she realised she had been collecting the remains of a complete and original language.</p> <p>Without funding and without linguistic expertise, Lambrecht\u2019s efforts stalled until 2007, when a woman named Barbara Earth came to Hawaii and enrolled in her ASL class. After a career working on gender and development in Asia and Africa, Earth was going deaf and wanted to learn how to sign.</p> <p>Embracing Lambrecht\u2019s cause and digging into HSL history, Earth hunted for money to support the project. Three years later, she found enough for a pilot study, interviewing 19 elderly Deaf people and two children of Deaf adults on four Hawaiian islands. William O\u2019Grady, the linguistics department chair at the University of Hawaii, agreed to host the project at the university: \u201cBarbara knocked on my door and said there was an unknown sign language here in Hawaii, and she needed help to prove that it existed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41038fc68fde4481e56dc6fdabd240c3a3fa9acf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41038fc68fde4481e56dc6fdabd240c3a3fa9acf/0_60_5870_3523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Lambrecht, left, teaches Hawaii Sign Language.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Lambrecht, left, teaches Hawaii Sign Language.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Tanner Photography, LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An initial estimate of up to 280 surviving HSL signers was soon revised down to 40, then down to just 10 or so old-timers still likely to be competent in HSL. ASL had made deep inroads even among these signers, but there was evidence, especially from Lambrecht\u2019s signs, that HSL was distinct, and lay close enough to the surface to be recovered. Spoken languages such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/basque.shtml\">Basque</a>, Welsh, and Hawaiian have come back from the brink of extinction \u2013 could HSL be the first sign language to do it?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For James Woodward, the mass extinction<strong> </strong>of sign languages is bound up in prejudice and chauvinism. He believes that every local sign language should have the chance to become a valued, modernised language of education, giving communities a choice and a chance at continuity. Like the spread of English, the triumph of ASL might enable communication, but convenience cannot replace intimacy and history, which people soon forget ever existed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/07/british-sign-language-changing\">Signs of the times: deaf community minds its language</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One day late last year in Honolulu, I sat in on a gathering that included some of the last active HSL signers. Besides Lambrecht, there were the three other elderly signers who had joined the project within the last year. Their funny and furious signing was almost all in ASL, as usual, but here and there old bits of HSL were surfacing.</p> <p>\u201cIs this Deaf culture or what!?\u201d Hilda Lopez signed. \u201cI love it, I love it, I love it.\u201d She kissed her own hands as she signed. \u201cHSL is really number one in my life. The ones who don\u2019t like it are small-minded!\u201d</p> <p>Lopez explained to me that her first name in English is Hilda, but her name sign \u2013 her real, everyday name in the Deaf community \u2013 is a pointing gesture towards the mouth, based on an incident at her fifth birthday party when someone fired a BB gun and shot out some of her teeth. It\u2019s a classic HSL name sign: blunt, comic and personal, based on physical characteristics and memorable incidents.</p> <p>Like any language, HSL can be broken down by linguists, but its personality, its characteristic style of discourse, is harder to get a handle on. Even when signing ASL, Lopez seems to embody the HSL style. \u201cWhen they\u2019re using ASL, people talk too long and make other people bored,\u201d she told me. \u201cHSL is short and thrilling and fast.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>HSL has a bigger 'signing space' than ASL \u2013 anywhere from the top of the head to the bottom of the torso</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>HSL has a bigger \u201csigning space\u201d than ASL \u2013 meaningful signs can be made anywhere from the top of the head to the bottom of the torso. Signs that occur not on the hands but elsewhere on the body also play an important role. \u201cKick\u201d is signed only with the leg, for instance, while a raised eyebrow is a vital bit of grammar, signalling a yes or no question, or a conditional clause beginning with \u201cif\u201d. The \u201cvocalisations\u201d accompanying certain signs, which fellow signers can sometimes lip-read, echo different spoken languages: borrowed words from <a href=\"http://www.polynesia.com/polynesian_culture/hawaii/languages.html#.V6m7VzYrKuo\">Hawaiian</a>, English and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/12/living/pidgin-english-hawaii/\">Hawaii Pidgin</a>.</p> <p>Lopez thinks and talks to herself in sign. \u201cI\u2019m 100% Deaf!\u201d she said proudly. \u201cI don\u2019t hear sound, but I can feel it, I feel the body vibrations in my chest: bass drums, police sirens. The only thing I can hear is fireworks \u2014 I don\u2019t like the smell of them, they make me sick, but I like the noise and vibration.\u201d</p> <p>Lopez never knew her biological parents, but she is fiercely proud of her <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/06/native-hawaiian-population/\">Native Hawaiian</a> and mixed-ethnic roots. At least one piece of evidence, an 1821 letter discovered by Barbara Earth, seems to link HSL to the Native Hawaiian past. In that year, an American missionary, newly arrived in the <a href=\"http://www.hawaiiankingdom.org/political-history.shtml\">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>, met a deaf man and bargained with him over 40 sticks of firewood and a pig. Some of the man\u2019s signs were \u201cin common use\u201d, seemingly among both deaf and hearing people, wrote the missionary. The signs he recorded for \u201cpig\u201d, \u201cmoney\u201d, \u201csee\u201d, and a system of counting by clapping, are still present in HSL today.</p> <p>The rate of inherited deafness in Hawaii is normal. But by the late 19th century, waves of Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese and Filipino immigrants were coming to Hawaii to work on the American-run plantations, and a new multi-racial Deaf community took shape in Honolulu, including boot shiners, launderers, and flower sellers. There was even what a contemporary newspaper called a \u201cfancy deaf wedding\u201d, where 80 of the guests used \u201cthe sign language\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe turning point, the beginning of the end of HSL,\u201d according to Barbara Earth, was the founding of Hawaii\u2019s deaf school in 1914. Like most schools at the time, it promoted <a href=\"http://www.deafwebsites.com/education/oralism.html\">oralism</a>, the system of lip-reading and speaking that is almost universally despised in Deaf communities for being painful, unnatural and ineffective. But for a while the school was also a unique environment for the clandestine transmission of HSL. One former student, Norman Galapin, told me that he learned HSL \u201con the playgrounds and in the dorm\u201d, though \u201cif the teacher saw you signing, sometimes they would slap your hands, or hit you with a ruler, or pinch your cheek.\u201d</p> <p>During the 1940s, HSL was already a language in transition, according to Galapin: \u201cThey weren\u2019t using the old [HSL] sign for \u2018mother\u2019, they were using this [ASL] one, but they were still using the old sign for \u2018father\u2019.\u201d Starting in 1939, a few charismatic teachers from the mainland played a vital role in overturning oralism and legitimising sign language, but they ended up promoting ASL over HSL in the process.</p> <p>Employment, education and access to government services \u2013 from court interpreters to mental health provision in sign language \u2013 were perennial problems in the community, but many deaf Hawaiians thrived as master carpenters, printers, mechanics, postal workers and even ukulele makers. As elsewhere, an informal Deaf Club was at the centre of an unusually tightknit community, organising Christmas parties, bowling nights and an annual summer camp-out on the beach, with up to 100 people fishing and cooking for two weeks straight.</p> <p>Yet Hilda Lopez, like many Deaf Hawaiians, left Hawaii for the mainland for education and for work, arriving in California in her teens. The culture shock was intense: \u201cIt was all ASL, and I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with it,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople seemed to know so much, I felt that I wasn\u2019t very smart\u2026. I got confused and I lost HSL, I didn\u2019t really remember it any more.\u201d Only now, haltingly peeling away the layers of ASL, is she starting to reclaim the language.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>No other sign language comes close to having the influence of ASL. Accurate, up-to-date signer numbers do not exist for any sign language, but most of the larger ones are not even yet secure in their own countries. There are more than 20 million deaf people in China, for instance, but <a href=\"https://www.start-american-sign-language.com/chinese-sign-language_html\">Chinese Sign Language</a>, which has hardly been documented, has only been acknowledged as a distinct language for the last 30 years.</p> <p>By comparison, ASL is a powerhouse, supported and promoted by institutions such as the <a href=\"https://nad.org/\">National Association of the Deaf</a>, and <a href=\"http://www2.gallaudet.edu/attend-gallaudet/about-gallaudet/\">Gallaudet University</a> in Washington DC, which describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s only university with programmes and services specifically designed to accommodate deaf and hard of hearing students\u201d. Gallaudet plays a critical role in the American Deaf community and in the life of ASL. Until recently, the university supported both a college prep centre in Honolulu (to ensure qualified deaf applicants to Gallaudet) and ASL interpreter training in Hawaii (to bolster ASL more broadly).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08bcce3976b6d8764054002c9b41493c2535070c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08bcce3976b6d8764054002c9b41493c2535070c/0_29_5311_3187/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Lambrecht and Emily Jo Noschese speaking in Hawaii Sign Language in Honolulu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Lambrecht having a conversation in Hawaii Sign Language, Honolulu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Tanner Photography, LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ASL may now be going global, but the language is at least partly rooted in local sign languages that have long since gone extinct. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French_Sign_Language\">French Sign Language</a> was the first modern, \u201cmethodical\u201d sign language, codified in the 1760s and 70s for formal instruction from existing signs used in the Deaf community of Paris by the <a href=\"http://giving.gallaudet.edu/HOF/pastinductees/the-abbe-charles-michel-de-lepee\">Abb\u00e9 Charles-Michel de l\u2019\u00c9p\u00e9e</a>. When America\u2019s first school for the deaf opened in Hartford, Connecticut in 1817, French Sign Language was imported and likely fused with a handful of existing New England sign languages. The result was ASL. (British Sign Language, dominant in the UK but only granted official status in 2003, is not directly related to ASL.)</p> <p>Today, there are at least 500,000 ASL signers in the US, while ASL and ASL-derived sign languages are also widespread across the Caribbean, the Pacific and much of Africa and south-east Asia. The language\u2019s increasing dominance in countries on every continent reflects the strength of Deaf culture in America and the role that well-meaning American missionaries and educators have played in spreading Deaf education through ASL.</p> <p>In the past, James Woodward told me, missionaries would often tell deaf people in other countries that they didn\u2019t have a language. \u201cIt\u2019s improving now,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I saw that going on as late as 1999 in Thailand, when some Americans came over. I think there\u2019s a growing awareness in the Deaf community in the US of how ASL has really endangered many other sign languages, and even destroyed some.\u201d</p> <p>As with English, prestige plays a major role in the growth of ASL. The linguist Victoria Nyst has written that \u201csigners in West Africa tend to perceive ASL-based sign languages as being superior to sign languages of local origin.\u201d Similarly, Misella Tomita, a young Gallaudet graduate from Hawaii, described visiting the Netherlands and seeing everyone using ASL rather than Dutch Sign Language: \u201cI felt like ASL is taking over the world.\u201d Closer to home, Woodward has studied Black ASL, which seems to have evolved in the second half of the 19th century at segregated deaf schools in the southern US. The dialect, which is an inspiration to Lambrecht, carries a heavy stigma and has become highly endangered. Almost all black signers now use standard ASL.</p> <p>At the Hawaii School for the Deaf and Blind, ASL became the standard in 1960. Today, more than half the teachers are Deaf and students are expected to sign ASL while learning to read and write English. HSL is only used, occasionally, by one dedicated teacher, and Linda\u2019s proposal to teach the language there was turned down.</p> <p>\u201cI think ASL is the reason for the decline of HSL,\u201d Woodward told me matter-of-factly, but then added: \u201cYou can\u2019t really separate the personal issues from the linguistic issues.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The impending disappearance of a language puts enormous stress on a community. For years, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/mexico-language-ayapaneco-dying-out\">last two fluent speakers of Ayapaneco in Mexico</a> were not on speaking terms, until outside pressures and incentives convinced them to reconcile. According to William O\u2019Grady, one language with just 60 speakers has four competing writing systems. In any community that speaks an endangered language, there are often groups who think the language is not worth saving. \u201cBut usually when it\u2019s too late, there\u2019s a deep sense of regret,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.</p> <p>In Hawaii, the remaining community of HSL signers is deeply divided. Lambrecht is the face of the language, but as a past president of the Aloha State Association of the Deaf (ASAD), she is on the opposite \u201cside\u201d from many of the older signers, who belong to a group known as the Diamond Head School Alumni (after the former name of the deaf school).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The impending disappearance of a language puts stress on a community. The remaining HSL speakers are deeply divided</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The two organisations are the institutional expression of a seemingly intractable split in the Deaf community that dates back to at least the 1970s. Some explain it as generational, historical and linguistic, but it is also personal, visceral and mysteriously self-perpetuating. In 2014, when the deaf school marked its 100th anniversary, there were two separate celebrations: one for the Diamond Head group, one for the group Lambrecht is a part of. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just natural now, this fighting,\u201d Lopez told me.</p> <p>Because HSL was in retreat by the 1950s, most younger Deaf people can hardly sign in the language \u2013 there was virtually nowhere for them to pick it up. Many take great pride in their identity as Deaf Hawaiians and emphatically support HSL as a symbol of that identity. But some of the most fluent of the older HSL signers, in the Diamond Head group, are deeply ambivalent about reviving the language. \u201cEven though they use it in their conversations, they don\u2019t feel that HSL is a real language,\u201d said Darlene Ewan, a community activist who teaches at the deaf school.</p> <p>Early on, Wanda Andrew, who is part of the Diamond Head group, warned off the researchers: \u201cI said, \u2018To tell you the truth, for HSL it\u2019s too late, it\u2019s dead,\u2019\u201d she told me. \u201cThe loss of HSL is sad, but it was just sort of a mixture of everything, like chop suey, just kind of like an accent.\u201d For Andrew, who is in her 70s, ASL enabled a cosmopolitan life, from studies at Gallaudet to decades on the mainland and eventual marriage to a Deaf Australian man.</p> <p>Explaining why some keep their distance from the project, Andrew added that \u201cPeople will just say they don\u2019t want to, because they don\u2019t want to work with Linda.\u201d She continued, \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t remember [signs], then they just don\u2019t remember [them]. Or they might be afraid of what it\u2019s for, or they don\u2019t want to feel dumb\u2026 I don\u2019t support Linda, I think she\u2019s a little narcissistic.\u201d</p> <p>Others close to the Diamond Head group agreed that personal animosity and questions of authority \u2013 whose signs to record and revitalise? \u2013 are part of the problem. Lambrecht\u2019s supporters counter that she has almost single-handedly led the revitalisation effort. Lambrecht herself points to the lingering power of the stigma: \u201cHSL is in their hearts, but they\u2019re resistant. They want to be modern.\u201d</p> <p>The divide, which has implications for how the language is documented, is now reflected in a similar rift between the researchers. Earth and Woodward now acknowledge that ASL must have had a deeper impact than was initially understood, obliterating HSL and leaving in its place a hybrid of ASL and HSL that Woodward calls CHSL (Creolised HSL).</p> <p>Earth believes that when signers refer to HSL today, they may actually mean CHSL \u2013 a view Woodward does not share.After meeting more members of the Diamond Head group, Earth argues that CHSL is the only thing left: \u201cI have never seen pure HSL. Fewer and fewer old folks retain strong HSL elements\u2026 They cannot recover pure HSL because they never knew it.\u201d Woodward counters that \u201cthe past two years have shown that Lambrecht is using a different language from CHSL\u201d \u2013 during recording sessions where Earth, increasingly estranged from the project, was not present.</p> <p>The signs for \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cyellow\u201d have become a particular flashpoint in this dispute. Woodward argues that Lambrecht\u2019s distinctive signs for these colour terms make semantic sense, because they are clearly related to the HSL signs for \u201cwater\u201d, \u201cbamboo\u201d and \u201cpineapple\u201d. But other signers were incredulous, saying they had never seen the signs before and suggesting that they might be specific to Lambrecht or her family. Their own signs for those colours were basically ASL, and they couldn\u2019t remember any others that might be original to HSL. Earth felt that the pressure to find such \u201coriginal\u201d non-ASL signs risked distorting the research.</p> <p>\u201cIf no other person has a sign and Linda has a sign, I don\u2019t know what else to do except use her sign,\u201d said Woodward, who worked with the last known signer of Chiang Mai Sign Language in northern Thailand before he died of complications from diabetes in early 2015. Lambrecht\u2019s signs for \u201cblue\u201d, \u201cgreen\u201d, and \u201cyellow\u201d are likely to be the standard for teaching HSL going forward. \u201cIf there\u2019s only one person left,\u201d Woodward said, \u201cthen that\u2019s what you have to document.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Now in its final month, the three-year project to document and revitalise HSL has made progress, but the hardest work remains ahead. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to do everything we wanted,\u201d Woodward told me recently. He is applying to the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme for a six-month grant extension. Even now, he said, the team is still finding new signs.</p> <p>While she continues her work with Woodward, Lambrecht is looking beyond Hawaii, since ASL is spreading to other islands across the Pacific: \u201cI want to tell people there: it\u2019s not that you\u2019re stuck with your local sign language, you can borrow signs from ASL, but please don\u2019t throw out your local language.\u201d Woodward believes that many of the Pacific\u2019s innumerable islands had, or may still have, traditional, indigenous sign languages of their own \u2013 he has already identified one on Majuro, one of the Marshall Islands.</p> <p>\u201cTime is passing quickly,\u201d Lambrecht said the last time I talked to her. The oldest signer who had joined the project, a Japanese-Hawaiian woman named Mildred, was dying. \u201cI remember Mildred would always tell me, \u2018I don\u2019t like HSL, I like ASL, it\u2019s for educated people like me,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018No, no, no, it\u2019s our local language!\u2019\u201d Mildred was seen as one of HSL\u2019s remaining masters, but she had been reluctant to sign for the camera when I visited last year.</p> <p>Then in February, Linda told me, Mildred had a bad fall and went to the hospital. She couldn\u2019t walk and was now under hospice care, living with her son. Linda visited her recently: \u201cI saw her signing \u2013 and I noticed that she had reverted to HSL. We were just shocked. The others didn\u2019t understand her, I said let me translate. Now when I visit her I try to catch every story I can, while she\u2019s still here. Next time I go I really want to bring the camera and record her.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>"
