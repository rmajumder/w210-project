  "<p>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho believes the Premier League title race will be tight all season and may end in a three-way battle.</p> <p>The Portuguese takes Manchester United to Chelsea on Sunday with his side in seventh place on 14 points, five behind Manchester City, the leaders. Antonio Conte\u2019s team are two points and two places better off than United. Asked how important beating Chelsea is for his side\u2019s championship prospects, Mourinho said: \u201cYou look to the table and the distances are so short. It looks like the team that wins three matches in a row is immediately in the top three or four. And the team that has a bad run for a couple of results, just a couple, goes immediately outside the top four. It looks like it is going to be tight.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in a period where some teams are having easier fixtures. If they win two or three of those easy fixtures and the other ones are playing between them, they share points, like what happened at Liverpool [United drew 0-0] and Tottenham against Liverpool.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/21/jose-mourinho-roman-abramovich-chelsea-friends\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho on Roman Abramovich: \u2018We were never friends\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy feeling is it will be close and probably one team that you think is playing for the title in March, probably in May doesn\u2019t finish in the top four.\u201d</p> <p>City lead Arsenal only on goal difference, with Spurs in third a point back, and Liverpool in fourth place, a further point behind.</p> <p>Mourinho believes the number of championship contenders will slim down. \u201cProbably not six, probably three,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably during the run somebody will fall a little bit. I am not a gambler but, if I was, I wouldn\u2019t bet a lot on the title or top four because there is a big risk of losing money.\u201d</p> <p>The 53-year-old trod carefully when pressed for his view of how Conte has started at Chelsea. \u201cI don\u2019t have to analyse their start to the season but, when you look at the table and you see where they are, it cannot be bad,\u201d Mourinho said, before brushing off the return to his former club. \u201cI knew that working in England, staying in the Premier League, I would sooner or later have to play against Chelsea and I would have to go to Stamford Bridge. The computer has decided that I have to go now, so we go.\u201d</p> <p>Jesse Lingard pointed to United\u2019s unbeaten run of five games as reason for optimism going into the game at Stamford Bridge. \u201cI think our confidence is very high now and we\u2019ll now prepare for the big game on Sunday,\u201d he said, before recalling his strike in the 1-1 draw at Chelsea in last season\u2019s corresponding fixture, which was voted goal of the month for February.</p> <p>\u201cI enjoyed it last time when I was there and it was nice to be on the scoresheet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe drew, though, so hopefully we can get the win this time. We know it\u2019s going to be a tough game against Chelsea but we are mentally prepared for that. We have the confidence now to go on and win every game. Goals and assists are especially key for me this season, so I need to kick on now.\u201d</p> <p>Lingard scored in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/20/jose-mourinho-rounds-on-einsteins-paul-pogba\">United\u2019s 4-1 victory over Fenerbahce</a> on Thursday night at Old Trafford and the forward is content with the manager allowing his attackers more freedom. \u201cThe front four players had the licence to go on and play and there was a lot of chopping and changing of positions which I think kept their defenders on their toes,\u201d said Lingard of the win over the Turkish side.</p>",

He defies Bridger, the corporatist mobster, and persuades him to finance the plot from his prison cell \u2013 think Tory Eurosceptic triumph over Ken Clarke-ite centrists. Vote Leave HQ pre-23 June was brimful of Charlies, all inveterate tilters at authority. If its campaign duo, Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, are not somewhere in the English mob when my follow-up, The Brexit Job, is released, it will be a sore casting omission.</p> <p>So many aspects of the original chime again today. Bridger (No\u00ebl Coward slumming it) would have loved May-ite industrial policies, fretting as he does about balance of payments headaches and the \u201clazy, unimaginative management \u2026 driving this country on the rocks\u201d. The economic angst and currency underperformance that dogged Harold Wilson\u2019s government in the late 1960s are back to haunt the Treasury in 2016.</p> <p>As a snapshot of economic fortunes, the movie is hard to beat. The northern Italy of the 1960s was motoring away very nicely, thanks to <a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracolo_economico_italiano\"><em>il miracolo economico</em></a>: a Germany-with-sun, as far as deficit-ridden Brits were concerned. Here, sterling crises arrived with horrible regularity: three between 1968 and 1969.

  "<p>Police are investigating an allegation against the BBC of incitement to racial hatred after a bodybuilder with a muscle fixation complained that a documentary about his life was racist.</p> <p>The BBC3 film, The Man Who Squeezes Muscles: Searching for Purple Aki, presented itself as an investigation into how Akinwale Arobieke, 55, has been portrayed as a bogeyman terrifying north-west England. An article on the BBC website that appears alongside the film states: \u201cThe nickname itself was racially charged \u2013 the suggestion being he was \u201cso black he\u2019s purple\u201d.</p> <p>Arobieke complained to Merseyside police that the documentary was racist and demonised him.</p> <p>Arobieke, a 6ft 5ins bodybuilder, has a series of convictions relating to the harassment of young men. He is known for approaching younger men and striking up conversations about weight training, before touching and measuring their muscles, and then inviting them to squat his body weight.</p> <p>In 1986, Arobieke was convicted of manslaughter after 16-year-old Gary Kelly was electrocuted at New Brighton railway station, allegedly while running away from him. But there was no evidence that he had threatened or touched Kelly. The conviction was later overturned, and Arobieke was awarded an estimated \u00a335,000 in compensation due to alleged racial overtones in the prosecution case.</p> <p>The BBC3 film, available online and first broadcast in September, starts: \u201cPurple Aki, a name that\u2019s whispered in the parks and playgrounds of Merseyside \u2026 a threat made to kids \u2026 watch out or Purple Aki will get you.\u201d In the film he is referred as as a \u201cbig black\u201d man three times, and it is said that \u201ceveryone has seen him or been chased by him\u201d and \u201ceveryone thinks they have spotted him and felt a shiver\u201d. One alleged victim says \u201cHe is just purple and huge.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Merseyside police said: \u201cOfficers from the Liverpool Sigma team are investigating an allegation of a race hate crime. This follows the release of a BBC3 documentary. Specialist detectives are working alongside partners in the Crown Prosecution Service and at this time the investigation is ongoing.\u201d</p> <p>Arobieke told the Guardian that the film was racist and failed to point out that he has never been convicted of a sexual offence and that he was compensated after his conviction for manslaughter was overturned.</p> <p>In 2001, he was cleared of 50 counts of indecent assault and harassment against 14 teenage boys between 1995 and 2000. But he was later sentenced to 30 months in jail for making threats to kill. Arobieke was imprisoned for a further six years in 2003 following his guilty pleas to 15 counts of harassment and one count of witness harassment.</p> <p>After he was released in 2006, Merseyside police successfully applied to Liverpool magistrates court for a sexual offences prevention order (Sopo) against Arobieke, banning him from touching, feeling or measuring muscles; asking people to do squat exercises in public; entering the towns of St Helens, Warrington or Widnes without police permission; and loitering near schools, gyms or sports clubs.</p> <p>But in May the order was overturned after Arobieke, representing himself at Manchester crown court, argued that the Sopo was draconian and that his behaviour was neither criminal nor sexual. Judge Richard Mansell QC said the restrictions it placed on his \u201cfreedoms\u201d could no longer be justified. Lifting the order would allow him to pursue his interest in an \u201cappropriate venue\u201d, the judge said, such as a gym or a bodybuilding event.</p> <p>\u201cThe ban on touching muscles is just not on,\u201d the judge said. \u201cI\u2019m not into bodybuilding myself, but I\u2019d have thought men who have muscles in their arms the diameter of my leg are the sort of men who will admire each other\u2019s bodies.\u201d</p> <p>Arobieke vowed to reinvent himself, telling the judge: \u201cFrom today I\u2019m going to conduct myself properly \u2026 I\u2019m not going to run around touching everybody\u2019s muscles because there\u2019s no need for that.\u201d</p> <p>Arobieke told the Guardian that he has asked the Criminal Cases Review Commission to review his conviction for threats to kill. The CCRC confirmed it had received an application from Arobieke to have his conviction reviewed.</p> <p>The BBC has been approached for comment.<br></p>",

  "<p>You always know an election is near in the US when Democrats and Republicans start to discuss the plight of black Americans. </p> <p>Most of the time, little is said about the high levels of poverty in black communities.

There was also the video-recorded killing of unarmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/30/terence-crutcher-shooting-not-guilty-plea-betty-shelby\">Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>. </p> <p>Even where police killings of black men and boys do not receive national attention, they reverberate within the neighborhoods and wider communities for days, weeks and months afterward. Indeed, the crisis of police violence was identified by black millennials as their number one concern above all other issues. In a <a href=\"http://blackyouthproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BYP-millenials-report-10-27-15-FINAL.pdf\">poll</a> taken last August, 91% of black and 71% of Latino millennials described \u201cpolice killing of Black people as a serious problem\u201d. Seventy-seven per cent of black millennials said that they or someone they knew had been \u201charassed\u201d by the police. </p> <p>The Democratic party has appeared completely incapable of putting a stop to it.</p> <p>It has now been 19 months since Obama\u2019s commission on policing in the 21st century released its report and offered 58 recommendations for reform. The police have killed more than 1,000 people in that time. Furthermore, for all the publicity that some cases have received, it is more likely than not that the police officers will not even be charged, let alone punished. </p> <p>In the absence of actual reform, Democrats led by Obama seem to stress the need for understanding on both sides \u2013 as if police violence were the product of misunderstanding as opposed to oppression at the hands of an armed appendage of the state. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton\u2019s platform is more substantive than that, as she calls for spending a billion dollars to better train police, legislation against racial profiling and dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. While one can debate Clinton\u2019s ability to actually follow through on these promises (and whether they would actually produce the kind of accountability the Black Lives Matter movement is demanding), the bigger problem for Clinton is one of credibility. </p> <p>Supporters of Clinton have denounced the perception of her as untrustworthy, calling it ignorance or sexism. It is undeniable that some of the vitriol directed at Clinton has misogynistic undertones, especially when it comes from Trump and his supporters. But to reduce all criticism of Clinton to gender discrimination is both disingenuous and dishonest. </p> <h2>America\u2019s \u2018first black president\u2019?

What has been left out of the happy tale is the way Clinton used poor and working-class black people as political grist to rebuild an electoral coalition of old Reagan Democrats and moderate white Republicans. </p> <p>In 1993, Bill Clinton went to the church where Martin Luther King Jr delivered his last speech before his assassination. Clinton <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/excerpts-from-clinton-s-speech-to-black-ministers.html?pagewanted=allhttp://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/excerpts-from-clinton-s-speech-to-black-ministers.html?pagewanted=allhttp://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/14/us/excerpts-from-clinton-s-speech-to-black-ministers.html?pagewanted=all\">said</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[King] would say, \u201cYou did a good job creating a black middle class of people who really are doing well \u2026 You did a good job. You did a good job in opening opportunity.\u201d But he would [also] say, \u201cI fought for freedom \u2026 but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandonment, not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them, as if they don\u2019t amount to anything. I fought to stop white people from being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandonment.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton had perfected the southern cadence \u2013 in this case, literally speaking as if he were Martin Luther King Jr \u2013 that intimated an insider\u2019s perspective on black life, while clearly communicating to white voters a rejection of the \u201csystemic racism\u201d which Hillary Clinton speaks so much about today. </p> <p>(Of course, these were the words of Bill and not Hillary \u2013 but the painful efforts to parse out where her politics begin and his end are specious. Aside from the fact that Hillary\u2019s comments about \u201csuper predators\u201d aped the sentiment at the core of Bill\u2019s law and order agenda, we can\u2019t ignore how she has cast her years in the White House as part of her vast political experience that makes her more prepared than anyone else to be president.)</p> <p>This skilled blame game continued throughout Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, during which the Democratic party as a whole helped to structure the wider context within which the discussions about crime and welfare reform were taking place. </p> <p>For example, in the aftermath of the Los Angeles Rebellion in 1992, the then candidate Bill Clinton traveled to South Central Los Angeles and diagnosed the roots of the crisis. He <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-03/news/mn-1956_1_los-angeles\">said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p> \u201cPeople \u2026 are looting because they are not part of the system at all any more. They do not share our values, and their children are growing up in a culture alien from ours, without family, without neighborhood, without church, without support.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>As a result, Clinton and the Democratic party of the 1990s played a pivotal role in helping to shift the discussion <em>away</em> from \u201csystemic racism\u201d, as it had been in the 1960s and 1970s, back to a focus on the culture and family structure of African Americans as the root of black inequality. Bill Clinton and his political partner, Hillary, were not passive observers of an ideological attack that posited crime and punishment over government assistance and public welfare; they, in the 1990s context, were its architects. </p> <h2>\u2018Free stuff\u2019 and the anti-capitalist politics Hillary won\u2019t touch </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e838388000f4c20912f60b4dfcaa8cbefc1c83b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e838388000f4c20912f60b4dfcaa8cbefc1c83b/901_162_1463_878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"bernie sanders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Young black voters were most attuned to Sanders\u2019 redistributive political agenda.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second problem the Clinton campaign faces is the developing anti-capitalist politics of young voters, especially black millennials. </p> <p>Though Clinton supporters chastised Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign for its poor showing among African Americans, what went without much comment is how well the Sanders campaign did among young black voters. In fact, 44% of black voters aged 18 to 30 voted for Sanders, compared with the 32% of votes that went to Clinton. Sanders, by <a href=\"http://genforwardsurvey.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/GenForwardAugust2016Toplines_final-1.pdf\">comparison</a>, received only 33% of the white youth vote. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, Sanders\u2019 campaign began with little attention paid to racial inequality, but that slowly shifted over its course. Nevertheless, young black voters were most attuned to Sanders\u2019 redistributive political agenda. Polling found that \u201cpoverty and inequality\u201d together were listed as the third most important issue for black millennials. </p> <p>This fits with the growing anti-capitalist sentiment among young people today. According to a Harvard University poll of young adults from ages 18 to 29, 51% said they <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/26/a-majority-of-millennials-now-reject-capitalism-poll-shows/\">did not support capitalism</a>; conversely, 33% said they supported socialism. This is a political awakening that has been developing over the last several years. In the year that the Occupy movement announced its arrival in 2011, a Pew poll found 47% of young people did not support capitalism. </p> <p>Today, that sentiment is deeper than just an anti-capitalist feeling: it is also expressed positively and in support for redistributive social programs. Forty-eight per cent of millennials support health insurance as a \u201cright for all people\u201d. And 47% agree that basic necessities, such as food and shelter, are \u201ca right that the government should provide to those unable to afford them\u201d. Clinton mocked Sanders supporters during the primary fight for wanting \u201cfree stuff\u201d.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-supporters-audio-leak-228997\">leak</a> of remarks Clinton made during a February fundraiser demonstrates her grasp of at least some of the reluctance of millennials to embrace her candidacy: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And on the other side, there\u2019s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we\u2019ve done hasn\u2019t gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don\u2019t know what that means, but it\u2019s something that they deeply feel. Some are new to politics completely. They\u2019re children of the great recession. And they are living in their parents\u2019 basement \u2026 They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don\u2019t see much of a future \u2026 If you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn\u2019t pay a lot, and doesn\u2019t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. </p> </blockquote> <p>For whatever insights Clinton may demonstrate here, there is also a kind of smug undercurrent that links newness to politics with the \u201cnaive\u201d desire for \u201cfree healthcare\u201d and \u201cfree college\u201d. </p> <p>Months later, after a bruising primary with Bernie Sanders, Clinton now supports some aspects of \u201cfree college\u201d. This sudden switch, in addition to contributing to the perception that Clinton will say anything to curry political favor, speaks to the larger disconnect between her campaign and young voters. Young people wonder how it is that a wealthy nation like the US with its 400 billionaires can also be home to 45 million people living in poverty. The young people, like those of the Occupy movement and Black Lives Matter, care less about what is politically realistic and more about what is just. </p> <p>This concern expressed by millennials is not just altruistic, but it is deeply personal. </p> <p>For some black millennials, their lives teeter on the edge of catastrophe. There is breathless reporting of gun violence in Chicago, but outside of the city there is remarkably little said about the conditions within which the violence gestates. Forty-seven per cent of 20- to 24-year-old young black men are unemployed. Among black 16- to 19-year-olds, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-youth-unemployment-urban-league-0126-biz-20160124-story.html\">14%</a> are neither working nor in school. </p> <h2>Candidate Obama was no President Obama</h2> <p>Finally, the main factor in black millennials\u2019 shortage of enthusiasm for Clinton may be the thin portfolio of reform offered by Barack Obama. </p> <p>Obama won in 2008 and 2012 in part because of the historic turnout of young black voters. This was the generation that had politically come of age during the endless wars of the Bush administration; it had witnessed the collective shrug of the federal government in response to the catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina. Black youths also watched as their families were the canaries in the mine shaft of the pending economic meltdown in 2008. The ensuing wave of home foreclosures began to take effect in black communities in 2006 and 2007. </p> <p>This was the context of Obama\u2019s run against Bush in 2008, when Obama jettisoned the cookie-cutter political campaign. </p> <p>He righteously counseled: \u201cChange doesn\u2019t come from Washington \u2026 change comes to Washington.\u201d While on the campaign trail, he made speeches that invoked the legacy of the abolitionist movement against slavery, the labor movement of the 1930s that made unions possible, the gay rights movement and, of course, the civil rights movement. Obama rhetorically tried to situate his campaign among those social movements: underdogs in the grassroots doing the impossible for the good of the nation. </p> <p>But candidate Obama was no President Obama, who quickly distanced himself from the loftiness of his campaign. The rise of Black Lives Matter is, in no small part, a product of his inability or unwillingness to directly and forthrightly address the persistence of racial inequality. The paralysis of the president in the face of racism and injustice was a bitter pill to swallow. </p> <p>Obama has reminded all who would listen that he was not the president of black America, but the president of the US. Even if this disappointment was never measured in opinion polls, today it can be measured in the waning interest of black millennials in the Clinton campaign. It can even be detected in the terse words of Obama, who recently said it would be a \u201cpersonal insult\u201d to him if black voters did not mobilize in big numbers to elect Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>But perhaps it is most clearly borne out in the anger of black millennials, as exemplified in this <a href=\"http://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2014/12/01/dear-mr-president-a-letter-from-tef-poe?page=2\">letter</a> from the St Louis artist and poet Tef Poe, written at the height of the Ferguson uprising:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When an assault rifle is aimed at your face over nothing more than a refusal to move, you don\u2019t feel like the American experience is one that includes you. When the president your generation selected does not condemn these attacks, you suddenly begin to believe that this system is a fraudulent hoax \u2013 and the joke is on you. Racism is very much alive in America, but as a president with so much melanin in his skin, you seem to address it very bashfully \u2026 Now we are organizing against you and members of your party as though we didn\u2019t vote for you to begin with. This saddens me, because we rooted for you. Me and my friends are young. We voted for you because initially you spoke our language. We believed you would be more of an activist than a typical suit-and-tie teleprompter politician. Are you not outraged by the treatment of your own people by law enforcement? Why is it so difficult for you to display a moment of honesty and reflection to the public about your own blackness? </p> </blockquote> <p>If the nation\u2019s first black president, who won a majority of the electorate and came into office with a super-majority in Congress, could not disrupt the racial status quo, then what can anyone expect Clinton to accomplish?</p> <h2>\u2018If things get worse\u2019 isn\u2019t a good political choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8f034330ce33113dcb7f37beb5f348b1b04b2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8f034330ce33113dcb7f37beb5f348b1b04b2e4/9_0_2995_1797/1000.jpg\" alt=\"hillary clinton donald trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The myopic focus on Donald Trump\u2019s rightwing and racist rhetoric cannot, in and of itself, undo the sense of disappointment and cynicism black millennials feel toward the Democratic party.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last May, Clinton <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/06/02/transcript-hillary-clinton-delivers-major-national-security-address/\">said in a foreign policy speech</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that America isn\u2019t great.
