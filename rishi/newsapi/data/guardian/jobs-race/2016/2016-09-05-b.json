  "<p>Human rights and equality campaigners are demanding an investigation into the decision to give the contract to run a discrimination helpline to G4S, the scandal-hit global security firm.</p> <p>A number of organisations, including Liberty, Tell Mama and Inquest, have written to Harriet Harman, the chair of the joint committee on human rights, and Maria Miller, the chair of the women and equalities select committee, to express \u201cprofound concern\u201d over the awarding of the contract to run the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) to G4S. <br></p> <p>They want the contract, due to begin on 1 October, to be halted until an inquiry is held into both the tendering process and the suitability of G4S to deliver the service properly. They claim that G4S is \u201cmanifestly ill-equipped to provide advice on discrimination and human rights\u201d and that the public would be unlikely to have confidence in it. </p> <p>The Law Centres Network, which represents 40 law centres in the UK and is one of the signatories to the letter, has begun a legal challenge to the tendering process and the awarding of the contract. The charity, which provides free legal advice to people on low incomes, accused the government of failing to properly assess the shortcomings of the EASS with stakeholders and said that it did not properly consider how to reform the service with the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which ran it previously.</p> <p>In March, a House of Lords committee recommended that the government restore the helpline to the EHRC. A number of stakeholders told the committee that the decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/03/a4e-major-government-contract\">outsource the service</a> had led to a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between disabled people and the body charged with advancing equality and human rights. When run by EHRC, it highlighted trends and issues important to them, they said. The matter is scheduled for debate in the House of Lords on Tuesday.</p> <p>The letter, sent on 5 September and <a href=\"https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/sites/default/files/Joint%20NGO%20letter%20to%20Parliament%20re%20G4S%20EASS%20contract%20Final.pdf\">signed by 41 organisations</a>, said the tendering process was flawed, \u201clacked openness\u201d, and did not require a contractor to have any relevant knowledge or prior skills in delivering equalities or human rights advice. It questioned the appointment of G4S, which it said had \u201cearned a reputation for serious systemic mismanagement and discrimination\u201d and was responsible for human rights violations against those in its care. It highlighted concerns expressed by many MPs over the competence of the security company and included a dossier of serious allegations and findings against G4S.</p> <p>\u201cThese include systemic failings \u2026 the repeated findings of racism and sexism among G4S staff, and harrowing official reports of G4S mistreatment of children, pregnant women and other protected groups,\u201d the letter said.</p> <p>The company most recently came under renewed scrutiny over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/moj-to-take-over-medway-child-jail-from-g4s\">its running of Medway youth jail</a>, which resulted in the government taking over the jail\u2019s management.</p> <p>The decision to award the contract to G4S has been criticised by union leaders, and a <a href=\"https://actions.sumofus.org/a/don-t-hand-the-government-s-discrimination-helpline-over-to-g4s\">petition by campaigning platform SumOfUs</a>, urging Justine Greening, the secretary of state for education, women and equalities not to give the contract to G4S but instead to give responsibility back to the EHRC, has received more than 53,000 signatures.</p> <p> Bella Sankey, director of policy at Liberty, said: \u201cThe EASS provides expert advice to those who face discrimination \u2013 whether refused accommodation because of their race, or sacked from their job because of their age. <br></p> <p>\u201cG4S has been responsible for countless human rights violations and the mistreatment \u2026 of people in their care. It\u2019s hard to think of a company more ill-equipped to provide this vital service. Liberty joins other equality and rights organisations in demanding that this perverse decision be halted while parliament investigates.\u201d</p> <p>Nimrod Ben-Cnaan, head of policy at the Law Centres Network, said: \u201cThis legal action is about ensuring access to justice for some of the most disadvantaged and often vulnerable people in society. It is already difficult for people to access appropriate advice on discrimination and human rights, which are complex areas of law. Our concern is that the government does all it should to ensure that the most suitable provider is chosen, and that the service is effective.\u201d</p> <p>Sondhya Gupta, senior campaigner with SomeOfUs.org, described the decision to award the contract to G4S as a \u201ckick in the teeth to everyone who faces disability, race, or sex discrimination\u201d. She added: \u201cWith hate crimes and discrimination on the rise in post-Brexit Britain, the kind of support that the EASS provides is now more important than ever.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>A spokesman for the EHRC said: \u201cWe think the commission should have been given responsibility for running the service, and that remains our position. However, given that the contract has already been awarded, we are working with G4S and government to provide advice on how the service can best meet the needs of those who experience discrimination or an abuse of their human rights.\u201d</p> <p>Maria Miller said: \u201cWe are aware of the concerns that have been raised on this subject and will consider the matter carefully.\u201d </p> <p>A spokesperson for the government said: \u201cThe Equality Advisory and Support Service is an important source of free advice and support for people facing discrimination or human rights issues. To ensure the service can continue and is run as effectively and efficiently as possible, we ran an open and competitive tender process to identify who is best to take it forward. Following this, G4S has been successful, and it will be running the service for three years from October 2016.\u201d</p> <p>Neil Malpas, the managing director responsible at G4S for this service, said the company would bring experience gleaned from its work at the DWP helpline for separating parents. \u201cWe were awarded the contract on the strength of our work handling other complex call centres including the Department for Work and Pensions\u2019 (DWP) child maintenance options service,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have supported that helpline for separating parents over the past three years and feedback from callers and the DWP has been positive.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Growing up in Hampton, Virginia, Margot Lee Shetterly was surrounded by brilliant female scientists and mathematicians who, like her father, worked for Nasa. \u201cI would see them in the context of community organisations or church, or you\u2019d run into them at the grocery store \u2013 they were my parents\u2019 friends,\u201d she says. It didn\u2019t seem unusual to her that, within her community, so many women had enjoyed long careers at Langley, Nasa\u2019s research centre \u2013 and so many of them were black women. It was her husband, on a trip back to visit Lee Shetterly\u2019s parents, who pointed out how remarkable it was.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/14/nasa-black-women-hidden-figures-margot-lee-shetterly\">Nasa's black women boffins get big-screen countdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1940, she points out in her book, Hidden Figures, just 2% of black women got a university degree and more than half became teachers.

Women were barred from studying at many colleges. If you are not able to read and write, then you are not going to be able to tell your own story.

She had been a talented maths student, and became a teacher. By the time she applied to Langley, she was married with four children. Vaughan joined a small group of other black female mathematicians, who would become known as the West Computers, segregated from their white counterparts. It was the same elsewhere \u2013 black employees were barred from the white employees\u2019 bathroom, and in the canteen a sign on one of the tables read \u201ccoloured computers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cToday it seems absolutely unthinkable and yet back then it was very normal,\u201d says Lee Shetterly. \u201cIn every aspect of their lives, these women had to face the segregation that pervaded their lives. It made total sense in that context that it also governed their lives at work, and yet obviously people never stopped trying to find a way to break those chains.\u201d The women kept removing the sign on the table, but it was always replaced.

As for a management role, the highest a black woman could reach at that time was heading the West Computers\u2019 office \u2013 in 1951 Vaughan was made head of the unit, becoming Langley\u2019s first black manager.</p> <p>Like Vaughan, Mary Jackson became a teacher first \u2013 she had a degree in maths and physics \u2013 but, returning to her home town of Hampton, she worked as a secretary. She left when she became a mother. A few years later, she became a military secretary but, in 1951, Langley offered her a job as a computer. Two years later, Jackson was working with the engineering team working on the supersonic pressure tunnel, where they tested models. Soon after that, she was training to become an engineer \u2013 after humiliatingly having to apply for special permission, she started taking classes at a whites-only school.</p> <p>Around the same time, <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/feature/katherine-johnson-the-girl-who-loved-to-count\">Johnson</a> started at Langley. Another former teacher, she started as a computer but soon joined the thrusting flight research division. She was brilliant and confident \u2013 she refused to use the \u201ccoloured\u201d bathrooms, through sheer force of will she got into meetings she was barred from, and put herself forward for work. Her first research report, on orbital flight, was also the first flight research division report written by a woman. She calculated the trajectories of Nasa\u2019s first human space flights, and her work was crucial to the Apollo moon landing. Now 98, Johnson spent decades after her retirement visiting schools and giving talks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a75b840c0c60692bebdc6b0db14c4b295c46afb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a75b840c0c60692bebdc6b0db14c4b295c46afb0/0_0_2000_1076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The West Computers, in Hidden Figures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"538\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The West Computers, in Hidden Figures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 2016 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey never stopped trying to find ways, large and small, to expand the space for themselves and the people who came after them,\u201d says Lee Shetterly. \u201cI think all of these women had a great sense that if they were to succeed in these jobs, they would increase the chance that another black woman would be hired and would be perceived as being capable of that work. That was a responsibility they felt.\u201d</p> <p>Christine Darden had fallen in love with geometry at high school, but her father insisted she train as a teacher after her masters in applied mathematics. \u201cJobs for black women \u2013 I finished high school in 1958 \u2013 were not plentiful at that time.

She wanted to become an engineer but watched as men were promoted ahead of her. Darden confronted the division chief and asked why men who had the same education and experience as her \u2013 and often less \u2013 were promoted while she was not. \u201cHis answer was that the women had never complained about it before,\u201d remembers Darden. There was the belief that women would give up work as soon as they had children. \u201cYou would find that, for the most part, that was not true for a lot of black women who, once they went to work, had to continue to work.\u201d</p> <p>Darden argued her case, and was almost instantly promoted to an engineering team where she started her career in sonic boom research. She would later complete a doctorate in mechanical engineering, but her early work provided some of the fundamentals in sonic boom reduction technology. During the course of her 40-year career at Nasa, Darden became one of the world\u2019s leading experts in this area.</p> <p>She had started her Nasa career in the computer pool in 1967 (it had been desegregated by then), and she knew several women who had been in that first cohort of West Computers. \u201cI knew that I stood on their shoulders and was able to do some things because of what they had done,\u201d says Darden. \u201cAnd I like to think that some of the younger ones might have stood on my shoulders, too.\u201d</p>",

To their jaundiced eyes, this means you have bought a suit off the peg, and cannot afford six grand to have one made that immobilises you at the armpits and makes your bum look like that of a figure skater.</p> <p>The haircut has to be bouffant. One of the surest signs you have walked into a workplace that recruits only from the elite is that the haircuts do not change. Neat back and sides, big bouffant quiff, no gel, no wax, no putty. These are the marks of convicts or advertising men, not the front-office banker.</p> <p>All this is fakeable, with money, practice, a willing tailor and obedient hair. But then you need to open your mouth to speak.</p> <p>Take careful note of what\u2019s happening to the \u201cposh\u201d English accent. It is no longer enough to have the calm, fruitily inflected RP common among barristers.

You must have, at the very least, discovered a new species in the Amazon while in the lower sixth, or still better, a new tribe. You must have proof of this on Facebook and Instagram. Also references from Nobel prize-winning economists.</p> <p>Fortunately, it\u2019s all fakeable.</p> <p>But here comes the unfakeable part. You must go into that interview not just with a tie from Ede &amp; Ravenscroft and shoes from Lobb.

You\u2019re born into that privilege, but you didn\u2019t do anything to expedite that privilege.\u201d</p> <p>Coss says that in conversations with friends and potential female romantic partners, his experience has sometimes felt disregarded and he has felt misunderstood.</p> <p>\u201cWe talk about accepting people \u2013 that someone didn\u2019t choose to be trans, or gay, so don\u2019t judge me for that either: I didn\u2019t choose to be straight, white and male.\u201d</p> <p>Coss expresses frustration that people seem to be paying attention to gender and race as forms of oppression, something he keeps on being told he doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cIf you want to talk about privilege, I feel class is the big divider, much more than race and gender.\u201d</p> <p>The sense of defeat appears to be shared by others, in other forms. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is a positive thing from a woman\u2019s perspective, from a man\u2019s perspective I don\u2019t know</p> <footer> <cite>Ishwar Chhikara</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI actually <em>feel</em> like women are taking over the world,\u201d says Ishwar Chhikara, a 36-year-old investment officer at an international development bank, citing statistics showing <a href=\"http://blogs.census.gov/2015/10/07/women-now-at-the-head-of-the-class-lead-men-in-college-attainment/?cid=RS23\">more women</a> now have college degrees in the US than men. He says this laughing, but with no audible irony.</p> <p>\u201cI feel bad for men, especially those who don\u2019t go to school, or study. The whole system is changing drastically with the coming of the information age. It\u2019s not about strength anymore, it\u2019s about the brains.\u201d</p> <p>While muscles at the center of an economy made the physically stronger sex have more power, Chhikara isn\u2019t so convinced with the switch-up. </p> <p>\u201cIt is a positive thing from a woman\u2019s perspective, from a man\u2019s perspective I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Like all men interviewed, Chhikara does not deny the historical presence of male privilege. That presence is what makes its loss harder, he says. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of this sense of entitlement. If you are brought up understanding there is an inherent favorable bias towards men, and that is taken away, it isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p> <p>Such a feeling matches up to a number of recent studies done on race and perception in America. <a href=\"http://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/sommerslab/documents/raceInterNortonSommers2011.pdf\">One study from 2011</a> showed that despite still persistently experiencing much better outcomes when it came to income, employment, home ownership and health, white Americans felt that as black Americans had gained in rights over the second half of the 20th century, white Americans had experienced a mirror decrease in rights.</p> <p>This understanding is false \u2013 both when it comes to race and gender \u2013 says Kimmel, the professor of sociology. Gender progress, just like progress towards a more racially equal society, is far from a zero-sum game. Using a \u201crising sea lifts all boats\u201d argument, Kimmel says gender equality is not just fair, just and democratic, it also makes for happier outcomes and lives for women and <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_kimmel_why_gender_equality_is_good_for_everyone_men_included?language=en\">men</a>.</p> <p>Treva Lindsey, a professor at Ohio State University in the department of women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies, says the big question here is: what does it mean to move outside of privilege when privilege is normalized?</p> <p>\u201cThis is a hard unlearning process that has to happen, but feeling silenced and learning how to be quiet is a different thing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lindsey says this is more of a question of learning to create space for other people, and understanding that your thoughts and ideas do not automatically get to be at the center of all conversations.</p> <p>John Acosta, a 31-year-old design student who grew up in what he describes as a small, conservative town, says that as he has traveled and lived in different cities across the US, he has had to learn to repress some of the behaviors he was taught were right, or polite, growing up. </p> <p>\u201cThe way I was brought up, I would give up my seat to women in the subway \u2013 young or old. Now I don\u2019t. I think, OK we are equal. But I still worry. Does she realize that I am not giving her my seat because I think she is as capable as I am of going that one stop?\u201d</p> <p>When he was an installer at a furniture store, he would go out of his way to help his female bosses, but he quickly had to revisit his approach. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The way I was brought up, I would give up my seat to women in the subway \u2013 young or old.

You have to shift your questioning \u2013 and instead of saying \u2018let me help\u2019, you have to say \u2018OK, you\u2019re in charge, what can I do?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jose Oliveras, a 26-year-old bike messenger and independent contractor, says it is hard to know how to talk to or approach women nowadays. Feminism has made him unsure about courting rituals, and driven him to silence. </p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say hello, you can\u2019t compliment, you got to have some prince charming stuff up your sleeve.\u201d</p> <p>Oliveras recounts simply saying \u201cexcuse me\u201d to a woman and being met by a hissing sound through teeth.</p> <p>\u201cWomen aren\u2019t giving it a chance anymore. They are saying I don\u2019t have to do that, make an effort for men. You are removing the men who are trying to create a bond with you. It\u2019s like, OK fine, but it sucks, you know.\u201d</p> <p>This was echoed by Burton Williams, a 35-year-old senior data engineer who says many women still expect men to be chivalrous, carry bags for them and open doors, but others take offense for the exact same behavior, screaming \u201cwoman power\u201d at \u201calmost everything\u201d.</p> <p>It is confusing, and the mixed messaging can leave men feeling portrayed in the wrong way just for trying to do the right thing.</p> <p>\u201cI am all for women empowerment but it\u2019s like they want to empower themselves so much that they want to eliminate men from the equation,\u201d Oliveras says, speculating that women these days are no longer interested in creating intimate ties now that they\u2019re less economically dependent on men.</p> <p>Kimmel, the sociologist, says that the changes that have happened on a gender level within society over the past two generations have been \u201cdizzyingly fast\u201d. </p> <p>Women have entered every single profession, every single arena, provoking changes that have left some men \u201cbewildered\u201d, Kimmel says. </p> <p>The consequence of this is that men sometimes do not see women\u2019s entry into previously male fields as an entry, but rather an \u201cinvasion\u201d, Kimmel says. \u201cIt feels like a loss for men. They feel they are being invaded.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEver since women started to argue for equal rights, men have started to think that this is something against them personally,\u201d he laughs.</p> <p>Coss, the butcher, flags that we should be aspiring to be ending patriarchy and marching towards equality, not creating a new world order of matriarchy.</p> <p>And not making presumptions goes both ways, he states.</p> <p>\u201cI would never say women have it easier in the office place because people will be nice to them, because they do not want to hurt their feelings. I would never presume to know what it\u2019s like to be a woman. That presumption is not shared towards straight white men ... But having that presumption [about straight men] is still a presumption.\u201d </p> <p>Both Lindsey and Kimmel agree there are many parallels to be drawn between these kinds of feelings, and the rhetoric used to enable and justify the political rise of Donald Trump as a presidential candidate (although none of the men interviewed for this article declared themselves to be Trump supporters).</p> <p>\u201cMake America great again\u201d as a slogan clearly recalls the nostalgic loss of some kind of self-proclaimed and self-righteous prestige, highly tied to privilege, and the perceived loss thereof. \u201cI think it is a direct relationship. If you look at the motto \u2018take our country back\u2019 or \u2018make America great again\u2019, that is the very definition of entitlement. The only Americans who can say that are native Americans,\u201d Kimmel says.</p> <p>\u201cWhat exactly has been taken away?\u201d Lindsey asks. \u201cIf you force the articulation of what has been taken away, you will find that some of these answers are very gender and race related.\u201d</p> <p>But it is the other banner so often seen at Trump rallies that resonates even more clearly in this context: \u201cThe silent majority stands with Trump.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they have been very silent,\u201d Lindsey says of Trump supporters.</p>",
  "<p>Prison teachers at the Cessnock correctional complex stopped work for an hour on Monday to protest against the loss of their jobs and the outsourcing of New South Wales prison education to staff without formal teaching degrees. </p> <p>A similar unauthorised stop-work action by staff at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/06/sydneys-long-bay-jail-to-close-when-australias-biggest-prison-built\">the Long Bay correctional centre in Sydney</a> took place on Friday. From February, prisoners in NSW will have most of their education delivered by staff from an external training organisation rather than by university qualified teachers, most of whose positions will be made redundant by December.</p> <p>The number of qualified teachers in prisons will be cut from 152 full-time public teaching positions to 20, with the gap to be filled by about 60 external clerical staff who will not be required to have a degree. Those positions will be put out to tender.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/28/inmates-squeezed-into-nsw-jails-as-prisoner-numbers-hit-record-high\">The corrections minister, David Elliott</a>, announced the plan in May, citing a KPMG review from last year that found the current education model was not meeting demand, or achieving adequate literacy and numeracy outcomes for the prisoners. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/24/indigenous-prison-rate-soars-52-in-decade-report-reveals\">Indigenous prison rate soared 52% in decade, report reveals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the working hours of the teachers were inflexible, with only 62% of hours available for teaching used in 2015. External staff would be able to work more flexible hours, he said.</p> <p>But prison teachers say they are not adequately resourced or staffed to provide the level of teaching prisoners require, with many suffering from complex social and mental health issues. </p> <p>The Greens MP David Shoebridge has described the job losses as \u201can attack on prisoners\u201d. In a meeting on Friday of the committee established to inquire into the performance of government departments, Shoebridge asked Elliott about current NSW prisoner numbers.</p> <p>Elliott revealed the NSW prison population was 11,898, a 7% increase since February. Shoebridge said in order to ensure recidivism rates were lowered, the prisoners needed quality education to prepare them for a future outside jail.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just an attack on prisoners but on the concept of professional teaching, and the government wants to de-professionalise teaching,\u201d Shoebridge told Guardian Australia on Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re not recruiting when current teachers leave, they don\u2019t cover for teachers when they are on leave and they are not resourcing the current teachers to deliver education properly to prisoners, many of whom have special needs.\u201d</p> <p>NSW Teachers Federation organiser Rob Long said it was unclear whether the positions would be privatised. He suspects the Tafe sector will bid when the contract is put out for tender. </p> <p>Among those set to lose their jobs were literacy, numeracy, IT, arts and music teachers, Long said, as well as senior education officer roles, which he said were similar to the position of a school principal. He fears they will be replaced by contracted staff who pass through prisons on high rotation, meaning prisoners would not develop working relationships with their educators.</p> <p>\u201cWhat our teachers have been offering is continuity,\u201d Long said. \u201cThey get to know the students and advocate for them, they organise to try to get them into external tertiary education.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/06/sydneys-long-bay-jail-to-close-when-australias-biggest-prison-built\">Sydney's Long Bay jail to close when Australia's biggest prison built</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEducation in jails reduces recidivism.
