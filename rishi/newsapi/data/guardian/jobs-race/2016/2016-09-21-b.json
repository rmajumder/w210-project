  "<p>There\u2019s a great scene in last season\u2019s Black-ish \u2013 Kenya Barris\u2019s family comedy on ABC \u2013 where a group of co-workers make up a system for who should be allowed to say the N-word. \u201cBill Clinton?

The experience triggered Barris and his writers into making one of the funniest episodes since the show launched two years ago, but more importantly it confirmed something we already knew: the show is a series of modern-day parables on race relations disguised as a comedy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2014/sep/24/black-ish-abc-show-race-issues-review\">Black-ish: a revolutionary new comedy tackling issues of race head on \u2013\u00a0review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here are a group of writers and actors, black and white, teaching America that it\u2019s OK to laugh, it\u2019s OK to cry, it\u2019s even OK to be angry about race \u2013 just make sure you engage with it. Barris began with a show about black identity and it has now developed into something much bigger. \u201cWe should be aware and constantly having conversations about the world because that\u2019s how you change it from the bigger standpoint rather than acutely trying to change things,\u201d he told Vulture. \u201cWe have to get into a place where we are able to have conversations, and it starts with the family. It starts within the home. If you don\u2019t put yourself in the place in your home where you talk about things going on in the world \u2013 you only talk about what\u2019s hip and hot \u2013 then nothing ever gets solved.\u201d<br></p> <p>Black-ish resonates with the African American community and helps white America understand another point of view. The show is a bridge-builder of race, and as the viewer you\u2019re paying attention to the point of the show.</p> <p>So if networks have finally woken up and realized that diversity is not only ethically important but also financially viable in order to create a popular, smart, funny show, then it\u2019s time to focus on a demographic that keeps getting ignored: the Latino audience.</p> <p>When it comes to understanding who the Latino community is \u2013 and I am not talking about immigration and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-taco-bowl-i-love-hispanics-picture\">taco bowls</a> \u2013 the general American still struggles. Despite the fact that 18% of the US population is Latino or Hispanic, we are still mainly ignored by Hollywood. Earlier this year, a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latinos-hollywood-few-roles-frequent-stereotypes-new-study-finds-n523511\">study released by Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative</a> called the Comprehensive Annenberg Report on Diversity, pointed out that out of more than 11,000 speaking characters surveyed in film and TV, 5.8% were Hispanic or Latino. This past Sunday at the Emmys, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/18/when-it-comes-to-the-emmys-few-latino-nominees\">not one single Hispanic or Latino performer nominated in the top acting categories.</a></p> <p>Aside from giving more opportunities for a number of Latino writers and actors, our own Black-ish would open the doors to a conversation about so many issues that remain unresolved \u2013 and just like Barris said, we will be able to change them because we are talking about it ourselves. </p> <p>Picture this hypothetical scene for a moment: the main character, Luis (Lucho) Calder\u00f3n comes back from work (he\u2019s an architect) and sits with his family as they watch Trump\u2019s speech on immigration. The entire episode would focus on Lucho and his wife, Gabriela, having to explain to their children why there is so much hate and ignorance in the only country they know. The impact it would have on an audience could be a powerful statement, similar to Hope \u2013 Black-ish\u2019s remarkable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/25/black-ish-police-brutality-episode-abc-rodney-king\">episode on police brutality from last season</a>.

It firmly established Black-ish, if there was any doubt, as a sitcom that\u2019s not just timely but up to the challenge of its times.\u201d<br><br>Another imaginary episode would deal with Luis\u2019s office as his colleagues celebrate Cinco de Mayo by wearing oversized sombreros and fake mustaches \u2013 in case you\u2019re unsure, this is a big red flag. The storylines are endless. I am a huge admirer of Jane the Virgin and Gina Rodriguez, but the show\u2019s message is less about the family dynamic and more about the value of womanhood \u2013 in this case Latina womanhood.</p> <p>What we need is a family who can stand together alongside the Johnsons and the Carmichaels, the O\u2019Neills, the Huangs and the Goldbergs, to confidently stand up and explain to network executives and America that we need a voice.</p>",

Those forces were Cumbria, Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Staffordshire, South Wales and Wiltshire.</p> <p>Despite government pressure, black people are still four times more likely than white people to face a stop, most of which result in no detection of criminality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/17/mass-stop-and-search-police-crime-study\">Mass stop and search by police doesn't reduce crime, says study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mike Cunningham, a former chief constable who led the inspection for HMIC, told the Guardian: \u201cThe figures for disproportionality are still pretty eye-watering.\u201d</p> <p>Cunningham said: \u201cThe big issue with stop and search, the issue of disproportionality, it has been around for many years. We are not saying that nothing has been done, but it is still a significant issue.\u201d</p> <p>He said police leaders need to find out why disproportionality is happening in their areas: \u201cChief constables need to understand the issues in their areas much better.\u201d</p> <p>Cunningham said 19 forces, including the Met and West Midlands forces, would face an extra inspection of their use of stop and search later this year, with every force in England and Wales being inspected by 2017 on their use of the powers.</p> <p>HMIC had found in February that the 13 worst offenders were Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Gloucestershire, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northumbria, South Wales, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Mercia and Wiltshire.</p> <p>The then home secretary reacted to the finding by HMIC by suspending them from membership of the best use of stop and search scheme. Today, after HMIC found they were finally obeying the rules, they were reinstated.</p> <p>Police leaders reacted by stressing the crime-fighting benefits of stop and search, the use of which has declined dramatically in recent years.</p> <p>Alex Duncan, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales\u2019s professional standards committee, said: \u201cWhen it is properly used, stop and search is an essential tool for operational policing as it disrupts and detects criminal activity, such as knife crime and the proliferation of class A drugs.

  "<p>I doubt I\u2019m the only one disappointed in The Wire creator David Simon\u2019s decision to use the N-word in the context of a joke about Donald Trump choosing Sean Hannity to moderate a town hall focused on black issues. You would think that the man responsible for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/21/tvandradio.guide\">the greatest black drama in television history</a> would be more aware of the fact that black folks don\u2019t like white folks using that word under any circumstances. Of course, that\u2019s sort of the problem here, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it peculiar that the best black TV show of all time was created by a white man?</p> <p>According to an investigation conducted by Variety, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/diversity-television-white-male-showrunners-stats-fox-nbc-abc-cbs-cw-study-1201789639/\">90% of the showrunners</a> hired for new series in the 2016-17 season by broadcast networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, The CW) are white. Only four of the 50 new showrunners are black. David Simon\u2019s place at the head of the black drama table is not just because his show was fantastic. It\u2019s also because of a sheer lack of competition. It\u2019s been three years since Fox debuted Lee Daniels and Danny Strong\u2019s Empire and the networks still lag behind cable \u2013 the format that incubated The Wire \u2013 and streaming giants Netflix and Amazon. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/20/atlanta-brian-tyree-henry-tv-fx-black-culture\">Atlanta star Brian Tyree Henry: if Trump gets elected 'it's going to be Mad Max'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most exciting African American series to hit since Empire is FX\u2019s Atlanta, Donald Glover\u2019s ode to black America\u2019s capital city and a critical look at the modern infantile man. Glover plays Earnest Marks, an aspiring music manager struggling to provide for his estranged girlfriend and young daughter. There\u2019s a casualness of tone to Atlanta that\u2019s rare in prestige black TV. Empire exists in a heightened reality where people poison each other and push their pregnant rivals down the stairs. Dramatic reveals of long-lost mothers come and go without much fanfare, primarily because outrageous plot twists are commonplace. It dulls the senses to the point where nothing is shocking any more. </p> <p>In Atlanta, the southern black experience is treated as matter-of-fact and generally unremarkable. The stakes are small and intimate. Earn\u2019s cousin, the underground rapper Paper Boi \u2013 tragically unrelated to the Paperboy responsible for the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N58TYv7Vt3A\">Ditty</a> \u2013 sells drugs. He carries a gun. He goes to jail for shooting a guy over a broken rear-view mirror. No white character shows up to question the validity of this lifestyle. It\u2019s treated as merely the world in which these people live. Of course, this is part of the surrealist, comedic aspects of Atlanta \u2013 the underplaying of outrageous situations like a drug dealer shooting a man in the back with a hunting rifle or an inmate drinking toilet water while amused onlookers cheer him on \u2013 but it\u2019s also a true joy and a sign of black creatives behind the scenes that blackness is not seen as an impenetrable other. It\u2019s not exotic or beguiling. It\u2019s not mysterious. It just is.</p> <p>The emergence of black creatives behind the scenes of black entertainment has been slow. There have been numerous stops and starts since groundbreaking series like I, Spy and Star Trek made African American faces on TV more acceptable to white audiences. The success of the Wayans brothers\u2019 sketch series In Living Color led to numerous black comedies, many of them on the then fledgling Fox network: Living Single, Roc, Martin, True Colors. They often had black writers and felt authentic to the experience, though within the limiting confines of network TV. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"47832578620c09117f1d9591de5ea676dc44141e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47832578620c09117f1d9591de5ea676dc44141e/0_68_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael K Williams as Omar Little in The Wire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael K Williams as Omar Little in The Wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hope comes in the form of shows such as Marvel\u2019s upcoming Netflix superhero tale Luke Cage \u2013 run by black screenwriter Cheo Hodari Coker \u2013 and Ava DuVernay\u2019s Queen Sugar, a domestic drama about a family that inherits a sugarcane farm. This is as far away from the urban blight and shoot-em-up nature of the typical black series, typified by the Starz network\u2019s Power. Power \u2013 set, like Empire, in the music industry \u2013 suffers from the bleak, violent posturing that has come to define the African American experience on screen and in the media. Much has been made of Queen Sugar challenging black ideas of masculinity through a five-year-old boy character named Blue who carries around a doll. Combine that with Atlanta\u2019s ineffectual protagonist and his rapper cousin\u2019s questioning of hip-hop bravado and you have the makings of a trend.<strong> </strong>This also extends to film, as the upcoming Moonlight chronicles the struggles of a black man to come out \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">a story rarely told</a>.</p> <p>It is not a coincidence that these refreshingly complex visions of blackness come from series fronted by black writers. It\u2019s not that white writers are incapable of telling black stories. Simon\u2019s work on The Wire is a prime example of when that scenario works. The Wire challenged our perception of what a prestige drama could be at a time when they were uniformly white stories of upper middle class suburban angst. What a white writer can miss is the subtle nuance of the experience of living in this world as a black person. When Simon excused his use of the N-word by saying he was employing the version with the suffix \u201ca\u201d as opposed to \u201cer\u201d, he thought he was playing within the boundaries of taste. The truth was that he was far from it, as he found out when numerous prominent black voices such as Jezebel\u2019s Kara R Brown, the Undefeated\u2019s Clinton Yates, the New York Times\u2019 Greg Howard, and New York magazine\u2019s Rembert Browne piped up with their displeasure.</p> <p>One can only know what it\u2019s like to be black in America by being black in America.

He just offered me a lift, he took me all the way from north Tulsa to south Tulsa \u2026 and he didn\u2019t know who I was,\u201d said Jasper, a pastor. They kept in contact.</p> <p>Crutcher came from a family of gospel musicians. The last time he saw Jasper, a couple of months ago, he suggested they get together and create some gospel tracks. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of person that always wanted you laughing, he\u2019s a jokester to his heart, when people are around him he\u2019s going to make sure everybody\u2019s having a good time. He\u2019s not having a good time unless everybody else is.

Some at Tuesday\u2019s demonstration referred to the lingering effects of the race riot of 1921, which saw as many as <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/19/survivors-of-infamous1921tulsaraceriotstillhopeforjustice.html\">300 people killed</a> as the city\u2019s relatively prosperous African American neighbourhood was wrecked.</p> <p>Six years ago the city opened Reconciliation Park to commemorate the riot. It includes a statue of a black man with his arms raised in surrender. Some 95 years on from the terrible violence, several protesters on Tuesday wore T-shirts with the slogan \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d, and lamented that though Crutcher held his arms aloft, the submissive gesture did not save his life in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cI just dropped my aunt off, and I had to wonder,\u201d Jasper said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about whether or not I was going to get shot in the \u2019hood, whether I was going to get robbed; I had to wonder whether or not the police were going to pull me over and do something to me.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Terence Crutcher had his hands up. That didn\u2019t stop him from being shot by Tulsa police on Friday. He was a father, a husband, a churchgoing man, a college student at the age of 40.

Bad cops see large-bodied black men like me and they treat us like wild game. Was Crutcher just too big, too scary, too black to live? </p> <p>This kind of thinking is why some of us fear being perceived as forceful or empowered, especially around law enforcement. We try to avoid attributes that any red-blooded American, white male is raised to embrace as a right. For men of color, death \u2013 not trouble with the law \u2013 is the consequence of getting out of line. It\u2019s been that way since the days of colonial slave codes.</p> <p>I know this well. I write in a doughnut shop several days a week. The same police officers, more or less, see me all the time. They always seem to give me an extra look over, each and every time. They have never smiled or said hello or seemed impressed by the mounds of books surrounding me. None have ever stopped to reassure me that they will look out for me or my things. </p> <p>One once warned me that the aspirin I was about to take (clearly marked aspirin) should be consumed or thrown away because I \u201cwould probably be locked up for probable cause of selling drugs\u201d. Every time I stand up to stretch, the length of my body is scanned by their eyes and entire tables of law enforcement turn around to assess if big, black me is a danger. </p> <p>Of course, I want to believe the police are here for me. To believe they will protect me. But nothing in my experience, including getting hauled off a bus to be searched, or having a gun put to my head as an unarmed, immobile passenger in a traffic stop, with a white driver who moved around without restriction, has told me I have a fighting chance if I am the victim of law enforcement overreach.<br></p> <p>You\u2019ve probably heard of \u201cthe talk\u201d African American parents have with their children. But there is another talk I want to have, one which I shared with friends on social media after I learned of this recent police shooting. It\u2019s the talk about what happens if I am ever in Terence Crutcher\u2019s place. </p> <p>Yes, I will do my absolute best not to do anything to be considered \u201cresisting arrest\u201d or \u201cnot following commands\u201d. I will sit stoically and silently. If they ever get their hands on me, I will sit silently until it\u2019s over \u2013 though those who don\u2019t should never be shot. But if they kill me, I hope my friends bear witness that I was not \u201cone bad dude\u201d.</p> <p>I hope people fight for my character. I want people to remember that I loved to read and I loved to create community and that I didn\u2019t believe in \u201crace\u201d, except for the human one. I loved the south and, despite her history, I tried to retell her story. <strong>I</strong> was a teacher of Torah. I was a teddy bear of a man and not a beast to shoot.</p> <p>I hope they remember: I wasn\u2019t \u201cone bad dude\u201d. I was a strong, black man.</p>",
  "<p>Happiness is a fickle thing: ever-changing, rarely predictable. I was reminded of this a few days ago, when an unlikely instruction made me just about as happy as I\u2019ve ever been in my life. That instruction was: \u201cStop running!\u201d<br></p> <p>For the past 24 hours, you see, my entire existence had been based on completing laps of a 400m track. The event in question, <a href=\"http://www.runandbecome.com/self-transcendence-24-hour-race\">Run and Become\u2019s ever-popular Self Transcendence 24-Hour Track Race</a>, takes place in Tooting Bec, south London, and, if it sounds like your idea of hell, let me tell you that in many ways it was. But that\u2019s not really the point, because although pain and tiredness played leading roles, many lessons were learned. Among them, I discovered the unbreakable nature of the human spirit, the power of positivity and the indigestibility of fig rolls at four in the morning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/aug/30/dean-karnazes-man-run-forever\">Dean Karnazes: the man who can run for ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before all that, though, I arrived at the Tooting Bec track on Saturday morning, the compression-socked embodiment of ignorant bliss. My phone was well-stocked with podcasts and feel-good music; I had enough food to sustain a small village \u2013 as long as it had a collective preference for peanut butter and malt loaf; and, critically, I was safe in the knowledge that I could always just walk. Because 24 hours isn\u2019t <em tabindex=\"-1\">that</em> long, and walking is easy ...</p> <p>A pre-race briefing at 11.15am detailed the basics: every runner has a designated lap counter; you must tell your lap counter every time you leave the track; there\u2019s a change of direction every four hours; a physio is on hand at all times; pace yourselves! And then, after some aimless stretching that I hoped wouldn\u2019t reveal that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, the clock struck noon \u2013 and the journey of self-discovery began.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>With the sun mercifully cloaked in cloud, and everyone\u2019s spirits not yet dampened by monotony, the first few hours were, dare I say it, good fun. I spoke to as many runners as possible, trying to get a sense of what drove them to take part in such a race, but mainly to poach any clever tactics they might have. This had the adverse effect of making me realise just how woefully underprepared I was. One runner, Nick, said that for six months he had been doing double and sometimes even triple-run days. For my part, a recent triple-run week<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>was considered an achievement. But I didn\u2019t say that to Nick; I nodded knowingly, muttered something to suggest I felt his pain, and jogged on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20b8311c24942dbecd0d62d8577bc4c5217f1702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20b8311c24942dbecd0d62d8577bc4c5217f1702/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Just ... keep ... running ... for 24 hours.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just ... keep ... running ... for 24 hours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Galimov Oleg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After four hours, it was clear who the \u201ccompetitors\u201d were. Not content with just finishing, these steely-eyed runners had kept a sustained pace from the off and it was they I blamed for the slight pang of guilt I felt every time I left the track for a wee or a Jelly Baby \u2013 or, as an hourly treat, a wee, a Jelly Baby and a handful of chocolate buttons. High old times.</p> <p>Alas, the high old times were not to last. As the hours ticked by, signs of mental instability began to creep in. I found myself repeating the phrase \u201cJust keep running\u201d \u00e0 la Dory of Finding Nemo fame, and the track began to take on a life of its own: the corners dark and gloomy places, the 100m straights far more positive. </p> <p>Then, eight hours in, signs that my body, too, was beginning to falter. A trip to the on-site physio resulted in a heavily-strapped knee and the non-assurance: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019ll do any permanent damage if you continue.\u201d What had started out at 30 minutes of running and five minutes of walking had gradually decreased to ratios of 25:5, 20:5 and 15:5, before plunging dramatically down to 300m of running and 100m of walking. To add to the woe, darkness had fully descended and whatever limited scenic distractions there were before \u2013 some trees, a steel fence, the odd pigeon \u2013 were gone. If ever there was a time for the promised self-transcendence, this was it. </p> <p>Fortunately, inspiration was in no short supply. A couple of runners in their 70s and several in their 60s ran, plodded and walked on \u2013 many of them having completed the race numerous times previously. Plenty of others kept up a remarkable, unrelenting pace, and every single runner offered words of encouragement. There\u2019s something uniquely motivating about being told, \u201cYou can do it\u201d by someone you don\u2019t know; something that makes you think: You\u2019re right, anonymous stranger, I can<em> </em>do it!</p> <p>The on-track support was echoed by an endless stream of cheers from lap counters and race officials, and eventually \u2013 after much coffee, cake and mental strife \u2013 the endless night did indeed come to an end. I can\u2019t pretend the new dawn brought renewed energy (running was now out of the question), but it did at least bring with it the knowledge that I was going to finish \u2013 a victory, I had come to realise, in itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/08/ultramarathons-running-health-risk\">Running on empty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And, after much clock-watching and an obscene amount of sugar, finish it I did. A 24-hour survivor, if not runner (I came, I saw, I wandered). Many others, though, put in some incredible performances. Take the winner, James Stewart, who, in clocking 160 miles, broke the longstanding course record. Or, even more astonishing, 68-year-old Ann Bath\u2019s 115.9 miles. If this race confirmed anything to me, it\u2019s that runners are the kindest, happiest, most hard-as-nails people on Earth. </p> <p>At time of writing, I can\u2019t move my legs, and my feet are just about visible through a sea of blisters. I\u2019ve come to learn, though, that there is always a silver lining. At 7pm, with boredom setting in, a change of direction was just an hour away. At 3am, in agony and reduced to a walk, I was at least over halfway. At 6am, overcome with tiredness, the sun was at least beginning to rise. And now, despite being temporarily unable to move, the simple fact that I\u2019m not doing laps of a track fills me with unbridled joy. Happiness, it\u2019s a fickle thing. </p>",
  "<p>Some might say that the era of the big budget romance died when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/may/28/features.features11\">Pearl Harbor took a critical drubbing in 2001</a>. And yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/11/avatar-james-cameron-film-review\">James Cameron\u2019s Avatar</a> proved beyond doubt seven years ago that audiences will still sign up for a good old-fashioned love story, provided there\u2019s plenty of spectacle among the lingering glances.

And who can blame them, given that Hollywood and space have a troubled history stretching all the way back to studios\u2019 clunky attempts to mimic the extraordinary success of Star Wars in 1977? The fact that Disney came a cropper far more recently with the similarly pitched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/08/john-carter-review\">John Carter</a> will not have inspired confidence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/20/passengers-trailer-for-jennifer-lawrence-and-chris-pratt-sci-fi-drama-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/53pjp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2735017\"            data-video-name=\"Passengers: trailer for Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt sci-fi drama - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57e1416fe4b02abd56c3f610\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/20/160920PassengersTrailer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/09/20/160920PassengersTrailer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/20/160920PassengersTrailer_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/sep/20/passengers-trailer-for-jennifer-lawrence-and-chris-pratt-sci-fi-drama-video\">Passengers: trailer for Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt sci-fi drama</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is exactly why Passengers, the $120m (some estimates suggest $150m) mega-budget Sony space romance that has just released its debut trailer, is such a surprising arrival on the 2016 scene. It could well be another Avatar waiting to happen. But given Hollywood\u2019s history with outlandishly expensive sci-fi, it could just as easily find itself languishing in DVD store bargain bins in a few years along with faded copies of Mars Needs Moms and The Adventures of Pluto Nash. The fact is, nobody knows how this one will pan out.</p> <p>The initial signs, however, are promising. Passengers, from the excellent Norwegian director of The Imitation Game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/28/imitation-game-director-morten-tyldum-passengers\">Morten Tyldum</a>, has the look of a glossy 21st-century update of classic 70s space movies such as <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dark_star/\">Dark Star</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067756/\">Silent Running</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069293/\">Solaris</a>, all from that era in which sci-fi film-makers loved to riff on the endless boredom of travel between the stars and imagine madness taking root in the cosmos like cholera in dirty water.</p> <p>Hollywood hot properties Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are the two star travellers who have woken early from hibernation to discover their ship and the lives of all 5,259 on board are in deep doo-doo. Will they find love in the cosmos, or will they end up tearing each other apart? And is there more to their once-in-a-lifetime coming together than we might initially have been led to believe?</p> <p>The major difference between Passengers and its 70s forebears is that the Starship Avalon appears to boast all the mod cons of 22nd-century living, including a robot barman (an ingeniously cast <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/passengers-michael-sheen-jennifer-lawrence-chris-pratt-1201535570/\">Michael Sheen</a>) to serve our hero and heroine on their first space date. But will all that luxury help keep the happy couple sane when they are the only two conscious souls for millions of light years? And has Sheen been reading from the Cameron-Scott guide to evil robots?</p> <p>Space romance it may be, but Tyldum\u2019s movie is also ploughing a rather different furrow to Avatar. Cameron\u2019s film succeeded despite the absence of any major A-list names \u2013 it was all about the film-maker\u2019s back catalogue and those spine-tingling visuals \u2013 while Passengers appears to be the very definition of a star-driven blockbuster, almost a throwback to an era where studios would line up their romantic two-hander \u2013 Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn in the 1940s, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in the 90s \u2013 and worry about what movie they were making later. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51afd461e3b77bd3fa7c1e39f59f73a578a5f9ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51afd461e3b77bd3fa7c1e39f59f73a578a5f9ab/180_0_2516_1510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in Passengers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in Passengers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sony is reportedly paying Lawrence a barely-heard-of $20m fee, famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/17/jennifer-lawrence-to-be-paid-8m-more-than-chris-pratt-for-passengers\">$8m more than Pratt will receive as the male lead</a>. Yet none of Tyldum\u2019s previous films have exactly driven all before them at the box office, and Passengers cannot even count on a pre-existing fanbase to help it on opening weekend \u2013 as it\u2019s based on an entirely original script that made the 2007 blacklist of the best unfilmed screenplays in Hollywood. The studio really is banking on the Norwegian mining gold from Pratt and Lawrence\u2019s star power and abundant chemistry, a brave move when its rivals are all obsessed with cinematic universes and endless remakes, adaptations and sequels.</p> <p>One major roadblock for the movie may be that <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/jennifer-lawrence-in-talks-to-star-in-sonys-space-romance-passengers/\">early industry reports</a> appeared to give away its central twist \u2013 heavily hinted at in the new trailer \u2013 though it\u2019s possible Tyldum has since rejigged <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Spaihts\">Jon Spaihts</a>\u2019 screenplay. Another is that Passengers is due to debut in cinemas just a couple of weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story\">Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</a>. Will audiences turn up for two giant space movies in a matter of weeks?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/17/jennifer-lawrence-to-be-paid-8m-more-than-chris-pratt-for-passengers\">Jennifer Lawrence to be paid $8m more than Chris Pratt for Passengers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Sony does pull off a surprise smash, it could be a game-changer. Tyldum\u2019s film appears to offer a tentative pathway for the industry to shift back towards original big-budget film-making and away from the incessant hum of superhero movies that have overtaken the slates of at least half the major studios \u2013 and to begin trusting to the talent of its finest actors, screenwriters and directors once again, rather than being forced to rely so heavily on pre-existing fanbases.<br></p> <p>Much has been made of Hollywood\u2019s creative redundancy at a time when TV is experiencing a golden age, but studios cannot just steal all the small screen\u2019s best ideas and put them in the multiplexes, for the two mediums work on vastly different dynamics. As Cameron so smartly spotted in the 1980s, blockbuster cinema requires genuine spectacle to make its mark in the modern era, for no other reason than that audiences might as well stay at home if they are only paying their hard-earned bucks to see the same content on a larger screen. But that does not mean that extravagant tentpole film-making, with the kind of synapse-searing effects that only cinemas are capable of showing off in their full glory, cannot be delivered with verve and originality. </p> <p>Just as Starship Avalon is not the only damaged vessel floundering in increasingly uncertain territory, Sony bigwigs will not be the only studio executives hoping that Passengers proves to be a major hit. One imagines the whole of Hollywood would very much like to ride the success of Tyldum\u2019s film all the way to its own new golden age.</p>"
