  "<p>A cheque processing company is closing seven sites across the UK with the loss of 600 jobs, ahead of the nationwide introduction of new cheque imaging technology.</p> <p>Intelligent Processing Solutions Ltd (iPSL), which processes 5m cheques a day, said it plans to slash its operations to two sites in Northampton and Milton Keynes. This will reduce its workforce to just over 700 people, according to the Unite union, which described the job losses as \u201ctragic\u201d.</p> <p>The company blamed the introduction of the image clearing system, planned for October 2017, for the planned cuts, saying would have a \u201chuge impact\u201d on the cheque clearing process. iPSL handles 80% of all cheques in the UK year, with a value of \u00a3700bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/19/cheques-bounce-into-the-digital-age\">Cheques bounce into the digital age</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cheque imaging will save customers a trip to their bank by allowing them to take a photograph of a cheque and send it via their smartphones, speeding up the process.

Unite wants iPSL to make the necessary investment through new technology to secure as many jobs as is possible.\u201d</p> <p>Unite has pressed the company to provide training and outplacement support to staff.</p> <p>The use of cheques has been declining for years. But after the payments industry announced plans to phase out cheques by October 2018, there was a backlash from consumers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jul/12/cheques-abolition-plan-scrapped\">the government intervened</a>. It said cheques would only be phased out if adequate alternatives were in place.</p> <p>The Treasury accepted that cheques remain popular, especially with older people, tradespeople, small businesses and charities, and for family gifts.</p> <p>The industry body expects the annual rate of decline in cheque volumes to slow as their use becomes more concentrated among those who have a strong preference for paying by cheque.</p>",
  "<p>After local Democratic parties in six battleground states filed lawsuits against Trump adviser Roger Stone\u2019s voter fraud monitoring project, the Republican operative released new rules for volunteer monitors and pledged to a Nevada judge that he \u201cwill not target voters based on their race\u201d.</p> <p>Roger Stone, an informal Trump adviser, also told the Guardian on Monday that he was concerned that the Republican party in Ohio would try to manipulate votes to undermine Trump, and said that the Stop the Steal fraud prevention project was a \u201cneutral process\u201d.</p> <p>Stone had announced the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/20/citizens-for-donald-trump-exit-poll-roger-stone-rigged-election-claim\">Stop the Steal</a> voter fraud prevention project to the Guardian in late October.

  "<p>Until recently, Black Friday was the \u201cmust do\u201d shopping event for British retailers keen to cash in on the mass of frenzied shoppers looking for a bargain. But the Chinese version \u2013 Singles Day, held on 11 November (or 11.11) and created to celebrate single people \u2013 is gathering pace, potentially presenting a bigger opportunity for British retailers than its US counterpart. The sheer scale of the market \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/alibabas-singles-day-sales-up-60-to-94bn\">\u00a311.28bn was spent on Singles Day in 2015</a> \u2013combined with the acute Chinese appetite for British goods, has opened up a significant new sales avenue.<br></p> <p>Last year, Topshop saw its sales surge by over 900% compared to Singles Day in 2014. \u201cThese results clearly indicate how impactful this online calendar moment has become, and as a key focus market for the brand we see 11.11 as a great way to raise brand awareness and conversion in China,\u201d says a Topshop spokesperson. </p> <p>Topshop is not alone in seeing the annual event as a chance to gain a foothold in the Chinese market. More British retailers are cashing in on the world\u2019s biggest online event, says Jason Yu, general manager of Kantar Worldpanel China. \u201cUsing e-commerce as a way to enter the market is relatively low-risk approach and they can understand better the appetite of the Chinese consumers and learn how to operate in China without substantial investment in opening stores.\u201d<br></p> <p>Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant which trademarked the term 11.11 and made Singles Day synonymous with people treating themselves to gifts, last year recorded sales of \u00a39.4bn during the 24-hour event. Meifang Chen, international business development at Alibaba Group, echoes Yu\u2019s thoughts: \u201cIf a British retailer wants to enter the thriving Chinese market and engage with its consumers, 11:11 delivers both excellent product accessibility for consumers and massive exposure for brands.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Cashing in on the shopping bonanza</h2> <p>It is an approach taken by Waitrose, which partnered with Chinese marketing and logistics specialist Avenue 51 to start exporting to China in April this year, selling through the Royal Mail shop on China\u2019s Tmall. \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve had a modest introduction into the market, the potential for Waitrose in China is huge,\u201d says Nigel Roberts, Waitrose B2B growth and development manager. \u201cSingles Day is a big occasion for consumers and businesses in China and has the potential to give the products we offer more exposure and provide another opportunity to test demand for our brand.\u201d<br></p> <p>Waitrose has already expanded its product offering from 30 items to more than 50 on Tmall, and its first Singles Day will doubtless provide more valuable insight into what tickles the fancy of Chinese consumers.<br></p> <p>Chen says part of the success of Singles Day comes from the diversity of products on offer: \u201cLast year\u2019s 11.11 broke eight product-sale world records; these included selling 10.1m litres of milk, 3.1m mobile handsets, 1.1m watches and 643,964 televisions.\u201d<br></p> <p>It is certainly all-embracing. Consumer healthcare start-up Make A Dent Ventures (MAD Ventures) sells TINT, its teeth whitening product, to Chinese consumers via Tmall. Mark Curry, founder and director at MAD Ventures says Singles Day will act as \u201cboth a great launch pad to showcase TINT to the Chinese market and as an opportunity to drive trial\u201d of the new product.<br></p> <p>Curry was formerly a senior buyer at Boots, which participated in Black Friday with \u201chuge success\u201d, but he acknowledges the potential of Singles Day to eclipse the event in importance. \u201cIt is common knowledge that Black Friday is now the highest grossing sales day in the UK, but this may get superseded by Singles Day [because the] concept of gifting feels a lot more meaningful than an arbitrary sales day.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Building awareness</h2> <p>Yu also believes Singles Day will gain the edge on Black Friday, in part because more British retailers are beginning to sell their wares via Tmall. \u201cAccording to Kantar Worldpanel, approximately 50% of Chinese consumers already shop in the e-commerce stores, and given that Singles Day presents an enormous opportunity for retailers to present their offers to the Chinese shopper, we believe eventually it will become a bigger opportunity, though it may take years for British retailers to build more online awareness.\u201d</p> <p>A key point is knowing what to discount and by how much during the event. Independent British jewellery brand Lily Charmed works with Avenue 51 and began trading in China over two years ago. It is also gearing up for its first Singles Day. Director Jonathan Lee says the company will \u201cheavily discount\u201d its range \u201cto ensure a decent share of voice among all the other discounts available on that day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRightly or wrongly, consumers are not only searching for but expect deep discounts so you have to give them what they want,\u201d says Lee. \u201cUnlike any other country, it\u2019s only because of the sheer scale of the Chinese market that we can offer such discounts.\u201d<br></p> <p>Others, such as multi-website retailer The Hut Group, which has been investing in the Asian market for over two years and has participated in Singles Day before, will be running offers including 40% off haircare and up to 30% off skincare. Wing Chan, group marketing director at The Hut Group says the company has previously seen \u201cmassive spikes\u201d on Singles Day in China and expects to see \u201cat least double\u201d the sales on beauty products compared to last year. <br></p> <p>The Holland &amp; Barrett franchise is also confident. The company began trading on Tmall a few months before Singles Day last year, generating close to \u00a30.5m in online and offline sales during the event. It is hoping to hit the \u00a31m mark this year.<br></p> <p>With Alibaba alone racking up sales of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/alibabas-singles-day-sales-up-60-to-94bn\">\u00a39bn on Singles Day in 2015</a>, up 60% on 2014, it\u2019s likely that revenues this year will rocket once again this year. </p> <h2>Attracting international brands </h2> <p>The pickings could be rich for British retailers going forward. Chen points out that Singles Day is bigger than the entire Black Friday weekend, including Cyber Monday, and says the increase in the number of international brands joining has been \u201csignificant\u201d, with Dyson coming on board in 2014 and Macy\u2019s, Hugo Boss and United Biscuits joining the event in 2015. He attributes some of its success to the growth in technology. \u201cIn contrast, many Black Friday opportunities are concentrated on the high street, which is not always convenient for those just wanting to shop from home, on their mobile or from more rural areas.\u201d </p> <p>Indeed, figures from Worldpay have shown that the total value of transactions made on UK cards on <a href=\"http://www.essentialretail.com/ecommerce/article/5649b6ef96cad-china-singles-days-has-growing-impact-on-uk-shoppers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Singles Day grew 251% year-on-year in 2015</a>, while the volume of transactions was up by 307%, suggesting that Singles Day is gaining traction among UK shoppers too.<br></p> <p>Curry has high hopes: \u201cThis year and next year could be a real blue-touchpaper moment for 11.11 with UK brands and retailers who are China-focused.

A number of MPs, including the Sydney Liberals Julian Leeser and Jason Falinski, and the Victorian Liberal MP Russell Broadbent, have argued that complaints about the act can be fixed with a procedural change, not a rewrite of a legal provision.</p> <p>A number of other government MPs, including the large group of Coalition senators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/cory-bernardis-racial-discrimination-revolt-supported-by-up-to-20-senators\">who signed on to Cory Bernardi\u2019s private member\u2019s bill earlier in the year</a>, believe the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d should be removed from 18C.</p> <p>A number expressed that view during Tuesday\u2019s regular meeting of Coalition members and senators.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18c.html\">Section 18C says</a> it is unlawful for a person to do an act in public which is \u201creasonably likely, in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\u201d another person or a group of people.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18d.html\">Section 18D makes</a> exceptions for artistic works, discussions, debates, event reports in the public interest and fair comment if it is in \u201cexpression of a genuine belief\u201d held by the person making the comment.</p> <p>The Liberal senator Dean Smith <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/28/broaden-free-speech-debate-beyond-racial-discrimination-act-says-liberal-senator\">had been lobbying for a more broad-ranging inquiry into curbs on free speech</a> \u2013 not just the 18C and 18D restrictions \u2013 and on Tuesday Smith told Guardian Australia people would still be able to raise broader issues during the course of the inquiry, which is due to report next February.</p> <p>Smith said the terms of reference released by Brandis after the meeting included a mention of a <a href=\"https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/freedoms-alrc129-summary\">wide-ranging report from the Australian Law Reform Commission</a> released this year which examined the encroachment of commonwealth laws on free speech.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition to the contemporary controversies over 18C, the reference to the ALRC report [in the terms of reference for the inquiry] \u2026 allows for broader consideration of the issues,\u201d Smith said Tuesday.</p> <p>The terms of reference point to chapter four of the ALRC inquiry, which canvassed freedom of public discussion, freedom of conscience, academic freedom, artistic freedom, freedom of religious worship and freedom of the press.</p> <p>Confirmation of the inquiry into 18C came as the government attempted to intensify political pressure on Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/08/labor-unanimously-rejects-governments-proposed-lifetime-refugee-travel-ban\">after the opposition resolved formally on Tuesday</a> to reject the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/30/asylum-seekers-face-lifetime-ban-on-entering-australia-if-they-arrive-by-boat\">plan to ban refugees </a>in offshore detention from ever entering Australia.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/nov/08/plebiscite-bill-fails-politics-live-penny-wong-george-brandis\">In a question time attack</a> that at times bordered on political pantomime, the government bowled up a series of \u201cdorothy dixers\u201d across various portfolios allowing various government frontbenchers to contend that Labor was weak on border protection.</p> <p>The government has sent broad public hints that the proposed lifetime ban on asylum seekers ever entering Australia is connected to the government\u2019s efforts to secure a third-country resettlement agreement that would allow detainees on Nauru and Manus Island to be moved out of conditions that have amounted to indefinite detention.</p> <p>Labor says the government has provided no concrete evidence to support this claim in private briefings.</p> <p>In question time, the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said the government\u2019s policy was \u201cto get people off Manus and Nauru, starting with the families\u201d. Addressing the opposition, Dutton said he would provide details \u201cshortly\u201d.</p> <p>The level of expectation within government ranks for the past couple of weeks suggests the resettlement agreement is close.</p> <p>A new opinion poll released late on Tuesday suggests the government\u2019s proposed lifetime ban has majority support in the community.</p> <p>The Essential poll said 56% of its sample approved of the government\u2019s legislation to ban asylum seekers who arrive by boat from ever being allowed into Australia. 29% of respondents disapproved.</p> <p>A separate question from Essential on whether or not the government was too soft or too hard on asylum seekers found that 24% of the sample, down 5% since August, think the government is too soft on asylum seekers, while 23%, up 2%, think they are too tough.</p> <p>Thirty-seven per cent of the sample, up 6%, think the Coalition is taking the right policy approach.</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, Dutton expressed confidence he could get the lifetime ban through the parliament without Labor\u2019s support.</p> <p>But the Nick Xenophon bloc has only signalled willingness to talk about the proposal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/08/labor-unanimously-rejects-governments-proposed-lifetime-refugee-travel-ban\">Labor rejects government's proposed lifetime refugee travel ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Xenophon told Guardian Australia this legislation would be a conscience issue for his parliamentary group, meaning they may not vote as a bloc, which puts a question mark over whether the government will be able to secure passage of the lifetime ban without Labor\u2019s backing.</p> <p>Labor hit back on the border attack by asking a series of questions about why Turnbull had earlier this year ruled out reopening the 18C debate but had now changed his mind.</p> <p>The Labor backbencher Anne Aly, an anti-radicalisation expert, asked Turnbull whether he had consulted security agencies on the consequences of reopening the RDA debate \u2013 given Abbott had cited national security concerns as a reason for abandoning his politically disastrous attempt to overhaul 18C during the last parliament.</p> <p>Aly quoted Abbott saying: \u201cWhen it comes to cracking down on terrorism and cracking down on things that aid and abet terrorism, the 18C proposal was becoming a needless complication.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull didn\u2019t provide a direct answer to Aly\u2019s question, declaring that Australia was \u201cthe most successful multicultural society in the world\u201d.</p>"
