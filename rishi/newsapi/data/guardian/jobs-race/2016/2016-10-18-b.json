  "<p>LGBT and HIV-affected people are facing barriers to basic help and services when they report incidents of violence by an intimate partner, according to a new report by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP).</p> <p>An analysis of almost 2,000 incidents reported to NCAVP member organizations in 2015 found that violence survivors were frequently denied services and treated as criminals when reporting violence. The report comes in the middle of what looks to be the most violent year for transgender women, with <a href=\"http://www.avp.org/storage/documents/2016.10.13_ncavp_mr_brandibledsoeoh.pdf\">22 reported homicides</a> so far in 2016 \u2013 the same number for all of last year, according to NCAVP.</p> <p>Half of those who sought access to an emergency shelter were denied, the report found, and a quarter of people found police to be \u201chostile\u201d or \u201cindifferent\u201d when reporting an incident. One-third of people also said they faced arrest after reporting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/04/transgender-violence-lgbt-rights-activists\">LGBT activists call for new focus on violence against transgender community</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Intimate partner violence includes physical and verbal abuse, as well as threats and intimidation, by current and past lovers, and occasionally roommates. </p> <p>The organization found that transgender women faced intimate partner violence involving physical and financial abuse at rates three times higher other identities within the LGBT community.

  "<p>\u2018Don\u2019t send me a script if you want me to play the best black friend\u201d, David Oyelowo told NPR last year. The actor was, of course, referencing that tired trope of casting a black \u201cbuddy\u201d to a white lead; someone to offer a helping hand without having a fleshed-out narrative of their own. It\u2019s rare for the black best friend to have his or her own identity, and even rarer for two black friends to bag screen time together. </p> <p>However, TV is slowly changing, and in recent years audiences have been exposed to a wave of smart, black-led US shows ushered in by the likes of Shonda Rhimes and Lee Daniels. The Bechdel test has long been a yardstick for equality in TV and film, but we have entered the age of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/01/ava-duvernay-test-racial-diversity-hollywood-selma-director-oscars\">DuVernay test</a>: that is, black characters having their own identities and interactions. Now, we have a further offering: HBO\u2019s comedy Insecure. It feels especially fresh where friendship is concerned, offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/11/bbc3-fleabag-louie-girls-transparent-master-of-none-sadcom\">millennial sadcom vibes</a> while charting a bond often underrepresented on screen. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/11/issa-rae-insecure-misadventures-of-awkward-black-girl-hbo-tv-comedy\">Issa Rae: from Awkward Black Girl to HBO star</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Issa Rae, known for the <a href=\"http://awkwardblackgirl.com/\">Awkward Black Girl</a> webseries which saw her hone her offbeat rapping style, plays the lead (also named Issa) in the Los Angeles-set comedy, while Nigerian-American comic Yvonne Orji is best pal Molly. The show subverts lazy stereotypes of the strong black female and, as its title suggests, delves into the protagonists\u2019 emotions in three dimensions.</p> <p>\u201cBlack female relationships are incredibly significant on shows like Insecure, because they\u2019re a symbol of sisterhood and camaraderie,\u201d says Mekeisha Madden Toby, a TV critic from LA who writes for the black lifestyle magazine Essence. \u201cAs a black woman watching, it\u2019s comforting seeing people who look and talk like me and my friends because it acknowledges our feelings. It\u2019s like a much-needed hug from a friend. Issa and Molly\u2019s conversations with each other are raw and authentic.\u201d </p> <p>Although they lead wildly different lives (fictional Issa works in the nonprofit sector with underprivileged kids, while Molly is a high-powered lawyer) the pair contend with the same everyday problems: how, as African American women, to find quality relationships; how to fit in with their majority white work environments; how to avoid \u201chotep n*ggas\u201d. Yes, they use the n word and often speak in slang between themselves, where they\u2019re free to be the Carefree Black Girls they can\u2019t necessarily be in public. (Indeed, episode two sees Issa upset that her colleagues have been exchanging \u201csecret white emails\u201d behind her back, but feels she can\u2019t make her ire known). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04cb5935cbad9df606bd427a281ac13c53bb8a82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04cb5935cbad9df606bd427a281ac13c53bb8a82/0_0_2909_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"They often speak in slang, where they\u2019re free to be the Carefree Black Girls they can\u2019t necessarily be in public \u2026 Issa Rae and Yvonne Orji in Insecure.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"722\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">They often speak in slang, where they\u2019re free to be the Carefree Black Girls they can\u2019t necessarily be in public \u2026 Issa Rae and Yvonne Orji in Insecure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Marie Fox/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as the way Issa and Molly code-switch their language and behaviour, we see how they relate to each other \u2013 or fail to do so. The \u201cBroken Pussy\u201d rap that Issa drops to Kelis\u2019s Bossy (sample lyric: \u201cmaybe it\u2019s dry as hell/maybe it really smells\u201d) in the pilot isn\u2019t just vulgar comic garnish, but the crux of a conversation about black female sexuality and singledom that\u2019s not defined by otherness. </p> <p>Similarly, this week\u2019s instalment sees the pair speak frankly \u2013 and hilariously \u2013 about online dating as a black woman, with Molly explaining the challenges to Issa, who has one foot out of her relationship with hopeless app designer Lawrence. Molly, who is obsessed with being accepted by \u201celite\u201d dating app The League, breaks down the options for Issa: \u201cThat\u2019s OKCupid. It\u2019s free, so it\u2019s like bottom of the barrel dudes. Tinder used to be cool, but now it\u2019s basically a fuck app.\u201d A brilliant, highly Shazamable playlist overseen by Solange binds the whole thing, featuring umpteen female artists and occasionally juxtaposing the pair\u2019s lapses in assertiveness. If Issa and Molly aren\u2019t always 100% sure they\u2019re doing the right thing, you get the feeling New York rapper Junglepussy singing \u201cbling bling bitch, do my own thing bitch\u201d makes up for it.</p> <p>Insecure feels exciting because it takes that ennui-filled, existential crisis vibe \u2013 seen everywhere from Broad City to Fleabag \u2013 and puts it in the context of a type of friendship that is often denied air time, with women who may well have felt confined to those dreaded best friend roles in the recent past. With all of the hypersexualised images of black female sexuality that exist, it\u2019s refreshing to see a writer like Rae reclaiming something for herself rather than, say, settling for a walk-on part on Girls. As she raps to a mirror, she\u2019s letting awkward black girls everywhere see themselves mirrored back.</p> <p><em>Insecure airs on HBO on Sundays at 10.30pm in the US, and on Sky Atlantic on Tuesdays at 10.45pm in the UK. </em></p>",

Vegas insiders \u2013 or just those who casually follows the NFL \u2013 know by now that it\u2019s never smart to pick the six-time Super Bowl champions to beat a bad football team. The Steelers\u2019 latest humiliation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DJGalloEtc/status/785223483135520769\">wasn\u2019t hard to see coming</a>. Nor was their loss three weeks earlier to the Eagles, in another game most thought they\u2019d win in a blowout, only to see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DJGalloEtc/status/779339717477273600\">the Steelers get routed 34-3</a>. This is what the Mike Tomlin-Ben Roethlisberger era Steelers do. Every year. They lose to the teams everyone else beats. Detroit\u2019s 0-16 mark in 2008 should have an asterisk because the Steelers weren\u2019t on their schedule.</p> <p>Pittsburgh\u2019s record in its last 16 road games against sub-.500 teams on the road is now 5-11. And calling the Dolphins simply \u201csub-.500\u201d and not straight \u201cawful\u201d is generous. They were dominated by the Titans and Bengals in their previous two games and only beat the Browns in overtime at home in week three thanks to Cleveland\u2019s kicker missing a game-winner at the end of regulation. But against Pittsburgh, the team every loser wants on its schedule, they picked off Roethlisberger twice, shut down Antonio Brown, put up 30 points and dominated the game at the line of scrimmage as Jay Ajayi ran for 204 yards and two touchdowns, a performance I\u2019m comfortable calling the greatest in NFL history by a British running back. </p> <p>\u201cNo need to sugarcoat. We got beat soundly,\u201d Tomlin said after the game, the standard meaningless cliche he delivers after each case of Tomlining in his 10 years at the helm in Pittsburgh. (For reasons of keeping this column under the length of a novel, only a few of the trademark defeats will be recounted here.) There was the 2009 loss to the 2-7 Chiefs when the Steelers were 6-3. \u201cI take responsibility for that performance,\u201d Tomlin said after that one. \u201cI have to have this football team better prepared to play.\u201d OK! Great! Two weeks later, the Steelers lost to the 3-8 Raiders and then followed that up with a defeat at the hands of the 1-11 Cleveland Browns. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/16/nfl-scores-dolphins-steelers-brady-patriots-bengals-lions-bills\">NFL wrap: Dolphins shock Steelers while Brady and Beckham excel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Steelers lost again to the Browns in 2012, when they were 6-4 and Cleveland was 2-8. \u201cThat was an ugly performance,\u201d Tomlin said after the game. Two weeks later, they lost to the 4-8 Chargers. \u201cI have no clue [why we\u2019re inconsistent],\u201d Roethlisberger chimed in after that one with some of his own clueless analysis. \u201cIf I knew, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d do it any more.\u201d Good stuff. One year later the Steelers lost to an 0-3 Vikings team and a 2-4 Raiders team. One year after that, they fell to 0-3 Buccaneers and the 1-8 Jets. That Jets game is the greatest example of Tomlining of all, as the Steelers managed to put up just 13 points against the lowly Jets one week after Roethlisberger set an NFL record by throwing six touchdown passes in back-to-back games. \u201cWe\u2019ll accept responsibility for what happened and get ready for our next opportunity,\u201d Tomlin cliched in the moments following his masterpiece. There have been no less than three instances of Tomlining since.</p> <p>Of course, all top NFL franchises get upset from time to time. Every opponent in the NFL is full of professionals who are talented and work hard and want to win. But no other team so consistently loses to the dregs of the league like Tomlin\u2019s Steelers. They have 14 losses over the past six seasons to teams with a combined .195 winning percentage, while the Steelers entered those games with a combined winning percentage of .581. The college game long ago gave us \u201cClemsoning\u201d, the act of inexplicably playing horribly in a big game, but Tomlining is far worse. The Steelers are not losing to good opponents, they\u2019re falling to the worst of the worst and almost every time out.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I look at it, I don\u2019t look at who we play or their record or things of that nature,\u201d Tomlin said after Sunday\u2019s Tomlining. \u201cI look at how we perform. We didn\u2019t perform well enough to win today.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s probably time for Tomlin to look at things completely different and things of that nature if he ever wants to get back to the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh\u2019s annual Tomlining isn\u2019t just a nuisance or odd quirk of a champion: it\u2019s a consistent problem that stacks the deck against a talented team each postseason. Pittsburgh hasn\u2019t earned a first-round bye in the playoffs since making the Super Bowl in 2010 and that fact \u2013 and missing the postseason entirely in 2012 and 2013 with 8-8 records \u2013 is entirely thanks to Tomlining two or three times a season. Pittsburgh \u2013 on paper, at least \u2013 should be 6-0 right now and a game ahead of the Patriots in the AFC. Instead, they\u2019re a game back and will almost inevitably fall two games behind this Sunday when Landry Jones welcomes the New England Patriots to Heinz Field. It\u2019s mid-October and Pittsburgh\u2019s shot at homefield in the AFC is all but gone. Hashtag: Tomlining.</p> <p>It would at least be encouraging for Pittsburgh fans if Tomlin showed any recognition of the problem or attempted to change up his approach. But outside of losing to losers, Tomlin\u2019s time as a head coach has been defined by his complete unwillingness to improve at his craft and his stubbornness in the face of criticism, no matter how constructive. Tomlin struggled with clock management when he took over the Steelers in 2007, as most rookie coaches do, but has not improved one iota in that regard and seems to wear that fact as a badge of honor. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarcSesslerNFL/status/712249382620504064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomlin says he &#39;goes with his gut&#39; on time-management decisions in games.

Roethlisberger\u2019s latest injury is no surprise \u2013 he\u2019s played 16 games just twice in the last eight years \u2013 yet Pittsburgh will now hand its team, supposedly built to compete for the Super Bowl, over to Jones indefinitely. Instead of having a capable veteran or young, quarterback-in-waiting on the roster, its Year Four of the Landry Jones Experience in Pittsburgh. Forget the No1 seed, with multiple games of Jones and another Tomlining or two \u2013 the Steelers play/lose to the winless Browns one month from now! \u2013 Pittsburgh could miss the playoffs entirely. </p> <p>No one rational is calling for Tomlin\u2019s job. His many flaws aside, he\u2019s still one of the most successful head coaches in the league (although that may say more about the quality of the coaches in the NFL). Tomlin gets his teams prepared and fired up to take on the top teams with the best. He\u2019s just incapable of beating the worst. That will likely prevent him from getting back to the Super Bowl. But the good news is: if the Steelers do make another Super Bowl, a 4-12 team won\u2019t be waiting for them. That means they\u2019ll have a chance to win.</p>"
