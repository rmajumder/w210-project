  "<p>Colin Kaepernick has come under fierce scrutiny for refusing to stand during the national anthem as a protest against racism and police violence. To some extent, this is expected \u2013 it is, after all, the national anthem. But what goes beyond the pale is the suggestion that Kaepernick \u2013 who is an adoptee \u2013 was acting out of place given that his adoptive parents are white. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/29/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-fundamentally-american\">Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest is fundamentally American | Ijeoma Oluo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fox News anchor Brian Kilmeade said: \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, he was adopted by two white parents, he was well supported. He is a great athlete, I\u2019m sure he worked hard, I also heard his grades were great.\u201d</p> <p>The underlying assumption \u2013 that Kaepernick was being ungrateful to white America by protesting against racism \u2013 is as troubling as it is offensive. Why would the race of his adoptive parents be relevant to his protest? Are we to deduce that if a white couple agreed to adopt a black or biracial child, then systemic racism isn\u2019t a problem?<br></p> <p>Kaepernick, whose white birthmother <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/blog/the-grapevine/colin-kaepernicks-birth-mother-scolds-him-on-twitter-over-national-anthem/\">wasted no time in tweeting her disapproval</a> of his activism, continued: \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d <br></p> <p>In addition to his birthmother, who <a href=\"https://www.good.is/articles/why-it-s-perfectly-acceptable-that-colin-kaepernick-doesn-t-want-to-meet-his-birthmother\">re-emerged in Kaepernick\u2019s life</a> at the height of his career four years ago, conservative pundits and public figures alike have criticized his decision to stay silent during the anthem as unpatriotic. <br></p> <p>The Star Spangled Banner, which as John Legend pointed out, isn\u2019t even that good of a song, concludes with the infamous lyrics: \u201cThe star spangled banner / In triumph shall wave / O\u2019er the land of the free / And the home of the brave!\u201d Land of the free. Home of the brave. I think we all know who ended up free and who is still out here trying to be brave.</p> <p>The funny thing about about being black and also having been raised by white parents is that it is doesn\u2019t change the fact that we are black when we are born \u2013 whether by two black birth parents, or one white and one black \u2013 and we are black when we are adopted. We are still black when we decide what that means to us on a personal, cultural or activist level in America. We are children of our adoptive parents, but we are also children of black culture and history.</p> <p>While being light-skinned black or biracial, as Kaepernick is, affords its own privileges in a society riddled not just by racism but also by colorism, it doesn\u2019t offer full immunity from racism \u2013 or anything close to it. Trolls called <a href=\"http://www.totalprosports.com/2016/08/27/kaepernick-attacked-on-social-media-with-ngger-comments-for-not-standing-during-national-anthem/\">Kaepernick racial epithets</a>, after all. He is a reminder that being black in America, no matter how light or dark skinned you are, means shielding yourself against the inevitable arbitrary assessment of your worth at the drop of a dime.</p> <p>That is not understood by everyone. I\u2019m talking to you too, Rodney Harrison, <a href=\"http://thebiglead.com/2016/08/30/rodney-harrison-says-colin-kaepernick-doesnt-understand-because-hes-not-black/\">who tweeted</a> that Kaepernick could not understand what black people face because \u201che\u2019s not black\u201d. Who died and made you King Kunta? But also, as BuzzFeed national editor Adam Serwer pointed out: even if Kaepernick were white, shouldn\u2019t he still care about racism? Shouldn\u2019t everybody care about racism? <br></p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s the lesson here \u2013 if we can concede to a lesson or learning moment: American racism decimates black livelihood, now and in 1812 when the Star Spangled Banner was written, while white people stand around deciding what patriotism means. </p> <ul> <li>The headline of this piece was amended on 1 September 2016. The original said \u201cColin Kaepernick can protest racism\u201d; it now says \u201cColin Kaepernick can protest against racism.\u201d</li> </ul>",
  "<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s designation of the White Lives Matter organization <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/us/white-lives-matter-has-been-declared-a-hate-group.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share\">as a hate group</a> this week confirms what we already knew: that a group of white racists have organized what might be called a backlash to the Black Lives Matter surge. </p> <p>It is more accurate, though, to view it as a continuation of a long and dreadful history of white supremacy in America. This country\u2019s practice of anti-black racism coupled with official denial of institutional racism and collective amnesia regarding the horrors and crimes inflicted on black people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/15/black-american-culture-movement-identity-racism-political-art\">nurtures white resentment against black advancement</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/25/trump-trying-to-woo-black-voters-not-buying-it\">Trump is trying to woo black voters. We're not buying it | Barrett Holmes Pitner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>White supremacist groups rose in the civil war\u2019s aftermath, organized by southern white people determined to use violence to deny Reconstruction-era promotion of black citizenship. The Ku Klux Klan is the most famous of these groups, whose numbers steadily increased at the end of the 19th century. By the early 20th century the Klan\u2019s worldview helped shape the racial nativism \u2013 marked by anti-immigrant fervor, antisemitism and anti-Catholicism \u2013 that gripped the nation.</p> <p>The Klan practically joined the American mainstream during the 1920s, proudly marching by the tens of thousands in the nation\u2019s capital, their very presence giving weight to the pseudo-science of eugenics being popularized at the time.</p> <p>Fewer white hate groups dotted America\u2019s political landscape after the second world war, the result of both the success of racial segregation and the pushback from anti-racist groups during WWII\u2019s freedom surge. The 1954 Brown v Board of Ed supreme court desegregation decision resurrected these groups with a vengeance, one of the most notable being the White Citizens Councils opposing public school integration that gained traction throughout the south.</p> <p>By the late 1960s, the political energies of hate groups reached their apex in the candidacy of former Alabama governor George Wallace, who received nearly 10m popular votes as a segregationist candidate for president in 1968. And the Republican party\u2019s now infamous \u201csouthern strategy\u201d further cultivated disgruntled white voters, sometimes called \u201cDixiecrats\u201d, with naked appeals to racism.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the inheritor of this complex history, is playing a most dangerous game. His calls to \u201cmake America great again\u201d \u2013 which many view as thinly veiled code for white nationalism \u2013 has inspired millions of disgruntled and economically insecure white people, unleashing barely controlled furies that have roiled and embarrassed the nation. <br></p> <p>White Lives Matter proponents gained national attention when they <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/houston/article/White-Lives-Matter-group-protests-outside-NAACP-9176142.php\">staged a protest</a> outside of NAACP offices in Houston that prominently featured the Confederate flag. An outgrowth of a social media meme that spread among white people in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests, the group traffics in the fiction that white Americans are under assault from an onslaught of illegal immigration, reverse racism and political correctness. </p> <p>With ties to the white nationalist Aryan Front Coalition and a self-described mission to preserve the white race, White Lives Matter joins the Southern Poverty law Center\u2019s list of 892 active hate groups in the US. America\u2019s racial Pandora\u2019s box, once thought to have been closed by Obama\u2019s watershed presidential election, has been reopened with a vengeance.</p> <p>As our third consecutive summer of racial discontent comes to an end, white and black Americans remain <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/27/key-takeaways-race-and-inequality/\">split</a> over what might be called our collective racial reality. Blacks are more likely than whites to perceive racial discrimination, advocate for substantive policy changes, document unfair treatment by the criminal justice system and other institutions and to support Black Lives Matter.</p> <p>Yet these differences merely scratch the surface of the pernicious effect of groups such as White Lives Matter. Buoyed by Trump\u2019s campaign and the capitulation of mainstream Republicans, groups like White Lives Matter have helped anti-black racism to once again be normalized. And its activists form the latest beachhead in the racial archipelago that contours a nation that twice voted overwhelmingly to elect a black president.</p> <p>The devastating takeaway from allegations of reverse racism, the promotion of the Confederate flag and the demonization of Black Lives Matter is the surreal picture by many aggrieved whites that they are the most discriminated-against group in America. </p> <p>Even as social economic indicators reveal the exact opposite, the racial grievances and resentment emanating from such hate groups have successfully captured the imagination of a sizeable portion of the American electorate. White Lives Matter\u2019s designation as a hate group confirms what we already knew about not just one organization, but the iconic demagogue who has breathed life into racial furies that we recently thought were facing extinction. </p>",
  "<p>In the stories the US tells itself and the world, the cowboy is a symbol of white freedom, independence and power. He is the frontiersman taming \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans (the Lone Ranger), the politician riding in on a horse to save a nation slouching towards multiculturalism and debauchery (Ronald Reagan), the oppressed cattle herdsman who fights the federal government in armed combat to avoid paying taxes (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoff\">Cliven Bundy</a>), and the movie star who will speak truth to power about \u201cPC culture\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/03/clint-eastwood-donald-trump-racism-esquire-interview\">Clint Eastwood</a>).</p> <p>So it feels highly unusual to see black men and women riding horses as confidently as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041030/\">Hopalong Cassidy</a> in the new photography book <a href=\"http://robbinsbecher.com/projects/black-cowboys/\">Black Cowboys</a> by Andrea Robbins and Max Becher.

Hollywood filmgoers have occasionally seen black actors appear as cowboys, including Cleavon Little in Blazing Saddles (1974), Morgan Freeman in Unforgiven (1992), and Jamie Foxx in Django Unchained (2012).

  "<p>Minority ethnic political candidates face an \u201celectoral penalty\u201d of four points when they stand in areas with large numbers of white voters, according to a study which suggests the trend is being driven primarily by discrimination.</p> <p>Research has found that aspiring politicians who are Muslim face the biggest negative impact, with an eight-point disadvantage at the ballot box.</p> <p>Stephen Fisher, an associate professor at the University of Oxford\u2019s department of sociology, who carried out the research, said that even when all other factors that might depress the vote were taken into account, the race issue still existed.</p> <p>\u201cIf you control for everything you\u2019ve got and you can\u2019t think of anything else that can explain it away then it starts to look like pure prejudice,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe one thing that I did link it to was anti-immigration sentiment,\u201d he added, warning that measuring prejudice was difficult to do.</p> <p>Fisher\u2019s research is being unveiled in More Sex, Lies and the Ballot Box, a book about elections that has been edited by leading psephologists Philip Cowley and Robert Ford. </p> <p>\u201cSurveys have shown a decline in the numbers of people admitting to racial prejudice \u2013 so if they are telling the truth, we should expect people to vote in a less racist way than in the past,\u201d writes Fisher, in a chapter titled Racism at the Ballot Box: Ethnic Minority Candidates.</p> <p>To address the question he first looked in detail at the 2010 election result because it included large surveys of voters in seats with BME (black and minority ethnic) candidates.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you analyse this data you find that ethnic minority candidates suffered an average electoral penalty of about four points at the hands of white voters. But not all ethnic minority candidates are equally discriminated against \u2013 and not all white voters engage in racial discrimination at the ballot box,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>\u201cMuslim candidates were particularly likely to be discriminated against, by the three-quarters of white voters who expressed negative feelings about immigration. This Islamophobia at the ballot box accounts for just over half of the overall ethnic electoral penalty.\u201d</p> <p>The research, which highlighted a similar trend in 2015, concluded that it was a puzzle why the decline in racism over time had not translated into a drop in the BME electoral penalty.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is clear that racial discrimination remains a problem at the ballot box as in other walks of life,\u201d Fisher adds in the chapter. <br></p> <p>The academic found that BME candidates were not penalised in more diverse areas, but with the exception of Pakistani voters and candidates there was no automatic bonus either. </p> <p>In areas with large numbers of BME voters, the bigger draw was towards Labour, something that the party has tried to take advantage of, Fisher says. </p> <p>\u201cBy contrast, in seeking to modernise and diversify his party, David Cameron\u2019s only choice was to place ethnic minority candidates in overwhelmingly white areas and suffer the electoral penalty because (some) white voters, and not just Conservatives, still prefer their MPs to be white,\u201d he adds. </p> <p>Some BME candidates have said they face difficulties being selected in areas with large white populations because members fear the impact it will have on the election results.</p> <p>However, Fisher argued that it was important for parties to act on the revelations, and to remember that four points was a relatively small margin that would not lose them a seat in the vast majority of cases. He said voters were still much more likely to be swayed by the party they would like to vote for, its leader and policies.</p> <p>He pointed to the way the Conservatives had placed Rishi Sunak in William Hague\u2019s constituency of Richmond, North Yorkshire, which remained an ultra-safe Conservative seat even after a drop in the majority. </p> <p>Amina Lone, co-director of the the Social Action &amp; Research foundation, who stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Morecambe and Lunesdale in 2015, said there was an \u201cunwritten, unspeakable cultural thinking that you must align candidates to the demographics that they represent\u201d.</p> <p>She argued that it made sense at one level, but only affected BME candidates. \u201cHowever, white candidates can represent any constituency. So what happens is you ghettoise the communities, you ghettoise the candidates and it plays into identity politics.\u201d</p> <p>Lone said her experience bucked the trend as she had been chosen in an overwhelmingly white area, and she does not believe race was a deciding factor in the community. However, she said the Conservatives had been better in recent years at avoiding stereotyping candidates.</p> <p>\u201cI would say that its offensive to all communities \u2013 it stigmatises white communities by saying there is an inherent racism, and it stigmatises candidates based on their ethnicity rather than their ability to represent their party.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>",
  "<p>\u201cWe are cleaning the house now\u201d, says Celso Correia. The young, smartly-dressed, minister for land, environment and rural development in Mozambique is talking about the corruption and illegal logging that has dogged the southern African country\u2019s timber sector for more than a decade.<br></p> <p>As recently as 2013, a remarkable 93% of all the logging taking place in the country was happening illegally, according to <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/chinas-illegal-timber-imports-ransack-mozambiques-forests\" rel=\"nofollow\">a report</a> from the nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). </p> <p>As well as leading to unsustainable levels of deforestation, the export of illegally logged timber was also depriving the country of <a href=\" https://eia-international.org/wp-content/uploads/First-Class-Crisis-English-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">tens of millions of dollars</a> a year in lost tax revenue.</p> <p>The driving force behind this boom in illegal logging was China, the biggest importer of logs in the world.

A total of 35 logging licences created a huge circle of harvested land around the reserve boundary for the 2,980km squared of protected area. After years of logging in the country, the reserve is the last area where Pau Ferro, a highly sought-after wood, still exists in Mozambique.</p> <p>Gile National Reserve attracts few tourists but an alarming number of illegal loggers, according to the warden Jose Dias. Since 2012, his team has captured a total of 58 trucks and 10 tractors packed with Pau Ferro from the reserve.

I don\u2019t know if that played a part but it was dropped soon after.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/aug/31/parliament-back-in-business-with-abcc-18c-and-marriage-equality-debate-politics-live\">Labor moves to establish banking royal commission \u2013 politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones blasted his colleagues for launching an identity politics frolic when the government needed all MPs to knuckle down on the government\u2019s policy agenda.</p> <p>\u201cHow many of these men from my party had their seats in jeopardy during the election? This is what gives me the shits,\u201d Jones said.</p> <p>\u201cI lost my seat. It is a marginal seat and I know the risks. But I never freelanced or pushed my own personal agenda. Neither did Wyatt Roy, Matt Williams, Russell Matheson, or Natasha Griggs.</p> <p>\u201cYet here we have a bunch of men in the Senate, many of whom were elected at about 10 past six on election night, pushing personal agendas while the government needs them to work at getting its agenda through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think 18C is a croc but I am a white Anglo-Saxon male who has never been discriminated against on anything. No joke starts with \u2018two Wasp men walk into a bar\u2019 because we are the ones who offend people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have kept my mouth shut since the campaign and losing my seat but I am yet to see any of these men sit down with Ken Wyatt, Lisa Singh, Ed Husic, or any other ethnic representation inside the house and have that chat.\u201d</p> <p>He said his former colleagues in the Senate have the best resources on the subject of racial discrimination that they could possibly find in Wyatt \u201cbut, apart from Dean Smith, I don\u2019t reckon any of those people would have spoken to him\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI believe that RDA case at QUT should be thrown out with prejudice but I was not there and I have not spoken to the people concerned. My bet is that none of these people have either.\u201d</p> <p>Jones lost his Queensland seat of Herbert to Labor\u2019s Cathy O\u2019Toole and the One Nation candidate, Geoff Virgo, secured 13.5% of the local vote. It is not yet clear whether the Liberal party will take the result in Herbert to the court of disputed returns.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/cory-bernardis-racial-discrimination-revolt-supported-by-up-to-20-senators\">As revealed by Guardian Australia on Tuesday,</a> 20 senators are backing a push by the Liberal senator Cory Bernardi to remove the words \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201coffend\u201d from the Racial Discrimination Act, including every Liberal and National backbencher in the upper house, bar one.</p> <p>The break-out at the opening of the 45th parliament defies an exhortation by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for government MPs and the non-government forces in the parliament to focus on the economy and budget repair.</p> <p>The prime minister on Wednesday said he was not distracted by the renewed RDA debate within his own ranks. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the economy, I\u2019m talking about the ABCC, I\u2019m talking about savings, I\u2019m talking about the moral challenge that we have to get our budget back into shape,\u201d Turnbull told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. </p> <p>\u201cThe issue of section 18C has been a controversial one for a long time, and there are many views expressed about it, and there\u2019s nothing new that is being canvassed at the moment in terms of the debate,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s filled the op-ed pages of newspapers for years and years but the government has no plans to make any changes to section 18C. We have other more pressing, much more pressing priorities to address.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/31/malcolm-turnbull-says-coalition-will-negotiate-on-abcc-bill\">Malcolm Turnbull says Coalition will negotiate on ABCC bill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The conservative senator Eric Abetz, who is one of the signatories on the Bernardi motion to bring on consideration of the private senator\u2019s bill to water down the RDA, and a constant critic of the prime minister since he was dumped from the cabinet, said the RDA push was not about undermining Turnbull\u2019s authority.</p> <p>\u201cThis sort of industry of taking offence at everything has gone far too far within our society,\u201d Abetz told the ABC. \u201cFreedom of speech does require the capacity of people to engage in robust discussion \u2013 do we want vilification? Absolutely not. And that is not what\u2019s being suggested.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been suggested is that these very subjective terms such as insulting or offending, that somehow I take offence and therefore you should not be allowed to say what is on your mind, that stifles free speech.\u201d</p> <p>Bernardi\u2019s private senator\u2019s bill is on Wednesday\u2019s notice paper for consideration in the Senate.</p>"
