  "<p>If the world seems slightly edgier today, it\u2019s probably because Vice has its own TV channel now. As of 6am, Viceland has set out to challenge everything you know about stuff you\u2019re too old to care about in a borderline self-parodic way.</p> <p>Should you watch Viceland? Yes, you should, because it has some very good television programmes. Should you watch Viceland all the time? Oh, Christ, no, you should absolutely not, because Viceland is also studded with the sort of self-conscious yoof-hipster dreck that you hoped had died long ago. Here are six of the best shows you can expect, and six to throw into a metal dustbin and incinerate.</p> <h2>WATCH</h2> <p><strong>Black Market With Michael K Williams</strong> </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0Z9Uz_EMHo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w0Z9Uz_EMHo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Viceland\u2019s answer to Ross Kemp: Extreme World, this follows Omar from The Wire as he ventures deep into squalor. He meets joyriders, poachers, gunrunners, gamblers and drug addicts in this documentary series, filtering the experiences through the trauma of his own life. He\u2019s a great, empathetic interview, and this works beautifully.</p> <p><strong>Fuck That\u2019s Delicious</strong> </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4M4MJsohyY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p4M4MJsohyY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>If Viceland deserves to have a breakout star, it\u2019s Action Bronson. And this deserves to be his breakout show. Fuck That\u2019s Delicious follows Bronson as he travels the world rapping, cooking and eating. And he is truly engaging; simultaneously funny and knowledgable and honest. He\u2019s the new Anthony Bourdain. Honestly, this show is amazing.</p> <p><strong>Gaycation</strong><br></p> <p>Godawful title aside, Gaycation follows Ellen Page and Ian Daniel as they embark upon an LGBT travelogue. They meet people, they immerse themselves in the culture, they try to come to terms with the differing ways in which the gay community are treated in different regions. Gaycation is occasionally a little too worthy for its own good, but this is exactly the sort of show Viceland should be making. </p> <p><strong>Dead Set on Life</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfaTNlCIyU8\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZfaTNlCIyU8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Viceland\u2019s dirty secret is that when it calms down and stops trying so hard, it\u2019s actually one of the very best food channels on TV. As well as That\u2019s Delicious, there\u2019s Dead Set on Life, which is worth as much time as you can possibly give it. Again, it\u2019s a show about travelling the world and eating food, but chef Matty Matheson is charm personified. If Action Bronson is your fun uncle, Matheson is a giddy little boy who can\u2019t believe his luck. A great show.</p> <p><strong>Party Legends<br></strong>After careful consideration, I have dragged Party Legends out of the \u201cavoid\u201d pile. For the longest time I was convinced that\u2019s where it should live \u2013 the entire show is just celebrities telling a succession of crazy party stories, which is about as self-involved as you can get \u2013 but I\u2019ve had a change of heart. This is for two reasons. The first is its impressive calibre of talent \u2013 Fred Armisen, Margaret Cho, Eric Andre and TJ Miller all appear \u2013 and the second is that their stories are animated, which stops things from getting too unbearably tedious. It\u2019s Drunk History for hipsters, essentially.</p> <h2>AVOID</h2> <p><strong>NOISEY </strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMmqgJcMNO4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AMmqgJcMNO4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This is probably what you imagined when you heard about Viceland \u2013 endless slow-motion footage of people dancing, accompanied by tracts of mumbled faux-profundity by vapid gits in baseball caps. Watching it feels like accidentally wandering into a clothes shop you\u2019re five years too young for and being hectored about EDM by a checkout girl who lists her profession as DJ on Twitter.</p> <p><strong>Hate Thy Neighbour<br></strong>Remember on Seinfeld, where the themes of each episode would culminate in a brief standup set from Jerry Seinfeld? Hate Thy Neighbour is similar to that, except every episode is about meeting an extremist group of some description. It\u2019s a show for people who enjoy their comedy interspersed with moments of tonally jarring racism. Which is nobody. This show is for nobody.</p> <p><strong>Needles and Pins</strong><br>Because Viceland is a cable television channel in the year 2016, it\u2019s duty-bound to include a documentary series about tattoos. Only this is Viceland, so this one walks an uncomfortable line between too hip and too earnest. Still, if it takes off, Viceland might start making versions of other threadbare cable television formats. I wonder what its version of Storage Wars is going to be like.</p> <p><strong>Weediquette</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzqDZA6EVDI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TzqDZA6EVDI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>I might have given Gaycation a pass for its terrible title, but I have to draw the line somewhere. And I\u2019m doing it with Weediquette, because that\u2019s barely even a pun. If this was a show about propulsion engines, I could live with Jetiquette. If it was about millinery, I could live with Hatiquette. But Weediquette doesn\u2019t work on any level. It is the single most dismal name for a television show in the entire history of the medium. Still, it fills Viceland\u2019s quota for cannabis coverage.</p> <p><strong>Bong Appetit</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSDc7_mWIXo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CSDc7_mWIXo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Except it doesn\u2019t, because almost every other show on Viceland is about cannabis. You know when you\u2019re at a party, and there\u2019s someone there who\u2019s a vegetarian or likes golf or whatever, and you ask them about it because you don\u2019t know what else to talk about, and they drone on and on about why meat is bad or golf is good or whatever, and then they get out their phone and start backing up their pointless drone with evidence, and you want to go upstairs and hit the side of your head on a basin until you die? Viceland is this, but about pot.

  "<h2>La La Land is a major contender</h2> <p>Since it world-premiered as the opening night film of the Venice film festival, Damien Chazelle\u2019s big hearted love letter to Los Angeles has continued to buzz as a major awards contender. Reviews were largely glowing out of the gate (in Venice, The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw declared it a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/31/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone\">sun-drenched musical masterpiece</a>\u201d). Even Tom Hanks, an Academy member, is a fan: while attending the Telluride film festival, he acted as La La Land\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/08/damien-chazelle-la-la-land-interview-toronto-film-festival-tiff-venice-telluride\"> unofficial mascot</a>, when he was supposed to be touting his performance in Clint Eastwood\u2019s Sully. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/18/why-hollywood-musical-la-la-land-will-follow-argo-and-the-artist-to-the-oscars\">Why Hollywood musical La La Land will follow Argo and The Artist to the Oscars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>La La Land cemented its status as the major breakout this festival season with Sunday\u2019s win of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/18/la-la-land-tipped-for-oscars-glory-after-win-at-toronto-film-festival\">Toronto\u2019s People\u2019s Choice award</a> which, while decided by cinemagoers, has become a reliable indicator of Oscar glory. Previous winners have included American Beauty, Silver Linings Playbook, The King\u2019s Speech, Slumdog Millionaire, 12 Years a Slave, Precious and last year\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/room-review-brie-larson-shines-in-a-dark-dungeon\">Room</a>, which went on to score a surprise four nominations at the Oscars and a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/29/brie-larson-wins-best-actress-oscar-for-room\">best actress win for Brie Larson.</a><br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Academy has been known to love films about its own industry, and in that regard, La La Land fits the bill. Emma Stone plays a struggling actor, whose relationship with her jazz pianist boyfriend (Ryan Gosling) becomes strained when his career begins to overtake hers. Chazelle\u2019s swooning execution makes it the most audacious ode to Hollywood since The Artist, which swept to success in 2012. It\u2019s still early to gauge if La La Land will follow in that silent film\u2019s footsteps. So far, the chances appear to be in its favour. </p> <h2>The best actress race is stacked</h2> <p>Out of La La Land\u2019s lovesick pair, Stone has emerged as the MVP. She anchors the film as the feisty Mia, showcasing all of her best assets as an actor: she\u2019s wry when the script calls for it, devastating in a final number, and altogether charming. It\u2019s a winning performance \u2013 and the best of her already impressive career. </p> <p>Stone beat Natalie Portman (<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/13/jackie-review-natalie-portman-kennedy-jfk\">who\u2019s also drawing her best-ever reviews for her terrific portrayal of Jacqueline Kennedy</a> in Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s Jackie) for best actress honours at Venice. But as potential Oscar narratives go, the two are being pegged as this year\u2019s major rivals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1052814bc4db40b78709389df49e9a175a128244\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1052814bc4db40b78709389df49e9a175a128244/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie Portman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy in Jackie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Portman hasn\u2019t acted much since winning her Oscar for Black Swan in 2011. She proves that victory was no fluke with a galvanising turn as Kennedy immediately before and following John F Kennedy\u2019s assassination, that\u2019s sure to impress voters for its technical proficiency (Portman thoroughly nails Kennedy\u2019s breathy and docile-sounding voice, without letting the affectations get the better of her), while also appealing to their emotions. </p> <p>The two aren\u2019t the only to impress this season. Rebecca Hall did a victory lap in Toronto months after debuting her dark character Christine in Sundance. Hall is fearless as Christine Chubbuck, the news anchor who achieved notoriety in the 70s for killing herself on live TV. The filmwill probably prove too grim to factor strongly into the discussion, but Hall deserves a major shot. The same goes for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/una-review-rooney-mara-and-ben-mendelsohn-child-abuse-drama-is-stagey-disappointment\">Rooney Mara in Una</a>. The two-hander about a confrontation between a woman and the man who sexually abused her as a child didn\u2019t set Toronto aflame. Her performance, however, is too charged to ignore. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/22/rebecca-hall-accused-of-cashing-in-by-brother-christine-chubbuck\">Christine, film about presenter's on-air suicide, is 'cashing in' says brother</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Amy Adams meanwhile had a fabulous week, earning major plaudits for her varied work in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s brainy sci-fi Arrival and Tom Ford\u2019s sleek thriller Nocturnal Animals. She\u2019s sure to have a busy few months ahead.<br></p> <h2>The Birth of a Nation is still on shaky ground</h2> <p>Nate Parker\u2019s The Birth of a Nation entered Toronto so clouded in controversy it probably never stood a chance of reclaiming the glory of its Sundance debut, where it sold to Fox Searchlight for a record sum and ignited Oscar buzz as the film that would combat recent #OscarsSoWhite controversy at next year\u2019s ceremony.</p> <p>For a moment, however, the Nat Turner biopic seemed poised to come close. Similar to Sundance, The Birth of a Nation was greeted by a lengthy standing ovation in Toronto, even amid the rape allegations that have threatened to derail the film\u2019s chances of entering the awards race. </p> <p>Everything appeared to be going so smoothly \u2013 that was until Parker took part in a press conference following its rapturous screening, where<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/nate-parker-deflects-allegation-question-promoting-birth-of-a-nation-in-toronto\"> he uncomfortably chose to evade any questions regarding the 17-year-old case</a>. Ultimately for Parker, there\u2019s no escaping his past.</p> <h2>Moonlight is soaring</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/its-impossible-to-be-vulnerable-how-moonlight-reflects-being-a-black-gay-man-in-the-us\">\u2018It\u2019s impossible to be vulnerable\u2019: how Moonlight reflects being a black gay man in the US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With The Birth of a Nation floundering, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Barry Jenkins\u2019s Moonlight </a>stands to become the needed lighting rod to put an end to #OscarsSoWhite. It\u2019s a tougher overall sell: it tells a micro story, focusing on a black gay man at three stages over his life. But ecstatic reviews prove it\u2019s a hit with discerning audiences. There\u2019s no denying its power.</p> <h2>Harvey Weinstein is back in the mix</h2> <p>The producer, once considered the king of awards season, has in recent years been flailing a bit. Last year, he failed to earn Todd Haynes\u2019s Carol a best picture nomination. In fact, no films from his company made the cut in a major blow for Weinstein, who hasn\u2019t seen a film from his company net the industry\u2019s biggest honour since The Artist.</p> <p>By all accounts, Garth Davis\u2019s directorial debut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/lion-review-dev-patel-and-nicole-kidman-hunt-oscars-in-moving-adoption-drama\">Lion</a> will bring Weinstein back into the fold. The Academy gravitates towards inspirational and fact-based stories, and Lion has a great one: Dev Patel plays a young man adopted as a child who uses Google Maps to track down the family he left in India. The film generated a prolonged ovation at its premiere, as well as enthusiastic reviews from critics usually immune to such tales. It proved its hold by coming in as the runner-up for the People\u2019s Choice award. If Weinstein plays his cards right, he\u2019ll be back on terra firma in no time.</p>",
