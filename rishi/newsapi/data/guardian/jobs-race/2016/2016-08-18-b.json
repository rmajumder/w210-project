  "<p>Set in Brussels, this modern-day Romeo and Juliet story unfolds the tale of a doomed romance between Marwan (Aboubakr Bensaihi) and Mavela (Martha Canga Antonio), young lovers whose families come from north and sub-Saharan Africa, respectively, and who belong to rival gangs. </p> <p>There\u2019s a lot to admire, from the honesty about the brutality of gang culture, its pungent sense of place and the vitality of its young cast. With her breathy Betty Boop voice and impressive dramatic range, Canga Antonio represents a particular discovery here. I long to see her cast in a female buddy movie with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/26/girlhood-film-karidja-toure-assa-sylla-celine-sciamma\">Karidja Tour\u00e9</a>, the star of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/girlhood-review-celine-sciamma-karidja-toure\">Girlhood</a>, perhaps in a Francophone urban remake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/26/thelma-louise-french-classic-dvd\">Thelma and Louise</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef43856981e69500ccfc96219c55a5a724d60d66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef43856981e69500ccfc96219c55a5a724d60d66/340_0_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A particular discovery \u2026 Martha Canga Antonio</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Voets/PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the hip-hop video aesthetic, all self-consciously choppy editing and lapidary lighting, is a bit obnoxious sometimes, especially when it seems to prettify sexual violence, and the ending couldn\u2019t be more predictable.

  "<p>In the five years since Germany overtook Italy in Uefa\u2019s rankings, stealing a Champions League berth away from clubs on the peninsula, pundits have pontificated at length on the lessons that Serie A might learn from the Bundesliga. Many have called for a greater focus on youth and homegrown talent, as well as the construction of stadiums.</p> <p>Juventus were ahead on both fronts, and have reaped the rewards as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/apr/26/juventus-enjoy-improbable-march-to-success-and-lift-fifth-successive-serie-a-title\" title=\"\">they romped to five consecutive Scudetti</a> but 2016 may go down as the year when they took the Teutonic template a step further. Instead of drawing inspiration from Germany\u2019s top division, the <em>Bianconeri</em> now appear to simply be imitating Germany\u2019s top club.</p> <p>In a move straight from the Bayern Munich playbook, Juventus entrenched their domestic dominance this summer by prising star players away from their two closest rivals. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/26/gonzalo-higuain-moves-napoli-juventus\" title=\"\">From Napoli, they took Gonzalo Higua\u00edn</a> \u2013 fresh from the most prolific season in Serie A history. <a href=\"]\" title=\"\">From Roma, they took Miralem Pjanic</a> \u2013 whose 12 assists were joint-most in the league last season.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jul/27/crazy-transfer-fee-gonzalo-higuain-theatre-absurd-football\" title=\"\">Perhaps Juventus overpaid for Higua\u00edn</a>. The decision to invest \u20ac90m in a player who will turn 29 before Christmas already looked a little reckless before he showed up for pre-season <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/aug/12/gonzalo-higuain-football-fans-overweight-players-argentina-juventus\" title=\"\">looking decidedly doughy around his midsection</a>.</p> <p>Even when he does get up to full speed, awkward questions will remain about where Higua\u00edn fits into Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s tactics. The Argentinian has done his best work as the central striker in a 4-3-3 but to accommodate him there would require shifting Paulo Dybala \u2013 coming off a brilliant first season as the deeper-lying forward in Juventus\u2019s two-man attack \u2013 out to the wing.</p> <p>Pjanic, by contrast, was a steal at \u20ac32m and should go a long way toward filling the creative void <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\" title=\"\">left by Paul Pogba\u2019s departure</a>.

Napoli\u2019s newly acquired alternative, the 22-year-old Poland striker Arkadiusz Milik, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/12/poland-northern-ireland-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">is not too shabby either</a>.</p> <p>The <em>Partenopei</em> are expected to make further additions but their prospects of challenging Juventus will rest more heavily on their ability to keep hold of the players they already have. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/10/chelsea-target-kalidou-koulibalys-future-to-be-resolved-this-week\" title=\"\">Kalidou Koulibaly</a> and Lorenzo Insigne were key figures in the run to second place last season but both are said to be disgruntled over the club\u2019s failure to offer them improved contracts, and each has plenty of admirers at home and abroad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bddcb6d71abf95e2da7a8e152f999ebd0891a8a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bddcb6d71abf95e2da7a8e152f999ebd0891a8a1/185_328_2662_1597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Inter manager Frank de Boer and his players stroll the streets of Limerick before the friendly against Brendan Rogers\u2019 Celtic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Inter manager Frank de Boer and his players stroll the streets of Limerick before the friendly against Brendan Rogers\u2019 Celtic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Villa - Inter/Inter via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roma, third last season, have needed to run just to stand still this summer, using a large chunk of their transfer budget to convert loanees such as Mohamed Salah and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/27/stephan-el-shaarawy-loan-roma-milan\" title=\"\">Stephan El Shaarawy into permanent signings</a>. Unfortunately, they were not able to work the same magic on Lucas Digne, who returned to Paris Saint-Germain before signing for Barcelona.</p> <p>It is not entirely clear how the left-back will be replaced. The summer arrivals Juan Jesus and Thomas Vermaelen have each played the position but lack the pace to get forward and overlap with Roma\u2019s flying wingers as Digne did. Bruno Peres, an astute addition from Torino, can bring an equivalent energy to the opposite flank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/08/alessandro-florenzi-italy-versatile-giallorosso-euro-2016\" title=\"\">but where does that leave Alessandro Florenzi?</a></p> <p>If nothing else, Roma have options. And although they have lost one world-class midfielder in Pjanic, the hope is they may be about to rediscover another one \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/23/kevin-strootman-surgery-roma-former-doctor-manchester-united-target\" title=\"\">Kevin Strootman back at last from the knee injury</a> and complications that kept him off the pitch for the best part of two years.</p> <p>Are there any other teams capable of competing for the title? What about De Boer\u2019s Inter?

The Italian press have noted the owners\u2019 close relationship with Kia Joorabchian \u2013 the agent to Carlos Tevez \u2013 with whom Mancini did not exactly see eye-to-eye in his Manchester City days. It has not escaped the attention that both De Boer and Inter\u2019s top remaining transfer target, Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio, is also represented by Joorabchian.</p> <p>Whatever the circumstances, the Dutchman has inherited a squad of significant potential. It is easy to forget Inter were top of the table last Christmas and had room for growth this season even before any signings were made. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/22/internazionale-sign-geoffrey-kondogbia-monaco\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Kondogbia is 23</a> and should improve with a year of Serie A experience under his belt.

At least, with no European competition to distract them, Milan can put all of their energies into improving on their seventh place.</p> <p>Sassuolo, who pipped them to Italy\u2019s final Europa League berth, may find it tricky to repeat such an achievement with Sime Vrsaljko and Nicola Sansone having departed. At least they have held on to Domenico Berardi.</p> <p>Elsewhere fascinating sub-plots abound. Can tiny Crotone succeed where Carpi and Frosinone failed by extending their first top-flight jaunt beyond one season?

  "<p>In my city neighbourhood this summer a man on the run from police custody hit a black woman in the face. Understandably, she reported it as a racial attack. Except it probably wasn\u2019t. The runaway also hit a boy when his mother opened the door and tried to spray another woman\u2019s hair red at a bus stop. He had mental health problems.</p> <p>Not much harm done in this instance. But it\u2019s one reason why I don\u2019t often write about race relations in modern Britain, though I first did so 50 years ago when many aspects of them were pretty grim. </p> <p>As a local reporter in Reading I had a walk-on part in black radical <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_X\">Michael X\u2019s</a> 1967 speech in the town, the one which led to an incitement conviction under Roy Jenkins\u2019s farsighted new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_Relations_Act_1965\">Race Relations Act</a>. On the night of Enoch Powell\u2019s shameful \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech \u2013 his Tory leadership bid \u2013 in 1968 I was with members of a black family who were working to make things better.</p> <p>Since then we\u2019ve come an unimaginably long way towards a diverse and mostly tolerant multicultural society, as you can see on most streets of Britain most of the time \u2013 though not always on all of them. It\u2019s an ongoing project and it\u2019s wise to weigh progress made against evidence of persistent disadvantage. But, as with that west London runaway. it\u2019s rarely as straightforward, as some professional monitors (I dislike the phrase \u201crace relations industry\u201d) routinely assert.</p> <p>So I heard news of Thursday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/18/human-rights-watchdog-urgent-action-deep-rooted-inequality\">report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> with a wary interest. The EHRC\u2019s new chairman, David Isaac, popped up on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme to sound pretty sensible, though I didn\u2019t think his link between enduring racial prejudice and the Brexit vote was politically very smart. Nor his sideswipe against Theresa May and the dangers of \u201cone-nation platitudes\u201d in her debut statement as our new PM.</p> <p>Why not? Well, like it or not (Isaac is <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-3533172/Why-Nicky-Morgan-pickle-appointment-David-Isaac-quango-job.html\">apparently a Labour-voting</a> kind of \u00a3500,000-a-year City lawyer), May is going to be in charge and directing policy for a while. So there\u2019s no point in offending her just to show you\u2019re a tough guy even though you wear a tie. If previous efforts to address race inequality have been \u201cpiecemeal and stuttering\u201d \u2013 as Isaac asserted \u2013 they have also been sustained and serious.</p> <p>As for that Brexit link, it needlessly puts hackles up among 52% of those who voted in the referendum. Some Brexit voters may nurture varying degrees of animosity towards migrants, but not most of them. We are told that xenophobic attacks have risen since 23 June. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s right. But some Brexiteers also feel persecuted by righteous remains (there is talk of a court case). Confirmation bias will be part of the story on both sides.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the EHRC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/race-report-healing-divided-britain\">full report</a>. No, I haven\u2019t read it yet either (strictly speaking, it applies to England and Wales only), but here\u2019s its own <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/widespread-inequality-risks-increasing-race-tensions-warns-ehrc \">executive summary</a> for faint hearts. As you can see, it highlights familiar problems.</p> <p>Black people are both more likely to be victims of crime and to be harshly treated by the criminal justice system. A similar picture exists in the jobs market; even black graduates are paid an estimated 23% less than comparable white ones. Being young and looking for work has been tough in the austerity years, being black as well is tougher.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not that binary an issue. Those of Chinese and Indian heritage are doing well in terms of school success and exam results, better than the white British in some instances. </p> <p>Falling behind newcomers in the prosperity stakes must be galling for those falling behind. It\u2019s part of the Brexit mix, directed as much against Poles, white, Christian and European, as against black or Asian migrants. Enoch didn\u2019t spot that either, though his frequent emphasis on sheer <em>numbers</em> has come to prove significant this decade.</p> <p>My core point remains that class and culture are usually more important underlying determinants in many of these points of friction or distress. I think that\u2019s part of what Isaac\u2019s predecessor in the old Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) Trevor Phillips keeps trying to flag up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/22/black-asian-minority-ethnic-bame-bme-trevor-phillips-racial-minorities\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4446683.ece\">here</a> (paywall) and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/10/britain-sleepwalking-to-catastrophe-over-race-trevor-phillips/\">here</a>.</p> <p>Thus white women report almost twice the level of domestic abuse that BME women report, though some of the latter group carry the heavier burden of FGM, \u201chonour\u201d killing and forced marriage. </p> <p>Identity politics of race, gender, sexuality, disability have all grown in salience in recent years, as old-fashioned class politics have been corroded by manageralism and the demise of cold war polemics. </p> <p>But the popularity of Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders, Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump too in their own way, serves to remind us all that class-based exclusion from many of life\u2019s good things and consequent resentments are also potent and real. Thursday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/live/2016/aug/18/a-level-results-day-2016-uk-students-get-their-grades-live\">A-level results tell a more complicated story</a>, as does new data on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/18/gap-between-graduate-and-non-graduate-wages-shows-signs-of-waning\">graduate wage levels</a> in hard times. </p> <p>Complacency is a familiar enemy, but so is flagellation. Britain\u2019s Olympic triumphs in Rio reflect meritocratic excellence that seems to acknowledge few boundaries of class, race or gender. That\u2019s to our credit. All in all I still believe a TV-viewing nation that awards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/12/bake-off-winner-nadiya-hussain-muslims-britain\">Great British Bake Off prize to Nadiya Hussain</a> \u2013 despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/14/bake-off-winner-nadiya-hussain-racist-abuse-is-part-of-her-everyday-life \">problems she reported on Desert Island Discs</a> \u2013 is on a wiser road to mutual respect than one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/17/french-pm-supports-local-bans-burkinis\">bans the very Victorian burkini</a>. <br></p>",

However, Hollande\u2019s poor poll ratings indicate that the presidential election will be a contest between the centre-right politician and current favourite, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/04/alain-juppe-french-presidential-uk-leave-eu\">Alain Jupp\u00e9</a>, and the far-right Front National leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/20/well-done-britain-brexit-vote-boosts-french-far-right-front-national-election-machine\">Marine Le Pen</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-18T12:24:03/embed.html\" data-alt=\"French unemployment falls below 10% for first time since 2012\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-18T12:24:03/embed.html\">French unemployment falls below 10% for first time since 2012</a> </figure>  <p>Unemployment in France has declined more slowly than in most leading European economies, as a gradual recovery in economic growth and job creation is offset by the number of young people entering the labour force every year. </p> <p>The jobless rate for mainland France, excluding its overseas territories, dipped below 10% in the fourth quarter of last year and fell further to 9.6% in the three months to the end of June. The number of unemployed people dropped by 74,000 to 2.8 million.</p> <p>Unemployment was down in all age categories, but the fall in youth unemployment was sharper: it fell 0.4 points to 24.3%, the lowest since 2014. </p> <p>The percentage of long-term unemployed \u2013 those registered as out of work for more than a year \u2013 remained stable at 4.3%, however.</p> <p>Despite the fall, the French unemployment rate remains high compared with some major economies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/17/uk-unemployment-claimant-count-falls-after-brexit\">In the UK, the jobless rate is 4.9%</a>, while 4.2% of people are out of work in Germany.</p> <p>The employment rate in France was 64.7% in the second quarter, up 0.1 points on the first three months of the year. The biggest increases in employment were among young people and those aged 50 to 64.<br></p>",
  "<p>Australia\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to a three-year low after the number of people in work rose a greater than expected 26,200 in July.</p> <p>The dollar rose strongly to US77.13c, up from 76.72c on Wednesday, in a sign of renewed market confidence in the Australian economy.</p> <p>But the headline unemployment figure of 5.72% \u2013 the lowest in almost three years \u2013 masked the growing trend towards part-time working as the economy transitions from the investment-driven mining boom to a service-focused base. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jun/20/unemployment-figures-suit-turnbull-but-not-those-seeking-full-time-work\">Unemployment figures suit Turnbull, but not those seeking full-time work | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Full-time employment actually fell by 45,400 jobs in July, while the number of part-time jobs was up by 71,600. The participation rate, which refers to the number of people either employed or actively looking for work, was flat at 64.9%.</p> <p>The data also shows that 72,000 new jobs were created in the first seven months of 2016, compared with more than 150,000 in the same period last year. Full-time job creation has gone into reverse in that time by almost 65,000 compared with jobs growth of almost 90,000 in the same period last year. </p> <p>Savanth Sebastian, an economist at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/nsw-ranked-australias-strongest-economy-commsec-state-of-the-states-report\">CommSec</a>, also noted a slowdown in new jobs being advertised earlier this year, adding that the uncertainty caused by the lengthy federal election campaign could have had a dampening effect on hiring.</p> <p>\u201cThe softer results across the labour market mirror other indicators across the economy, including retail sales,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the sluggish first half of 2016 resulted in employers managing their major cost base (employees) more carefully.</p> <p>\u201cThe hope would be that now the election is out of the way consumers and businesses will go back to spending, investing and hiring \u2013 particularly given the ultra-low interest rates on offer and significant improvements in the household budget.\u201d</p> <p>In Western Australia, where the jobless rate of 6.3% is the second highest in the country behind South Australia, employment minister Michaelia Cash tried to put some positive spin on the growth in part-time jobs. \u201cI\u2019m not going to demonise part-time employment. I\u2019m going to support it and applaud it because it does represent a good choice for so many people.\u201d</p> <p>Labor\u2019s employment spokesman Brendan O\u2019Connor said almost one in 10 Australians were looking for more work but could not find it. </p>"
