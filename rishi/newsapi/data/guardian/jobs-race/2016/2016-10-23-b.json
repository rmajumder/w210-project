  "<p>Institutional racism in Britain\u2019s universities is harming the performance of minority ethnic students, the UK\u2019s first professor of black studies has said.</p> <p>Kehinde Andrews, an associate professor at Birmingham City University (BCU), told a conference last week marking Black History Month that universities are \u201cno less institutionally racist than the police\u201d, and criticised the curriculum for being overly \u201cwhite\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cUniversities produce racism,\u201d Andrews told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s only since the 1960s there have been any black or Asian people \u2013 or women \u2013 at all.\u201d In the intervening decades, little has happened to challenge ingrained attitudes and approaches, he said. \u201cAre universities producing knowledge that challenges racism? I would argue that they are not.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"60218afc3558791e005bfdecbaa415f19b6a0137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60218afc3558791e005bfdecbaa415f19b6a0137/40_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Kehinde Andrews\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Kehinde Andrews</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vimeo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year a report by the Runnymede Trust, an equalities thinktank, warned that universities had proved \u201cremarkably resilient to change in terms of curriculum, culture and staffing, remaining for the most part \u2018ivory towers\u2019 \u2212 with the emphasis on \u2018ivory\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking after his comments at the Black History Month event were reported by the Sunday Times, Andrews said there had been a persistent \u201cattainment gap\u201d between white and non-white students, even among ethnic minorities that tend to perform well at school. </p> <p>\u201cSomething\u2019s happening in those three or four years of education to institute the gap,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Three-quarters of white students achieve a 2:1 degree or higher, compared to 60% of minority ethnic students. This is the same at universities up and down the league table, he said.</p> <p>\u201cSomewhere like Oxford or Cambridge, you might expect people to feel marginalised and excluded: there\u2019s very few minority students. But actually at BCU 50% of students are ethnic minority \u2026 You might think surely it wouldn\u2019t be the same as in Cambridge. But you still have exactly the same situation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s obviously something about what\u2019s happening in the way things are organised and the way things are run \u2026 it\u2019s institutional. It\u2019s beyond an individual place or act.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/21/marlon-james-calls-for-action-on-diversity-instead-of-just-talk\">Marlon James calls for action on diversity instead of just talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrews believes the curriculum is a key factor. In his own discipline \u2013 sociology \u2013 the canon taught as the foundation of the subject is \u201ca collection of dead white men\u201d, he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the same at every university.\u201d </p> <p>He is not alone with these concerns. Last year, the National Union of Students backed a student campaign, \u201cWhy is my curriculum white\u201d, highlighting the lack of diversity in the texts assigned to students, prompting discussions within some of the UK\u2019s top universities on the issue. </p> <p>At Cambridge, academics are running a research group on \u201cdecolonising the curriculum\u201d. One of the group\u2019s organisers, African politics lecturer Adam Branch, told the Guardian that this aims to acknowledge the colonial roots of many of the institutions and approaches that make up a university. </p> <p>The decolonising approach examines how this affects universities today, \u201cfrom what texts are read, to who is admitted, employed, and promoted, to the relation between the university and the community, to what knowledge is valued and what is dismissed or ignored,\u201d Branch said.</p> <p>Andrews says that in humanities subjects, which are largely self-guided, the impact of studying authors who not only fail to interest but sometimes \u201cactually alienate\u201d students can harm their education. \u201cSo if you\u2019re reading Kant and Kant\u2019s talking about European enlightenment and talking down about Africa and the rest of the world \u2026 it\u2019s really difficult to get into that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The most glaring illustrations of racial inequality in universities is in their staffing, Andrews said: just 60 of the UK\u2019s 14,000 professors are black.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/19/students-studying-dead-white-men-women-higher-education-syllabus\">Students don\u2019t mind studying dead white men, but they want dead women too</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable it\u2019s that bad. And that\u2019s not just at redbrick universities \u2013 it\u2019s replicated across the entire sector,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Minority ethnic staff frequently experience micro-aggressions \u2013 small acts of discrimination, Andrews said. \u201cI get this all the time. In my first job I went to go to a staff part of the university and someone put their hands physically on me and pushed me out of the room \u2013 they had assumed I must be a student.\u201d</p> <p>He described how he adopts a \u201cdress code\u201d of smarter shoes and trousers whenever he goes on to campus, after persistently being questioned by security guards early in his career. \u201cIt\u2019s at the point where if I\u2019m near university dressed like I would normally dress, if I have to go into university I will always go home and get changed, just because if I don\u2019t I will get hassled,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Andrews is currently working on a paper counting how many black sociologists are permanently employed in the UK. \u201cI\u2019ve so far counted 15 \u2013 and that includes the five sociologists at BCU. Outside of BCU you\u2019re very unlikely to see a black sociologist anywhere in the UK and that must be caused by institutional racism: I don\u2019t have any other explanation,\u201d he said.</p>",

However, Paxman was on fine form, as though spraying linguistic lava from a permanently erupting volcano. \u201cThis year\u2019s presidential election has shaped up rather like a reality TV contest,\u201d he scoffed. Later, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s ascendance: \u201cMany conservatives still thought he was a spiv wearing spray-tan Republicanism.\u201d</p> <p>The documentary made a goodish fist of impartiality, with references to Hillary\u2019s emails, her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-trump-supporters--bigoted-deplorables\">deplorables</a>\u201d outburst, the fact that she\u2019s a Clinton and the embodiment of the \u201cpolitical class\u201d (\u201cHillary reeks of Washington\u201d) and everything else that apparently turns off \u201cangry white voters\u201d so much that they would rather elect a sexist, racist, narcissistic halfwit with hair like demonically possessed candyfloss and the political acumen of a deep-fried whoopee cushion.</p> <p>However, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Clinton</a>\u2019s toxicity was dealt with (some disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters prefer to vote for Trump), Paxman reserved his main scalpel cuts for a non-anaesthetised dissection of the Trump phenomenon. Washington strategist Jim Messina related how he\u2019d initially prayed for the Republican nominee to be Trump, as he\u2019d be the \u201ceasiest to beat\u201d. The irony was not lost on Paxman, who stood by the grave of the acerbic commentator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/26/biography.features\">HL Mencken</a>, paraphrasing his line: \u201cOn some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart\u2019s desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.\u201d Quite. And, if the most recent televised debate is anything to go by, a \u201cdownright moron\u201d who will not necessarily accept a losing result.</p> <p>The documentary ended as it began, with America poised on a slippery, unedifying electoral precipice, being jabbed urgently with a comedy stick with a boxing glove stuck on the end, perchance with ashen-faced British viewers feebly wailing at the screen: \u201cDon\u2019t do it, America, don\u2019t be as stupid as we were!\u201d At least there was amusement in Paxman\u2019s (post-\u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d) interview with Trump\u2019s new bestie, Nigel Farage. Farage backed away from Trump so fast that if smell-o-vision had been available, my living room would have been filled with the stench of burning rubber.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4682bcde415fbaf5e82593bb117dff3b656ff1cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4682bcde415fbaf5e82593bb117dff3b656ff1cc/0_159_2005_1203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cast of \u2018whip-smart\u2019 US sitcom Black-ish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of \u2018whip-smart\u2019 US sitcom Black-ish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC/ Disney</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the US award-winning sitcom <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/black-ish\"><strong>Black-ish</strong></a><strong> </strong> was first broadcast in 2014, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/517293224831234048?lang=en\">Trump tweeted</a>: \u201cCan you imagine the furor [sic] of a show [called] \u2018Whiteish\u2019!

We\u2019ll have to get back to Trump on that one.</p> <p>Now being aired here week-nightly on E4, from the pilot episode onwards, <em>Black-ish</em>, created by Kenya Barris, more than deserves its reputation as the funny show that tackles race issues head on. Anthony Anderson plays Dre Johnson, father of an upper-middle-class black family, with a mixed-race doctor wife, Rainbow, played by Tracee Ellis Ross (\u201cI\u2019m not really black? Could somebody tell my hair and my ass?\u201d), deadpan grandad, played by Laurence Fishburne (\u201cI can smell a group hug coming on\u201d), and the requisite brood of cute, wisecracking kids.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps the curse of the pharaohs still lingers because the dialogue in Tutankhamun was shocking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect (a black <em>Modern Family</em>?), but <em>Black-ish</em>\u2019s strengths soon emerged in its confident vision, whip-smart writing and knowing absurdist flourishes, such as a sightseeing tour driving past the Anderson abode: \u201cIf you look to your left, you\u2019ll see the mythical and majestic black family, out of their natural habitat and yet still thriving.\u201d</p> <p>Later episodes will deal with everything from racist language to police brutality, but the pilot mainly focused on the challenges of the family\u2019s blended (black-ish) reality. Pilot episodes can be clunky, and <em>Black-ish</em> was no exception, with an overzealous \u201con-message\u201d feel. However, by the second episode it was hitting its stride, with a defiantly silly parental sex talk theme. Meanwhile, grandad advised his eldest granddaughter about some peer group problems, later telling Rainbow: \u201cI listened to her, gave her some generic advice in a deep soothing voice \u2013 I \u2018Morgan Freeman-ed\u2019 her.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.itv.com/hub/tutankhamun/2a3150a0001\"><strong>Tutankhamun</strong></a> appears to have been conceived for the ITV Sunday night slot still haunted by the ratings ghost of <em>Downton Abbey</em>. There\u2019s even a <em>Downton</em> link in that Sam Neill plays the fifth Earl of Carnarvon (of Highclere Castle, where <em>Downton</em> was filmed), the patron of Howard Carter (Max Irons), who\u2019s hunting for the Egyptian boy king\u2019s final resting place as the first world war breaks out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"111ad911cf888072558dfea6131f40aec1ff5cb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/111ad911cf888072558dfea6131f40aec1ff5cb6/0_0_7360_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Neill (Lord Carnarvon), Catherine Steadman (Maggie Lewis) and Max Irons (Howard Carter) in Tutankhamun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Neill (Lord Carnarvon), Catherine Steadman (Maggie Lewis) and Max Irons (Howard Carter) in Tutankhamun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Alblas/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the curse of the pharaohs still lingers because the dialogue was shocking: \u201cIf he\u2019s out there, he\u2019s waited 3,000 years; I believe he can wait a bit longer.\u201d Apart from Irons\u2019s fling with Catherine Steadman\u2019s American archaeologist (\u201cmarried to her work\u201d), the main excitement was provided by the unearthing of a mug that supposedly belonged to Tutankhamun but which rather resembled ancient Tupperware from the lost city of Argos. Ultimately, <em>Tutankhamun</em> was pleasant enough, a kind of underpowered sand-and-trowel affair, but it won\u2019t be enough to bury BBC rival <em>Poldark</em>.</p> <p>One of my all-time favourite films is Brian De Palma\u2019s <em>Carrie</em>, so I was intrigued by the opener to the three-part supernatural thriller <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/hub/him/2a4266a0001\"><strong>Him</strong></a>, written by Paula Milne (<em>The Politician\u2019s Husband</em>, <em>The Night Watch</em>). The eponymous, otherwise unnamed Him, ably portrayed by Fionn Whitehead, is a troubled, truanting, spliff-smoking 17-year-old whose telekinetic powers (from tying shoelaces with no hands to exploding water tanks) give him nosebleeds. His situation is exacerbated by the disappointing, warring adults surrounding him, most notably his divorced parents (tensely portrayed by Katherine Kelly and James Murray) and their hostile new partners (Lucy Liemann and Patrick Robinson).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8c9e6e004714dfa9710537ead0c4c240ff5550d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8c9e6e004714dfa9710537ead0c4c240ff5550d/0_211_5168_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fionn Whitehead as the teen with telekinetic powers in ITV\u2019s Him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fionn Whitehead as the teen with telekinetic powers in ITV\u2019s Him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Genower/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like any telekinetic drama worth its salt, <em>Him</em> centres on adolescent misery, isolation, fury and sundry other powerful emotions: Him was seen falling for his stepsister (Simona Brown), whose voiceover runs through the tale. There were times when it all got a bit too daft (sharp tools hovered <em>Tom and Jerry</em>-style above the stepfather\u2019s unwitting head), but I, for one, rather enjoyed the novelty of it all. The performances were universally strong, and there was a determined sense of artistry to Andy De Emmony\u2019s direction, birds flocking in the skies with Hitchcockian menace. The first episode climaxed with Him becoming aware of the dark potential of his powers and not seeming all that upset about it. If I were one of the parents, I\u2019d be considering confiscating any school prom tickets.</p>"
