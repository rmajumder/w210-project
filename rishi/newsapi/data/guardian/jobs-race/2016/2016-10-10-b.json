  "<p>Civil celebrants, priests and religious organisations, including businesses owned by churches, could refuse to perform or serve gay weddings under proposed changes released by the attorney general, George Brandis.</p> <p>Labor has blasted the draft changes to the Marriage Act and Sex Discrimination Act that would allow people to refuse only those marriages not between a man and a woman \u2013 in effect entrenching a second-tier status to same-sex weddings.</p> <p>The changes \u2013 which would need to be passed by parliament after a successful marriage equality plebiscite \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/warren-entsch-rejects-conservatives-call-for-right-to-refuse-gay-weddings\">less extensive than conservatives had hoped</a>. Several including Eric Abetz, George Christensen and Cory Bernardi have argued publicly that private businesses including florists and bakers should be able to discriminate against gay weddings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/10/coalition-hints-marriage-equality-plebiscite-funding-could-be-dumped-under-compromise\">Coalition hints marriage equality plebiscite funding could be dumped under compromise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abetz told Radio National the specific proposed changes had not passed cabinet, the party room or the backbench committee. </p> <p>Rather, cabinet only approved release of the exposure draft as a \u201cstarting point\u201d, he said, indicating Brandis has delayed but not avoided a fight over more extensive discrimination law changes.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2016/FourthQuarter/Exposure-Draft-Of-The-Marriage-Amendment-Same-Sex-Marriage-Bill.aspx\">Brandis released the exposure draft</a> on Monday evening before Labor\u2019s caucus meeting on Tuesday, which is expected to decide to block the plebiscite.</p> <p>Under the proposed changes ministers of religion and religious organisations would be able to refuse marriages not between a man and a woman \u201cwhere refusal conforms to the doctrines, tenets or beliefs\u201d of that religion.</p> <p>The exemption from discrimination law extends to religious organisations that \u201cprovide facilities, goods or services for the purpose of solemnisation of a same-sex marriage\u201d. On Sky News, Brandis confirmed this would include businesses owned by religious bodies being able to refuse gay weddings.</p> <p>Marriage celebrants, including those who are not ministers of religion, would be able to refuse to marry a same-sex couple \u201con the basis of conscientious or religious beliefs\u201d.</p> <p>The exposure draft proposes that the Marriage Act be changed to recognise marriage is a union between \u201ctwo people\u201d, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/13/marriage-equality-plebiscite-campaign-ads-run-by-third-parties-wont-need-to-be-true\">contrast with the proposed plebiscite question</a>, which would ask, \u201cShould the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to be married?\u201d</p> <p>Abetz noted the language of \u201ctwo people\u201d meant that transgender and intersex people would be able to marry.</p> <p>On Tuesday Brandis told ABC\u2019s AM the proposed changes \u201chit the sweet spot in the middle\u201d and reflected his own thinking before a further review by a parliamentary committee.</p> <p>When asked, the attorney general did not rule out the government reconsidering a free vote if the plebiscite was blocked.</p> <p>Brandis told Sky News the exemptions would not allow commercial service providers who were personally religious but not owned by a church to discriminate against gay weddings. That would be a \u201csignificant winding back of the existing protections of the Sex Discrimination Act\u201d, he said.</p> <p>In a statement shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, and equality spokeswoman Terri Butler said the amendments \u201cintroduce new forms of legal discrimination against the LGBTI community\u201d.</p> <p>The Labor pair noted \u201csame-sex couples can be barred from hiring a reception hall, for example, or using a particular caterer, if it is ultimately owned by a religious organisation, even if the good or service has nothing to do with religion at all\u201d.<br></p> <p>They said the government needs to explain why civil celebrants should be allowed to refuse same-sex couples. </p> <p>In September Guardian Australia was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/marriage-equality-law-would-protect-conscientious-objectors-who-reject-gay-weddings\">first to report that the government proposed to enshrine protections</a> for so-called conscientious objectors.</p> <p>The long-time marriage equality advocate Rodney Croome has told Guardian Australia only religious ministers should be able to refuse gay weddings.</p> <p>In comments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/29/warren-entsch-rejects-conservatives-call-for-right-to-refuse-gay-weddings\">before the proposed changes were released</a>, Croome said: \u201cSingling out same-sex couples will be direct discrimination, while allowing discrimination against other couples will cause an outcry, so either way the government can\u2019t win and should just drop the whole idea.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/09/labor-poised-to-kill-off-marriage-equality-plebiscite-when-parliament-resumes\">Labor poised to kill off marriage equality plebiscite when parliament resumes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, told ABC News Breakfast that an indication from the education minister, Simon Birmingham, on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/10/coalition-hints-marriage-equality-plebiscite-funding-could-be-dumped-under-compromise\">the government could drop public funding to win Labor support for the plebiscite</a> was \u201can absurd last-minute effort\u201d from the government.</p> <p>Plibersek criticised Brandis for releasing proposed Marriage Act and Sex Discrimination Act changes at 11pm on Monday before the caucus vote on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it is sincere ... it is not well handled at all,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Plibersek said she would not announce Labor\u2019s position before caucus met but \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to be a genius to work out where the majority of feeling is in the Labor caucus is on this\u201d.</p> <p>On Sky News Brandis said the test for Labor amounted to whether it \u201creally believed in marriage equality\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven if the plebiscite is not your preferred method, it\u2019s important not to let the means defeat the end,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The proposed plebiscite has been rejected by a wide range of marriage equality and LGBTI organisations, the Greens, the Nick Xenophon Team and senator Derryn Hinch.</p>",
  "<p>Jet Setting will be allowed to take her place in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Saturday despite having been supplemented into the wrong race on Monday. The mudloving filly provided her low-profile trainer, Adrian Keatley, with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/minding-irish-1000-guineas-defeat-jet-setting-aidan-obrien-oaks-curragh-horse-racing\" title=\"\">fairytale success in the Irish 1,000 Guineas</a> in May but her story almost had a nightmare twist when her name appeared among the field for Ascot\u2019s Fillies &amp; Mares race, run over half a mile further than Jet Setting has ever raced.</p> <p>Keatley was stunned to learn from the Guardian that his horse appeared to have been wrongly entered and indicated he would discuss the matter with his office staff. Rather against the run of form, however, the British Horseracing Authority proved flexible enough to allow Jet Setting to be switched into the QEII, even though the deadline for entries had passed.</p> <p>A BHA spokesman said: \u201cHaving been contacted about the error in a timely manner and after considering the individual circumstances, we felt that the appropriate course of action was to allow the horse to take its place in the intended race.\u201d</p> <p>Bookmakers appear unable to agree as to Jet Setting\u2019s chance, with <a href=\"http://www.oddschecker.com/horse-racing/ante-post-racing/flat/queen-elizabeth-ii-stakes/winner\" title=\"\">firms offering her at odds ranging from 8-1 to 14-1</a>. Minding, the filly she pipped in the Guineas, is widely expected to turn that form around on the likely faster surface. \u201cWe just need some rain,\u201d a relieved Keatley said after being assured that Jet Setting\u2019s entry had been corrected. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t persuade them to turn on the sprinklers, could you?\u201d</p> <p>The going on Ascot\u2019s straight course, to be used for the QEII, is good, good to soft in places, with only light showers expected on Wednesday and Friday. The inner course is firm in places and therefore seems unlikely to be used for the Champion Stakes, which would then be switched on to the outer track, where there is some give.</p> <p>The downside to that change would be a shorter run to the first bend, which may well cause traffic problems as there are 19 horses still entered after the five-day stage on Monday. They are headed by the 7-4 favourite Almanzor and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/02/found-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe-aidan-obrien-first-three-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe winner, Found</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe field is not only deep but very strong,\u201d said John Gosden, who plans to give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/27/jack-hobbs-irish-derby-william-buick-john-gosden-curragh\" title=\"\">Jack Hobbs his first outing</a> since April. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re under any illusions. I thought that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/10/almanzor-irish-champion-stakes-christophe-soumillon-frankie-dettori\" title=\"\">Almanzor\u2019s performance in the Irish Champion</a> was undoubtedly the best performance of any three-year-old this year, in fact any horse in Europe this year. I thought it was quite scintillating, his acceleration, so I see him clearly as the horse to beat.</p> <p>\u201cJack Hobbs has strengthened well, he\u2019s had the summer off and actually it\u2019s given him time to develop. Given his sire, they get better with age and I think that the time has benefited him enormously. He\u2019s in great order for it, a mile and a quarter is no problem for him and he\u2019s not a type that\u2019s ring-rusty. He won very well first time up as a three-year-old, but we\u2019re aware that we are coming back in a fantastic renewal of the race.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan O\u2019Brien is still mulling over his options for the various prizes on Qipco Champions Day and is not expected to make final decisions until Wednesday evening at the earliest. Found is thought robust enough to represent him in the Champion Stakes, just 13 days after her Arc success, which would leave Minding to contest the QEII.</p> <p>The Irishman has seven other horses entered across those two races, plus seven in other races on the Ascot card. Those are headed by Order Of St&#xa0;George, who will be a hot favourite if lining up for the Long Distance Cup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/16/order-of-st-george-gold-cup-royal-ascot-ryan-moore-aidan-o-brien\" title=\"\">at the scene of his Gold Cup success in June</a>.</p> <p>Henry Candy said Limato was likely to take his chance in the Champions Sprint if the ground remained mostly good, despite having won the Prix de la For\u00eat on Arc day less than a fortnight before. \u201cHe does seem to take his races much better,\u201d Candy said. \u201cEarlier in the year, if you\u2019d told me that he could run twice in a fortnight I\u2019d have thought you were mad, but it does seem to be a possibility now.\u201d</p> <p>Limato heads the Sprint betting on 11-4 with Twilight Son, also likely to represent Candy, at 10-1.</p> <p>Belardo will miss the QEII after suffering a setback, Roger Varian said. The Godolphin horse will now retire to stud in Ireland having won two Group Ones, the Dewhurst of 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/belardo-royal-ascot-roger-varian-newbury-lockinge-stakes-godolphin-log-out-island-horse-racing\" title=\"\">this year\u2019s Lockinge</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Black communities in London are disproportionately more likely to breathe illegal levels of air pollution than white and Asian ones, new research seen exclusively by the Guardian shows.</p> <p>The study for the mayor of London shows black, African and Caribbean people account for 15.3% of all Londoners exposed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels that breach EU limits, but they account for just 13.3% of the city\u2019s population.</p> <p>The proportion of white and Asian individuals exposed to the dangerous NO2 levels is lower than the fraction of the population they account for, said Aether, the consultancy which produced the report.<br></p> <p>Southwark, Lambeth and Hackney were among the boroughs with an overlap of both a higher proportion of black residents and the higher pollution levels.</p> <p>Previous research has shown there is a clear link between economically deprived areas and greater exposure to polluted air.

In areas with poor air quality, 32% of people living there were from the most deprived groups, versus 7% from the least deprived.</p> <p>\u201cThis research shows the disproportionate impact air pollution has on deprived communities in London,\u201d said Aether\u2019s director, Katie King.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have known for some time now that poor families end up living in cheaper housing which is often in close proximity to busy roads,\u201d said a spokesman for the air quality unit at King\u2019s College London.</p> <p>However, he said the new study\u2019s use of proportionate data was misleading, as in absolute terms there are more Asian and white people exposed to high NO2 levels.<br></p> <p>Last month, the Black Lives Matter UK group linked ethnicity and environmental issues <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/black-lives-matter-protesters-occupy-london-city-airport-runway\">during a protest at London City airport</a> - although the protestors were also criticised for their largely white membership.</p> <p>The study compiled King\u2019s data on NO2 concentrations in 2013 \u2013 the most recent available \u2013 census results, official statistics on deprivation and ethnic profiles of small areas in London. In total, 1.9 million people in London were exposed to NO2 concentrations above the EU\u2019s annual average limit.<br></p> <p>The work is an update of a report which the former mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/16/boris-johnson-accused-of-burying-study-linking-pollution-and-deprived-schools\">Boris Johnson was accused of burying when Khan took office</a>. That earlier report showed 433 primary schools were exposed to NO2 above the limits in 2010, with that number falling to 360 by 2013 in today\u2019s study, showing some areas have got cleaner.</p> <p>Transport for London (TfL) published a consultation on Monday seeking Londoners\u2019 views on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/13/sadiq-khan-to-double-size-londons-clean-air-zone-pollution\">Khan\u2019s new measures to tackle the problem</a>. They include whether to introduce a \u00a310 emissions surcharge in October 2017, the so-called T-charge, which will mostly apply to pre-2005 diesel cars.</p> <p>Khan and TfL are also consulting on whether to bring in an enlarged \u201cultra low emissions zone\u201d (Ulez) in 2019 rather than 2020 as previously planned, charging owners of dirtier cars \u00a312.50 to enter. Both charges will be in addition to the existing \u00a311.50 congestion charge.</p> <p>\u201cToxic air in London is a health emergency that requires bold action, including introducing charges for older polluting vehicles and expanding the Ulez,\u201d said Khan.</p> <p>Environmental groups and thinktanks welcomed the proposals, but Friends of the Earth said the mayor needed to go further.</p> <p>\u201cTo bring down London\u2019s air pollution as quickly as possible, Sadiq Khan must extend the Ulez for all vehicles across the whole of London; and create a plan for phasing out diesel on London\u2019s roads altogether,\u201d said Sophie Neuburg, a campaigner at the green group.</p> <p>Next week the government faces a court case brought by environmental law firm ClientEarth over what it says is an inadequate plan to reduce NO2 pollution.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement sends a clear message to the government that it needs to get a grip with this public health crisis. This is a national problem that needs a national solution. That is why we are taking them back to court next week,\u201d said Alan Andrews, a ClientEarth lawyer.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>\u2018I was hundreds of miles from my family with no income\u2019</strong><br></h2> <p>The majority of my experiences have been positive. However, one stands out. When I started, I didn\u2019t tell this employer about my conditions. As usual, my anxiety began to make me sick. I took more and more sick days as I tried to struggle through, and it was eventually noticed. I ended up telling them about my mental health conditions. They nodded along politely, but basically gave me an ultimatum. They would not do anything to help, I would have to effectively \u201cman up\u201d or be fired. I tried, but the anxiety and depression were far too strong. I ended up back in the meeting room with my manager, and was told that I had not passed the probation period. I was left living in London, hundreds of miles from my nearest family, with no income.</p> <p><em>Ryan Ashton, 30, software developer </em><br></p> <h2><strong>\u2018Telling my manager went better than I thought it would\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I suffer from depression and anxiety, so it took me a while to get out there and start my career. When I did it was extremely hard. Many sick days were taken to avoid having to face people and the fear of needing to perform well. A little after a year into my job I decided to take the dreaded leap. I told my manager about my mental health, and it went better than I thought it would! Luckily where I work hours are flexible and working from home is permitted. I now work from home every Friday, which has made a massive difference.</p> <p><em>Amy Shelley, 20, business and administration apprentice </em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/04/mental-health-uk-business-employees-management-wellbeing-marks-spencer-mind\">The culture of silence around mental health in the workplace must end</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>\u2018I had to leave the profession I loved\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I write having had to leave the profession I loved because I became mentally ill. I had been a head teacher for more than 12 years but began to suffer serious anxiety and panic after a negative inspection report. I felt bullied by both the governing body and the local authority, and when I finally cracked and had to take time off I had no support from them. When I tried to return they refused to make any allowances. Eventually I found that I couldn\u2019t work because I was too ill. Despite a successful career, popularity with parents and children, and demonstrably improving school results over many years, they never once tried to work with me to help me return to being the effective leader I once was. </p> <p><em>Anonymous, head teacher <br></em></p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s hard to explain what it can be like to deal with on a daily basis\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I joined the Civil Service in 2013 and have had three or four major depressive episodes since then. Each line manager I have had, barring one, has been incredibly supportive. One in particular stands out as being exemplary in assisting me back to work, having gone through similar events themselves. It is difficult to explain to someone who has never experienced poor mental health what it can be like to deal with on a daily basis. Everyone has bad days, but to explain how it can feel almost impossible to get out of bed to someone who just doesn\u2019t get it can leave you exposed and invalidated. </p> <p><em>Anonymous, civil servant </em></p> <h2><strong>\u2018As a teacher, the targets and relentless pressure take their toll\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I had a complete breakdown this time last year. I was suicidal, very low and my confidence was sapped away. I am now back at work and living life again. Things are different and my school has a good understanding of mental health and is trying to address the issues. Unfortunately the profession that I am in means that the targets and relentless pressure take their toll. We have had an external company help the school which is really encouraging.</p> <p><em>Anonymous, teacher </em></p> <h2><strong>\u2018The stigma remains\u2019</strong></h2> <p>I am currently suffering the after effects of a bereavement which brought about major issues, some of which I have shared with my line manager. Each instance is met with the briefest acknowledgement (at best) before it\u2019s on with the agenda. Every day I struggle to keep going. I\u2019m paying for my own counselling, none being available elsewhere, despite attending three separate NHS referrals. An issue in itself but this pales into insignificance when compared with the \u201clip service\u201d paid to the issue within my own organisation. The stigma remains.

I feel my mental health is fine at the moment but I worry for my future and that of my colleagues. Workers in the NHS and elsewhere are being presented with support in the form of mindfulness courses and resources and talk of resilience. This is all well and good, but if the work is changing in a way that is negatively impacting on staff\u2019s mental health, this is no better than paying lip service to the mental health of a workforce.</p> <p><em>Anonymous, GP </em></p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>Living wages, permanent contracts and flexible working are vital<strong>\u2019</strong><br></h2> <p>I have a ten year employment history with health and wellbeing charities.

It is one thing being aware of the signs and symptoms of stress and anxiety, but entirely useless if an employer is not in a position to offer living wages, permanent contracts or flexible working hours. This is a particular problem within the charity sector, where a move towards short-term, results-led project funding has seen HR departments vanish, training resources depleted, part-time, short-term contracts and pressure for project staff to get measurable results in absurdly short time frames.</p> <p><em>Sam Whyte, 30, social media manager </em></p>",

Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition.

Her Attacks on Hillary Clinton Are Not.</strong></a></p> <p>To be clear, I\u2019ve always found Broaddrick\u2019s claims about Bill Clinton credible, though only the two of them know the truth. Five people say she told them about the assault right after it allegedly happened. She denied the rape in a 1997 affidavit filed with Paula Jones\u2019 lawyers but changed her story the next year, when she was interviewed by the FBI in the course of Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation. At the time, some Clinton defenders treated her changing story as evidence of her untrustworthiness, but it seems perfectly plausible that, as she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/24/us/on-tortuous-route-sexual-assault-accusation-against-clinton-resurfaces.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <em>New York Times</em>, she hadn\u2019t wanted to go public but also felt she couldn\u2019t lie to federal investigators. In the 1990s, Clinton defenders sometimes pointed to the fact that Broaddrick attended a Clinton fundraiser three weeks after she says he raped her. But we know it\u2019s not uncommon for rape victims to blame themselves and continue to seek their rapists\u2019 favor. After all, I also believe <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-groper-in-chief.html\">Jill Harth</a>, who accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment and attempted rape, even though later, reeling from a divorce, she became his girlfriend.</p> <p>Far less credible, however, is Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Hillary Clinton tried to intimidate her into silence. </p> <p><strong>Click through above to read the full piece.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/09/trumps-lawsuits-include-20-involving-allegations-mistreating-women-president-republican/91832012/\"><strong>Trump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits</strong></a></p> <p>One woman sued Donald Trump\u2019s Miami resort saying she lost her job because she got pregnant.</p> <p>Two others claimed they were fired after complaining that co-workers sexually harassed them.</p> <p>And a number of women testified in a lawsuit that Trump himself repeatedly instructed managers to hire younger, prettier workers at his Los Angeles golf club.</p> <p>The release of a video Friday showing Trump\u2019s sexist remarks in 2005 has created a firestorm of controversy that threatens to derail his campaign.

  "<h2>Donald Trump\u2019s claims</h2> <h2><strong><br>\u2018The US is giving back $150bn to a terrorist state\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The US is not giving any of its own money to Iran as part of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-expected-to-be-announced-in-vienna\">international nuclear arms deal</a> meant to prevent the construction of weapons. The deal <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/iaea-director-general%E2%80%99s-statement-iran\">gradually unfreezes assets</a> that belong to Iran but were frozen under sanctions related to the nation\u2019s nuclear programme. Sanctions related to human rights, terrorism and other issues remain in place and still lock Iran out of billions.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s guess of how much Iran will benefit by unfrozen assets is far higher than most experts\u2019 estimates, though not inconceivable. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>; Iranian officials have said between <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>. Independent economists have calculated that Iran will free up anything <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-iran-frozen-assets-20160120-story.html\">between $30bn to $100bn</a>. Complicating the calculations are Iran\u2019s debts: it will have to pay off tens of billions to countries <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/world/getting-china-sanction-iran/p24212\">such as China</a>.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Just today, policemen were shot, two killed, and this is happening on a weekly basis\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Two police officers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/08/three-police-officers-shot-palm-springs-california\">shot dead on Saturday in Palm Springs.</a></p> <p>Trump\u2019s claim is only one slice of a much larger story that does not support his argument. His campaign cited <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html\">data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund</a> (NLEOMF), which does show <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">a 56% increase</a> in officers killed by guns between 1 January and 16 July 2016 (28) compared with the same span in 2015 (18). But according to the non-profit group, officer deaths overall, including from traffic accidents and job-related illnesses, are roughly on par with figures from this point in 2015: 60 deaths this year to 61 the year before.</p> <p>The non-profit\u2019s data also shows that police fatalities overall <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/\">have declined</a> in the last 15 years: in the last seven years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency theaverage number of police deaths was 135, , a 17% decline on the final seven years of George W Bush\u2019s administration, when there were an average of 162 a year. Gun deaths have declined, though only slightly, between the administrations. Police fatalities have in general declined in the last 40 years: from 1991 to 2000, an average of 162 officers were killed each year; from 1981 to 1990, an average of 186; from 1971 to 1980, an average of 230.</p> <p>The deadliest era for police in the US was prohibition. In the years between its enactment and repeal, from 1920 to 1933, an average of 250 officers were killed each year. Gun-related deaths were <a href=\"http://www.nleomf.org/facts/research-bulletins/?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/causes.html?referrer=http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">highest in 1973</a>, according to the NLEOMF figures, when 156 officers were killed.</p> <p>The FBI also <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2014-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted\">reports</a> police deaths with information submitted to it from various law enforcement agencies, though its most recent figures date from 2014. According to such data, that year 96 law enforcement officers were killed, 51 by \u201cfelonious acts\u201d and 45 in accidents, and 48,315 officers were assaulted while on duty. Forty-six of the officers were killed by guns; 28 died in car accidents. Almost 80% of assaults were by people using their hands and feet. The last four years of Bush\u2019s presidency and the first four of Obama\u2019s recorded <a href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2014/tables/table_29_leos_fk_type_of_weapon_2005-2014.xls\">about the same number of gun-related police deaths</a>, according to this data, with about 46 a year.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I did not say that \u2026 it\u2019s locker room talk\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump did say that he would \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d, and was recorded saying so in 2005 in a video published by the Washington Post on Friday.</p> <p>Pressed by moderator Anderson Cooper, he did admit to having made the comment, though he then said he had never actually acted in the way.

Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in the investigation is not clear, but in June 1992 she said on the Arsenio Hall Show that Flowers had \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia0CS8uvegg\">got lots of problems</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Trump joked about sexual assault in the 2005 video released by the Washington Post on Friday, saying that he believed fame gave him the right to \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Bill Clinton \u2018had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones who is here tonight\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Paula Jones was an Arkansas state employee who alleged that Bill Clinton, while he was governor in 1991, exposed himself in a sexual advance on her. In 1994 she sued him for sexual harassment, but a federal judge dismissed the case on the grounds that even if her allegations were true (at least <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wzQgOuIm8RgC&amp;pg=RA1-PT319&amp;lpg=RA1-PT319&amp;dq=clinton+doctors+distinguishing+characteristic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YF9lnMjvwm&amp;sig=k1xwK9IQLAXUaB57t0OnLk3w314&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL2d-86JHKAhWMOCYKHQiJC4wQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=clinton%20doctors%20distinguishing%20characteristic&amp;f=false\">one of her claims was found false</a>) the behaviour did not constitute sexual harassment under the law\u2019s definition of it.

A former aide named Mark Penn wrote a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/4097983/Penn-Strategy-Memo-3-19-07#fullscreen&amp;from_embed\">2007 memo</a> that Obama\u2019s \u201clack of American roots\u201d could \u201chold him back\u201d.

In the months before the Iraq war began in 2003, Trump tepidly endorsed invasion to <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/buzzfeedandrew/trump-on-the-howard-stern-show-on-sept-11-2002?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">radio host Howard Stern</a>, who asked him whether he thought the US should attack Saddam Hussein. \u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>A few weeks later he told Fox News that George W Bush was \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d. Several weeks after the invasion, Trump told the Washington Post: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/archive/lifestyle/2003/03/25/hollywood-partyers-soldiering-on/06327347-83d3-44c4-ab7b-dcd6fbda5437/?resType=accessibility\">The war\u2019s a mess</a>.\u201d In August 2004, he told <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/interviews/a37230/donald-trump-esquire-cover-story-august-2004/\">Esquire</a>: \u201cTwo minutes after we leave, there\u2019s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\u201d</p> <p>Even in <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/a-guide-to-donald-trump-early-flip-flops-on-the-iraq-war?utm_term=.vq5VjeKwe#.uy2eDvV5v\">the interview</a> cited by the Trump campaign to explain his \u201copposition\u201d, Trump expressed impatience with Bush for not invading sooner. \u201cWhatever happened to the days of the Douglas MacArthur? He would go and attack. He wouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Hillary Clinton wants to increase refugees by 550%</strong></h2> <p>Trump is correct that Clinton has proposed a 550% increase in refugees, from 10,000 in 2016 to 65,000 in 2017.</p> <p>But this does not add up to \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d, as he says. He appears to have borrowed this figure from an ally, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who <a href=\"http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/6/clinton-refugee-plan-could-bring-in-620-000-refugees-in-first-term-at-lifetime-cost-of-over-400-billion\">invented it.</a> Session falsely claims Clinton would continue to grant asylum to 55,000 Syrian refugees every year in addition to 100,000 refugees from the Middle East in general. Clinton has called for allowing 55,000 refugees from Syria for one year, and has not proposed yearly asylum for 155,000 Middle East refugees for her term.</p> <h2>\u2018<strong>People are coming into our country, like, we have no idea who they are, where they\u2019re from, what their feelings about our country are \u2026 We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love of our country\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This is false. The US has probably the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with state department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then homeland security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee; and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years.

In 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKkKQmbyECw\">told a National Press Club luncheon</a>: \u201cI was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success.\u201d A year earlier, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-putin-tried-arrange-meeting-moscow-source-n619006\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI do have a relationship and I can tell you that he\u2019s very interested in what we\u2019re doing here today.\u201d</p> <p>Last November, Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/4107636/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-debate-in-milwaukee/\">claimed in a debate</a> that he \u201cgot to know [Putin] very well because we were both on 60 Minutes\u201d. They appeared in separate, pre-taped segments of the current affairs show and were not on set together.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly tried to do business in Russia, and his refusal to release tax returns prevents him proving that he has no assets there. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEbMg-JoQ1Q\">July</a> press conference, Trump admitted, \u201cI guess probably I sell condos to Russians,\u201d and gave a slightly exaggerated account of a $95m condominium sale.

It would increase tax revenue by $1.1tn over a decade, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals\">the Tax Policy Center estimated</a>, though much of that money would go into spending plans. The Committee for a Responsible Budget <a href=\"http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-update\">estimated</a> that Clinton\u2019s plan would add about $200bn to the debt, saying it would raise tax revenue by $191bn but decrease GDP by 1% \u201cover the long term due to slightly higher marginal tax rates on capital and labor\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tax plan would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding $5.3tn to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. Another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018[The US is] just about the highest taxed country in the word\u2019</strong></h2> <p>For months, Trump falsely claimed that the US is one of the highest-taxed countries in the world; he later adjusted to a more specific and more correct claim, about corporate tax rates. The US corporate income tax rate does rank among the highest among industrialised nations, <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLE_II1\">according to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)</a>.

In 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/22/483100251/fact-check-trumps-speech-on-clinton-annotated\">Congressional Research Service wrote</a>: \u201cNafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe net overall effect of Nafta on the US economy appears to have been relatively modest.\u201d <br></p> <p> A <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/effects-of-nafta-on-us-employment-and-policy-responses_5k9ffbqlvk0r-en;jsessionid=51i123ekendpf.x-oecd-live-03\">2012 report by the OECD </a>found that manufacturing jobs did flee the US after the deal was signed, but also noted the broader shift toward a service economy. North American trade is dwarfed by that with Asia: China has <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/indonesia-climbs-in-ranking-of-worlds-largest-manufacturers-1461244252\">become the world\u2019s largest manufacturer</a>, and the beneficiary of trade agreements, such as the \u201c<a href=\"http://tech.mit.edu/V114/N27/china.27w.html\">most favored nation</a>\u201d status that Bill Clinton renewed for the country. George W Bush then<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/18/world/china-trade-wrangle-bush-speech-bush-invoking-3-presidents-casts-vote-for-china.html\"> supported China\u2019s entry </a>into the World Trade Organisation, where the US and China have since become <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/business/international/china-defends-trade-policies-after-us-files-case-at-wto.html\">court adversaries</a>.</p> <h2>Clinton\u2019s claims</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32623fd29f1c0c8830b52e432cc5a2af70ddac73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32623fd29f1c0c8830b52e432cc5a2af70ddac73/0_83_3924_2355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton makes a point\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton makes a point.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul J.

He also apologised vaguely for things he \u201cregretted\u201d earlier this year, but did not specify to whom he meant the apology.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018After a year-long investigation there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using, and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all, anyone who says otherwise has no basis \u2026 has no evidence that classified material ended up in the wrong hands\u2019</strong></h2> <p>This is a highly legalistic answer. FBI director James Comey, who led the investigation and found that Clinton\u2019s practices were \u201cextremely careless\u201d, said <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/us/hillary-clintons-email-was-probably-hacked-experts-say.html\">it was very likely that Clinton\u2019s server was hacked</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Clinton: premiums haven\u2019t gotten too high<br></strong><strong>Trump: premium\u2019s are up \u201868%, 59%, 71%\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Both candidates are correct that healthcare premiums have increased since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On average, premiums have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">risen</a> by about 5.8% a year since Barack Obama took office, compared with 13.2% in the nine years before Obama, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">Politifact found</a> earlier this year.

Another slave-owning founder was Thomas Jefferson, whose Qur\u2019an has entered <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/29/thomas-jefferson-s-quran-how-islam-shaped-the-founders.html\">congressional lore</a>.

Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and Republican, led the effort in Congress and passed the CHIP healthcare program in a budget bill after the first lady\u2019s efforts to lead a broader healthcare reform bill failed. Clinton tried to claim credit for the program during her failed 2008 campaign for president, and at the time Kennedy <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100501343_pf.html\">gave great credit</a> to her for efforts. Hatch <a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/03/14/clinton_role_in_health_program_disputed/\">disputed that account</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The New Start treaty helped reduce Russia\u2019s nuclear arms</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s correct that the New Start treaty set limits on deployed American and Russian ballistic missiles, bombers, launchers and warheads. But the story is much larger than these terms.</p> <p>Russia was already within limits in two categories before the treaty was signed, in 2011; the treaty does not affect undeployed or retired weapons; and Russia has reduced its nuclear arms more slowly in the last decade than it did while George W Bush and Bill Clinton were in the White House. Nor does the treaty prevent countries from stockpiling weapons. In the last two years, Russia has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-33151125\">increased its arsenal</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Clinton: \u2018bullying is up\u2019 because of Trump\u2019s rhetoric</strong></h2> <p>The left-leaning Southern Poverty Law Center has described a \u201cTrump effect\u201d based on a survey of 2,0000 teachers, and the National Education Association, which supports Clinton, has made similar claims. But there\u2019s no peer-reviewed data to support this claim at this point.</p> <h2>Clinton: all gains in economic recovery since 2008 have gone to the wealthiest</h2> <p>This was true until last month, but Clinton is now using an out of date talking point: in September, the Census reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/household-income-increase-poverty-us-census-report\">that median household income increased greatly</a> for the first time since the recession and financial crisis.</p> <p></p>",
  "<h2>Champions Day entries</h2> <p>From 1pm, the entries for Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday will be revealed. Gina Harding will be live with a Newmarket press conference to reveal the big names being aimed at the day and to discuss their chances with trainers including John Gosden and Henry Candy, and you can watch a live stream of it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px5Or4ebvxg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">here</a>.<br></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px5Or4ebvxg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/px5Or4ebvxg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Today\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook </h2> <p>As a general rule, I think you\u2019re best sticking to horses that have already shown enough ability to win the race for which you\u2019re backing them. But from time to time I\u2019m prepared to take a chance on a beast that needs to show significant improvement and <strong>Ma Peek (5.00)</strong> at Windsor today is one of those, the surrounding circumstances suggesting to me that he may very well outrun market expectations.</p> <p>Ma Peek is a three-year-old with Brian Meehan and had three maiden runs for him from April to June. At that time, Meehan\u2019s strike-rate was 6%. Since the start of August, Meehan\u2019s string seem to have got over whatever was ailing them and have been scoring at 16%. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/09/horse-racing-tips-monday-10-october\">Horse racing tips: Monday 10 October</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bred to need a bit of time and distance, Ma Peek should now be closer to the finished article after a three-month break, as well as hopefully being fitter and healthier than when last seen. He starts in handicaps off a rating so low that it will surely prove lenient in time. </p> <p>After all, Ma Peek is bred to be good, being a three-parts brother to Arch Rebel, four times a Listed winner in Ireland about a decade ago. He wears a first-time tongue tie today. </p> <p>All in all, the 10-1 looks big to me. But then I have to remind myself that this is a horse who has shown basically no racecourse ability to date. </p> <p>The case for <strong>Upavon (4.00) </strong>takes less assembling, he having won four of his last six and generally been excellent since joining Stuart Williams at the end of last year and being fitted with a tongue tie. There were clear excuses for the two defeats (one blown start, one failure to stay seven furlongs). <br></p> <p>His rating continues to climb but he has won off a 10lb higher mark on the all-weather and I think there\u2019s still room for him to do better on turf. The 7-1 is fine. <br></p> <p>Finally, on a point of interest rather than a tip, Icespire makes her debut in the 2.50pm race at Salisbury and is currently 5-4. From the John Gosden yard, she is a Frankel half-sister to Special Duty, who has a place in my heart, since I somehow collected on her in two Classics, despite the fact that she wasn\u2019t first past the post either time. </p> <p>God bless the stewards. Anyway, the relevant point is that Special Duty was not just lucky but also very fast and it will be interesting to see if Icespire can compare. She wears a hood, which might end up being a regular thing for Frankel\u2019s progeny. </p> <p><em>We are no longer able to continue with competitions every week, but they will still run in the biggest weeks (Cheltenham, Aintree, Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and maybe one or two others, as well as the Christmas quiz). <br></em></p> <p><em>We\u2019ll still have a Talking Horses each day for tips, analysis and news, so we very much hope you\u2019ll join us to chew over whatever racing happens to be going on and post your tips or racing-related comments below. </em><br></p>"
