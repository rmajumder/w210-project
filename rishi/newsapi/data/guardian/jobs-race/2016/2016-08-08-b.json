  "<p>Cycling\u2019s world governing body, the UCI, has moved to defend the Olympic cycling course <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/lizzie-armitstrad-anna-van-der-breggen-road-race-olympics-crash-annemiek-van-vleuten\" title=\"\">after a series of crashes</a> in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s road races in Rio de Janeiro. The most serious incident left the Dutch cyclist Annemiek van Vleuten in hospital with three cracks in her spine and concussion while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/richie-portes-olympics-ended-after-crash-leaves-him-with-broken-scapula\" title=\"\">the Australian cyclist Richie Porte suffered a broken scapula</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/08/rio-olympics-2016-day-three-adam-peaty-gold-michael-phelps-tom-daley-live\">Rio Olympics 2016: day three begins with rowing, fencing and more \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Rio 2016 road race course was carefully designed and was extensively tested at the test event and in training,\u201d said the UCI. \u201cWe do our utmost to design safe, challenging courses but unfortunately crashes do sometimes occur due to a combination of factors.\u201d</p> <p>Van Vleuten has tweeted from her hospital bed to say that she is OK but disappointed that the best ride of her career ended with a horror crash in the final stages of the race.

A video posted by a member of the public on Facebook showed her lying motionless as riders passed her down the hill with no immediate sign of medical help.</p> <p>Early on Monday morning local time <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AvVleuten/status/762465519844732930\" title=\"\">Van Vleuten tweeted to say</a>: \u201cI am now in the hospital with some injuries and fractures, but will be fine.

As well as racing she owns Annemiek van Vleuten ProVelo, which organises cycling clinics and presentations.</p> <p>After Van Vleuten\u2019s crash, her team-mates waited nervously for news from the hospital. Gracie Elvin, an Australian who rides with her for Orica, said: \u201cShe\u2019s one of the most positive people on our team, she\u2019s been my biggest fan this year and given me lots of confidence.

  "<p><strong>Now that we are in August, has there been a big trend for summer 2016?<br></strong><em>Mia, N1</em></p> <p>Indeed there is, Mia, and it\u2019s one that I only cottoned on to after the US political conventions \u2013 not, it has to be said, usually a hotbed of fashion trends. I don\u2019t want to be mean about American politicians (well, not all of them), but let\u2019s put it this way: they don\u2019t tend to give Milan fashion week too many paroxysms of insecurity when it comes to carving out the look of the season.</p> <p>And yet, a trend most definitely came from, of all places, Pittsburgh and Cleveland \u2013 and that trend is white. I first noticed this during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama\">Melania Trump\u2019s karaoke version of Michelle Obama\u2019s speech</a> during the Republican National Convention, when she wore a white Roksanda dress that was a lot more impressive than anything that came out of her mouth. It was also, I thought, not very Melania. I have made it my mission over the past decade to acquaint myself with the ways of Melania, just as I did with Donald Trump\u2019s previous two wives, all of them fascinating in their own ways. Each of his wives was perfect for the decade in which they married him: Ivana, with her shoulder pads and open love of wealth, was like a human embodiment of the 80s; Marla Maples looked like a cast member of Baywatch or Melrose Place, making her perfect for the 90s. Then there\u2019s Melania, with her frankly terrifying smoky-eye makeup and permanently blown-out hair: so very 21st century. She looks, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll take this as an insult, like an assassin in a Bourne movie, or maybe an Austin Powers film, or possibly even Zoolander. Anyway, the soft femininity of the Roksanda dress was so strikingly different from Melania\u2019s usual fembot style (which can be summed up as tight and pointy with brass detailings) that I knew something was up. As, indeed, it was: white was up.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/emotion-watching-hillary-clinton-woman-candidate-for-president\">Hillary Clinton then wore a white pantsuit at the DNC</a>, a nod, apparently, to white being the colour of the suffragettes. Rather amusingly, Congresswoman <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/the-daily-briefing/2016/07/290716-why-everyone-is-talking-about-joyce-beatty-dress.html\">Joyce Beatty wore the same white dress as Melania to the DNC</a>, and not only did she look better in it, she also reminded everyone about what is now referred to as the Melania Incident. So 2-0 to Congresswoman Beatty.</p> <p>Finally, this week, Michelle Obama wore a sleeveless <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/08/02/michelle-obama-singapore-state-dinner-brandon-maxwell/87979666/\">full-length white dress to a state dinner for the prime minister of Singapore</a>. I like to think Queen Obama chose this as an homage to the <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1872988,00.html\">full-length white dress by Jason Wu</a> that she wore to the Inaugural Ball in a kinda \u201cRemember that night? Well, now we are outta here! You\u2019re gonna miss us, guys!\u201d way.</p> <p>White really is the ultimate power colour. We can talk about its references to purity, saintliness and all other words that are just synonyms for virginity until the white cows come home. But the truth is, what it is about now is a woman who wants to be noticed, doesn\u2019t care if her thighs look fat and doesn\u2019t give a damn about her dry-cleaning bill. Now, if that isn\u2019t a power statement, I don\u2019t know what is. And that\u2019s what summer 2016 is all about, fashion-wise: ladies not giving a good goddamn, whether it\u2019s about breaking glass ceilings or blatantly ripping off someone else\u2019s speech on the international stage.</p> <p>Ah well, win some, lose some, eh, ladies?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad0350165c9f4371489344c504545d910ac033b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad0350165c9f4371489344c504545d910ac033b2/0_0_3808_4760/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jessica Parker ... not a feminist.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Jessica Parker ... not a feminist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lovekin/WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker has disowned feminism. What does this mean?<br></strong><em>Cara, by email</em></p> <p>That she\u2019s an idiot? I mean, I know this column is called Ask Hadley, but it\u2019s hard to know how to answer this question, at least without being blatantly rude. To recap, <a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a21886/sarah-jessica-parker-september-2016-cover/\">Parker was interviewed in Marie Claire</a> and was asked if she considers herself a feminist. \u201cI am not a feminist,\u201d she replied, to the sound of a million heads falling on the desk. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of separation. I just want people to be treated equally.\u201d</p> <p>You know, when Andrea Leadsom said something similar last month, I honestly didn\u2019t mind. \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist because I\u2019m not anti-men ... <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/andrea-leadson-feminist-feminism-times_uk_5780f9eee4b074297db31b28\">Feminism is a term that has been used to abuse men, so I don\u2019t identify with it</a>,\u201d quoth Andrea, in the now infamous interview that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/11/conservative-leadership-andrea-leadsom-pulls-out-of-race\">ended up torpedoing her leadership bid</a>. And the reason I didn\u2019t mind is because I didn\u2019t expect her to know better: she\u2019s a Tory MP who looks like she hangs out at private golf clubs in Surrey. I never thought she would be up on her Dworkin. But SJP, for God\u2019s sake. You live in Manhattan, you starred in a show that was in some ways a feminist landmark, you have \u2013 I assume \u2013 New York friends. How could you have got to the age of 51 and still be saying things like this without hitting yourself in the face? There\u2019s nothing surprising about a celebrity saying something stupid \u2013 the truth is that most celebrities are stupid. But for a woman who grew up in the 70s, lives in a modern metropolitan city and hangs out with writers and artists to not understand that feminism is about equality, well, that takes some serious effort. Well done, SJP. You win the coveted crown of Ask Hadley\u2019s Numpty of the Month.</p>",

  "<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-job-vacancies-fall-700000-in-the-week-after-brexit-data-shows-a7124686.html\">data by CEB</a>, job adverts fell by 700,000 in the week after the British people voted to leave the European Union. So if you were thinking of changing jobs, you may be thinking you should put your CV on ice. No one likes uncertainty and until there is more clarity about our future relationship with the EU and the impact of a Brexit on the jobs market, the outlook is uncertain. </p> <p>However, we need to focus on the positives. It may not be as bad as we fear \u2013 the UK is still the sixth <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/24/france-overtakes-uk-as-fifth-largest-economy-as-pound-plummets-5964746/\">largest economy</a> in the world; plus, findings from a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/agentssummary/2016/jul.aspx\">Bank of England survey</a> of its nationwide agents revealed that two thirds of firms are pressing on with hiring plans as normal.</p> <p>Now is actually the time to start thinking how you can turn the current situation to your advantage and get ahead of the game.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t think everyone has stopped recruiting</strong></h2> <p>The news would certainly have us believe that employers are not hiring, but actually it is likely that firms who put recruitment on hold pre-Brexit now need to fill the vacancies they froze until the EU referendum result was announced. </p> <p>Do your research and check whether the industry you are interested in is advertising. And be proactive by sending out tailored applications to the companies you want to work for \u2013 they might just arrive in a recruiting manager\u2019s inbox at the right time. Remember that August is always a bit quieter on the job front but the autumn will see an increase in recruitment, so be ready.</p> <h2><strong>Odds of getting a job may improve as others give up</strong></h2> <p>Competition for jobs may be reduced post-referendum, as many job hunters assume it\u2019s not a good time to apply for jobs, and there may be fewer EU nationals applying for roles in the UK. </p> <h2><strong>Prepare and get ready to be proactive</strong></h2> <p>If you feel more cautious or your industry is more affected by the referendum result, as is financial services for example, then you may decide to put your job search on hold. If you do, then use the time you have to prepare.</p> <h2></h2> <p>Investing time in crafting a really strong CV and updating your LinkedIn profile will reap benefits. Again, do your research and think about what you can bring to a company \u2013 what changes might a potential Brexit cause in your industry, and how can you contribute? You can drill down even further and consider what leaving the EU will mean to your profession and what new skills or knowledge you could focus on developing to be able to deal with future challenges.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/may/23/work-after-brexit-the-biggest-winners-and-losers-for-uk-jobs\">Work after Brexit: the biggest winners and losers for UK jobs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Make sure you highlight these areas in your applications \u2013 it demonstrates you are thinking strategically and are commercially aware.</p> <h2><strong>Attend networking events and schedule lunches</strong></h2> <p> Employers will continue to recruit using non-traditional routes, so building a sound network and letting your contacts know that you\u2019re looking for a job can be an effective way to hear about potential vacancies. It is also a good way to find out what employers will be looking for post-Brexit. Be clear about your message and how you can add value.</p> <h2><strong>Re-evaluate and reach out to recruiters</strong></h2> <p>Similarly, taking time to develop strong relationships with recruiters is a good investment of your time. Find out which agencies your industry respects and uses, and work hard to get to meet them so you can talk about what you have to offer and what you want to get from your next role. Sometimes the small boutique agencies can offer a more personalised service, and also give you useful feedback on the market trends and what employers are looking for.</p> <h2><strong>Stay positive</strong></h2> <p>Having an optimistic outlook will be attractive to potential employers. When times are tough, employers want team members who help maintain morale rather than contributing to the office moans. Make sure at interviews that you show how resilient you are and how you can cope with adversity.

As the riders in the women\u2019s Olympic road race waited, crammed into the customary pre-race grid, time seemed to stretch out and slowly turn to glue.

She finished 14 seconds back in fifth, without ever threatening, in the dreaded parlance, to podium.</p> <p>At the end Armitstead\u2019s looked wan and spent, but a little of the strangulating tension had passed. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/lizzie-armitsteads-home-town-rides-rio-with-her\" title=\"\">getting back to the people that love me</a>,\u201d she said \u201cYou open yourself up for judgment. I never gave up and for that I can be proud of myself.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/lizzie-armitstead-missed-drug-tests-cycling-rio-2016\">Lizzie Armitstead: \u2018Controversy didn\u2019t enter my mind once in the race\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Judgment, though, will continue. The farrago of omission and denial over those missed dope tests remains. Some will maintain that Armitstead should not have been here at all, deselected on grounds of wider propriety, of perception and timing. Others will smart at the coddled self-righteousness of her response to those missed tests being flushed out, one apparently the result of a phone being switched to silent, another a failure to tick a location box. Sympathisers will maintain that no rule of expulsion has been breached, that only three failed tests would lead to a formal case to answer. And that this is instead a morality play, a collective harrumph inspired by the darker geopolitical tension of Russia\u2019s doping scandal, the self-regarding pressure to appear whiter than white in these things.</p> <p>The same line of argument says excluding Armitstead would have been illogical. Mo Farah also missed two tests but avoided a ban a year before London 2012. Plus this has been a very public wheel of pain for an athlete who loves her sport, whose life has been measured by sacrifice and competitive anxiety since she was plucked out by British cycling, aged 10. Everything she has achieved will now come with an asterisk.</p> <p>It is possible to say Armitstead shouldn\u2019t have been at these Olympics without wishing her ill, without suggesting she is a cheat and while still feeling sympathy. It is a point that seems to have been lost in the shared animosity of the last few weeks, an anger that emerged again at the start of the race here as Armitstead\u2019s family bearded and berated at least one national newspaper journalist on the Rio beachfront.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit naive to miss three tests but it doesn\u2019t say that she\u2019s a doper,\u201d Marianne Vos, the reigning Olympic champion, said on the Rio promenade. It seems a fair if unintentionally barbed response. As far as many fellow athletes are concerned, those who also go through this gruelling process, Armitstead did fail three times, whatever her lawyers were able to establish, however the doping authorities may have failed to carry out their job to the letter. And in particular notwithstanding the lengthy dog-ate-my-testing-slot self-defence posted by Armitstead on Twitter, an act of blame-shifting that has further soured the public sympathies, shining a light into the self-absorbed and coddled private culture of elite athletes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/aug/07/road-race-cycling-olympics-lizzie-armitstead\">Brutal road race course bares its teeth but Britons are caught cold by the wind | Barry Glendenning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Detachment, solipsism, self-obsession, living in \u201cthe bubble\u201d: this is a common theme in elite professional sport. Armitstead did not create the atmosphere of hateful suspicion, the stretched sympathies that make us assume a missed test must speak to something more sinister. But she does exist within it, and with open eyes.</p> <p>In Rio the road race itself got the finish it deserved. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/lizzie-armitstrad-anna-van-der-breggen-road-race-olympics-crash-annemiek-van-vleuten\" title=\"\">Anna Van Der Breggen of Holland won gold</a> after a thrilling chase at the last, the endgame opened up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/annemiek-van-vleuten-intensive-care-olympic-road-race\" title=\"\">a horrific crash suffered by her team-mate Annemiek van Vleuten</a> in the final descent. Van Der Breggen collapsed at the end as she tumbled off her bike, exhausted and exhilarated by a genuinely stirring piece of racing. For Armitstead, the opportunity to shrink from the light for a while will be gratefully seized. It has been a genuinely painful trial by omission, a tale of carelessness and suspicion from which nobody emerges with credit.</p>"
