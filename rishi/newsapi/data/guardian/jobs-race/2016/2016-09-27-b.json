  "<p>Swansea City\u2019s American owners are flying in to watch the home match against Liverpool on Saturday in what is seen as a pivotal game for Francesco Guidolin, who is clinging on to his job as manager.</p> <p>Swansea have picked up only point since winning at Burnley on the opening day and Guidolin\u2019s position is becoming close to untenable after it emerged that Bob Bradley, a former USA coach, had met Huw Jenkins, the Welsh club\u2019s chairman.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/swansea-city-francesco-guidolin-signs-new-contract\">Swansea City head coach Francesco Guidolin signs new two-year contract</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, who took control at Swansea in July, had always planned to come over for the Liverpool fixture, their visit has taken on greater significance in light of the team\u2019s poor results and Guidolin\u2019s situation. Jenkins, who continues to run the club on a day-to-day basis, has already considered a move for Ryan Giggs and it increasingly seems like a matter of when, not if, Guidolin is dismissed.</p> <p>Swansea\u2019s owners did not want to be seen as making a knee-jerk decision so soon after taking over at the club and were prepared to give Guidolin a bit more time. There were some positive signs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/24/swansea-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">during the 3-1 defeat at home against Manchester City on Saturday</a>, when Swansea produced some of their best football for a long time, yet the harsh reality is that it was a fourth defeat in five matches.</p> <p>A similar result against Liverpool may well see Guidolin relieved of his duties, less than five months after he was given a two-year contract, and enable Swansea to make an appointment during the international break.</p> <p>The club are anxious to avoid a repeat of the situation in which they found themselves when Garry Monk was sacked in December last year. On that occasion there was a protracted search for a new manager and Alan Curtis, who remains at the club, was later given the job on a temporary basis before Guidolin was brought in.</p> <p>In terms of the current short-list, Bradley, who is in charge of Le&#xa0;Havre in France, is firmly in the running along with Giggs, but Swansea are believed to have other names under consideration as well.</p>",

Remember folks, the FA are the \u201cguardians of the game.\u201d Jesus wept.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>Just how hard was that decision, given it has come so soon in Sam\u2019s reign?</strong></em></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a really painful decision because obviously we\u2019ve only just hired Sam, and Sam we think is a great fit for England manager and we think could have been extremely successful. But The FA is more than just running the England men\u2019s team. We have to stand up for the right behaviours across the whole game.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the guardians of the game \u2013 we set the rules and we have to be seen to apply those rules consistently and evenly, whether you are the England manager or someone low down in the organisation.</p> <p>\u201cThat consistency, that trust that people have in us to behave in the appropriate manner, is core to what any football association is about and certainly true of the English football association. It\u2019s a painful decision because we thought he was a great manager, but it\u2019s the right decision if we are to protect the integrity of The FA.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>It is a mutual decision. How has Sam taken the news?</strong></em></p> <p>\u201cSam is absolutely distraught. He recognises that he made a terrible error of judgement and I think that he recognises as well that, whilst it\u2019s a tough decision that The FA is taking, he can see that at least we have a point.</p> <p>\u201cOnce again, I have to say how personally disappointed I am. I thought Sam had already made a big difference to The FA \u2013 he came to St. George\u2019s Park and showed real leadership there and had clear enthusiasm for the job at hand.</p> <p>\u201cI know personally that he is deeply, deeply upset and deeply regrets the error of judgement but I also think that he understands why The FA has had to take this tough decision.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>What happens next? The squad, of course, is due to meet up in less than a week ahead of the games against Malta and Slovenia.</strong></em></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in good hands. Gareth Southgate, the under-21 coach who has got really good international experience and Premier League experience, will take charge of the team for the next four games, from Malta through to the friendly against Spain.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s got good back-office support and we\u2019ll be having a planning meeting with him later on this week, and we plan to go and win those games.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>In terms of securing a permanent replacement, how will that process work?</strong></em></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a busy 24 hours, so you might imagine that we haven\u2019t got a process in place but job one is to secure the England team, which with Gareth we are doing.</p> <p>\u201cJob two is to reflect on what lessons need to be learned from what we\u2019ve just gone through and how that might approach a new search \u2013 but I think the criteria of the person we\u2019re looking for will stay the same.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge is, with a very talented group of England players, how do you get the best out of them in tournaments? That\u2019s still the job to be done.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T19:54:58.957Z\">at 8.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57eacacce4b091b7fa2b5ba3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T19:43:56.475Z\">8.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>With all this excitement</strong>, you might forget that it\u2019s a Champions League night.

We would expect the FA \u2013 and any clubs implicated \u2013 to launch an immediate and independent investigation in response to any substantiated allegations to help keep the game clean in this country. During such investigations, organisations typically suspend employees against whom there is credible evidence, and cooperate fully with the authorities if there has been wrongdoing. </p> <p>If there has been a breach of the Bribery Act, an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office should follow, and in such an investigation affected entities would come under scrutiny to demonstrate that they had in place adequate procedures to prevent bribery.

His film in question, Elle, does star Isabelle Huppert, one of the most celebrated actors of all time - but the thriller, about a steely businesswoman caught in a game of cat and mouse with her rapist, refuses to tone down the director\u2019s confrontational style. In France, where the film opened in May following its debut at the Cannes film festival, there was nary a hint of controversy. That\u2019s likely to change when Elle arrives on these shores on 11 November.</p> <p>It\u2019s notable that instead of going with Fran\u00e7ois Ozon\u2019s Frantz, a period war drama that plays more to the Academy\u2019s often cautious sensibilities, France went for this year\u2019s most button-pushing Cannes selection (each country can only nominate a single film). Verhoeven, who is from the Netherlands, has made fewer films than Ozon over the course of his career, but he\u2019s indisputably better known, and his film higher profile \u2013 all of which highlights a trend that\u2019s emerged in this year\u2019s race for the foreign award.</p> <p>Frequent competitors - such as France, Spain, Iran, South Korea and Chile - have opted to bank on festival favorites from directors with significant art-house clout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30343203ae80027a29a987330a2bfeb3d0681579\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30343203ae80027a29a987330a2bfeb3d0681579/74_0_2252_1351/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain\u2019s pony, Julieta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain\u2019s pony, Julieta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As tried-and-tested as this method of attack sounds, it\u2019s in fact not a given occurrence.

With Spain\u2019s decision to support his latest melodrama, Julieta, that tally has now grown to six. It marks the first time Almod\u00f3var\u2019s been nominated by his country since 2006\u2019s Volver, despite the fact his fans in Spain largely shunned the drama, resulting in smaller-than-average homespun numbers for the prolific director. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/09/fire-at-sea-review-masterly-and-moving-look-at-the-migrant-crisis\">Fire at Sea review \u2013 masterly and moving look at the migrant crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Similar to Spain, Italy doesn\u2019t seem too concerned with box office clout, having chosen Gianfranco Rosi\u2019s refugee-crisis-themed documentary Fire at Sea over some of the country\u2019s splashier, star-driven output. The film <a href=\"http://www.screendaily.com/news/migrant-doc-fire-at-sea-gets-box-office-boost-after-berlin-win/5100871.article\">opened to paltry figures</a> in Italy over the spring. What seems to matter for Spain, however, is that the film has a proven hit at festivals, having won the Golden Bear at the Berlin international film festival (a rare feat for a documentary) and garnered acclaim at several more.</p> <p>Germany and Chile have followed suit, placing their hopes in Maren Ade\u2019s Cannes favorite Toni Erdmann and Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s festival darling Neruda, respectively. Ade isn\u2019t as established as the bulk of directors vying for the prize, having helmed four features prior to the family comedy, but as many critics would wager, Toni Erdmann is distinctive enough to warrant her the auteur moniker.</p> <p>The same goes for Larra\u00edn, who is in the midst of a remarkable run this year, having premiered Neruda, his metafictional portrait of the celebrated poet and politician Pablo Neruda, at Cannes, followed mere months later by the debut of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/13/jackie-review-natalie-portman-kennedy-jfk\">Jackie</a> at Venice. Both films confirm him as a world-class film-maker.</p> <p>Other big-name players in the mix this year include South Korea\u2019s Kim Jee-woon (The Age of Shadows), the Iranian Oscar winner Asghar Farhadi (The Salesman), Canada\u2019s wunderkind Xavier Dolan (It\u2019s Only the End of the World), and the Philippines\u2019 Brilliante Mendoza (Ma\u2019 Rosa).

He now faces the prospect of losing the position after only one match in charge.</p> <p>The governing body is still awaiting a full transcript and all the relevant footage from the Daily Telegraph as it determines how to proceed but has been dismayed by what has been revealed so far. \u201cWe are still in the process of establishing the facts before making a decision,\u201d said Clarke when contacted by the Guardian on Tuesday morning. Allardyce, who left his home in Bolton just before 7am to travel south, is due to give his side of the story at Wembley but appears to be fighting to retain his job.</p> <p>The 61-year-old, accompanied by his agent Mark Curtis and his financial adviser Shane Moloney, was recorded commenting on a variety of subjects from England players to regulations, his predecessor Roy Hodgson and the FA\u2019s decision to redevelop Wembley. But it was his comments on third-party ownership, and whether he was offering advice on bypassing \u201cridiculous\u201d FA and Fifa rules, which have caused real alarm. He is filmed telling the undercover reporters, posing as businessmen, that it was \u201cnot a problem\u201d to get around FA rules, imposed in 2008, which prevent parties \u201cowning\u201d football players\u2019 economic rights.

  "<p>A week is a long time in running. Or, to be more precise, a week is long time if you are planning to run pretty much continually throughout it. After a few rash decisions and some naive optimism, I am now in the Gobi desert in China, about to face this exciting, if somewhat daunting, prospect.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.utgchina.com.cn/ls_en/news.jsf?c=5010294\">Ultra Trail of the Gobi</a> (UTG) describes itself as a 400km (250-mile) single-stage, self-navigated, self-supported race. Loosely based on the journey of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuanzang#Pilgrimage\">seventh-century Buddhist monk Xuanzang</a> (he took several years), the route passes some truly inhospitable terrain in Gansu Province. In his records, Xuanzang describes it as a place that contains \u201cnothing but barren sand and dry river beds\u201d, where \u201cwhen it is hot, the heat sears you like a flame; when it is cold, the wind cuts your flesh like a knife\u201d. Based on information from someone who has checked out the course, it doesn\u2019t sound as if much has changed in the past 1,400 years. During this race, the 49 other competitors and I will have to battle with temperatures ranging from -20C to 30C, avoid underfed wild dogs and wolves and face a 3000-metre mountain thrown in for good measure. The cut-off time is 150 hours \u2013 and the clock runs continuously.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2014/apr/14/marathon-des-sables-finishing-the-race\">Marathon des Sables: toenails gone, friends made and a race complete</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UTG is part of a growing trend among runners to experiment with just how far they can physically go. Twenty years ago, people might have been impressed with a marathon, but since then, distance inflation has been rampant. Much as most long-distance runners hate to admit it, impressing others can\u2019t be ignored as a motivation and, when a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/20/eddie-izzard-tired-yet-triumphant-after-running-27-marathons-in-27-days\">slightly overweight, middle-aged standup comedian ran 27 marathons in 27 days</a>, they ceased to produce the requisite awe.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising therefore that ultramarathons (technically anything more than 26.2 miles) have been rising in popularity over the past decade. In the US, the number of runners completing races of more than 50km (31 miles) rose from roughly 11,000 in 2000, to more than 72,000 last year.</p> <p>In the UK, there has also been an explosion in the number of \u201cultras\u201d, with many selling out at the speed of Glastonbury tickets. With a growing middle class, China has also seen the races\u2019 popularity rising fast in recent years; it seems life has to be quite comfortable before one voluntarily choses to make it uncomfortable.</p> <p>The UTG is in its own league of \u201csuper ultra\u201d races.

The advice I received from others who had done similar events was simply to run as much as possible. With an 11km plod to and from work and a couple of long runs on the weekend, I was able to build up to 120-150km a week quite quickly but, between work and travelling, I struggled to go much beyond that.</p> <p>Food, both the eating of it and the planning of it, was the other priority. While training, I discovered a new appreciation of all-you-can-eat restaurants. For the actual race, the rules require competitors to bring 25,000 calories, most of which can be placed in drop bags along the course. In the past I\u2019ve found most energy bars too sweet and synthetic, but recently I\u2019ve been fortunate to discover <a href=\"https://wearetribe.co/\">some people in London</a> making sports food out of beetroot, goji berries and just about every other \u201csuperfood\u201d you can imagine.</p> <p>My medical certification for the UTG wasn\u2019t without complications. In February, I visited a doctor in Kathmandu for a routine checkup. Much to my, and I think his, surprise, he found a large hole in my heart. One open-heart surgery, a week in hospital and three months of impatient recovery later, and I was back to running again, a little out of shape, but now with the advantage of a fully functional heart.</p> <p>Joining me in the Gobi will be an impressive bunch of experienced masochists.

He showed that, across the world, average IQs had risen by roughly three percentage points every decade since at least 1930, and probably much longer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/23/james-flynn-iq-scores-environment\">James Flynn: IQ may go up as well as down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since evolution doesn\u2019t work fast enough to produce genetic upgrading on that scale, it seemed that environment must be the dominant influence. According to Flynn, rising IQs went hand-in-hand with modernisation, which involves more years of education and more jobs that require analytic abilities and abstract thinking. The belief that better schooling, and positive discrimination in favour of disadvantaged children, could make a difference was seemingly vindicated.</p> <p>The view, put forward by a number of British and American academics at that time, that black people\u2019s IQs were genetically inferior to those of whites and Asians was finally discredited. So was the idea that African countries were poor because their inhabitants were stupid. IQs in developing countries also rise as they modernise and will eventually catch up those in developed countries. Best of all, rising IQs led to better moral reasoning, putting racism and sexism on the defensive.</p> <p>Nearly all psychologists now accept what they call \u201cthe Flynn effect\u201d, a remarkable accolade for a man who isn\u2019t even a specialist in psychology, his academic subject being political studies. This is not the only reason to admire \u201cJim\u201d, as family and friends call him. He is also an ardent democratic socialist who left an academic career in the US because he believed he was held back by his political views and his activity in the civil rights movement. He exiled himself to New Zealand in the 1960s, becoming a professor at the University of Otago in Dunedin. There, he helped found the Alliance party, and stood unsuccessfully for parliament against the local version of New Labour. He named his son, Victor, now an Oxford maths professor, after Eugene Victor Debs, five times presidential candidate for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/26/american-socialism-history-john-nichols\">Socialist Party of America</a>.</p> <p>This, I think, as we sit in Victor\u2019s garden, is like meeting Einstein or Freud, men who changed for ever the way we see the world. Flynn, now 82, speaks fluently and wittily in Irish-American cadences (his grandfather, a teacher, fled the 19th-century Great Hunger in Ireland). He runs twice a day \u201cthough not as fast as I did 10 years ago\u201d. He still teaches four-fifths of a timetable at Otago and writes nearly a book a year.</p> <p>We are here to talk about his latest book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/does-your-family-make-you-smarter.html\">Does Your Family Make You Smarter?</a> Having explored IQ differences between generations, he has turned his attention to those within generations, which is a different matter. It is already evident to me, after reading the book, that the Flynn effect doesn\u2019t settle as much as some of us thought or hoped it did. And that by 21st-century standards, perhaps Flynn doesn\u2019t quite measure up as a liberal hero.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/18/psychologist-robert-plomin-says-genes-crucial-education\">Psychologist on a mission to give every child a Learning Chip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The answer to the question in the title, Flynn explains, is that your family environment\u2019s effect on your IQ almost disappears by the age of 17. An important exception is in the vocabulary component of IQ tests, where the effect persists into the mid-20s and can make a big difference, at least in the US, to the chances of getting into a top university. The home has most influence in early childhood but is swamped by later environments at school, university and work. And they will more closely match your genes because you will seek out (and be chosen for) environments that match your \u201cgenetic potential\u201d, whether it\u2019s basketball, carpentry or mathematics.</p> <p>So having taken genes out of the equation, Flynn has apparently put them back in. Nurture hasn\u2019t won after all. Over the years, a modernised environment will raise everyone\u2019s game. But within each generation, the gap between groups \u2013 classes, races, genders \u2013 can, at least theoretically, remain the same as they were. In practice, groups previously excluded from full access to education and professional careers will close the gap.</p> <p>Flynn emphasises that a rise in the potency of genes isn\u2019t matched by a corresponding decline in the potency of environment: \u201cThe potency of one is added to the potency of the other.\u201d Moreover, 20% of IQ differences are attributable to neither environment nor genes but to \u201cchance factors\u201d of which our ability to improve ourselves is the most important.</p> <p>\u201cYou can be at the 98th percentile [more intelligent than all but 2% of the population],\u201d he says. \u201cAt school, you kick teachers in the ankles, don\u2019t hand in your homework, get into fights and end up being suspended. You become a bricklayer in a humdrum environment and it costs you, say, 10 IQ points. Then you think: to hell with this, all these guys talk about is girls and football, I\u2019m going to university. Your IQ could rise from 120 to 130 and you\u2019ve leapfrogged four-fifths of the people ahead of you.\u201d</p> <p>We are talking averages, of course. So I ignore the implied slur on bricklayers, accept the good news \u2013 that free will has a significant role \u2013 and move on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/02/highereducationprofile.highereducation\">Interview: the moral philosopher James Flynn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If we are all getting brighter and better at moral reasoning, how does Flynn account for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>? \u201cThe rise of visual culture means far fewer people read serious novels and history.

It was, after all, to challenge the late Arthur Jensen, professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley \u2013 who claimed the genes of African Americans were responsible for their inferior IQ scores \u2013 that Flynn began to examine the evidence on intelligence. But a sentence from his new book is nagging away at me. American blacks, it says, \u201ccome from a cognitively restricted subculture\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/may/11/art1\">Andrew Anthony on the IQ test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is hugely sensitive territory because, while it may be good to say genes don\u2019t make people stupid, it isn\u2019t so good to tell anyone their way of life does. Flynn, however, makes no apologies. \u201cIt\u2019s whites, not blacks, who complain,\u201d he says. \u201cBlacks know the score. Facts are facts.\u201d On recorded IQ tests, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2001.tb00094.x/abstract;jsessionid=226D014DD28030FEE539382A9DDF40D6.f03t04\">he says</a>, African Americans have <a href=\"http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/2006%20PSnew.pdf\">persistently lagged behind [pdf]</a> most other <a href=\"http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/PPPL1.pdf\">ethnicities in America [pdf]</a> (including, according to some commentators, <a href=\"http://www.unz.com/article/the-iq-gap-is-no-longer-a-black-and-white-issue/\">black immigrants</a> from, for example, the Caribbean) and this cannot be explained by the Flynn effect since, as he puts it, \u201cblacks don\u2019t live in a time warp\u201d.</p> <p>He then tells what sounds like a version of those dodgy jokes about the Irishman, the Scotsman and the Englishman. Except this isn\u2019t a joke. \u201cGo to the American suburbs one evening,\u201d says Flynn, \u201cand find three professors. The Chinese professor\u2019s kids immediately do their homework. The Jewish professor\u2019s kids have to be yelled at. The black professor says: \u2018Why don\u2019t we go out and shoot a few baskets?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>As I emit a liberal gasp, he continues: \u201cThe parenting is worse in black homes, even when you equate them for socio-economic status. In the late 1970s, an <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1986-24139-001\">experiment</a> took 46 black adoptees and gave half to black professional families and half to white professionals with all the mothers having 16 years of education. When their IQs were tested at eight-and-a-half, the white-raised kids were 13.5 IQ points ahead. The mothers were asked to do problem-solving with their children. Universally, the blacks were impatient, the whites encouraging. Immediate achievement is rewarded in black subculture but not long-term achievement where you have to forgo immediate gratification.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/19/america-schools-segregation-race-class-education-policy-bobby-scott\">America's schools are still segregated by race and class.

By 11, the two groups had identical average IQs. In Germany, there was no black subculture.\u201d</p> <p>Flynn refuses to speculate about the lingering effects of slavery and subsequent discrimination that have prevented African Americans from entering colleges and professional careers. Universities, he thinks, should do more research on racial differences and a new version of that 1970s study. \u201cI have shown \u2013 this wicked person who actually looks at the evidence \u2013 that <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.abstract\">blacks gained 5.5 IQ points on whites</a> between 1972 and 2002. There\u2019s been no changes in family structure [the incidence of single-parent families], no gains in income. I suspect it\u2019s an improvement in parenting. But I can\u2019t prove it.\u201d</p> <p>I leave that sunlit garden in a troubled frame of mind. Flynn has made a great contribution to human knowledge and understanding. But he hasn\u2019t settled the nature-against-nurture debate \u2013 and I wonder if he is now muddying the waters, constructing theories about parenting from flimsy evidence.</p>",

His most aggressive attacks had Clinton appealing to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/debate-fact-check-trump-clinton-live-quotes-hofstra\">fact checkers</a>\u201d instead of offering rebuttals.</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s performance was magisterial. She slipped easily into the details of many policy areas \u2013 cyber warfare, community policing, paid family leave \u2013 that Trump could not touch.</li> <li>Clinton also scored the biggest moment of wit, at the end of a long Trump boast about his temperament, which he delivered hotly. \u201cWhew, OK!\u201d she said when he was through, smiling.</li> <li>Clinton flayed Trump on his refusal to release his tax returns, on his \u201clong record\u201d of \u201cracist behavior,\u201d on his lack of knowledge about the deal to withdraw US troops from Iraq, on climate change being a Chinese \u201choax,\u201d and on and on. But his best line was: \u201cHillary\u2019s got experience but it\u2019s bad experience.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s best line (apart from \u201cwhew, OK!\u201d): \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</li> <li>Clinton\u2019s runner-up best line, in reply to a Trump charge that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on your ideas\u201d, was: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t paid your taxes!\u201d</li> <li>There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/sep/26/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-presidential-debate-live?page=with:block-57e9cf34e4b0a785ec48bcd8#liveblog-navigation\">lots of manterruptions</a>. Trump also had the sniffles.</li> <li>Trump lost altitude quickly after the first half hour, shifting from pointed interruptions to a more incoherent, sloppy pattern of interruption. </li> <li>Trump tried to deny five years of spreading birtherism \u2013 the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born outside the US. Clinton replied sharply: \u201cIt can\u2019t be dismissed that easily ... He has a long record in engaging in racist behavior.\u201d</li> <li>Trump cast doubt on the notion that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee was Russia-backed. He said it may have been China, or bizarrely, a \u201c400lb person sitting on their bed\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton said neighborhood security would come from community policing and getting guns off streets while Trump called for \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d.</li> <li>Clinton poked fun at Trump\u2019s unlimited indictment of her record. \u201cI have a feeling that by the end of this evening everything is going to be my fault,\u201d she said.

As always, Karen Walker, the sardonic troublemaker who is the lone Trump supporter, gets all the best lines.</p> <p>\u201cYou know Donald is one of my oldest friends. I helped him pick out Melania!\u201d she says.</p> <p>They talk about immigration and Latinos, and Karen, speaking about her maid Rosario (who was revealed as undocumented immigrant during the show), quips: \u201cShe owes me, I sent her to college.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sent her to Trump University! To study dusting!\u201d says Will.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what they teach,\u201d replies Karen.</p> <p>In the show, Karen had supposedly shot at Rosario, but that just became a comment about gun control.</p> <p>\u201cIf Crooked Hillary had her way, I wouldn\u2019t have that gun and I\u2019d have to use my cannon and Rosario would be dead,\u201d said Karen.</p> <p>When Will complains that Trump uses hateful language to talk about people, Karen turns to Grace.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear what your pussy gay Muslim boyfriend just said?\u201d she asks.</p> <p>Will\u2019s friend Jack stars as the undecided voter who is considering not bothering to cast a ballot in November.</p> <p>\u201cBut does my vote even matter? How can one unemployed white fella registered in Pennsylvania make a difference?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>Grace attempts to appeal as Clinton being the first female president. But Jack isn\u2019t convinced, saying he hasn\u2019t heard \u201cthe one thing that will convince me to vote for one candidate over the other\u201d.</p> <p>But Will knows exactly what to stay to win over the urban gay Jack. \u201cKaty Perry likes Hillary,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the end of the \u201cepisode\u201d, the words #votehoney appears.

The money was delivered as foreign currency because US law bars any transaction in US dollars and sanctions make bank transactions difficult.</p> <p>The US is not giving any of its own money to Iran as part of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-expected-to-be-announced-in-vienna\">international nuclear arms deal</a> meant to prevent the construction of weapons.

Sanctions related to human rights, terrorism and other issues remain in place and still lock Iran out of billions.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s guess of how much Iran will benefit by unfrozen assets is far higher than most experts\u2019 estimates, though not inconceivable. Treasury secretary Jack Lew has <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?327246-1/secretaries-kerry-moniz-lew-testimony-iran-nuclear-agreement\">put the number at $56bn</a>, and Iranian officials have said <a href=\"http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2016/01/19/446415/Iran-32bn-unfrozen-assets\">$32bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-claims-100-billion-now-freed-in-major-step-as-sanctions-roll-back/2016/02/01/edfc23ca-c8e5-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html\">$100bn</a>.

In 2015, Chicago had 2,988 people who were victims of gun violence, according to <a href=\"http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/shootings/\">the Chicago Tribune</a>, and 488 homicides in all.

One research paper, unpublished through peer review, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/08/20/ray-kelly-says-stop-frisk-saves-lives-theres-no-good-evidence-for-that/\">found modest drops</a> in some crimes. A<a href=\"http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/rosenfeld_fornango.pdf\"> second paper</a>, published through peer review, found problems in the first study and \u201cfew significant effects\u201d of the tactic.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nyclu.org/publications/report-stop-and-frisk-during-bloomberg-administration-2002-2013-2014\">New York Civil Liberties Union report</a>, on 12 years\u2019 worth of police data, found young black and Hispanic men were targeted for stops at a vastly higher proportion than white men: more than half the people searched were black and about 30% were Hispanic. Among more than 5m stops during the Bloomberg administration, police found a gun less than 0.02% of the time, according to the report. NYPD <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/08/new_york_s_stop_and_frisk_policy_is_neither_effective_nor_constitutional.html\">records between 2004 and 2012</a> show similar figures: in 4.4m stops, weapons were seized from 1.0% of black people, 1.1% from Hispanic people and 1.4% of white people.</p> <p>New York\u2019s long-term decline in crime rates began before Giuliani took office in the 1994, and<a href=\"http://www.city-journal.org/html/how-new-york-became-safe-full-story-13197.html\"> its causes were and are diverse</a>: data-driven policing <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/inside-look-system-cut-crime-new-york-75-percent-n557031\">with the Compstat system</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/what-caused-crime-decline\">growth of the police force by 35%</a> over the decade, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/\">incarceration increases by 24%</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/digest/jan03/w9061.html\">the 39% unemployment decline</a> that matched with national economic growth. Not even the loudest supporters of stop and frisk, including Bloomberg, whose last term Trump has called \u201ca disaster\u201d, have argued the tactic alone reduced crime to its current lows.</p> <p>Trump said that the tactic was not ruled unconstitutional because of a judge \u201cwho was against policing\u201d, but his personal opinion about the judge does not mean she did not rule it unconstitutional.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWe have to take the guns away from the people that shouldn\u2019t have them \u2026 these are bad people.\u201d</strong><br></p> <p>This argument flies in the face of Trump\u2019s pro-gun rights stance for legal owners; he has repeatedly and falsely insisted that Clinton wants to take away guns from legal owners.</p> <p>Trump claimed that New York\u2019s crime rate is up since the end of stop and frisk. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/nyregion/anxiety-aside-new-york-sees-drop-in-crime.html\">It remains near historic lows</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/loisbeckett/status/780593501411151873\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No, murders in New York City are not up this year.

Economists still debate the effect of the deal on jobs, since US trade with Canada and Mexico is modest at best. In 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/06/22/483100251/fact-check-trumps-speech-on-clinton-annotated\">Congressional Research Service wrote</a>: \u201cNafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturing is down 37% <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP\"> since its peak in 1979</a>, but this change has a great deal to do with the general shift toward a service-based economy, which the US has had surpluses in in recent years. It\u2019s true that many manufacturing jobs have been outsourced, especially since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it\u2019s also true that the US has added more than 800,000 factory jobs since 2010.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cMy father gave me a small loan in 1975.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump never struggled for money or started with anything modest. In 1978 his father gave him a loan totaling almost $1m \u2013 about $3.7m today \u2013 and acted as guarantor for the young Trump\u2019s early projects. A 1981 <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/301761265/Report-on-Donald-Trump-to-Casino-Control-Commission\">report by a New Jersey regulator</a> also shows a $7.5m loan from the patriarch, and years later he<a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">bought $3.5m in gambling chips</a> to help his son pay off the debts of a failing casino, which was <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/1991-04-09/news/25780577_1_casino-control-act-donald-trump-casino-owners\">found to have broken the law by accepting them</a>. Trump also <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/christophermassie/donald-trump-in-deposition-96-million-i-borrowed-from-dads-e?utm_term=.eboXJGMWG#.qbNV4Jl1J\">borrowed millions against his inheritance</a> before his father\u2019s death, a 2007 deposition shows.</p> <p>Trump has not proven that he is worth $10bn, though his tax returns, which he has refused to release, could provide a clearer picture of his worth. His financial filings suggest he has<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/self-financing-campaign-all-the-way-would-have-been-a-stretch-for-trump-1463341722\"> less than $250m in liquid assets</a>, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. Trump has a history of overstating his properties: he has, for instance, told the FEC that a New York golf club is worth $50m but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/12/donald-trump-briarcliff-manor-golf-course-tax\">argued in court that it is worth only $1.4m</a>.</p> <p><strong>\u201cDonald is one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton is correct, and Trump unrepentant. In a video made in 2006 for his defunct and legally embattled Trump University, Trump said he hoped for a real estate \u201cbubble burst\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy\u201d property and \u201cmake a lot of money,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s called business by the way,\u201d Trump interrupted Clinton.</p> <p>Clinton: \u201cDonald says climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese.\u201d</p> <p>Trump: \u201cI did not, I do not say that.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did say that, in a 2012 tweet, right here: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.</p>&mdash; Donald J.

Don\u2019t take my word for it (you probably wouldn\u2019t if I was reading this aloud) - this is based on a <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051216\">study</a> into human voice pitch research conducted in 2012. The methodology couldn\u2019t be more relevant to this debate.</p> <p>In the study, 10 women and 10 men were recorded saying the phrase \u201cI urge you to vote for me this November\u201d - a sentence that\u2019s about elections and yet is politically neutral. The researchers then manipulated the sounds of the recordings to be lower or higher and played them to a bunch of men and women who were asked which hypothetical candidate they\u2019d vote for. They found that male and female leaders with lower-pitched voices (ie those that are more stereotypically masculine) were preferred by both men and women.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how the authors interpreted the results: \u201cThis bias could be a consequence of lower-pitched female voices being perceived as more competent, stronger, and more trustworthy \u2026 [and] in the case of men\u2019s voices, men with lower-pitched voices are larger, stronger, and more aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>The findings can be corroborated by any woman who has ever spoken in a meeting. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10dc7e1b5cd76e0ff01c4bd959ed0e6f3bb5510f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10dc7e1b5cd76e0ff01c4bd959ed0e6f3bb5510f/0_0_2629_1578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reaction to female and male candidates compared\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reaction to female and male candidates compared</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Report</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e9be72e4b0a785ec48bc8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-27T00:35:19.010Z\">1.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ve asked for your favorite music to fact-check to.

Such a voter may not react to the same thing the crowd reacts to, the campaigns react to or, needless to say, the media reacts to. Watch and judge for yourself, America ... and the world.</p> <p>They\u2019re going to start soon. Both candidates arrive onstage as practiced debaters, though Trump does not have any experience facing just one other person.

It\u2019s also because polls, which have come to be the manna of political analysts, now offer less help in making sense of it all.</p> <p>In past elections, the polls had settled down by Labor Day. This year, they continue to point all over the place. On Sunday, a survey by the <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/09/25/yougoveconomist-poll-september-22-24-2016/\">Economist and YouGov</a> found that Hillary Clinton had a lead of 4%. Less than 24 hours later, a poll from the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/\">LA Times and USC Tracking</a> put Donald Trump 4% ahead.</p> <p>Both pollsters are considered credible, which makes this even more confusing.</p> <p>This series is intended to help you make sense of the ceaseless onslaught of numbers by taking a closer look at just one poll. But to start us off, I want to talk about a crucial tool in polling analysis: the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">average</a>.</p> <p>The site <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> (RCP) takes the average of all recent credible polls to create a moving average. Right now, RCP has Clinton with 45.9% of the vote while Trump has 43.8%, meaning that the Democratic nominee is ahead by 2.1%.</p> <p>Notice how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> aren\u2019t singing from the rooftops or gloating on Twitter? It\u2019s because 2.1% means nothing.</p> <p>It\u2019s so small, it could be down to errors in the ways that polls are conducted. It\u2019s so narrow, it could easily be reversed by individuals who change their mind or who are not honestly disclosing how they plan to vote. <br></p> <p>The takeaway? Going into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-debate-gennifer-flowers\">tonight\u2019s debate</a>, the two candidates are neck and neck.</p> <p>But how much do debates matter? As my former colleague Lauren Leatherby has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/14/hillary-clinton-polls-convention-trump-election-data\">pointed out</a>, they have hurt candidates in the polls (see Barack Obama in 2012 and George Bush in 2004). But ultimately those candidates have been able to recover by election day (see, uh, the same candidates).</p> <p>So even if tonight produces a clear loser, the November vote is not a done deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/skeptical-polling-clinton-trump-before-first-debate\">How are Clinton and Trump polling before the first debate?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e949f3e4b0a785ec48ba9f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T17:00:24.328Z\">6.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Monmouth poll: Clinton has 4-point lead over Trump</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eight hours before going toe-to-toe at the first presidential debate of the general election campaign, Hillary Clinton has a four-point lead over Donald Trump among likely voters nationwide, according to a just-released Monmouth University poll.

Libertarian party nominee Gary Johnson is polling at 8% in the survey and Green nominee Jill Stein is at 2%. Among all registered voters, and not just those most likely to vote in the upcoming election, Clinton leads with 45%, while Trump falls slightly further behind with 40% Trump.</p> <p>Among her compatriots in the Democratic party, Clinton has the support of 91% of party members, while Trump has won 85% of Republicans. This is an improvement for Trump, who previously counted only one-in-four Republican voters in his corner. Monmouth\u2019s polling suggests that independents are cutting right, supporting Trump over Clinton by 39% to 33%, a precipitous drop for the former secretary of state, who held a five-point lead among independent voters in late August.</p> <p>The generation gaps are in keeping with previous polling. Clinton leads among millennial voters under the age of 35 by 48% to Trump\u2019s 28%, while voters 35 to 54 support Trump at and Clinton at 41%. For voters older than 55, support is similarly divided, with 47% supporting Clinton and 46% supporting Trump.</p> <p>\u201cClinton\u2019s support has softened since the summer, but she has still managed to grab a share of those who tend to vote Republican,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.</p> <p>The historically unpopular major-party candidates are still viewed negatively by large majorities of the electorate. According to the survey, 36% of voters view Clinton positively, while 54% view her negatively.

Instead of one signature issue, Clinton has dozens of detailed policies on a host of subjects. It may make her a great president one day, but for now voters struggle to understand what slogans such as \u201cstronger together\u201d mean in practice. If Clinton were forced to pick one concrete thing for viewers to remember her for, what would it be?</p> <p><strong>Do you believe in globalisation?<br></strong>Over many years in public life, the former secretary of state has understandably embraced an evolving set of economic positions. But few have come further than Clinton on the subject of free trade deals and the damage they may or may not have done to American manufacturing. She says she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership now proposed by Obama, but is it a principled opposition or a mere pragmatic response to Trump? Are there limits to the benefits of globalisation for US workers?</p> <p><strong>How would your counter-terrorism policy differ from Obama\u2019s?<br></strong>In the face of continued terrorist attacks, the issue of \u201cdefending America\u201d will be top of Monday\u2019s agenda. Yet Clinton risks being caught between defending the legacy of an Obama administration in which she served and acknowledging that not everything is working out well right now. How would she defeat Islamic State? Would she be more or less hawkish in Iraq and Afghanistan? If nothing changes, then Trump may be able to pin her to a range of foreign policy failures.</p> <p><strong>Why are you so secretive?<br></strong>From <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/03/hillary-clinton-email-server-potential-vice-presidents-defend-brown-booker-becerra-perez\">emails</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-returns-campaign-pneumonia\">pneumonia</a>, Clinton has repeatedly got herself into trouble by going out of her way to hide information from the public. The obvious question is: what does she have to hide? The usual explanation is that Clinton has been on the receiving end of so many smears over the years that she has learned to be cautious, but this should also teach her to be wary of cover-ups. Why should someone who ignores medical advice to rest, or legal advice to keep email on government servers, be trusted to take wise decisions in office?</p> <p><strong>How would you reduce income inequality?<br></strong>Supporters would argue that Clinton has provided many answers to this question: from infrastructure spending and a jobs program to minimum wage increases and taxing the rich. Yet many still wonder if a campaign so heavily funded by America\u2019s rich and powerful really understands or is committed to helping its middle class. Her answers may be more nuanced than Trump\u2019s crude protectionism, but they need to cut through with voters if she is to blunt his appeal in the rust belt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/24/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate-awkward-questions\">10 awkward debate questions to put Clinton and Trump on the spot</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e94652e4b0593b3cb14e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-26T16:15:54.036Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What are the third-party candidates up to?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0616c809fe36cc82f4de448b19fda2454c10a9e4/0_0_3957_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jill Stein\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jill Stein</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derek Henkle/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will be the only two candidates to participate in tonight\u2019s presidential debate at Hofstra University on Long Island - polling limitations have limited the field to just the two major-party candidates, as has happened in every presidential debate since 1992 - but that doesn\u2019t mean that the other would-be presidents have given up on participating in some capacity.</p> <p>Former New Mexico governor and Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson will watch tonight\u2019s debate from New York City with his running mate, Bill Weld, and will be livetweeting the proceedings from Twitter\u2019s offices in Chelsea.</p> <p>Green party nominee Jill Stein, meanwhile, plans to \u201cliterally insert herself\u201d into the debate tonight, responding to each of the debate questions via Periscope livestream.

He has made a number of erratic comments appearing to suggest a cavalier approach to nuclear proliferation; he has also threatened to undermine both Nato and a longstanding commitment to non-nuclear allies in Asia. Combining all this with a general belligerence that terrifies even generals, Trump has much to do to reassure voters he is not a dangerous loose cannon.</p> <p><strong>Did you support US intervention in Iraq and Libya?<br></strong>Trump has tried to have his cake and eat it on the subject of Middle East policy, attacking Clinton for backing regime change in Iraq and Libya while implying he was opposed to both wars at the time. But though this real estate investor\u2019s foreign policy views were not then widely sought out, there is a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/25/timeline-of-trumps-comments-on-iraq-invasion-not-loud-not-strong-and-no-headlines/?postshare=7121471286662065&amp;tid=ss_tw\">plenty of evidence</a> to suggest he kept any opposition very quiet. Asked if he backed the invasion of Iraq, he said: \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why would Mexico pay for you to build a wall?<br></strong>The flagship policy of building a physical wall on the southern border is frequently embellished with a boast that Trump would make sure Mexico paid for its construction. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/31/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-president-pena-nieto-immigration\">meeting with the Mexican president</a>, however, made clear that this is highly unlikely. Trump appeared to mislead supporters almost immediately afterward and continues to ignore evidence that Mexican net migration into the US has dropped to near zero in recent years. The mechanics of his deportation policy are even vaguer.</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone you regret offending?<br></strong>An open question that could lead Trump into uncharted territory. For over a year, the Republican nominee has outraged Muslims, African Americans, women, Latinos and disabled people with a series of ever-more outrageous comments. Any attempt to hold him to account for offensive language was dismissed as mere political correctness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/07/humayun-khan-donald-trump-military-arlington-national-cemetery\">Attacking the family of a Muslim war hero</a> after the Democratic convention finally seemed to damage Trump in the polls, though, and prompted a half-apology. Who else will he say sorry to?</p> <p><strong>What evidence do you have against climate change?<br></strong>Like many Republicans, Trump has repeatedly suggested that action to prevent man-made climate change is unnecessary because he does not \u201cbelieve\u201d it is real. He is even <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/politics/scientists-open-letter-trump-climate-change/\">threatening to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord</a>. Yet in the face of overwhelming evidence from world scientists, surely the onus is now on skeptics to prove their claims with facts and numbers of their own.

The candidates may also respond to direct mentions, accusations or calumnies made by their opponent, and Holt may ask follow-up questions.</p> <p>Holt has separated the debate into three themes so nebulous as to be almost meaningless: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Direction,\u201d \u201cAchieving Prosperity\u201d and \u201cSecuring America.\u201d Whether or not these blocks are divided into 30-minute segments depends on the succinctness of the candidates\u2019 answers and Holt\u2019s willingness-slash-ability to reign them in.</p> <p><strong>Where: </strong>The debate will be held at Hofstra University on Long Island, which also hosted presidential debates in 2008 between then-Illinois senator Barack Obama and Arizona senator John McCain and in 2012 between President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.
