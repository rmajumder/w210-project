  "<p>Airbnb is planning a number of product and policy changes aimed at fighting discrimination on the short-term rental platform, but some critics say the reforms don\u2019t go far enough and will allow for continued racial prejudices.</p> <p>Airbnb \u2013 which has faced widespread backlash over hosts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/airbnbwhileblack-hashtag-highlights-potential-racial-bias-rental-app\">refusing to rent to black guests</a> \u2013 released a 30-page report on Thursday outlining new nondiscrimination policies and systems designed to address user complaints.</p> <p>The changes, which include the creation of a \u201cpermanent, full-time team\u201d dedicated to addressing bias and promoting diversity, make Airbnb the latest technology company to announce reforms in the wake of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/30/tech-companies-racial-discrimination-nextdoor-airbnb\">high-profile scandal</a> surrounding racist and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/20/twitter-vows-act-more-swiftly-banning-leslie-jones-abuser-milo-yiannopoulos\">abusive behaviors of users</a>.</p> <p>The San Francisco-based company faced intense scrutiny after black users began sharing stories of rejection using the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack. Some have said they were able to get bookings after they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/08/airbnb-service-black-people-noirbnb-noirebnb\">changed their photos</a> to white people.</p> <p>Research has backed their claims, with one Harvard University <a href=\"http://www.benedelman.org/publications/airbnb-guest-discrimination-2016-09-04.pdf\">study</a> concluding that guests with \u201cdistinctively African American names\u201d are 16% less likely to be accepted than identical guests with white-sounding names.</p> <p>CEO Brian Chesky <a href=\"http://blog.airbnb.com/an-update-on-the-airbnb-anti-discrimination-review/\">called</a> discrimination \u201cthe greatest challenge we face as a company\u201d, and Airbnb hired former US attorney general Eric Holder and former ACLU official Laura Murphy to work on the problem.</p> <p>The report, written by Murphy, said that through Airbnb\u2019s new \u201cOpen Doors\u201d initiative, \u201cif a guest is not able to book a listing because they have been discriminated against, Airbnb will ensure the guest finds a place to stay\u201d. The program will involve 24/7 personalized responses from \u201cspecially trained\u201d employees. </p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how the firm would guarantee a spot, but Airbnb said if there were no similar listing on the market, the company would \u201cidentify an alternative accommodation option\u201d.</p> <p>The firm said it would also expand an \u201cInstant Book Listings\u201d program that allows guests to immediately reserve a room without host approval.</p> <p>\u201cInstant Book reduces the potential for bias because hosts automatically accept guests who meet these objective custom settings they have put in place,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The firm also vowed to diversify its workforce. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/03/apple-diversity-report-race-gender-facebook-google\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/14/facebook-diversity-report-silicon-valley-employment\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/twitter-staff-african-american-diversity\">Twitter</a> and other Silicon Valley firms, Airbnb\u2019s critics have argued that its poor diversity record contributes to its failures to address discrimination.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/03/airbnb-diversity-isnt-just-works/\">staff</a> is <a href=\"http://blog.airbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/EEO-1-2015-2.pdf\">reported</a> to be roughly 63% white, 22% Asian, 7% Hispanic and 3% black. The report claims that nearly 10% of its US employees are from \u201cunderrepresented populations\u201d and that it intends to increase that figure to 11% by 2017.</p> <p>The company said it will also now mandate that candidate pools for senior-level positions include women and minorities.</p> <p>Academics have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/30/tech-companies-racial-discrimination-nextdoor-airbnb\">repeatedly argued</a> that an easy fix to weed out discrimination would be eliminating Airbnb profile photos and names from the selection process, so that verified users could book a stay before hosts are aware of their race. In the report, Murphy notes that anonymous tools have helped people avoid prejudice when applying for mortgages and jobs, for example. </p> <p>While the company said it would \u201cexperiment with reducing the prominence of guest photos in the booking process\u201d, the report said \u201cprofile photos are essential to Airbnb\u2019s overall mission of building a community\u201d.</p> <p>Jamila Jefferson-Jones, associate professor of law at the University Missouri, Kansas City, who has <a href=\"http://urbanlawjournal.com/shut-out-of-airbnb-a-proposal-for-remedying-housing-discrimination-in-the-modern-sharing-economy/\">written</a> about Airbnb discrimination, said it would be insufficient to simply deemphasize photos.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone is able to see the picture of the potential guest prior to whether they accept the booking, I think it\u2019s still problematic,\u201d she said, noting that black guests with names like hers will continue to face discrimination. </p> <p>Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change \u2013 which has <a href=\"http://act.colorofchange.org/sign/Airbnb-racism-discrimination-housing/?\">criticized Airbnb</a> and has met with the firm to discuss discrimination \u2013 said the company now appears to be taking the matter much more seriously.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen we approached Airbnb \u2026 the engagement was not at a high level. In many ways, we felt like they did not see this as a problem or saw this as something they could wish away,\u201d said Robinson, noting that black members of his organization\u2019s board had personal experiences with discrimination on the platform.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been a very different engagement \u2026 and we\u2019re hoping that that this does address the problem,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If the startup can find a way to effectively combat bias while keeping photos in place, Robinson said he would support the changes.</p> <p>\u201cResults are results. The metric of success here is less discrimination and dehumanizing treatment of black folks and other people of color.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The cover of Jack White\u2019s first ever career-spanning compilation seems significant. Long-term watchers of the former White Stripe\u2019s career might sigh: so what else is new? Virtually every album White has released thus far has come wrapped in a sleeve rich in meaningful imagery: the crowds of shadowy photographers supposedly representing the White Stripes\u2019 conflicted attitude to fame on 2001\u2019s White Blood Cells; the shot of him brooding, with a vulture on his shoulder, that heralded his post-divorce solo debut Blunderbuss. But what\u2019s striking about the cover of Acoustic Recordings 1998-2016 is that there\u2019s nothing striking about it at all. White is dressed, for once, like a relatively normal human being: not a pearly king outfit nor gaucho hat in sight. There are no props laden with oblique import, no animals. Just White, looking a little pensive in front of a microphone, guitar in hand. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"550b27004b016423fc020175e8daae12636affe6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/550b27004b016423fc020175e8daae12636affe6/0_0_1200_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack White Acoustic Recordings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"889\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No gaucho hat, Jack? The cover of Jack White Acoustic Recordings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Record Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The implication is that what the listener will get over the course of the compilation is the real, unadorned deal, stripped of the kind of artifice that led the singer to spend years only dressing in certain colours, or pretending his ex-wife was his sister. Maybe the serpentine path it picks through his past \u2013 big hits largely usurped by B-sides; nothing from scuzzy blues side-project the Dead Weather \u2013 is designed to reveal the man behind the self-mythologising and contrivance. </p> <p>Or maybe Acoustic Recordings is every bit as artfully contrived as every other Jack White project. There are certainly a lot of songs that aren\u2019t acoustic, as such \u2013 at least in the one-man-and-a-microphone style suggested by the cover \u2013 but rather full band recordings with the electric guitars mixed out. You can still faintly hear them at the start of Carolina Drama. One of the album\u2019s big selling points is an unreleased White Stripes track, which turns out to be nothing of the sort: City Lights is a song White started writing while the White Stripes were still a going concern, and recently finished and recorded with his current bass player Dominic Davis. </p> <p>The sleeve notes by august critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/17/greil-marcus-life-in-writing\">Greil Marcus</a> place the 26 tracks in a grand tradition of austere, sincere, unembellished music that also includes Son House\u2019s a capella <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA8-ZOuKetU\">Grinnin\u2019 in Your Face</a>. \u201cOne man against the world. And one song,\u201d White notes approvingly of the latter, a description that may well fit the Delta bluesman\u2019s stark litany of hard-won advice, but feels a stretch when applied to, say, Acoustic Recordings\u2019 Love Is the Truth, which is the music from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guNWbqPMM3w\">a Coca-Cola commercial</a> divested of its exuberant brass arrangement. One man against the world. And one song. And one advertising agency with 400 staff and offices in London, New York and Buenos Aires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Jack White\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A7JCOdAGtntpYz061NH8yX5\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Still, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that Love Is the Truth is a fabulous song: a beautifully concise burst of sunshine pop that the Turtles would have happily put their name to. In fact, Acoustic Recordings suggests that White is at his least interesting when he self-consciously attempts to lock into what Marcus calls \u201cthe whole cosmos of old American folk music\u201d. A bluegrass version of the Raconteurs\u2019 Top Yourself features White in frailty-thy-name-is-woman mode, which is never his best look, and it is substantially less potent than the original, the banjo and fiddle feeling grafted on. The folky Never Far Away, from the soundtrack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/dec/21/philipfrench\">Cold Mountain</a>, is slender, and sounds a bit like Three Blind Mice.</p> <p>The compilation does make a convincing case for Jack White the versatile pop songwriter, however. Blessed with a sweet melodic touch, he turns his hand to everything from children\u2019s songs (We\u2019re Going to Be Friends) to powerpop (recorded differently, You\u2019ve Got Her in Your Pocket could have graced a Big Star album); from epic balladry (Forever for Her Is Over for Me) to comedy. Into the last category, you might place the Beck-produced 2006 B-side Honey We Can\u2019t Afford to Look This Cheap. But once you get past the fact that the main riff keeps suggesting it\u2019s about to turn into Mungo Jerry\u2019s In the Summertime, you\u2019re left with a fantastic pen-portrait of two scam artists down on their luck, that\u2019s both genuinely funny and oddly touching: White\u2019s voice bug-eyed with indignation, the music seemingly as close to collapse as the protagonists\u2019 relationship. </p> <p>Listening to the compilation\u2019s chronologically ordered tracks, you notice that the lightness and humour that powers Honey We Can\u2019t Afford to Look This Cheap seemed to desert White around the time Meg White vacated her drum stool. Since the White Stripes\u2019 disbandment, Jack White\u2019s music has got ever more tightly coiled and self-reflexive: he seems to have saved his sense of humour for Third Man Records, a company ever ready to release albums that rotate at 3rpm, or contain tracks hidden beneath the label. </p> <p>There are certainly benefits to this new seriousness: it\u2019s hard to imagine an earlier White would have come up with something like the Raconteurs\u2019 Carolina Drama, a lengthy, brooding, powerful saga of dysfunction and violence. But you do miss the old breezy invention. There are still great songs \u2013 Just One Drink, Love Interruption, Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy \u2013 but even in their stripped-down state, you can somehow sense the painstaking labour that went into them. It is the sound of admittedly classy workmanship, from someone who used to make everything he did sound effortless. </p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s how White wants to be seen these days: a dedicated, conscientious craftsman. Who knows? A great deal has clearly changed in the 18 years that separate this compilation\u2019s opener from its closing track. One thing that hasn\u2019t, as Acoustic Recordings makes clear, is its author\u2019s desire to remain contradictory and elusive. </p>",
  "<p>Only 12 days remain until voting closes in the leadership contest between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith. Meanwhile, in places across England and Wales, a very different set of Labour politicians are grappling with the daily pressures of power. Sadiq Khan\u2019s recent win in London sealed Labour\u2019s control of all the major English cities, from Newcastle to Bristol \u2013 and the party is also in charge of sizeable places such as Hull, Oxford, Brighton and Southampton.

Labour\u2019s big hitters in city and local government often claim that they\u2019re marginalised by the party\u2019s national politicians. Just about every Labour council has to deal with ongoing austerity, changes to their funding from Whitehall are looming, and many are taking strides towards devolution. Those involved say that people at the top of the party could learn a lot, if only they would give the people who run cities the time of day, and a decent platform.</p> <p>Some of these people sound exasperated by the Smith/Corbyn battle: others, indeed, simply refuse to talk about it.

As she looks back at her party\u2019s drubbing at last year\u2019s general election, her conversational pace picks up. \u201cThere was no message of hope,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat was Labour offering us? What was going to be different? And then there was the austerity-lite message: \u2018We\u2019ll cut, but we won\u2019t cut quite as much.\u2019 That went down really badly.\u201d</p> <p>The arrival of Corbyn, I suggest, might have answered some of those points. \u201cI think it\u2019s answered some for the party membership, and the new people who\u2019ve come in,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I still think we\u2019re failing to get our message out into our communities.\u201d</p> <p>Blake has been the leader of Leeds city council since May last year, with Labour on 63 seats to the Tories\u2019 19, and the Lib Dems on nine. The financial struggle she and her colleagues are facing is mind-boggling: after cutting about \u00a3210m from the council\u2019s budgets since 2010, another \u00a3110m are yet to come.</p> <p> \u201cI\u2019m deeply frustrated about it all,\u201d she says. \u201cAngry. And then you get the deep insult of seeing other places [she means Tory-run councils, mostly in the south] gain funding because of the politics of it. We have to wake up to that, as a country.\u201d<br></p> <p>Blake is one of only two women who run big English cities (the other is Labour\u2019s Julie Dore, down the M1 in Sheffield). In last year\u2019s leadership contest, she voted for Yvette Cooper. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real gender issue in the party, I really do,\u201d she says. Her other frustration is just as plainly put. \u201cFor many, many years, local politicians in the Labour party have been saying: \u2018Listen to what we\u2019re saying.

Labour and the Tories are tied on 22 seats each, the former is in power thanks to a two-year agreement with the Lib Dems. \u201cIn new-build places, which is traditional sort of Blairite territory, we don\u2019t win,\u201d says Peter Marland, the council\u2019s Labour leader. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive issue.\u201d</p> <p>Marland is a 35-year-old native of Lancashire, with a blunt wit and a tendency to use colourful language. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a different set of problems from a traditional Labour council here,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re fast-growing. We\u2019re creating jobs. Our unemployment is 1.8%.\u201d</p> <p>But in some neighbourhoods, he says, average life expectancy is 14 years lower than it is 10 minutes down the road. \u201cAnd like a lot of places, we\u2019re having to deal with cuts,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s also a massive increase in population as well.\u201d As new arrivals come here to live, the frontier people who pitched up in the 70s and 80s are hitting old age, so spending is being squeezed at both ends of the age range. The number of local dementia diagnoses, Marland says, is going up by 40% annually, and at the same time the council is building 12 new schools a year.</p> <p>There are profound lessons in all this for Labour, but Marland says he is disappointed by the tenor of the leadership debate. \u201cThey\u2019re having a conversation with themselves, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s too mid-20th century.\u201d The actions of anti-Corbyn MPs \u201chave been bizarre, but the actions of some of the people around Corbyn have been equally bizarre\u201d. He says he is set on remaining neutral, though if he was forced to chose, he would probably vote for Smith \u2013 a matter, he says, of \u201celectability\u201d.</p> <p>But he also talks in positive terms about Corbyn. In 2015, Marland was publicly sceptical, claiming he would cost Labour \u201ccouncillors and credibility\u201d. Now, he talks energetically about local Labour membership having gone up from about 600 to 2,000. \u201cCorbyn is saying some of the things a Labour party person should be saying. Haven\u2019t people been let down by the banks? Haven\u2019t people been let down by the fact that they work fucking hard in Sports Direct, and then don\u2019t have a job?\u201d</p> <p>Milton Keynes\u2019s next elections are in 2018. Marland talks about staying in power in terms of pushing local stories, but what if it is out of his hands, and down to the party\u2019s fate nationally? He has an answer, but it sounds more like the a matter of hope than certainty. \u201cIt needn\u2019t always be about what\u2019s on the six o\u2019clock news,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re using your local power well, I genuinely think that people will support you.\u201d</p> <h2>Newcastle: \u2018The debate has sunk to lows I wouldn\u2019t have expected\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05e6546d3282dca1ebe3f00fa71e9885d1e35fe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05e6546d3282dca1ebe3f00fa71e9885d1e35fe4/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newcastle council leader Nick Forbes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newcastle council leader Nick Forbes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nick Forbes has been Labour\u2019s leader in Newcastle since the party snatched back power from the Lib Dems five years ago. He traces Labour\u2019s current national crisis back to the same time: 2010, to be exact, when Ed Miliband won the Labour leadership, without much a sense of the party taking a long, hard look at itself. Instead, he says, \u201cpeople retreated into a tribal mentality\u201d \u2013 something he says applies just as much to the current contest. \u201cIt\u2019s all seen through the lens of, \u2018Which tribe do you belong to within Labour?\u2019 not, \u2018What is the Labour party here for?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt all feels like an indulgence,\u201d he says. Like Blake, he won\u2019t be drawn on whether he will vote for Corbyn or Smith, though he uses one of the tropes favoured by people who have had enough of the leadership regime: \u201cMy view is that Labour has to be seen as a party of government, not a protest movement.\u201d</p> <p>If some of Labour\u2019s city leaders are trying to avert their eyes from the party\u2019s national problems, Forbes has no choice but to look at them closely. As well as being the leader of the Labour group of the local government association, he has just been elected as one of two representatives of city and local government on the party\u2019s national executive committee. </p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m genuinely worried about is the way the internal debate has sunk to lows that I wouldn\u2019t have expected from any political party, let alone a party that claims to be inclusive and progressive,\u201d he says. \u201cThe levels of abuse that I\u2019ve seen friends and colleagues receive has been shocking. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sadiq-khan-booed-at-jeremy-corbyn-rally-a7203241.html\">Booing Sadiq Khan?</a>  I find that absolutely appalling.\u201d</p> <p>In Newcastle, austerity is grinding on. In many of its neighbourhoods, says Forbes, Ukip has recently started coming second, and he knows why. \u201cThe cuts have provided them with a useful narrative against Labour: \u2018Why are your streets not being swept? Why can\u2019t you get a house?\u2019 We saw a lot of that in the EU referendum campaign. It was entirely predictable that people used the referendum as a cry of outrage against years of austerity.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last year, he adds, a new source of hostility to his administration has reared its head \u2013 from people within Labour whose interpretation of it as an \u201canti-austerity party\u201d sees them protesting against Labour councils.</p> <p>\u201cWe get it twice,\u201d he says. \u201cWe get it once from the government, and then we get it from certain sections of our own party, campaigning against what we\u2019re having to do.\u201d Not for the first time he sounds frustrated beyond words. \u201cWhere is the solidarity with Labour councillors who are having to make the most difficult decisions?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Small talk is a fundamental social bonding tool, passed down from our primates, according to <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S45/01/12S05/index.xml?section=topstories\" rel=\"nofollow\">a study from Princeton University</a>. The researchers have been examining how lemurs use vocalisations, akin to our chit-chat, to build familiarity and closeness. Dubbed \u201cgrooming at arm\u2019s length\u201d, humans do it too. The actual content of the exchange is not the most important part; it is the social function it serves. Small talk can offer a way into business exchanges \u2013 a safety buffer before the hard numbers and negotiation.<br></p> <p>Whether pitching for investment, winning new clients or building contacts, knowing how to connect with others through small talk can be an asset, says career coach and psychologist Salma Shah.</p> <p>Shah says: \u201cDoing business with a person carries risk and lots of unknowns; from a psychological point of view, \u2018good\u2019 small talk \u2013 when we connect with someone \u2013 makes us relax, open up and trust [...] A good conversation creates a feelgood factor and a positive emotional limbic response, which we then associate with that person.\u201d </p> <p>But there are caveats. Small talk can be a segue into big talk; but in the busy world of business, the trick is knowing when \u2013 and when not \u2013 to use it. <br></p> <h2>Use your judgment</h2> <p>Sara Trechman, co-founder of healthy snack food startup <a href=\"http://www.wellandtruly.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Well&amp;Truly</a>, secured a meeting with one of the top five supermarkets after a chance chat in a queue for coffee at a Barcelona trade show.</p> <p>Trechman says: \u201cWe talked about how long the queue was taking and places in Spain never having any change \u2013 it turned out she was a buyer for one of the top five supermarkets and it set off a business conversation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Launched in February by Trechman and her sister-in-law Maria Norrman, Well&amp;Truly has secured listings in Tesco and Whole Foods. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that starting off conversations with small talk allows us to find similarities other than business; it builds an element of common ground,\u201d Trechman says. \u201cAt the same time, you need to be able to read when investors want to get straight to the numbers, without any sort of preamble. When pitching to big supermarkets we know they\u2019re time-poor and have multiple other meetings to get through.\u201d </p> <p>For Well&amp;Truly, small talk has been a part of consolidating business relationships.</p> <h2>Have something worthwhile to say</h2> <p>David Atkinson, managing director of <a href=\"http://theymco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yorkshire Meatball Co</a>, likes business transactions to be as simple and straightforward as the meatballs his father-son business makes. \u201cHaving sold and pitched at many levels in my time in small business, I\u2019d say small talk is white noise,\u201d he says. You can begin a meeting with pleasantries, but ultimately people are busy. Atkinson says his approach has always been to know why he is talking to someone and introduce himself as having a solution to their problems.<br></p> <p>\u201cHave something worthwhile to say and make sure you are asking questions, because the more time you\u2019re chit-chatting about the weather, the less time you\u2019re learning about the person you\u2019re trying to sell to,\u201d he says. His approach has worked so far \u2013 the company is set to launch a franchise model across the UK and its products will be on the shelves of four major retailers in the coming months.<br></p> <h2>Consider the context</h2> <p>Evidently, context is everything. And so is recognising that some people do not like small talk. \u201cAlways take a steer from your potential customer if you are trying to win new business,\u201d says Shah. \u201cIf they open with small talk, then do keep it going and go at their pace.\u201d Equally, if you are with someone who just wants to keep things business only, Shah suggests mirroring their style. \u201cThis will make them feel comfortable and receptive to what you have to offer.\u201d </p> <p>Aadil Seedat, launched Greater Manchester-based <a href=\"http://www.umbrella-host.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Umbrella Host</a>, a cloud computing service, three years ago. He says throwing in the odd cheesy joke or industry pun has won him contacts and business from his target audience \u2013 web developers. \u201cThey\u2019re generally not very formal and enjoy a good laugh [...] But when delving down into figures I tend to avoid small talk because that\u2019s the time you provide your serious commercial skills and experience.\u201d <br></p> <h2>Do your research</h2> <p>Asking open-ended questions is a great way to build rapport and establish common ground, says <a href=\"https://executive-coaching.co.uk/meet-the-team/geraldine-gallacher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">executive coach Geraldine Gallagher</a>. \u201cIf I\u2019m at an event I\u2019ll ask the person why they\u2019ve come along or what they have thought of the panels so far; go into curious-mode and learn about the people you\u2019re talking to,\u201d she says. Don\u2019t overcomplicate things by going into a state of hyper-analysis which prevents you from being natural. And use your own boredom threshold as a marker of when to cut to the chase, or move on. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, small talk can be boring, and if you\u2019re bored, they\u2019re definitely bored too.\u201d </p> <p>If you are going to a business meeting, know who will be in the room and what they do by researching their backgrounds beforehand. \u201cLinkedIn is a great tool for establishing whether there is professional common ground you can mention,\u201d says Gallagher. </p> <p>She suggests some stock questions you can try: \u201cAsking about the environment you\u2019re in is a good one, especially if it\u2019s an interesting building\u201d. What is going on in the news is another solid option, as long as you aren\u2019t drawn into anything too political or religion-based. And don\u2019t make the mistake of assuming the person who brings you up to the meeting is an assistant or secretary \u2013 they could be the one running the show once you get into the boardroom \u2013 so use the elevator ride up there to build some rapport and glean information.<br></p> <p>But don\u2019t overdo it. \u201cIf you make too much small talk it can detract from your gravitas and make it sound like you\u2019re babbling,\u201d says Gallagher. Nobody wants to hear about your nightmare journey down the M6 in minute detail. </p> <p>Ultimately, remember why you\u2019re there, and make sure you get across what it is you can do for the person in front of you.<br></p> <p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>",
  "<p>When Alex Guest got a job at a digital consultancy, he decided to customise it so he could do more of the work he likes, less of what he doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI was hired as a pay-per-click manager,\u201d says Guest, who has worked for Prodo Digital for four years. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t stick to what it said on my job description. I realised there may be other, better ways to improve our clients\u2019 bottom line than the ones I was doing. These also would benefit the company and mean my tasks at work were more enjoyable.\u201d<br></p> <p>Before the 31-year-old could ask for a change in duties, Guest made use of any free online resources he could find to develop his knowledge and skills. He took online courses in the evenings, signed up for webinars at lunch and engaged with industry leaders on social media.<br></p> <p>\u201cI also learned about how other people had evolved their roles at work and broken out of their job descriptions,\u201d says Guest.<br></p> <p>After 12 months, he approached his manager, who was supportive, and Guest significantly changed his role.

It is a move away from the conventional way of hiring. </p> <p>\u201cPeople used to be recruited into a specific role and they\u2019d expect to do it for a defined period of, say, five to 10 years,\u201d says Neil Morrison, group HR director for Penguin Random House. \u201cNow, we recruit talented self-learners, people who are as adaptable, curious and creative as the industry we\u2019re in. We know that they\u2019ll come in and do one job, which then morphs into something else, so we\u2019re thinking differently about how we recruit them in the first place.\u201d <br></p> <p>Morrison points out that the company drops traditional requirements such as a degree qualification to hire the right people. However, there can be risks to this approach.<br></p> <p>\u201cWithout the structure of a job description, an employer can sometimes find that an employee will resist certain essential tasks. Equally, an employee may find that the role is not the one sold to them at interview,\u201d says Alison Treliving, labour and employment partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs.<br></p> <p>Generally speaking though, unless you or your employer substantially changes your role, you won\u2019t need to get the changes in writing (in your contract, for example). \u201cIf you want to renegotiate your tasks, you can do this at your annual appraisal,\u201d says Sajida Hussain, employment lawyer at DAC Beachcroft. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to explain why you want to make changes and if you need further training, present the business case for it.\u201d<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/may/31/change-jobs-risks-dead-end-take-career-happiness\">Why we don't change jobs enough \u2013 and why we should</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before you do that, it helps if you have some connections. Networking internally helped 35-year-old Lisa Haycox, the operations manager of Explore Learning, to get the role she wanted. She began working for the company as a tutor in 2002. </p> <p>\u201cTo change my role, I learned from my peers,\u201d says Haycox. \u201cI looked at what my colleagues were doing and asked if I could spend an hour or so with them. I then had the insights I needed to build up my own skills and approach my manager to ask to do some different tasks myself.\u201d<br></p> <p>Internal networking is a useful way of raising your profile, says Kate Griffiths-Lambeth, director of human resources at wealth manager Charles Stanley. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an employee who asked the chief executive for mentorship, for example,\u201d she said. \u201cParticipating in company-wide initiatives, such as charitable fundraising, is another way to make connections, demonstrate your interpersonal skills and show you are an asset to your employer.\u201d<br></p> <p>This could even lead to your dream job. Car enthusiast Oliver Taylor, for example, was taken on by BP as a graduate in 2007. He went from working in the research department in a junior role to becoming a chief engineer in the innovation department.<br></p> <p>\u201cFrom the start I was allowed to shape the direction of my research,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThe relationships I built with senior members of staff across the company meant I could showcase my skills and demonstrate that I was able to take on this new role.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

It would also be the first port of call for tax whistleblowers.</p> <p>Confidentiality should not obstruct parliamentary scrutiny of HMRC\u2019s sweetheart deals. It should be up to the relevant committee to decide whether any examination should be conducted in closed meetings. There is precedence for this \u2013 the intelligence and security committee can take evidence in private.</p> <p>HMRC <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmpubacc/788/788.pdf\">raises \u00a375</a> for every \u00a31 spent on investigating large businesses. So there is an unassailable case for additional investment. But not just that \u2013 staff sitting in anonymous regional offices cannot appreciate the peculiarities of local fishing, oil or agriculture, so local tax offices are key nodes in the provision of services, and must be reopened.</p> <p>The above is not a panacea for the organisation\u2019s deep-seated problems, but it would strengthen public accountability and HMRC\u2019s ability to do what it\u2019s supposed to.</p>"
