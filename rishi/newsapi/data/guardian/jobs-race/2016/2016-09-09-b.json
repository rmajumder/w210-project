  "<p>The fine playing of the oboist Neil Black, who has died aged 84, enabled him to make the most of the opportunities presented by concert life in the decades following the second world war. He joined the newly founded National Youth Orchestra in 1948, stayed for its first three years, and later became principal oboe of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1958-60). LPs were being recorded not only by symphony orchestras but also by chamber orchestras specialising in music from the 18th century and earlier \u2013 a more intimate type of performance that Black came to prefer. As a result, no oboist featured on more recordings than he did.</p> <p>With the Academy of St Martin in the Fields he recorded concertos by Vivaldi and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enFwVGCaZWQ\" title=\"\">Alan Rawsthorne</a>, Mozart\u2019s Concerto in C, and with its chamber ensemble Mozart\u2019s Oboe Quartet and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAJygA9Rhl8\" title=\"\">sonatas by Handel</a>. He was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92QOAVPYOMg\" title=\"\">principal with the English Chamber Orchestra</a> during the 1970s, 80s and most of the 90s, initially sharing the post with Peter Graeme; he recorded the Concerto for Violin and Oboe by JS Bach with Itzhak Perlman, and the concertos by Richard Strauss and Ralph Vaughan Williams, with Daniel Barenboim conducting. With the pianist Murray Perahia, Black was one of the four wind soloists from the ECO in the quintets by Mozart and Beethoven, and he played on the complete cycles of Mozart piano concertos by Perahia, Barenboim and Mitsuko Uchida. His other main chamber orchestra post was with the London Mozart Players.</p> <p>Born in Birmingham, Neil was the youngest of four children of Harold Black, one of the first consultant radiologists in Britain, and his wife, Margaret (nee Nicholson), who had been a nurse before they married. His flute-playing brother, John, 10 years his senior, advised him to take up the oboe. He started learning at the age of 11 with Lucy Vincent, first oboe in the City of Birmingham Orchestra, now the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (the first woman to hold such a position in a British orchestra), and later with Hilda Hunter, continuing during holidays from Rugby school. There he found a band, where he received encouragement, but the school provided no formal lessons.</p> <p>Despite his time in the NYO, Black did not go to a music college, but in 1952 went to Exeter College, Oxford, to study history; he retained a lifelong interest in the subject, making him a knowledgable and entertaining companion on visits to historical sites. Towards the end of his time at Oxford, a vacancy came up for second oboe in the London Symphony Orchestra. The principal, Roger Lord, suggested that Black might take it, but he declined as he had not yet completed his finals.</p> <p>After graduation he decided to have some private lessons with Terence MacDonagh, the principal in Thomas Beecham\u2019s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Black\u2019s ability was such that he was frequently booked to play beside MacDonagh in the orchestra. After six lessons MacDonagh refused to teach him any longer, with the explanation: \u201cI don\u2019t teach colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Robin O\u2019Neill, principal bassoon of the ECO, said: \u201cNeil was a dear, wise and supportive colleague. He was a master of the singing line, had an innate sense colour and of light and shade, and never played an uncommitted note \u2013 and was wonderfully collegial, witty and hilariously ironic.\u201d He was always the first to welcome a nervous new player and offer a cup of tea.</p> <p>At the Royal Academy of Music, London (1960-70), and later at the Guildhall School of Music, he taught many of today\u2019s professional players. Each June from the early 90s he taught and played at the Sarasota music festival in Florida, and he was artistic director and a jury member for the second and third Barbirolli International Oboe Competitions (2009 and 2014), held at the Erin Arts Centre, Isle of Man.</p> <p>Black became the musical director of the Kirckman Concert Society in 1998, following the death of the previous director, Geraint Jones. The organisation selects and promotes young artists of exceptional talent and provides them with a platform at a major London venue. He was also involved in the Tunnell Trust for Young Musicians. In 1989 he was appointed OBE, and he continued playing until recent years.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Janice Knight, also an oboist, whom he married in 1984; by the son and two daughters of his first marriage, to Jill Hemingsley, which ended in divorce, and by four grandchildren.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> Neil Cathcart Black, oboist, born 28 May 1932; died 14 August 2016</p>",
  "<p>The history of organised horse racing in Ireland dates back to the early 18th century, the first Irish Derby was run in 1866 and, in all, there are now nearly 2,500 races in the country each year. So it is remarkable to realise that, by one measure at least, Saturday evening\u2019s Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown will be the best race ever staged in Ireland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/12/golden-horn-frankie-dettori-irish-champion-stakes-leopardstown\">Golden Horn and Frankie Dettori survive Irish Champion Stakes inquiry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is still an outside chance that a band of rain that passed through Dublin on Friday will have an effect on the field but as things stand 13 horses are due to go to post, including one, Ebediyin, who is there only to set the pace. Of the remaining dozen, no fewer than nine have recorded at least one victory at Group One level, and six of those did so this season.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had nine Group One winners in a single race in Ireland in living memory, so I\u2019m pretty sure that it is unique,\u201d Garry O\u2019Gorman, Ireland\u2019s senior handicapper, said this week. \u201cSince 2005, there would have been an average of about three and a half horses rated 120-plus in this race each year, and an average of just less than four Group One winners. This year there are six horses rated 120-plus and nine Group One winners.</p> <p>\u201cThere were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/12/golden-horn-frankie-dettori-irish-champion-stakes-leopardstown\" title=\"\">seven Group One winners when Golden Horn won last year</a>, which was well above average, but this is even more unusual. Thirteen runners is a very big field as well, five or six would be more like the average, but it\u2019s not only very strong quantity-wise, it\u2019s also very strong in terms of quality.\u201d</p> <p>The ratings are not the only numbers that tell the tale. There are proven Group One performers in Saturday\u2019s race on offer at 33-1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/02/william-buick-eclipse-hawkbill-the-gurkha-godolphin-coolmore-sandown\" title=\"\">Hawkbill, who won a strong renewal of the Eclipse Stakes</a> barely two months ago, is a 16-1 chance, while Highland Reel, who took the King George at Ascot in late July, is available at 12-1.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like an Arc, it\u2019s a hell of a race,\u201d Charlie Appleby, Hawkbill\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a runner, I\u2019d be delighted to just stand in the paddock and watch this lovely bunch of horses all in the same race.</p> <p>\u201cOur horse has done nothing wrong and he deserves to take his chance, but when you\u2019ve won an Eclipse and you\u2019re 16-1, and there\u2019s the winner of the Prince of Wales Stakes [My Dream Boat] in there at 33-1, you know the strength and depth of the race.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/30/minding-nassau-stakes-ryan-moore-aidan-obrien-goodwood-horse-racing\">Minding proves her toughness in Nassau dogfight at Glorious Goodwood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It will take little more than two minutes for the Irish Champion to weave together strands of Classic form from England, Ireland and France, measure the season\u2019s best three-year\u2011olds against battle-hardened older horses and give the outstanding filly Minding, the Oaks and 1,000 Guineas winner, her first test against colts.</p> <p>The Classic winners lining up against her include Harzand, the Derby winner in England and Ireland, and Almanzor, who took the French Derby at Chantilly in early June, the day after Harzand\u2019s victory at Epsom. New Bay and The Grey Gatsby, the French Derby winners in 2015 and 2014 respectively, are also in the field, while Found, who beat Golden Horn, the 2015 Derby winner, in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf last November is there as well.</p> <p>The rain on Friday is not expected to have any significant effect on the ground or the shape of the race. \u201cIt\u2019s with us now and we expect it to be here for much of the afternoon before clearing out at around six this evening,\u201d Pat Keogh, Leopardstown\u2019s chief executive, said on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s the end of it and it should be good weather overnight, and 16 degrees tomorrow with a fair bit of sunshine.\u201d</p> <p>In a normal year, a dual Derby winner would be an almost automatic favourite for Saturday\u2019s race but Minding is currently the narrow market leader at 5-2, with Harzand on offer at 3-1. Almanzor, at 6-1, completes a trio of three-year-olds at the head of the betting and while this is perhaps a race to watch and savour without hoping too earnestly for a particular winner, a dominant performance from one of the Classic generation would certainly delight the purists.</p> <p>\u201cIf these horses were running in a handicap, they would be doing it on very similar terms,\u201d O\u2019Gorman says, \u201cas there\u2019s around six or seven in there who are rated very close together at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a lap of honour or a two-horse race, it is genuinely very open and some of the superlatives are appropriate, but there is no great horse in there yet. Maybe one will come out of the race on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cMinding was the best juvenile filly in Ireland for more than 30 years, but she is still only rated 120. She can\u2019t be blamed for beating the fillies that are around, but this is her chance to jump up and show she is absolutely top-notch.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you can\u2019t put a [very high] rating on a horse because of a lack of opposition. That shouldn\u2019t be a problem on Saturday.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The protest overwhelming the start of the NFL season began not with a shout or raised fist but an act so passive it was all but invisible to the thousands who were there. On the night of 26 August, San Francisco 49ers quarterback <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/27/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest\">Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem</a> before the team\u2019s pre-season game against the Green Bay Packers. His defiance was nearly impossible to discern as he sat surrounded by Gatorade containers on the team\u2019s bench. It might have been missed altogether had a reporter from the NFL Network not noticed and asked him about it after the game.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem\">told the NFL Network that night.</a> \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d</p> <p>A firestorm ensued, igniting a national debate about racial inequality, police brutality and the meaning of the American flag. Kaepernick, a fading football star who had never seemed political, instantly became a nationally polarizing figure, much as Muhammad Ali had been when he refused to fight in the Vietnam war. </p> <p>While some fans torched Kaepernick\u2019s jersey, thousands more flocked to buy it \u2013 his shirt is currently the <a href=\"http://www.nflshop.com/Jerseys/pg/1/ps/96/so/top_sellers\">top seller</a> on the NFL\u2019s website. As many labeled him a traitor, others have rushed to his side. This week, Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson, an African American historian, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://theundefeated.com/features/the-courage-of-colin-kaepernick/\">called his protest</a> \u201ca thoughtful reflection on how best to highlight the plague of injustice, and the need, finally, to hold our nation accountable for black death in the streets\u201d. Three players, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/colin-kaepernick-eric-reid-kneel-national-anthem-protest-san-francisco-49ers\">49ers team-mate Eric Reid</a>, Denver Bronco Brandon Marshall and Seattle Seahawk Jeremy Lane, have joined Kaeperkick in refusing to stand for the anthem, along with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/04/megan-rapinoe-anthem-protest-colin-kaepernick\">women\u2019s soccer player Megan Rapinoe</a>.</p> <p>In many ways, Kaepernick has chosen the perfect forum for drawing attention to America\u2019s problems with racial inequality. No major American professional league drapes itself in overwrought patriotism more than the NFL, and no other league \u2013 the NBA aside \u2013 is as dominated by African American athletes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/08/olin-kaepernick-roger-goodell-national-anthem-protest-military-racial-oppression\">Goodell missed the point: Kaepernick's argument isn't with the military</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The national anthem is a big event before games, with honor guards and salutes to soldiers. Giant American flags often cover the entire field and military jets buzz the stadium, timing their pass to match the anthem\u2019s final words. In some cities, players clutch American flags as they lead their team-mates to the field. Even in supporting Kaepernick\u2019s right to protest, the other day NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was quick to add: \u201cWe believe very strongly in patriotism in the NFL.\u201d </p> <p>Charged rhetoric has been spilling from the presidential campaign, and the flag is becoming a hammer that some white people have used against African Americans in the US. At last month\u2019s Olympics, black gymnast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/gabby-douglas-hounding-american-champion-olympics\">Gabby Douglas was besieged with criticism</a> for not putting her hand on her heart as the anthem played during a gold medal ceremony. But while Douglas was standing at attention to the flag, unaware that her action could be perceived as a slight, Kaepernick is intentionally sitting to challenge the kind of racism that unfairly judged Douglas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c0b3ef683743b6033999c6ef08244e7c6f20c9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c0b3ef683743b6033999c6ef08244e7c6f20c9a/0_447_2786_1672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At last month\u2019s Olympics, black gymnast Gabby Douglas was besieged with criticism for not putting her hand on her heart as the anthem played during a gold medal ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gymnast Gabby Douglas was besieged with criticism for not putting her hand on her heart as the anthem played during a gold medal ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kaepernick\u2019s actions have not come in a vacuum. The past two years in the US have seen a surge in protests highlighting racial inequality since the shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown, by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The protests, most notably by the Black Lives Matter movement, have helped push the conversation about race into the national consciousness. </p> <p>\u201cThis is something that has to be said, it has to be brought to the forefront of everybody\u2019s attention, and when that\u2019s done I think people can realize what the situation [is] and then really effect change,\u201d Kaepernick said.</p> <p>Kaepernick was born to a white mother and black father in Milwaukee, and was later adopted by a white family who raised him in suburban Wisconsin and California.</p> <p>He is no longer the prominent player he was when he shot to stardom in 2012. Back then, he led the 49ers to within five yards of winning Super Bowl XLVII, but his play quickly tumbled as teams adjusted to his running and passing style. Last season he lost the starting quarterback job, further distancing him from team-mates to whom he had never seemed very close.</p> <p>He has, however, found a voice as an activist. In the past few months, he has grown out his hair, filled his Twitter feed with poignant comments on social issues, and wears a Malcolm X baseball cap. He is smiling more than he ever did in the past. When he addressed the media a few days after the Green Bay game, he didn\u2019t mumble a few words as he used to in press conferences but instead spoke thoughtfully for 20 minutes. He said he wanted to start a conversation about race. He said he had already done so with his team-mates and wanted people to do the same nationally.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed,\u201d Kaepernick said at the time. \u201cTo me this is something that has to change. When there\u2019s significant change and I feel like that flag represents what it\u2019s supposed to represent: this country is representing people the way it\u2019s supposed to, I\u2019ll stand.\u201d<br></p> <p> In the ensuing days people have tried to determine Kaepernick\u2019s motives. As many players, like the New York Giants\u2019 Justin Pugh, criticize his stand as a slap against the military, some push the story that he has been influenced by his girlfriend Nessa Djab, a radio host who is Muslim, alleging that he too is converting \u2013 a rumor he squashed this week. \u201cI think that comes along with people\u2019s fear of this protest, as well as Islamophobia in this country,\u201d he said before taking a swipe at Donald Trump. \u201cPeople are terrified of them to the point where Trump wants to ban all Muslims from coming here, which is ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Kaepernick has gotten the nation\u2019s attention, the next question is how effective will his protest be? \u201cI think that we are talking about (the anthem) but we aren\u2019t talking about the core issue he is raising. he\u2019s raising issues about racism and history,\u201d says Katheryn Russell-Brown, a law professor at the University of Florida. \u201cWe aren\u2019t comfortable talking about these things across racial lines. People are talking about them but they are doing so with people of their own race.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Ali, who was ostracized from boxing for what would have been his prime years, Kaepernick will be allowed to continue his protest. Neither the 49ers nor the league will punish him. They probably understand that his is not a solitary voice, something Kaepernick alluded to this week when he said other players wanted to join him but are \u201cnervous about the consequences\u201d. The Seahawks, for instance, have discussed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/08/seattle-seahawks-team-national-anthem-protest-colin-kaepernick-sunday-opener\">joining Kaepernick and their team-mate Lane</a> in sitting for the anthem this weekend. <span tabindex=\"-1\">If they do, their act will be obvious to everyone watching, unlike the initial, silent protest that has started a movement. </span></p>",
  "<p><strong>Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy\">Dear Jeremy</a> </strong><strong>advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts?</strong></p> <p>I work in higher education disability and dyslexia support, and the sector is undergoing a huge change because of government policy and cuts. I have been on a zero-hours contract for 10 years. </p> <p>Work has always been insecure and I have done a series of part-time and temporary contracts, plus freelancing, in order to make enough money to live on. I\u2019ve also recently put myself through a distance-learning course and gained a teaching qualification so that I am fully qualified and equipped to seek out work in the sector. </p> <p>I have tried out other kinds of jobs in student support, but this area of work is the one I love. </p> <p>Recently, jobs have come up that are guaranteed, part-time hours contracts, but they are like gold dust. The academic support community is tight-knit and I am good friends with a lot of the people going for the same jobs as myself. We all know each other and the nature of our jobs is supportive and non-competitive, as we are helping students overcome barriers to their learning and assist them in developing the skills they need. </p> <p>I\u2019m finding competing against colleagues and friends very difficult. I didn\u2019t get through the last interview process for one of these posts, which has knocked my belief in my ability, too. I\u2019m having a bit of a crisis of confidence as I want my friends and colleagues to do well, but at the same time I know I need to shine.
