  "<p>When you are seven months pregnant, your husband and you go to a local hardware store. When you return 20 minutes later to the carpark, someone has put a folded piece of paper on your windscreen, held down by the wiper. You think it\u2019s just an advertisement, but when Nick unfolds it to take a look, he grows very agitated. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if anyone else got this on their cars,\u201d he tells you, and returns a few moments later. No one else has anything on their windscreen except you.</p> <p>You take the paper from him. At first it seems like a badly photocopied advertisement: a picture of a black boy and a white girl, both around ten years old, well-dressed, perhaps a promotional shot for an American 80s sitcom. The children are inside a circle, which you think is the frame of the picture, until you realise that the image inside is cut into quarters by a large thin cross. In large capital letters on top of the picture are the words: STOP RACE MIXING. Then you realise \u2013 the kids are targets inside the barrel of a gun. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24462fe29dc56807d131ef4a2ca9005f497fac3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24462fe29dc56807d131ef4a2ca9005f497fac3b/0_578_3648_4646/785.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Pung\" width=\"785\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Writer Alice Pung</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Federica Roselli</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d you say to your husband, \u201cI bet that STOP RACE MIXING person has a whole collection of posters he carries around, so when he sees men holding hands he probably pulls out his STOP GAY MARRIAGE and when he sees redheads eating bagels he takes out the STOP GINGER-JEWS one.\u201d </p> <p>You find the incident harmless enough. Some cowardly moron is probably sitting in their car waiting to see your reaction thinking, ha! that\u2019ll teach those miscegenating fornicators a lesson.</p> <p>When you tell your friends at the university college where you live and work, they are incredulously horrified and outraged. \u201cClearly mentally ill,\u201d they say.

STOP RACE MIXING and you go back a long way. When you are a 16-year old sales assistant at your dad\u2019s electrical appliance store, old ladies come in and say, \u201ccan I have an Australian salesman, thanks.\u201d And you dutifully go and find Joe the Italian or Jim the Macedonian. </p> <p>When you are 10, mum walks you home from school and sees a man mowing the lawn across the road. \u201cGo ask him how much he charges to cut grass,\u201d she tells you. Mum speaks no English and the only literature she reads is the Kmart and BiLo ads that come in your letterbox every Tuesday. You do as she asks. The man, an older man with a face like beef jerky left out of the packet for too long, hollers at you: \u201cI DON\u2019T DO YOUSE!\u201d You report to mum, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t cut grass.\u201d \u201cOf course he does, I\u2019ve seen him doing the other lawns around here. Go back. He can\u2019t hear you through the lawnmower noise.\u201d You go back. He yells at you again. \u201cGIT LOST I DON\u2019T DO YOUSE.\u201d You are mortified and ashamed, and at that moment you hate Beefjerk but also your mum for not getting it, for making you ask. </p> <p>***</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/19/kate-tempest-sydney-writers-festival-poisonous-racism-australia\">Kate Tempest: 'There is a damaging and poisonous racism at root in Australia'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You grow up with grandparents who survived the Chinese famine, uncles who survived the Cultural Revolution, a father who survived the Killing Fields of Cambodia and a mother who lived through the aftermath of the fall of Saigon, and you learn that to survive means to blend in, to try to render yourself invisible to any targets.

Vacant commission houses become a common sight along the streets of Braybrook, like a row of teeth rotting at an alarming rate. Old families move to more rural areas to find new jobs. Because rent is so cheap, new families begin migrating to this working-class neighbourhood that now has no work \u2013 Vietnamese, Tongans, Cambodians, mainland Chinese. But the new migrants are resourceful. They work as seasonal fruit-pickers, or in far-flung suburbs where other factories are running, or sew in their poorly-ventilated garages out the back. They don\u2019t mind spending four hours of their day on a bus. They don\u2019t mind eating instant noodles for two meals out of three each day.

You are still loitering at the store looking at discounted socks when you notice the next man at the counter. Dressed in the dignified two-decades-out-of-season suit of newly arrived migrants, he very politely asks for a bag. He\u2019d bought polyester bedsheets in a slippery, clear plastic package. \u201cNope,\u201d says the woman definitively, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any bags.\u201d What she could have said was, we don\u2019t have any big enough.

  "<p>Late last fall, the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers had seemingly settled on two white men to manage their teams. This wasn\u2019t much a surprise. Despite league rules that demand clubs interview non-white candidates for their manager and general manager jobs, baseball teams almost never hire candidates of color. Owners and executives tend to hire people like themselves, and since most of the decision-makers are white, the people they put in charge of their teams are, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/06/blue-jays-romp-texas-jose-bautista\">No bat flip this time from Jose Bautista as Blue Jays romp to 10-1 win over Texas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Washington offered their manager\u2019s job to former Padres manager Bud Black, who accepted it and immediately began negotiating a contract. Los Angeles went into their search with an apparent favoritism for Gabe Kapler, who had once played for team president Andrew Friedman in Tampa Bay. Each was seen as a smart choice; Black the bright tactician who had been in charge of a bad team in San Diego, and Kapler versed in the contemporary ways of baseball thinking.</p> <p>But sometimes, baseball hirings don\u2019t always go the way everyone expects. Black and the Nationals couldn\u2019t agree on a deal, and the Dodgers interviewed a long list of candidates in addition to Kapler, and found they liked someone more than maybe they expected. When the Nats backed away from Black, they hired Dusty Baker. After the Dodgers ended their search, they came out with Dave Roberts. In a game where recent hiring patterns say teams are only trusting white managers to handle their players, the Nationals and Dodgers eventually picked African Americans. By season\u2019s end, they were the only two non-white managers in the big leagues. Their teams also had two of the six-best records in baseball.</p> <p>The National League Division series between the Dodgers and Nats that starts Friday night features several appealing matchups: top starters Clayton Kershaw and Max Scherzer, excellent rookies Corey Seager and Trea Turner and the oversized personalities of Yasiel Puig and Bryce Harper. But, more importantly, for baseball, this will be the first time two black managers have opposed each other in a postseason series. And maybe that\u2019s what the rest of the big league owners should be watching.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, hopefully it motivates other organizations to get some African-American managers, also to motivate other players that are playing now and former players that have managerial aspirations,\u201d Baker said on Thursday at a press conference before the series. \u201cIt probably brings a lot of pride across America and not only African-American people but everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Baseball teams have never been good at employing minority managers or executives. But in an era of advanced metrics, where increasingly the front offices are filled with the graduates of elite colleges who favor analytical analysis in judging players, the opportunities for non-white candidates have become smaller. The new general managers are young, white, and are often hiring baseball versions of themselves. They interview African-American and Latino coaches but rarely hire them. Last year, there was one black manager in baseball, Seattle\u2019s Lloyd McClendon. He was fired after just two years \u2013 and with a winning record \u2013 when the Mariners new analytics-based executive team took over and replaced him with Scott Servais, a former major league catcher whose approach mirrored management\u2019s.</p> <p>The implication is that African Americans and Latinos don\u2019t share the same zeal for numerical analysis as recently-retired white players. Several former managers are often whispered as examples. Frank Robinson, for instance. The Nationals first manager in Washington once glared with disgust when someone explained to him the concept of the now-ubiquitous statistic Wins Against Replacement which measure\u2019s how many victories a player provides over a fictional replacement-level player. \u201cWhat kind of horseshit statistic is that!\u201d Robinson thundered.</p> <p>And while Robinson did things that were out of the norm for a modern manager including <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/25/AR2005072501568.html?nav=rss_sports/nationals\">letting his first base coach fill out the daily lineup card in exchange for a smoothie,</a> he did have a mediocre Nats team in first place for much of his first season in Washington. He might not have liked to study on base percentages but he understood baseball players and how to relate to them. Baker, who has handled everyone from Barry Bonds to Harper, has always had the same ability to motivate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfd8923499d486727588efbc96d208ffdc952378\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfd8923499d486727588efbc96d208ffdc952378/0_36_5239_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dusty Baker leads his team in a moment of silence for Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dusty Baker leads his team in a moment of silence for Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today\u2019s players and coaches all embrace some level of technology. And Roberts, who was Black\u2019s bench coach in San Diego, is a perfect example of how ridiculous the assumption is that non-white coaches aren\u2019t interested in analytics. He brilliantly manipulated match-ups, coaxing 91 wins out of a team that lost Kershaw for two months, had only one starting pitcher stay healthy the whole year and lost most of his right-handed bench players to injury. He is a favorite to win manager of the year in the National League, not only for his maneuvering around statistics but for handling daily calamity as if such thing is normal.</p> <p>Baseball is a diverse game. In nearly every clubhouse, three languages are spoken. When owners and general managers hire men who look and think like themselves, they put their teams in the hands of men who might not relate to the life experiences of their African American and Latino players. These are managers who have never endured racist taunts or spent their first year in the minor leagues alone because they knew no English. Diversity in the manager\u2019s office is a good thing. More teams need to understand this.</p> <p>Like Roberts, Baker had his own disasters to handle. The Nats lost their second-best pitcher Steven Strasburg in August, had off-years from Harper and Ryan Zimmerman and dealt with a three-month bullpen fiasco. Still they won 95 games. Yes, both teams have talent, both were expected to be playoff teams before the season started but they needed managers who could handle regular adversity to get them to this division series. Managing isn\u2019t just about finding favorable matchups it\u2019s about leading. Too often general managers look for clones of themselves instead of true leaders. More than anything, Baker and Roberts were leaders this season.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important, and it doesn\u2019t go unnoticed or under-appreciated,\u201d Roberts said Thursday, about him and Baker being the first black managers to face each other in a series.</p> <p>The game\u2019s only two African American managers are seven wins away from the World Series. The rest of baseball has no choice but to pay attention. </p>",

With 6x9, we wanted to allow our audience to feel what it is like to be in solitary confinement, but we also wanted to effect change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"566ebdafbefd5b311edf4f156faedfabf90774ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/566ebdafbefd5b311edf4f156faedfabf90774ae/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The South By South Lawn logo SXSL at the White House in Washington DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The South By South Lawn logo SXSL at the White House in Washington DC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI/Barcroft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Obama, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vj44/status/783073480786874368\">watched</a> the piece, she called it \u201cprofoundly disturbing\u201d and said 6x9 was an example of what Obama and his White House team had been hoping to achieve. </p> <p>\u201cWe are seeking to encourage technology that leads to informed change,\u201d she said. \u201cTechnology is a powerful tool that can be used as a force for good.\u201d The idea that our pieces can have such impact is what is exciting for me as a journalist.</p> <p>6x9 was an experiment in what virtual reality could mean for the Guardian, and we considered it a success. It showed just how powerful it can be to feel as though you are inside a story. Virtual reality can make you feel that you are in someone else\u2019s shoes \u2013 a significant development for journalism, which tends to report from the third person. As a result, we have just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/2016/oct/04/the-guardian-announces-virtual-reality-project-team\">launched</a> a VR studio at the Guardian. As executive editor of VR, I\u2019m leading a dedicated team. We\u2019ll be producing regular content for you to watch online, on smartphones, and also on the new headsets that are becoming increasingly mainstream gadgets. </p> <p>The practicalities of leading a VR studio are complex. Virtual reality as a form is not yet set in stone: the language and tools for making these pieces isn\u2019t yet established. What VR journalism looks like right now varies hugely \u2013 the work of <a href=\"http://www.immersivejournalism.com/\">Nonny de la Pe\u00f1a</a>, a pioneer in the form, tends to reconstruct real events, using original audio recordings and layering them with animations, for instance, while the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/marketing/nytvr/\">New York Times</a> takes a more documentary-like approach.</p> <p>We have a clear idea what the Guardian VR\u2019s output might look like. Before we embark on making a piece we examine the subject thoroughly: could we make this project as a traditional film? Why are you there? Who are you when you\u2019re watching the VR piece? Can you do anything inside it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b5d8990c779c06dfb7eae7abc4cc171846f7b5fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5d8990c779c06dfb7eae7abc4cc171846f7b5fb/880_243_2620_1572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South by South Lawn attendees at the White House in Washington DC take part in a virtual reality exhibit last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South by South Lawn attendees at the White House in Washington DC take part in a virtual reality exhibit last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea of place is obviously of paramount importance in VR work, but just having an exotic location isn\u2019t enough. We have to ask ourselves whether a feeling of physical presence is essential to the story. In the case of 6x9, it was obvious that form and story matched perfectly: it\u2019s a piece all about place and your relationship to it. </p> <p>But that didn\u2019t mean that it was entirely straightforward to make. We made the piece in CGI (computer generated interface) \u2013 mostly used to make video games \u2013 which was a completely new experience for the Guardian. \u2018Modelling\u2019 the cell and working through the progression of the piece took time and relied on trial and error. We wanted to give a sense of time passing without people tearing off the headsets with boredom.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Virtual reality can make you feel that you are in \u200b\u200bsomeone else\u2019s shoes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Then there are the unexpected challenges. One of these was how much viewers can absorb from these projects \u2013 it turned out that viewers retain far less factual information than we had expected. But, perhaps, that\u2019s not the primary aim with 6x9. Maybe, it\u2019s more about the experience \u2026 and that will stick with you longer.</p> <p>I\u2019ve worked at the Guardian for 10 years, mainly in the area of innovation and journalism, and this is the most exciting development I\u2019ve seen. The potential for VR is huge. I\u2019ve watched people come out of 6x9 in tears and say it has totally changed the way they think about confinement as a punitive tool. It\u2019s been used by mitigation specialists, who work with defence lawyers in capital cases, and by campaigners. So, while the goggles might still be a bit clunky, I\u2019m confident in virtual reality\u2019s future \u2013 and I believe that, once you\u2019ve seen a piece, you will be too. </p> <p><em>Francesca Panetta is the Guardian\u2019s executive editor for virtual reality</em><br></p>",

We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts?</strong></p> <p>I graduated from university in July with a degree in accounting and financial management. As part of my degree I completed a 12-month placement in the finance department of a manufacturing company. I have been applying for graduate and entry-level finance roles for the past three months and I have not been shortlisted for a single interview. </p> <p>Recently, I signed up with a recruiter who has organised interviews with potential employers, but I have not been offered a position. I have got a retail job to keep me going. </p> <p>Searching for finance jobs is harder than I thought. All my peers with similar qualifications are either in entry or graduate roles. </p> <p>I get rejection emails stating they are looking for candidates with relevant skills and experience. I ask for feedback but I get no replies. I tried calling the companies to ask for feedback. Most say they have a \u201cno names policy\u201d, which I find frustrating. </p> <p>You and some readers may suggest I should apply to the company where I completed my placement but I don\u2019t want to work in the manufacturing industry, mainly because of economic uncertainty caused by the EU referendum.</p> <p>I still want a job in accounting and finance, but I am starting to feel inadequate, possibly looking to do a master\u2019s. I don\u2019t know what kind of employers are willing to hire an accounting graduate.</p> <p>What advice can you give to a young graduate like me who is looking for a job in their field? </p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?
