  "<p>A black female doctor has accused Delta Airlines of \u201cblatant discrimination\u201d after a flight attendant allegedly refused to believe that she was a physician and blocked her from helping a sick passenger.</p> <p>Tamika Cross, a resident OB-GYN physician at the University of Texas-Houston, wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tamika.cross.52/posts/658443077654049?pnref=story\">viral Facebook post</a> that on a recent flight from Detroit to Minneapolis, she tried to help an unresponsive man, but a flight attendant repeatedly blocked her and questioned her credentials.</p> <p>Cross wrote that even after officials on the flight requested help from physicians on board, a flight attendant allegedly told her: \u201coh no sweetie put ur hand down, we are looking for actual physicians or nurses or some type of medical personnel, we don\u2019t have time to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>When a white man approached and said he was a physician, the flight attendant allegedly told Cross, \u201cThanks for your help but he can help us.\u201d</p> <p>Delta spokeswoman Catherine Sirna told the Guardian in a statement: \u201cDiscrimination of any kind is never acceptable.

What type of Doctor are you? Where do you work? Why were you in Detroit? (Please remember this man is still in need of help and she is blocking my row from even standing up while Bombarding me with questions).\u201d</p> <p>Cross said she explained that she was in Detroit for a wedding, adding \u201cbut believe it or not they DO HAVE doctors in Detroit\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Facebook\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftamika.cross.52%2Fposts%2F658443077654049&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>After the ordeal was over, the flight attendant \u201ccame and apologized to me several times and offering me skymiles\u201d, Cross wrote. \u201cI kindly refused.

  "<p>\u2018Black film properties may be to the 90s what the carphone was to the 80s; every studio executive has to have one,\u201d wrote the New York Times magazine in the summer of 1991. It\u2019s a comment that speaks volumes about both a cultural moment and its transience. The piece was titled They\u2019ve Gotta Have Us, referring to Spike Lee\u2019s 1986 breakthrough movie She\u2019s Gotta Have It. The group portrait on the cover brought together an impressive collection of young, black film-makers \u2013 what has been labelled \u201cthe class of 91\u201d. Lee was head boy, of course. By that time he was well into a creative blaze that would continue at the rate of practically a film a year: Do the Right Thing (1989), Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990), Jungle Fever (1991), Malcolm X (1992), Crooklyn (1994), Clockers (1995).</p> <p>There was also Lee\u2019s friend Ernest Dickerson, the cinematographer who made Do the Right Thing sizzle, and who was now directing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/hip-hop-cinema-dickerson-juice\">his own Harlem hood tale, Juice</a>. There was Mario Van Peebles, maker of first-rate gangster thriller New Jack City. There were the Hudlin brothers, Warrington and Reginald, makers of hit teen comedy House Party. There were Charles Lane and 20-year-old Matty Rich, whose debut movies had won prizes at Cannes and Sundance, respectively.</p> <p>And the breakout star of the moment was John Singleton, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/13/john-singleton-filmmaker-boyz-n-the-hood-special-screening-academy\">autobiographical Los Angeles drama Boyz N the Hood</a> had earned him a three-year studio deal, and would make him the first African-American, and the youngest-ever best director Oscar nominee. \u201cThe current crop is breaking new ground in their subject matter and their politics,\u201d the article observed. \u201cFor the studios, these are tales from a new world, presented with an often harrowing, if occasionally hyperbolic, realism.\u201d The film-makers themselves seemed sensibly cautious of being lumped into a moment. \u201cIf one black film-maker messes up,\u201d said Lee, \u201cthe rest of us will be made to feel it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/13/john-singleton-filmmaker-boyz-n-the-hood-special-screening-academy\">John Singleton reflects on Boyz N the Hood: 'I didn't know anything'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The caution was justified. Fast forward 25 years or so, and we\u2019re faced with a situation where, for the second year running, not a single actor of colour received an Oscar nomination; where African-Americans are still complaining of under-representation within film and television \u2013 when they\u2019re not taking to the streets to remind the country that their lives matter. Did someone mess up?</p> <p>One thing is for sure: looking back, the 90s was a golden age. The amount of black cinema breaking through at that time is astonishing. Hip-hop, and white audiences\u2019 interest in it, fed into the movement. Rappers and musicians seamlessly transitioned into film: Ice Cube, Ice-T, Tupac Shakur, Queen Latifah. It wasn\u2019t just youthful \u201chood dramas\u201d, however; there was quality work across the spectrum. Serious thrillers such as Devil in a Blue Dress and Deep Cover, appeared alongside arthouse-friendly fare from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Rebellion\">\u201cLA Rebellion\u201d group</a>. This film-schooled movement generated influential works such as Charles Burnett\u2019s To Sleep With Anger and Julie Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust, released in 1991, the first feature directed by an African-American woman to get theatrical distribution across the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1269fb1c77f71aba83c69c78efe180431b766e22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1269fb1c77f71aba83c69c78efe180431b766e22/0_0_2742_1813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ice Cube in Boyz N the Hood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ice Cube in Boyz N the Hood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Columbia/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On television, too, African-American content seemed to be crossing over. Will Smith figuratively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/17/the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-when-the-mainstream-met-afrocentric-style\">sauntered into Hollywood in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</a>, while Jamie Foxx cut his teeth on the Wayans brothers\u2019 sketch show, In Living Color. If you bothered to flick over from Friends or Seinfeld, you could find black-led series such as Moesha, A Different World, Family Matters, Kenan and Kel, Martin (as in Lawrence), Queen Latifah\u2019s Living Single, Sister Sister and Malcolm &amp; Eddie.</p> <p>For the first time, mainstream cinema and TV audiences were getting honest, intelligent portrayals of both modern African-American life and US history from a black perspective \u2013 the type of stories only black film-makers could tell. The revolution was being televised, dramatised, publicised and eulogised.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that it was only three years earlier, in 1987, that Robert Townsend had made the cult satire <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Shuffle\">Hollywood Shuffle</a>, which detailed the futile struggle of an aspiring black actor, and feels as if it is from a completely different era. \u201cThe only role they gonna let us do is a slave, a butler or some street hood,\u201d a fellow auditionee tells Townsend\u2019s character. White producers say they\u2019re looking for an \u201cEddie Murphy type\u201d, and ask him to \u201cbe more black\u201d. In his daydreams, Townsend fantasises about playing a film-noir sleuth, a Shakespearean king, a superhero, even a black Rambo. Instead, he wins the role of a stereotypical, jive-talking street hood, which only conjures visions of protesters picketing his house, accusing him of selling out. As an NAACP spokesman puts it: \u201cThey\u2019ll never play the Rambos until they stop playing the sambos.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb002bc31e483da3c3d07c76ab3dbec175ecbae6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb002bc31e483da3c3d07c76ab3dbec175ecbae6/0_0_4000_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Woodward and Robert Townsend in Hollywood Shuffle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Woodward and Robert Townsend in Hollywood Shuffle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by the mid-90s, Townsend\u2019s wildest dreams had become reality. Now, you could be a black Shakespearean (Denzel Washington in <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1045992-much_ado_about_nothing/\">Much Ado About Nothing</a>), or a black superhero (Wesley Snipes in Blade), or, if not quite Rambo, at least a black action hero (Will Smith in Bad Boys).</p> <p>The fruit of that 90s creative flowering was a generation of African-American performers who gained real Hollywood power: the power to take leading roles, to win awards and, ultimately, to get movies greenlit. Most of them were men, which tells its own story, and most of them still wield that power today: Washington, Smith, Foxx, Samuel L Jackson. But it was also the era when Angela Bassett became the first black women in more than a decade to get a best actress Oscar nomination (for the Tina Turner biopic What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It?) and Whitney Houston powered hits such as The Bodyguard and (alongside Bassett) Waiting to Exhale.</p> <p>But did that success come at a cost? The actors were getting the roles, but their movies weren\u2019t necessarily \u201cblack\u201d stories. More often than not, they became token black faces in otherwise business-as-usual Hollywood movies \u2013 exceptions that proved the rule, you could say. One moment Will Smith might be Muhammad Ali, for example, but the next he would be \u201cmagical negro\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/feb/23/culture.peterbradshaw\">golf caddy Bagger Vance</a>. Meanwhile, the film-makers that had helped put them there seemed to get left behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaaebe1b69df0583e55d670a47834bcc61b3abbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaaebe1b69df0583e55d670a47834bcc61b3abbf/0_0_2464_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy Camilla Johns and Spike Lee in She\u2019s Gotta Have It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tracy Camilla Johns and Spike Lee in She\u2019s Gotta Have It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Island/Everett/REX/Shutterstock/Island/Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s easy to forget just what a struggle they had had. Townsend had to max out credit cards and scavenge leftover film stock to cobble together Hollywood Shuffle. It took Lee four years to raise $175,000 to make She\u2019s Gotta Have It, in a brisk 12 days. Lee even encouraged his crew to save their drinks cans so he could cash them in for recycling. One upshot of these shoestring budgets was that these films became hugely profitable when they broke through. It was arguably that profitability, rather than any cultural mission, that caught Hollywood\u2019s attention.</p> <p>A big part of the problem, says Julie Dash, was that black cinema\u2019s ascent coincided with Hollywood\u2019s takeover of independent cinema as a whole. \u201cIt became a commodity that could be co-opted by the larger industry. We broke through, and once the curators of culture recognised that we were actively making films in our own way, it suddenly just slowed down to a halt. Funding ran out for pretty much everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust was one of the unsung highlights of this era. It deals with Dash\u2019s own <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullah\">Gullah community</a>, descended from slaves who settled on the coast of North Carolina, but it does so with a unique sensibility, weaving together three generations of female characters with music, dance, folk storytelling and lyrical imagery. She describes it as \u201chistory reframed, reimagined, redefined\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b65708eab90e24176444c5cc4501ed965d366d8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b65708eab90e24176444c5cc4501ed965d366d8c/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daughters of the Dust.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daughters of the Dust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: null/BFI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The movie won widespread acclaim on its release, and played in one movie theatre for 36 weeks, but Dash never made another feature film. \u201cI\u2019d written many, many additional screenplays and pitched ideas and optioned screenplays \u2013 all of those wonderful things that one does after making a film that clearly had a wide audience. It didn\u2019t happen for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason given, but of course it\u2019s race and gender. Gender plays a huge part in all of this. I did not fit into the mould.\u201d</p> <p>As the New Yorker pointed out last year, Richard Linklater, who also released his debut, Slacker, in 1991, has gone on to make 15 features to date. \u201cSome of them are excellent,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-week-daughters-dust\">wrote Richard Brody</a>, \u201cbut neither Slacker nor any of the others can hold a candle to the inventiveness of Daughters of the Dust.\u201d</p> <p>Many other black film-makers fell by the wayside after that initial burst. Wendell Harris\u2019s Sundance-winning Chameleon Street didn\u2019t get a cinema release. Matty Rich made one more movie after Straight Outta Brooklyn, then went into video games. Even those who did graduate into the mainstream found their work compromised. Charles Burnett, for example, followed up To Sleep With Anger with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Shield\">The Glass Shield</a>, a complex drama about a black cop in an institutionally racist LAPD. It was picked up by Harvey Weinstein\u2019s indie-devouring Miramax, which forced Burnett to change the ending and then attempted to market it as another Boyz N the Hood, giving prominence to Ice Cube in the promotional materials even though he was a peripheral character. It didn\u2019t find an audience, and Burnett never worked with Hollywood again.</p> <p>\u201cThat crossover into the mainstream, into an industry of big business and box office and expectations and formulas, reduced their ability to tell black-focused, \u2018authentic\u2019 stories,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/people/ashley-clark\">Ashley Clark</a>, writer and curator of the <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/black-star\">BFI\u2019s current Black Star celebration of black cinema in all its forms</a>, which includes many of those 90s classics. (It was a different story in the UK in the 1990s, incidentally. Or rather, a non-story. Just about the only British actor to figure in this era was, believe it or not, Lenny Henry. Disney gave him a three-picture deal in 1991, evidently attempting to position him as a new Eddie Murphy. They paired him with Charles Lane for True Identity, in which Henry played several roles including a white gangster. Its failure nipped both Henry\u2019s and Lane\u2019s Hollywood careers in the bud.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736/0_0_2000_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delroy Lindo and Denzel Washington in Malcolm X.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delroy Lindo and Denzel Washington in Malcolm X.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Directors such as Singleton, Dickerson and Van Peebles also struggled to recapture the energy once they became Hollywood properties. Lee\u2019s career assumed the form of a continual battle. Clark points out that he had a terrible time making Malcolm X, for example. \u201cHe had to fight off competition from other studios to do it. Norman Jewison wanted to do it. His studio, Warner Bros, wouldn\u2019t expand the budget, so he had to do a crowdfunding campaign and get people like Prince, Michael Jackson and Oprah Winfrey to fund it.\u201d By the end of the decade, Lee\u2019s crossover audience had waned, even if the quality of his output hadn\u2019t. Films such as Crooklyn and Bamboozled flopped at the box office, and he wound up making journeyman genre fare such as 25th Hour.</p> <p>But what other options did Lee and co have? \u201cWhat people don\u2019t realise is, he gets tarred and feathered as this angry, political black man, but he\u2019s an artist, and he\u2019s constantly working,\u201d says Clark. \u201cHe works in documentary, he works in commercials, he never stops. And he has to do that. He can\u2019t, like other directors, just go away for eight years and come back and do something when he feels like it.\u201d</p> <p>By the new millennium, we had collectively fooled ourselves that we no longer needed a black cinema anyway. Washington and Halle Berry had won their Oscars, and nobody seemed to be that bothered that the new face of black cinema was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madea\">Tyler Perry dressed as a granny</a>. Actually, a lot of people were bothered by Perry \u2013 Lee dismissed him as \u201ccoonery buffoonery\u201d \u2013 but the assumption, particularly outside the African-American community, was that the battles had all been won. The notion was continually reinforced by self-congratulatory <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film\">white-saviour race movies</a> such as The Help, Freedom Writers, The Soloist and The Blind Side (it\u2019s still going on \u2013 see Matthew McConaughey\u2019s latest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/23/free-state-jones-review-matthew-mcconaughey-newton-knight\">The Free State of Jones</a>), or music biopics such as Ray, Dreamgirls and Get On Up, whose content was safely sealed off from the present-day black experience. Ghettoised, you could say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8bbb4e09789664d4917c6494b0c18ab61ffecd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8bbb4e09789664d4917c6494b0c18ab61ffecd1/0_0_2992_2354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan in Creed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan in Creed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>America\u2019s Obama-era post-racial vision has turned out to be an illusion. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/25/oscarssowhite-10-point-plan-hashtag-academy-awards-april-reign\">#OscarSoWhite debacle</a> highlighted ongoing discrimination and lack of opportunity within the industry. Outside of cinema, society is beginning to notice how little has changed. Boyz N the Hood began with an epigraph stating: \u201cOne out of every 21 black American males will be murdered in their lifetime.\u201d The figure is lower today, but black Americans are still eight times as likely as white ones to be homicide victims. Lee\u2019s Malcolm X began with a videotape of the brutal police beating of Rodney King, which sparked off the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen a similar succession of police killings of unarmed African-Americans, captured on mobile phones, which have also sparked riots and civil unrest.</p> <p>A new generation of black film-makers is starting to respond to this reality, down the road those 90s pioneers paved. Witness Ryan Coogler, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/05/fruitvale-station-review-oscar-grant\">2013 Sundance-winner, Fruitvale Station</a>, sensitively dramatised the police shooting of Oscar Grant, an unarmed Oakland commuter. To his credit, Sylvester Stallone recruited Coogler to write and direct <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/creed-review-rocky-sequel-boxing-sylvester-stallone\">his latter-day Rocky vehicle Creed</a>, and allowed him to turn what could have been a creaky franchise instalment into a vibrant, nuanced portrait of an unstereotypical African-American (Michael B Jordan) in demographically altered modern-day Philadelphia. Coogler\u2019s next project is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/oct/29/marvel-black-panther-black-superhero-chadwick-boseman\">Marvel\u2019s Black Panther superhero movie</a>.</p> <p>Slavery has been put back on the agenda by 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained, and it\u2019s being kept there by the Roots remake and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/oct/10/the-birth-of-a-nation-problems-nate-parker\">Nate Parker\u2019s Birth of a Nation</a> (the toast of this year\u2019s Sundance, until its maker\u2019s name was tarnished by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/nate-parker-birth-of-a-nation-rape-allegation-60-minutes-interview\">past rape allegations</a>). Justin Simien\u2019s Dear White People <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/25/justin-simien-im-black-im-a-man-im-gay-but-im-more-than-all-of-those-things\">smartly dissected modern campus politics</a>. Big things are anticipated for Barry Jenkins, whose artful gay black drama Moonlight comes out in the US this month. There\u2019s also (at last) an appreciable British black-cinema contingent feeding into this, both of directors (Steve McQueen, Amma Asante, Noel Clarke) and actors (David Oyelowo, Idris Elba, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Naomie Harris). Television is in good shape now, too, what with Donald Glover\u2019s Atlanta, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/12/insecure-review-issa-rae\">Issa Rae\u2019s Insecure</a>, Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage, Empire, Black-ish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3844fd6bf591a9442cbf8b8c22a2dc3ba27b91f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3844fd6bf591a9442cbf8b8c22a2dc3ba27b91f6/61_0_2834_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Straight Outta Compton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Straight Outta Compton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaimie Trueblood/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And a force all of her own is Ava DuVernay, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/selma\">Selma</a> arguably made more of an impact for not getting enough Oscar respect than it would have done if it had. DuVernay has since turned out the powerful Netflix documentary 13th (on the incarceration of black men), the TV miniseries Queen Sugar, and her next project, Disney sci-fi A Wrinkle in Time, makes her the first black woman to command a $100m (\u00a381m) budget.</p> <p>We should be cautious before heralding a class of 2016, however, both in light of what happened last time round, but also because black cinema is a construct, just as \u201cblackness\u201d itself is a construct. The label can be limiting, says Clark. \u201cWhen a black film-maker makes films about black people, it\u2019s \u2018black cinema\u2019 rather than just cinema. You find yourself in that kind of bind, where today something like Moonlight \u2013 yes, it\u2019s being talked about in terms of black masculinity and it\u2019s very culturally specific, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s wonderful cinema. I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding that black cinema is in and of itself a genre, when in fact it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>The 90s golden age has become a cultural touchstone for the current generation. Ice Cube, for example, who has never been out of work since Boyz N the Hood, found his own life dramatised in last year\u2019s hit NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton. Cube\u2019s Boyz co-star Cuba Gooding Jr, meanwhile, just headed up another 90s-based nostalgia trip: The People Vs OJ Simpson, which won nine Emmys this year. John Singleton has just received the go-ahead for <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/john-singletons-snowfall-series-fx-1201874205/\">Snowfall, his new series on LA\u2019s 1980s crack cocaine epidemic</a> \u2013 almost a prequel to Boyz. And even Spike Lee seems to have got his mojo back. His latest, Chi-Raq, a confrontational take on south Chicago gun violence, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/25/chi-raq-review-spike-lees-urgent-angry-and-very-sexy-midlife-masterpiece\">brought him his best reviews in decades</a>, as well as reuniting him with original troupe members such as Angela Bassett, Wesley Snipes and Samuel L Jackson. Of course, he still struggled with the funding \u2013 turning to Kickstarter to finance it. But Lee also recently inked a deal with Netflix to produce and direct a comedy-drama series based on She\u2019s Gotta Have It.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e18349b881f0ee5e695284e7c27acc6457ac5d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e18349b881f0ee5e695284e7c27acc6457ac5d3/0_0_1280_722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018visual album\u2019 Lemonade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018visual album\u2019 Lemonade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beyonce: Lemonade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most heartening of all, perhaps, Julie Dash\u2019s Daughters of the Dust has found a new lease of life. It was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress in 2004, and a restored version is set for release in November, to mark its 25th anniversary. The film was also heavily appropriated by Beyonc\u00e9 in her lavish \u201cvisual album\u201d for Lemonade \u2013 which could turn out to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/beyonce-lemonade-jay-z-infidelity-emotional-project-depths\">one of the most significant pieces of black cinema of our time</a>. It\u2019s apt that a performer such as Beyonc\u00e9, in her newly politicised incarnation, would turn to a movie so concerned with cultural memory and reconnection to African-American history. That history has been reframed, redefined and reimagined once again. Dash herself is delighted. In addition, in the wake of the #OscarSoWhite debacle, Dash was one of the film-makers invited to join the new, more-inclusive Academy. Her original application, 25 years ago, was ignored. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are still a lot of people waiting at the gate, but things are moving forward.\u201d</p> <p><em>Black Star events are running nationwide until December, </em><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/black-star\"><em>bfi.org.uk/black-star</em></a><em>.</em></p>",
