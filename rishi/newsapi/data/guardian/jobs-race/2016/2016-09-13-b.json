[
  "<p>In the summer of 2015, during last year\u2019s Burning Man, festival founder Larry Harvey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/04/burning-man-founder-larry-harvey-race-diversity-silicon-valley\">told me</a> that \u201cblack folks don\u2019t like to camp as much as white folks\u201d. That week, I interviewed about 30 black people and some other people of color at Burning Man (pretty much all the people of color I could find who would talk to me) about why they came to a festival that was so overwhelmingly white. According to the Black Rock City census, black people at Burning Man make up only <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/27/black-campers-burning-man-explain-why\">about 1%</a> of attendees.</p> <p>When I returned this year, there was a burning question on many people\u2019s minds: did I think there were more black people at Burning Man a year later?</p> <p>In a word: yes.</p> <p>But to qualify that: there still weren\u2019t nearly enough, and whiteness ran rampant. It\u2019s funny. When I asked Harvey about the lack of diversity last year, he bluntly said \u201cwe\u2019re not going to set racial quotas\u201d \u2013 and as an organization, Burning Man seems to be doing little creatively and systematically to address the lack of diversity. The funny thing is that you can see people go to the ends of the earth to address the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/\">Burning Man principle</a> of \u201cradical self-expression\u201d, while doing almost nothing to address its principle of \u201cradical inclusion\u201d. </p> <p>People say \u201cwell anyone can go to Burning Man\u201d, and anyone can try to buy tickets through the lottery. But it\u2019s really expensive, which segregates in one way, especially for people who haven\u2019t invested in all the camping infrastructure. </p> <p>Also, Burning Man distributes tickets to theme camps outside of the lottery to give preference to groups with a history with the festival. This is understandable. But those camps are almost all overwhelmingly white. So except for a handful of camps, Burning Man invests in the presence of hundreds of majority white theme camps, who will distribute their tickets almost exclusively to white people. And unless Burning Man consciously interrupts this, the population will just repeat itself \u2013 like any other ongoing segregated population. It would take a sense of radical, not passive, inclusion. </p> <p>My observations are anecdotal but not uncritical. In 2015, I was constantly looking out for black people, and kept seeing the same folks over and over again. This year, I saw new black faces all week. Sometimes when I\u2019d talk to black Burners, I\u2019d hear it was their first time, and they\u2019d tell me they\u2019d come because of our article. Also, several longtime black burners told me about their joy at seeing more black folks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Steven Thrasher\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKLZ1KZhtH4/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Silky, Uncle Vern &amp;amp; I put our foot up in it cooking ribs for 35 in just 2 hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Steven Thrasher (@thrasherxy) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-10T14:07:33+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 10, 2016 at 7:07am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>At the same time, the camp I stayed in (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/sep/05/burning-man-temple-project-death-mourning\">Que Viva</a>) was a racial and social justice camp, set up right next to the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/People-Of-Color-at-Burning-Man-586227634754548/\">People of Color Camp</a>. And people would come home to our camps after a day of exploring and say things like, \u201cIt\u2019s so white out there.\u201d And it was! The whiteness could be exhausting \u2013 like when a white guy wandered in to look at our Black Lives Matter altar, only to lecture me about the black people in our camp likely not being authentic enough for his tastes. </p> <p>True, sometimes you\u2019d hear drums or see feathers, and when you\u2019d get closer, you\u2019d see they were <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ohtonyedwards/photos/a.10154616091769430.1073741985.8841939429/10154616102454430/?type=3&amp;theater\">being utilized by people of color</a> to reflect their cultures in beautiful ways. But more often, it would be clueless white people <a href=\"http://journal.burningman.org/2016/08/opinion/serious-stuff/native-costumes-social-justice-activism/\">dancing around in headdresses</a> or appropriating cultures in other tacky and offensive manners.</p> <p>But I\u2019m just one person. I decided to ask some other POC burners whether they thought there was more color this year at the blindingly white Burning Man. Here are some of our answers, edited from conversations by phone, email, Facebook message and text.</p> <h2>Vernon Andrews (AKA Uncle Vern)</h2> <p>Though I don\u2019t have census statistics to back me up (yet), my educated guess is the numbers might increase slightly this year for African American attendance at Burning Man. Before I became a member of the <a href=\"http://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/census-data/\">Black Rock Census</a> team two years ago, I\u2019d chase down every black person I saw on Playa for my research. In the past, that was doable. This year I was exhausted even counting visually the black folks I saw. No way I could have kept up my hydration and chased down my potential research subjects. I think numbers have gone up. Nice trend!</p> <h2>Jamila Reddy</h2> <p>I feel like I saw more people of color at Burning Man this year than I have the past three years, but it still doesn\u2019t feel like a space that genuinely champions diversity. Camping with a group of predominantly POC folk made the rest of Burning Man\u2019s overwhelming whiteness even more glaring. That said, Burning Man is an experience that has been really joyful and transformative for me, and I\u2019m excited to see more folks of color sharing in that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Steven on the playa\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BJoVgi7BnJC/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#BlackLivesMatter in Black Rock City #burningman2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Steven Thrasher (@thrasherxy) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-08-27T23:16:21+00:00&quot;&gt;Aug 27, 2016 at 4:16pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Nicholas Powers (aka Honey Shot)</h2> <p>Is it wishful thinking or did I truly see more people of color at Burning Man this year? Bicycling from camp to camp, I said hi, hugged, kissed, gave dap and the ever-useful keep-it-cool head nod to black Burners. It was like a racial relay race in the desert where we could pass glances back and forth, making a network of double consciousness across the city. </p> <p>Our presence was a degree above tokenism but far, far, far below the tipping point that would revitalize Burning Man. It helped that there were two camps dedicated to melanin. Que Viva camp, a powerful social justice camp, and my People of Color camp, where POC came by to enjoy the knowing ways of shared references, winks above smiles, laughter after pulling off the scab of racism, dancing late into the night \u2013 until our skin was black as space, filled with stars.</p> <h2>Lorenzo Herrera y Lozano</h2> <p>I walked away from my first burn in 2014 believing that Burning Man held great potential for people of color to explore, create and play. Three burns later, that belief became a conviction. Yet my experiences are not without context as this was also the first year I camped with Que Viva camp, which neighbored People of Color camp. Both camps, by virtue of their demographic composition and explicit social justice politics, language, and workshop and dialogue spaces, became black and brown oases for people of color and white allies seeking shelter from the heat and the disingenuously color-blind and selectively apolitical culture of white liberalism and libertarianism.</p> <p>Sadly, 2016 was not without white people walking around with native headdresses and dreadlocks, wealthy plug-and-play camps, or the proportionally dismal number of people of color Burning Man is known for. It was, however, where I had the rare opportunity to think, laugh, cry, play and create among people of color and white allies who are about creating a larger antiracist world where more of us can fit, a world that neither begins nor ends in Black Rock City. Thanks to the people and the content of the experiences we co-created, 2016 set a high bar for what a people-of-color and social justice\u2013centered burn can and should look like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Steven and Honey Shot get stuck into some sustenance\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BKOXceVhy7N/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brother Nick and I engage in the ritual sacrifice of a watermelon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Steven Thrasher (@thrasherxy) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-09-11T17:44:25+00:00&quot;&gt;Sep 11, 2016 at 10:44am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Marlon Williams</h2> <p>It definitely felt like there were black people this year. When I saw a person of color, it wasn\u2019t as novel or as freakish as it usually is. I usually do a count of black people. In the past, my count was in the low 70s, and in a high year it was 105. This year, I think being with a pregnant lady, my brain was in baby mode and I didn\u2019t do the count. But I did feel like there were more black folks, and that folks were more comfortable. </p> <p>I was a Black Rock Ranger this year [rangers <a href=\"http://rangers.burningman.org/\">are</a> \u201cparticipants who volunteer a portion of their time at Burning Man in service of the safety and well-being of the Burning Man community,\u201d who often mediate in situations before law enforcement gets involved]. When I went to my ranger training, there was a moment with the woman who managed us. She\u2019s a black woman, and most of the people in training were people of color, and there was this instant camaraderie between us. She said, \u201cWe want you to do great, because we want to have more people who look like us, particularly as we can occupy the space between the Burning Man community and law enforcement.\u201d And I had this idea. In this past year, we\u2019ve seen all these negative interactions between people of color and law enforcement. Of course people of color would flock \u2013 not to a law enforcement place, but to be protectors of a community \u2026 to say to ourselves, \u201cWhat can I do to be someone standing in this space between this community and the outside world?\u201d It was very healing.</p> <ul> <li>It you want to share your story of being a person of color at Burning Man, please email <a href=\"mailto:steven.thrasher@theguardian.com\">steven.thrasher@theguardian.com</a><br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>This isn\u2019t something that can be said very often, but the NCAA actually got something right for a change. On Monday, the oft-maligned governing body for college sports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/ncaa-north-carolina-anti-lgbt-law-hb2-college-sports\">announced</a> that it would be moving seven events, most notably the opening round of the men\u2019s basketball tournament, out of North Carolina due to the passing of House Bill 2 earlier in the year. The NCAA\u2019s decision comes several months after the NBA made the decision to move the all-star game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/21/nba-moves-all-star-game-charlotte-hb2-law\">from Charlotte</a> to New Orleans. </p> <p>The NCAA made it immediately clear that this was not a move they were making without putting much thought into it. In a <a href=\"http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/ncaa-relocate-championships-north-carolina-2016-17\">detailed press release</a>, the NCAA explained their decision to move all seven events scheduled to take place in North Carolina throughout the 2016-17 academic year. Most of their reasons detail the blatantly discriminatory nature of HB2, which makes it illegal for transgender individuals to use restrooms that differ from the sex on their birth certificate, invalidating local laws that would protect LGBT individuals while effectively legalizing governmental discrimination against them. All in all, it mostly reads as the NCAA taking a praiseworthy stance against LGBT discrimination.<br></p> <p>This is certainly how they\u2019re going to frame this decision, making a particular point in relating it back to their nominal role as an educational institution. NCAA president Mark Emmert, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2016/09/13/mark-emmert-ncaa-north-carolina-hb2-house-bill/90295710/?hootPostID=56f7447cebc8f9785bb9c8c4bebf6db2\">speaking with CBS This Morning</a>, said \u201cthis is an issue to an issue that\u2019s fundamental to higher ed ... Fairness and inclusion are at the heart of what the NCAA does and what universities do. For our university presidents, this was a proverbial no-brainer.\u201d</p> <p>That all sounds nice but the NCAA is, 501c3 nonprofit status notwithstanding, a business organization and, from that perspective, there was probably considerable more debate about this decision. First of all, it could end up damaging their relationship with a region that has been practically synonymous with college basketball for decades: no state has hosted <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/sports/ncaa-moves-championship-events-from-north-carolina.html?_r=0\">more tournament games</a> than North Carolina. While both Duke University and the University of North Carolina have <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/duke-unc-ads-state-support-of-ncaa-in-north-carolina-tourney-ban/\">released statements</a> supporting the NCAA\u2019s decision, they run the risk of alienating a significant percentage of customers.</p> <p>It\u2019s bigger than just North Carolina, though. The NCAA\u2019s announcement comes during a heated political climate dominated by discussions of bigotry and discrimination. Unsurprisingly, this decision has been received quite differently by those on opposite ends of the aisle. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s Twitter feed blandly praised the NCAA\u2019s decision:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/775683074747199488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCAA\">@NCAA</a> is right to pull tournament games from North Carolina because of the anti-LGBT HB2 law.

It\u2019s encouraging that this ultimately didn\u2019t dictate their decision.</p> <p>But they didn\u2019t make it in a vacuum. After breaking down the numerous ways HB2 was discriminatory and inconsistent with their stated beliefs, the NCAA acknowledges that there was also a logistical aspect at play. It became increasingly difficult to keep the events where they were because \u201cfive states plus numerous cities prohibit travel to North Carolina for public employees \u2026 which could include student-athletes and campus athletic staff.\u201d In other words, the fact that these states (New York, Minnesota, Washington, Vermont, Connecticut) barred government travel to North Carolina in the wake of HB2\u2019s passing forced their hand somewhat. <br></p> <p>It also probably isn\u2019t a coincidence that they made this decision after the NBA announced that it was moving the 2017 all-star game. It\u2019s impossible to imagine the board agreeing to move multiple championships if the NBA had decided it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to relocate a single event. The NCAA also knew that <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2016/04/13/135391/north-carolinas-discriminatory-h-b-2-threatens-more-than-half-billion-dollars-in-economic-activity/\">other businesses</a> had already decided to stop doing business there.<br></p> <p>Basically, every state government, business or organization that made the decision to stay out of North Carolina as long as this discriminatory law was in effect made it that much easier for the NCAA to take this rather drastic step. The hope now, at least for those who believe that applying economic pressure is the most effective way in getting HB2 rewritten or repealed altogether, is that this latest high-profile boycott will embolden others to join in.<br></p> <p>For that reason, the NCAA should be commended for taking a stance against discrimination here.

But for many more of the delegates from Uefa\u2019s 55 members gathered to elect their next president at the Astir Palace Beach Resort in Athens, the surprise address from Michel Platini will be warmly welcomed.</p> <p>Ever since the three-times world footballer of the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/09/michel-platini-cas-appeal-ban-football\" title=\"\">became embroiled in a Byzantine scandal</a> concerning a \u00a31.35m \u201cdisloyal payment\u201d from the similarly disgraced Fifa president Sepp Blatter, many in Europe have remained loyal to their former leader.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/12/michel-platini-address-uefa-congress-despite-four-year-football-ban-fifa\">Michel Platini to address Uefa congress despite four-year football ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just as the collapse of global football governance does not seem to have dented the desire of its power brokers to meet in luxurious surroundings (the venue for their congress nestles in \u201c75 acres of sun-drenched gardens on a pine-dotted private peninsula\u201d according to its website), so the election to decide Platini\u2019s successor seems to have heralded a return to business as usual.</p> <p>So it is that an election that has boiled down to two candidates \u2013 the little known but hotly tipped Slovenian Aleksander Ceferin and the veteran former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/07/fa-announce-backing-for-michael-van-praag-in-race-to-be-uefa-president\" title=\"\">Dutch FA chief Michael van Praag</a> \u2013 has taken place largely in the shadows.</p> <p>Bizarrely, despite his ban from all football-related activities (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/09/michel-platini-cas-appeal-ban-football\" title=\"\">reduced to four years on appeal</a>), Platini has been given a dispensation on \u201chumanitarian grounds\u201d to address the congress on Wednesday.</p> <p>Given Platini referred to himself in an interview last year as an Icarus-like figure, there is a certain poetic justice in his Greek tragedy coming full circle in Athens. The suspicion of some of those supportive of Van Praag, the capable administrator who failed in a bid to challenge Blatter earlier this year and threw his weight behind the similarly doomed Prince Ali of Jordan, is that the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, may have had some influence in the decision to allow Platini to speak.</p> <p>As outlined in an excellent, lengthy summary on the <a href=\"http://twohundredpercent.net/democracy-uefa-style/\" title=\"\">Two Hundred Percent website</a>, the latter stages of the campaign have been studded by the usual wearying claims of backroom dealing.</p> <p>Ceferin, a 48-year-old lawyer who has been president of the Slovenian FA since 2011, is said to enjoy the backing of Infantino, who until he was unexpectedly pitched into the Fifa race was Uefa\u2019s secretary-general.</p> <p>The Fifa president was alleged by the Dutch newspaper De Volksrant to have sent an adviser to a meeting of northern European FAs to lobby on Ceferin\u2019s behalf before the Champions League final on 28 May. Ceferin had been invited to the meeting to discuss his plans for his prospective candidacy. Before Ceferin had even announced his campaign, the Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish FAs had come out in favour of his candidacy.</p> <p>The adviser sent to the May meeting was the Norwegian FA\u2019s secretary-general Kjetil Siem, who was announced as Infantino\u2019s \u201cdirector of strategic affairs\u201d on 18 May. Fifa said Siem was still working for the Norwegian FA at the time of the meeting.</p> <p>An investigation by the Norwegian football magazine Josimar detailed allegations that Siem worked to gather votes for Ceferin and in return promised seats on Uefa\u2019s board and favourable consideration for tournament bids. Ceferin angrily called the claims \u201calmost completely not true\u201d and said it was \u201ca lie\u201d Siem had pledged Infantino\u2019s support.</p> <p>Ceferin is the favourite, with the confirmed support of at least 17 smaller nations as well as France, Germany and \u2013 perhaps crucially \u2013 Russia. In total, as many as 35 federations are believed to have declared support for Ceferin. Like Blatter, he has pursued a strategy of positioning himself as the man who will stand up for the little guys. In a one-member, one-vote election it is a sensible move. Safe in the knowledge the recent Champions League deal that favoured bigger European clubs in order to head off breakaway threats cannot be unpicked, Ceferin can now afford to say he will stand up for smaller countries in future.</p> <p>\u201cThose changes are clearly not in favour of small and mid-sized associations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process was not good. The clubs didn\u2019t know anything about it and that should be changed in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond the bare bones of his CV, little is known about Ceferin. In many ways he appears similar to Infantino \u2013 a plausible, multi-lingual lawyer with a smooth manner. That is less of a compliment than it once may have appeared in light of Infantino\u2019s increasingly egocentric approach to the huge challenges at Fifa.</p> <p>Those with a glass half-full mentality may harbour hopes a new man atop European football with an avowed mission to level the playing field could be a positive force. Those who have grown cynical watching the machinations at Fifa and Uefa down the years are instead wondering who is really pulling the strings. Even they, however, take some comfort from the fact the veteran Spanish Fifa executive committee member \u00c1ngel Mar\u00eda Villar Llona was forced to withdraw owing to lack of support.</p> <p>It was Villar Llona who was investigated in connection with an alleged vote swapping deal with Qatar during the tainted 2018-22 World Cup bidding process, before trying to shut down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/13/farce-fifa-michael-garcia-erroneous-ethics-report\" title=\"\">Michael Garcia\u2019s investigation</a>. His withdrawal was one final humiliation for the old guard.</p> <p>Yet even as Uefa has remained without a leader in light of Platini\u2019s enforced absence, the machine has rolled on. The expanded Euro 2016 made a huge profit despite concerns over the new format and, following much sabre rattling, that crucial deal over the future of the Champions League has been secured. In other words, behind the politicking the popularity of modern football means the cash continues to roll in as never before.</p> <p>The English FA finds itself in a familiar bind. On the one hand it has thrown its backing behind Van Praag in the knowledge his agenda is closest to its own. On the other, it is loath to create too many waves in the knowledge that thanks to the former Manchester United chief executive David Gill it has more clout in the Fifa and Uefa corridors of power than at any time for the past two decades.</p> <p>\u201cHe is someone we have come to know very well and worked closely with in recent years, particularly because of our shared commitment to securing Fifa reform,\u201d said Gill, the FA\u2019s vice-chairman and Uefa executive committee member, explaining the decision last week. \u201cAs Uefa president, Mr Van Praag would be able to provide the strong and credible leadership European football requires at a crucial moment for the global game.\u201d</p> <p>The Football Association of Ireland has thrown its backing behind Ceferin. \u201cHe has been a very progressive and extremely innovative leader in his native Slovenia and his successful candidacy would be a very positive move for European football and the administration as a whole,\u201d said the chief executive, John Delaney.</p> <p>The manifestos of the candidates, both 17 pages long and crammed full of the sort of motherhood and apple pie sentiments that will be familiar to any student of global sports politics, provide little clue as to how they would approach the role.</p> <p>Even if, as in most recent elections, the FA ends up backing the loser there is confidence its hard-won influence will not be affected. As well as Gill, the FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, and the chairman, Greg Clarke, will also travel to Athens.</p> <p>The first public engagement of the new president will be at a launch in London next week for Platini\u2019s one-off, continent-wide Euro 2020 competition, the semi-finals and final of which will be at Wembley.</p> <p>For those who hoped the lurid collapse of Fifa would herald a new age, the manoeuvrings of recent months have been a depressing reminder that the more things change, the more they appear to stay the same.</p>",
