  "<p>Others might regard his position as unfortunate but David Moyes believes he is a lucky man. Despite presiding over the worst start to a Premier League season, which has involved the collection of two points from 10 games, Sunderland\u2019s manager accepts that, in some ways, he is in an enviable position.</p> <p>\u201cI think the club are aware that they don\u2019t want to get in a situation of tossing and turning and changing managers all the time and that, at the moment, is helping me,\u201d Moyes said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/04/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Accordingly, Sunderland\u2019s seventh manager in five years continues to enjoy the staunch support of Ellis Short, the owner, and Martin Bain, the chief executive as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/04/bournemouth-sunderland-match-preview\" title=\"\">heads to Bournemouth on Saturday seeking that elusive first league win</a>.</p> <p>\u201cStability is needed,\u201d said Sam Allardyce\u2019s successor. \u201cThe club don\u2019t want to change managers again \u2013 and rightly so. Some of my predecessors here deserved to be given longer.\u201d</p> <p>Short has often been prone to knee-jerk reactions but he seems determined to keep faith with his latest coach. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone to Ellis two or three times this week,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cIt was good. But I didn\u2019t expect anything else. I\u2019ve had nothing but support from him and Martin.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, he accepts things could alter should Sunderland keep losing \u2013 and particularly if they fail to beat Hull City at home in their first game after the international break. \u201cI\u2019m not daft, you have to win games,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a big boy and I know it\u2019s my job to get results. My job is to make sure we\u2019re in the Premier League again next season. I\u2019m not stupid \u2013 the fact of the matter is we\u2019re not doing well and it will get to a point where we can\u2019t keep saying what we\u2019re saying.\u201d</p> <p>The Stadium of Light hierarchy are praying it does not come to that. \u201cEllis is saying: \u2018Go on and do the job. We knew it would be a long-term job, keep going,\u2019\u201d said Moyes. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously desperate for the team to win. He wants us to buck up and do better, if we can.\u201d</p> <p>Moyes appreciates the disconnect at the heart of what seems an interminable cycle of disappointment on Wearside. \u201cThis is definitely still a big club,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why so many people want this job. Sunderland\u2019s still got the stature of a big British football club. It\u2019s got a fantastic stadium, it\u2019s got a really good training facility and the supporters have a pride in following their team everywhere even when they\u2019re losing.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, startlingly, Sunderland\u2019s home crowds have averaged almost 42,000 this season, the sixth highest in the Premier League. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a big club and it will always be a big club,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cSunderland\u2019s size and history are not in doubt but it\u2019s the supporters who are making this club great at the moment \u2013 they\u2019re the ones keeping us going. The supporters are the only plus point. The team and the manager are not performing but the supporters are.\u201d</p> <p>It seems the January transfer window could prove pivotal but Moyes accepts that, without points on the board, it will become academic. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer about the January budget just yet; I hope to know more shortly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to win some games between now and January and make sure we\u2019re in a position to be in the ball game \u2013 then it could become a crucial month.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>This week\u2019s release of Marvel\u2019s latest, Doctor Strange, brings magic, sorcery, extra-dimensional travel and, most importantly, well-tailored robes into the comic book film universe.

The character rose to prominence just as the American counterculture was beginning to dabble in forms of spirituality outside of the Judeo-Christian establishment. The adventures of Stephen Strange tapped into eastern mysticism, psychedelic trips into alternate realities, and the absolute certainty that there is more to existence than what you can see with your eyes. (In fact, Doctor Strange possesses a third eye \u2013 the Eye of Agamotto, an amulet he wears around his neck that gives him special abilities such as time travel.) The mystical might not be in fashion today (save for your Williamsburg or Silver Lake denizens carving out a weekend to take ayahuasca), but in the 1960s it was at the forefront of the national conversation in the US.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The world of the supernatural and the darkly spiritual loomed large on the pop culture landscape around the time of Doctor Strange\u2019s creation. Acts such as the Doors, David Bowie and Jefferson Airplane were singing about all manner of mind-expanding experiences. Movies such as Rosemary\u2019s Baby, the Exorcist, the Omen, the Wicker Man and the Devils portrayed black magic, paganism and the like in direct opposition to the benign tenets of Christianity. In these movies, the devil is real and he uses his power to seduce the physical realm with impunity. One could point to the fallout from the hippie movement\u2019s fascination with psychotropics and the aftermath of the Charles Manson killings as the impetus for the interest in such things, but Rosemary\u2019s Baby (directed by Roman Polanski, whose pregnant wife Sharon Tate was a Manson victim) came out before Manson, Altamont and the end of the so-called Summer of Love.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/30/doctor-strange-observer-reveiw\">Doctor Strange review \u2013 sharp wit and spiritual popcorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike those films, which were targeted at adults, Doctor Strange was (and is) for children. Selling a story about black magic to kids was no easy feat, especially one that existed in an approximation of the real world rather than a made-up realm where the \u201cnatural rules\u201d, as they\u2019re referred to in the Strange film, don\u2019t apply. In 1974, Steve Englehart, Neal Adams and Frank Brunner created the character Sise-neg (Genesis spelled backwards) in the pages of the Marvel Premiere series starring Doctor Strange. Sise-neg was a sorcerer rival of Strange who used time travel to destroy the universe, then recreate it in his image. In the end, he merely recreates the universe as it was, broaching the question of whether or not this being was actually God itself. The religious implications were so controversial that Marvel editor Stan Lee considered retracting the entire story until Englehart and Brunner published a fake letter from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://comicvine.gamespot.com/marvel-premiere-14-sise-neg-genesis/4000-14131/user-reviews/2200-30159/\">a fictional minister praising the work</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It\u2019s Doctor Strange\u2019s connection to our conception of reality that opens him up to such criticism. Setting a fantasy story in a far-off land, alternative universe or parallel reality affords the writer a freedom from allegations of apostasy or heretical thinking. The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Golden Compass and countless other stories that might seem blasphemous to the true believer get off the hook because they don\u2019t exist in our conception of reality. Often, these works dabble within a world that resembles the distant past, which further removes it from those thorny questions of divinity. Star Wars pulled off that sleight of hand while still getting to play around with sci-fi iconography by explaining in the first frame of the movie that it was a story from \u201ca long time ago, in a galaxy far far away\u201d. George Lucas could invent an entire religion that governs the fate of the universe while never once having to connect that to people\u2019s actual belief systems. Star Trek (and also Asimov\u2019s seminal Foundation trilogy), on the other hand, is a covertly atheist story about humanity overcoming conflict through science and reason.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a4fe31e627eeeaa3b8e1b701e1fc3bc0c3bf5838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4fe31e627eeeaa3b8e1b701e1fc3bc0c3bf5838/0_264_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Witch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Witch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the 80s, the Indiana Jones series posited that pretty much every religious or occult myth was real \u2013 the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail, Hinduism, etc. Does it matter that Jesus, Kali Ma and aliens from another dimension all exist? I guess not. Perhaps they\u2019re all pals in some far-off land. In the 90s, The Blair Witch Project, The Craft, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the hugely popular X-Files series all carried the banner of the occult in culture. The X-Files made a lot out of the debate over faith v science and religion v the paranormal, often cracking the audience over the head with a giant wooden cross of thudding symbolism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/nov/02/doctor-strange-psychedelic-dna-pink-floyd\">Why Doctor Strange shares its psychedelic DNA with Pink Floyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2016, Charlie Brooker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/16/black-mirror-first-look-review-charlie-brooker\">Black Mirror generates scares</a> by showing that our greatest inventions will be our undoing, or more accurately, that our hubris and desire to overcome our physical limitations are ultimately destructive \u2013 a notion film-makers such as David Cronenberg were playing with parallel to the last occult boom in pop culture in the body horror works of Videodrome and Scanners. The occult retains a modicum of its power to terrify in the age of the iPhone, though. Even though the Blair Witch sequel/reboot failed to relaunch that franchise, 2015\u2019s The Witch was very much in the tradition of the classic occult horror films while also succeeding at the specialty box office.<br></p> <p>The Doctor Strange film digs up these old-timey notions of spirituality and inverts them. Here, the occult can set you free. It can be used to save humanity. More importantly, it exists in a world very much like our own. Sure, Doctor Strange hangs out in the Sanctum Sanctorum and his battles with Dormammu or Baron Mordo usually take place in some other realm, but that Sanctum sits on Bleecker Street in a fictional version of the real Manhattan. He\u2019s just a regular guy who learned to manipulate the spiritual realm through years of study, not a wizard designated as such by genetics. Notions like fate and familial superiority, which are prevalent in Star Wars and Harry Potter, are forsaken in favor of the more traditionally puritanical American ideal of hard work. His sidekick, Wong, might tell him he\u2019s born to study the mystical arts, but that\u2019s not because his dad was a sorcerer. There may not be the hi-tech gadgets of something like Ghostbusters, but Doctor Strange shares with those futuristic paranormal fantasies the idea that no matter what the discipline, knowledge is power.</p>",

One is simply that it is a rollicking good story about family secrets, the unintended consequences of actions and how, in trying to look after our own, we can destroy them and ourselves. The others are the very fine performances from Penny Downie and Alex Waldmann as the mother and son locked in a desperate dance to avoid the truth.</p> <p>Waldmann plays Chris, a war veteran who has joined the family business after his father\u2019s partner, Steve, was jailed for supplying defective aeroplane parts that led to the deaths of 21 airmen. His father, Joe, was exonerated by the court. Downie plays Kate, who cannot accept that her elder son, Larry, who has been missing in action for three years, is dead. But is Kate side-stepping an even nastier truth? Downie hauntingly suggests the madness that takes hold when you are living a lie, and Waldmann is subtle and complex, as Chris discovers that principles come with a price tag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4f3c96ce4024b1943cbf522c8c45e1b01fbd221\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4f3c96ce4024b1943cbf522c8c45e1b01fbd221/0_2_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Horovitch as Joe and Penny Downie as Kate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Horovitch as Joe and Penny Downie as Kate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Douet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is good support from David Horovitch as the blustering Joe, and Edward Harrison as Steve\u2019s son George, corroded by bitterness and impotent regret.

For politicians who want to overhaul 18C, Friday\u2019s outcome was always going to be a case of heads we win, tails we win.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/04/david-leyonhjelm-calls-for-repeal-of-18c-in-return-for-his-vote-on-industrial-relations\">David Leyonhjelm calls for repeal of 18C in return for his vote on industrial relations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the case was thrown out, the outcome would be spun by the anti-18C brigade as an example of everything that\u2019s wrong with the provision, because look at all the time, stress and resources that have gone into defending an action that never should have proceeded this far.</p> <p>If the case proceeded, then this would be proof positive that the law is an ass. Just for the record, the case was thrown out.</p> <p>Before it was even announced, Friday\u2019s decision was being hyped in certain quarters as a landmark and a turning point but, in reality, is nothing of the kind. Here\u2019s what you need to know about what happens next.</p> <p>Overhauling 18C has emerged as a key test by which Liberal leaders are judged.</p> <p>The contemporary right, while dabbling liberally in identity politics frolics of its own, is obsessed with pushing back on the identity politics and the rights agenda of the left.</p> <p>Tony Abbott tried and failed to overhaul 18C, which is one of the main reasons he lost the support of conservatives to remain prime minister last September.</p> <p>Almost immediately after the July election, conservatives in the government moved to make 18C Turnbull\u2019s test <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/30/cory-bernardis-racial-discrimination-revolt-supported-by-up-to-20-senators\">and they have not let up since</a>.</p> <p>It has been obvious for some time that Turnbull is going to have to replay this debate in some shape or form. The internals demand it.</p> <p>So the prime minister has in the past couple of weeks, and again on Friday, signalled support for a parliamentary investigation by the human rights committee \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/oct/28/broaden-free-speech-debate-beyond-racial-discrimination-act-says-liberal-senator\">an idea being pushed by the Liberal senator Dean Smith.</a></p> <p>The Smith proposal would wrap up consideration of 18C in a more broad-ranging inquiry looking at freedom of expression, which would bring other issues into the mix, like the defamation law for example, which well-resourced individuals, like politicians, tend to make liberal use of.</p> <p>Even though the evidence suggests we really don\u2019t have a problem with 18C as it currently stands \u2013 most cases are resolved at conciliation, only 1% of the complaints last year ever made it to the inside of a courtroom \u2013 the Smith inquiry is not a terrible idea.</p> <p>It would make 18C, the sequel, something of a fair fight.</p> <p>Community groups can have their say. (Again, yes I know, sorry folks.) It would allow consideration of the 18C restrictions alongside the other curbs that currently exist on speech in Australia \u2013 the ones politicians don\u2019t generally rush to complain about, the sorts of curbs on free speech that work to protect the powerful, as opposed to the curbs that work to protect the vulnerable.</p> <p>To put this most simply: a process like the one Smith envisages would test just how free the \u201cfreedom\u201d crowd really wants things to be and whether, when push came to shove, some freedoms proved to be more equal than others.</p> <p>For what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s what I think about removing the words insult and offend from the RDA.</p> <p>As a journalist I support removing as many curbs on free expression and free publication as possible. I have a professional interest, in fact, in removing as many curbs on free expression as possible.</p> <p>So I\u2019m happy to countenance a rebalancing of the RDA, provided the rebalancing of the free speech framework is proportionate and fair. I\u2019m not happy to leave restrictions in place that aid the powerful while going after restrictions that protect the vulnerable. Reasonableness in all the circumstances has to be the threshold test.</p> <p>The other caveat I\u2019d add to my professional support for speech and communication to be as unfettered as possible is I am a white woman of Anglo-Celtic descent. It\u2019s fair to say I\u2019m about as white as it\u2019s possible to be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/01/cory-bernardi-welcomes-free-speech-inquiry-if-it-leads-to-overhaul-of-18c\">Cory Bernardi welcomes free speech inquiry if it leads to overhaul of 18C</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While I have encountered nasty, deeply distressing sexism and casual acts of workplace discrimination; while I\u2019ve been patronised, pitied, marginalised, talked over top of; while I\u2019ve been the unhappy recipient of the unsolicited mansplain \u2013 I have never encountered racism.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what that feels like. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be insulted or offended <em>on the basis of my race</em> and that\u2019s what the provision prevents.</p> <p>Section 18C doesn\u2019t prevent people insulting or offending each other in the ordinary course of events. My inviolable human right to call someone a dickhead at a barbecue remains untrammelled.</p> <p>And before we rush to wind back the existing racial discrimination protections on the basis they are an inconvenience for the poor, oppressed, white culture warrior of a certain age, who, like me, have almost certainly never been insulted on the basis of their race \u2013 we need to stop and listen to the voices of people who have.</p>",

Make sure you make each approach really personal and specific to that agency, their clients and their work.\u201d Also check the IPA\u2019s website regularly as agencies advertise internships on there.</p> <p>For those already in the ad industry who wish to jump sides from client to agency, Bruges advises approaching the agencies you\u2019ve worked with to see if it\u2019s possible to gain some experience from their side of the fence.</p> <p>\u201cMany of our clients like their staff to get direct agency experience and all agencies want to understand their clients\u2019 business better so these placements can be of great benefit to both sides,\u201d says Bruges. \u201cYou will also better understand what it\u2019s like to be in a service business, and can make sure that suits you.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/tips-to-get-a-job-in-advertising\">Getting a job in advertising: top 10 tips</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Write a succinct and targeted CV</h2> <p>Look at how you position yourself on your CV. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make it sing for the audience,\u201d says Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk\">Guardian Media Group</a>. \u201cSo, what discipline is it that you\u2019d like to get into at an agency? If it\u2019s account management, for example, it might be worth thinking about the skills required to be an outstanding account handler and making sure that a) you have them and b) you\u2019re able to demonstrate their performance at a high level. Once you can do this, focus your CV so it demonstrates these skills at every turn.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Know the latest trends</h2> <p>To stand out from the crowds when it comes to interviews, it\u2019s also worth keeping abreast of what\u2019s happening in and around the industry. \u201cI know the digital world is constantly changing so read up on the latest advertising trends, social media trends, and always have good examples of what has worked, even just from noticing good TV ads or Facebook ads. Recruiters want to know you have an eye for good advertising,\u201d says Lowthrop.</p> <p>And a final word of advice from Diana Caplinska, a strategist with experience across brand, communications and innovation. \u201cIn the world of ideas, you will find yourself presenting personal thoughts to big groups of people who will push back on them, again and again.\u201d With criticism coming in quick and fast, you\u2019ll need to develop a thick skin.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?

  "<p>When Manish Kumar first came to the village of Harisal in western India in July, he didn\u2019t think he could stay there for very long.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt was monsoon, so it was difficult to reach because the roads were bad. There was no phone signal, and the electricity only comes on for a few hours in the evening. The people there are farmers, so they wake up early. They work all day, and then in the evening they eat dinner before dark. And then they go to sleep. There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d</p> <p>But the typical agricultural setting of Harisal was about to change. Kumar, the network head of a rural internet provider AirJaldi had come to transform it into India\u2019s first digital village, under a scheme backed by the Indian government and software giant Microsoft.</p> <p>\u201cWe set up a Wi-Fi tower and three smaller hotspots. At first, people were struggling to get online, they didn\u2019t know how to sign on, and we had to teach them. Now, when I visit the village, the kids come to us and teach us how to get the internet working.\u201d<br></p> <p>About 2,000 villagers live in Harisal. There are only five or six laptops in the village, but almost every household has a smartphone. For them, the new Wi-Fi connection changed their lives overnight. </p> <p>\u201cWe finally feel connected to the rest of the world,\u201d says Jagdishkumar Someshwar Sirsat, the headmaster of the village school. \u201cIt\u2019s made small tasks easier. For example, we had to give attendance records to the state government. Before, someone would have to hand deliver those to the government office in the city. Now, we can just fill out a form online, and its done,\u201d he says. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-free-basics-india-zuckerberg\">The inside story of Facebook\u2019s biggest setback | Rahul Bhatia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd for the children \u2013 sometimes the textbooks don\u2019t have enough information, or some things are not up to date. Now that they have internet, they can go online and look up whatever they\u2019re interested in. For the older kids, we\u2019re using online tutorials on YouTube and educational video blogs to teach them new things. They love it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sheetal Thorat, a doctor in Harisal, says internet connections could save lives. \u201cIn the village, there are no specialists for the heart or brain. There\u2019s just me and two other field doctors for the whole village, and we\u2019re general practitioners. Now that we have Wi-Fi, we can set up consultations with heart or brain specialists in Mumbai, and then they can send back reports online.\u201d </p> <p>Microsoft funded the project, and plans to get 50 more villages around Harisal online. Bhaskar Pramanik, chairman of Microsoft India, says its project to get villages online is philanthropic. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any commercial interest in these projects. We want telecom and other service providers to use the connectivity to provide citizens with useful services,\u201d he says. Microsoft has also <a href=\"http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2016/10/12/how-closing-the-digital-divide-is-saving-lives-in-botswana/#sm.0000msa6iz17bdesgwrdjrn2gslxc\" rel=\"nofollow\">previously said</a> it would be good for its own business if more people were online.<br></p> <h2>Google and Facebook join online push</h2> <p>Microsoft is not alone in the race to get India online. Google has launched a scheme to provide free public Wi-Fi at 100 railway stations. About 3.5m users have already connected to Google\u2019s station Wi-Fi service, with an estimated 15,000 people coming online for the first time every day thanks to the scheme.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to expand to new venues, like cafes and malls, to help more people get online, and we\u2019re looking for strategic and forwarding-thinking partners to work with on this effort,\u201d says Caeser Sengupta, vice-president of Google\u2019s \u201cNext Billion Users\u201d team.</p> <p>Last year, Facebook tried to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/facebook-free-basics-india-zuckerberg\">launch Free Basics</a>, which would have allowed people in rural India free access to websites chosen by the company, but the plan was blocked after millions wrote to the telecoms authority saying the scheme would give Facebook too much power. Now, the company has come up with a new scheme, Express Wi-Fi, which will allow those in rural India to buy fast, cheap and reliable mobile data packs. <br></p> <p>India\u2019s rapidly developing economy, and increasing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/13/smartphone-explosion-2014-india-us-china-firefoxos-android\">smartphone penetration</a> presents a huge opportunity for tech firms, who are looking for new markets to expand their products and services, as growth in western economies slows. <br></p> <p>According to the World Bank\u2019s <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.P2?locations=IN\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest figures</a>, 26% of India\u2019s 1.25 billion population has internet access. In 2014\u201315, 60 million, equivalent to the entire UK population, went online for the first time. About 900 million people in India, mostly in rural areas, are offline. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/15/india-net-neutrality-activists-facebook-free-basics\">'Poor internet for poor people': India's activists fight Facebook connection plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIndia is the only major economy in the world that had a year-on-year growth in internet and smartphone users,\u201d says Vikas Kothari, tech analyst at venture capital firm Lightbox. \u201cLarge players like Google, Facebook and Microsoft are looking for their next set of billion users and India looks the most promising.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Internet access could transform economy</h2> <p>Facebook has not yet released details of how much profit it expects to make from its Express Wi-Fi service, or how much investment will be needed to subsidise rural data access, but the company says that internet access will benefit everybody. </p> <p>\u201cInternet access means opportunity. It enables progress. It improves knowledge, economies, lives and communities,\u201d says a Facebook spokesperson. <br></p> <p>The tech companies may appear benevolent, but Kothari says they will all benefit if India\u2019s internet accessibility increases. \u201cIn a [digital] ecosystem when infrastructure improves, the biggest beneficiaries are the large players,\u201d he explains. <br></p> <p>Kothari says the tech giants see India as a long-term investment. \u201cThe most visited sites or apps in India are Google Search, Play Store, YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook. Google and Facebook\u2019s business models don\u2019t depend on a fee, but on user data. If more people use their products, the more data they get, thus increasing their ad revenues.\u201d<br></p> <p>For India, better internet infrastructure could transform the economy, and the lives of ordinary citizens. \u201cImproved connectivity will further democratise access to education, healthcare and financial services. People in remote areas will get access to skill-development courses, tertiary telemedicine and reports on agriculture and commodity prices, thus improving their lives,\u201d says Kothari. <br></p>"
