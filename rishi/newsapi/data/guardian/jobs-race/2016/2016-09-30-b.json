  "<p>\u201cI have had several thousand people over the course of the past two years ask me some variation of this question,\u201d Shaun King, the New York Daily News writer and activist, said. \u201cWhat else can I do about police brutality? Beyond what we\u2019re doing right now, what else can I do?\u201d The inquiry is something he has spent months \u201cnoodling around in [his] head\u201d, King told the Guardian.</p> <p>King and others believe the answer could be boycotts, a tool of change wielded in recent years against racial injustice and used during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Last week, King revealed plans for what he hopes will be a massive and prolonged boycott, slated to begin in December. A few days earlier, the actor Isaiah Washington had announced his own, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://time.com/4507756/actor-isaiah-washington-wants-black-americans-to-boycott-work-on-monday/\">making headlines</a> for his call on African Americans to boycott working, shopping and going to school for 24 hours as part of his #StayAtHomeSeptember262016 movement. Like the boycotts that came before them, both men are hoping their actions will create pressure on policymakers and bring about change.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s boycott also began with a question. \u201cImagine if every single African American in the United States that was really fed up with being angry, sad and disgusted, would pick ONE DAY to simply \u2018stay at home\u2019 from every single job, work site, sports arena and government office in the United States of America,\u201d the actor <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/isaiahwashington46/posts/10209222354172526\">asked his followers on Facebook</a>. \u201cI\u2019m very sure that within 72 hours from Wall Street to the NFL \u2026 Black Lives Would Matter.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The inspiration for the inquiry, Washington said, came from \u201cmy confusion, my pain, my distaste of the loss of a friend who was fighting for freedom\u201d, meaning Darren Seals, an activist and protest leader from Ferguson, Missouri, who was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/ferguson-protest-leader-darren-seals-shot-dead-burning-car\">found shot dead in a burning car</a> earlier this month.

We don\u2019t have the luxury to organize,\u201d Washington added. His boycott had been criticized for being planned too quickly; King\u2019s is planned for three months in the future.</p> <p>One of their intentions with the stay-at-home boycott, McCullough said, was safety. \u201cWhen we\u2019re out in the streets, and we\u2019re protesting and marching, our people are still getting injured, they\u2019re still getting killed, they\u2019re still getting incarcerated,\u201d she said. \u201cOur thinking was it doesn\u2019t make any sense for us to be out here and protesting, then paying bail. It\u2019s the same as saying you\u2019re supporting the same system you\u2019re fighting against.\u201d Of the protests that have broken out around the country, many have been peaceful though there have been outlying moments . Last week, in North Carolina, one person <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/us/charlotte-police-shooting/\">was fatally shot</a> during a protest in Charlotte.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/isaiahwashington46/posts/10209300323361707?pnref=story\">On Facebook</a>, Washington elaborated the event on 26 September was merely \u201cPHASE I\u201d, and mentioned there will be a \u201cBusiness Target\u201d day in October. He advertised a second boycott for 7 November, which McCullough explained was planned by a group called Moving Forward. They would also be supporting King\u2019s boycott in December, McCullough said.</p> <p>McCullough, who started #Missing24 after the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/14/philando-castile-funeral-minnesota-police-shooting\">Philando Castile</a>, said she was inspired by reading about boycotts that happened in Zimbabwe and Sudan. In the US, boycotts of the shopping holiday Black Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/26/ferguson-protesters-police-brutality-black-friday-boycott\">began in 2014</a> after the death of Michael Brown, through campaigns or groups like <a href=\"http://www.notonedimeboycott.com/\">#NotOneDime</a> or <a href=\"http://www.blackoutforhumanrights.com/about-blackout.html\">Blackout for Human Rights</a>, a \u201cCollective of Filmmakers, Artists, Activists, Musicians, Lawyers, Tastemakers, Religious Leaders and Concerned Citizens\u201d, though it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/your-money/elusive-effects-of-the-black-friday-boycott.html\">unclear if they made an impact</a>. That Black Friday boycott <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/27/notonedime-black-friday-protest-african-americans-boycott-shopping\">continued in 2015</a>. Groups called for boycotts of businesses <a href=\"http://www.wafb.com/story/32401824/group-asks-public-to-boycott-some-baton-rouge-businesses\">in Baton Rouge</a> after the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/alton-sterling-death-ive-been-sick-ever-since-they-murdered-him\">Alton Sterling</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/calls-for-charlotte-boycott-after-police-shooting/2016/09/21/339cfb1c-8014-11e6-ad0e-ab0d12c779b1_video.html\">in Charlotte</a> and <a href=\"http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2016/09/26/black-lives-matter-group-calls-economic-protest/91117962/\">Asheville</a>, North Carolina, after Scott\u2019s death. Other groups have called for only buying from black-owned businesses or keeping money in <a href=\"http://blackoutcoalition.org/\">black-owned banks</a>.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s original post announcing the boycott received 28,000 shares on Facebook, but it\u2019s difficult to determine how many participated. Some expressed their support on social media using #StayAtHomeSeptember262016. McCullough said people from almost every state participated, most hailing from New York, California and Texas. Students at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, peacefully held signs and drums as they walked through different buildings on campus in solidarity with the movement, <a href=\"http://koin.com/2016/09/26/reed-college-students-boycott-class/\">KOIN6 News</a> reported.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/alicia-garza-on-the-beauty-and-the-burden-of-black-lives-matter\">Alicia Garza on the beauty and the burden of Black Lives Matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The boycott also had its critics, with some saying it was too quickly planned or that some couldn\u2019t afford to skip work. \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford to skip work, don\u2019t. Boycott in other ways,\u201d Washington said on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m not some wealthy jerk who is telling people to lose their jobs.\u201d Others brought up past remarks made by the actor, who currently stars on the TV show The 100 and was a recurring character on Grey\u2019s Anatomy from 2005 to 2007. The public speculated that the controversial remarks caused the actor to be removed from the latter show. When asked to address those critics, Washington said, \u201cThis is about life, liberty and freedom under the constitution of the United States of America. It\u2019s not about me.\u201d </p> <p>King\u2019s boycott was planned with a nod to boycotts of the past, occurring on 5 December, \u201cthe same date that our ancestors began the 381 day long Montgomery Bus Boycott. It is going to take that same type of determination and organization for us to actually make this boycott count\u201d, he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/injusticeboycott/posts/897245660408832\">a message</a> to the more than 75,000 people who had signed up thus far. The Montgomery bus boycott began in 1955 and ended with a supreme court declaration that segregated buses were unconstitutional. He also took inspiration from the treatment of North Carolina in light of their <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/01/north-carolina-transgender-bathroom-law\">transgender bathroom law</a>.</p> <p>So far, King has released a basic framework for what he hopes his boycott will look like, with targeted boycotting of brands, institutions, cities and states tied to specific reforms. He hopes millions will eventually participate.</p> <p>While Washington\u2019s #StayAtHomeSeptember262016 was for one day, King thinks his should be in addition to the protests and rallies around the country. He intends for it to last indefinitely, until reforms are made, which he admittedly thinks will take a while. \u201cThe United States right now is very resistant to change and very resistant to change on a number of issues, not just racial violence and police brutality,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean King doesn\u2019t have hope, both that a boycott will be effective and be an answer for those he worries are hopeless, wondering what they can do.</p>",
  "<p>Black Americans are in challenging, critical times. We matter enough to sell out concert stadiums and win prestigious awards touting our intellectual prowess \u2013 as Claudia Rankine did this week, when she won the MacArthur genius grant. But we don\u2019t matter enough to keep us from being murdered by the police. There is something devastatingly perverse about that fact.<br></p> <p>Claudia Rankine\u2019s win is one of the best things to happen to black folks in 2016. Her award, along with those of her fellow black recipients in this year\u2019s MacArthur crop \u2013 the art historian and curator Kellie Jones, the film-maker Barry Jacobs-Jenkins and the sculptor Joyce Scott \u2013 signals a moment of nationwide reckoning. It is also a reminder that we cannot \u2013 and will not \u2013 stand for the routine violence or the default dehumanization of black bodies. </p> <p>Rankine is not just seeking to shift the cultural dialogue, although that is important too. She is \u201ctrying to change the discourse of black people being equated with criminality and murdered inside a culture where white fear has justified the continued incarceration, murder of blacks and other people of color\u201d.</p> <p>When Rankine won the grant, she told the Los Angeles Times she felt <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-claudia-rankine-20160921-snap-story.html\">\u201cthe prize is being given to the subject\u201d </a>of race. Rankine is perhaps the first black recipient to make resolutely clear that the subject of race is bigger than any given individual. It also makes the MacArthur Foundation a model for institutions prioritizing the need to deconstruct and decentralize whiteness in America \u2013 a construct which is directly linked to police killings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/i-thought-i-was-a-gorgeous-kid-until-i-learned-i-was-just-pretty-for-a-black-girl\">I thought I was a gorgeous kid until I learned I was just 'pretty, for a black girl' | Rebecca Carroll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rankine may use some of the MacArthur money for what she is calling the Racial Imaginary Institute. It\u2019s a project that was in development before she won the award, which she says will be \u201can interdisciplinary arts and cultural laboratory for the dismantling of white dominance\u201d. Amen.</p> <p>In all of her work, Rankine reminds us that what black folks do as a culture \u2013 one that has never squandered anything, was never meant to be here, much less thrive and achieve \u2013 can be used to further the effort of cultivating a sense of agency without asking for permission. This is the very best of what Black Lives Matter and other black activists stand for: we are not here for the validation, we are here for each other \u2013 the living and the dead.<br></p> <p>Long before she won the MacArthur, Rankine was an ambassador of this truth and visionary mandate. \u201cUnlike earlier black-power movements that tried to fight or segregate for self-preservation,\u201d Rankine wrote in an essay for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/magazine/the-condition-of-black-life-is-one-of-mourning.html?_r=0\">the New York Times last year</a>, \u201cBlack Lives Matter aligns with the dead, continues the mourning and refuses the forgetting in front of all of us.\u201d<br></p> <p>And as we celebrate the successes of black culture luminaries like Rankine, who push past limitations, cast aside America\u2019s glaring white gaze and exceed societal expectations, we continue to recognize our daily losses to the police and institutional racism everywhere. How poignant and essential, then, that our artists \u2013 the oracles of our magnificent, messy existence \u2013 build on this paradox in rigorous, centered and imaginative ways, every day.</p>",
  "<p>Raised in Compton, and educated in African American studies at UCLA, film-maker Ava DuVernay said that her life experiences have left the ravages of the US criminal justice system a subject very close to her heart.</p> <p>\u201cHaving had the experience of being around folks who have been touched by mass incarceration\u201d along with an education that offered a \u201cframework for why and how things are happening\u201d has had a major impact on the acclaimed director of Selma.</p> <p>This proximity was largely behind her decision to embark on 13th, a full-length feature documentary on the racialized history of the criminal justice system and mass incarceration that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/19/ava-duvernay-the-13th-documentary-new-york-film-festival\">opens this year\u2019s New York film festival</a>.

The US is home to 5% of the world\u2019s population, but 25% of the world\u2019s prisoners. One in three young black men in the US today can expect to serve time in prison during their life. The prison population has grown exponentially since the 1980s-era war on drugs began in earnest, ballooning from a few hundred thousand to over two million today, with black people heinously overrepresented among them.</p> <p>But DuVernay\u2019s 100-minute voyage through the legacy of the criminalization of black Americans does more than rattle off statistics. Weaving a historical narrative from slavery through the present, the film and its contributors trace in stark relief, the various transmutations that the oppression of the black body in America has taken, and the ways that criminal justice has been recruited to that end.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V66F3WU2CKk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V66F3WU2CKk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Michelle Alexander, author of the bestselling book The New Jim Crow, explains in the film how in the post-civil war south, petty offenses were used to recapture newly freed blacks and force them into free labor under convict lend-lease programs that functionally reconstituted chattel enslavement.

From her recent essay detailing the alleged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/sep/14/michelle-kambasha-why-i-do-belong-as-a-black-woman-in-the-white-world-of-indie\">racially-motivated abuse</a> she and her family received at <a href=\"http://saintheron.com/featured/and-do-you-belong-i-do/\">a Kraftwerk concert</a>, to her support of the Black Lives Matter movement, A Seat at the Table \u2013 the title itself a nod to giving voice to the voiceless and creating a level platform for change \u2013 is imbued with a sense of trying to make sense of the world.

Later, on the Q-Tip-assisted Borderline (An Ode to Self Care) she sighs: \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d So, while there\u2019s anger and frustration throughout A Seat at the Table, it\u2019s often presented calmly, almost matter-of-factly.

Revolving around the line, \u201cThis shit is for us\u201d, Solange places herself directly in the song\u2019s celebration of blackness when she sings: \u201cI hope my son will bang this song so loud, that he almost makes his walls fall down, cos his momma wants to make him proud, oh to be us.\u201d It\u2019s a joyous moment. </p> <p>Similarly joyous is the synthetic funk of Junie, a song dedicated to Ohio Players legend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/solangeknowles/status/781582002004828162\">Junie Morrison</a>, while the zigzagging electronic pulse and cascading vocals of Don\u2019t You Wait recall the softer moments on True. The airy Cranes in the Sky, meanwhile, must be the prettiest song ever about trying to alleviate the thick fog of sadness (\u201cI tried to dance it away\u201d). Once again, her voice \u2013 assisted by forgotten R&amp;B singer Tweet \u2013 is almost unspeakably lovely.</p> <p>Anyone hoping for another Losing You, or Sandcastle Disco from her undervalued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/15/urban1\">Sol-Angel and the Hadley St Dreams</a> album, is likely to be initially disappointed by A Seat at the Table. Clearly crafted to be listened to as a full album, songs segue into each other with the interludes helping to govern tone and move the album through its various moods. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/23/blood-orange-freetown-sound-review-dev-hynes\">Blood Orange\u2019</a>s equally sprawling Freetown Sound, it\u2019s an album that unfurls at its own pace, each song packed with as many melodic flourishes as you\u2019d get across whole albums by many artists. Its delicate anger and the measured way it unpacks a host of issues means you want to give it the time it deserves rather than demanding it reveal itself immediately. There\u2019s a unique brilliance to that.</p>",

It was snidely suggested that because the three winners were women, and two were from the Caribbean, that their success was \u201cnot entirely a surprise, though still rather gobsmacking\u201d, because of gendered and racial nepotism on Booker\u2019s part.

This isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve voiced this idea; when Sarah Howe won the TS Eliot prize this year, Private Eye leapt on that achievement too, musing that she won because she was young and attractive (or \u201cextra-poetic reasons \u2026 as a successful and very \u2018presentable\u2019 young woman\u201d).<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/23/deranged-poetess-sarah-howe-ts-eliot-prize-media\">TS Eliot prize row: is winner too young, beautiful - and Chinese?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It worries me that in this post-EU referendum climate, when hate crime is rising and newspapers are filled with intolerance and fear-mongering, a writer among us found time and energy to see a conspiracy in there being more than one POC in a room of poets and artists.

So with Capildeo, that is three POC winners in a row. Should there have been a white winner in between somewhere? Without new faces, new stories and new blood in poetry, we\u2019re lost, holding to dog-eared copies of Birthday Letters<em> </em>like rafts adrift at sea, clinging on to ideas of what poetry once was instead of celebrating what it is now.</p> <p>As a poet and a woman of colour, it seems that even by writing this, I could be accused of nepotism like Booker. I don\u2019t know any of the winning poets and I\u2019ve never been published by Peepal Tree. But I celebrate when I see the likes of Booker on judging panels and I felt proud of all three winners. Why? Because maybe every time a new poet breaks through, a crack of light shines on the rest of our efforts. But think about this: would anyone ever make note of three white winners in a row?

It\u2019s no coincidence that Marvel\u2019s latest TV superhero wears a plain old hoodie, just as Trayvon Martin did, rather than a colourful cape, nor that the show is set in Harlem, often considered the heartland of black America.</p> <p>In 1972, Cage became Marvel\u2019s first black superhero to get his own comic-book. Back then he was classic Blaxploitation \u2013 all open-chested yellow jacket, chain belt and steel tiara (its purpose never explained).

He\u2019s a warm-hearted symbol of black power, a public rebuke to those who judge by skin colour. When we first meet him, Cage is struggling to pay the rent in menial jobs at his local barbershop and a nightclub, living hand-to-mouth in gentrifying Harlem. But the death of an innocent loved one, the avuncular barbershop owner Pops, sees him find his inner hero.

But the show\u2019s strength lies in that slow-burn intrigue, as well as its soulful vision of African-American culture. Every time the camera visits villain Cottonmouth\u2019s slick nightclub, Paradise, there\u2019s another legend on stage, from Charles Bradley and Faith Evans to Raphael Saadiq.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise that this is where Cage meets supercool cop Misty Knight (newcomer Simone Missick), a staple of the comics who could well be the show\u2019s breakout character. She may have lost her bionic arm in the 2016 update, but it\u2019s made up for with a superpower that allows her to mentally rearrange crime scenes in real time.

  "<p>Britain\u2019s most senior counter-terrorism official and a police leader who was David Cameron\u2019s favourite chief constable have emerged as the most likely candidates to replace Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe as the Met police commissioner.</p> <p>On Thursday Hogan-Howe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/sir-bernard-hogan-howe-to-retire-as-met-police-commissioner\">announced his retirement</a> seven months early, insisting it had nothing to do with tensions with his new political masters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/metropolitan-police-commissioner-bernard-hogan-howe\">Who should be the next Metropolitan police commissioner? | Duncan Campbell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hogan-Howe completed a full five-year term this month \u2013 the first Metropolitan police commissioner not to be ousted from office in a decade \u2013 and was expected to continue for another year. He will now retire in February, halfway through the one-year extension to his original contract.</p> <p>His announcement came ahead of the release next month of a report on the Met\u2019s handling of historical sex abuse cases, which is expected to be critical, though probably not of the commissioner. The Met is facing \u00a3400m of budget cuts by 2020, on top of significant cuts it has already undergone.</p> <p>One police source said the commissioner\u2019s \u201clong-term aim was to go at a time of his own choosing\u201d, and that was what he had done. The lack of an obvious successor led to speculation that Hogan-Howe might have stayed on for a year or so longer, and his early departure created speculation that he had a difficult relationship with new mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.</p> <p>Among those who may apply for the \u00a3276,000-a-year post are Mark Rowley, an assistant commissioner of the Met who oversees counter-terrorism. In that role he has got to know key politicians who will choose the next commissioner, namely the current home secretary, Amber Rudd, Theresa May and Khan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89470fb5c91097a35384b57d13115e50419fdc99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89470fb5c91097a35384b57d13115e50419fdc99/0_547_2073_1243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner of the Met who oversees counter-terrorism\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner of the Met who oversees counter-terrorism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The other main contender is Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council and former head of the Thames Valley force, bordering London.

But the prime minister will have a large if not decisive say, and the choice of the next Met commissioner presents a chance to bring more radical reform to policing and its biggest regional force.</p> <p>Khan, elected for Labour in May, said Hogan-Howe had decided himself to stand down. He said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to go, we worked incredibly well together. But I am grateful he gave me and the home secretary sufficient notice.\u201d</p> <p>There had been some tension between the new Labour mayor and the commissioner, who was appointed in 2011 by Khan\u2019s Conservative predecessor, Boris Johnson, and May, then home secretary. They wanted a \u201ccrimefighter\u201d, and someone who would not habitually criticise swingeing government changes to policing that officers hated.</p> <p>The outgoing Met commissioner said the force needed a \u201cfresh approach\u201d and a leader with new ideas. Hogan-Howe told LBC Radio: \u201cFive years is quite a long time in this job. I\u2019m not complaining but I work 70-odd hours a week. I love it and I love being at work.\u201d</p> <p>He said the demands \u201cbrings its own stress and strains\u201d and he had wanted his departure date to be a surprise. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any leader should announce their departure. All that happens is your power fritters away.</p> <p>\u201cSo I think those people need new ideas and a new thought. I think I came with certain ideas and I hope they\u2019ve been good ideas. But I think at times you need somebody with fresh ones, and I think if you\u2019re not careful it\u2019s really hard for your own staff to turn round and say, \u2018You know, you\u2019re really passionate as I am about things like automatic number plate recognition, but Grandad, things have moved on.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/met-police-chief-contenders-favourites-long-shots\">Contenders for the next Met police chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tensions surfaced recently with Khan, who was elected in May, over the issue of spit hoods \u2013 pieces of fabric and mesh placed over detainees\u2019 heads to stop them spitting at or biting officers. Khan put pressure on the Met to reverse a decision to introduce the hoods this month. The force was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/06/met-police-to-start-using-spit-hoods-on-suspects-within-weeks\">planning to deploy them in custody areas</a>, but after the Guardian revealed the decision, the mayor\u2019s team was unhappy because it had not been consulted.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe said last week he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/22/met-police-lack-of-sensitivity-spit-hoods-bernard-hogan-howe\">accepted there had been a lack of sensitivity</a> over the decision and regretted that Khan had not been told. The mayor is supposed to oversee the Met, shaping its strategic priorities while not interfering in its operations.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe said: \u201cThis was our decision prior to the mayor and deputy mayor arriving. We didn\u2019t raise it with the new mayor or deputy mayor. I\u2019ve already acknowledged that probably, with retrospect, we didn\u2019t anticipate the response because we didn\u2019t think it was such a big issue. But clearly for people it has been.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan-Howe became commissioner on 12 September 2011, after London had been hit by the worst riots in modern English history. Crime fell by 18% during most of his time in office, though some categories are now rising.</p> <p>His predecessor, Sir Paul Stephenson, was forced from the job as a result of the phone-hacking scandal, and before him, Sir Ian Blair quit after he was told he had lost Johnson\u2019s confidence.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe\u2019s biggest achievement may well have been to show that the job of Met commissioner is not impossible, even though it is beset by political hurdles. The last commissioner of the Met to complete their term was Sir John Stevens in 2005. </p> <p>Colleagues say Hogan-Howe is politically astute. To meet the big reduction in government funding, the Met will soon move out of its current headquarters to a new building. It has cut \u00a3600m from its budget and Hogan-Howe, after much deliberation, spoke out against the Conservative government that appointed him.</p> <p>Hogan-Howe was unpopular in some sections of the media for the pursuit of journalists over phone-hacking and bribery claims. He also faced calls to quit over Operation Midland, an inquiry into claims VIPs had abused children decades ago. The operation is alleged to have spiralled out of control and collapsed without unearthing evidence of guilt.</p> <p>One of those investigated, the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, said: \u201cHe will walk away with a barrow-load of pension funds. I am left destitute. Is there any wonder that I believe Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe should leave in shame and should have left many months ago? </p> <p>\u201cHe is a disgrace to the police force of Britain. He has wrought havoc on the Metropolitan Police Service, whose good reputation he and other senior officers have tarnished in the last few years.\u201d </p> <p>Under Hogan-Howe\u2019s tenure, the Met successfully policed the 2012 London Olympics, but the officer who oversaw the Games soon left the organisation because Hogan-Howe had a particular vision of whom he wanted in his top team. </p> <p>The Met is regarded as having done a good job in the face of the heightened terrorist threat, although the government has considered passing the responsibility to the relatively new National Crime Agency, an idea the Met has so far successfully resisted.</p> <p>Met staff morale hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/07/majority-met-police-officers-not-confident-in-leadership\">record lows</a> in 2014 but the force maintained officer numbers at 32,000 as it restructured and tried to adapt to the changing nature of crime, particularly cyber offences.</p> <p>Rudd, the home secretary, said: \u201cSir Bernard has had a long and distinguished career as a determined crimefighter and an inspirational senior officer. He has shown remarkable and consistent dedication to public service.\u201d</p>",
