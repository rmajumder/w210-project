Emails between the company and police revealed that Geofeedia had developer-level access to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, which means it could review streams of user content in ways that regular members of the public cannot, according to the ACLU.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that third parties are making big money off of the sale and trading of our data with law enforcement is a huge problem and one that any social media user in this country or beyond should be disgusted and surprised by,\u201d said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, which has <a href=\"https://www.aclunc.org/sites/default/files/20161010_ACLU_CMJ_Color_of_Change_Joint_letter_Twitter.pdf\">urged</a> companies to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.aclunc.org/sites/default/files/20161010_ACLU_CMJ_Color_of_Change_Joint_letter_Facebook_Instagram.pdf\">end</a> their relationships with Geofeedia. \u201cIt clearly has a chilling effect on democratic protests.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The next step is making clear, transparent, accountable policies about their relationship with the police</p> <footer> <cite>Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instagram had provided Geofeedia access to Instagram\u2019s API, or application programming interface, which is a feed of data from users\u2019 public posts that includes their location, ACLU said. The photo-sharing service terminated access to the API last month, ACLU said. </p> <p>The ACLU said Facebook allowed Geofeedia to use its \u201cTopic Feed API\u201d, a tool geared toward media companies and brands that enabled Geofeedia to obtain a \u201cranked feed of public posts\u201d centered around specific hashtags, events or places.

  "<p>The former cabinet minister Francis Maude has taken a job advising an international law firm on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, six months after standing down from government. <br></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/francis-maude\">Lord Maude</a>, who until April was a trade and investment minister, has joined <a href=\"https://www.cov.com/\">Covington and Burling LLP</a> as a senior adviser in its government affairs practice. </p> <p>Law firms and the finance industry have been setting up Brexit units to advise clients on how to understand and shape UK policy and how their commercial interests will be affected by leaving the EU. </p> <p>The appointment coincides with further pressure on the government to clamp down on former ministers who want to take up roles in the private sector that may allow them to exploit their contacts. </p> <p>Maude\u2019s roles in government have made him one of the best connected figures in Whitehall following a 30-year career in parliament as an MP and minister. <br></p> <p>He was the minister for trade and investment under David Cameron from 2015 to 2016. Before that he was minister for the Cabinet Office and paymaster general under the 2010-15 coalition government, which brought him into contact with a succession of permanent secretaries. </p> <p>Covington, which works extensively in Europe, employs more than 120 former government officials, diplomats and regulators. It does not disclose any clients on the UK\u2019s statutory lobbying registers.<br></p> <p>Maude has also has taken up a role as chairman of the advertising agency Cogent Elliott, months after accepting a job on the advisory board at the alternative investment firm Anvest Partners.</p> <p>His roles have been approved by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) as long as he does not personally lobby ministers or officials for two years after leaving office or draw on privileged information. He is at liberty to advise others on how to do so, however. <br></p> <p>A spokesperson for Covington denied that Maude had taken up a lobbying job. \u201cFrancis Maude is not a lobbyist but a strategic adviser, who will be assisting the firm and its clients as they navigate complexities around Brexit,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>Covington is one of a number of firms advising clients on the consequences of the leave vote in June. </p> <p>The lobbying firm <a href=\"http://interelgroup.com/brexit-services/\">Interel</a>, which employs Liam Fox\u2019s former special adviser Oli Waghorn, promises to help clients to \u201cshape the post-Brexit regulatory and business environment\u201d. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hanovercomms.com/our-people/directors/charles-lewington/\">Hanover</a>, run by John Major\u2019s former press secretary Charles Lewington, has established a business advisory team to help clients navigate Brexit in order to \u201cprotect your bottom line\u201d.</p> <p>Last month it emerged that the former foreign secretary William Hague had been appointed to the \u201cBrexit client transition unit\u201d at the consultancy Teneo, whose clients include HSBC, Coca-Cola and Nissan. </p> <p>Meanwhile, MPs were warned on Tuesday that the revolving door of ministers and senior civil servants taking senior jobs in the private sector was now so prevalent that the boundary between the regulator and regulated had dissolved.</p> <p>Ian Hislop, the editor of Private Eye, which has campaign on the issue, told the Commons public administration committee that the current system was \u201copen to corruption\u201d and there had been a \u201cdisgraceful\u201d failure to prevent conflict of interests.</p> <p>Alexandra Runswick, director of the campaign group Unlock Democracy said the volume of people moving from senior roles in Whitehall to the private sector had significantly increased.</p> <p>\u201cCalling it a revolving door is almost too gentle a metaphor. It is more of a stampede,\u201d she told MPs. </p> <p>A new code of conduct has been proposed, under which MPs would be forced to drop lucrative outside jobs if they conflict with their jobs serving their constituents. </p> <p>The change in the rules \u2013 which are still to be approved by MPs \u2013 would radically cut back the amount of time MPs would be allowed to spend away from their constituents.<br></p> <p>The draft code has been signed off by members of the House of Commons standards committee before a six-week consultation.</p> <p>Tamasin Cave, of the campaign group <a href=\"http://www.spinwatch.org/\">Spinwatch</a>, said there was a steady stream of ex-ministers walking straight into companies that then used their insider knowledge and connections.<br><br>\u201cIt makes a joke of Theresa May\u2019s promise to listen to the public and not be swayed by the interests of the privileged few,\u201d Cave said. \u201cYou won\u2019t stop it, but the prime minister could open it up to scrutiny and let us see who is lobbying her government.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton now has an 11-percentage-point lead over her Republican opponent Donald Trump, according to a <a href=\"http://www.prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PRRIThe-Atlantic-Survey-Topline-Oct.-9.pdf\">poll</a> released by PRRI and the Atlantic on Tuesday. If that weren\u2019t already reason enough for Trump supporters to worry, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/327067170/161027-NBCWSJ-October-N-500-Poll\">poll</a> from NBC and the Wall Street Journal released on Monday put Clinton\u2019s lead at 14 percentage points. But why the difference in numbers?</p> <p>If you want to follow polls in the 28 remaining days before the US votes, I strongly recommend you ignore the date that the poll was published \u2013 and focus instead on the dates that the poll was conducted. That PRRI/Atlantic poll was based on landline and cellphone interviews that took place on 5-9 October while the data for the NBC/WSJ poll was gathered on 8-9 October.</p> <p>Those dates are potentially significant given that on 8 October, a 2005 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">recording</a> was released of Trump saying that, thanks to his fame, he was able to grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s highly likely that a larger proportion of respondents were interviewed <em tabindex=\"-1\">after</em> the Trump recording was made public in the NBC/WSJ poll compared with the PRRI/Atlantic poll. That could mean a 14-percentage-point lead is a more accurate indication of Clinton\u2019s current position in the race.</p> <p>But the crucial question is whether Clinton\u2019s lead is temporary or permanent. We\u2019ll need to keep an eye on numbers in the days ahead to understand that.</p> <p>In the meantime, though, it\u2019s worth looking beyond the horserace numbers that appear at the top of the survey and digging a little further. In the PRRI/Atlantic poll, I was curious about a question that provided the statement: \u201cThese days society seems to punish men just for acting like men\u201d \u2013 36% of respondents agreed. Another 41% agreed with the statement: \u201cSociety as a whole has become too soft and feminine.\u201d Those attitudes could provide useful information for understanding <em tabindex=\"-1\">why </em>voters might support their respective candidates.</p>",

  "<p>J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann has rejected Bob Bradley\u2019s claim that the former Germany star was jockeying to succeed him as USA coach a year before Bradley left.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/bob-bradley-jurgen-klinsmann-jockeying-usa-job\">Bob Bradley says J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann was 'jockeying' for USA job in 2010</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bradley made the claim on Friday when he was introduced as the new coach of Swansea City. He said of Klinsmann: \u201cWhen he did commentary on the 2010 World Cup, he was already jockeying for the job.\u201d</p> <p>Bradley was fired as the national team coach in 2011, shortly after a 4-2 defeat by Mexico in the Gold Cup final. He was replaced by Klinsmann, who had been out of work since leaving Bayern Munich in 2009. On Monday, however, Klinsmann insisted that he hadn\u2019t been angling for Bradley\u2019s job.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I mean it\u2019s simply not true,\u201d Klinsmann said in a press conference before his team\u2019s friendly against New Zealand on Tuesday night. \u201cI could have taken the job in 2006. I could have taken it in 2010. And then we got together in 2011 to finally figure out a way to make this happen. So I was not jockeying anything.\u201d</p> <p>Klinsmann was effusive in his praise of Bradley, who, in accepting the Swansea job, becomes the first American to coach in the Premier League.</p> <p>\u201cI wish Bob the very, very best,\u201d Klinsmann said Monday. \u201cI think it\u2019s a big, big moment having an American coach coaching a Premier League club. I think it\u2019s huge. And he\u2019s an awesome guy. He\u2019s a good person, and I just keep my fingers crossed for him.\u201d</p> <p>The match against New Zealand is USA\u2019s last run-out before they play Mexico in World Cup qualifying in November. The top three from the six-team qualifying \u201cHex\u201d advance to Russia by right, and the fourth-placed team faces a two-legged play-off against a team from Asia.</p> <p>Concacaf president Victor Montagliani suggested last week that the confederation\u2019s format be changed for future World Cups to allow more nations to play deeper into the four-year cycle.</p> <p>But Klinsmann opposed that idea, insisting that USA and other regional powers are hurt by fewer opportunities to face quality international opponents.</p> <p>\u201cIf we want to get better, we need to play with the best teams out there from South America or from Europe,\u201d Klinsmann said. \u201cWhat does that mean? For us it means, it would be the opposite direction.\u201d</p> <p>The New Zealand game comes a year and a day after Klinsmann\u2019s team lost to Mexico 3-2 in extra time in the playoff for a berth in the 2017 Confederations Cup.</p> <p>New Zealand lost to Mexico 2-1 on Saturday. Klinsmann said wished his team could have scheduled a friendly against stronger opposition, but Europe and South America had World Cup qualifiers scheduled and few teams were available.</p> <p>\u201cGhana wasn\u2019t allowed to come because they play one game in Europe and they\u2019re not allowed to play a second game in another continent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe go the list up and down.

  "<p>Supporters of Iran\u2019s national team have been asked to wear black and unite in religious chants rather than football songs during Tuesday afternoon\u2019s World Cup qualifying match against South Korea, after a row broke out over the game\u2019s clash with a day of mourning in the Shia calendar. </p> <p>Senior clerics from the holy city of Qom, home to prominent Shia Islam seminaries, and hardliners in Tehran had initially called for the match at the capital\u2019s majestic Azadi stadium to be postponed. </p> <p>The informal voluntary Basij militia and home-grown Hezbollah supporters have staged protests in Tehran and other major cities, threatening to confront fans.

Everyone has to be covered in black and the crowd should chant Ya Hussein. Instead of clapping hands, everyone has to chant Ya Hussein,\u201d Movahedi-Kermani said. <br></p> <p>Media reports say riot police have been deployed near the stadium. </p> <p>Ashura, which occurs on the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram, marks the death of the prophet Muhammad\u2019s grandson, Hussein ibn Ali, at the battle of Karbala, which is in present-day Iraq, in AD680. It is a significant occasion for Shia Muslims across the world, who wear black during the whole month and participate in street ceremonies that involve mourning, beating their chests and slapping their heads. <br></p> <p>The commemorations are widely observed in Iran and not just by those sympathetic to the ruling establishment \u2013 some younger people who may not practise the religion during the rest of the year also take part. For many, it is a chance to prepare food to donate or participate in what has increasingly become like a huge carnival. <br></p> <p>Iran\u2019s religious state has often exploited Ashura, with the authorities using the commemorations to spread their own message. Iranian leaders evoke Ashura as the main driving force behind the concept of martyrdom and resistance. The state also often sees itself as a defender of oppressed nations and frames regional conflicts, such as in Palestine, Syria or Iraq, in a religious context. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e942257d2fdc203e79d4b58d1dddf397f81d3dd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e942257d2fdc203e79d4b58d1dddf397f81d3dd7/0_112_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashura ceremonies in the city of Khorramabad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashura ceremonies in the city of Khorramabad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The controversy over Tuesday\u2019s match was so great that the country\u2019s supreme national security council had to step in to soothe concerns.

  "<p>It feels fitting that I first meet Issa Rae in a corridor: a long, empty, beige-carpeted limbo upstairs in a Los Angeles hotel. An early episode of her cult web series, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mia51fMAGJw&amp;list=PL019D7AE1C3429770\">The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl</a>, hinged on just such micro-anxieties \u2013 with Rae fretting over office etiquette as a vague acquaintance approaches her down a hallway. \u201cI\u2019ve already said hi to this woman,\u201d she thinks. \u201cWhat other interaction could we possibly have? What am I supposed to do with my face? Am I supposed to look at her the whole time? Do I act like the blank walls are interesting enough to stare at?\u201d </p> <p>To add to the awkwardness, Rae is half an hour late and the room turns out to be locked. The introduction is, well, awkward. Flustered apologies aside, though, Rae is no longer the awkward black girl, at least not in the same way. She\u2019s now a TV star in waiting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/07/insecure-review-hbo-issa-rae\">Insecure</a>, her new HBO series, is one of the most anticipated of the year. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, she looks amazing. In contrast to her dressed-down screen persona, she\u2019s wearing glasses, heels, full makeup and a black, embroidered designer dress. Her hair, dyed bright orange, is practically a work of sculpture. The awkwardness is still there, she admits, once we\u2019re inside: \u201cThat will never go anywhere. It\u2019s just a matter of finessing that within myself, trying to mask it.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise that she\u2019s a big fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/larry-david\">Larry David</a>, the master of social excruciation. \u201cHe\u2019s so unapologetically him,\u201d she says, \u201ceven if it\u2019s a terrible him.

Her character \u2013 Issa \u2013 is a smart but fallible woman trying to figure out why she hasn\u2019t got it all figured out. She\u2019s the sole black employee of a non-profit that \u201chelps kids from the hood but didn\u2019t hire anyone from the hood\u201d. Her boyfriend is an underachieving couch potato. Her best friend Molly is a high-flying lawyer with her own dating troubles. Issa\u2019s spontaneous decision to rap at an open-mic night about Molly\u2019s \u201cbroken pussy\u201d doesn\u2019t help.<br></p> <p>Rapping is something Rae\u2019s characters often do \u2013 hilariously badly \u2013 usually into the bathroom mirror. Sample lyric: \u201cDo you want your man or not? / Do you know your plans or not? / You gonna go back home or not? / You gonna claim your throne or not? / Is you Khaleesi \u2026 or \u2026 that other bitch \u2026 I don\u2019t remember.\u201d It\u2019s a great comic device but, sadly, it\u2019s not something Rae does in real life. \u201cA lot of my ideas come in the bathroom, though,\u201d she says. </p> <p>The fact that most of Insecure\u2019s characters are African-American should not be remarkable in 21st-century television, but it is. It\u2019s also hugely refreshing. Insecure deals with everyday life \u2013 love, work, friendship, going out, messing up \u2013 and it reveals the subtle racial markers hidden within these interactions. When Issa takes the initiative at work, she discovers everyone else is talking about her behind her back. \u201cThey\u2019re having secret white meetings and they\u2019re sending secret white emails!\u201d she complains. Raising it would make her look over-sensitive, though.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3564e9ee28ef0def55edb2f7abc7969fe3ef6fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3564e9ee28ef0def55edb2f7abc7969fe3ef6fc/0_155_3156_1894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"We got yall \u2026 Issa is the sole black employee of a non-profit that \u2018helps kids from the hood but didn\u2019t hire anyone from the hood\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We got y\u2019all \u2026 Issa is the sole black employee of a non-profit that \u2018helps kids from the hood but didn\u2019t hire anyone from the hood\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Marie Fox/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Issa\u2019s friend Molly, by contrast, is at ease in any situation. \u201cWhite people looooove Molly,\u201d Rae narrates, as Molly cracks up a boardroom of white executives. \u201cBlack people also looooove Molly,\u201d she continues, as Molly slams down dominoes with the security guards. Later, Molly advises a new black intern to tone down her loud behaviour. \u201cGirl, you know how these white people are,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you wanna be successful here, you got to know when to switch it up a little bit.\u201d<br></p> <p>Race, I suggest, adds an extra layer of awkwardness to that Larry David social minefield. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she replies. \u201cI love that: social minefield.\u201d She turns the words around in her head. \u201cGood phrase.\u201d<br></p> <p>It\u2019s a minefield for white people, too. They stumble over themselves trying to say the right thing in Issa\u2019s company, when they\u2019re not asking her to translate black slang, or being inadvertently patronising. For some white viewers, the show could be a gentle primer in How Not To Be Racist. \u201cWe\u2019re all going through it,\u201d says Rae. \u201cIt\u2019s just that one side is at more of a disadvantage. And nothing will happen unless we address it. I don\u2019t know the proper metaphor, but do you dig up mines? How do you deactivate mines?\u201d</p> <p>Rae has a similar minefield to negotiate \u2013 fail to acknowledge race issues and you\u2019re accused of selling out to white audiences; focus on them too much and you\u2019re no longer \u201crelatable\u201d. Larry David never had to think about \u201cswitching it up\u201d. Rae must be constantly mindful of it, especially now she\u2019s in the big league. Does it bother her? \u201cOnly when it confines you to a certain space. That\u2019s when it\u2019s irritating, almost insulting. It\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019re a black comedian so you\u2019re great among the blacks, but this canon you\u2019ll never touch.\u2019 I\u2019m more than black. Being black isn\u2019t an insult, it\u2019s a privilege, and something I\u2019m proud of, but it\u2019s when it\u2019s used to diminish your talents or your accomplishments that it gets frustrating.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At school in Dakar, she felt 'black'. At school in America, she felt 'too white'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rae was always something of a misfit. Her mother is from Louisiana, her father, a doctor, from Senegal. She mainly grew up in south Los Angeles, punctuated by two years in Dakar, and flitted between predominantly white private schools, where she felt conspicuously \u201cblack\u201d; and predominantly African-American state schools, where she was mocked for being \u201ctoo white\u201d. She later went to Stanford University in California, majoring in African and African-American studies, but also participating in drama and theatre, which led to her making her own lo-fi mockumentaries.</p> <p>Awkward Black Girl, which began in 2011, was a response to \u201cthe mainstream media portrayal of what blackness is\u201d. The transition from independent internet operator to part of mainstream media has brought new challenges. \u201cI\u2019m a very impatient, impulsive person,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m very used to like, \u2018Oh, I have an idea, let me write it, post it real quick, it\u2019s out there, the audience loves it or hates it.\u2019 Insecure has been been a three-year journey from pitch to screen. I\u2019ve been just like, \u2018Aaargh! I want to get it out there!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Now Rae is part of a generation of black women who are broadening that narrow band of the media spectrum, just when it\u2019s most needed. Her comedy reassures us that awkwardness, humiliation, bad judgment and saying dumb things you didn\u2019t really mean to are qualities that unite us all. She\u2019s levelling the minefield. </p> <p><em>\u2022 Insecure is on Sky Atlantic, Tuesday, 10.45pm and on HBO in the US, Sunday, 10.30pm.</em></p>",

But with the existing border control system under extreme stress, checks or visas for 100 million EU arrivals each year will mean a vast increase in workload for a Border Force that is already overstretched. Here\u2019s just one practical reality that makes Brexit look more shocking by the day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/10/brexit-plan-divide-britain-ireland-uk-border\">This Brexit plan will divide Britain and Ireland once more | Diarmaid Ferriter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/23/theresa-may-home-secretary-government-migration-target-fail-likely\">missed all her targets</a> when she was in charge of immigration as home secretary, so she knows better than anyone the impossibility of cutting net migration down to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/theresa-may-drops-migration-target-deadline-after-mocking-corbyn-in-pmqs\">tens of thousands</a>\u201d.

The new home secretary, Amber Rudd, went to Heathrow in July to see how her Border Force performs. She might have expected our biggest port to be the best run, and on her visit she saw all the desks fully manned, with minimal queues at passport control and plenty of smiles.</p> <p>What she probably wasn\u2019t told was how many of those desks were staffed by people pulled in from everywhere else, including HMRC tax officers from Newcastle, who were put up in hotels. (Can HMRC spare them, when they are only <a href=\"%EB%BC%8A\">checking 4%</a> of self-assessment tax forms?)</p> <p>Had she asked staff about their workloads, they probably wouldn\u2019t have told the truth, governed as they are by a regime of terror and targets. I spoke to some Border Force staff, on condition of strictest anonymity, meeting them miles away from Heathrow for fear of disciplinary action if they were caught talking to a journalist. With no culture of transparency, this service punishes whistleblowers.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what they told me: after the public row over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/09/heathrow-passport-queues-london-olympics\">gigantic queues</a> before the 2012 Olympics, strict targets were set: non-EU passengers must queue for no more than 45 minutes, EU for 25 minutes, and fast-track first class just 15 minutes. These targets must be met 95% of the time.</p> <p>At present, they are met 70% of the time, and staff shortages mean that civil servants brought in from elsewhere get just a few days\u2019 training. \u201cAll they can do is a basic passport scan,\u201d say these whistleblowers. \u201cTraining and experience matter. We can feel whether something is wrong about who they say they are, where they\u2019ve been, for how long and how often. We notice their demeanour, their nerves.\u201d It takes experience to spot children being trafficked. E-gates detect fewer suspicious cases.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/05/the-message-of-brexit-was-mixed-now-we-are-told-it-was-simply-a-referendum-on-immigration\">The message of Brexit was mixed. Now we are told it was simply a referendum on immigration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If members of the public complain about long queues with too few passport desks open, staff issue a reply from a printed sheet they\u2019re given: \u201cAll available Border Force officers are currently deployed and working to protect the public; border security remains our number one priority.\u201d An honest reply would go something like this: \u201cWe haven\u2019t got enough staff, we\u2019ve had cuts, we\u2019re on our knees working all hours and still missing our targets. Many more passengers are coming through and we don\u2019t have time to scrutinise them. Sorry. Did you vote for these cuts?\u201d</p> <p>With everyone manning the desks, paperwork piles up behind the scenes: asylum claims are rising again and people stopped can wait hours to be checked. Staff are taken off customs: \u201cGuns and drugs don\u2019t matter as much as queues,\u201d one officer says. They sometimes fail to claim the \u00a32,000 fines from airlines that bring people in with inadequate documentation because they miss a five-day deadline for claims.</p> <p>Staff hired now are on new contracts, with flexible annualised hours so they can be made to work overtime, extra days or to cancel holidays at short notice, \u201ca nightmare for parents with childcare\u201d, I was told. As a result, there is high turnover. \u201cWe\u2019re at least 300 short,\u201d these officers reckon. Managers deny it \u2013 but fixed official quotas of staff have been abolished.</p> <p>Visa checks on people from non-EU countries are weaker, they claim, now visa offices abroad have been closed. \u201cThere are no standard interviews for student or visitor visas now. But you can\u2019t rely on written references and qualifications,\u201d says one officer who has worked overseas. \u201cYou need to see applicants to detect people who are not what they say they are.\u201d During the present \u201csurge\u201d, there is only one forgery specialist each shift, instead of two or three: \u201cThey\u2019re run off their feet.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just staff grumbling: the rightwing, anti-public sector Adam Smith Institute <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/news/britains-beleaguered-border-force-stretched-to-breaking-point\">reported last month</a> that the Border Force is \u201cstarved of funds and neglected\u201d. Responsible for screening 225 million passengers a year arriving in the UK, it claims about 4,000 \u201chigh-risk\u201d flights are landing without proper security checks.</p> <p>Passenger numbers have risen by 20% since 2010 and are set to continue rising by 2% a year, while Border Force funding is cut: spending per passenger is down 25%. Some technology is 14 years out of date, while \u00a31bn was wasted on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/03/flaws-in-home-office-security-forcing-staff-to-rely-on-incomplete-intelligence\">failed e-borders system</a>. Last year\u2019s National Audit Office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/03/flaws-in-home-office-security-forcing-staff-to-rely-on-incomplete-intelligence\">report</a> warned that the Advance Passenger Information System was collecting only 86% of arrivals. The system cannot check them all \u201cin sufficient time to prevent high-risk travellers from starting their journey to or from the UK,\u201d the report said. That leaves 16.5 million people a year unchecked before arrival.</p> <p>Brexit will bring far worse problems. Half of all arrivals are from the EU, currently waved through on a scan to check their identity. But plans afoot at the Home Office suggest EU migrants will need to prove they have a skilled job lined up and can speak English. \u201cWe would need to check all these jobs were genuine \u2013 very difficult and very time-consuming,\u201d says one officer. It might require doubling the Border Force.</p> <p>\u201cTake back control\u201d was a brilliant play on people\u2019s fears. What the people swayed by it and everyone else should know is that controlling our post-Brexit borders will be phenomenally expensive and difficult. And how closed the UK is going to feel to our neighbours.</p>"
