  "<p>White, male and better-off graduates continue to dominate the professional classes more than three years after leaving university, even after quality of qualifications and other factors are taken into account, according to data compiled from universities in England.</p> <p>The study by the <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/\">Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> (Hefce) found that professional employment rates of students graduating in 2011 were as much as nine percentage points lower for black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani graduates than for white graduates.</p> <p>The analysis found smaller but persistent gaps between male and female graduates, with 79% of men in professional occupations or study, compared with 74% of women, even though more women were in jobs overall.</p> <p>Substantial gaps were also seen among graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds compared with those from better-off areas, suggesting that an effort to widen access to professional occupations such as law and accounting still has a long way to go.</p> <p>The single minority ethnic group that saw its prospects brighten was that of ethnic Chinese graduates, whose professional employment rates improved compared with a similar survey in 2009, and whose 2011 cohort enjoyed employment rates similar to those of their white peers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/nov/23/most-senior-judges-top-qcs-still-privately-educated-figures-show\">Most senior judges and top QCs still privately educated, figures show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prof Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education watchdog, said the Hefce report \u201chighlights the shocking gaps in outcomes for various groups of students \u2026 We know that students from most black and minority ethnic groups and those from disadvantaged areas face [the] worst outcomes,\u201d Ebdon said. \u201cThis remains the case even when accounting for factors such as entry qualifications, which might affect your future prospects.\u201d</p> <p>Forty months after graduation, the total proportion of graduates who were employed or in further study was more than 95%, and for both cohorts 69% were in white-collar professional roles.</p> <p>While the differences in overall employment rates between white graduates and those from minority groups narrowed between 2009 and 2011, the gaps in rates of professional employment did not improve. </p> <p>Hefce\u2019s analysis also made predictions of professional employment based on qualifications, and found that black and ethnic Pakistani graduates had the biggest gap between forecast employment rates and outcome.</p> <p>\u201cThe report supports previous Hefce analysis in demonstrating that there continues to be serious challenges to achieving equality of outcomes for graduates from ethnic minority groups, graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds and women, particularly in terms of securing professional employment,\u201d said Christopher Millward, Hefce\u2019s director of policy.</p> <p>\u201cHigher education can be a powerful force for social mobility but this requires not just access to and success within university. It also requires successful transition into rewarding careers. This report demonstrates the imperative for higher education providers to work with employers to address this.\u201d</p> <p>Hefce\u2019s new report updates previous analysis by examining the employment outcomes of UK-based students who qualified from a full-time first degree course at an English university in 2011. </p> <p>Ebdon said universities were trying to address what he described as \u201cunexplained outcomes gaps,\u201d with universities pledged to use \u00a355m from tuition fee income next year to support disadvantaged students for life after graduation.</p> <p>\u201cUniversities, government and employers should continue to work together to tackle these problems,\u201d Ebdon said.</p>",
  "<p>Away from the poppy Afrobeats of Nigeria and Ghana comes another breakout star of African dance music: the lugubrious, sensual house of Nathi Maphumulo, AKA Black Coffee. For years, the 40-year-old has been building a reputation with his DJ sets around the globe and BET award-winning productions, all of which are executed with one hand following a traffic accident as a teenager. We spoke to him ahead of one of his biggest UK dates so far, at the <a href=\"http://www.southwestfour.com/\">South West Four festival</a> on bank holiday weekend.</p> <h2>You grew up in the 1980s in Umlazi, a township in apartheid South Africa. What was life like back then?</h2> <p>A township is a place strategically built by the South African government to put black people, and make sure they don\u2019t amount to anything. Everything was limited. Townships were far away from the city, and coming to the city cost you money, but that was where the resources were. The hardest thing to do was leave and find opportunities, so kids get caught up in the township, where there\u2019s nothing to aspire to be. The people who did well were people who stole for a living. They were the most stylish, and they were the people you\u2019d look up to. They were the people who were having a bit of fun with their lives. So it was a far-fetched dream for me to come out and find a platform. It took so much desire, and being aggressive with that desire. I wasn\u2019t willing to let it go.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osQUJTBGCMs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/osQUJTBGCMs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Black Coffee: Come With Me \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Where did you start making music?</h2> <p>Everywhere. I saw every place as an institution. I was involved with the school choir. There was an after-school club for kids interested in doing music \u2013 I was first in line. I went to study at university, and I was still involved in groups. I was studying jazz, but I did a classical music play on the side. There was a music production studio, where I literally lived. Any opportunity to avail myself, I didn\u2019t hold back.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/31/black-coffee-favourite-tracks\">Black Coffee\u2019s favourite tracks</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>In 1990, you were involved in an accident in which you lost the use of your left hand. What happened?</h2> <p>It was the morning when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/11/nelson-mandela-release-disaster\">Nelson Mandela</a> was coming out of jail and, obviously, given our history, there were celebrations in all the townships. The idea was to sing around the streets, gather more people, go to the stadium across from our house and camp there until the morning until he came out and we could see him on TV. A car came out of nowhere and drove straight through the crowd at high speed: 35 people got injured; two people, including the driver, died \u2013 people set him on fire on the spot. </p> <p>The injuries bothered me a lot: how am I now going to be able to play records? How am I even going to be able to take them out of the covers? It was one of my nightmares. The nerves of my arm got severely damaged, and there was nothing anyone could do but wait for the nerves to grow back. We tried doing physiotherapy twice a week. I was hoping for a miracle, and I realised it was not going to happen. Mentally, I shut down that part of my life, and concentrated on my dream to be a musician. I didn\u2019t feel sorry for myself, I didn\u2019t think \u201cplease come tie my shoes for me, please come wash me, please come put this shirt on\u201d. I just started finding ways of doing things. My first car was a manual, but I drove it. I never stopped. Everything I wanted to do, I went for it.</p> <p>It took a lot of time to learn to DJ again \u2013 I\u2019d spend a couple of hours after school just playing. It took a lot of time to get to the level of playing I\u2019m on now. I knew one day I would find an opportunity, but I wanted that opportunity to find me ready. I had no residency, hardly any gigs, but I collected records with the little I could afford, and kept on practising.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmZ2PylqQhM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AmZ2PylqQhM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Black Coffee: We Are One \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>How did you discover house?</h2> <p>At first, my cousin and his friends would DJ. They used to do birthday parties. He was also my neighbour, and on Sundays, coming back from parties, he\u2019d connect the soundsystem in his room. Soon I started doing mixtapes for myself, trying to beatmatch the music, choosing songs I knew that, tempo-wise, were close together. But at the time there wasn\u2019t very much house. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/22/soul-2-soul-review-koko-london\">Soul II Soul</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/05/earth-wind-and-fire-review-liverpool-arena\">Earth Wind and Fire</a>, Snap, Technotronic \u2026 We used to call it \u201cinternational\u201d music. It was just danceable. This was before we started doing our own house music, called kwaito.</p> <h2>How did you start building up your reputation?</h2> <p>I couldn\u2019t afford to study any more, and I decided to leave school. A friend of mine had a record store and they were like: if you want a job, you can come help, teach people how to DJ, and sell records. The money was not good, but it opened my mind. Then I decided: this is holding me back. I now had no income at all, but I wanted to focus on my album. I made ends meet somehow. Singles came out, I started opening for people, and making a bit of money. If you establish yourself as a DJ, you don\u2019t need an album \u2013 you just need to be as good as your last gig.</p> <h2>You\u2019ve come a long way since then \u2013 your <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63WGt_FYPeI&amp;list=RD63WGt_FYPeI#t=140\">Africa Rising concert </a>featured an entire orchestra. What made you want to do that?</h2> <p>House music is more than just an underground thing. You can dress it up and expose it to a black-tie market, but still keep the essence of it. That show, I could take it anywhere \u2013 I could take it to Vegas. House music is misunderstood, and I\u2019d like to see it beyond the level it is in South Africa, where it\u2019s still just an undercurrent.</p> <h2>Why are more South Africans getting turned on to house music?</h2> <p>We come from a very musical place; almost everyone here can sing. Even in rioting \u2013 we don\u2019t shout and talk when we\u2019re rioting, we sing, we dance. South Africa wasn\u2019t the most pleasant place for black people, and song played a very big role in liberating the country. Some artists were banned on radio, others had to change their lyrics. One of the biggest artists back in the day was Chicco, and he released a song called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9boGnIeKPc\">We Miss You Manelo</a>, where Manelo meant Mandela. But house music was an escape. There\u2019s not a big minimal techno scene here; soulful, vocal house songs become big, not because someone has marketed them so well, but because people just connect with them.</p> <h2>If house is an escape, what are today\u2019s South Africans wanting to escape from?</h2> <p>The racial problems are still there, underlying. Some blacks are still angry [with apartheid]; some whites are angry that black people are in power now. The black powers are trying to do the best they can with the freedom we fought for, but not everyone is happy. So the old white political parties come back and say: \u201cYou see? We told you that you can\u2019t do this on your own. You need us.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of corruption, too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaFfMt362cc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qaFfMt362cc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Black Coffee: behind Pieces of Me - video</figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Your own tracks are definitely soulful, but there\u2019s a melancholic mood to many of them. Where does that stem from?</h2> <p>I can\u2019t explain it. I have a palette inside me, of music, and it\u2019s just a reflection of that. Even when I try to get out of it, and start differently, in the end I always end up there. Even if I collaborate with someone else, it ends up there. It\u2019s the most weird thing. I can\u2019t even take credit for it. The most recent album I released was called <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaFfMt362cc\">Pieces of Me</a> \u2013 it\u2019s me, in different styles. But you still think: this is a Black Coffee song. Every time I sit down to make one, I get taken to the same place.</p> <ul> <li>Pieces of Me is released worldwide on 26 August by Ultra Music. Black Coffee plays <a href=\"http://www.southwestfour.com/tickets\">South West Four</a>, London, on 28 August.<br></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Summer is no friend to makeup, which is liberating or boring depending where you stand. If you want excitement then salvation comes via one of the two trends which are ostensibly wintry but have become fixtures this season: dark lips and red eyes. The logic is plain \u2013 you haven\u2019t got anything else on your face so you can go mad with eyeshadow and lips. Probably not both though. Here is an argument for each:</p> <h2>Red eyes</h2> <p>Kristen Stewart is contractually obliged to work with red: blood or via Lucia Pica\u2019s make-up collection for Chanel, fronted by Stewart. It is part tomato, part goth but (crucially) shifts red from nails and lips to eyes. \u201cI love red, as did <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/08/chanel-in-paris-lagerfeld-revisits-coco-fashion-week\">Coco Chanel</a>, and it\u2019s the colour your face goes naturally when you flush,\u201d says Pica in a convincing three-point argument for the colour. The real key is eye colour. Stewart\u2019s are green and the red highlights that, although the same could be said for dark brown. Curiously, red sort of wakes eyes up, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d15484ad947d7c42ef1a0240ff89949dd5448e59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d15484ad947d7c42ef1a0240ff89949dd5448e59/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Candice from GBBO and Miu Miu makeup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candice from GBBO and Miu Miu makeup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: BBC/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dark lips</h2> <p>Think of your face like a print. \u201cIt\u2019s all about contradictions,\u201d said Dior\u2019s makeup director, Peter Philips, about the label\u2019s autumn/winter 2016 dark-lipped look. It either means contradict your palette (colour-wise) or buck the season by wearing dark shades (like Tom Ford\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/tom-ford-jasmine-rouge-lip-color_450-3001058-TOT32/\">Jasmine</a>) to the seaside. This is like dipping your toes in emo, noncommittally, because it\u2019s Wednesday and, well, YOLO and so on. The catwalk isn\u2019t always a convincing platform for trends, but Candice from the Great British Bake Off might sway you with her iris-dark lips which sound weird but somehow aren\u2019t.</p> <h2><br></h2>"
