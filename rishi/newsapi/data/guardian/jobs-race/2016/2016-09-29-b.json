  "<p>Gymnast Simone Biles stood tall at the White House on Thursday \u2013 though not quite as tall as first lady Michelle Obama.</p> <p>The 19-year-old Olympian found herself being playfully used as an arm rest by 5ft 11in Michelle at a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/theoval/2016/09/29/obama-invites-black-power-protesters-white-house-olympic-ceremony/91275198/\">ceremony</a> honouring the 2016 US summer Olympic and Paralympic teams.</p> <p>\u201cOnly one American woman has ever won gold on the vault,\u201d Barack Obama said. \u201cOnly one American has won four golds in gymnastics in a single Games. That would be this young lady, Simone Biles.\u201d</p> <p>The event was attended by relatives of Jesse Owens and America\u2019s 17 other black athletes from the 1936 Olympics for the acknowledgement they, unlike their white counterparts, did not receive from Franklin Roosevelt 80 years ago. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no kid in America\u200b\u200b who can\u2019t look at our Olympic team and see themselves somewhere</p> <footer> <cite>Barack Obama</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sprinter Allyson Felix, the only female track and field athlete to win six golds, told reporters afterwards: \u201cIt\u2019s been just so moving, so inspiring.

Felix reflected: \u201cWe\u2019re inspired by what they did. It was a peaceful protest and it brought so much attention.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially with everything that\u2019s happening now, as athletes we do have a voice and we want to show that change should happen, so we want to use your voice for that in a peaceful way because we still are so proud to represent this country.\u201d</p> <p>Obama praised the diversity of the 2016 Olympic team, which ranked first in the medal table with 46 golds.

  "<p>Legal papers filed by the New York police department reveal that the department sent its own undercover officers to protests led by Black Lives Matter after the death of Eric Garner. The NYPD documents also show that it collected multimedia records about the protests.</p> <p>The NYPD disclosed its undercover operations in response to a group of New York attorneys requesting records under the state freedom of information law. The department has thus far declined to provide the records requested. But its descriptions in August court filings of the records it is refusing to release provide new details about its monitoring of protests at Grand Central Station:</p> <ul> <li>The first set contains \u201cmultimedia records\u201d relating to the petitioners\u2019 request for \u201cpictures, videos, audio recordings, data, and metadata\u201d collected or received by the NYPD at the Grand Central Station protests, which Black Lives Matter groups are<a href=\"http://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/black-lives-matter-protesters-rally-second-consecutive-day-flood-grand\"> still leading</a>, according to the NYPD response.</li> <li>The second \u201cconsists entirely of communications between and among NYPD undercover officers and their handlers\u201d, pertaining to the protests. According to a 22 August NYPD Memorandum of Law, these undercover communications \u201cconsist primarily of immediate impressions concerning ongoing events\u201d.</li> <li>The third \u201cconsists of a single record, which is a communication from an NYPD officer working in an undercover capacity and his base\u201d, pertaining to the protests, the response indicates.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9bb4541bee9f42440f57467555fe36ac44582271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bb4541bee9f42440f57467555fe36ac44582271/0_0_447_498/447.png\" alt=\"blm nypd\" width=\"447\" height=\"498\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the images transit police released in response to the same group\u2019s records request about Black Lives Matter surveillance last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Screenshot from Freedom of Information request</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The revelations come from the same records request that led to the Intercept\u2019s<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/18/undercover-police-spied-on-ny-black-lives-matter/\"> release</a> of documents last summer showing that MTA and Metro-North transit police had regularly spied on Black Lives Matter protesters in and around Grand Central, deploying <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-black-lives-matter-surveillance_us_55d609a1e4b055a6dab3407a\">plainclothes</a> officers to monitor demonstrations, track their movements, and share photos of activists. Though some NYPD officials appeared to<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2287875-mta-blm-in-conjunction-w-nypd.html\"> be linked</a> to the monitoring, those documents did not confirm whether the NYPD itself was leading its own surveillance operation targeting activists.</p> <p>The attorneys litigating for the records say the NYPD\u2019s newly revealed operations are potential constitutional violations, especially since released MTA and Metro-North police observations of these protests frequently stated that the gatherings were<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/18/undercover-police-spied-on-ny-black-lives-matter/\"> \u201cpeaceful\u201d and \u201corderly\u201d.</a></p> <p>\u201cThe fear and disarming effect caused by undercovers being assigned to what were and continue to be extraordinarily peaceful protests is disturbing,\u201d said MJ Williams, one of the attorneys involved in the records request. \u201cTo the extent that it would influence individuals not to participate and get individuals to censor what they say because of a fear of undercovers \u2013 that\u2019s a basis for a first amendment violation.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cAs someone who was present at the protests, it\u2019s disturbing to know the NYPD may have a file on me, ready to be used or to prevent me from getting a job simply because I\u2019ve been active in some political capacity. That\u2019s potentially a fourth amendment violation for unlawful seizure, but on the other hand, we\u2019ve seen law enforcement agencies have all sorts of justifications for data collection for public safety that the courts have allowed.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the Freedom of Information Law request, John Donohue, the second highest ranking uniformed officer in the NYPD\u2019s intelligence bureau, argued in an affidavit that the NYPD could not release the records because public understanding of the undercover operations could help \u201cwould-be criminals\u201d learn \u201cthe circumstances in which the NYPD does not, or cannot, deploy undercover officers\u201d. The release of the \u201cmultimedia\u201d records of the protests, Donohue said, also could reveal \u201cthe kinds of optical technology NYPD uses, both in its undercover and general surveillance operations\u201d and \u201cany areas NYPD does not have under surveillance, thereby exposing gaps in coverage\u201d.</p> <p>The MTA and Metro-North disclosures from last summer revealed that transit police tracked activists\u2019 locations and shared images of some activists, like Jose La Salle, an organizer with the New York police watchdog group Copwatch Patrol Unit, and Alex Seel, a movement photographer.</p> <p>If similar multimedia images are being held by the NYPD, they<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-black-lives-matter-surveillance_us_55d609a1e4b055a6dab3407a\"> could be</a> a violation of the NYPD\u2019s protest monitoring rules, known as the Handschu<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-black-lives-matter-surveillance_us_55d609a1e4b055a6dab3407a\"> guidelines</a>, which are supposed to prevent the department from<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/enemies-within-by-matt-apuzzo-and-adam-goldman-2013-9\"> deploying undercovers</a> or<a href=\"http://www.nyclu.org/news/face-of-lawsuit-nypd-ends-routine-videotaping-of-protestors\"> collecting images of protesters</a> solely to keep tabs on their political activity.</p> <p>Martin Stolar, an attorney<a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/a-never-ending-lawsuit-turns-40/\"> who helped bring</a> about the Handschu guidelines in 1971, said it isn\u2019t clear if the NYPD violated the guidelines since we do not know if the monitoring is part of an authorized ongoing investigation. In an email to the Guardian, Stolar explained, the NYPD is \u201cunlikely to tell you, or anyone, whether an investigation is ongoing or not and authorized or not\u201d.<br></p> <p>The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>In recent years the NYPD has been criticized for alleged spying on political and ethnic groups without substantial evidence of criminal activity. New York City\u2019s independent police monitor released a report in<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/63e2d09bfbfb47b9a045357609ac9bc2/inspector-general-nypd-skirted-rules-surveillance\"> August</a>, concluding that between 2010 and 2015 the department routinely violated legal requirements in its monitoring of Muslim communities, failing to explain<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-broke-rules-probing-muslim-groups-inspector-general-article-1.2762445\"> its use</a> of undercovers and informants and<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/63e2d09bfbfb47b9a045357609ac9bc2/inspector-general-nypd-skirted-rules-surveillance\"> extending</a> investigations without evidence of criminal activity.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Black Lives Matter activists in New York have pointed to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeeganNYC/status/771814261169459200\">apparent sightings</a> of undercover NYPD officers at protests and claim that the surveillance is ongoing.</p> <p>\u201cThis is still happening, we still have undercovers at our protests weekly,\u201d said Armie Jeffreys, an organizer with NYC Shut It Down and Millions March. \u201cBut we\u2019re still out here. They can try if they want to, but it\u2019s not gonna stop us.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Some years ago I found a lump in my right breast. In the week between tests and diagnosis I prepared a contingency plan, not for me but for my clients. My intuition told me this was cancer and, if so, I would need to stop working with immediate effect.</p> <p>The day after the diagnosis I agreed with my then employer a hand-over plan, and what I would tell clients. Therapists are encouraged not to disclose information about themselves to clients. Personal boundaries are essential to avoid anything that might distort and take away from the story of the other, who is seeking support.</p> <p>Over the next days I met all my clients informing them this would be our last session, and what was in place for the continuation of the counselling. I started each session with the same statement: \u201cI have had some news, which means I will no longer be able to continue seeing you or any of my clients.\u201d</p> <p>There was a common assumption that I had found something better, another job, been promoted; and disappointment that I did not honour my duty of care and finish the work we had started.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jul/25/kate-granger-campaign-inspired-nhs-compassionate-doctor\">Kate Granger inspired all of us in the NHS to be more compassionate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, I had found something else and, yes, I would not stay on. I felt the hurt I had caused and we talked about it, how it might repeat past experiences and expectations of rejection, but I chose not to disclose more. I did not want to cause concern about me. But instead it appeared I had torn into existing wounds.</p> <p>I left the two GP practices where I had been working without telling the practice staff why. I thought I was protecting my clients and did not want them to find out the real reason from a third party. I felt like a thief at night with an unsavoury secret.</p> <p>A key support in my life was my own therapist. Three months into my cancer treatment I received an email telling me that due to health reasons, there would be no more sessions until further notice. Would I like to be put in touch with someone else? No, that would not do. I was shocked and worried for my therapist.</p> <p>My cancer treatment continued and was increasingly debilitating \u2013 physically, mentally, emotionally. Doubts started to set in about everything in my life, including my therapist. Perhaps dealing with my cancer had been too much. Perhaps I was too much. Part of me knew it was not really like this. I had trusted this person with my life story for years; but the nagging remained.</p> <p>Some months later, at the start of a new year, between my chemotherapy and radiotherapy, an email arrived with my therapist\u2019s name in the subject heading. The email had been sent to all current and former clients. My therapist was dead. No more explanations. We were invited to get in touch with a named contact if we needed support with what had happened.</p> <p>I was distraught and angry. I wanted to know what had happened. Initially, the request for further information was turned down. Eventually, I got the news I had expected: cancer.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what it would have been like had I known the diagnosis while I was going through my own cancer treatment. Perhaps my therapist had been trying to protect me. Perhaps they had been too ill to do anything different. I would not have been in a fit enough state to converse with clients while I was undergoing my treatment.</p> <p>But, on balance, I wish I had been told. The not knowing and fear of abandonment was tormenting. Telling me would have taken away that uncertainty and stress. The truth would have frightened me, for sure. But if I had been told calmly, that may have also calmed and steadied me at a time of my own crisis and uncertainty over life and death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/views-from-the-nhs-frontline/2016/mar/07/junior-doctor-patients-dont-know-i-have-cancer\">Junior doctor: my patients don't know I have cancer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are all complex situations and assumptions, and I do not doubt for a second that my therapist did their best and acted responsibly, just as I did with my clients.</p> <p>Life\u2019s experiences shape us.

She had told police he was sick and not acting like himself. </p> <p>\u201cI just called for help, and you came and killed him,\u201d she shrieked. </p> <p>Also on Wednesday, Richard Gonsalves, who is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/police-shooting-black-man-san-diego-officer-sexual-harassment\">subject of sexual harassment complaints</a> by a fellow officer, was identified as one of the officers involved in the shooting. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/police-shooting-black-man-san-diego-officer-sexual-harassment\">Officer in fatal California shooting of black man sued for sexual harassment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gonsalves was demoted last year from sergeant to officer after a colleague, Christine Greer, alleged that he repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances and even texted her a photo of his penis. <br></p> <p> Greer filed a lawsuit against Gonsalves and the city, which was settled. But she filed another one in August, saying that she has faced retaliation from Gonsalves.</p> <p>Dozens of people have peacefully protested against the shooting since Tuesday, with demonstrators gathering outside the El Cajon police headquarters on Wednesday, chanting \u201cno killer cops\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter\u201d. After dark, about 150 people marched down wide avenues near the shooting scene yelling: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police!\u201d </p> <p>The fatal shooting happened less than two weeks after black men were shot and killed by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, where violent protests broke out. </p> <p>During a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, the mayor of El Cajon, Bill Wells, said that he was concerned that it took police an hour to respond to the report of the mentally unstable person and that victim was shot dead a minute after officers arrived.</p> <p>Police say the man refused to comply with instructions to remove a hand from his pants pocket, paced back and forth, then rapidly drew an object from the pocket, placed both hands together and extended them in a \u201cshooting stance\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> The two officers simultaneously fired a handgun and an electric stun gun. </p> <p>Some protesters said Olango was shot while his hands were raised in the air, though police disputed that and produced a single frame from a witness\u2019s cellphone video to support their account. </p> <p>The image showed the man in what police called a \u201cshooting stance\u201d. His hands were clasped together and he was pointing directly at an officer who had assumed a similar posture a few feet away. That officer fired his handgun and a second officer, farther away, simultaneously fired his electric stun gun, Chief Jeff Davis said. </p> <p>The single photo is all police released depicting the incident that sparked protests by demonstrators demanding more information and wanting to know how police could shoot an unarmed man. Olango\u2019s family demanded the full video be released, Gilleon said. <br></p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re cherry-picking part of the video,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is exactly what police have said is unfair when only portions of video are released against them.\u201d </p> <p>Agnes Hassan, originally from Sudan, said she had spent time in a refugee camp with Olango. She said they both suffered to get the United States and described Olango as well-educated but mentally ill.<br></p> <p>His sister had called police on Tuesday afternoon and said he was acting erratically.</p> <p>One officer fired a Taser and the other shot Olango several times. Police later said Olango was unarmed. </p> <p>Christopher Rice-Wilson, associated director of the civil rights group Alliance San Diego, questioned why one of the officers felt non-lethal force was appropriate while the other did not. </p>",

That suit was settled. Both suits allege that the city was told about Gonsalves\u2019s behavior but failed to act to stop him. </p> <p>The August complaint was filed supplementally against Gonsalves and also against the city of El Cajon for failure to prevent Gonsalves\u2019s harassment and for retaliation Greer experienced after the first suit. The second suit also alleges that Gonsalves did all of this despite knowing that Greer was \u201ca sexual assault survivor who suffered from PTSD\u201d.</p> <p>According to court documents, Olango came to the US from Uganda with his family as refugees in 1991, when he was 12. The family then settled in California.<br></p> <p>Agnes Hassan, a refugee from Sudan, told reporters that she and Olango had been in a refugee camp together. \u201cWe suffered so much with the war in Africa, we come here to suffer again,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Both the El Cajon police department and the El Cajon police officers\u2019 association, the police union, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>"
