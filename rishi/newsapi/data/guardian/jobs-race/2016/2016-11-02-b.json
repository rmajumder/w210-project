  "<p>A white nationalist has apologized for robocalls in Utah calling independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin a \u201ccloset homosexual\u201d.</p> <p>William Daniel Johnson is a Los Angeles-based lawyer and self-described white nationalist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/donald-trump-white-nationalist-delegate-database-error\">originally meant to be a delegate for Donald Trump</a> at the Republican national convention.</p> <p>On Monday, Johnson announced that he was putting out an automated call to Utah voters attacking McMullin, an independent conservative candidate who has become the <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/19/independent-presidential-candidate-evan-mcmullin-leads-in-utah--new-poll.html\">unexpected frontrunner</a> in the heavily Mormon state, according to recent polls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/evan-mcmullin-independent-presidential-candidate-trump\">Evan McMullin on his presidential bid: 'Someone needed to step up' to Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy name is William Johnson. I am a farmer and a white nationalist,\u201d the robocalls said. \u201cI make this call against Evan McMullin and in support of Donald Trump. Evan McMullin is an open borders, amnesty supporter.</p> <p>\u201cEvan has two mommies. His mother is a lesbian, married to another woman. Evan is okay with that. Indeed Evan supports the supreme court ruling legalizing gay marriage,\u201d it continued. \u201cEvan is over 40 years old and is not married and doesn\u2019t even have a girlfriend.\u201d </p> <p>The call concluded: \u201cI believe Evan is a closet homosexual. Don\u2019t vote for Evan McMullin. Vote for Donald Trump. He will respect all women and be a president we can all be proud of.\u201d</p> <p>In an email to reporters Wednesday, Johnson said that he had disabled the robocalls and would not be sending them elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cI am sorry for the mean-spirited message and I humbly retract its contents,\u201d Johnson said. </p> <p>\u201cI sent the robocalls out because Utah is a strong family-values state and America and the west is gripped by an extreme and fatal malady: failure to marry and have children. The white birth rate is so astonishingly low that western civilization will soon cease to exist. I felt that Evan McMullin typified that perfidious mentality.\u201d</p> <p>He said that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign had repudiated his robocall, and added that \u201cmany people from Utah and beyond have excoriated me for it as well.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cJust as Donald Trump has issued a heart-felt apology for his past locker room talk, I too issue a heartfelt apology for this robocall. I should not have sent out. I am truly sorry,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian what had led to the change of heart, Johnson said he \u201c received ten or more emails and telephone calls from Utah voters who told me that I should not be so mean-spirited\u201d.<br></p> <p>A spokesperson for the McMullin campaign did not respond to requests for comment. </p>",
  "<p>Well, you\u2019ve got to give Tony Abbott\u2019s supporters their dues for loyalty, I suppose.

If the PM gives into Abbott by promoting his disloyalty, what next?), little serious consideration has been given to whether the member for Warringah is actually credentialed to do the job.</p> <p>Well, he ain\u2019t.</p> <p>Abbott, despite his soft press in this space, is no renaissance politician when it comes to Indigenous matters, despite having assiduously cultivated a media reputation as one with a deep understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, society and history.</p> <p>In fact he has demonstrated little more than a particularly narrow, somewhat Anglophile and imperial approach to Indigenous Australia \u2013 one more akin, really, to the views of the early-to-mid-20th century assimilationist anthropologists and mission vicars who raced to \u201cpreserve\u201d material culture and \u201csave souls\u201d while they charted what they felt certain was the vanishment of the race.</p> <p>As the so-called, self-appointed \u201cprime minister for Indigenous affairs\u201d, Abbott was hopeless and offensive.</p> <p>He surrounded himself with a predictable coterie of Indigenous men and women, to the exclusion of others with challenging views that did not prioritise economic development and punitive, racially based welfare \u201creform\u201d above the preservation of living culture and genuine self-determination.</p> <p>As PM for Indigenous affairs, Abbott began with a vow to sweat blood to achieve constitutional recognition for Indigenous people. Never mind that \u201cRecognise\u201d is largely the tame, mostly whitefella politicians\u2019 response, the \u201clook over here\u201d distraction, to the far more pressing need for treaties and meaningful truth and conciliation processes.</p> <p>(That\u2019s the imperial, Anglophile, Abbott I mentioned earlier.)</p> <p>Then came his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/04/australia-unsettled-before-the-british-came-tony-abbott-knows-better\">ridiculous assertion in mid-2014</a>, that: \u201cI guess our country owes its existence to a form of foreign investment by the British government in the then unsettled or, um, scarcely settled, great southern land.\u201d</p> <p>I guess that\u2019d be why colonial \u201csettlers\u201d, soldiers, militias and others saw fit to kill, by some accounts, up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/15/why-the-number-of-indigenous-deaths-in-the-frontier-wars-matters\">60,000 Indigenous people</a> on the um, \u201cunsettled\u201d, Queensland colonial and immediate post-federation frontier, alone. Never mind the rest of the continent. </p> <p>Abbott would soon compound his habitation fallacy with this insult to Indigenous Australians: \u201cThe arrival of the first fleet was the defining moment in the history of this continent.

Should he rise to become Indigenous affairs minister, I can recommend Abbott some fine books, not least <a href=\"http://hardiegrant.com.au/publishing/bookfinder/book/1787-by-nick-brodie/9781743791608\">Nick Brodie\u2019s recently published 1787</a>, that illustrate the many, many important moments of continental history that preceded invasion in 1788. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/22/indigenous-australians-know-were-the-oldest-living-culture-its-in-our-dreamtime\">Indigenous Australians know we're the oldest living culture \u2013 it's in our Dreamtime | Larissa Behrendt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oh yeah, then there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/10/remote-communities-are-lifestyle-choices-says-tony-abbott\">\u201clifestyle choices\u201d rant</a> \u2013 an explanation of his impatience with public subsidy of remote communities (never mind the addiction of successive governments to middle-class welfare and rural subsidies). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/11/lifestyle-choices-is-abbotts-third-and-final-strike-on-indigenous-affairs\">I wrote at the time about Abbott\u2019s three strikes</a> on Indigenous issues; he\u2019s done nothing since to make amends. </p> <p>Was that it for Abbott, the Indigenous affairs PM?</p> <p>No, unfortunately \u2013 there\u2019s more. Far more. Let\u2019s not forget that Abbott made his first mark in the Indigenous space by <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-13/budget-2014:-$534-cut-to-indigenous-programs-and-health/5451144\">cutting $500m plus from Indigenous programs</a> in the 2014 federal budget (while pledging more millions to Recognise). Then he set off on a staged-managed visit to Arnhem Land to demonstrate his purported Aboriginal bonafides to a bemused Yolngu who, like the rest of Indigenous Australians, are still waiting for anything substantive to materialise.</p> <p>Nigel Scullion, the incumbent Indigenous affairs minister, is a journeyman, devoid of lateral ideas and cultural insight, with a tin ear for creative advice.</p> <p>Indigenous Australia deserves far, far better.</p> <p>And far, far better, still, than the restless, bruised former prime minister for Indigenous affairs.</p>",

There remains scope for the Yorkshireman to end the year with the European Order of Merit prize which so narrowly eluded him 12 months ago, though by Willett\u2019s own admission the scaling of heights even close to what transpired at Augusta National in April is proving tricky.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/nov/02/jordan-spieth-slump-ewan-murray\">Jordan Spieth \u2018slump\u2019 says as much about rivals\u2019 strength as his own woes | Ewan Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A third <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/chris-wood-danny-willett-pga-championship-wentworth\" title=\"\">at the BMW PGA Championship</a> and his runners-up finish at the Italian Open stand out as Willett\u2019s only strong results since The Masters. Last week at the WGC-HSBC Champions, he closed at an aggregate of 14-over par. His Ryder Cup, in his own words and partly linked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/28/darren-clarke-pj-willett-ryder-cup-article-us-fans\" title=\"\">the unhelpful antics of his brother</a>, was \u201cshit\u201d.</p> <p>Somehow, Willett is seeking to summon the spirit of Augusta. The Turkish Airlines Open, starting on Thursday, is the second of four tournaments in succession for Willett to conclude the season. For now he lies second in the Race to Dubai behind Henrik Stenson, who is not in this week\u2019s field.</p> <p>\u201cThe last couple of months have been poor, to be honest, in a lot of aspects,\u201d Willett admitted on Wednesday. \u201cLast year I missed out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/22/rory-mcilroy-world-tour-championship-race-to-dubai\" title=\"\">in the Race to Dubai to Rory</a>. He played great in Dubai, the final one. I think I had to just beat him and it would have been mine but he finished first and I finished fourth.</p> <p>\u201cThis year I\u2019d been leading it for a long, long time. Unfortunately last week I had probably my worst event on tour for all the years I\u2019ve been on, and Henrik finished second, so jumped me. For me, this is a pretty big week. Henrik is not here \u2013 he was never scheduled to play anyway. So it gives me a chance to either close that gap, or hopefully leapfrog again and make it really interesting coming down to the last two [events].</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can. The game is average; it has been average for a couple of months, so we\u2019re working hard and we\u2019re trying to do the right things. Unfortunately you have highs and lows in golf and the last couple of months have been a bit of a low. Before that was a massive high. You just keep working hard, and if you do that, then it\u2019s only around the corner.\u201d</p> <p>If the fresh levels of attention and time constraints that came with being a major champion were the most problematic aspects for Willett, that would be perfectly understandable. Yet that does not actually seem to be the case. Rather, the 29-year-old\u2019s desire to further his game after winning that first major is the key factor.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to get better and better,\u201d Willett said. \u201cFor me, April has been a pretty magical month but you still try and push your game forward and push your game on. At times that leads to taking a few steps backwards in trying to change things that you\u2019re doing and unfortunately it\u2019s just been a bit of a stale run. It\u2019s happened at a really bad time of year.</p> <p>\u201cThe focus isn\u2019t on the short-term goal \u2013 it\u2019s a long-term goal, and you\u2019ve got to start making changes eventually and doing something different if you want to get better. Everyone\u2019s getting better every week. Just because I won in April doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s going to continue for ever. You\u2019ve got to make sure you keep on top of things and that you keep trying to get better. Just at the minute it\u2019s just a little bit stale.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working incredibly hard in the gym, off the golf course, doing everything right and practising hard. It\u2019s just not quite going the way that I would have envisioned it going these last couple of months. I\u2019m pretty sure that I work with two of the best coaches in the world in Mike Walker and Pete Cowen. I\u2019ve got a very good team around me and we\u2019re trying to do everything correct and I\u2019m pretty sure that everything we\u2019re doing is correct.\u201d</p> <p>Willett was joined for pre-tournament duties here by Lee Westwood, who became the latest player to shrug off security concerns relating to an event in Turkey. Several have opted to skip this tournament with such fears in mind. Westwood answered \u201cyes, a little bit\u201d when asked whether he had been disappointed by withdrawal levels. \u201cI think the world we live in right now, anything can happen anywhere,\u201d he added. \u201cI think Turkey is no different to anywhere else.</p> <p>\u201cI think everybody has to be very vigilant about these things but I certainly have no security worries about coming to Turkey. You [the media] are here, so you obviously aren\u2019t going to do it if you have fears and I\u2019m no different to you. I value my life as much as you value yours. I\u2019m here looking forward to playing golf this week and in a big tournament, and we\u2019re focusing on that. I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p><em>Ewan Murray travelled courtesy of Turkish Airlines</em></p>",
  "<p>I am sad to record the death of Lionel Morrison, aged 81, a tireless activist for the National Union of Journalists and for the cause of black people.</p> <p>I am unsure whether he was the first black journalist in Fleet Street, but I cannot recall another who worked for a national popular newspaper in the early 1970s. </p> <p>He was certainly the NUJ\u2019s first black president, having been elected to the post in 1987, and worked hard for the union for more than 40 years. </p> <p>I think Seamus Dooley, the NUJ\u2019s assistant general secretary, summed up his character well in noting that he <a href=\"https://www.nuj.org.uk/news/nuj-pays-tribute-to-lionel-morris/\">\u201cmade a remarkable impression on all who met him\u201d</a>.</p> <p>He sure did. Quiet, persistent and patient, he preferred to argue his case one-to-one, face-to-face rather than ranting from the microphone. </p> <p>I had met him several times before I knew anything of his background in South Africa, where he was born in 1935.</p> <p>At 21, he was the youngest of the 155 people to face the court in the infamous treason trial that resulted in the jailing of Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu.<br></p> <p>Morrison, who had previously spent five months in Johannesburg\u2019s notorious prison, The Fort, for his opposition to apartheid, was acquitted.</p> <p>While working as a reporter for the Golden City Post, South Africa\u2019s first black weekly, he helped to found the South African National Union of Journalists, a non-racial organisation in contrast to the whites-only South African Society of Journalists.</p> <p>Following the 1960 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpeville_massacre\">Sharpeville massacre</a>, he went into exile. He spent time in Europe, Asia and Africa, helping to found the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, before beginning to look for work in Britain in 1968.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/lionel-morrison-journey-sa-prison-nuj-president\">an interview in The Voice</a> a couple of years ago, he said he wrote to nearly 100 newspaper and magazine editors without success. Few agreed to see him, and he believed he was rejected because of the colour of his skin. </p> <p>Interviews came and went until he met Bob Edwards, editor of The People, who took him on, initially to cover a story about the Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill. It ended up with the paper being sued, but Morrison was praised by the judge for his work and the way he gave his evidence.</p> <p>He went on to work, as both reporter and subeditor, at the London Evening Standard, Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Mirror. </p> <p>During the 1970s, I recall his sensible, non-confrontational contributions to debates at NUJ London branch meetings. And in 1974, at the delegate meeting in Wexford, Ireland, members agreed to set up a race relations working party with Morrison as its first chair. </p> <p>Significantly, a year later, the union agreed to incorporate into its code of conduct the requirement that members should not \u201coriginate material which encourages discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, gender or sexual orientation\u201d.</p> <p>In 1977, Morrison put himself forward for the NUJ presidency, later claiming that he lost out because of \u201cbloody racism\u201d. Ten years later, however, he was elected as president and spent his year addressing inequality in the media and in the NUJ.</p> <p>Later, he played a key role in establishing the <a href=\"https://www.nuj.org.uk/rights/george-viner-memorial-fund/\">George Viner Memorial Fund</a>, a charity trust that aids black journalism students, helping to address the problem of there being a disproportionately low number of black journalists working in the UK.</p> <p>Morrison went on to work for the Commission for Racial Equality. As he told The Voice\u2019s interviewer: \u201cWhen things are wrong, you have got to do something about it\u201d.</p> <p>In a tribute to Morrison, Michelle Stanistreet, the NUJ\u2019s general secretary, spoke of his enormous impact on the union and \u201chis passion and commitment to journalism and to social justice and equality\u201d. </p> <p>And Jim Boumelha, who was to become the second black president of the NUJ, said: \u201cHe will be remembered for the countless struggles he led... [He was] a passionate and eloquent voice for the cause of justice\u201d.</p> <p>The NUJ is planning to publish a fuller appreciation of Morrison in a few days. </p>",

  "<p>January feels like a long time ago. During the month, in the lead-up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sundance-2016\">Sundance</a> and the Oscars, there was a constant stream of articles about #OscarsSoWhite and the fact that for the second year in a row there were no actors of color nominated for the main awards. Step forward Nate Parker and his passion project The Birth of a Nation, a film that took him seven years to make and is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/12/hollywood-truth-better-fiction-birth-of-nation-nat-turner\">a far from historically accurate portrayal</a> of the rebel slave Nat Turner. It quickly became an award winner and a record setter when it was bought by Fox Searchlight for $17.5m. Amid the five-star reviews and the fever that surrounded the film \u2013 including a standing ovation before it had even been screened \u2013 it seemed this film would solve the problems. It wouldn\u2019t.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/15/its-impossible-to-be-vulnerable-how-moonlight-reflects-being-a-black-gay-man-in-the-us\">\u2018It\u2019s impossible to be vulnerable\u2019: how Moonlight reflects being a black gay man in the US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At Sundance, it was the toast of the festival, serving as a convenient palate cleanser to take away the bad taste that #OscarsSoWhite had brought to the event.

But when the revelations about Parker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/30/nate-parker-birth-of-a-nation-rape-allegation-60-minutes-interview\">rape case from 1999</a> began to be reported, suddenly supporters stepped away from the film and reviews at the time of its release became lukewarm at best. It was no longer the buzzy Oscar contender it had been in January. Now it was a hubristic cautionary tale about what happens when guilt drives critical faculties.<br></p> <p>These films serve a purpose for Hollywood, and the reception The Birth of a Nation received pulls that into sharp focus. There\u2019s the same complacency and eye-rolling undercurrent to some of the coverage accompanying Barry Jenkins\u2019 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/03/moonlight-review-devastating-drama-is-vital-portrait-of-black-gay-masculinity-in-america\">Moonlight</a>.

It\u2019s a film that has triggered some of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/30/magazine/black-male-sexuality-last-taboo.html?_r=0&amp;smid=pl-share\">the best cultural writing this year</a> (as well as some of the aforementioned worst), brought a world few have ever seen on the big screen to the forefront, and is well on its way to becoming the <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/10/moonlight-gimme-danger-oasis-weekend-specialty-box-office-1201845224/\">most successful independent film of the year</a>. If it doesn\u2019t get Oscar nominations, there will be outcry, but if it does there\u2019s the potential that it will become <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/10/28/moonlight-is-the-black-film-hollywood-desperately-needs/\">this year\u2019s <em>black film</em></a>: a useful example for critics of the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag to hold up as evidence of how far the industry has come in only 12 months. Indeed, for some, Moonlight has clearly filled that inconvenient hole as the one black film that needs to be in the running. All this while films by or starring Asian or Hispanic talent are nowhere to be found in the race.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/19/the-great-awards-whitewash-diversity-loses-out-on-the-red-carpets\">Oscars whitewash: why have 2015's red carpets been so overwhelmingly white?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, there\u2019s been an incredible run of movies produced by directors and actors of color. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/29/the-13th-review-ava-duvernay-new-york-film-festival-prisons-plantations-race-law-us\">Ava DuVernay\u2019s 13th</a> eloquently laid bare the racism at the heart of the US prison system; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/27/fences-trailer-denzel-washington-viola-davis\">Fences</a> will bring August Wilson\u2019s Pulitzer-winning play to the big screen; while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/loving-review-civil-rights-tale-marries-heartfelt-drama-with-too-much-restraint\">Loving</a> tells the story of mixed-race marriage and those states which opposed it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/15/hidden-figures-trailer-octavia-spencer-janelle-monae\">Hidden Figures</a> shines light on a forgotten story from the Space Race era, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/19/oj-simpson-made-in-america-espn-documentary\">OJ: Made in America</a> reminded everyone about who OJ Simpson was (and what made him that way), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck\">I\u2019m Not Your Negro</a> gives James Baldwin some of the attention he deserves.

  "<p>In a 20-year career, I\u2019ve jumped ship a few times. Sometimes it\u2019s for good reasons (a cabin upgrade), sometimes for not such good reasons (the captain\u2019s acting like he\u2019s been at the rum rations).</p> <p>However, while you can know what you\u2019re leaving, it is almost impossible to know what you\u2019re joining. Committing yourself to a school you don\u2019t know much about is a big gamble and, come September, you don\u2019t want to look down and discover that you\u2019ve just bought a return ticket for the Titanic. Believe me, I know that feeling.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/jan/10/five-alternative-careers-for-teachers\">Five alternative careers for teachers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On one memorable occasion, two days into a new post, I found myself around the conference table with seven senior leadership team colleagues. Within five minutes it was clear that the only voice that would be heard was the head\u2019s; our job was to sit and nod as the interminable monologue rolled itself out like a one-act, modernist play. </p> <p>There is hope, however. Following some hideous experiences, I have learned a thing or two about spotting dysfunctional organisations. Take heart: this is far less complex than it sounds as, in reality, there is only one type of dysfunctional organisation \u2013 all the others are mutations of the same virus.</p> <h2>The diagnosis</h2> <p>On visiting a prospective employer, I now look for small details that are likely to be symptoms of a toxic working environment. The greater the number of symptoms, the more likely my diagnosis is accurate. </p> <p>Start with a school\u2019s website, building, playground, lobby and correspondence. They can tell you a lot about how it functions \u2013 after all, these features constitute the public face of the institution and, if you are planning to look at that face on a daily basis, it should be well scrutinised. </p> <p>Look for signs of twitching, uncontrollable gurning or the blank, thousand-yard stare of corporate culture. If the overall impression is chaotic or cold, it is likely this is how you will feel working there.</p> <p>Standing outside a playground and analysing the type of noise generated by it can also be useful as it can tell you about the quality of behaviour and social interaction that is acceptable in the school. If the games seem dangerous and the adults are shouting, you can draw some easy conclusions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/oct/23/fact-or-fiction-the-reasons-teachers-choose-the-job-and-quit\">Fact or fiction? The reasons teachers choose the job \u2013 and quit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spending 10 minutes in the school\u2019s reception area can also provide clues as to how adults and children deal with each other once inside. It is also worth noting how adults relate to each other, especially school management. If you don\u2019t feel any warmth, pay very close attention to any other interactions you come across as you take the pre-application tour.<br></p> <p>On any walkabout, you will get good opportunities to see how \u201cthe suits\u201d deal with the school staff and pupils. On one such visit I made, it was clear that there was absolutely no rapport between the headteacher and the children \u2013 we walked and talked as the children passed by like dull weather. The only exchange initiated by the adult was a reprimand about school uniform. </p> <p>On entering a classroom with this head, the poor teacher\u2019s face adopted a look that I last saw in Evil Dead II: a spasm of horror that slumped back into ground-down despair. This told me as much as I needed to know about communication, culture and, more precisely, who the school had been set up to serve. If the sole purpose of a school is to anoint the ego of the headteacher, there is no need to inform anyone else of a walk round with a prospective employee.</p> <p>These are the schools where you will find that reduced teaching hours are a signifier of importance and increased teaching hours are a punishment. If you are ambitious and not interested in your profession, this is perfect for you.<br></p> <h2>Downton divide</h2> <p>In these non-collaborative environments, you are also likely to hear the word \u201cstaff\u201d used in a way reminiscent of Maggie Smith in Downton Abbey, and there will be an equally clear divide between upstairs and downstairs. Such a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach will ensure that any stakeholder consultation, including those undertaken with \u201cstaff\u201d, will be viewed with disdain. This cannot fail to lead to an exploitative culture. In such an environment, you are likely to end up working with those who value data over humanity. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/jun/04/job-hunting-tips-teachers-how-to-ace-presentation\">Job hunting tips for teachers: how to ace the presentation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also likely that you will be treated as a Job Description whose aim is to Add Value to the business by having Structured Conversations with another Job Description. If you are really lucky and do exactly what the policies tell you to, you could fast-track your way to having no contact with children whatsoever.<br></p> <p>Unsurprisingly, these cultures are more common in larger schools and multi-academy trusts because posturing grandeur is laughable when placed on the small stage. However, the size of the organisation is only one indicator of possible dysfunction. Others to look out for are: an excess of logos, Xeroxed classroom environments, joyless or fearful pupils, a general lack of character and an abundance of personnel who conduct themselves with clipped efficiency or a corporate swagger in the Clarkson vein. If you are a creative or intellectual type, avoid these schools at all costs \u2013 they will destroy you. </p> <p><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

  "<h2><strong>The Missing </strong><br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>A drama as befuddling as Harry and Jack Williams\u2019s story of a kidnapped girl returned to her parents needs to be anchored by performances of quiet, still strength. It\u2019s got them, with Keeley Hawes superb again tonight as a mother shattered by grief and confusion. Even in an episode that exists in the sad aftermath of last week\u2019s explosive ending, the twin timelines and mass of concealed info still make us feel like we\u2019re spinning helplessly in the dark. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>Unarmed Black Man </strong><br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>William Chapman, a teenager from Virginia, was one of 306 black men killed by US police in 2015. Unusually, Chapman\u2019s death resulted not merely in the dismissal from the force of the (white) officer involved, Stephen Rankin, but in murder charges. James Jones\u2019s fascinating film sees Rankin\u2019s trial from both sides and attempts to do the same for the issue it highlights, an effort wretchedly unlikely to become redundant any time soon. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2><strong>Television\u2019s Opening Night: How the Box Was Born </strong><br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>On 2 November 1936, the BBC first broadcast to the nation. The medium was more significant than the message: the content was a brief variety show and, in any case, hardly anyone had a TV at this point. This cheerful film sees a team led by Dallas Campbell and Professor Danielle George attempting to reconstruct that broadcast using approximations of the original equipment. Hardly an essential mission but it\u2019s fun to see boffins at play and eventually, oddly touching to see this quixotic enterprise reach fruition. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>My Trans American Road Trip </strong><br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Abigail Austen made headlines in 2007 as the first British army officer to transition from male from female, but she\u2019s now more frequently found on the other side of the fence as a reporter for C4\u2019s Unreported World. In this important documentary, she investigates why trans rights have been a major talking point in the run-up to the US election, looking at everything from conditions in the military to laws around public bathrooms. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><br>This Time Next Year<br>8pm, ITV</h2> <p>In this concept-heavy new show, Davina McCall cocks her head to the side and listens while members of the public confide in her a deeply personal goal, be it losing weight, conceiving a child or finding love. Having filmed their interview a year ago, a \u201ctime-travel\u201d format shows them appearing through a Stars in Their Eyes-type door moments later having done what they set out to do, to the delight of a studio audience. From the Cilla/Rantzen school of touchy-feely telly. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Dropperz <br>8.30pm, ITV2</h2> <p>Hapless grime collective Dropperz aren\u2019t exactly at the top of their game as they struggle to get it together this one-off comedy mockumentary pilot. It\u2019s their last chance to film their video and find the fame they deserve, but with a dead rabbit and a guilty dog on their hands, it looks like they\u2019re about to be dropped from their record label. Promising fun with a talented and witty cast including Kiell Smith-Bynoe, Guz Khan, Letitia Hector and Alexis Caley. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Conviction <br>9pm, Sky Living</h2> <p>New series in which Hayley Atwell plays a rebellious former First Daughter, presented with a choice: work for a new legal outfit aiming to exonerate the wrongly convicted, or go to prison for cocaine offences. She chooses the former: let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s no more bizarre than anything going on in actual US politics right now. Tonight she works to overturn the case of a \u201cgood-looking black poster-boy\u201d imprisoned for murdering his high-school sweetheart. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>The Greatest</strong> (Shana Feste, 2009) 11.45pm, BBC1</p> <p>Carey Mulligan is sweetly compelling as Rose, a student grieving for her boyfriend (Aaron Johnson) who has died in a car crash after they made love for the first time. When she discovers she\u2019s pregnant, an awkward relationship with his parents (Susan Sarandon and Pierce Brosnan) develops. Feste\u2019s drama leaves many questions hanging, but is full of powerful performances. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Fracture</strong> (Gregory Hoblit, 2007) 1.25am, Channel 4</p> <p>Handsome-looking but daft legal thriller starring Anthony Hopkins as a brilliant aeronautical engineer who concocts the perfect murder, shooting his unfaithful wife (Embeth Davidtz) then running rings round young hotshot prosecutor Ryan Gosling in court. The implausibilities mount up alarmingly, but it\u2019s a highly polished piece of entertainment. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Tennis: The Paris Masters </strong>Coverage of the third day at the AccorHotels Arena in Paris.<strong> </strong>10am, Sky Sports 1</p> <p><strong>Champions League Football: Tottenham Hotspur v Bayer Leverkusen</strong> Bayer visit Spurs\u2019s temporary home at Wembley Stadium. 7pm, BT Sport 2</p> <p><strong>NBA: Boston Celtics v Chicago Bulls </strong>Coverage of the Eastern Conference clash direct from TD Garden. 12midnight, BT Sport 1</p>"
