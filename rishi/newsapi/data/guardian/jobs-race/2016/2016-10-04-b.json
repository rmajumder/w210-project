  "<p>If anyone ever doubted that black children are not treated equally in the classroom, the research released this year surely proved them wrong. In June, studies stated that black students are nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/08/us-education-survey-race-student-suspensions-absenteeism\">four times as likely to be suspended</a> as white students, and nearly twice as likely to be expelled. In September, we heard that black preschoolers are <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/310792/black-students-school-suspension/\">3.6 times</a> more likely to receive one or more out-of-school suspensions. </p> <p>And a few days ago, new <a href=\"http://ziglercenter.yale.edu/publications/Preschool%20Implicit%20Bias%20Policy%20Brief_final_9_26_276766_5379.pdf\">research</a> from the Yale Child Study Center finally pointed to clues as to why these disparities may exist: implicit bias.</p> <p>Implicit biases take the form of subtle, sometimes subconscious stereotypes held by white teachers, which had been shown to result in <a href=\"http://www.american.edu/spa/news/race-bias-in-teacher-expectations-03302016.cfm\">lower expectations and rates of gifted program referrals</a> for black students. Yale\u2019s study revealed these biases are directed at much younger children than previously thought, and are present in black and white teachers\u2019 behaviors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"19e00c5bf4a6fce45601747edda2664f71f92a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19e00c5bf4a6fce45601747edda2664f71f92a6e/0_0_333_575/290.png\" alt=\"Footage from the video shown to educators.\" width=\"290\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Footage from the video shown to educators.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Researchers led by Yale professor Walter Gilliam showed 135 educators videos of children in a classroom setting. Each video had a black boy and girl, and a white boy and girl. The teachers were told the following:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are interested in learning about how teachers detect challenging behavior in the classroom. Sometimes this involves seeing behavior before it becomes problematic. The video segments you are about to view are of preschoolers engaging in various activities. Some clips may or may not contain challenging behaviors. Your job is to press the enter key on the external keypad every time you see a behavior that could become a potential challenge.</p> </blockquote> <p>While the teachers were asked to detect \u201cchallenging behavior\u201d, no such behavior existed in any of the videos. Yet when asked which children required the most attention, 42% of the teachers identified the black boy.</p> <p>The participants\u2019 conscious appraisal of whom they believed required the most attention closely mirrored the independent results of an eye-tracking technology used by the research team, which noted that preschool teachers \u201cshow a tendency to more closely observe black students, and especially boys, when challenging behaviors are expected\u201d.</p> <p>Allison R Brown, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.ytfg.org/2015/07/communities-for-just-schools-fund/\">Communities for Just Schools Fund</a>, an organisation which seeks to combat the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/juvenile-justice/school-prison-pipeline\">school-to-prison pipeline</a>\u201d, found the report heartbreaking but not surprising. </p> <p>\u201cBlack bodies are policed in the streets and in the classroom \u2026 [Research] demonstrates that black boys are viewed as <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/03/black-boys-older.aspx\">four and five years older</a> than they are. Research demonstrates that racial disparities in school discipline exist in the most subjective of categories \u2013 \u201cwillful defiance\u201d, \u201cinsubordination\u201d, \u201cdisrespect\u201d. Those racial disparities decrease significantly for the most objective of categories: possession of alcohol on campus, possession of drugs with intent to distribute, possession of a loaded weapon.</p> <p>Brown worries that the study supports what headlines suggest to her: black people are seen as less than human, less deserving of dignity and respect. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Staff tend to observe more closely black boys when challenging behaviors are expected</p> <footer> <cite>Yale Child Study Center</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The study\u2019s findings suggested an underpinning of Brown\u2019s anxiety, but found that it wasn\u2019t limited to black people. Researchers noted that when teachers were also given information about the disruptive child\u2019s home life and family stressors, teachers only reacted more empathetically if the teacher and student were of the same race. Otherwise, teachers rated the students more severely. The report suspects this is because teachers felt powerless to improve the student\u2019s situation.</p> <p>\u201cThese findings suggest that teachers need support in understanding family struggles as they may relate to child behaviors, especially when the teacher and child are of different races,\u201d Gilliam, the lead researcher, said.</p> <p>The good news is that teachers are open and willing to do the work. Gilliam pointed out that when he gave study participants the opportunity to withdraw their data from the study, only one subject chose to do so.</p> <p>To solve this dilemma, Gilliam recommends anti-bias training programs, and suggests consulting the work done by Dr Howard Stevenson of the University of Pennsylvania on racial literacy and racial climate in schools.</p> <p>Lauren Owen, a white teacher and recent graduate of Harvard Graduate School of Education who wrote a compelling essay on the need for <a href=\"http://www.edutopia.org/blog/empathy-classroom-why-should-i-care-lauren-owen\">empathy in teaching</a>, says that \u201crace is a category (though a socially constructed one) that we can see, and thereby also in some ways easier to identify with. I think it\u2019s tough to get past visual indicators of sameness or different-ness because they are reinforced too frequently, and so it\u2019s easier to empathize when we have similar experiences with someone who looks the same as us.\u201d</p> <p>Gilliam offers reasons to be hopeful. He reminds us that educators, who are paid very little, pursue teaching because they love young children. To the parents of black children, he offers this advice: \u201cDon\u2019t wait until you are worried about whether biases may impact the relationship between your child and his or her teachers. Be proactive. Get to know your child\u2019s teachers, director and staff. In all of my years of studying this issue, I\u2019ve never seen a case where a child was expelled or suspended from a childcare or preschool setting when the parents and teachers knew and liked each other. Not once.\u201d<br></p>",

But within my first week, I had told every single one of my family members, friends, and a man I was dating that I wanted to go home. Not in nine months, but now. <br></p> <p>There were nights where I was ready to call quits on my budding humanitarian career for sheer frustration at the job, social setting, and \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 crushing disappointment of the whole ordeal. I wasn\u2019t meeting others deployed in the country, trips out to project sites were few and far between, and I found myself working long hours every day, mostly on my own.

The speech is meant to convince this incredulous person that although you are making sacrifices to be an aid worker, it is worth it. You never wanted to settle down anyway. </p> <p>I\u2019ve noticed that even after multiple deployments, as soon as I arrive in-country I repeat such a speech to myself. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019ve had a frustrating day of dodging red tape at the office, I haven\u2019t made friends as quickly as I\u2019d expected or I\u2019m missing loved ones back home. I\u2019ve found those days particularly numerous during my first month of any deployment, as I get my bearings. As a coping mechanism I use those same lines to convince myself that it\u2019s all worth it. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/02/secret-aid-worker-projectitis-dfid-civil-society\">Secret aid worker: the UK NGO sector is facing a funding crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I should admit to myself that on some days this choice to be an aid worker (one I have studied a number of years and endured many unpaid internships for) doesn\u2019t seem worth the sacrifice. I\u2019ve willingly chosen to work in some of the most difficult contexts in the world. But what happens when the work doesn\u2019t go as planned and you don\u2019t feel you are having the impact you should? <br></p> <p>In those dark times when I\u2019m struggling I don\u2019t admit there might be something wrong. Instead I play the game of rationalising. I tell myself that I\u2019m learning new skills by working in difficult \u2013 or near impossible \u2013 operational contexts; and that I\u2019m simply \u201cfocused on my career\u201d on those days I wish I was out with friends. We all do it, but why? Perhaps it\u2019s because surrendering to the unhappiness of those moments would lead us to questioning our entire lifestyle and choice of career \u2013 and that is too scary. </p> <p>As aid workers, we don\u2019t have any hesitation about spending hours complaining about X, Y, Z over one too many drinks. We commiserate together, we have deep philosophical conversations about whether or not humanitarian work is really having the impact on the world that we had hoped, but we never dare ask each other whether we are enjoying ourselves more than if we\u2019d opted for a more traditional career path. <br></p> <p>There is seemingly no space for such skepticism in this lifestyle. And I think that needs to change. Let\u2019s face it, there are some really great aspects of being an aid worker \u2013 I have met some amazing people, seen places in the world I otherwise would not have, and, yes, the work is fascinating and meaningful. But there are the bad days. Each deployment will have its own mix of each, and we can quickly forget those more negative periods of time and be hard on ourselves when we are finding the first month of a new deployment miserable. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/03/secret-aid-worker-regret-not-speaking-out-lgbt-colleagues\">Secret aid worker: I regret not speaking out for my LGBT colleagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So, today, when I have one of those moments \u2013 alone in a new place, wishing I was back home \u2013 I try to cut myself a break. I\u2019m allowed to not love this life all the time. It\u2019s alright to question whether I want to be here, and whether I\u2019ll still want to be an aid worker in 10 years. Despite the sales pitch for humanitarian work leading us to mistakenly believe that this job has to be worth it, it\u2019s alright to wonder whether I even enjoy humanitarian work. That feeling eventually passes. The whole process would be a whole lot smoother if I could just admit to myself that, yes, overall I do enjoy being an aid worker.

He saw dystopia at an earlier rally too, describing: \u201crace riots on our streets on a monthly basis. Somebody said don\u2019t call them race riots, but that\u2019s what they are.\u201d</li> <li>Hillary Clinton said that her opponent \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/clinton-trump-taxes-rigged-system\">represents the same rigged system that he claims he\u2019s going to change,</a>\u201d and painted him as a business failure. \u201c\u201cHow anyone can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is beyond me.\u201d A round of new polls showed Clinton ahead of Trump in several swing states off of the first presidential debate last week.

No evidence of this belief has been presented, however; it is nightmare speculation,\u201d Judge Richard Posner wrote in the <a href=\"http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2016/D10-03/C:16-1509:J:Posner:aut:T:fnOp:N:1838881:S:0\">opinion</a>.</p> <p>\u201c[Pence] provides no evidence that Syrian terrorists are posing as refugees or that Syrian refugees have ever committed acts of terrorism in the United States. Indeed, as far as can be determined from public sources, no Syrian refugees have been arrested or prosecuted for terrorist acts or attempts in the United States. And if Syrian refugees do pose a terrorist threat, implementation of the governor\u2019s policy would simply increase the risk of terrorism in whatever states Syrian refugees were shunted to.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump, Pence has taken the draconian position that the US should stop taking refugees from Syria because vetting processes are inadequate, in their eyes. A refugee who wants to come to the US must pass through interviews, background and medical checks by the Department of Homeland Security, US security agencies, immigration services and the UN, and the process takes 18 months to two years.</p> <p>Posner wrote that Pence\u2019s idea of exclusion by nationality is: \u201cthe equivalent of his saying (not that he does say) that he wants to forbid black people to settle in Indiana not because they\u2019re black but because he\u2019s afraid of them, and since race is therefore not his motive he isn\u2019t discriminating.

This year, the Trump Foundation made its most wide-ranging request for donations yet: It set up a public website, donaldtrumpforvets.com, to gather donations that Trump said would be passed on to veterans\u2019 groups.</p> <p>But the Trump Foundation never registered under article 7A of New York\u2019s Executive Law, as is required for any charity soliciting more than $25,000 a year from the public.

The president sat down with Jonathan Chait to discuss five key situations during his presidency: the Republicans, Obamacare, BP oil spill, Cuba and drones.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very in-depth chat with Obama, who delves into what sort of legacy he\u2019ll leave behind. Here he is on drone strikes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What I will say, though, is that the critique of drones has been important, because it has ensured that you don\u2019t have this institutional comfort and inertia with what looks like a pretty antiseptic way of disposing of enemies. I will say that what prompted a lot of the internal reforms we put in place had less to do with what the left or <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/donate-now?ea.tracking.id=ED2016EVSCgl&amp;gclid=CJuEsvCouM8CFQEkhgodwA4PCA\">Human Rights Watch</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amnestyusa.org/\">Amnesty International</a> or other organizations were saying and had more to do with me looking at sort of the way in which the number of drone strikes was going up and the routineness with which, early in my presidency, you were seeing both DOD and CIA and our intelligence teams think about this. And it troubled me, because I think you could see, over the horizon, a situation in which, without Congress showing much interest in restraining actions with authorizations that were written really broadly, you end up with a president who can carry on perpetual wars all over the world, and a lot of them covert, without any accountability or democratic debate.</p> <p>But I will say that having these nonprofits continue to question and protest ensured that, having made that initial decision, we kept on going and that it got pushed all the way through. And it\u2019s not \u2014 as I announced when we released our best estimates of the civilian casualties \u2014 it\u2019s not a perfect solution. I think America will continue to have work to do in finding this balance between not elevating every terrorist attack into a full-blown war but not either leaving ourselves exposed to attacks or, alternatively, pretending as if we can just take shots wherever we want, whenever we want, and not be answerable to anybody.

  "<p>The release of the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6354.0?OpenDocument\">latest job vacancy figures</a> were a mix of good and bad news. They highlight yet again how the fight to get work depends very much upon where you live, and that the fight for work is likely to continue to be easiest for those seeking to work part-time.</p> <p>In the August quarter, the number of job vacancies rose \u2013 up 2,200 to 175,300. This was the 12th consecutive quarter of the number increasing \u2013 one of the best runs ever seen since the ABS began collecting the data in May 1979. Only the 13 consecutive quarters of increasing job vacancies after the 1990 recession is longer.</p> <p>And while the total number of vacancies remains below the heights seen in 2011, it remains a very healthy number of jobs available for those looking for work:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job vacancies\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3OCKn/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Of course, total job vacancies by itself can be a bit misleading. That\u2019s why economists look at the \u201cjob vacancy rate\u201d \u2013 the number of vacancies as a percentage of the labour force:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job vacancy rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/U44nk/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>At 1.38%, the vacancy rate is also quite healthy, if perhaps not as healthy as you would expect it to be given the number of vacancies.</p> <p>And this is where the bad news starts.</p> <p>Economists look at the vacancy rate because there is a pretty good relationship between it and the unemployment rate. As a general rule, the higher the vacancy rate, the lower the unemployment rate \u2013 this is because if more businesses are looking for workers, it is easier for unemployed to find work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/20/sure-unemployment-is-down-but-plenty-of-people-would-like-to-work-more\">Sure, unemployment is down but plenty of people would like to work more | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a relationship that has held up quite well over the past 25 years in Australia. But right now given the relatively strong vacancy rate, you would expect the unemployment rate to be lower than it is \u2013 somewhere around 5.2%.</p> <p>In the past, with a vacancy rate of 1.38% or better, the unemployment rate has never been higher than 5.4%, yet right now it is 5.7%.</p> <p>That is a concern because it suggests that for some reason workers are finding it tougher to get work than in the past. This might be because the jobs are in places where the unemployed are not, or that the unemployed lack the skills required for the jobs that are available, or it might be that the type of work available is not enough to stop people looking for more work \u2013 ie because even though they have a part-time job they are still actively looking for work.</p> <p>One consequence of this is that currently there is slightly more unemployed per job vacancy than you would expect given the job vacancy rate:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job vacancy rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u25zL/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But even amid this there is still good news. The 4.1 unemployed per vacancy is the lowest since the end of 2012.</p> <p>That good news is tempered somewhat (as all good economic news must be) by the knowledge that job vacancies is a forward-looking indicator. A job vacancy this month often means a job for someone next month (or possibly later). So if job vacancies are growing then employment should also grow.</p> <p>The problem is, while the number of job vacancies is growing, it is doing so at a slower rate than before. This suggests that the current slowing in the growth of employment will likely continue:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Job vacancies and employment growth - annual\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qK6RP/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The breakdown of job vacancies in each state also shows the great differences in economic health across the nation.</p> <p>The growth of vacancies is strongest in New South Wales and Victoria, and weakest is in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland.</p> <p>In terms of fighting for work, the easiest state to be in is NSW, where there are just 3.4 unemployed for every job vacancy. This is just ahead of Victoria\u2019s 4.6:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Vacancies and unemployment by state\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/CXiLB/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia lag behind NSW and Victoria, the trajectories of the states are quite different.</p> <p>Where Western Australia and Queensland continue to suffer from the drop of mining investment, South Australia is seeing improved growth of vacancies and as a result looking for work in that state has become markedly easier. Two years ago there were over nine unemployed for each vacancy; now it is 6.55:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployed per private sector job vacancy\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IIOAW/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As usual, the most number of job vacancies are in the administration and support industry, closely followed by retail trade. Four of the top five industries with the most number of vacancies also have the highest percentage of part-time workers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Vacancies by industry\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RK8XY/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Given those industries over the past decade have become even more likely to employ workers part-time, it\u2019s little surprise that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/20/sure-unemployment-is-down-but-plenty-of-people-would-like-to-work-more\">underemployment levels are at record heights</a>. The jobs are there, but not so much the hours of work desired.</p> <p>The job vacancy figures are the classic glass half-full/half-empty. It\u2019s good that the number of vacancies continues to grow, but not good that the growth is slowing. It\u2019s good news if you are unemployed in NSW or Victoria; not so good if you live in WA or Queensland and are looking for work. And above all, while it\u2019s good there are jobs out there, it is less good if the work you want or need is full-time work.</p>"
