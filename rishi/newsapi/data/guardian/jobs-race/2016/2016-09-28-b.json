  "<p>The Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has promised to learn the lessons of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/sam-allardyce-return-football-management-england-exit-fa\">Sam Allardyce\u2019s 67</a> days in charge of England and is likely to introduce \u201ca lot more scrutiny\u201d of commercial arrangements for staff. Clarke also revealed the FA is conducting a review of its disciplinary processes that include looking at the rules around agents and transfers.</p> <p>Clarke, who along with the chief executive Martin Glenn mutually agreed to part company with Allardyce over an embarrassing newspaper sting, said he felt sympathy after they parted ways following a \u201cgrown up\u201d discussion.</p> <p>\u201cI sat down with him yesterday and said: \u2018Sam this is so foolish\u2019. He said: \u2018Yes, you\u2019re right\u2019. He created a lose-lose scenario where he lost the job of a lifetime and we lost an England manager who may have been pretty successful \u2013 he was doing a good job,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/28/england-manager-sam-allardyce-greed-fa\">Big Sam\u2019s big fall the product of a polluted atmosphere of greed | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI did feel sorry for him. I don\u2019t get any pleasure from seeing a human being in pain. And Sam was hurting. He was the cause of his own demise but I don\u2019t get any pleasure from that.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke, only appointed to the FA role in August, indicated it would clamp down on the rules surrounding commercial arrangements for all staff. \u201cWe are going through a lessons learned process. The lessons learned will be very important. Things like: should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/28/england-manager-sam-allardyce-greed-fa\">any business development opportunity,</a> even if it is in the opinion of the person involved non-conflicting, then should it be registered and reported to the FA?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have a shirt or a watch or a shoe sponsor there is no conflict there but it is a commercial transaction leveraging off your role as a senior official at the FA. I think we\u2019ll move towards a lot more scrutiny of the commercial arrangements.\u201d</p> <p>Allardyce, speaking for the first time since he lost his job over his comments to undercover reporters, said \u201centrapment had won\u201d but Clarke said he did not have a problem with the way the story came out.</p> <p>\u201cMy view of these things is that if you think there is actually something going on, go after it. If you hear something and you want to run it down, then run it down,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause transparency and a strong media is vital to our society.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was unable to comment on Allardyce\u2019s payoff, citing confidentiality clauses, but said the terms were reached following a \u201csensible discussion\u201d.</p> <p>Clarke reiterated the view of Glenn that it was important for FA staff, including the England manager, to be held to high standards. \u201cAppearances do matter. The image of the FA is important. If we have to dispense discipline and justice, we have to be credible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continually look at whether we\u2019re living up to our own standards. You can\u2019t tell people to do better if you have poor standards yourself. Organisational hypocrisy doesn\u2019t get you far.\u201d</p> <p>The disciplinary review, set in train by Glenn before Clarke\u2019s appointment, will involve discussions with the Premier League and the Football League as well as Fifa, Uefa, the government and the police over the best way to regulate issues surrounding transfers, money and agents. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about policing alleged transactions, it\u2019s about how we dispense justice around on and off the field disciplinary matters.\u201d</p> <p>He said the review would make proposals for various options that may lead to extra resources and extra powers. However, he said it had to be proportional. \u201cEveryone in football wants to deal with this issue but at the same time we don\u2019t want to be the Stasi.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f119b3dff9498c3cc6912aeef5870c8e14ed4f80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f119b3dff9498c3cc6912aeef5870c8e14ed4f80/627_89_1529_1911/800.jpg\" alt=\"Greg Clarke\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greg Clarke has promised to learn the lessons of Sam Allardyce\u2019s short reign as the England manager, including introducing greater scrutiny of commercial matters involving FA staff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clarke conceded that the issues around transfers were increasingly global in nature but said it was important to focus initially on what it could do in the short term in the England game.</p> <p>\u201cAll the problems of pan-geography legislation are insurmountable in the short to medium term. It\u2019s all long term. Getting the EU to do something or getting Fifa to do something is a long process because you have different statutory controls in different countries,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re trying to see what we in England can do better on our own without having to put together a global agreement. With the support of the government, the professional game, the national game, the police, what can we do that could make things better. It needs thought and it needs to be very clear about the problems we\u2019re trying to solve and what processes and powers we need to solve them.\u201d</p> <p>Questions have been asked over whether the FA should have appointed Allardycegiven the outstanding questions from the Quest review in 2006, which failed to clear three transfers in which he was involved while at Bolton. Allardyce strenuously denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>\u201cThe one thing I don\u2019t try to do is to second guess decisions made in good faith when I wasn\u2019t here,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf I had been part of the decision and understood the facts, I would take accountability. I have never run away from accountability. The guys did their best.\u201d</p> <p>In a joint statement with the Premier League and the EFL, the FA also responded to the allegations in the Telegraph that alleged eight current and former managers had been said to take bungs.</p> <p>\u201cAny substantive allegations will be investigated with the full force of the rules at our disposal, which are wide-ranging and well-developed. In addition, should we find any evidence of criminality we would inform and seek the support of the appropriate statutory authorities,\u201d it said.</p> <p>On the appointment of a new England manager, Clarke said he would not rule out waiting until the end of the season for the right candidate. The England Under-21 coach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/28/gareth-southgate-england-caretaker-manager-sam-allardyce\">Gareth Southgate, will take charge of the next four matches</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe will look at what have we learned from the Sam hiring process and how do we apply that to the next hiring process. The most important thing is we\u2019ve got Gareth focused on the next four games. That buys us time to really give some thought to how we do it this time round,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy view is that you need someone who really understands English football. That could be an English person or someone who has worked in England and managed at a senior level. But to parachute someone in who has never managed in this country would be a big ask.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It seemed too nice a place \u2013 houses too well kept, too many families out enjoying the late summer day \u2013 to have someone tell me my life was in imminent danger. But then again, I was a white outsider \u201cacting suspicious\u201d in Park West, an all-black Milwaukee neighborhood with a long history of being ostracized, humiliated and discriminated against by white people.</p> <p>Weeks earlier, in nearby Sherman Park, buildings had been set on fire after 23-year-old <a href=\"http://projects.jsonline.com/topics/sherman-park/index.html\">Sylville Smith</a> was killed by a police officer. </p> <p>As I walked down the residential block, I was approached by two young men whose voices tangled into one. \u201cYou got some balls coming around here. What you want? You in danger. Big danger. People get shot here regularly. Hell, someone probably already done put a hit on you.\u201d</p> <p>The rest of the neighborhood took notice. Kids still dressed in Catholic school uniforms ran toward us and parents descended from porches, circling me in a scrum of questions and accusations.</p> <p>\u201cMy child saw you earlier looking at the memorial of that murdered boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you drive by so slowly, then look me straight in the eye, then come back five minutes later?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou got an accent, just like the new cops they are using have.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dbebf7cc33d79e0d95ebc9282c0c8bcb0b830d1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbebf7cc33d79e0d95ebc9282c0c8bcb0b830d1d/0_498_7360_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chanel Baney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chanel Baney, 18, says she was harassed by police officers when she was 16.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I answered as many questions as I could: I wasn\u2019t a cop, and I was here to write an article. That set off a second wave of frustration:</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re tired of being portrayed as nothing but thugs and killers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJournalists just shove cameras in our faces and lie about us. Take shit out of context.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just going to get the facts about that boy\u2019s death wrong.\u201d</p> <p>I handed over my driver\u2019s license and a young woman, 18-year-old Chanel Baney, found my author page online. She skimmed through some of my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-arnade\">articles</a>. \u201cThese headlines are legitimate.\u201d</p> <p>The two young men went away, and the rest of the neighborhood now surrounded me with openness and a desire to talk.</p> <p>Chanel offered up her story first. \u201cI ran inside when your car came, because I am scared of the police after what they did to me.\u201d She told me that when she was 16 she had gone to a friend\u2019s birthday party in a white neighborhood, only to be harassed by the police. \u201cI was just leaving when they approached and accused me of crazy things, things I couldn\u2019t have done. They confused me with someone else. When I argued I had done nothing wrong, I was thrown down, tased and charged with resisting arrest.\u201d</p> <p>The neighbors nodded. A mother named Yolanda Maddy explained how every child is taught to be wary of the police. If questioned or stopped, they\u2019re told to do their best to maintain their cool. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, you can die.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30c11e76c0983afe5123786d119c1029edf0a71a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30c11e76c0983afe5123786d119c1029edf0a71a/0_459_7360_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sabrina Clark: \u2018we have to watch out ourselves\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sabrina Clark: \u2018We have to watch out ourselves.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Arnade for The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I left, an older woman, Sabrina Clark, apologized. \u201cThis neighborhood is good.

African American workers were locked out of most jobs and unions well into the 1940s. It was only when the second world war brought a surge in demand for labor that factories grudgingly acquiesced to hiring them. By the 1950s, the black population was growing rapidly, with most new arrivals coming from the rural south \u2013 and although they found more and better jobs, they didn\u2019t find <a href=\"http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Content.aspx?dsNav=Ny:True,Ro:0,N:4294963828-4294963805&amp;dsNavOnly=N:1165&amp;dsRecordDetails=R:CS502&amp;dsDimensionSearch=D:black+history,Dxm:All,Dxp:3&amp;dsCompoundDimensionSearch=D:black+history,Dxm:All,Dxp:3#rights\">less racism</a>.</p> <p>Winston Williams, 84, came to Milwaukee in 1948, and like many retirees spends each morning in the neighborhood McDonald\u2019s to gossip with friends. He was born in Turrell, Arkansas, and put to work picking cotton at eight years old. It was harsh work for little pay, but he started saving and by age 16 he had enough to leave.</p> <p>\u201cI remember that day perfectly. I could tell the time by the shadows the cotton cast, and when it got time for the morning bus north, I waved bye-bye to my family, and walked right out of the fields. I came here because there was talk of good jobs available. And there were. But you only could live in this one here neighborhood.\u201d He gestured out the window, \u201cIf you went south of North Avenue, no way.

He was born in Crawfordsville, Arkansas, and moved to Milwaukee in 1964. \u201cRacism here was just as bad, but different. In the south they let you know it. Here they lied to you, and penned you in to this one neighborhood like a farm animal.\u201d</p> <p>The other assembled men all nodded. Each had their own variation of this story: a move away from sharecropping in the south to a Milwaukee that had plenty of jobs, but also plenty of racism.</p> <p>Black people in Milwaukee were mostly limited to manual labor jobs, and only allowed to rent in a single neighborhood. As a result, home ownership was rare. It is those <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/3/2/703620/-\">accumulated frustrations</a> that led to demands that culminated in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Selma-North-Rights-Insurgency-Milwaukee/dp/0674057295\">the 1960s fight for basic civil rights</a>. After that came a backlash of violent white counter-protests against the black community.<br></p> <p>The protests ended in legal victories which were impressive on paper \u2013 but by most residents\u2019 accounts, things haven\u2019t changed much. They live primarily in the same low-income neighborhoods, still primarily rent and don\u2019t own their homes, and still feel harassed by the police.</p> <p>Many residents point to only one big difference: there\u2019s no jobs. The factories and big companies that offered up reliable union jobs without a need for college degrees \u2013 places like AO Smith, International Harvester, American Motors \u2013 all downsized or left in the 1980s and 1990s, leaving little work for those without a college education.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You ain\u2019t lazy if nobody will hire you.

He is excited to show me around, happy to explain his business, but also discouraged.</p> <p>\u201cLook. My dad is a cop, so I see both sides. But for us, for black kids, being outside is dangerous. One slip-up, one deviation, and we are incarcerated, or worse. We have no choice. We cannot do anything out of the norm presented to us. The only outlet we have is music and fashion. It is a kind of slavery of expectations.\u201d</p> <p>Venice Williams, a Lutheran minister and a local community activist, also lives in the neighborhood. She has helped turn an empty litter-filled block into a huge community garden where locals can grow their own food. \u201cThis community has been so hurt.

The garden for me is a space to provide healing.\u201d</p> <p>When I ask her about Syville\u2019s memorial and those who stand guard, she\u2019s quick to say she wishes it were different, she wishes they would find another way, but she is also quick to remind me: \u201cOur young people are tired of being humiliated by police. Tired of being researched and over-analyzed by journalists and non-profits. This behavior, the clothing, the music, and sometimes the drugs and violence, this is the only toolbox these kids have. It is one filled with a need for pride and protection.\u201d</p> <p>My last night in Milwaukee, I wanted to have a drink. Unlike many other poor minority neighborhoods across the country, Milwaukee is filled with locally owned bars. I asked a few white acquaintances if they would want to join me. Everyone turned me down for various reasons, but some were a bit more blunt. \u201cThat is the neighborhood where people get shot.\u201d</p> <p>After spending much of the last seven years photographing minority neighborhoods, I am used to hearing them described as \u201cthe neighborhood where people get shot\u201d by many who have no care to look further into the issue. One variation was used by Donald Trump in the debate on Monday, when he claimed \u201c<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/26/presidential-debate-donald-trump-living-in-hell-black-people/\">African Americans and Hispanics are living in hell. You walk down the street and you get shot.</a>\u201d</p> <p>They are indeed the neighborhoods were people get shot, and sometimes it is by the police. Almost always it is the black residents themselves who get hurt. Yet these neighborhoods are far more than that: they are filled with residents who have long been demeaned, humiliated, and denied equal civil rights and opportunities. They are people who are just trying to get by, and who desire what anyone else wants: to work a decent job, and a chance for dignity.</p> <p>A few blocks before the bar, I ran into Charles Jones, 61, who was closing up his barber shop.

Agents play an important role in the business of the game and we want to ensure that players and clubs get the best possible service within an agreed set of rules and regulations which apply to all stakeholders.</p> <p>\u201cWe are totally committed to helping any investigation into the various allegations and to continue to work with the relevant football authorities, led by The FA, to further explore what steps can be taken in English football to put in place an effective system of licensing and codes of conduct for agents.</p> <p>\u201cThe global move to deregulation has not worked and it has allowed the system to be more open to manipulation and abuse. The time has come for the key stakeholders in this country to genuinely come together to establish a new framework for the future and we would be happy to progress those discussions with immediate effect.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, changes to the current set-up should also be enforceable globally and this must involve UEFA and FIFA to help spread best practice around the world and re-introduce a system of licensing and regulation which works and is meaningful. We can make a positive start here to promote a better approach across the game.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57ebd4b6e4b049b74e4caf95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-28T14:35:25.716Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Quiz!

  "<p>The EU budget commissioner, Kristalina Georgieva, has entered the race to become the United Nations\u2019 next secretary general, after the Bulgarian government swung its backing behind her.</p> <p>The country\u2019s prime minister, Boyko Borisov, said that its previous candidate, Irina Bokova, the head of the UN cultural organisation Unesco, had failed to win enough support in the first five straw polls held by the security council, finishing sixth out of nine in the latest ballot on Monday. Georgieva <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/georgieva/announcements/izyavlenie-na-kristalina-georgieva-zamestnik-predsedatel-na-evropeyskata-komisiya-statement-vice_en\">put out a statement</a> from Brussels on Wednesday, saying she accepted the nomination.</p> <p>She is expected to appear before the UN general assembly to present her manifesto in open session, as the other candidates have done, under a new procedure aimed at greater transparency in a usually murky process.<br></p> <p>There is no mechanism for a country to withdraw a candidacy, and Bokova has been quoted in the Bulgarian press as saying she has no plans to quit, so both Bulgarian candidates may run in the next security council ballot, on 5 October.<br></p> <p>It is unclear what impact Georgieva\u2019s late entrance will have on a contest that is already volatile and unpredictable. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister and UN high commissioner, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/antonio-guterres-takes-step-closer-to-becoming-un-secretary-general\">emerged as the clear leader</a> in successive ballots, but it is thought that Russia might try to veto his candidacy in the October vote.</p> <p>Moscow has said it would prefer the next UN secretary general to be an eastern European, and Georgieva won a good reputation as an effective administrator and advocate as head of EU humanitarian affairs. </p> <p>However, it is not certain that the Russians would accept Georgieva, who is also the vice-president of the European commission, which has been enforcing sanctions on Russia for the annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine. There was an <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/scandal-brewing-between-putin-and-merkel-over-un-nomination/\">angry backlash</a> from the Kremlin when Angela Merkel lobbied Vladimir Putin in Georgieva\u2019s favour during the G20 summit in China.</p> <p>The French government was also irritated by Merkel\u2019s attempt to influence the contest, and has strongly supported Guterres. Georgieva, a former World Bank economist, would not be assured of Paris\u2019s support.

  "<p>Time-travel is a recurring trope in pop film and TV culture. Whether it\u2019s Marty McFly in Back to the Future, Tom Cruise in Minority Report, or the forthcoming Timeless and Frequency, it is something couch potatoes love to nerd out to.</p> <p>While Oprah Winfrey and director Ava DuVernay\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py1GVEAVv4E\">Queen Sugar</a> series isn\u2019t a sci-fi fantasy, it does deal with time travel on a symbolic level. The show, based on the novel of the same name<a href=\"https://www.colorlines.com/articles/queen-sugar-author-natalie-baszile-planting-sugar-cane-riding-zydeco-trail-and-blessing-tv\"> by Natalie Baszile</a>, follows the family drama of the three Bordelon siblings: Charley, an NBA wife and business mogul in Los Angeles; Ralph Angel, a single-father parolee with tough luck and a troubled past; and Nova, a journalist and activist with a complicated personal life. The trio reunites back at their familial home in St Josephine, Louisiana, due to the death of their father Ernest, who left them his sugarcane farm.</p> <p>The central narrative is their family drama, but Queen Sugar also tackles the African American nostalgia for \u2013 or fear of \u2013 symbolic time travel. Going back to the south creates ambivalence in black characters. It\u2019s a reconnection to ancestral and spiritual roots, but also means confronting the pain of a place in which their ancestors were dehumanized. </p> <p>Though research has shown that the idea of time as linear is more framing than fact (born from Eurocentric visions of \u201cthe progress narrative\u201d and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@chanda/decolonising-science-reading-list-339fb773d51f#.3b7lpuvrf\">how science was also \u201ccolonized\u201d during colonization</a>), people born within western civilization\u2019s cultural influence tend to look at the past as \u201cregressive\u201d and the future as \u201cprogressive\u201d. Within US history, this conception has a geographic \u201cnorth\u201d versus \u201csouth\u201d element. Therefore, in the general US historical imagination, for black people, leaving the south was tantamount to travelling to the future. Staying in the south was being stuck in limbo, and going back to the south, like going back in time, is inherently regressive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"471353dc1110f4918c3915465d9429ea7663bb7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/471353dc1110f4918c3915465d9429ea7663bb7a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The series alludes to the idea of going back to the land.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The series alludes to the idea of going back to the land.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patti Perret/Oprah Winfrey Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Charley Bordelon\u2019s move from liberal urban Hollywood to the rural Louisiana highlights the difficult transition in her life, but also calls on different historical instances in which black people had to go back to the land (during and in the aftermath of the Haitian Revolution, Reconstruction-era sharecropping, worker camps, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABpWhY5Xzk\">the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola</a>, for instance). So while nostalgia is a universal human emotion, romanticizing the past is deeply racialized within American history. </p> <p>To give a different example, westerns are rooted in mainstream America\u2019s nostalgia of \u201chome on the range\u201d living, frontierism, manifest destiny, and prosperity gospel (the idea that social, political, or economic power or the lack thereof is directly correlated with divine will, favoritism, or a person or group\u2019s faith). But for Native Americans, westerns bring back memories of their physical and cultural genocide. </p> <p>Our nostalgia is a megaphone for racial subjectivity of American history (but also any racially diverse country\u2019s history) and the blind spots it can cause. In a piece for the New York Times, James Baldwin <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-dream.html\">once wrote</a> \u201cIt comes as a great shock to see Gary Cooper killing off the Indians, and although you are rooting for Gary Cooper, that the Indians are you.\u201d</p> <p>Queen Sugar screens at a time where racial subjectivity is clear in the 2016 presidential election, where the call for change and the desire to \u201cgo back\u201d (literally or symbolically) collide. </p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. This phrase appeals to mainstream white voters, but it undoubtedly awakens the historical anxieties of black people especially. The word \u201cagain\u201d begs the question that if America is not great now, then what time period is the Trump campaign is referring to? And for many minorities, the answer doesn\u2019t matter, since backwards time-travel for them is regressive. Comedian Louis CK\u2019s joked on how African Americans would avoid going backwards if time machines existed, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyQTAIiCa4Y\">calling time travel a \u201cwhite privilege\u201d</a>. </p> <p>As a show deeply informed by its diverse depictions of blackness, Queen Sugar taps into the \u201cprogress narrative\u201d historical zeitgeist of African Americans. The death of Ernest Bordelon, the father of the three siblings, sparks their return to St Josephine, but it also augments their need to conquer their individual struggles (Charley caught up in her husbands sexual assault scandal; Ralph Angel struggling to be a good father as an ex-convict whose son\u2019s mother is a recovering drug addict; Nova wrestling with her political life as journalist and activist with her role as \u201cthe other woman\u201d in a complicated affair). </p> <p>These anxieties are amplified not only through the racial tension shown in the episodes (for example, a genteel white landowner who wants to buy the farm, black adolescents locked up in adult prisons, or white repo-men who come to take their father\u2019s tractor), but the actual setting: a sugarcane farm. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74a92b1e061f04a1a4c88dcd086ee0574ffa5ccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a92b1e061f04a1a4c88dcd086ee0574ffa5ccd/0_0_4800_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All of the Bordelon siblings are chasing different types of \u201cprogress\u201d in their lives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All of the Bordelon siblings are chasing different types of \u201cprogress\u201d in their lives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Skip Bolen/Oprah Winfrey Network</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> In many literary or visual media with a narrative conflict between characters, the setting is a conflict as well. Indiana Jones running from a giant bolder, or Matt Damon, who has to \u201cscience the shit\u201d out Mars\u2019 terrain to stay alive in The Martian, are examples of this. </p> <p>While a sugarcane farm isn\u2019t a trap or another planet, it augments the internal and external conflict of the characters. Charlie has business acumen, but her affluent California upbringing distances her from the complex work it entails to grow sugar cane. Ralph Angel has the physical stamina, good intentions, and eagerness to help, but his impulsiveness causes him to make bad decisions. And as of now, Nova is playing a facilitator role in running the farm, as she\u2019s busy working on a watchdog story digging into a criminal justice scandal affecting young, black male Louisianans (something her brother may have been a victim of). </p> <p>All of the Bordelon siblings are chasing different types of \u201cprogress\u201d in their lives. But their efforts are impeded by the different forces of the past, and the sugarcane farm is a physical proxy for these things: Ernest\u2019s death, his struggles as a black farmer, the complicated relationships they have with him and between themselves, and all the historical struggles (both within US racial history and locally in St Josephine) they inherited once they inherited the farm. </p> <p>But aside from the setting, DuVernay and her writing team augment it through the characters and the choices she made while adapting Baszile\u2019s novel. In the book, Charley is an inner-city art teacher and widower (her husband got shot in a hold up from refusing to give up his stuff) drowned in student loans. While her move to Saint Josephine is still informed by her father\u2019s death and the racial and gendered tension of her presence, this backstory gives the relocation a more redemptive, \u201cstarting a new life\u201d quality to it; that although the adjustment is tough, the move is ultimately good for her and her daughter. </p> <p>But in the show, Charley is recast as a rich NBA wife and business owner going through a career and marriage crisis. This greatly increases the conflict inherent in the move: the dramatic lifestyle change in going from liberal, cosmopolitan, multi-cultural Hollywood to the conservative, rural Louisiana. This astute backstory alteration heightens the tension of both Charley\u2019s adjustment, the setting as an obstacle and the conflict within her family. </p> <p>The Bordelon tribe\u2019s complicated relationship is a metaphor for the themes that arise in many African Americans\u2019 complicated relationship with American history: pain, hope, sense of responsibility, baggage, searching for home, displacement, gif-and-a-curse dichotomies, double consciousness and more.

It ended with news filtering out to the media crews huddled outside that a \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d Allardyce had agreed to quit by \u201cmutual consent\u201d. He will be replaced for the next four matches, against Malta, Slovenia, Scotland and Spain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/gareth-southgate-england-sam-allardcye-exit\">by the under-21 manager, Gareth Southgate</a>.</p> <p>Alongside a general impression of greed that will not have played well with fans or an FA workforce that has recently undergone a round of redundancies, there were specific issues in the taped conversations that the FA felt it could not ignore.</p> <p>Allardyce also offered advice on how to \u201cget around\u201d the FA\u2019s own regulations on third-party ownership, was disparaging about his predecessor Roy Hodgson\u2019s speech impediment, said that assistant Gary Neville should \u201csit down and shut up\u201d, and criticised the FA\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d -Wembley redevelopment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8b1873497c5e93c85cbdf28f17bbba4740fd67be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b1873497c5e93c85cbdf28f17bbba4740fd67be/596_309_3039_1823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Allardyce arrives back at his home in Bolton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam Allardyce arrives back at his home in Bolton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Currie/BPI/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some of those remarks could have been explained away as embarrassing indiscretions, the advice on circumventing the FA\u2019s own transfer regulations was particularly problematic ahead of a week in which it may be forced to announce investigations into other elements of the Telegraph\u2019s revelations.</p> <p>\u201cAllardyce\u2019s conduct, as reported today, was inappropriate of the England manager. He accepts he made a significant error of judgment and has apologised,\u201d the FA said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, due to the serious nature of his actions, the FA and Allardyce have mutually agreed to terminate his contract with immediate effect. This is not a decision that was taken lightly, but the FA\u2019s priority is to protect the wider interests of the game and maintain the highest standards of conduct in football. The manager of the England men\u2019s senior team is a position which must demonstrate strong leadership and show respect for the integrity of the game at all times.\u201d</p> <p>Allardyce said he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d after offering a \u201csincere and wholehearted apology\u201d for his actions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/27/sam-allardyce-england-managers-controversies-terry-venables-fabio-capello\">England managers and off-field controversies: from Revie to Hodgson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAlthough it was made clear during the recorded conversations that any proposed arrangements would need the FA\u2019s full approval, I recognise I made some comments which have caused embarrassment,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cAs part of today\u2019s meeting, I was asked to clarify what I said and the context in which the conversations took place. I have co-operated fully in this regard.\u201d</p> <p>If the manner of Allardyce\u2019s \u201cmutually agreed\u201d exit \u2013 a day of fevered speculation that ended in an outcome that felt increasingly inevitable \u2013 did not feel unusual in taking its place among a string of similarly premature and controversial departures by some of his predecessors, then the length of his reign certainly was.</p> <p>The 61-year-old said in July he was \u201cextremely honoured\u201d and promised to return the feelgood factor to an England setup demoralised by a Euro 2016 defeat to Iceland that led to the departure of Hodgson. Handed a \u00a33m-a-year contract, plus bonuses, he said he had fulfilled his lifetime\u2019s ambition by taking over as England manager. But he leaves with the unwanted record of the shortest managerial reign for a permanent appointee.</p> <p>The FA said it had turned to Allardyce following a \u201ccomprehensive and structured\u201d process led by Glenn but also including vice-chairman, David Gill, and technical director, Dan Ashworth. Clarke, the former Football League chairman who took the same role at the FA in August, was not involved in the decision to appoint Allardyce and was believed to take a particularly dim view of the revelations.</p> <p>If Southgate impresses he could take the job on a permanent basis, with the FA keen to develop more of a co-ordinated approach across its teams.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s not an obvious source for laughs \u2013 the office of a&#xa0;council children\u2019s services department, which is where Jo Brand\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/damned\"><strong>Damned</strong></a> (Channel 4) is set. But then nor was the hospital ward that was the setting for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/18/getting-on-interview\">her wonderful sitcom Getting On</a>. Brand, who again co-wrote and stars, looks beyond the obvious, to difficult places where the only way the underpaid and underthanked people who work there can get by is to employ black humour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/sep/23/damned-jo-brands-new-sitcom-finds-the-humour-in-social-work\">Damned: Jo Brand's new sitcom finds the humour in social work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Actually, this first episode of Damned (as in, if you do and if you don\u2019t) is more about the place of work than the work that goes on there. Weird Martin has changed the code for the door, so just getting into the office is hard today. Denise the dictatorial boss is tasked with creating a&#xa0;streamlined cluster team (I think she means making cuts) and employs sneaky former-cop Nitin \u2013 known, borderline racistly, as Night In \u2013 to spy on his colleagues. Nat the temp who can\u2019t work the phones is back, and still can\u2019t work them. Rose and Al (Brand and Alan Davies) are on aforementioned black humour and banter. Ingrid is about to have a hysterectomy, her mind\u2019s not really on the job. The camera operator has a chronic case of the shakes and zoomy-in-and-outy syndrome \u2013 I\u2019m feeling quite dizzy.</p> <p>It \u2013 the office, the boss, the bants, the wobbly camera \u2013 is not unfamiliar. There are a few voicemails from people wanting help, but not an awful lot of helping children. Ah, here\u2019s someone, Anne-Marie, but her case was closed a&#xa0;while back, she\u2019s now just here to stalk Al. Eventually, Rose goes out to visit some children who may need help, and who are in the (poor) care of an ex of hers, as it happens.</p> <p>I could have done with more of that \u2013 more of the social work, less of the office japes and politics, which has been pretty much covered (yes, I am thinking of a certain office in Slough). Social work is clearly something that Brand cares about and knows about (her mother was a social worker); it suits her style \u2013 sort of celebratory and respectful, but in a mucky way. I hope in the coming episodes it will probe deeper, unearth darker secrets, and make Damned the genuinely original thing that Getting On was. And maybe social work will prove to be a great unfracked reserve of tragi-comedy shale gas.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think the paramedics and crews in observational doc <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/25/life-death-day-with-london-ambulance-service-paramedics\"><strong>Ambulance</strong></a> (BBC1) \u2013 which follows members of the London ambulance service as they try to keep 8.6 million Londoners alive \u2013 go underappreciated. They\u2019re heroes and, if some of them seem to know it, well, that\u2019s probably allowed. Hell, it looks hard though, what they do: a cardiac arrest here, a shooting over there, suicide, stabbing, more stopped hearts, a big fire. And then maybe a&#xa0;big spike in demand \u2013 surge purple enhanced, it\u2019s called \u2013 which means someone has to make tricky decisions about who gets an ambulance and who doesn\u2019t. If you\u2019re told you don\u2019t require one, it might just mean there simply isn\u2019t an ambulance available.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/25/life-death-day-with-london-ambulance-service-paramedics\">Life, death and black humour: on duty with the London ambulance servic\u200be\u200b</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that everyone who calls 999 does need one, of course, and there are some nice examples of serious pisstakers here. Like the lady who calls with a broken nail. And a call about a dead cat \u2013 dead and buried, so it\u2019s unclear why the caller thinks it needs an ambulance. And another call from the Queen of England. Actually, I think it probably was the Queen of England and they might have been a bit quick to dismiss that one. She could be lying on the floor somewhere, staring up at the ceiling, hoping to see a blue flash reflected in chandelier or gilding.</p> <p>Incidentally, I wonder if her son and heir was watching <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/hub/fishing-impossible/2a4015\"><strong>Fishing Impossible</strong></a> (ITV). Why? Because these three clowns \u2013 Charlie, Jason and Blowfish \u2013 are on a ship off the Falkland Islands trying to catch a Patagonian toothfish. Don\u2019t you remember, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/13/prince-charles-black-spider-memos-stranger-topics-badgers-patagonian-toothfish\">Black Spider Letters</a>? It was about the most interesting revelation from them. Charles loves those Patagonian toothfish like he loves his own brothers, and he doesn\u2019t want them eaten, however delicious they are. Especially not by someone called Blowfish (I wonder if he actually does; I remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/02/paul-mertons-secret-stations-review-out-of-the-ordinary-out-of-the-way\">Paul Merton tossing off a salmon</a> on the telly once).</p> <p>Oh, it doesn\u2019t really matter, because neither Blowfish, nor Charlie nor Jason, catches even one single toothfish. It\u2019s a whole show, about not catching a fish.</p>"
