  "<p>West Ham football club has pledged to take over the direct running of its women\u2019s side after being accused of discrimination by the team\u2019s chair.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Stephen Hunt, the chairman of <a href=\"http://www.westhamladies.co.uk/\">West Ham United Ladies</a>, has lodged a formal complaint with the Football Association after claiming his players were forced to play in last year\u2019s kit and to pay for their own transport to games.</p> <p>The women\u2019s team was unable to afford physiotherapists, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37535073\">Hunt claimed</a>, and players were having to warm up by running alongside a busy road after they said their access to the club\u2019s training grounds was restricted.</p> <p>The club has now announced its intention to bring the running of the women\u2019s side \u201cin-house\u201d, saying that the current arrangement, in which \u201cthe day-to-day running of the [women\u2019s side] was transferred to a third party some years ago ... has simply not worked\u201d.</p> <p>Hunt, the club said in a statement, had \u201crefused to align with West Ham\u2019s principles throughout his tenure as chairman and has, on a number of occasions, threatened the club. </p> <p>\u201cThe club have been working for some time on plans to take West Ham United Ladies FC \u2018in-house\u2019 and, in light of Mr Hunt\u2019s most recent deeply concerning comments, we will now be seeking to do so at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cWe will, of course, seek to maintain the current West Ham United Ladies FC squad personnel where possible, and provide them with the best possible support and management moving forward.\u201d As a result, the statement said, \u201cwomen\u2019s football at West Ham United will become bigger, better and stronger\u201d.</p> <p>West Ham United Ladies was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.westhamladies.co.uk/club/History?id=27221\">founded in 1992</a>, and now competes in the southern division of the FA Women\u2019s Premier League, the third division of the female game. But the formal relationship between the two sides has historically been unclear. </p> <p>Asked who owned the side, Hunt told the Guardian he had \u201cno idea\u201d. He was appointed chairman in March 2015 by \u201ca committee of fans\u201d after seeing an advert for the position on an Essex football website, he said.</p> <p>He had complained to the FA that the club was in breach of its obligations to promote grassroots football, and had discriminated against the women\u2019s team, he added. An FA spokeswoman confirmed it had received a complaint, which it was reviewing.</p> <p>In 2014 the club was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/04/united-ladies-west-ham-fundraising\">forced to defend itself</a> against accusations of neglecting the women\u2019s side, after the then captain Stacey Little set up a fundraising page to appeal for donations to pay for kit and pitch hire, describing the team as \u201cself-funded\u201d.</p> <p>The former West Ham player Julian Dicks, who managed the women\u2019s team in the 2014-15 season, said he supported the club\u2019s plans to bring the team under direct management. \u201cIt was clear when I was the manager, and it\u2019s clear now, the current administration isn\u2019t working,\u201d he said. \u201cThe girls there work very hard and deserve to be successful. However, they will only get that if the club and the team are managed properly.\u201d</p> <p>Hunt said if the situation had not changed West Ham Ladies would have gone bust. \u201cSo on the one hand I am delighted that West Ham United have been reminded we exist. Someone had to say something and it may as well be me.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.blackdownhillsnaturalfutures.org/news\">first black dormouse ever recorded in the UK</a> has taken up residence in a nest box in the Blackdown Hills of Somerset.</p> <p> Britain has only one native species of dormouse, the hazel dormouse. The one discovered in Somerset is a hazel dormouse but instead of having the normal golden-brown fur it is black. </p> <p> A handful of black hazel dormice were found in Germany in the 1970s and two more in 2015 but it appears the Somerset specimen is a British first. </p> <p> The discovery was made when staff, trainees and volunteers from the <a href=\"http://www.blackdownhillsnaturalfutures.org/\">Blackdown Hills Natural Futures </a>project were checking dormouse nest boxes as part of the national dormouse monitoring programme. </p> <p> This year, the project provided 300 nest boxes and more than 60 volunteers have installed and regularly checked them. One was found to have the black specimen inside. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1G-oCSwoHE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L1G-oCSwoHE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Video footage of the discovery</figcaption> </figure>   <p> Conrad Barrowclough, the project officer, said: \u201cLearning about and protecting our natural heritage is what we\u2019re all about so finding such a rare dormouse on our doorstep is fantastic, especially at a time when Britain\u2019s dormouse population is under threat.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://ptes.org/\"> The People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species </a>(PTES), which collates national dormouse monitoring programme findings, <a href=\"https://ptes.org/rare-black-dormouse-blackdown-hills/\">confirmed the rarity of the find.</a></p> <p> Ian White, the PTES dormouse officer said: \u201cThe national monitoring programme has been running for more than 25 years, with volunteers collecting data on thousands of dormice at nearly 400 sites. Not once has anyone come across a black dormouse.\u201d</p> <p> Britain\u2019s dormice are under threat of extinction, with changes in the way farmland and woodland is managed making it harder for the creatures to survive. </p> <p> Dormice need well-managed woodlands connected by hedgerows rich in fruiting plants so that they can spread and prosper. They thrived at a time when there were more hedgerows, and when hazel trees in woodlands were regularly coppiced providing plenty of nuts for food.</p> <p> This black dormouse was discovered on farmland that is being managed with nature conservation in mind. The farm\u2019s hedgerows are managed by hand using traditional techniques, bringing great diversity of wildlife, including a healthy population of dormice. </p> <p> The first known recorded evidence of black dormice came in 1972 when five were found living in a small forest in a hedgerow-rich landscape in northern Germany. </p> <p> It was thought to be a freak occurrence <a href=\"https://ptes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Dormouse-monitor-winter-2015.pdf \">until September 2015 when a nest in a hop shrub was found about six miles away.</a> Inside was a golden-coloured mother with four four-week old juveniles. Two were brown and two black with a white throat. </p> <p> </p>",
  "<p>It is widely recognized that African Americans in the US are more likely to be arrested, convicted and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/mass-incarceration-black-americans-higher-rates-disparities-report\">imprisoned</a>. A new <a href=\"http://www.stateofblackimmigrants.com/\">report</a> finds this pattern of criminalization has had a spillover effect for black immigrants.</p> <p>People from Africa and the Caribbean are twice as likely to face deportation due to a criminal conviction compared with those from other regions, and more than three times as likely to be detained while their cases are pending, according to the Black Alliance for Just Immigration. </p> <p>\u201cThis report shows black immigrants encounter major social and economic challenges in the US because of systemic racism,\u201d said Opal Tometi, the Alliance\u2019s executive director and a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, who is a first-generation Nigerian American and was born and raised in Arizona.</p> <p>But criminal convictions are just one of the reasons immigrants are placed in deportation proceedings. Others are funneled into deportation proceedings simply because of immigration violations. Overall, black immigrants are slightly more likely to face deportation for any reason than immigrants overall. Black immigrants comprise about 7% of immigrants in the US, and nearly 11% of those facing deportation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/17/privilege-policing-black-chicago-white-north-side\">Privilege, policing and living while black in Chicago's white north side</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The period examined in the report spans the two decades since the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act broadened the scope of crimes that are deportable offenses, including possession of marijuana. </p> <p>\u201cOur theory is that many black immigrants live in urban areas that are subject to heavier policing than other communities,\u201d said Carl Lipscombe, policy director for the Alliance and a co-author of the report. \u201cSo they are more likely to face a police encounter, and more likely to get arrested and end up in court.\u201d</p> <p>Lipscombe says he witnessed this pattern as a public defender in New York City, where a federal judge found the police department\u2019s stop-and-frisk program unconstitutional after it was shown to disproportionately target black people.</p> <p>\u201cI encountered dozens of young black immigrants who were arrested for minor offenses such as possession of marijuana and the district attorney would offer them a $25 fine if they pleaded guilty,\u201d said Lipscombe. \u201cThis is why we say black immigrants are similarly situated to African Americans, except they face the additional consequence of deportation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/wage-gap-black-white-americans\">Wage gap between white and black Americans is worse today than in 1979</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of the report\u2019s new findings stem from a treasure trove of data about immigrants in detention originally obtained through an open records request by Buzzfeed News, which analyzed those facing deportation on non-criminal grounds and found three-quarters of Mexicans were detained, compared with 39% for all others.</p> <p>The Black Alliance for Just Immigration asked New York University law school\u2019s Immigrant Rights Clinic and a statistician to conduct a first-of-its-kind analysis of detained black immigrants facing deportation due to criminal convictions.</p> <p>\u201cThe data confirms what advocates have long suspected,\u201d said report co-author and NYU law student Juliana Morgan-Trostle.</p> <p>Since the government does not track immigrants based on race, she said the analysis identified black immigrants by their country of origin, including those from countries such as Haiti and Nigeria, and then compared with the overall immigrant population.</p> <p>When it compared immigrant groups by region in fiscal year 2013, it found 76% of black immigrants were deported on criminal grounds, in contrast to 45% overall, 38% of Asian immigrants, 47% of South American immigrants and 54% of European immigrants.</p> <p>The new report on black immigrants also examines census data that shows they have similar rates of educational attainment as white and Asian immigrants, but rank highest on unemployment, with one in five living below the poverty line. </p> <p>It calls on lawmakers to address the disparate rates of detention and deportation for black immigrants by eliminating certain drug offenses as a cause for deportation, and by restoring judicial discretion in such cases.</p>",
  "<p>These days, Raed al-Saleh doesn\u2019t have to see a&#xa0;warplane to know what kind of bombs it drops. He just needs to hear it. \u201cIt\u2019s very depressing,\u201d Saleh says. \u201cBased on its sound, we can predict the kind of airplane, and then anticipate the scale of the destruction.\u201d He has reached the stage where he hopes for the rumble of a Mig-29, rather than a Su-24. It\u2019s the Su-24s that carry the cluster bombs.</p> <p>In rebel-held Syria, where the Syrian regime and its Russian allies are dropping more bombs than ever before, Saleh isn\u2019t the only person who has learned to discern between the roar of different warplanes. But he is among the best practised. He\u2019s the head of the Syrian civil defence, a team of 2,700 civilian rescue workers that saves people from the rubble of airstrikes across rebel-held Syria. Known internationally as the White Helmets, after the colour of their hardhats, they are the subject of a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/sep/23/the-white-helmets-syria-volunteer-rescue-workers-heroes-hope-horror\" title=\"\">Netflix documentary</a>; the winners of the Right Livelihood award, known as the alternative Nobel peace prize; and <a href=\"https://nobelpeaceprize.whitehelmets.org/en\" title=\"\">nominees for the real thing</a>. And understandably so: at least 130 White Helmets have been killed in the course of saving more than 60,000 lives.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone need saving?\u201d asks Khaled Farah, a builder turned rescuer, during a moving new documentary about the Syrian civil defence. \u201cAnything you need, we\u2019re the White Helmets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8171733be885dd5650fb91ba2e4ef7b722cd4b2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8171733be885dd5650fb91ba2e4ef7b722cd4b2c/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There are 2,700 civilians in the White Helmets, rescuing people from the rubble of airstrikes across rebel-held Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are 2,700 civilians in the White Helmets, rescuing people from the rubble of airstrikes across rebel-held Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I meet Saleh on the sidelines of the recent UN general assembly in New York. He has donned a shirt and tie for his meetings with diplomats and politicians, but still looks out of place. He\u2019s a&#xa0;man of action transplanted to a&#xa0;parallel reality of suits and lanyards, of grand talk but few decisions. At the UN headquarters down the road, diplomats publicly maintain that a Syrian ceasefire is still in play. From out in the real world, Saleh has just learned of another round of regime attacks on rebel-held Aleppo. The news seems to exhaust him. There are big bags under his eyes, which he spends several moments rubbing.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no signs of improvements,\u201d Saleh says. \u201cToday in Aleppo, 12 people were killed by the airstrikes. There are hundreds of thousands of civilians under siege who need supplies. For the past month, nothing has entered Aleppo, so we expect that in less than a month, the supplies will run out.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/03/i-need-peace-seven-year-old-bana-tweets-her-life-in-besieged-aleppo\">'I need peace': seven-year-old Bana tweets her life in besieged Aleppo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During his time in New York, things will worsen still, and hundreds more will die. The bombing raids reach an unprecedented intensity, the regime attempts a ground invasion, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/23/495160608/syrias-famed-white-helmets-group-says-its-being-targeted-in-new-offensive\" title=\"\">the White Helmets\u2019 bases fall under attack</a>. Yet inside the UN, Russia and the US cannot agree on how to end \u2013 or even pause \u2013 the bloodshed.</p> <p>\u201cNew York is another world,\u201d Saleh sighs. \u201cWe hear a lot of talk about peace and war and terrorism and refugees and UN convoys. But we don\u2019t see decisive actions. We don\u2019t see the political will to address the roots of the problem. And we don\u2019t understand why that is.\u201d</p> <p>On the ground, the humanitarian effort is largely left to groups of volunteers such as the White Helmets. Before the war, most of them knew little about rescuing bomb victims. Saleh himself was an electronics salesman, buying Chinese-made gadgets from wholesalers in Aleppo, and selling them in western Syria. Another man featured in the documentary, Mohamed Farah, was a tailor. Khaled, Mohamed\u2019s brother, was a&#xa0;builder.</p> <p>To begin with, these men formed disparate rescue teams, without a central command. They were united by a desire to stay out of the fighting. \u201cIt\u2019s better to do humanitarian work than to be armed,\u201d says Farah during an interview in the film. \u201cBetter to rescue a soul than to take one.\u201d</p> <p>To begin with, they were untrained, and so less effective. In 2013, not long after Saleh first joined a rescue team, they arrived at a bombsite in a market in Darkoush, north-west Syria. At least 112 people were killed. \u201cThe smell of burnt bodies was everywhere and the first responders felt like they were helpless,\u201d Saleh says. \u201cWe rescued just two or three people, and it was&#xa0;depressing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95cc6693f1309c2221d6c4272148cf72add379ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95cc6693f1309c2221d6c4272148cf72add379ff/0_106_4665_2799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raed al-Saleh during an interview in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raed al-Saleh during an interview in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernd von Jutrczenka/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the border that year, Turkey began to invite different rescue teams for training, and Saleh was chosen by his colleagues as their representative. Again, it was a sobering experience. He was tasked with finding corpses in a mock-up bomb site \u2013 and found no one.</p> <p>\u201cThen the trainers turned the lights on and guided us to the people underneath the rubble in the room,\u201d says Saleh. \u201cWe were shocked. The trainers told us: this is the difference between a trained rescue worker and an untrained one, between a blind person and a person who can see. And, at that moment, we made a pledge that we had either to quit then and there, or be fully committed to learning all the required skills in order to go back and rescue our people.\u201d</p> <p>It was in the months that followed this experience that the Syrian civil defence was formed. Gradually, the different rescue teams in northern Syria began to coordinate. In 2014, they started standardising their uniform \u2013 a&#xa0;beige jumpsuit \u2013 and agreed to work as a unified entity. At a meeting of 69 different branches, Saleh was elected&#xa0;director.</p> <p>There are few reasons for hope in Syria, but the rise of the White Helmets is one of them. Over time, the rescuers have got steadily better at finding people in the rubble. When a&#xa0;series of strikes hit Darkoush last year, they rescued more than 120 people in 24 hours. One of the most uplifting scenes in the film comes when the Farah brothers spend 16 hours digging through rubble to find \u2013 against all odds \u2013 a baby boy.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know that feeling when you have a seed and it grows into a beautiful bush?\u201d asks Mohamed. \u201cThat\u2019s how we feel knowing that this baby is still alive.\u201d</p> <p>But Saleh cautions that there is often little to celebrate, and that however angelic his work seems to outsiders, it is in fact highly traumatic. \u201cSome may think what we are doing is heroic,\u201d he said during <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/darkness-and-fear-in-aleppo-as-the-bombs-rain-down/2016/09/28/07b65246-842e-11e6-b57d-dd49277af02f_story.html\" title=\"\">a recent talk in Washington</a>. \u201cBut, in fact, it is devastating and depressing beyond belief. You are pulling corpses from the rubble. You don\u2019t know if one day that body will belong to your sister, your brother or your friend.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wj4ncIEDxw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3wj4ncIEDxw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Regime apologists also question the White Helmets\u2019 heroism \u2013 by claiming that they are in cahoots with extremists. It\u2019s a ridiculous smear, says Saleh. \u201cThat\u2019s a normal reaction from the regime,\u201d he says. \u201cThe regime accuses millions of Syrians of being terrorists and extremists. For the regime, anything that emerges independently from the people is classified as an extremist organisation.\u201d</p> <p>For their supporters, the White Helmets remind us that the vast majority of Syrians aren\u2019t soldiers or jihadis, but ordinary civilians. \u201cThere are armed groups in the liberated areas, which have been formed in reaction to Bashar al-Assad\u2019s terrorism,\u201d says Muhammad Fadila, the governor of rebel-held Aleppo. \u201cBut there are also many civilians, and we have universities and hospitals and schools, administrations and directorates, a&#xa0;ministry of education, and of electricity. And the Syrian civil defence.\u201d</p> <p>Some of them, like Saleh, have the option of a more peaceful life in Turkey. But they have sacrificed their safety to protect the people left behind. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is my country,\u201d he says. \u201cIf Syrians don\u2019t help Syrians, who else will come?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Two Tunisian men held in secret CIA prisons for more than a year have told a leading human rights organization they were tortured with gruesome and previously unknown techniques.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/09/dan-jones-cia-torture-cover-report-senate\">Senate investigator breaks silence about CIA's 'failed coverup' of torture report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The men, who were released to Tunisian custody in 2015, described being threatened with placement in an electric chair at a black site prison in Afghanistan in 2002; being beaten with metal batons while their arms were suspended by a bar above their heads; and having their heads pushed into barrels of water. </p> <p>One of the men, Ridha al-Najjar, was a pivotal detainee for the CIA, which believed him to be a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden. Najjar was the first man taken by the CIA to the black site, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-worst-findings-waterboard-rectal\">code-named Cobalt</a> and was where at least one detainee is known to have died. His interrogation became a template for others at the site, according to the CIA inspector general. Najjar said the interrogators forcibly inserted something into his anus. </p> <p>According to a footnote in the 2014 Senate intelligence committee\u2019s investigation into torture, John Brennan, now CIA director, was among the senior CIA officials briefed in the summer of 2002 on the interrogation plan for Najjar. According to the Senate report, the plan included isolation, \u201c\u2018sound disorientation techniques\u2019, \u2018sense of time deprivation\u2019, limited light, cold temperatures, and sleep deprivation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a barrel full of water, and they kept submerging [my head] in the water,\u201d the other Tunisian man, Lotfi al-Arabi El Gherissi, told Human Rights Watch, which shared the two men\u2019s accounts with the Guardian. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a barrel full of water, and they kept submerging [my head] in the water</p> <footer> <cite>Lotfi al-Arabi El Gherissi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Najjar said: \u201cThey would do this until I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and I was on the verge of completely falling apart.\u201d</p> <p>El Gherissi and Najjar both appear by name in the declassified portions of the Senate torture report, which corroborates their CIA captivity, which began in 2002.

Najjar\u2019s account of having an unknown object repeatedly placed in his anus has nothing to do with nutrition. He told Human Rights Watch it occurred when interrogators sought to move him from place to place. After the object\u2019s insertion, he said, \u201cthey carried me upstairs like a package\u201d.</p> <p>Daniel Jones, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/sep/09/daniel-jones-senate-staffer-cia-spying-interview-video\">the former Senate staffer who led its torture investigation</a>, said CIA operatives at the Cobalt black site kept such poor records that it was \u201cimpossible for us, or the CIA, to fully determine how many individuals were detained there \u2013 let alone everything that happened to them.\u201d</p> <p>Jones noted that that Najjar featured significantly in the CIA\u2019s misleading assertion that its so-called \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d or EITs, led the US to Bin Laden.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[It was] impossible for us, or the CIA, to fully determine how many individuals were detained [at Cobalt]</p> <footer> <cite>Daniel Jones, Senate torture investigation leader</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn May 2011, al-Najjar was one of the detainees the CIA cited as having been subjected to the CIA\u2019s EITs and then providing information on Abu Ahmad, the UBL assistant who led to UBL,\u201d Jones said, using an acronym for Bin Laden. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, the Senate found that the information al-Najjar provided was acquired not only prior to the CIA\u2019s use of EITs against al-Najjar, but also prior to al-Najjar being transferred to CIA custody.\u201d</p> <p>El Gherissi and Najjar\u2019s presentation describing having their heads pushed into barrels of water also indicates that the agency\u2019s water tortures went beyond even the widely known technique of waterboarding, in which a restrained detainee has water poured over his nose and mouth to induce a feeling of drowning. </p> <p>Their accounts of submergence also suggest that a lesser-known technique, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/oct/16/cia-torture-water-dousing-waterboard-like-technique\">water dousing</a>\u201d, wherein interrogators dumped large volumes of cold water on detainees that in some cases obstructed breathing, was both more extensive and more similar to waterboarding than previously understood. </p> <p>Najjar told Human Rights Watch that in addition to having his head dunked in a barrel of water between interrogators\u2019 questions, he was also strapped to a board and lowered by his head, upside down, into the barrel. In a description consistent with other accounts of water dousing, he reported being placed within a tarpaulin full of cold water that zipped closed at the top with minimal space for air. </p> <p>The CIA has maintained that it only waterboarded three detainees: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. Earlier accounts of water dousing come from Mohammed and 12 other detainees, none of whom are Najjar or El Gherissi.</p> <p>In 2015, a lawyer for a detainee subjected to water dousing told the Guardian: \u201cYou would laugh the next time you heard the government try to minimize its wrongdoing by drawing a distinction between waterboarding and other forms of water torture.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPCER8xSxKc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gPCER8xSxKc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Former detainees describe unreported CIA torture, in a video released by Human Rights Watch.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>A spokesman for the CIA, Ryan Trapani, told Human Rights Watch the agency \u201creviewed its records and found nothing to support these new claims\u201d.

Nashiri was also threatened with a gun. </p> <p>As with other detainees, torture techniques were often used in combination. Najjar said having his hands suspended above his head by a metal bar made it impossible to sleep.</p> <p>\u201cThey hung me up from my hands, and I was standing on the tips of my toes for 24 hours. That lasted for about a month,\u201d El Gherissi said.

His torture \u201cbecame the model\u201d for others at the black site, according to the CIA inspector general. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch conducted its interviews with Najjar and El Gherissi in August, over a year after their release from Bagram. Their confinement at the airfield detention center for more than a decade prevented them from speaking earlier about their torture \u2013 a consequence of judges\u2019 support for the US justice department\u2019s contention that wartime detentions in Afghanistan were beyond the jurisdiction of federal courts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I believe one of the primary motivations for the decision to hold our clients at Bagram was to keep their torture secret</p> <footer> <cite>Tina Foster, attorney</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAbsolutely, I believe one of the primary motivations for the government\u2019s decision to hold our clients at Bagram (rather than Guant\u00e1namo, for example) was to keep their torture a secret,\u201d Tina Foster, an attorney for Najjar and El Gherissi, said in an email.</p> <p>\u201cEven after President Obama was elected and vowed not to continue the torture program, his administration continued to argue that US courts should not review our client\u2019s cases and prevent us from speaking with them.

  "<p>Great coming-of-age memoirs have a potency rare in literature, and can be just as influential as great novels. <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/richard-wright-9537751\" title=\"\">Richard Wright</a>, outstanding in both genres, was an important 20th-century African American writer, renowned for his 1940 novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/native-son.html\" title=\"\"><em>Native Son</em></a>. Together with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/23/langston-hughes-harlem-house-art-collective-renee-watson\" title=\"\">Langston Hughes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/nov/28/new-york-usa-books\" title=\"\">Ralph Ellison</a>, Wright was crucial in forging an authentic literary consciousness for the black community as it struggled to escape decades of oppression after the civil war.</p> <p>The bestselling <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/black-boy.html\" title=\"\"><em>Black Boy</em></a>, published in 1945 (its original title had been Black Confession), explored the background to <em>Native Son</em>, but was also a visceral and unforgettable account of a young black man\u2019s coming of age in the American south in the bitter decades before the civil rights movement.</p> <p>Full of vivid scenes and arresting vignettes, it begins with four-year-old Richard (\u201cangry, fretful and impatient\u201d) setting fire to the family home, a brilliant opening that establishes young Wright as a fiery protagonist. Indeed, he presents himself throughout <em>Black Boy</em> as a rebel, at odds with both his ailing mother, his faithless, improvident father and tyrannical \u201cGranny\u201d. After the fire, the Wright family headed to Memphis, Tennessee where they lived in \u201ca brick tenement\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The white south said it knew \u2018niggers\u2019 ... well, the white south had never known me \u2013 never known what I thought</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Wright</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Young Richard goes to school; his father deserts the family and his sons are put into care. Eventually, they move to Arkansas, where Wright broods on \u201cthe cultural barrenness of black life\u201d. For him, however, there is not even the consolation of religion. He\u2019s an atheist. In church, when his fellows sing: \u201cAmazing grace, how sweet it sounds\u201d, he is humming under his breath: \u201cA bulldog ran my grandma down.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, Wright\u2019s mature character formed itself: \u201cAt the age of 12 I had an attitude toward life that was to endure, that was to make me sceptical of everything while seeking everything, tolerant of all and yet critical.\u201d</p> <p>This lifelong spirit, he writes, \u201cmade me love burrowing into psychology, into realistic and naturalistic fiction and art, into those whirlpools of politics that had the power to claim the whole of men\u2019s souls.\u201d</p> <p>Thus driven, and to escape the shocking racism of the south, it becomes his ambition to head north to Chicago as soon as he can afford the trip. But first, he must start out in life as a young black man in Memphis.</p> <p>The first half of Wright\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d is set exclusively in the south; the second part, describing his Chicago experiences, entitled The Horror and the Glory, was originally part of a longer book with the working title American Hunger. For various commercial considerations, Wright\u2019s publishers requested that he focus on his Mississippi childhood and drop the final (Chicago) chapters. American Hunger became <em>Black Boy</em>, and would not be published with all parts fully restored until 1991, when the Library of America issued <em>Black Boy (American Hunger)</em>.</p> <p>The British, Vintage edition, though incomplete, is faithful to the 1945 edition. It subtly mythologises Wright\u2019s African American upbringing and fearlessly confronts southern racism. For Wright, coming of age was all to do with claiming and celebrating his identity as a black man. The south, he declared, in a fierce passage, had only allowed him \u201cto be natural, to be real, to be myself\u201d through a negative form of self-expression, \u201cin rejection, rebellion, and aggression\u201d. He continues:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f715f606474a1f5db21f165340b8a4ca194ec102\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f715f606474a1f5db21f165340b8a4ca194ec102/0_924_2480_2452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Wright.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"989\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Men should be able to confront other men without fear or shame\u2019: Richard Wright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The white south said that it knew \u2018niggers\u2019, and I was what the white south called a \u2018nigger\u2019. Well, the white south had never known me \u2013 never known what I thought, what I felt. The white south said I had a \u2018place\u2019 in life. Well, I had never felt my \u2018place\u2019; or, rather, my deepest instincts had always made me reject the \u2018place\u2019 to which the white south had assigned me. It had never occurred to me that I was in any way an inferior being.</em></p> <p>As a youngster in small-town Jackson, Wright knew only too well what it meant to be a \u201cnigger\u201d, a second-class citizen. He worked as a porter in a clothing store; next he worked for an optician; then he moved to a drugstore, sweeping the sidewalk. But he had a fundamental problem. He \u201ccould not make subservience an automatic part of my behaviour\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, in November 1925, he arrived back in Memphis. This was not Chicago (a journey he could not yet afford), but it was a start. He began to read, educating himself by studying the Memphis <em>Commercial Appeal</em>. Here, he stumbled on the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/26/biography.features\" title=\"\">HL Mencken</a>, and had his Damascene moment:</p> <p><em>Yes, this man was fighting, fighting with words. He was using words as a weapon, using them as one would use a club. Could words be weapons?</em></p> <p>Indeed they could. Better still, Mencken was introducing the young writer to a new world: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/feb/07/spinoza-philosophy-god-world\" title=\"\">Spinoza</a>, Gustave Flaubert, Tolstoy, Mark Twain, Thomas Hardy, TS Eliot, and many more. \u201cWere these men real? And how did one pronounce their names?\u201d Wright was hooked. Soon after this, he set off for Chicago:</p> <p><em>I was leaving without a qualm, without a single backward glance. The face of the south I had known was hostile and forbidding, and yet out of all the conflicts and the curses\u2026 I had somehow gotten the idea that life could be different, could be lived in a fuller and richer manner... If I could meet enough of a different life, then, perhaps, gradually and slowly I might learn who I was, what I might be.</em></p> <p>Wright\u2019s closing words evoke the rhetoric of the civil rights movement, making a surprising and unexpected link between himself and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/apr/06/archive-1968-martin-luther-king-non-violence\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King</a>. He has, he writes, \u201ca hazy notion that life could be lived with dignity, that men should be able to confront other men without fear or shame, and that if men were lucky in their living on earth they might win some redeeming meaning for their having struggled here beneath the stars.\u201d</p> <h2>A signature sentence</h2> <p>\u201cA quarter of a century was to elapse between the time when I saw my father sitting with the strange woman and the time when I was to see him again, standing alone upon the red clay of a Mississippi plantation, a share-cropper, clad in ragged overalls, holding a muddy hoe in his gnarled, veined hands \u2013 a quarter of a century during which my mind and consciousness had become so greatly and violently altered that when I tried to talk to him I realised that, though ties of blood made us kin, though I could see a shadow of my face in his face, though there were echoes of my voice in his voice, we were forever strangers, speaking a different language, living on vastly different planes of reality.\u201d <em>(page 32)</em></p> <h2>Three to compare</h2> <p>Ralph Ellison: <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invisible-man.html\" title=\"\"><em>Invisible Man</em></a> (1952)<br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/25/100-best-nonfiction-books-notes-of-a-native-son-james-baldwin\" title=\"\">James Baldwin</a>: <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/notes-of-a-native-son.html\" title=\"\"><em>Notes of a Native Son</em></a><em> </em>(1955)<br>Malcolm X (with Alex Haley): <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/autobiography-of-malcolm-x-2.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</em></a> (1965)</p> <p><em>Black Boy is published by Vintage (\u00a39.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/black-boy.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a38.19</em></a></p>"
