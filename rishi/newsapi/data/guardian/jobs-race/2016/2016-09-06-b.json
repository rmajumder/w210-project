  "<p>Hannah Cockroft has accused the world\u2019s two leading sportswear brands of discrimination after claiming the reason she does not have a kit sponsor is because she does not wear shoes during her wheelchair races.</p> <p>Cockroft, who is expected to be one of the stars of the Paralympic Games in Rio after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/sep/07/hannah-cockroft-paralympics-2012\">winning two golds</a> at London 2012 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/31/hannah-cockroft-great-britain-ipc-world-championships\">three in last year\u2019s world championships</a>, is the dominant figure in her sport but said Adidas and Nike have cited her inability to use their footwear in competition as a justification for not sponsoring her. The 24-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, has been angered by a situation she feels illustrates how disabled athletes are still fighting for greater recognition.</p> <p>\u201cThe real reason?\u201d the ParalympicsGB athlete said. \u201cI have been told it\u2019s because I don\u2019t wear shoes when I compete. What do I do with that? I wear a shirt, I wear trousers, I wear shoes on the podium when I\u2019m collecting a gold medal. But apparently because that\u2019s not when I\u2019m competing that\u2019s not enough. I\u2019ve been told this by Nike, Adidas, all the big brands. I told them it was discrimination. It is discrimination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/03/paralympics-against-odds-rio-can-deliver-games\">Paralympics: against the odds, Rio can deliver Games to treasure | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSome child somewhere watches every single one of us and is inspired to come into sport. They watch us and think: \u2018If they\u2019re wearing that top, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to wear because if that\u2019s what makes them go faster that\u2019s what will make me go faster.\u2019 That is the mindset. If able-bodied children think that when they look at Jess Ennis, then I\u2019m pretty sure disabled children must think like that when they look at me. It\u2019s frustrating. You work as hard as you can. You kind of wonder what more can I win to make you want to sponsor me.\u201d</p> <p>Nike defended its record in disability sport by pointing out it sponsors another British wheelchair racer who does not compete in its footwear, David Weir, and also has deals with ParalympicsGB\u2019s Aled Davies and Hollie Arnold, Marlou van Rhijn of the Netherlands, the USA\u2019s Tatyana McFadden, Lex Gillette, April Holmes, Scout Bassett, Blake Leeper and Alana Nichols, and Brazil\u2019s Ver\u00f4nica Hip\u00f3lito and Fernando Fernandes. The American sportswear giant designed the kit worn by Great British athletes at last year\u2019s IPC world championships in Doha.</p> <p>\u201cNike has a long history of working with Olympians and Paralympians who do not compete in Nike footwear, from Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Simone Biles, to six-times gold medal-winning Paralympian David Weir,\u201d a Nike spokesperson said. \u201cNike works with multiple Paralympic athletes through individual athlete relationships or through partnerships with federations such as USA and Brazil. Nike also supports aspiring Paralympic athletes through sponsorship of the British Athletics futures programme.\u201d</p> <p>Adidas also rejected Cockroft\u2019s claims, pointing out it has designed ParalympicsGB\u2019s kit for the Games. \u201cAs a sports brand we have partnerships with teams, including ParalympicsGB, and individuals across both apparel and footwear,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWhilst we will not discuss negotiations with specific athletes we can say we sponsor a number of athletes who don\u2019t wear footwear to compete.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/31/paralympic-star-disability-support-cuts\">Potential Paralympic star forced to pull out due to cuts in disability support | Frances Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet while Cockroft, who is expected to triumph in the 100m, 400m and 800m T34 events in Rio, has worn Adidas and Nike kit while representing Great Britain in international tournaments, she does not have a kit deal with any company on an individual basis. That leaves her stretched in individual tournaments and during training sessions.</p> <p>Cockroft has had talks about kit sponsorship in the past but it is understood the companies\u2019 offers have fallen below expectations. She has lost one race in the past four years and there is a belief she deserves a deal befitting an elite athlete. While she hopes success in Rio will enhance her appeal, she finds the situation disheartening.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s not my fault that I don\u2019t wear shoes,\u201d she said. \u201cI still get on the track and I still go fast. It shouldn\u2019t really matter what\u2019s on my feet when I\u2019m doing that. In my head, when an athlete gets a kit sponsor, that\u2019s when you\u2019ve made it. On Twitter everyone is either a Nike athlete or an Adidas athlete. I feel like if someone wants to have you as their athlete and wear their kit for every training session and every competition, that\u2019s when you are a true elite athlete.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/sep/07/its-time-to-stop-calling-disabled-people-inspirational-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5xqzj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2696509\"            data-video-name=\"It's time to stop calling disabled people 'inspirational' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57cf0192e4b08603a34924b1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/09/06/160906FrancesRyanIMO_KP-29215531_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/09/06/160906FrancesRyanIMO_KP-29215531_WebM.webm\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11846460&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/sep/07/its-time-to-stop-calling-disabled-people-inspirational-video\">It\u2019s time to stop calling disabled people \u2018inspirational\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cSomeone is proud of what you\u2019re doing.

  "<p>For Goldman Sachs, it was probably an easy hire to make. The bank needed a new chair for its London-based international operations, based in London. The UK had just voted for Brexit, creating complexities over passporting rights and so on. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/08/jose-manuel-barroso-to-become-next-head-of-goldman-sachs-international\">So send for Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso</a>, former head of the European commission, just the chap to guide the bank through the negotiation mash-up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/eu-ethics-watchdog-intervenes-on-jose-manuel-barroso-goldman-job\">EU ethics watchdog intervenes over Barroso's Goldman job</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cue uproar among some of Barroso\u2019s former staff in Brussels. <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/for-strong-exemplary-measures-to-be-taken-against-jm-barroso-for-joining-goldman-sachs-international\">An online petition </a>organised by \u201ca spontaneous group of employees of the European Institutions\u201d has damned him for joining the US investment bank and called for \u201cstrong exemplary measures,\u201d like removal of his pension. Almost 125,000 people have endorsed the view that Barroso\u2019s action is \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d and has caused \u201cdishonour\u201d to the \u201cEuropean civil service and the European Union as a whole\u201d.</p> <p>Up to a point, one can agree. The revolving door between banks and senior bureaucrats and central bankers turns far too freely. Barroso waited only two months after the expiry of his 18-month cooling-off period before taking the Goldman gig. And Goldman, of course, is a bank alleged to have helped Greece to massage its books to get into the euro. Barroso knew the sensitivities and decided to take the job anyway. As a tale of gilded elites shuffling between public and private realms, it\u2019s a classic.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s hard to believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/06/eu-ethics-watchdog-intervenes-on-jose-manuel-barroso-goldman-job\">the EU\u2019s ethical watchdog</a>, prodded by the petition to ask a few questions, will manage a single bark. First, Barroso seems to have obeyed the rules. Second, if Goldman is off-limits, the commission would have to explain why European banks, retirement homes for other former top officials, are acceptable.</p> <p>Third, if the European commission really wanted to preach financial purity and transparency to the world, it would start by shining more light on the tax affairs of Luxembourg, home state of Barroso\u2019s successor, Jean-Claude Juncker. One suspects this entertaining affair is going nowhere.</p> <h2>PPI saga runs and runs</h2> <p>Is there anyone in the country who only just heard it is possible to claim compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI)? Plenty of people, it seems. Complaints to the Financial Ombudsman are still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/06/financial-ombudsman-still-receiving-thousands-of-ppi-complaints\">rolling in at a rate of 3,000 a week</a>.<br></p> <p>Some of these claims will be bogus, of course, as the banks keeping telling us. Not all will be, however, and the volume of complaints should make lenders understand why the Financial Conduct Authority was right to extend its proposed cut-off for claims to June 2019 rather than spring 2018.</p> <p>The principle of a cut-off is sensible because the PPI scandal, which has cost the industry \u00a337bn in claims and administration costs, cannot be allowed to run indefinitely. But legitimate claims still require time for proper consideration. The banks could have helped themselves by handling all claims properly but Lloyds Banking Group, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/04/lloyds-fine-mishandling-ppi-payouts-financial-conduct\">copped a heavy fine</a> on that front last year. Regulatory sympathy will rightly be in short supply even as a few more billions are added to the final PPI bill.</p> <h2>Startup loans come at a price</h2> <p>Here\u2019s a subject for the Treasury select committee to chew over on a rainy day: at what rate is it acceptable for the government to lose money when lending to startup businesses?</p> <p>The question is prompted by the <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/start-loans-scheme-sees-almost-122446202.html\">Press Association\u2019s revelation</a>, via a freedom of information request, that 31% of the loans distributed by the government-backed startup loan scheme have been written off or are in arrears. In hard money, bad debts are \u00a372.4m out of \u00a3232m lent.</p> <p>In the commercial world, a bank would be on its knees if such a high proportion of loans, carrying an interest rate of 6%, failed. For this scheme, 31% is deemed perfectly acceptable: the ceiling rate for defaults is set at 40%.</p> <p>Indeed, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy goes further, arguing the loans are \u201ccreating thousands of jobs and generating a return on investment to the economy of \u00a33 for every \u00a31 spent.\u201d That calculation, of course, deploys a very liberal definition of returns to include payroll taxes and the like.</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s fine if you are pursuing a policy goal of filling a gap in the market left by conventional banks, which was the justification for the launch of the scheme in 2012. All the same, discipline in lending is still meant to part of the mix. The line is thin between giving entrepreneurs a boost and throwing public money at worthy but unviable ventures. A default rate of 31% seems alarmingly high.</p>",

  "<p>There is a sinister airbrushing of history in Woody Allen\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Society (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/11/cafe-society-review-woody-allen-kristen-stewart-jesse-eisenberg\" title=\"\">Review</a>, G2, 2 September). In the 1930s, Hollywood and New York would have been full of black people \u2013 bussing tables, cleaning cars, serving drinks and cleaning houses. Yes, the presence of this army of workers, whose parents or grandparents would have been freed slaves, might have made us a little uncomfortable, but the lushness of 1930s cafe society would not have been possible without them. In Allen\u2019s movie we only saw black people in the two late-night-jazz-club scenes, where they provided decorative trumpet-playing cameos \u2013 rather like the now cringe-making statuettes that can still be bought at flea markets.</p> <p>My grandfather, Sam Minnis, was a member of that army of black workers who upheld 1930s cafe society. I have an old photograph of him with his strikingly handsome face, white tuxedo and bow tie polishing glasses behind an art deco bar. Sam and the rest of that workforce should have been represented in any true nostalgia trip into 1930s cafe society \u2013 even just as the shadowy figures the white majority tried to make of them back then. It is incredibly sad that, with our 21st-century tastes, we would rather not see them at all.<br><strong>Helen Minnis</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p>",

Jos\u00e9 Manuel took the role after an 18-month restriction period following the end of his term at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission\">European commission</a>, a longer period than that imposed by most European institutions.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cJos\u00e9 Manuel\u2019s experience and advice in this time of uncertainty will be extremely valuable to our clients and their reaction to his appointment at Goldman Sachs has been very encouraging.\u201d</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> will be represented at this year\u2019s Miss World contest by a woman with a Japanese mother and Indian father after Priyanka Yoshikawa became the country\u2019s second mixed-race contestant in a row chosen for a major international pageant.<br></p> <p>The qualified elephant trainer who counts kickboxing among her hobbies said she would use her title to promote greater inclusiveness in Japan where, according to government statistics, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C4%81fu\"><em>haafu</em></a> \u2013 those born with one non-Japanese parent \u2013 comprised 2% of all children born in 2012.</p> <p>The 22-year-old Yoshikawa, who was born in Tokyo but also spent some of her childhood in India and the US, praised <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Miyamoto\">Ariana Miyamoto</a>, who won Miss Universe Japan in 2015, for giving her the confidence to enter Miss World.</p> <p>Miyamoto, the child of a Japanese mother and African American father, endured a racist backlash on social media, with some asking why the title had not been awarded to a \u201cpure\u201d Japanese, although many other commenters celebrated her victory.</p> <p>\u201cBefore Ariana, <em>haafu</em> girls couldn\u2019t represent Japan,\u201d Yoshikawa told AFP after winning the title in Tokyo on Monday night. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought too. I didn\u2019t doubt it or challenge it until this day. Ariana encouraged me a lot by showing me and showing all mixed girls the way.\u201d</p> <p>Yoshikawa said her background did not disqualify her or other mixed race people from representing Japan. \u201cWe are Japanese,\u201d she said. \u201cYes I\u2019m half Indian and people are asking me about my purity \u2013 yes my dad is Indian and I\u2019m proud of it, I\u2019m proud that I have Indian in me. But that does not mean I\u2019m not Japanese.\u201d</p> <p>Miyamoto, who was born and raised in Nagasaki, complained in 2015 that she had been bullied as a child for looking different. \u201cIn school people used to throw rubbish at me,\u201d she said in an <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/25/asia/japans-biracial-beauty-queen/\">interview</a> with CNN. \u201cThey also used racial slurs.\u201d</p> <p>Some social media users questioned her right to represent Japan, with one saying that her title was a \u201ccontradiction\u201d given her parentage.</p> <p>The response to Yoshikawa\u2019s victory was more muted, although some Twitter users wondered if a \u201cpure\u201d Japanese contestant would ever win the title. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of holding a pageant like this now? Zero national characteristics,\u201d one poster said. Another complained: \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re saying a pure Japanese face can\u2019t be a winner.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Indian embassy in Tokyo congratulated Yoshikawa on her victory, which entitles her to represent Japan at the Miss World contest in Washington in December.</p> <p>Yoshikawa said she was confident she could challenge the perception that mixed race children are not quite Japanese enough. \u201cWe have problems, we\u2019ve been struggling and it hurts,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I came back to Japan everyone thought I was a germ \u2026 like if they touched me they would be touching something bad. But I\u2019m thankful because that made me really strong.</p> <p>\u201cAs Miss Japan, hopefully I can help change perceptions so that it can be the same here too. The number of people with mixed race is only going to increase, so people have to accept it.\u201d</p> <p>Japanese children born to international marriages were also in evidence at the Rio Olympics. They included Mashu Baker, who took gold in the men\u2019s under-90kg judo, and Aska Cambridge, who was part of Japan\u2019s silver medal-winning men\u2019s 4x100m relay team.</p>"
