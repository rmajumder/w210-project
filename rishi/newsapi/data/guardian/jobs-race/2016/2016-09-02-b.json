  "<p>As an infectious disease physician, scanning breaking news headlines for stories about Zika is a work-related hobby. The latest bit of bad news to cross the wire, on Thursday, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/zika-virus-found-mosquitoes-miami-beach\">the confirmation</a> that mosquitoes in Miami Beach harbor the Zika virus. </p> <p>Reading this announcement, the general public might rightly be pessimistic about the medical community\u2019s ability to cope with emerging infectious diseases \u2013 Zika just seems to keep on spreading. However, despite <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/zika-virus-bill-funding\">the politicization of the disease</a> and the difficulties individual local health agencies may have marshaling resources, the scientific community\u2019s response so far has actually been a resounding success. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/08/zika-doctor-pregnant-women-obgyn-florida\">I\u2019m treating pregnant women with Zika and this is what it\u2019s like | Christine Curry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the span of less than a year, the scientific and medical worlds have moved at a breakneck speed, probably not seen since the dawn of the HIV pandemic, to not only unravel the mysteries of this virus but to provide a pathway to ultimately extinguish its ability to threaten our species. </p> <p>When Zika, a virus believed for decades to be almost entirely benign, appeared for the first time in the western hemisphere, it coincided with a remarkable spike in numbers of newborns with microcephaly, a devastating and extremely costly condition that leads to cognitive impairment, developmental delays and early death. This sort of brain damage was never before associated with Zika, or with any disease like it. </p> <p>A major scientific endeavor \u2013 and indeed the driving force behind the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) quick declaration of a public health emergency \u2013 was required to establish whether these two events were merely correlated, or if a causal relationship existed. In a remarkably short span of time, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) put Zika through <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1604338#t=article\">Shepard\u2019s criteria</a>, a rigorous series of steps used to establish causation for fetal abnormalities like microcephaly. A similar establishment of causality was made for Zika\u2019s role in the autoimmune neurologic disorder Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Concurrently, separate efforts to develop a vaccine effective against Zika flourished, leading to at least two candidate vaccines (with more to follow) <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12047994/zika-virus-possible-vaccine-successful-mice-trials\">already moving</a> into human trials. Laboratory diagnostics for Zika, which were virtually non-existent a year ago, are now available all over the world and will probably become even more refined and accessible after the WHO took steps to internationally standardize the strain of Zika used in research and development this week. </p> <p>It is crucial to realize that these diagnostic tests have not yet been formally licensed for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but have been made available through Emergency Use Authorizations. These emergency authorizations are the result of important legislation that emphasized the absolute need to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles in the midst of a public health emergency. </p> <p>Indeed, a whole portion of the FDA \u2013 the Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats \u2013 was created years ago for just this very reason, and this office\u2019s efforts in prior emergencies, such as the 2009 flu pandemic and the 2014 Ebola outbreak, altered the course of those outbreaks for the better.</p> <p>More basic scientific questions have also been probed by multiple research groups and have revealed the virus\u2019s proclivity for traversing the placenta to reach the fetus, and the molecular pathways the immune system uses to combat the virus\u2019s attack. This week, researchers also found that we may be able to repurpose a tapeworm medication to fight Zika, which would fast-track the process of delivering the drug to the market, because it is already approved by the FDA. </p> <p>With each outbreak, leaders in the fields of infectious disease and public health preparedness become more skilled as they integrate the lessons of the past into their knowledge base. The flourishing of the human species is directly related to our ability to minimize the impacts of these threats. </p> <p>There is a tendency with every outbreak of disease to see the litany of negative headlines and hear the hoof beats of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The burden caused by Zika, thus far, has been sizable, and for those families in which a pregnancy was affected, incalculable. </p> <p>However, the historic scientific and medical advances that have characterized the response to the Zika outbreak show the profound advancement of modern science, and ultimately how far we have come in confronting global threats of disease.</p>",

  "<p>One of the many stories about Charles de Gaulle concerns a tour he made of France after the liberation in 1944. Some of the people who turned out to cheer him preferred to forget they\u2019d been applauding his predecessor Marshal P\u00e9tain only a few months earlier. On one such parade, someone in the crowd was heard to shout, \u201c<em>Vive le Mar\u00e9chal!</em>\u201d De Gaulle is supposed to have turned to a colleague and said: \u201cAnother woman who doesn\u2019t read the papers.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/31/coronation-street-apologises-complaints-itv-eva-price\">Coronation Street apologises as nearly 300 complain about 'racist' remark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Surprisingly in 2016, it seems there are still plenty of people around, including in the media itself, who don\u2019t read the papers, watch the news or keep up with current events. If they did, they wouldn\u2019t get into the kind of controversy that Coronation Street has found itself in this week.</p> <p>It should be pretty obvious to everyone by now that some of us were going to take exception to character <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/31/coronation-street-apologises-complaints-itv-eva-price\" title=\"\">Eva Price\u2019s remark</a>, apropos of her dyed blond hair, \u201cI\u2019ve got more roots than Kunta Kinte\u201d, which was followed up with: \u201cNo idea who that is, by the way, just something my mum used to say.\u201d Coronation Street was quick to offer the usual pro-forma apology issued in these situations but it\u2019s depressing that it went all the way from a scriptwriter to production without any of the creatives involved noticing. Even if Eva Price and her mum don\u2019t get it, you would expect TV people to have a handle on why those lines were a very bad idea.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult now to remember just how groundbreaking <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075572/\" title=\"\">Roots</a> was when it first appeared on TV back in 1977. As a kid who was only used to seeing black characters as figures of fun in sitcoms, this epic historical drama was a landmark for my generation of black youth. Not only were black characters presented as fully rounded people, it was the first real attempt to present the story of slavery in something like an accurate dramatic form. It was great rather than worthy TV, and it wasn\u2019t given a graveyard slot either. In the US, over <a href=\"http://www.museum.tv/eotv/roots.htm\" title=\"\">100 million viewers tuned in</a>. Perhaps the people involved in Coronation Street are too young to remember the original Roots and its impact. But you would have thought they would have noticed the History Channel\u2019s critically acclaimed, slightly reimagined, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/24/malachi-kirby-on-remaking-roots-kunta-kinte-i-could-feel-the-pain-hear-the-screams\" title=\"\">remake</a> earlier this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3e31904a9a1939746f79144371eda085d2923666\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e31904a9a1939746f79144371eda085d2923666/0_14_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LeVar Burton as Kunta Kinte in the 1977 TV adaptation of Roots\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s difficult now to remember just how groundbreaking Roots was when it first appeared on TV back in 1977.\u2019 LeVar Burton as Kunta Kinte in the 1977 TV adaptation of Roots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC Photo Archives/ABC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the reasons why America produces so much compelling TV and film is that those involved in it do at least seem to be aware of what\u2019s going on around them. To some extent, Roots was a response to the rise of civil rights and an attempt to engage dramatically with the racial divide in the US, the country\u2019s great \u201cunsolved crime\u201d, and its history.</p> <p>In contemporary America this work is still going on. While the US is engulfed by bitter controversy about police shootings of black men and the rise of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter movement</a>, its film and TV doesn\u2019t ignore its historical backdrop. The drama series Underground and Sundance movie smash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/26/the-birth-of-a-nation-review-sundance-slavery-epic-as-brutal-as-braveheart\" title=\"\">The Birth of a Nation</a> being only the latest examples.</p> <p>Not everyone is entirely convinced by this genre. As one black friend of mine put it: \u201cAll right, we get it; slavery was a bad thing.\u201d But that\u2019s to ignore the fact that human evil and the response to it, for better or worse, is always going to make for gripping stories.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For many black women, our hair has helped us to reclaim our cultural identity and redefine notions of beauty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The notion that someone would think it\u2019s acceptable for a white, female character to trivialise Kunta Kinte as she talks about her hair roots is also out of kilter with how many black women have been using their natural hair roots on a journey of political and social expression. For many black women, myself included, our hair has helped us to reclaim our cultural identity and redefine notions of beauty. This is captured in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AmDLsbK2Zs\" title=\"\">great scene</a> in How To get Away With Murder, where Viola Davis rips off her wig to reveal her natural hair, making black women worldwide punch the air.</p> <p>But apparently in the UK, we\u2019re still waiting to catch up when it comes to reflecting contemporary reality. It might be unfair to pick on Coronation Street specifically, but in the past, people have noticed that the show seems very white for a drama that uses modern urban England as its setting. And in general, while there\u2019s a lot of angst about making TV programmes that aren\u2019t quite so white and middle-class, there has been little actual progress in addressing this. No one wants to see well meaning (if leaden) attempts to shoehorn \u201cissues\u201d into drama. But a quick glance at the papers will at least mean that in future Coronation Street won\u2019t be doing Kunta Kinte gags either.</p>",

She is concerned that there may be supporters of BLM \u201csitting on the sidelines\u201d because they equate activism only with protest.</p> <p>\u201cThat really is our work \u2013 to make sure that the movement is everywhere \u2026 in hospitals and healthcare, in schools, in our workplaces, in our churches,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to really accelerate the pace of the change that we seek. </p> <p>\u201cThat is the beauty and the burden, in some ways, of a movement like this: there\u2019s so much to be done, and it always feels like there\u2019s not enough time to do any of it.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps because of the commitment she says she\u2019s prepared to shoulder, Garza, now 35, is scathing of those who have contributed less than they could have. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ll put it this way,\u201d she says, when asked about her perceptions of Obama\u2019s eight years as president. \u201cI\u2019ve learned much more about politics than I thought I ever would.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You\u2019re never going to get a compromise.

You can\u2019t compromise on somebody\u2019s life \u2013 you just can\u2019t.\u201d She laughs.</p> <p>\u201cLike, what are we doing? \u2018If you shoot me in the leg, instead of shooting me in the head, that\u2019s better\u2019? No!\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s required is leadership \u2013 and action, says Garza. \u201cSomebody needs to say, \u2018You know what? This has to stop. We cannot continue to have police kill with impunity and not face any consequences, and so therefore what I\u2019m going to do is x, y, z, d, e, f, g.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She rattles off a list of practical steps that would help BLM achieve its aims, such as defunding police departments with a track record of violence, introducing a national training standard for officers, and mandating psychiatric testing. </p> <p>Internationally, she points to economic sanctions imposed on apartheid South Africa and Cuba for its communist regime as evidence of how nation-states can show more leadership.</p> <p>From her previous visit to Australia and speaking to activists there, she felt that the over-representation of Indigenous people in prisons and poverty drew a range of responses: one being \u201calmost complete denial\u201d, and another, \u201clike ad campaigns: \u2018Let\u2019s all be together\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWithout changing the laws or improving people\u2019s condition, those ads campaigns are for nothing \u2026 There\u2019s got to be something beyond dialogue to change the way we do things.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">The Counted: people killed by police in the United States \u2013 interactive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But leadership doesn\u2019t necessarily go hand in hand with popularity. Obama \u201cseems like a fair guy\u201d, says Garza \u2013 probably why he has such high approval ratings, she adds, a touch archly. </p> <p>\u201cBut after he got elected again, and he can\u2019t run again, I\u2019m like, \u2018What have you got to lose, dude?\u2019\u201d She laughs, adding: \u201cWhy not go out grand?\u201d</p> <p>Even with just 140 days until 20 January, his last day in office, she is hopeful that he has a final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/may/02/obama-out-mic-drop-white-house-correspondents-dinner\">mic drop</a> in the works that will reverberate with real impact. </p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly and counterintuitively, Garza has low expectations of and is also less anxious about the stakes in this year\u2019s contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cYou either participate and hold your nose, or you will not participate at all, or you will participate and vote for a third party \u2013 there\u2019s lots of ways to go.\u201d While she will herself vote, Garza says, \u201cwhat\u2019s clear, with either of these candidates, their presidency will have impact on people\u2019s lives, but it won\u2019t necessarily be radically different from the other presidents before them. That\u2019s one thing we can count on.<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not in any way under any illusion that there is a vote that I can cast that\u2019s going to get me what I want.\u201d</p>"
