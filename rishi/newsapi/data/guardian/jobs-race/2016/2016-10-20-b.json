However, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/01/film-and-race\">other ethnic minorities were markedly underrepresented</a>, most notably Hispanics and Asians.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-press-release-new-bfi-research-reveals-representation-of-black-actors-in-film-2016-10-06.pdf\">A recent BFI study (pdf) found</a> that in the British film industry, 13% of films featured at least one black actor in a leading role and 41% featured at least one black actor in a named character role. At the last census in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/articles/ethnicityandnationalidentityinenglandandwales/2012-12-11\">3% of the UK\u2019s population was black</a>, although the proportions are higher in cities and rise to <a href=\"https://data.london.gov.uk/census/themes/diversity/\">as high as 13.3% in London</a>.</p> <p>The BFI\u2019s creative director, Heather Stewart, used a symposium at the London film festival to call for more diversity and roles for black actors in British film. \u201cThe number of lead roles for black actors has not really changed over 10 years,\u201d she said, \u201cand the types of films in which they have had leading roles suggests stereotyping. Colour-blind casting across genres does not really exist on the big screen, ultimately limiting representation.</p> <p>\u201cDiversity is one of the biggest issues facing film \u2013 audiences want to see the world in which we live reflected back at them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47832578620c09117f1d9591de5ea676dc44141e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47832578620c09117f1d9591de5ea676dc44141e/0_0_1600_1060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael K Williams as Omar in The Wire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael K Williams as Omar in The Wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The public poll</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Sidney Poitier</strong> (In the Heat of the Night, 1967)<br></li> <li><strong>Pam Grier</strong> (Jackie Brown, 1997)<br></li> <li><strong>Michael K Williams</strong> (The Wire, 2002-08)<br></li> <li><strong>Chiwetel Ejiofor</strong> (12 Years a Slave, 2013)<br></li> <li><strong>Morgan Freeman</strong> (The Shawshank Redemption, 1994)<br></li> <li><strong>Samuel L Jackson</strong> (Pulp Fiction, 1994)<br></li> <li><strong>Denzel Washington</strong> (Malcolm X, 1992)<br></li> <li><strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong> (The Color Purple, 1985)<br></li> <li><strong>Angela Bassett</strong> (What\u2019s Love Got to Do with It, 1993)<br></li> <li><strong>Sidney Poitier</strong> (Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner, 1967)</li> </ol>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40a9f39502bce593504074437531525de249ce84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40a9f39502bce593504074437531525de249ce84/86_166_1763_1058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Bassett plays Tina Turner in What\u2019s Love Got To Do With It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Critics\u2019 choice \u2026 Angela Bassett plays Tina Turner in What\u2019s Love Got To Do With It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Touchstone</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The industry poll</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Angela Bassett</strong> (What\u2019s Love Got to Do with It, 1993) </li> <li><strong>Pam Grier</strong> (Jackie Brown, 1997) </li> <li><strong>Sidney Poitier</strong> (In the Heat of the Night, 1967) </li> <li><strong>Denzel Washington</strong> (Malcolm X, 1992) </li> <li><strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong> (The Color Purple, 1985) </li> <li><strong>Chiwetel Ejiofor</strong> (12 Years a Slave, 2013) </li> <li><strong>Juanita Moore</strong> (Imitation of Life, 1959) </li> <li><strong>Dorothy Dandridge</strong> (Carmen Jones, 1954) </li> <li><strong>Marianne Jean-Baptiste</strong> (Secrets and Lies, 1997) </li> <li><strong>Danny Glover</strong> (To Sleep with Anger, 1990) </li> </ol> <p>The full results <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/black-star/best-black-star-performances-all-time-poll\">can be seen on the BFI site</a>.<br></p>",

On average, premiums have <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">risen</a> by about 5.8% a year since Barack Obama took office, compared with 13.2% in the nine years before Obama, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/\">Politifact found</a> earlier this year. Trump, however, is cherry-picking data from <a href=\"http://acasignups.net/\">various states</a> and <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX19n4kcCdR5qUI27%2BwHheoDO2VGbcEEfi84Zrt9YzdawzO8%2BdPHtCLfThVI4mtetRmr28iQ8w29yvQ%3D%3D\">providers</a> where <a href=\"https://ratereview.healthcare.gov/#urrresults?U2FsdGVkX186EmjG4AR6ruydOJE2fGfzzCgpYCDVKZngFNf0hgLfrIhE%2BJuoUQjwImgHKotCy9LrONfdtvsk4im1VSMZcQCpaU3VHLZUiPU%3D\">rates have had higher</a> jumps. The most common healthcare plans will increase 9% on average, according to an <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/\">analysis</a> by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWe take care of illegal immigrants \u2026 better than we take care of our vets\u201d</strong></p> <p>This claim flies in the face of evidence and logic. Like all US citizens, veterans enjoy the basic rights and benefits granted by US law (voting rights, social security, Medicaid, etc), while undocumented migrants (noncitizens) do not. Trump has in the past tried to justify this claim by saying the US spends more on undocumented people than on veterans, but has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/lyin-trump-fact-check-mexico-wall-immigration\"> drawn a $113bn price tag from an explicitly anti-immigration foundation</a>. He also inflated that number. </p> <p>The campaign has said the US spends $2.8bn on housing migrants in prisons, combining an estimate <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421673/report-us-spent-187-billion-incarcerate-illegal-immigrant-criminals-2014-joel-gehrke\">on prison costs</a> and the 2016 budget for the care and processing of children who came to the US without adults. The Veterans Affairs administration has a 2016 budget of $69.7bn. Veterans and undocumented migrants alike have access to K-12 education, though few veterans would likely seek it, and veterans have access to the Affordable Care Act, military benefits and health benefits, while migrants do not.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cOur inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store, you have no education, no jobs\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump\u2019s repeated claim that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-lies-this-week-taxes-bankruptcy\">African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell</a>\u201d defies most of American history, from antebellum slavery through the Jim Crow decades, great depression and segregation. Even if Trump is only referring the past half century, he is still wrong by most metrics. </p> <p>Data on employment, education and health show empirical evidence for the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/18/sharp-differences-over-who-is-hurt-helped-by-their-race/\">persistent reality</a> of <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/27/blacks-with-college-experience-more-likely-to-say-they-faced-discrimination/\">discrimination</a> against black Americans, but also show major gains in the last few decades. In 2015, black people earned just 75% as much as whites in median hourly earnings, whether full- or part-time, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/\">according to a Pew Research</a> analysis.

During the FBI investigation, Petraeus lied to agents, according to the plea deal.

The IHRC approved a project between the US, Haiti\u2019s government and Sae-A Trading, a South Korean clothing company, and it now provides 8,900 jobs to Haitians.</p> <p>An eventual <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655278.pdf\">review</a> by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found \u201cmixed results\u201d with the project, including \u201cunrealistic initial timeframes\u201d, delays, incomplete information in the feasibility study, and funding problems.

The US committed funding but did not participate in building the industrial park; a labor group that reviewed the factory found it had <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwiJbAWhwPe_U3pDTkpMVmhNdFQ4NWZPR3VsSTNnVEtmVGJF/view\">adequate oversight and had dealt </a>with concerns, though the factory remains within the range of the often grueling garment industry.</p> <p>He was correct, at least, that the Clinton Foundation has accepted millions from Middle East countries with records of repression of women and gay people. <br></p> <p><strong>Clinton: \u201cWe at the Clinton Foundation spend 90% [of what\u2019s given] and have the highest rating from watchdogs\u201d</strong></p> <p>The Clinton Foundation does have high marks from charity watchdogs, which also show that the group does spend the vast majority of its donations on its own charitable programs.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t buy boats, I don\u2019t buy planes [with the Trump Foundation], we put up the American flag, and that\u2019s it \u2026 We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump is not being wholly honest about his charitable foundation, at least according to the Trump Foundation own documents, which <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html\">show that he used its money to pay for legal settlements</a> and even self-portraits, as Clinton said and<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-clue-to-the-whereabouts-of-the-6-foot-tall-portrait-of-donald-trump/2016/09/14/ae65db82-7a8f-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html\"> the Washington Post </a>has reported at length.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58082834e4b055209adaf5ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T02:13:32.369Z\">3.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8fb95e51e74a0970d0460104e4819138c2b4e6d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8fb95e51e74a0970d0460104e4819138c2b4e6d7/0_0_4488_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debate moderator Chris Wallace from Fox News attempts to keep things in control on the stage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debate moderator Chris Wallace from Fox News attempts to keep things in control on the stage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c036bd71431d42bbd7449c533cf244bdde2b038\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c036bd71431d42bbd7449c533cf244bdde2b038/0_74_5069_3043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Wallace has to turn his attention to the crowd who\u2019ve begun cheering and applauding the candidates\u2019 answers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wallace then has to turn his attention to the crowd who\u2019ve begun cheering and applauding the candidates\u2019 answers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T02:15:44.501Z\">at 3.15am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-580827f7e4b0cd26ff71ef68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T02:13:17.809Z\">3.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Question: What to do to ensure that Isis does not re-fill left behind when they are defeated for example imminently in Mosul?</p> <p>Clinton: \u201cI am hopeful that hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off but we know we\u2019ve got lots of hard work to do.\u201d</p> <p>Thousands of civilians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/mosul-thousands-flee-syrian-refugee-camps-iraqi-forces-close-city\">have fled Mosul</a> and its surrounding region to crowded refugee camps in war-torn Syria, aid officials have said, as Iraqi forces continued to advance on the most populous city under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> control.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-580826f1e4b055209adaf5e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-20T02:11:56.212Z\">3.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump: 'I will keep you in suspense'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump says there are millions of people registered to vote who shouldn\u2019t be.

As of 28 September 2016,<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\"> it was $19.5tn</a>. Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy. Pence has the right numbers but imputes too much responsibility on the president.</p> <p><strong>Clinton: Trump\u2019s plan largely helps the wealthy and add $20tn in debt</strong></p> <p>Clinton is correct that although Trump\u2019s tax plan would cut taxes for everyone, it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding $5.3tn to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. She seems to be citing another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, about the debt, and possibly overstates its estimated consequences. </p> <p>That center warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d. According to that group, half of Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1% of earners, and most families below the top 20% of earners would have income gains of less than 1%.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cWhen you ran the State Department, $6bn was missing! Maybe it was stolen \u2026 nobody knows\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is not correct. Trump is alluding to a March 2014 alert, about contractor spending in the Middle East and Africa, by the State Department\u2019s inspector general, who was so perturbed by careless language around the $6bn figure that he wrote the Washington Post a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/about-the-state-depts-missing-6-billion/2014/04/13/a6130790-c194-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html?utm_term=.452a9d665b36\">letter</a> that April.

A Trump contractor hired undocumented Polish workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in 1983 union members sued one of their organizers. Trump appeared in court in 1990 and blamed the contractor overseeing the project, which was for Trump Tower.</p> <p><strong>Trump: Obama \u201chas thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from\u201d</strong></p> <p>Ten thousand Syrian refugees have come to the United States in 2016, but Trump makes it sound misleadingly large.</p> <p>He is patently wrong about the screening process. The US has among the most intensive screening process in the world for refugees: it requires they register and interview with the United Nations, which then must refer them to the US; refugees who pass this test then interview with State Department contractors and have at least two background checks; then they have three fingerprint and photo screenings; then US immigration reviews the case; then Homeland Security interviews the refugee; then a doctor examines the refugee, and finally several security agencies perform one last check after the refugee has been matched with a resettlement agency. </p> <p>The process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">takes 18 months</a> to two years. The US has a very clear idea about which refugees it allows into the country.</p> <p><strong>Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t know Putin. He said nice things about me \u2026 He has no respect for our president.\u201d</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether Trump has ever spoken with the Russian president. Putin was invited to but did not attend a 2013 beauty pageant in Moscow, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html\">one of the oligarchs</a> who helped organize the event. \u201cWill he become my new best friend?\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640\">wondered</a> beforehand.</p> <p>The pair may have communicated through intermediaries. In 2014, Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKkKQmbyECw\">told a National Press Club luncheon</a>: \u201cI was in Moscow recently and I spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin, who could not have been nicer, and we had a tremendous success.\u201d A year earlier, Trump <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-putin-tried-arrange-meeting-moscow-source-n619006\">told MSNBC</a>: \u201cI do have a relationship and I can tell you that he\u2019s very interested in what we\u2019re doing here today.\u201d</p> <p>Last November, Trump <a href=\"http://time.com/4107636/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-the-fourth-republican-debate-in-milwaukee/\">claimed in a debate</a> that he \u201cgot to know him very well because we were both on 60 Minutes\u201d. They appeared in separate, pre-taped segments and were not on set together.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly tried to do business in Russia, and his refusal to release tax returns prevents him proving that he has no assets there. </p> <p>Putin has never called Trump \u201ca genius\u201d; he used the Russian word \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439, which means \u201ccolorful\u201d or \u201cflamboyant\u201d. Trump likely heard the word translated as \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cbrilliant\u201d, though its connotations are often more pejorative than not: bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy, brilliant in the sense of dazzling light. Putin also called him \u201ctalented, undoubtedly\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our business to decide his merits; that\u2019s for US voters,\u201d Putin said earlier this year. He did say, however, that he would welcome the rapprochement in Russian-American relations that Trump has suggested.

Post-debate analysis comes to mind. Also, pre-debate analysis. Every description in advance of what we expect to happen onstage \u2013 the candidate chemistry, the tone, the issues they must surely discuss \u2013 those predictions seem unfailingly to miss. </p> <p>So let\u2019s give it another whirl. What will they discuss tonight? Moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News will have questions cued to the six topic areas announced in advance: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, the supreme court, foreign hotspots and fitness to be president.</p> <p>But the candidates\u2019 preferred messages in recent days, especially as Trump is concerned, touch on different themes. Trump has been talking a lot about a rigged election and promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of Washington. In recent days he has proposed ethics reform laws and congressional term limits. Meanwhile, Breitbart, Trump\u2019s phantom media arm, published today (for the first time, it seems) the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/former-tv-reporter-accuses-bill-clinton-of-sexual-assault-229987\">story</a> of a former Arkansas broadcaster, Leslie Milwee, who says Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980. She\u2019s invited to the debate.</p> <p>Trump says that Clinton emails released by Wikileaks show she is part of an international cabal, with banks and the media, to destroy the country and enrich and empower themselves. He has contended that the state department offered the FBI a quid pro quo for declassifying certain Clinton emails just as they were to come in for public scrutiny. Any of these would-be scandals might be expected to come up.</p> <p>Clinton, for her part, may want to discuss the attack by Trump on his Republican colleagues; Trump\u2019s increasingly wild talk about voter fraud; or the astounding outpouring since the last debate of women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or assault. (He denies all the claims.)

It\u2019s hard to feel excited or even relieved, though, when her road to victory is so slick with the odium of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Between the video of Trump bragging about sexual assault and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/15/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-cathy-heller\">woman after woman</a> coming forward to claim he did just that, it\u2019s hard to stave off that sick-to-your-stomach feeling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/14/michelle-obama-speech-transcript-donald-trump\">Michelle Obama described so powerfully last week</a>. For those of us who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/jessica-valenti-my-life-as-a-sex-object\">endured a lifetime of unwanted leers and touches</a>, this last leg of the campaign has been painful. And as Trump surrogates and supporters \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/melania-trump-billy-bush-groping-tape-cnn-interview\">even his wife</a> \u2013 continue to shrug off the offenses as \u201clocker room talk\u201d or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787990502415167488\">outright lies</a>, we\u2019re reminded of just how easily women are disbelieved.</p> <p>There is one thing, though, that\u2019s giving me hope in the midst of this ugliness: the outcry from men who refuse to characterize sexual harassment and abuse as normal male behavior. Too often, discussions about sexual assault center only on women \u2013 our victimization and perceived culpability. Since the tape\u2019s release, though, the national conversation has shifted: men are coming forward en masse to reject the idea that \u201creal men\u201d talk about abusing women \u2013 that this is normal language to use in a locker room or anywhere else.</p> <p>Read further:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-sexism-misogyny-men\">The silver lining of Trump's misogyny?

Fox News anchor Chris Wallace - the first anchor from that network to host a presidential debate - will moderate tonight\u2019s engagement. For a network that has been embroiled in scandal that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-leaves-fox-news-sexual-harassment-claims\">brought down its chief executive</a>, Wallace\u2019s position is an opportunity to hit the reset button on a miserable year - although Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fox-anchor-megyn-kelly-meets-donald-trump\">willingness to feud</a> with Fox News personalities means that Wallace will not be protected from onstage criticism from the candidate just because he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/06/trump-only-goes-on-hannity-megyn-kelly-clashes-with-friend-at-10-oclock\">besties with Sean Hannity.</a></p> <p><strong>What is the format? </strong>The debate will consist of six 15-minute segments, following the same format as the first presidential debate. Each segment will be approximately 15 minutes long. Wallace will open each segment with a question, after which each candidate will have two minutes to respond. Clinton and Trump will then have an opportunity to respond to each other. Wallace may use the balance of the time in the segment for a deeper discussion of the topic. Those topics, <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2016debates\">as revealed by the Commission on Presidential Debates</a>, are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Debt and entitlements</li> <li>Immigration</li> <li>The economy</li> <li>Supreme Court</li> <li>Foreign hot spots</li> <li>Fitness to be president</li> </ul> <p><strong>Where is the debate being held? </strong>The debate is being held at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which means that the journalists covering the debate are going to come home broke and hung over (they\u2019ve earned it, trust me).</p> <p><strong>How do I watch the misery? </strong>That\u2019s the easy part!

States vary on how late they allow abortions \u2013 in some states there have been attempts to introduce very short time limits, including in North Dakota where a proposal in 2013 for a ban six weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period was ruled unconstitutional, but in most states the time limit is at the start of the third trimester or earlier. There are nine states without specific term prohibitions, but clinics do not abort at such late terms: only 1.2% of abortions occur after 21 weeks, according to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute.</p> <p><strong>\u201cClinton wants open borders\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton does not want \u201copen borders\u201d: she supports reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the US, and she supports Obama\u2019s executive actions to shield some migrants, such as people who were brought to the US as children. Like Obama, she supports deportation for people with criminal records.</p> <p><strong>\u201cObama has moved millions of people out\u201d</strong></p> <p>Trump is correct: Barack Obama has deported more than 2.5 million people, more than any other recent president, but he has prioritized migrants with criminal records. \u201cMillions and millions\u201d, however, is an exaggeration, and Obama also supports shielding millions of undocumented immigrants without criminal records, and reform for citizenship.</p> <p><strong>Obama \u201chas thousands and thousands of people, they have no idea where they come from\u201d<br></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\" data-alt=\"membership callout\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/us-membership/defy.html\">membership callout</a> </figure>  <p>Ten thousand Syrian refugees have come to the United States in 2016, but Trump makes it sound misleadingly large.</p> <p>He is patently wrong about the screening process.

Trump likely heard the word translated as \u201cbright\u201d or \u201cbrilliant\u201d, though its connotations are often more pejorative than not: bright in the sense of glaring and gaudy, brilliant in the sense of dazzling light.

The US <a href=\"http://www.act.nato.int/nsip\">currently pays</a> about 22% of overall Nato spending, compared to Germany\u2019s 15%, France\u2019s 11%, the UK\u2019s 10%, etc, and most Nato members <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_01/20160129_160128-pr-2016-11-eng.pdf\">fail to pay the 2% of GDP</a> into defense as the alliance\u2019s guidelines dictate.

As of 28 September 2016,<a href=\"http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current\"> it was $19.5tn</a>. Trump omits, however, two key points: Congress controls the government\u2019s wallet (ie Obama cannot spend or tax without approval from lawmakers), and Obama took office during the financial crisis, when Republicans, Democrats and most economists agreed that the US needed to spend in order to counteract the collapsing economy. Pence has the right numbers but imputes too much responsibility on the president.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWhen you ran the state department, $6bn was missing! Maybe it was stolen \u2026 nobody knows\u201d</strong></p> <p>This is not correct. Trump is alluding to a March 2014 alert, about contractor spending in the Middle East and Africa, by the state department\u2019s inspector general, who was so perturbed by careless language around the $6bn figure that he wrote the Washington Post a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/about-the-state-depts-missing-6-billion/2014/04/13/a6130790-c194-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html?utm_term=.452a9d665b36\">letter</a> that April. His alert did not conclude that the money was \u201cmissing\u201d he told the Post, but rather that officials had failed \u201cto adequately maintain contract files\u201d that created \u201csignificant financial risk\u201d.

During the FBI investigation, Petraeus lied to agents, according to the plea deal. But the justice department only sentenced Petraeus to two years\u2019 probation and a $100,000 fine, provoking accusations that this relatively lenient sentence was evidence of a double standard for the powerful. The justice department\u2019s lenience toward Petraeus actually made it more difficult, in part, for prosecutors to recommend charges against Clinton.<br><br>This week Cartwright pled guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation into leaking classified information about operations against Iran to journalists. Like Petraeus, though, the FBI found actual intentional wrongdoing in Cartwright\u2019s case.

A Trump contractor hired undocumented Polish workers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in 1983 union members sued one of their organizers. Trump appeared in court in 1990 and blamed the contractor overseeing the project, which was for Trump Tower.</p> <p><strong>\u201cI will not add a penny to the debt\u201d</strong></p> <p>Estimates suggest Clinton is not wholly correct.

The Tax Policy Center, however, estimates that she would <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals\">add $1.1tn in revenue</a> in a decade, though much of that would be offset by increased spending. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump\u2019s plan would add <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/09/26/donald-trump-would-boost-debt-more-than-hillary-clinton-report-says/\">$5.3tn to the debt</a>.</p> <p><strong>\u201cWe at the Clinton Foundation spend 90% [of what\u2019s given] and have the highest rating from watchdogs\u201d</strong></p> <p>The Clinton Foundation does have high marks from charity watchdogs, which also show that the group does spend the vast majority of its donations on its own charitable programs.</p> <p><strong>Clinton says Trump has called the election \u2018rigged\u2019, while Trump says he won\u2019t necessarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/oct/19/donald-trump-accept-election-result-debate-video\">accept the election results</a></strong></p> <p>All available evidence shows that in-person voter fraud is exceedingly rare: you are more likely to be struck by lightning in the next year (<a href=\"http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml\">a one in 1,042,000 chance</a>, according to Noaa) than to find a case of voter fraud by impersonation (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/\">31 possible cases in more than a billion ballots cast</a> from 2000 to 2014, according to a study by Loyola Law School).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/17/man-who-cried-rigged-problem-with-trump-election-claims\">The man who cried rigged: the problem with Trump\u2019s election claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Voter fraud would have to happen on an enormous scale to sway elections, because the electoral college system decentralizes authority: each of the 50 states has its own rules and local officials, not federal ones, run the polls and count the ballots. This complexity makes the notion of a \u201crigged\u201d national election, at least in the US, logistically daunting to the point of practical impossibility. Thirty-one states have Republican governors, including the swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Ohio; Pennsylvania only elected a Democratic governor in 2015. Polls show Trump losing even in some states where governors have strongly supported him. In Maine, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/me/maine_trump_vs_clinton-5896.html\">the Real Clear Politics average</a> shows him down five points.</p> <p>About <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/09/technology/voting-machine-hack-election/\">75% of the ballots cast </a>in federal elections have paper backups, and most electronic voting machines are not connected to the internet \u2013 though they have other flaws and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rigged-presidential-elections-hackers-demonstrate-voting-threat-old-machines/\">may be vulnerable </a>to tampering. But voter fraud to swing a major election, whether by tampering, buying votes or official wrongdoing, would quickly attract attention <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/08/05/donald-trump-is-wrong-rigging-an-election-is-almost-impossible/?utm_term=.e3b72d4ba7ff\">by its necessarily large scale</a>.</p> <p>If Trump loses the presidential election, it will be because American voters do not want him in the White House, not because of a conspiracy involving Republicans and Democrats alike at state and city levels around the nation \u2013 a conspiracy for which Trump has provided no evidence.</p> <p><strong>\u201cTrump\u2019s plan largely helps the wealthy and adds $20tn in debt\u201d</strong></p> <p>Clinton is correct that although Trump\u2019s tax plan would cut taxes for everyone, it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/08/donald-trump-tax-plan-business-income-middle-class\">disproportionately help the wealthiest Americans</a>, saving them millions of dollars and adding $5.3tn to the national debt, <a href=\"http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-plan-september-2016\">according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, a conservative thinktank. She seems to be citing another <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan\">analysis, by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, about the debt, and possibly overstates its estimated consequences.</p> <p>That center warned that without severe spending cuts, the plan would balloon national debt \u201cby nearly 80% of gross domestic product by 2036, offsetting some or all of the incentive effects of the tax cuts\u201d. According to that group, half of Trump\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1% of earners, and most families below the top 20% of earners would have income gains of less than 1%.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 October 2016.

I don\u2019t want to be unkind, but sometimes maybe if you\u2019re just fine at your gig and have been doing it for a while, it\u2019s OK for your employer to want to shake things up a little bit, especially when they\u2019re not actually terminating you mid-contract, and in Hughes-Games\u2019s case, when you\u2019re not actually being fired at all. And you know what? It\u2019s OK if your employer wants to shake things up by hiring a woman or someone from an ethnic minority who can be a woman and a person of colour and simultaneously good at the job. It is possible. This assumption that white men are uniquely qualified and will only be replaced by an incompetent who is only going to get on by virtue of their gender or colour is not only wrong, but maddeningly ironic. The magic combination of maleness and whiteness are still, by an incalculable quantum, likely to turbo-boost any career, even those of mediocrities.</p>",
