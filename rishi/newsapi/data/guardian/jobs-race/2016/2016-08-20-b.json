  "<p>No bottle of hair dye could possibly hold as much history as Clairol nice \u2019n easy, No 512, a shade of dark auburn launched in 1975. The extraordinary face on the side of its bottle belonged to Tracey Norman, one of the first African American models to make it big and the second black woman, after Beverly Johnson, to appear on the cover of&#xa0;<em>Vogue</em>.</p> <p>By the time her large eyes and sharp cheekbones became the face of No 512, Norman\u2019s career was booming and her shade became a bestseller soon after its launch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/14/laverne-cox-orange-new-black-transgender\" title=\"\">Laverne Cox, best known for her role in the TV series <em>Orange is the New Black</em></a>, remembers Norman\u2019s face on that bottle, as do many other millions of American women. As Cox told <em>New York</em> <em>Magazine</em> last year: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many hours I stared at that photo of her on that Clairol bottle and that caption, \u2018Born Beautiful\u2019. Yeah, we are born beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Norman, however, was keeping an extraordinary secret. As a trans woman she was making history, all the while hoping that no one else would ever know. Cox, a trans actor, and every other woman who bought a bottle of No 512, had no idea that the beautiful black woman on the side of the Clairol bottle had begun life as a biological boy. Norman was, in short, the first black transgender model.</p> <p>In recent years, rapid if overdue progress has been made in the realm of trans rights and trans visibility. Now trans models such as Andreja Peji\u0107, Carmen Carrera, Lea T and Hari Nef walk runways and secure campaigns for major fashion labels. Forty years ago, however, the word \u201ctrans\u201d barely existed and prejudice was such that the idea of a trans model being \u201cout\u201d was unthinkable, even horrifying, to a far less enlightened world. As such, Norman would say a prayer before each shoot: \u201cPlease don\u2019t let this be the&#xa0;day.\u201d</p> <p>She \u201cpassed\u201d as a cisgender female for years before that day came around in 1980. Norman was, as she understands it, outed on a shoot and with that, her career was in effect terminated. Now, however, Clairol has welcomed her back into the spotlight and in front of the camera. Last week the brand announced Norman, 63, as the face of its new \u201cColor As Real As You Are\u201d campaign. In the accompanying video, Norman reminds us: \u201cBack in the 70s it was a different world for transgender women \u2026 I had to hide my truth.\u201d The clip ends: \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back and it\u2019s really good to be me.\u201d</p> <p>Clairol\u2019s global associate brand director Heather Carruthers said: \u201cWe\u2019re honoured to bring back Tracey Norman as a woman who no longer has to hide her truth.\u201d</p> <p>In the words of Janet Mock, a transgender advocate and the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285683/\" title=\"\">the bestselling memoir <em>Redefining Realness</em></a>, Norman\u2019s reunion with Clairol is \u201cone of those full-circle narratives of affirmation and acceptance that further chips away at the persistent myth most trans people have done so much work to unlearn: that we are not enough \u2013 not good enough or \u2018real\u2019 enough.\u201d Mock also points out that Norman is not just African American and trans, but a woman in her 60s \u2013 an age, she says, \u201cwhen our society tells women to go away and hide\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdqbYjivr1o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DdqbYjivr1o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Tracey Norman reurns to Clairol</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Mock adds: \u201cAs a black trans woman who has to grapple with a culture that tells me I am not beautiful because I am trans and I am not beautiful because I am black, seeing this living legend shine is a beacon of affirmation that, yes, we are beautiful, but more importantly we are whole, deserving and worthy.\u201d</p> <p>For Norman, who knew from a very young age that her body did not match her gender, such affirmation was hard to come by. Born in Newark, New Jersey, she was the first person in her family to graduate from high school. On the same day in 1969 that she received her diploma, she summoned the courage to tell her mother the truth. Her mother, in turn, told her she had always known.</p> <p>Within two years, Norman had begun taking hormones, thanks to a doctor working under the table for the transgender community, and was not just \u201cpassing\u201d as female, but turning heads for her beauty. She became interested, albeit tentatively, in the idea of modelling.</p> <p>One day in 1975 she spotted a group of well-known black models on the street and followed them into the Pierre hotel in New York, assuming they were heading to a fashion show. In fact they were heading to a casting. Norman, who hung back so as to be last in line, found herself facing a panel of three people. She had no idea that they were an <em>Italian Vogu</em>e editor, the fashion designer Luciano Soprani and the photographer Irving Penn. To her astonishment, she received a phone call the next day telling her she was booked for a two-day photoshoot that paid $3,000 \u2013 more money than Norman had seen in her life. By little more than chance and chutzpah, a black girl from New Jersey in 1970s America had just gone from virtually nothing to the pages of <em>Vogue</em>. Only Norman knew that the whole truth was even more extraordinary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/14/laverne-cox-orange-new-black-transgender\">Laverne Cox: 'Now I have the money to feminise my face I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m happy'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Enthusiastically endorsed by Penn, who bragged that he had discovered the next Beverly Johnson, Norman signed to Zoli agency, which began, as she has put it, \u201cbooking me left and&#xa0;right\u201d.</p> <p>One of her most loyal clients was <em>Essence</em>, a magazine Norman had worked with plenty of times before it booked her for a shoot for its Christmas issue. All was going well until a hair assistant, a man who had always asked Norman probing questions about her past, entered the shoot and spoke to the magazine\u2019s editor, Susan Taylor. Norman recalled that, soon after, the shoot was shut down and, with it, her career. She believes the hair assistant had discovered her secret. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/12/tracey-africa-transgender-model-c-v-r.html\" title=\"\">Taylor has since told <em>New York Magazine</em></a> that she has no recollection of this: \u201cNo one could have outed her to me. I always suspected she was genetically male. I accepted her as she presented herself, as an exquisitely beautiful black&#xa0;woman.\u201d</p> <p>None the less, Norman maintains this is the day her career ended. As she told <em>New York Magazine</em>: \u201cBeauty and fashion is all about illusion. So when the doors were opened for me, I walked right through. And then the doors slammed \u2026 Once the doors closed, I was no longer a woman and I no longer got the respect of a woman.\u201d</p> <p>About 18 months after that shoot, Norman bought a ticket to Paris where she got by for two years working in mostly low-profile jobs. Then, she returned to New York and signed with a small agency. When she was hired for an Ultra Sheen cosmetics ad, her third beauty contract, it seemed like a comeback. And yet word had spread so fast in New York that when the ad ran, everyone knew her foremost as \u201cthe girl who\u2019d been a&#xa0;boy\u201d.</p> <p>After that she was unable to get work and she gave up her apartment and moved back in with her mother. In the intervening years, Norman has earned a living at Show Center, a burlesque peep show featuring trans women in Times Square. She has also become an \u201cicon\u201d and \u201clegend\u201d (these terms have specific status) in the ballroom community, in which different houses, which operate like surrogate families for LGBTQ youth of colour, compete against each other in drag balls. She rose to the rank of \u201cmother\u201d in the House of Africa, hence her full name, Tracey Africa Norman, and in 2001, she was inducted into the ballroom house of fame.</p> <p>The success of her <em>Vogue</em> days, however, seemed distant and irretrievable. Then, last December, <em>New York Magazine</em> ran a cover story and, once again, her life changed. Norman, who has spent decades training herself in invisibility as a mode of survival, needed convincing to agree to such high-profile press. Yet, \u201cI was reminded,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I made history and I deserve to have it&#xa0;printed.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of the profile, Norman\u2019s career has been reborn. That is most evident in the Clairol contract \u2013 a personal triumph and homecoming for a woman shunned by her profession for decades. More important, though, it is a triumph for trans visibility.</p> <p>As she told the Huffington Post: \u201cI\u2019m hoping people will take away from this that I am human and I was presented with this great opportunity to better my life. Unfortunately, because of people\u2019s prejudices I was not able to do it.\u201d Unlike so many, however, she was afforded a second chance.</p>",

  "<p>Per tradition, the men\u2019s marathon will help close out this year\u2019s Olympic Games.

But, ahead of Sunday\u2019s race, we\u2019ve excerpted some key passages from the interview below. </p> <p>The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p> <p><strong>The Guardian: Let\u2019s start with this year\u2019s games. What are you and Meb [Keflezighi] looking forward to about Rio? What is Meb hoping to accomplish?</strong></p> <p>Bob Larsen: No American has ever made the Olympic marathon team at age 40, which Meb did in the trials. He\u2019s now 41. We have to be realistic that he can\u2019t do some of the things in a marathon that he could when he was younger. But his endurance is still quite high and he\u2019ll be ready to handle the heat, which he does quite well.<br></p> <p>At his age, he\u2019s had the experience, so the race won\u2019t overwhelm him. And he has a good backup crew \u2013 myself and others \u2013 that are there for him. We\u2019ll have him ready to do his best. In the race itself, he has to make good decisions, as he normally does, based on the weather, based on the surging that other guys do.<br></p> <p>Obviously you\u2019d love to see Meb in position to have another shot at a medal. Whether he can do that again? I would hope so. I know he\u2019s got the willpower, I know he\u2019s as tough as anybody, and we\u2019ll find out on the 21st of August.</p> <p><strong>What are some of the main challenges facing marathon runners in Rio? You mentioned weather \u2026</strong></p> <p>The challenge will be the really warm weather and fairly high humidity. It is their winter, but if it follows the normal pattern for weather for Rio that day, traditionally, on August 21 it\u2019ll be in the high 70s Fahrenheit, humidity in the 75-85% range.</p> <p>That\u2019s warm for a marathon. You have to be a little bit more cautious as to how difficult the pace is going to be, knowing that it\u2019s going to be a warm day. Ideally, you\u2019d want it a little bit under 50F. When it\u2019s cooler, you use less energy, but that won\u2019t be the case, certainly, in Rio.</p> <p>Otherwise, this marathon in Rio is relatively flat. There\u2019s a little bit of an incline in one area but essentially it\u2019s a pretty level, straightforward run. You do a 10,000m loop three times and then you run back to the start/finish line. [Editor\u2019s note: Check it out on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/rio-running-app-marathon-course-riorun\">RioRun</a>.]</p> <p><strong>And Meb\u2019s prepared for the heat?</strong></p> <p>We\u2019ve been through this many times, including in Athens in 2004, which was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040102432.html\">extreme heat</a>, and Meb handled it as well or better than anyone else. So that\u2019ll give him some advantages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f91f0569150629ad5fa21caeec08fd52ca6941b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f91f0569150629ad5fa21caeec08fd52ca6941b2/0_0_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"RioRun on a phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian\u2019s RioRun interactive podcast let\u2019s you learn about Rio de Janeiro as you trace the Olympic marathon route from wherever you are. Go to <strong>riorun.theguardian.com</strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Diehm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s the strategy for running a good race at this level of competition?</strong></p> <p>With elite runners I\u2019ve always recommended that at the beginning of the race they almost feel like they\u2019re just going on an easy, long road run with their buddies on the weekend. Not to psych up but psych down, for hopefully the first 20 miles, so that they\u2019re not using extra energy on what\u2019s going on but just relax.</p> <p>Now obviously, if a competitor goes out really hard at the beginning or they surge \u2013 and more and more we see this in elite races \u2013 then you\u2019ve got to respond and figure out whether you\u2019re gonna go with him or stay back. Those decisions are crucial too.</p> <p>The most important part of the race will be that last 10,000m (6.2miles). So you don\u2019t want to use up too much energy on your way to 20 miles. Once you get to 20, then you have to make even quicker decisions as to what you\u2019re going to do with surging or to cover surges or whether you want to push the pace yourself, especially if you don\u2019t think you have the speed to get in front of people or to beat them at the end of the race. So there\u2019s a lot that goes into this. Tactics are very important.</p> <p>If you make a major mistake and go too hard too early and overheat the body then you\u2019re pretty much cooked. You\u2019re maybe not going to be able to do much or be there at the end of the race.</p> <p>What you\u2019re trying to do is put yourself in position with 10,000m to go, if you feel you have a chance at the medal, to give yourself the best opportunity to get one of those three medals.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the difference between how a casual runner would approach a marathon versus an elite runner, like Meb?</strong></p> <p>A recreational runner is not so concerned with placement so he can be more aware of exactly what would work well for him to run his fastest race.</p> <p>One of the best ways of doing that is to start out the first five miles a little slower than what you think you can average all the way through the race. Because for your first five miles you tend to get a little excited, and go too fast, and also you\u2019re not as efficient as you are after you get a little bit more warmed up. So those first five miles, it\u2019s very critical that you hold back.</p> <p>Then in the middle, you\u2019re trying to run a little bit faster than what your average pace overall will be for the duration of the race.</p> <p>And then last five miles, or the last 10,000m, you\u2019re hopeful that you can run duplicating the first part of the race. And that\u2019s an efficient way to run it when you\u2019re not racing against other people. </p> <p>With elite athletes you don\u2019t have those choices. Because if you\u2019re going to stay with people, the race could suddenly change at any point and you\u2019ve got to be ready. So there isn\u2019t one set pattern that an athlete is going to have going into the race. He has to make decisions as he runs.<br></p> <p>Ideally you go out a little bit slow, like the recreational runner would do, run fast in the middle, and hope for the best the last few miles. Or certainly, in the Olympic games, you\u2019d love to get a medal, and the top athletes are all trying to do that.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the runner\u2019s mental state during such a demanding race? I imagine elite athletes can\u2019t afford to daydream.</strong></p> <p>An elite runner is constantly monitoring what he\u2019s doing: what the splits are; is he doing the right pace; what other people are doing around him; and concentrating on perfecting the stride and upper body mechanics so he\u2019s as efficient as he possibly can be.</p> <p>The recreational runner can afford to think about a lot of different things \u2013 and that might be an advantage because you\u2019re out there for so long in a marathon that you really don\u2019t have to think about the mechanics. Just stay relaxed, make sure you\u2019re staying within the pace you should be on. Other than that, just enjoy running out there with your friends, and even chatting and stuff like that. I think that\u2019s fine.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the difference between that casual level of runner and that elite runner: the elite runner is almost like monitoring a race car, where you\u2019re constantly paying attention to what\u2019s going on and you\u2019re very alert and trying to stay on top of things.</p> <p><strong>What sets Meb apart?</strong></p> <p>One of Meb\u2019s assets is that he still thinks clearly at the end of a race. Your oxygen is going to your legs and your heart to keep the body moving forward, so people get to a point where they don\u2019t want to think or they\u2019re not making real good decisions many times.</p> <p>Meb, even late in the race when he\u2019s being pressured, he still makes good decisions. That really separates him from a lot of runners. He can push himself to keep going hard even when there\u2019s a lot of pain and discomfort at that point in the race. And he is monitoring other people and looking for signs that their technique is faltering or they are breathing harder. He\u2019s just looking for weaknesses in other people in that last 10,000m.</p> <p>When he won the Boston Marathon the year after the bombing, he was out by himself in front \u2026 and the two Kenyans are coming at him very fast and they get within five seconds late in the race, in the last couple of miles, and Meb is going in his mind through everything that he has to do right. That his stride mechanics has to be exact, that\u2019s he\u2019s got to be very careful how he\u2019s placing his foot, his knee coming up and coming off of his heel really quickly \u2013 those types of things that he works on all the time. He does drills almost every day, so that really paid off for him. </p> <p>He\u2019s still got to stay relaxed, and he\u2019s reminding himself of all those things. And then the two Kenyans who are closing on him, who had to run really fast for the previous 10,000m to catch him, now they\u2019re getting a little bit sloppy, their bodies are twisting, they\u2019re not using their arms as efficiently, their knees are no longer coming up as well.</p> <p>And in some ways that was the difference, with Meb executing his technique throughout the race and especially in those last few miles. In a very close race, he was able to hold them off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\" data-alt=\"RioRun promo\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/08/marathon-promo-full/\">RioRun promo</a> </figure>"
