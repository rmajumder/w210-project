  "<p>A pigeon-racing champion has received a lifetime ban from the sport after allegations that he cheated to win one of the most prestigious competitions in the sport\u2019s calendar.</p> <p>Eamon Kelly, 52, from Didcot, was accused of cheating by registering 14 birds for the Tarbes Grand National race but keeping them at home and sending decoys instead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/29/spy-pigeon-becomes-jailbird-after-flight-over-pakistan-india-border\">'Suspected spy' pigeon becomes jailbird after flight over Pakistan-India border</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nationalflyingclub.co.uk/\">National Flying Club</a>, where he was an official race controller, said in a statement that the ban \u201cfollows the falsification of [Kelly\u2019s] race entry for Tarbes Grand National race dated 19 July 2016\u201d.</p> <p>It added that Kelly \u201cadmitted [cheating] in telephone conversations with the president, chairman and secretary of the National Flying Club after the falsification was confirmed by members\u201d who spotted discrepancies in the registered times.</p> <p>Pigeon racing is a sport in which specially bred and trained pigeons are released from specific locations to race back to their home lofts. Each bird wears a ring which can be removed and registered on a clock or computer, and the bird with the highest average speed wins the competition.</p> <p>The Tarbes Grand National is one of the most prestigious events in the sport, and features up to 4,000 birds who can travel between 500 and 800 miles. Pigeons are taken to the French town and are released to fly back to the UK.</p> <p>Kelly won the competition in 2015 and was due to receive \u00a31,500 in prize money and a \u00a310,000 Ford Fiesta for defending the title. But it was revealed that while his decoy pigeons flew home, Kelly would lodge arrivals using microchip tags on the birds he was keeping in his loft.</p> <p>Kelly, who started pigeon racing at the age of nine, apologised to the National Flying Club and resigned from his post, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1519785/pigeon-racing-world-rocked-after-champion-eamon-kelly-cheats-to-win-grand-national/\">the Sun reported</a>. In a statement, he said: \u201cI, Eamon Kelly, sincerely apologise to all my friends and fanciers over my stupid actions relating to the recent Tarbes race. I was tempted and fell, a decision I will regret for the rest of my life. A sport that I love so much, that has given me untold pleasure and above all friendship, I have thrown all away.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Curtis, chairman of the National Flying Club, wrote on the website prior to the ban: \u201cThe committee is very saddened by the events that took place over the Tarbes weekend and that such an occurrence put a huge cloud over the whole race. Compounded by national coverage of the event, this is a very sad day for the sport of pigeon racing that is enjoyed by so many. We wish to inform members that the National Flying Club is satisfied that no other members of the organisation are involved in this occurrence.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There is only one moment when Eddie Howe seems a little unsure about the right thing to say and that is when the question is put to him of what he would have done had the team of Football Association headhunters looking for England\u2019s next manager dialled his number.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult question to answer,\u201d Howe says. \u201cI am very patriotic.

Bournemouth managed it despite losing three key players to long-term knee injuries and on Sundaythey will be trying to halt Manchester United\u2019s early momentum under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Don\u2019t bet against it either. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/12/bournemouth-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Bournemouth won 2-1</a> in the corresponding fixture last season. The previous week, Howe\u2019s first managerial meeting with Mourinho culminated in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/05/chelsea-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">1-0 victory at Chelsea</a>. \u201cIn our history,\u201d he says, eyes sparkling, \u201cthat has to be one of our best couple of weeks ever.\u201d</p> <p>The challenge this season will be to continue the upward momentum and avoid what is commonly known in football as second-season syndrome. Howe has spent part of the summer with behind-the-scenes access at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, keen to learn more about one of the managers he respects the most. Diego Simeone\u2019s players, he reports, \u201ctrain just as hard as they play and that will surprise nobody\u201d and it is a similar work ethic he demands from his own&#xa0;squad.</p> <p>Howe, a workaholic, is often in his office by 6.30am, hair still damp from the morning shower, and generally leaves after darkness. He allowed himself a two-week holiday in Florida with his family \u2013 wife Vicky and children Harry and Rocky \u2013 but never properly switched off. \u201cEven when you are away, your phone is glued to your ear. Your wife isn\u2019t happy but if you want to be successful and do your job properly you have to do that. There were a lot of calls to our recruitment team to make sure we were signing the right players.\u201d</p> <p>Lys Mousset, a striker from Le Havre, arrived first, followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/08/bournemouth-sign-lewis-cook-leeds-united-football-transfer\" title=\"\">Lewis Cook</a> from Leeds and the Liverpool pair of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/14/bournemouth-sign-liverpool-winger-jordon-ibe-club-record\" title=\"\">Jordon Ibe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/27/bournemouth-sign-liverpool-defender-brad-smith-jordon-ibe-jurgen-klopp\" title=\"\">Brad Smith</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/01/newcastle-dwight-gayle-signs-ritchie\" title=\"\">Matt Ritchie</a>\u2019s transfer to Newcastle \u2013 a disappointment, Howe says \u2013 was widely reported at \u00a312m whereas Ibe, his replacement, was said to cost \u00a315m. In reality, Howe says, \u201cit\u2019s a lot closer than that\u201d but, whatever the fine details, the Ibe deal is a record for the Cherries. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting for me when in my first spell at the club we literally had nothing to spend,\u201d Howe says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to sign anyone for a year so to be in a position now when we can invest in the squad and buy players with huge potential, that excites me. The squad excites me.\u201d</p> <p>It is certainly a far cry from those grim days in early 2009, with Bournemouth marooned in League Two\u2019s relegation places, when the 31-year-old Howe, his playing career wrecked by injury, inherited a side that had started the season with a 17-point deduction. Howe replaced Jimmy Quinn on a caretaker basis initially, with the team seven points off safety. His first two games were away, at Darlington and Rotherham. \u201cTwo defeats,\u201d he recalls with a grimace. \u201cIt was a horrible feeling, a completely new experience for me. We couldn\u2019t have started any worse and I can remember coming off the pitch at Rotherham with our away fans venting their frustrations at us. We could hear their anger and you could understand it, too, because the club had been through some difficult, bleak times and the future looked really bleak.</p> <p>\u201cI walked off thinking: \u2018How did I end up in this position?\u2019 My passion was working with young players. I had been working at the centre of excellence and I enjoyed that role. I didn\u2019t even want to be a manager, I was just given an opportunity to do it and felt I shouldn\u2019t say no. It was straight after that game I got a phone call saying they wanted to give me the job properly. Inside my head I was thinking: \u2018No \u2026 please \u2026\u2019 I had a big decision to make because I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to be the guy who maybe took the team down.\u201d</p> <p>To hear Howe talks about these days now is to be reminded why he is so revered within his profession. Bournemouth were so skint \u2013 bucket-collection skint \u2013 they could not even afford the rent on the school pitches that passed as their training ground. \u201cWe were getting paid our wages,\u201d Howe says, \u201cbut sometimes it was one, two, three, four weeks late, and there wasn\u2019t a week without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/06/rotherham.bournemouth\" title=\"\">some sort of financial&#xa0;crisis</a>.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e9641f733b3153c5a47db4c4fe842d38c60b95c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e9641f733b3153c5a47db4c4fe842d38c60b95c/187_56_3784_2271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Howe, Bournemouth manager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a dictator but I don\u2019t seek too much opinion from players,\u2019 says the Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The club were under a transfer embargo and Howe saw, close up, just how desperate it became. \u201cGuys would be coming in and I didn\u2019t even know who they were. It turned out they were bailiffs and they wanted to take away some kit. \u2018Who are they?\u2019 I\u2019d ask, and the answer was they had \u2018come to raid the club shop again\u2019. I can\u2019t imagine what they took was worth very much but they were after goods from the shop, and it reached the point where this wasn\u2019t even something out of the ordinary. I wouldn\u2019t say it was an everyday occurrence, but it was weekly \u2013 bailiffs coming in to take stuff away.\u201d</p> <p>Against that backdrop, it is nothing short of a football miracle that Howe steered the team to survival and then set about winning three promotions in six seasons (broken up only by his 21-month hiatus at Burnley) to reach the Premier League, then kept them there, staying true to a slick, passing game. The new Bournemouth, he says, \u201cfeels like a totally different club\u201d, but operating with old values. \u201cIt served me well early in my managerial career to be under those constraints, even if it didn\u2019t feel that way at the time. It taught me to coach and to develop players. It rubberstamped the importance of team spirit. One thing we have always had is a never-say-die attitude that has served us very well during times of crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Now 38, it might be that Howe\u2019s age counted against him in the England stakes. Being younger than some of his players, he says, has never worried him but it\u2019s \u201cdefinitely been a problem for some of the players I\u2019ve managed\u201d \u2013 at least, before he shows them his work on the practice ground.</p> <p>He has a polite, easy manner, sitting behind a desk adorned with family photographs, but don\u2019t be fooled by the boyish looks: Howe is very much The Boss. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a dictator but I don\u2019t seek too much opinion from players. That\u2019s not to say I won\u2019t bounce things off them. But they are looking for you to lead. They are looking for your ideas and for you to say everything is going to be OK. What they don\u2019t want is me going to them saying: \u2018What do you think, lads?\u2019 I don\u2019t think it works like that. I\u2019m very strong in terms of what I want.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Players need to play freely.

The pressure that builds internally can make you not perform at your best level.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult one to fix because it comes down to the emotional feeling of the players. You have to alleviate that pressure and I\u2019m sure Sam will have his methods. Players need to play freely.

  "<p>It is not unusual for police chiefs to be under the spotlight or to be the subject of public criticism, whether wholly justified or not. </p> <p>It is simply a fact of life in a tough job, and police chiefs need to develop a thick enough skin to recognise what criticism is justified and what is not. But even allowing for that, the latest lurid stories on so-called police chief perks, need some rebalancing.</p> <p>In summary, according to the Daily Mail, police chiefs are voting themselves huge perks, including healthcare benefits, living in castles and taking too much leave, on top of their, by implication, overinflated salaries. Furthermore, again according to the Mail, this is all done secretly and has only been exposed thanks to crusading journalism. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/police-forces-urged-to-publish-chief-officers-pay-and-perks\">Police forces urged to publish chief officers' pay and perks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Individual police chiefs must justify their own claims for allowances, expenses and the leave they take. But I believe they are entitled to reasonable leave periods, to facilities that enable them to do their job in an efficient way, and to be compensated for expenses they incur in doing so.</p> <p>For my own part, in my career in the police service, I rarely claimed expenses, worked long hours, did not require a private health package, since I strongly believe in the NHS ethos. I did not take all my leave entitlement, and when I moved house under the requirements of the job, I normally found myself out of pocket at the end of the process, despite the compensation paid for relocation.</p> <p>I am not sure what the opposite of a perk is, but I accepted the situation as a consequence of being privileged to be a police officer and, later in my career, a chief constable.</p> <p>So how do these latest charges stand up? </p> <p>First, secrecy. With a minimum amount of web searching I found the salaries and most allowances paid to chiefs in a variety of forces. I did not search exhaustively.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/08/top-police-officers-allowances-perks-boost-basic-pay-21-per-cent\">Top police officers' allowances and perks boost basic pay by 21%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, the charge that chiefs vote themselves inflated allowances. They do not. These allowances are either agreed nationally, and therefore ultimately by the home secretary, or locally, by the police and crime commissioner (PCC). As for the future, Sir Tom Winsor defended the principle of local allowances in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/15/police-annual-fitness-tests-compulsory-redundancies\">his review of police pay and conditions</a>. He did call for these to be published in police authorities\u2019 annual reports. PCCs, the electable successor body to police authorities, could easily do choose to do this but it\u2019s their call.</p> <p>Third, the idea that these allowances are unjustifiable perks. They are not. They are compensation for expenses incurred in doing the job. As for removal expenses, most professions allow for these as compensation for the costs of the exercise and the disruption to family life that follows.</p> <p>Fourth, chiefs take too much leave. It is important to remember chiefs always have to be available. When I served it was not unusual for my annual, much less weekly leave to be interrupted, and sometimes it was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/24/weather.world4\">very big interruption</a> indeed. Most people in the UK get two days off a week, plus about 25 annual leave days. With bank holidays, that amounts to about 135 days a year. </p> <p>As for pay, chief officer pay is, so far as it is possible to calculate these matters, behind the curve for public sector chief executives, especially those in health, higher education and local government.<br></p> <p>The new home secretary, Amber Rudd, has called for transparency. Perhaps she could get one of her aides to ring the 43 forces in England and Wales, find the relevant information and publish it on the Home Office website. That exercise would probably take about two working days.<br></p> <p><em>Timothy Brain was the chief constable of Gloucestershire from 2001 to January 2010. </em></p>",
