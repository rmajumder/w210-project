  "<p>Should potato salad be called a salad? Do places make smaller sandwiches for women? Is vanilla ice-cream too vanilla? WNYC\u2019s <strong>The Sporkful</strong> (iTunes) asks the most thought-provoking questions without pretence. \u201cIt\u2019s not for foodies, it\u2019s for eaters,\u201d says host <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheSporkful?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Dan Pashman</a>, who brings a big bowl of enthusiasm and humour to the table.</p> <p>The Sporkful is about so much more than food, as the new four-part series, <a href=\"http://www.sporkful.com/who-is-this-restaurant-for-pt-1-us-versus-them/\" title=\"\">Who Is This Restaurant For?</a> demonstrates. Race, culture and dining out are explored, and Pashman politely recommends you listen to all four episodes in order. Take his advice and you\u2019ll come out with more questions than answers, in a good way. When you go into a sushi restaurant, do you expect to see Japanese staff? Is it wrong to assume that white people won\u2019t get the best food in an Indian restaurant?</p> <p>Facing your prejudices around dining out is tough and the final instalment is where The Sporkful hits hard, with the extremely likable comedian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wkamaubell?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">W Kamau Bell</a> talking about why he doesn\u2019t wear hoodies in restaurants. As one half of an interracial marriage, he jokes about going out to dinner with his wife. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to a nice place, and they\u2019re super busy and super uptight, I\u2019ll go: \u2018Honey, why don\u2019t you go and use some of your white people skills to get us a table?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe more mixed a place is, the better I feel about it,\u201d he admits. \u201cThe room is warmer, it\u2019s friendlier, it\u2019s smarter. The food\u2019s probably better because they have to serve a lot of different palates.\u201d</p> <p>But one horrifying incident comes out when he tells the tale of a visit to a \u201cfancy coffee shop\u201d in Berkeley. He stopped to talk to his wife, who was sitting outside with their baby and her friends. The staff told him to go away because they thought he was trying to sell something. In fact, he was showing his wife a book he\u2019d just bought. \u201cIt just reminded me that wherever you go, you\u2019re still black,\u201d he says. \u201cMark Zuckerberg can walk in dressed in a hoodie and jeans, whereas if I walk in dressed that way, it means something completely different.\u201d Hearing that he feels like he needs to come across as ultra-friendly (and smaller) to feel comfortable in a restaurant is hard to swallow. As ever, in talking about food The Sporkful opens up a warm and friendly discussion of so much more.</p> <p><strong>If you like this, try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\" title=\"\">Spilled Milk</a></p>",
  "<p>In many ways I was the stereotype of a troublesome teenager. I used to spend most of my weekends drinking heavily \u2013 sometimes in bars or nightclubs, if I managed to blag my way past the bouncers and could afford it, but more often as part of a group of 20 or 30 kids hanging around in a local park. Illegal drugs like cannabis were fairly common.</p> <p>As is fairly typical of unsupervised, intoxicated teenagers, people would often end up doing stupid things in an attempt to impress their mates. I remember someone breaking into a crown green bowling clubhouse and nicking all the trophies. Another time, a couple of boys ran down the street picking up and smashing plant pots as they went. Inspired, I think, by an episode of The Simpsons, stealing car hood ornaments was briefly a popular activity. I might not have been an instigator, but I wasn\u2019t always an innocent bystander either.</p> <p>Our misbehaviour might have been fairly trivial, but it was still antisocial and reckless. I could have been arrested on dozens of occasions, but my contact with the police was fairly minimal. They sometimes showed up at house parties after neighbours complained about noise and told us to quieten down or go home. Very rarely do I remember anyone being searched for drugs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more privileged your background, the more likely that criminal behaviour at this age will be seen as a 'mistake'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the time, I might have put this down to luck. Looking back it seems likely there were other factors at play. It mattered that most of this took place in some of the more affluent postcodes of Sheffield, and that the majority of the kids involved were from so-called \u201cgood families\u201d \u2013 well-spoken and not previously known to the police. Almost certainly, it mattered that most of us were white.</p> <p>Not all communities are policed in the same way. The place you live, the way you look and even your accent affect whether you\u2019re likely to be identified as potentially criminal. Stop-and-search powers are used much more frequently with certain social groups. As <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/britains-upper-classes-are-less-likely-to-be-busted-for-drugs\" title=\"\">Inspector Nick Glynn</a>, vice president of the National Black Police Association, notes: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t well off \u2013 if you\u2019re young, from an urban area, black, or Asian \u2013 your chances of getting stopped by the police for drugs are much higher.\u201d Police rarely bothered anyone where I grew up unless they were called to investigate a specific complaint.</p> <p>Even when caught committing a criminal offence, people are treated differently depending on their background. Researchers at the LSE found that, in London, people from the highest socioeconomic class \u2013 doctors, lawyers, journalists \u2013 were three times more likely to be let off with a caution for drug offences than people who were unemployed. Evidence suggests that experimenting with illegal drugs is <a href=\"http://www.poverty.org.uk/38/index.shtml\" title=\"\">roughly equal across the socioeconomic spectrum</a>, and regular drug use more common among young people, but the vast majority of those in prison for drug offences are not from middle-class backgrounds.</p> <p>A new <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37770576\" title=\"\">report by the commons justice committee</a> has called for offenders aged 18-25 to be treated with more leniency, as \u201ctemperance \u2013 the ability to evaluate the consequences of actions and to limit impulsiveness and risk-taking\u201d is still developing at that age. What it doesn\u2019t acknowledge is that some young people are already afforded that benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>The more privileged your class background, the more likely it is that criminal behaviour at this age will be construed as a \u201cmistake\u201d \u2013 the product of youthful high spirits and something you\u2019ll inevitably grow out of in time. Mostly, this seems to be an accurate assumption. However, the justice committee report notes that incarcerating young people increases the likelihood they\u2019ll enter into a cycle of offending. Labelling people as criminal is often a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/17/governments-448m-troubled-families-scheme-has-had-little-impact-thinktank\">More than \u00a31bn for troubled families 'has had little impact'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s abundantly clear that the rules aren\u2019t the same for everyone. At one extreme you\u2019ve got Bullingdon Club members, infamous for committing criminal damage and other offences with impunity, shielded from any consequence by their money, connections and visible poshness. At the other, predominately working-class <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/asbo\" title=\"\">young people stuck with injunctions</a> for \u201cdrunken behaviour\u201d and \u201cplaying loud music at night\u201d. These injunctions, which replaced Asbos, are given to children as young as 10, and recipients over the age of 18 risk being incarcerated for up to five years if they defy directives by doing things like \u201cgoing to [their] local town centre\u201d or \u201cspending time with people who are known as trouble-makers\u201d.</p> <p>In recommending that more effort is made to keep 18-25s out of prison, the justice committee\u2019s report effectively suggests that the leniency already afforded to comparatively privileged young people is extended across the class spectrum. So that kids from city centre council estates can behave as stupidly as say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/10/uk-riots-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> in his younger years, without it ruining their life.</p> <p>It\u2019s a welcome, common-sense intervention, but tackling class and racial bias in UK police practice is likely to require a more sustained effort to promote cultural change. I was allowed to make mistakes when I was young \u2013 now all of us that were so fortunate have a duty to speak out in an effort to end this unfairness.</p>",
  "<h2>I have no idea whether it was the lie or the truth that got me hired<br></h2> <p>I decided that I wanted to work as a software developer part-way through my science degree. As I didn\u2019t want to start my degree all over again, I completed it and decided to embellish the amount of experience I gained in software development throughout my course.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He showed me a photo of a huge desk which he said would be my new desk.

As it turned out, the interviewer was vastly more interested in my experience as a delivery driver at a restaurant he liked. After swapping a number of stories about it, there was little time to go over any relevant experience I had. I went on to get the job. To this day I have no idea whether it was the lie or the truth that got me hired.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><em tabindex=\"-1\">Mike, software developer </em></p> <h2>It\u2019s hard to keep up with the lies - I\u2019ve learned to avoid certain people</h2> <p>I got my job in the civil service as a clerk several decades ago with A-levels. When an opportunity to work across departments on various projects became available I wrote on my CV I had a BA in political science. I also lied about my age to cover up gaps where I needed to. </p> <p>I\u2019m not sorry; I work really hard and have made management and have been able to invest and save. It does get hard sometimes to keep up with the lies. But I\u2019ve learned to avoid certain people in my life over the years. You could probably call me a sociopath, but you need to be to survive. <br tabindex=\"-1\"><em tabindex=\"-1\">Anonymous, civil servant</em></p> <h2>Instead of a meeting, I attended a late night Abba drag show</h2> <p>When asked about my time management skills, I said that in a previous role I had a late night and early morning teleconference on a Thursday evening and that I scheduled work that required low amounts of thinking the following day. It was true that I did schedule brain-dead tasks for a Friday; what was not true is that I had a late night meeting. Instead, I attended a late night Abba drag show at the famous Imperial Hotel in Sydney (where they filmed The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert), which was a lot more fun.</p> <p>Karma came back to bite me, though \u2013 in a subsequent job, I ended up running a teleconference, at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning every Friday. <br tabindex=\"-1\"><em tabindex=\"-1\">CJ, clinical research</em></p> <h2>I can no longer remember which of the stories I tell are true</h2> <p>Interviewing depends a lot on stories: \u201cTell me about a time when you showed leadership ... Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult decision.\u201d</p> <p>So a few years ago, I sat down and wrote out about 20-30 stories, one for each potential question I could be asked. Not many of them were outright lies \u2013 the majority were mostly truthful, just embellished in a few places to give a better outcome or to highlight my role more. I then started telling those stories in every interview I\u2019ve had since. It\u2019s proved very successful.</p> <p>The weird thing is, I can no longer remember which of the stories are true and which ones aren\u2019t. They\u2019ve become so ingrained, and I\u2019ve told them so many times, that I\u2019ve started to think they actually did happen the way I\u2019ve constructed them.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/oct/03/what-have-you-lied-about-to-get-a-job-share-your-stories#comment-84533615\">DontMessWithMimi</a></em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/lie-degree-cv-jobseekers-graduate\">Degree deceit: does it pay to lie on your CV?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>I went home feeling guilty, and decided to hand in my notice</h2> <p>I signed up to an employment agency saying I had admin experience. In truth, I\u2019d helped a family member post some letters. It was a new role, created for the office exec, who had complained of having too much to do, but I immediately clocked that he was incompetent and had complained to cover his back. I knew it was win-win: if he kept his job, I kept mine. So I set about pretending to everyone in the office that I was really, really busy, when I was actually busy creating folders and rearranging the desktop on the PC. I told the exec I had plenty to do and he seemed to accept that. </p> <p>One day when I got bored of pretending to work, I decided to explore different departments. So I wandered around the offices, introducing myself and asking if anyone had anything they needed help with. I collected a variety of different tasks and I soon became indispensable, respected and in demand. Everyone in my office thought I was busy getting on with keeping the office running, and was completely happy. In reality I was doing random things for people in other departments to bide my time. I soon became bored, so one day I explored the staff facilities and discovered a shower block. So I incorporated a languorous shower into my daily routine. </p> <p>The end came when one day my boss called me in and said what I good job I was doing, that production and performance was up and the company had created a permanent job for me \u2013 but I had to apply for it. He also said we were all moving to another office and he showed me a photo of a huge desk which he said would be my new desk. That night I went home feeling really guilty, and decided to hand in my notice the following week. I knew that someone more qualified could fulfil that role properly in the department I was supposed to be working in. I am now a teacher, which is what I always wanted to do. But I still think being there helped to boost morale in the office as I got on with everyone and helped to nurture a busy vibrant atmosphere ... when I wasn\u2019t pampering in the shower.<br><em>Anonymous, former healthcare retail </em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a job?
