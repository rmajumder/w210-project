  "<p>Dame Sarah Storey\u2019s incessant hunger means that she has barely had a chance to let her hair down since becoming the most decorated female British Paralympian of all time. Last week Storey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/08/sarah-storey-megan-giglia-paralympics-gold\" title=\"\">surpassed Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson\u2019s record</a> of 11 Paralympic golds with victory in the C5 individual pursuit and all the evidence suggests the thought of taking it easy has not crossed her mind for one second.</p> <p>Coupled with her natural ability on a bike, that relentless will to win is why Storey remains as awesome as ever at the age of 38 and the message for any budding British athletes hoping to catch her is that she wants to keep pulling away from Grey-Thompson\u2019s tally.</p> <p>Storey topped a Paralympic podium for the 13th time after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/paralympics-gb-beat-london-2012-gold-medal-rio-games-sarah-storey\" title=\"\">winning the C5 time trial</a> on the road in Pontal on Wednesday, a victory that took ParalympicsGB clear of their tally of 34 gold medals at London 2012, and it will be a shock if she does not complete a hat-trick in Rio by making a successful defence of her road race title on Saturday.</p> <p>Do not expect Storey to announce her retirement if she wins \u2013 she has already spoken about competing at Tokyo 2020.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/08/sarah-storey-megan-giglia-paralympics-gold\">Sarah Storey makes history on golden day of Paralympics cycling for Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is 24 years since Storey made her Paralympic debut as a swimmer but her coach, Gary Brickley, believes that she is talented enough to race in the Olympics. \u201cWhen you look at the differences between her and the Olympic team, she should really be in the team pursuit Olympic team in terms of the engine that she\u2019s got,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she can prove you can win the Olympics at 42, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/10/kristin-armstrong-beats-wild-weather-olympic-cycling-time-trial-gold\" title=\"\">Kristin Armstrong did</a>. You can\u2019t give those excuses any more, that you\u2019re missing a hand, that you have a child, or you\u2019re too old because, on paper, her stats say she\u2019s one of the best horses on the track.\u201d</p> <p>Storey gave birth to her daughter Louisa three years ago. Supported by her husband Barney, Storey has been able to stay with her away from the athletes\u2019 village.</p> <p>\u201cLouisa\u2019s a bubbly kid that\u2019s not out for grabbing attention all the time,\u201d Brickley said. \u201cEvery training camp and competition Louisa is with her. She\u2019s timed it perfectly after the last Games, come back after a year and she trained all the way up to just before she gave birth. She had a long period of breastfeeding which she worked through really well, so she\u2019d get to the top of the hill and breastfeed at the end.</p> <p>\u201cSo when people say: \u2018I can\u2019t train or do exercise because I\u2019ve got a child,\u2019 that\u2019s nonsense. Some bits have been a little bit difficult, like she couldn\u2019t bring Louisa into the village so she had to be a little bit outside. But in some ways that\u2019s better because it gives her a little bit of peace.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/kadeena-cox-gb-paralympics-rio-athletics-gold\">Kadeena Cox secures golden double in different sports with T38 400m win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The road race has been billed as a confrontation of sorts between Storey and Kadeena Cox, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/14/kadeena-cox-gb-paralympics-rio-athletics-gold\" title=\"\">one of the new stars of cycling and athletics</a>.

A natural sprinter, Cox is not expected to last the pace in the road race and she might not make it to the start line after injuring her right hamstring when Britain won silver in the 4x100m relay on Thursday night. It was her fourth medal: she won bronze in the T38 100m on Friday last week.</p> <p>While their strengths lie in different areas, Cox looks up to Storey and also harbours ambitions of returning to non\u2011disabled sport one day.</p> <p>\u201cSarah is an amazing person to have on the team and to get advice from,\u201d Cox said. \u201cShe\u2019s been behind me and supported me and talked me through the 500 even though we were competing against each other.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s achieved some amazing things. I know that she did some stuff on the able-bodied team and I want to follow in her footsteps and see if I can do something in the able-bodied cycling team.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of hard work but it\u2019s something that I\u2019d really like to do. She is someone you can go to because she has a wealth of knowledge. She has been around since before I was born. She\u2019s got so much to give and is so helpful. She\u2019s a nice person to be around.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully I will be in the road race \u2013 I am not sure if I will make it there. It has been a really good championships. I got spiked and have a hamstring injury which needs to be checked. I am not necessarily going to be in there. I have had a great championships and if I can be on the start line, I will be there.\u201d</p> <p>But even if Cox does make it, Storey is unlikely to view her as a threat.</p>",

That an American psycho stands but one remove from the White House is as deadly serious as it gets, and those opposed to Trump\u2019s hideous and historically ominous ideology must do everything they can to stop him. I do not mean to sound defeatist. But I am constantly staggered at how staggeringly ineffectual those who were once the best and the brightest are in the face of post-fact posturing.</p> <p>I wish it were otherwise, but there is something very dating about the mere act of engaging with Trump\u2019s lies, like watching a respected comedian misfire with an out-of-touch bit about Snapchat. To watch a pundit even begin to pick apart that birther non-apology is to watch a human being age 10 years on screen in the time it takes to get to \u201cDonald J Trump is a closer\u201d. You might as well have a Socratic debate with a fart.</p> <p>A decade or so ago, I remember reading a statistic about how pretty much everyone under a certain cut-off age instinctively rang doorbells with their thumb \u2013 raised on games consoles and mobile phones and whatnot \u2013 while pretty much everyone over the age still used an index finger.

But with the greatest of respect to these viewpoints, I can\u2019t help feeling that a good portion of our best hope for countering Trumpvision lies in the hands of that younger (to me) generation, who reflexively seem to understand what in the name of insanity is happening now far better than their elders, and increasingly seem more likely to find a way of countering it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">Rick Astley: Never Gonna Give You Up</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Youth isn\u2019t always wasted on the young, and even the most self-regarding old hands must concede that Trump has almost all of them looking flatfooted.

Perhaps truth in politics will return ironically, like dad jeans or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/04/rick-astley-live-review\" title=\"\">Rick Astley</a>. Whether truth will ever be the market leader again, however, seems less certain with every hour of this mesmerically modern US presidential campaign (just as it did, in a smaller and even more post-imperial kinda way, during the Brexit referendum).</p> <p>Then again, perhaps anxiety about the absence of truth is far older than we neophytes care to imagine, there being precisely nothing new under the sun. \u201cIf truth be not fled with Astraea,\u201d remarked Jonathan Swift all the way back in 1711, \u201cshe is certainly as hidden as the source of the Nile itself, and can be found only in Utopia.\u201d Perhaps she can once again be found in the 24-hour political news cycle \u2013 though at present, you certainly wouldn\u2019t rule it in.</p>",

  "<p>By the end of Black Mirror\u2019s UK run, the show, while still impressive, was in danger of turning into self-parody. There was even a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ideasblack\">joke account</a> tweeting out faux stories about how our nefarious iPads and sinister Facebook accounts were secretly plotting against us.<br></p> <p>But after it proved a hit on Netflix in the US, the streaming platform (whose monopoly over our viewing habits could easily be the basis of a future episode) bought the rights and commissioned a splashy new series. With Charlie Brooker onboard but with a bigger budget and a starry new cast, it\u2019s a minor victory that the show not only retains its dark spirit but adds yet more complexity.</p> <p>In the first two episodes, showing as part of the small-screen strand of the Toronto film festival, Brooker (with help from a new team of big names) displayed his knack for exploring not only the evils of technology but the life-changing benefits it might bring. In San Junipero, we follow Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis), a gawky young woman in the 1980s, uncomfortably traversing her way through a club filled with others having more fun than her. One of these is Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a sexually confident woman who tries to bring Yorkie out of her shell. But there are limitations, both with what Yorkie is comfortable doing and the strange focus on time that threatens to bring their fun to an end at midnight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/13/transparent-review-season-three-hits-new-highs-as-the-pfeffermans-shine-brighter-than-ever\">Transparent review \u2013 season three hits new highs as the Pfeffermans shine brighter than ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To say much more about the plot would be a spoiler, but Brooker takes us to surprising and ultimately poignant places. Davis and Mbatha-Raw are both sorely underused actors and their journey provides them with a welcome opportunity to impress with their emotional range, pulling us into a story of forbidden and unusual same-sex love.</p> <p>The second episode Nosedive is more traditionally Black Mirror in its tale of the sinister side of technological progress, but it\u2019s pulled off with a freshness that prevents it from ever feeling heavy-handed. Lacie (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a woman keen to achieve self-improvement. In the world she lives in that means improving her public rating, which is done by impressing others with her social media presence and daily interactions. Everything is given a score, from her small talk in the elevator to the quality of her cutesy coffee shop pictures. When school friend Naomi (Alice Eve) asks her to be maid-of-honour at her glamorous wedding, Lacie sees a chance to make a major change to her life.</p> <p>Co-written by Rashida Jones and directed by Joe Wright, Nosedive manages to create a believable and aesthetically impressive mini-universe without the need for tiresome exposition. As with most episodes, it\u2019s an extension of our world with the excessive reliance on social media popularity and the dull preponderance of sweetly inane personalities winning out. Your rating increases with every nice thing you say and do, even if you\u2019re lying through your teeth, which makes the tension slowly escalate throughout. Howard expertly nails a woman trying to be liked but masking a set of negative, or even just honest, reactions and emotions that threaten to bubble over.</p> <p>Both episodes boast a cinematic sheen, allowing for more immersive world-creation and even more ambitious narratives. Brooker\u2019s show retains its status as a marvel, hinting at darker and greater things to come.</p>",

Olisa wrote: \u201cI am concerned that some readers would interpret that as racism from fellow officers.

The museum\u2019s volume is politely set back to align with its neighbours. <a href=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/04/15/arts/smit.600.jpg\">A planned podium</a>,on which the gilded crown would have sat, has been pushed below ground \u2013 where half the museum\u2019s accommodation is also buried. These are departures from the competition-winning scheme, but improvements, giving the museum a seductive jewel-box scale. At 400,000 sq ft, it is twice the size of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/23/whitney-museum-renzo-piano-icebreaker\">the new Whitney Museum</a> in New York but looks dinky in comparison with its neighbouring Goliaths here in DC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d5aebd387ee9d35b40373617a6c6a81cd5187e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d5aebd387ee9d35b40373617a6c6a81cd5187e4/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The neighbouring Washington Monument \u2026 views outside are somewhat diminished by heavy fixings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The neighbouring Washington Monument \u2026 views outside are somewhat diminished by heavy fixings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Picking up on the city\u2019s quasi-masonic web of ley-lines, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm\">set out in </a><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm\">Pierre l\u2019Enfant\u2019s</a><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm\"> 1791 urban plan</a>, which weave Washington\u2019s main landmarks into a sometimes suffocating web, Adjaye has slashed great slots into his facade to align with important features in the surrounding landscape. With the forbidding air of defensive arrow-slit windows, these cuts frame views to the White House and the Washington Monument, to the Thomas Jefferson and Martin Luther King memorials a kilometre away, binding DC\u2019s ceremonial landscape to the African American story \u2013 and suggesting the museum is here to keep a watchful eye out.</p> <p>The design also draws on African precedents. The pagoda-like form was inspired by the crown of a carved figure on a veranda post, made by a Yoruba sculptor in west Africa, which Adjaye spotted in an overlooked corner of a Munich museum (it\u2019s now on loan here, with pride of place in the centre of the uppermost gallery). The filigree metal cladding is a reference to the decorative ironwork found on houses in Charleston and New Orleans, made by slave craftsmen. Adjaye has created his own abstract version, with a repeat pattern of 3,600 panels that have an organic, slightly sci-fi air. Somewhere between art nouveau and HR Giger, it gives the building the look of an exotic mothership, ready for takeoff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b5d5d1477df93a586c291a7aeee50a3b364f4fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b5d5d1477df93a586c291a7aeee50a3b364f4fc/0_42_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Powerful exhibits \u2026 statue of Tommie Smith and John Carlos giving the black power salute at the 1968 Mexico Olympics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Powerful exhibits \u2026 statue of Tommie Smith and John Carlos giving the black power salute at the 1968 Mexico Olympics</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This chameleonic coat has a dark brown patina in some lights and shimmers bright gold in others, <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/BKTv0qUAyrd/\">shifting its character</a> as you pass around it. From some angles it gleams in the sweltering late-summer sun, but it\u2019s not quite as sparkly as planned. The intended cast bronze is now coated aluminium: bronze would have been too heavy, and the fixings couldn\u2019t be guaranteed for the Smithsonian\u2019s required 50 years. The plan for large surfaces of perforated metal (similar to <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/66619/m-h-de-young-museum-herzog-de-meuron\">Herzog &amp; de Meuron\u2019s De Young Museum</a> in San Francisco) also gave way to smaller repeat modules. These choices don\u2019t ruin the effect, but they lend the building a slight cheapness \u2013 a feeling that gets more pronounced when you step inside.</p> <p>Walking into the main entrance hall, past a reflecting pool and under a dramatic cantilevered concrete canopy, it\u2019s hard to shake the sense of an airport. Once you have navigated through the security obstacle course, you\u2019re left in a space of grey plasterboard walls and suspended ceiling tiles, and shuffled towards an elevator. <a href=\"http://freelon.com/lib/images/projects/1464.jpg\">Early designs</a> depicted a dramatic ceiling of undulating wooden stalactites, abandoned for reasons of practicality and fire safety. Adjaye isn\u2019t too concerned. \u201cSince I revealed that image eight years ago, it has become the most copied ceiling in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s even in Starbucks, it\u2019s been completely destroyed.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://instagram.com/p/BKTv0qUAyrd/\"                                                                        > <video src=\"http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t50.2886-16/14370956_303057900059319_1967266375_n.mp4\" width=\"460\" height=\"820\" type=\"video/mp4\" controls frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></video> <figcaption>Video: changing patterns of light on the museum\u2019s exterior</figcaption> </figure>   <p>It might also have been out of his hands. Although credited as lead designer, Adjaye is one of four architecture practices responsible for the project, a cocktail of divided responsibilities that feels like too many cooks. The Freelon Group, headed by African American architect Philip Freelon, was the lead practice, with specific responsibility for the building\u2019s interior from the ground floor up. Davis Brody Bond, co-founded by another black architect, the late Max Bond, handled the interiors below ground. </p> <p>Long-time Smithsonian collaborator, SmithGroup, was in charge of the envelope and foundations, while Adjaye is described as the \u201ccreative force\u201d behind the \u201cformal development\u201d of the building: he came up with the shape and the key organisational ideas. The whole project, then, was co-ordinated in the cloud, using BIM modelling software, and there are moments where you sense the left hand might not have quite understood the right hand\u2019s intentions, areas that appear to have slipped through the contractual cracks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/02/david-adjaye-interview-not-always-looking-at-usual-references\">David Adjaye interview: 'I'm not always looking at the usual references'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The circulation areas, housed in the gap between the outer facade and the gallery levels within, promised to be a dramatic sequence up escalators and along cantilevered landings, veiled by the lacy mesh. The result feels half-baked. From the inside, the cumbersome steel structure needed to hold up the facade takes up most of the view, while the impact of specially framed vistas to nearby monuments is lessened by clunky fixings.</p> <p>In the heart of the exhibition spaces, these niggles fade away. Davis Brody Bond, who designed the evocative subterranean lair of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/14/9-11-memorial-museum-new-york\">the 9/11 Memorial Museum</a> in New York, have brought a similarly crepuscular atmosphere to the underground history galleries, an appropriate setting for the story of the darkest hours of the Atlantic slave trade. A warren of low-ceilinged rooms give way to a gaping triple-height hall, lined with rough-textured grey plaster walls, and a winding route past such haunting exhibits as a whipping post and a segregated train carriage, slave huts and a stone auction block, along with an overwhelming number of artefacts, text panels, films and interactive video screens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/455288523531fb361d1586c6be06b5ccbbee7797/0_0_3000_1999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This wooden sculpture by Nigeria\u2019s Olowe of Ise wears a crown on which the NMAAHC\u2019s design is based.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This wooden sculpture by Nigeria\u2019s Olowe of Ise wears a crown on which the NMAAHC\u2019s design is based.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things get cheerier upstairs. Once you\u2019ve passed through the \u201ccontemplative court\u201d, a much-needed respite space <a href=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2012/02/dezeen_Smithsonian-Museum-of-African-American-History-and-Culture-by-David-Adjaye-and-FAB_5.jpg\">lit by an oculus and waterfall</a> (still under construction), you ascend to the upper levels of the community and culture galleries, where the full kaleidoscope of African American contributions to musicvisual arts, sports, food, business and the military is documented in all its multifaceted glory.</p> <p>Like the exhibitions inside it, the museum building embodies its complexities and contradictions, charged as it is with a brief and a site as impossibly fraught as the history it is telling. Despite some clunks, the result has a compelling, spiky otherness, standing on the Mall as a welcome rebuke to the world of white marble monuments to dead white men.<br></p>",
  "<p>Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda has accused the New York legal system of being prejudiced in his first interview since he took a seven-year plea deal earlier this month after being arrested on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/30/bobby-shmurda-pleads-not-guilty-guns-drugs-conspiracy-charges\">guns, drugs and conspiracy charges</a> in December 2014.</p> <p>Speaking to the <a href=\"http://www.complex.com/music/2016/09/bobby-shmurda-interview-rowdy-rebel\">hip-hop magazine and website Complex</a>, Shmurda \u2013 whose real name is Ackquille Pollard \u2013 accused the judge who oversaw his case as seeing him as a \u201cblack thug\u201d and said the case would have played out differently if he had made bail. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/06/bobby-shmurda-denied-bail-for-fourth-time\">He had six unsuccessful bail hearings</a>).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/02/bobby-shmurda-shmoney-dance\">Mo' shmoney, mo' problems: the curious case of Bobby Shmurda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we made bail I would\u2019ve beat the case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look guilty in these orange jumpsuits. If you put Al Sharpton in a orange jumpsuit and accuse him of having a gun, he\u2019s going to be found guilty. They just look at our skin color, and look at where we\u2019re from.\u201d<br></p> <p>The rapper spoke about his $2m (\u00a31.51m) bail, which was seen as very steep for someone charged with a first offence, and the sum was almost met by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/05/bobby-shmurda-stays-in-jail-2m-dollar-bail-package-falls-through\">a bail application that was eventually withdrawn</a>. </p> <p>\u201cThey held my bail at $2m for a gun charge,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how America is. They got these kids running around with rape charges getting six months and they wanna give me seven years for a gun charge.\u201d</p> <p>He said that he had some support from his label, Epic but that even with the backing of their lawyers he wasn\u2019t able to get the charges thrown out.<br></p> <p>\u201cI explained the whole situation to Epic and they were behind me all the way. We had big money lawyers and they still couldn\u2019t do nothing because of the judge, who looked at us like black thugs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Pollard\u2019s time behind bars was eventful: as well as the six bail hearings, he also went through three lawyers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/24/bobby-shmurda-wants-to-leave-epic-jail-conspiracy\">left his record label</a>, was in a prison brawl and also allegedly tried to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/24/bobby-shmurda-tried-to-get-a-knife-in-prison-court-told\">smuggle a knife into prison via his girlfriend</a>.</p> <p>He suggested that the trial taking place in the more affluent and whiter borough of Manhattan, rather than his native Brooklyn, also affected the outcome.</p> <p>\u201cMy lawyer told me we don\u2019t want to go to court in Manhattan with these white people because they\u2019re going to be looking at me, a little black kid.</p> <p>\u201cWho are they going to believe, the word of this black kid talking about shooting shit up or the word of white officers? A jury is going to believe cops all day. We\u2019re black kids, these are white people with badges.\u201d</p> <p>After taking a plea deal of seven years, Pollard could be out much sooner because of time served and potential reductions connected to good behavior. He said that he\u2019s planning to write a book about his experiences and life story.</p> <p>\u201cI have three years to make a book happen. I got love for 50 Cent, I got love for DMX, but my movie\u2019s gonna be better than Get Rich or Die Tryin\u2019 and Belly put together, and it\u2019s gonna be a true story. </p> <p>\u201cI want people to hear my story, they\u2019re gonna feel my pain.\u201d</p>"
