  "<p>The passage of North Carolina\u2019s House Bill 2, a law that bans transgender people from using the public bathrooms that match their gender identities, has inspired an unusually vocal protest from private businesses, many of which have been silent on other divisive national debates on gender and civil rights.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.trilliuminvest.com/investors-worth-2-1-trillion-call-full-repeal-north-carolinas-house-bill-2/\">latest public rebuke </a>came from nearly five dozen private and public investment groups, including Morgan Stanley and New York State\u2019s pension fund, who released a <a href=\"http://www.trilliuminvest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Investor-Statement-on-North-Carolina-House-Bill-2-with-signatures-9-26-3.pdf\">signed letter </a>Monday warning that the law \u201cis making it difficult for our portfolio companies to provide the safe, open, and inclusive environment necessary for a successful workplace\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cNot only does HB2 make hiring top talent difficult, but it also has negative financial implications that reverberate across North Carolina,\u201d the letter said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/14/lgbt-business-training-prejudice-stanford\">We need to do more to keep LGBT employees from returning to the closet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The investors joined a growing roster of businesses, including big sports organizers such as the National Basketball Association and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, to loudly register their disapproval of the law. Some moves, such as canceling games or concerts \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/19/pearl-jam-springsteen-cancel-north-carolina-concert-anti-lgbt-law\">headliners including Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam pulled planned performances from the state</a> \u2013 inflict significant financial impact on the local economy. All told, the NBA\u2019s decision to move the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans will divest an <a href=\"http://charmeck.org/city/charlotte/Newsroom/Pages/2017NBAAllStarGamesFAQs.aspx\">estimated $100m dollars in profits from the city of Charlotte</a>, no small loss for a place with <a href=\"https://www.nccommerce.com/tourism/research/economic-impact/teim\">more than 45,000 jobs directly tied to tourism</a>.</p> <p>\u201cDiscrimination of any kind cannot be allowed,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KDTrey5/status/756281543522418688\">tweeted Kevin Durant </a>of the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors.</p> <p>Some companies went even further by vowing to suspend business operations in the state for as long as the law was still in effect. PayPal, for instance, reneged on a promised $3.6bn investment there, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/15/north-carolina-lgbt-law-business-backlash\">Deutsche Bank canceled plans to hire 250 people </a>in North Carolina in 2017.</p> <p>A group of about 100 major companies urged North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to repeal the law, a number that eventually swelled to more than 180, including Apple, Airbnb, Bank of America, Starbucks and United Airlines. They partnered with the transgender advocacy groups <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/press/pressure-builds-in-north-carolina-as-more-executives-from-major-companies-c?xid=nl_raceahead\">Human Rights Campaign and Equality NC to sign a widely shared letter </a>stating that laws like HB2 \u201care bad for our employees and bad for business\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not unusual for companies to take a stance on controversial social issues. Back in 1993, the National Football League <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/24/what-does-the-nfl-have-to-do-with-arizonas-bill-letting-businesses-refuse-service-to-gay-people/?utm_term=.8c8d365250fd\">refused to hold the Super Bowl in Tempe, Arizona</a>, because the state would not honor Martin Luther King Jr with a holiday.</p> <p>But North Carolina\u2019s legislation appears to have drawn a much more fierce response from a wide range of businesses. The same can\u2019t be said for other divisive issues such as the right to vote and abortion. Since when have so many companies been such vocal supporters of transgender rights? How did the private sector become so activist?</p> <p>Deena Fidas, director of the <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/hrc-story/workplace-project-internship\">workplace equality program at the Human Rights Campaign</a>, said the transgender issue is benefiting from a long held recognition by businesses that protecting their gay, lesbian and bisexual employees from discrimination directly affects their ability to attract talent and make money.</p> <p>\u201cThey were saying it was both the right thing to do, and also it was the right thing for their businesses,\u201d said Fidas, who called 2011 \u201cthe tipping point\u201d in terms of companies getting vocal in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.</p> <p>But behind closed doors, the Fortune 500 actually has a track record of working with LGBT rights groups. During the 1990s and 2000s, before <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/\">the tide of public opinion had fully turned in favor of same-sex marriage rights</a>, LGBT employees began forming working groups at their companies to seek same-sex partner benefits, diversity training programs and LGBT anti-discrimination policies at their offices. After a while, companies realized that if they wanted to attract and retain the best employees, they\u2019d better step up.</p> <p>\u201cFor businesses, matters of LGBT inclusion are very tied to their business goals,\u201d said Fidas. \u201cWe have been working with businesses going on two decades.\u201d</p> <p>Still, taking a public stand on LGBT rights didn\u2019t happen quickly. Less than five companies spoke out publicly in opposition of California\u2019s Proposition 8, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/prop-8-california-gay-marriage-ban-struck-down\">a 2008 ballot amendment that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman</a>, which was eventually overturned.</p> <p>But by 2011, when New York state was considering same-sex marriage, the leaders of more than two dozen major companies <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/nyregion/gay-marriage-gets-backing-from-new-york-business-leaders.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, supported the state\u2019s proposed Marriage Equality Act</a>.</p> <p>North Carolina became ground zero for the transgender bathroom debate because it was the first state to pass the law in March of this year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/transgender-bathroom-bill-texas-north-carolina-obama\">Other states </a>that have considered similar legislation within the last few years included Florida, Texas and Minnesota. North Carolina\u2019s law also bars local authorities from floating any anti-discrimination protections for LGBT residents, which US Attorney General Loretta Lynch denounced as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/may/10/us-justice-department-sues-north-carolina-over-transgender-law-video\">state-sponsored discrimination</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Fidas is director of HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index (CEI), an annual survey of more than 1,200 major companies that launched back in 2002 in order to catalogue what kinds of employment benefits and workplace inclusion policies were available for LGBT workers. Not only do the majority of the companies polled by CEI now offer same-sex partner benefits to employees, but more than 500 companies now offer at least one health care plan that includes appropriate coverage for transgender employees, <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/press/hrc-releases-first-corporate-equality-index-to-rate-global-lgbt-workplace-i\">according to the 2016 CEI survey.</a> And 75% of Fortune 500 companies have anti-discrimination policies that include gender identity, up from just 3% in 2002.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/05/transgender-fear-workplace-business\">Transgender: is there still fear in the workplace?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you look at the advancement of the rights in Fortune 500 companies compared to [LGBT] rights in the states, Fortune 500 companies were way more progressive than the states or any of the governments were,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/king_brayden.aspx\">Brayden King, a management and organizations professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Business</a>.</p> <p>King, whose research focuses on the way activists influence corporate social responsibility and legislation, says that executives are increasingly taking stronger public stances on issues such as climate change and LGBT rights.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness leaders are standing up and recognizing that they have to fill the void that\u2019s being left in many places and many states by state policymakers,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of those companies and executives feel morally that it\u2019s bad for our culture to discriminate. I really believe that. But these are also executives who have to consider the economic impact of what they do.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2011.58.4.491?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">In King\u2019s 2011 study</a> of some 133 different boycotts that occurred between 1990 and 2005, he discovered that a boycotted <a href=\"http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news_articles/2011/boycotts.aspx\">company\u2019s stock price would fall an average of 0.7% for each day it made national media headlines</a>.</p> <p>In other words, the concern about being boycotted \u201cisn\u2019t that it hurts revenues or sales,\u201d King said. Rather, it\u2019s about reputation. \u201cCompanies care so much about reputation because it\u2019s really hard to put a dollar value on how people perceive you. We do know that if people perceive you badly, it can take years and years and years [to dispel that].\u201d</p> <p>Likewise, in the case of North Carolina and HB2, King says: \u201cPeople will remember North Carolina for years after this has settled down as the state that has been associated with this controversy. They could change tomorrow, but people will still associate it with this discriminatory action it decided to take.\u201d</p> <p>He added, \u201cThe boycott becomes a permanent part of that state\u2019s narrative history, and that is fundamental to the reputation that that state has.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/aug/03/chick-fil-a-kiss-in\">same-sex couples and supporters staged \u201ckiss-ins\u201d outside Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country </a>in protest of the company\u2019s vocalized opposition to gay marriage, Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy expressed some regrets.</p> <p>\u201cConsumers want to do business with brands that they can interface with, that they can relate with,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.myajc.com/news/business/cathy-seeks-to-put-gay-marriage-flap-behind-chick-/nfCHj/\">told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2014</a>. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably very wise from our standpoint to make sure that we present our brand in a compelling way that the consumer can relate to.\u201d</p>",

The show has since taken off, and Brooks has gained mainstream recognition as a result. Through this experience, Brooks said she learned an important lesson about herself as an artist: \u201cI will never play a stereotype, because I will always make sure I make choices that are rich and colorful and try to show more of a person than meets the eye.\u201d </p> <p>The exposure from the hit show<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>led to her being called in to audition for the part of Sofia in the revival of The Color Purple<em tabindex=\"-1\">. </em>She got the part, and when the show premiered in 2015, Brooks performed alongside Jennifer Hudson and Cynthia Erivo. The production won the Tony for best revival of a musical, and Brooks herself was nominated for best featured actress in a musical. </p> <p>The content of these two productions isn\u2019t coincidental for Brooks: she seeks out projects that tell diverse stories, particularly the historically ignored stories of women of color. Though Orange is the New Black<em> </em>is set in a modern women\u2019s penitentiary, while The Color Purple<em tabindex=\"-1\"> </em>is set in the sharecropping south during the first half of the 20th century, Brooks said both productions did an extraordinary job of bringing the experiences of women of color to the forefront. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0075e3a6c157158ec14cbdb96add0eba22603e43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0075e3a6c157158ec14cbdb96add0eba22603e43/0_67_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle Brooks on stage in The Color Purple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danielle Brooks on stage in The Color Purple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Murphy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m so grateful that I\u2019m now at a point in my career where I can choose the work I want to do, because there was definitely a point where I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cNow I get to say, \u2018I only want to work with people who are pushing the needle,\u2019 and that doesn\u2019t only mean with the storytelling, but also with directors, producers and creators.\u201d</p> <p>Referencing her recent work with Lena Dunham on Girls<em> \u2013 </em>she was the first black woman to appear in the series \u2013 and with Aziz Ansari on Master of None, Brooks said the people behind the projects were just as important as the material when it came to diversifying the entertainment industry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/25/broadway-diversity-hollywood-oscars-so-white-the-color-purple\">Hollywood has a diversity problem, but Broadway may be at a tipping point</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Being socially conscious is nothing new for Brooks, who told a story of writing a letter to the mayor of her home town, Greenville, South Carolina, when she was in fourth grade. She was bothered by the flying of the Confederate flag. </p> <p>\u201cI said to him, \u2018You know, there\u2019s so much pain and hurt that my people feel from this flag,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBeing so young, I even made a new Confederate flag and put a heart in the middle of it, and I was like, \u2018Can this be the new flag?\u2019 Of course that didn\u2019t happen, and he just wrote some generic letter back.\u201d</p> <p>Her commitment to using her voice to draw attention to social issues hasn\u2019t wavered since her childhood days. Now, as a woman who works both onstage and on camera, Brooks said there were clear differences when it came to effecting social change. She believes the strength of television is its ability to reach mass audiences and references her show\u2019s commitment to discussing such social topics as police brutality, transgender issues and race relations.</p> <p>\u201cThe beauty of this is that Orange is the New Black can go into the home of some white boy in Wisconsin who has never heard of the Black Lives Matter movement, but he has fallen head over heels for this character named Poussey, and now he has been exposed to this movement,\u201d she said. \u201cHe now has a better sense of what\u2019s going on in the world because of the stories we\u2019re starting to tell.\u201d </p> <p> </p> <p>Creating this type of dialogue, Brooks said, was what helped sustain her passion as an actor. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, a few weeks ago I ran into Bree Newsome, the young lady who took the Confederate flag down in South Carolina, and we began to talk and I said to her, \u2018Thank you for taking down the flag,\u2019\u201d Brooks said. \u201cShe voiced that she understands that what I do is part of that activism, as well, and that means the world to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f84db57461025f315d961d84ea170ca62f6c1b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f84db57461025f315d961d84ea170ca62f6c1b5/26_0_722_433/500.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle Brooks in Orange is the New Black.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danielle Brooks in Orange is the New Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brooks said that her emotion in the dramatic conclusion of the most recent season came straight from looking at the New York Times and seeing Michael Brown\u2019s father crying over his son\u2019s casket. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the power of art \u2013 it really does imitate life if you are conscious enough about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI am thankful Jenji Kohan and the writers of Orange is the New Black are taking that stand instead of just giving us this fou-fou-fluff television to watch.\u201d </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Brooks said she was hopeful for the future of both TV and theater; she believes they will continue to create and foster conversations about injustice and activism. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/21/golden-age-black-tv-false-dawn-david-simon\">Is this a golden age for black TV makers or another false dawn?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen it comes to TV it\u2019s a slow burn right now, but I think we\u2019re doing it and we have to just stick with it,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now I feel excited by the material I am seeing.

  "<p>They are known as the eighth-day dogs<strong> \u2013</strong> animals whose fate is about to be decided.<strong> </strong>After seven days in a local authority pound, a lucky stray dog might be taken in by a rehoming centre, from where he may be adopted by a kind new owner. The alternative, however, is far bleaker. The latest results of a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37475055\">Dogs Trust annual survey</a> found that 3,463 unclaimed strays \u2013 many of them healthy and happy \u2013 were put to sleep between April 2015 and March 2016.</p> <p>More than 80,000 strays were collected by local council dog wardens in the year up to March 2016, according to the survey. Of those dogs \u2013 who may have escaped from gardens, run off when on a walk or even been stolen and then abandoned \u2013 just over half were reunited with their owners. But 37,283 went unclaimed.</p> <p>Virtually all strays are previously owned, as ownerless dogs are extremely rare in the UK. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have street dogs,\u201d says Lee Paris, campaigns officer for Dogs Trust. \u201cA lot of [those dogs] would have been abandoned pets, but there are cases of dogs escaping and maybe the public being unaware of how to find them.\u201d</p> <p>Local authority dog wardens \u2013 who are usually provided by private companies \u2013 collect a dog after receiving reports that it is a stray. The animal is then is kept in kennels for a minimum of seven days. Kennel conditions vary: some are run by private boarding houses and sanctuaries, but there have also been reports of dogs being housed in council-run pounds with little or no bedding and minimal veterinary care.</p> <p>If it remains unclaimed after a week, says Paris, a \u201cdog becomes the property of the council and they then need to find a new owner, whether by directly rehoming or finding rescue space. We try and take as many as we can, as do other rescue centres across the UK.\u201d If it cannot be placed, though, the dog will be put down.</p> <p>\u201cThe hardest thing is when you go to the stray kennels and you know you\u2019ve only got spaces for two dogs,\u201d says Lauren Sanderson, deputy charity manager, of <a href=\"http://\">Rain Rescue</a>, which rehomes stray dogs and cats in South Yorkshire.</p> <p>\u201cHaving to see all the ones who need your help and you have to leave them behind \u2013 that\u2019s the heartbreak. Those dogs don\u2019t have anybody. Our work is primarily to save as many of those dogs as we can. We\u2019re a small charity working in a high [dog] destruction area.\u201d</p> <p>Rain Rescue can only house 16 dogs at a time, with others placed in foster homes. However, the charity has taken in 130 dogs this year \u2013 almost all from local authority pounds. \u201cWe base [our choice] on the ones that are most in need \u2013 often they\u2019re the ones who need emergency veterinary treatment, and sometimes the local authorities can\u2019t stretch to that,\u201d says Sanderson.</p> <p>There are, Sanderson says, spikes in summer, when people seem to abandon their dogs before going on holiday, and again at Christmas, when finances are stretched.</p> <p>There are penalties for abandoning a dog, but they are hard to enforce, says Paris. The good news is that fewer stray dogs were handled by local authorities in the last year than the year before. Paris puts this down to improved rates of microchipping, before the fitting of identification implants became law in April.</p> <p>Still, more than 37,000 unclaimed and unwanted dogs seems an appallingly high figure. Some of the dogs Sanderson sees have clearly been abused or neglected. On the other hand, Dogs Trust estimates that around an eighth of unclaimed dogs are cherished family animals, whose owners have simply failed to update their dog\u2019s microchip details, and who would be horrified to find that their pet faces destruction.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you look at the dog and can see it\u2019s been well cared for at some point in its life,\u201d says Sanderson. Rain Rescue recently took in Herc, a clever German shepherd-rottweiler cross. \u201cHe has clearly been well-trained. You think: \u2018What has happened in that dog\u2019s life, or its owner\u2019s life, for it to end up in stray kennels with nobody to care for it?\u2019\u201d</p>"
