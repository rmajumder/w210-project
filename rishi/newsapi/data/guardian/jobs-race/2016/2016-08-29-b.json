  "<p>The huge disparity in youth unemployment rates across the UK has been laid bare by a new report that found over a quarter of 16- to 24-year-olds in Bradford, Middlesbrough, Swansea and Wolverhampton are now unemployed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Issues/Business-environment/Financial-markets-and-economy/Youth-unemployment-in-the-UK\">The study</a> commissioned by the accountancy firm EY found youth unemployment rates range from 18.3% in north-east England to 11.2% in the east of England. Coventry had one of the lowest youth unemployment rates out of the 48 UK cities reviewed, at just 8.2%. </p> <p>The study found youth unemployment rates vary far more around the country than overall rates of employment. </p> <p>Young people find it significantly harder to find work than their older peers in the east Midlands, where Leicester\u2019s 23.6% youth unemployment rate was more than double the average for all workers. </p> <p>Youth employment levels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/22/youth-unemployment-jobless-figure\">declined</a> by 166,000 from 2004 to 2015, the report found, with the biggest fall \u2013 28% \u2013 seen in the manufacturing sector over the same period. In the last decade, the construction, financial and business sectors have also reduced their employment of young people \u2013 those aged under 24.<br></p> <p>The two sectors that currently employ the highest proportions of young people \u2013 hotels and restaurants \u2013 are still set to grow, researchers concluded. It forecasts that between 2015 and 2030 the UK\u2019s employment in these areas will grow by an average of 0.4% a year, meaning more roles.</p> <p>Mark Gregory, EY\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cYouth unemployment rates have fallen from the peaks we saw during the recession, when 40% of the UK\u2019s 16- to 17-year-olds were facing unemployment. However, a stubbornly high number of young people remain excluded from the labour market, which could be further exacerbated by a period of weaker economic growth in these uncertain times ahead. History has shown us that young people are more exposed to economic volatility and industry restructuring than the population as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>He said the skills agenda is fast becoming one of the biggest priorities for UK business, with Brexit also likely to impose some restrictions to the free movement of labour in the future. </p> <p>\u201cIt has never been more important to ensure the UK has the right mix of skills and talent, both nationally and locally, and young people are core to this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>While youth unemployment in the UK compares relatively well with that in most other countries in Europe, the UK rate is almost double that in Germany. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/youth-unemployment+world/europe-news\">Youth unemployment rates seen in France, Italy and Spain reach almost 50%. </a></p> <p>Maryanne Matthews, chief executive of EY Foundation, an independent UK charity set up to help young people who face barriers in the labour market, said: \u201cIt is imperative that UK employers open their doors to invest in developing the skills of young people. By offering paid work experience opportunities to young people, this could lead to jobs in the future, reduce unemployment rates and help to address the UK skills gap. The more that employers play an active role in developing young people, the more we can help every young person to have better working prospects now and in the future.\u201d</p> <h2>Young people\u2019s debts</h2> <p>Young people are building up debt and worrying about money in their first few years of adult life, but far too few are seeking advice when they fall behind, according to research by National Debtline, which is run by the Money Advice Trust.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s report, Borrowed Years, reveals that 18- to 24-year-olds are building up significant debts at a relatively early age and suffering widespread money worries, despite most trying to budget and actively manage their personal finances. It found that 37% are already in debt, owing an average of just under \u00a33,000 which excludes any student loans or mortgages. Over half of adults under 25 report that they regularly worry about money, with 21% admitting they lose sleep as a result.</p>",
  "<p>Portugal\u2019s former prime minister, Antonio Guterres, has consolidated a strong lead in the race to become the next United Nations secretary general, after a third security council secret ballot on Monday. </p> <p>Diplomats said that only a decisive stand by Russia, which has argued that the job should go to an eastern European, could now stop Guterres succeeding Ban Ki-moon in the UN\u2019s top job. A fourth straw poll is expected in September in the hope that a consensus forms around a winner by October. </p> <p>In a succession of straw polls by secret ballot, the 15 security council members vote whether to encourage, discourage or express no opinion about a candidate. Results of Monday\u2019s poll supplied by diplomats <a href=\"http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/UN-ELECTION/0100213T2QL/index.html\">showed 11 members</a> voted to \u201cencourage\u201d Guterres, who served as the UN high commissioner for refugees for a decade.</p> <p>That was the same level of support as the previous vote, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/pga/70/2016/08/05/statement-on-second-informal-straw-poll-of-security-council-for-position-of-secretary-general/\">on 5 August</a>, but the number of discourage votes rose from two to three, with just one voicing no opinion. </p> <p>Miroslav Lajcak, the Slovak foreign minister, was a surprise runner-up, rising from 10th place out of 11 contenders earlier this month. In joint third position were Vuk Jeremic, a former Serbian foreign minister, and Irina Bokova, a former Bulgarian foreign minister and director-general of Unesco, the UN education and cultural organisation, and the last serious hope for those who wanted a woman to take the world\u2019s top diplomatic job for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cThis really widens the gap in the race. It shows Guterres\u2019s lead has stabilised,\u201d a diplomat at the UN said. There was widespread speculation that either Russia or a Russian ally on the council had switched from no opinion to an anti-Guterres vote.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe real question is whether this discourage vote is tactical, in order to exact a price for Russian agreement, or whether it is substantial and they are saying: we don\u2019t want him,\u201d the diplomat said.</p> <p>Russia and the four other permanent council members \u2013 the US, UK, France and China \u2013 all have the power to block a candidacy. Although this secretary general race has been far more open than previous contests, the winner will still have to be agreed by the five permanent members, as before.</p> <p>Lajcak\u2019s dramatic rise makes him a feasible compromise candidate if Russia remains adamant on Guterres, though he received five discourage votes. It is not known whether there were permanent members among those five votes. </p> <p>A number of candidates who fared poorly in the latest straw poll will now be under pressure to drop out of the race. They include Moldova\u2019s former foreign minister Natalia Gherman, and the UN\u2019s former climate chief, Christiana Figueres. Helen Clark, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/helen-clark-former-new-zealand-prime-minister-confirms-bid-for-united-nations-top-job\">early favourite</a> backed by several western capitals, got eight discourage votes in the against only six backing her. Diplomats said she would now face a tough decision on whether to stay in the race. </p> <p>Matthew Rycroft, Britain\u2019s ambassador to the UN, urged low-scoring candidates to pull out, to help winnow the field in the last stage of the race. </p> <p>\u201cI would encourage them to look at are they going to get to nine positive votes and no vetoes. And if they are, then great \u2013 they should stay in the race,\u201d Rycroft said before Monday\u2019s vote, adding that \u201cif that\u2019s a long way off\u201d they should follow the example of earlier contenders who had withdrawn. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2016. An earlier version said Helen Clark received five votes backing her in the third ballot; she received six.</p>",
  "<p>The market leaders in the betting for this season\u2019s Flat jockeys\u2019 championship swapped places for the second time in three days on Monday, as Silvestre de Sousa and Jim Crowley went head-to-head on the bank holiday card at Epsom Downs on what proved a one-sided afternoon. De Sousa started the day two winners behind Crowley but surged into the lead with victories in the first four races.</p> <p>El Astronaute, an 11-4 chance for the Indigenous Handicap over five furlongs, was the only favourite in De Sousa\u2019s four-timer, which also included wins on Hurricane Rush (11-4), Ancient Astronaut (4-1) and Goodwood Zodiac (5-2) at combined odds of 245-1. Crowley, who had replaced De Sousa as the title favourite on Monday morning after riding 20 winners in a fortnight, drew a blank from five rides at Epsom, including a half-length second to Hurricane Rush aboard the 6-5 favourite, Firefright.</p> <p>De Sousa was odds-on for last year\u2019s title from early July, when Ryan Moore sustained an injury which kept him out of action until September. Richard Hughes\u2019s decision to retire from the saddle a couple of weeks later allowed the Brazilian rider to coast home 36 winners clear of his nearest rival, with 132 victories in all.</p> <p>This year\u2019s riders\u2019 championship, however, seems sure to be much closer and could yet run all the way to Champions Day at Ascot on 15 October, which marks the official conclusion of the title race.</p> <p>De Sousa, two clear of his main rival with 81 winners, is now odds-on once again to retain the championship with most bookmakers, although William Hill still offer even money. Crowley, meanwhile, is an 11-10 chance with Stan James, creating a 97.5% book at the best prices available about the front two which underlines the nip-and-tuck nature of this year\u2019s race.</p> <p>\u201cI feel no pressure,\u201d De Sousa said after his third win of the day. \u201cI feel as good as the ride I have. Things are going well, the treble helps and I hope to keep it going.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/26/ryan-moore-back-injury-spatial-newmarket\">Ryan Moore back from injury with a bang aboard Spatial at Newmarket</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jamie Codd, Ireland\u2019s leading amateur rider over jumps, added a victory at the home of the Derby to a record that includes success at the Cheltenham and Aintree Festivals when Hubertas, the 3-1 favourite, took the Amateur Derby over the Classic trip of 12 furlongs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to do this on my first ride here,\u201d Codd said. \u201cWhen you see it on TV, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s daunting, but when you ride it, there\u2019s a massive pull for the first five furlongs and even the camber in the home straight is quite tricky. I was probably there too soon, but my excuse is I\u2019m a jump jockey.\u201d</p> <p>Limato, the July Cup winner, has re-emerged as a contender for the Group One 32Red Sprint Cup at Haydock Park on Saturday having seemingly been ruled out by Henry Candy, his trainer, after finishing second in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York earlier this month.</p> <p>Candy also has Twilight Son, last year\u2019s winner, among the five-day entries for Saturday\u2019s race and the ground at Haydock is likely to determine which of his Group One-winning sprinters lines up. Limato would prefer a sound surface while Twilight Son likes some cut in the ground and could wait for the Champions Sprint at Ascot in October if the going is too fast this weekend.</p> <p>\u201cIf it came up too firm for Twilight Son and, if Limato looked in the sort of form that he could cope with it, then he\u2019d run,\u201d Candy said. \u201cIt would be the closest [gap] between races he\u2019s ever attempted.\u201d</p> <p>Limato was the 3-1 favourite for Saturday\u2019s race when the market opened but was taken out of the betting after his run at York. He is now back in the betting as the 5-1 second-favourite behind Quiet Reflection, the Commonwealth Cup winner at Royal Ascot, at 9-2.</p> <p>David Wachman, who has saddled the 1,000 Guineas winner in both England and Ireland, said on Monday that he will retire from training at the end of the season.</p> <p>\u201cAfter much deliberation I have decided to hand in my trainer\u2019s licence at the end of this season,\u201d Wachman, who trained Legatissimo to win the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket last season, said in a statement. \u201cWhile not taken easily, the decision to retire will allow me to spend more time with my family as well as pursuing various other business interests.\u201d</p> <p>Wachman, who is 45, started training in 1996 and moved to his current stable near Cashel in 2002 after marrying Kate Magnier, whose father John heads the Coolmore Stud\u2019s racing and bloodstock syndicate. His other big-race winners included Again, in the 2009 Irish 1,000 Guineas, and Bushranger in the 2008 Middle Park Stakes.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last 20 years I have trained for many wonderful owners and I would like to extend my deepest gratitude and thanks to them as they have been absolutely central to the success that we have enjoyed here,\u201d Wachman said.</p> <p>\u201cThe nature of training is such that you have plenty of ups and downs but I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have many good days and train some top-class horses during that time. Also a big thank you also goes to each and every one of my staff members for their unwavering loyalty, dedication and commitment and I wish them all the very best for future.\u201d</p>",
