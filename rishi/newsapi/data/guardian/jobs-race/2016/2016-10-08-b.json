  "<p><strong>Before the referendum the <em>Observer</em> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/16/leave-or-remain-black-country-businessmen-argue-for-and-against-brexit\" title=\"\"><strong>spoke to two Midlands manufacturers on either side of the Brexit debate</strong></a><strong>. More than three months later the economic news is better than had been forecast, but the pound has tumbled. Here they report back on how the decision to leave has affected their Black Country businesses so far.</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Leaver</strong></h2> <p>Andrew Cox and most of his 25-strong workforce voted to leave. He wanted the UK to free itself from the constraints of EU membership and look further afield for export opportunities.</p> <p>Cox has just returned from trade shows in Poland where, between heated discussions with Polish friends over the UK\u2019s future, he has been taking a flurry of inquiries from potential clients. The pound is a big factor in that jump in demand. His company, Cox &amp; Plant, makes 70% of its \u00a37m annual turnover from exports. From a factory in Lye, it sells production-line machinery to food manufacturers around the world and the drop in sterling since the Brexit vote has just made that machinery a whole lot cheaper.</p> <p>\u201cThe volume of inquiries and quotations has gone through the roof. We have had three orders from America since the middle of August, all based on the fact that the pound is slumping against the dollar,\u201d says Cox.</p> <p>The pound\u2019s drop against the euro is similarly helpful. \u201cIn Poland, one of the guys said to me, \u2018this is the easiest 15% discount I have ever negotiated\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The domestic market is also improving. \u201cInitially, there was almost paralysis in the sector,\u201d says Cox. \u201cBut the home market has been very, very buoyant in the last seven weeks because the data started to filter through, people became more confident and people weren\u2019t going to the wall \u2013 and we didn\u2019t get Armageddon as forecast.\u201d</p> <p>The company buys a small proportion of its raw materials, such as stainless steel, from abroad and such imports have become more expensive with the pound\u2019s fall. But for Cox, the upsides of the weak pound have more than offset the downsides. Investment and hiring plans are on track.</p> <p>With the pound so low, Cox believes more UK businesses should be looking to increase exports. But in his experience as board director for exports on the Black Country local enterprise partnership (LEP), many companies lack the confidence to broach new markets and the government is not giving them enough support. \u201cThe Department for International Trade needs massive investment and it needs troops on the ground,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As for what he wants from Brexit, Cox wants easy market access to continue: \u201cThe worst scenario for me would be to go back to the nightmare paper trails that we used to have to do with exporting to Europe.\u201d</p> <p>On immigration, he worries politicians could push for rules that hamper the UK. \u201cI just hope things don\u2019t get silly \u2026 We have got some great talent in the UK and we\u2019ve got some great talent coming into the UK.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aba04c4487533be38933f026dc8929223c50ebe0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aba04c4487533be38933f026dc8929223c50ebe0/0_276_5622_3374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Cox and Simon Winfield\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cox and Winfield are both suffering from higher import costs, but to significantly differing degrees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Fox/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The Remainer</strong></h2> <p>Simon Winfield runs MacLellan Rubber, a 145-year-old business in Wednesfield supplying products such as seals and rubber matting to other manufacturers. He felt remaining in the EU and its market of 500 million people was the better option for his business, for the UK economy and for younger generations. Having digested the shock of the vote, he says things remain \u201cvery tough\u201d.</p> <p>Like Cox\u2019s business, MacLellan has seen some boost to exports from the weak pound. But overseas sales are only around 30% of the company\u2019s \u00a32.8m in annual sales. The larger, domestic part of the business has been dented by uncertainty among clients and the pound\u2019s fall. The company imports raw materials such as plastics and rubber from Malaysia, China and other countries and pays for them in dollars. \u201cIn effect we\u2019ve had a 15% increase in our material costs which we are struggling to pass on to our customers,\u201d says Winfield.</p> <p>The company\u2019s premium products are less sensitive to the pound and are higher margin, so that has cushioned some of the blow from costlier imports.Stronger demand from mainland Europe has also helped. \u201cBut that has not offset that downturn in the UK yet,\u201d adds Winfield.</p> <p>His business in the UK depends on other manufacturers upgrading or expanding their plants and so his order book offers early clues on the sector\u2019s health. Right now, people are putting off decisions, he says. \u201cThey are just waiting to see is the demand still there, do they need to invest elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>He also hopes the UK will retain easy access to export markets. \u201cIf there are 15 pages of documents you have got to get stamped at the local chamber of commerce and we\u2019ve got to be filling in additional paperwork, that will just hamper us immensely.\u201d</p> <p>But overall he tries to strike an optimistic tone. The company, which employs 15 people, is launching new products and looking for ways to replace any lost business, and Winfield feels others are doing the same.</p> <p>\u201cI am a true believer in the British grit to get out there and do a great job and overcome issues, which is what I see happening at the moment.\u201d</p> <h2>BOSSES\u2019 BREXIT VIEWS</h2>",
  "<p>Chris Coleman was explaining the change in mentality, pointing out how there was a time when his Wales players would have folded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/wales-austria-2018-world-cup-qualifier-match-report\" title=\"\">against Austria on Thursday night</a>, when he came up with an analogy that painted a picture of the sort of obstacles that this team has got used to overcoming.</p> <p>\u201cAny success I have had has not happened overnight, the journey has never felt like me sitting in the back of a limousine sipping champagne, it has always been more like riding up a hill on a pushbike and the chain has come off,\u201d the Wales manager said. \u201cIt is that hard, it is so difficult and that is why a lot of people do not get to where they want to get to.</p> <p>\u201cOur boys, myself and the staff, we work really hard when we are together. We all face pressure and we know what we are capable of and they are prepared to do whatever it takes. It is those disappointments that bring you through. That is what hardens us to the situation we are in now.\u201d</p> <p>That situation involves taking on Georgia at home in a World Cup qualifier without two of their most creative players. Already missing Aaron Ramsey through injury, Wales must also do without Joe Allen, who is the heartbeat of the team, after Coleman confirmed that the midfielder has a hamstring problem after limping off in the 2-2 draw in Vienna.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame for us, good for Georgia,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cWith the problem Joe\u2019s got, you could play him or train him and it could go any minute. We\u2019ve had a scan and something showed up, so you have to be very careful with it. It\u2019s a shame as well with no Aaron.\u201d</p> <p>One comfort for Wales is that they have been here before. In the third match of their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign they faced Cyprus at home in the same position \u2013 without Allen and Ramsey for what was seen as a must-win game and with four points on the board. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/13/wales-cyprus-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report\" title=\"\">Wales managed to chisel out a 2-1 victory</a> on that occasion, just about hanging on at the end after playing much of the second half with 10 men.</p> <p>Georgia threatens to be another tight affair. Ranked 137th in the world, they have lost by the odd goal against Austria and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/republic-of-ireland-georgia-world-cup-2018-qualifier-match-report\" title=\"\">the Republic of Ireland in their Group D games</a>, suggesting that Wales will need to be patient and, given the absence of Ramsey and Allen, prepared to grind out a result.</p> <p>\u201cWe may have to try and get what we need in a different way and that\u2019s the challenge,\u201d said Coleman, who seems likely to bring in Dave Edwards, the Wolves midfielder, for Allen. \u201cA lot of things were said when we came back from [Euro 2016] about us taking it to the next level.</p> <p>\u201cOur style of play \u2013 I don\u2019t know what people expected of us, whether we were going to turn into Barcelona in the space of six weeks. We played Austria and we were very strong from set-plays, we caused them a lot of problems. From our perspective it\u2019s all about getting the job done.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/wales-neil-taylor-gareth-bale-austria-world-cup-qualifier\" title=\"\">Gareth Bale\u2019s long throw</a> led to one of the goals in Vienna \u2013 a tactic that may well be used again against Georgia \u2013 and the Real Madrid forward stressed the importance of making sure that the draw in Austria does not go to waste. \u201cThat could be a crucial point come the end of the campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t afford to slip up against anybody. We will be gunning for three points [against Georgia]. We want to use the last campaign as a stepping stone again.\u201d</p> <p>Wales do not have happy memories of facing Georgia. They have lost all three of the previous encounters and Coleman ruefully recalled a thumping in 1994, a game that has gone down as the nadir of his Wales career. \u201cI remember getting hammered away from home, it was 5-0,\u201d he said. \u201cAt home we lost 1-0, Vinnie Jones got sent off and Georgi Kinkladze scored from distance. They were dark days.</p> <p>\u201cThe away game was my lowest moment in a Wales shirt. But under-estimating the opposition was more of a problem for my generation; it is not a problem for this group of players.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The end of an official letter, much enlarged, frames Sadie Barnette\u2019s profile. \u201cVery truly yours,\u201d it reads, \u201cJ Edgar Hoover.\u201d Behind the 32-year-old artist is a wall covered in pink glitter. A single drawing hangs in its center, a black man\u2019s mugshot rendered in pencil.</p> <p>The images form the heart of Barnette\u2019s latest work, an installation at the Oakland Museum of California. They come from a Black Panther\u2019s FBI file \u2013 hundreds of pages recounting years of covert surveillance in search of something, anything, to pin on the activist.</p> <p>To the government, the young black man was a dangerous extremist. To Compton, his southern California home, he was a community organizer. At the museum, he is part of a new exhibition commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Black Panther party.</p> <p>To Barnette, he is a rich subject to tap for making art. He is also Dad.</p> <p>Rodney E Barnette, now a soft-spoken 72-year-old, opened the Black Panthers\u2019 Compton office. He lived with Angela Davis during her trial on murder, kidnapping and conspiracy charges. Although the FBI investigation came up empty, it cost him his job as a letter carrier for the US Postal Service.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a00669c744f8dc1cf3661e6dd9f70ff8211e8c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a00669c744f8dc1cf3661e6dd9f70ff8211e8c2/0_0_4993_3505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Black Panther Rodney Barnette with his daughter Sadie Barnette in front of an art exhibit she created in honor of him at the Oakland Museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Black Panther Rodney Barnette with his daughter Sadie Barnette in front of an art exhibit she created in honor of him at the Oakland Museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is left of the federal investigation is more than 500 pages that Sadie Barnette has turned into raw material. The documents include a veritable family tree, listing relatives\u2019 names, birthdays and military awards. There are interviews with her father\u2019s employers, his high school teachers, his childhood neighbors. FBI agents from at least eight cities were involved; their names punctuate the file and Sadie Barnette\u2019s work.</p> <p>\u201cIn a way, it feels like family history that someone might write in a family Bible,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s coming from this very aggressive, violent place of trying to dismantle what my dad was working on. The redactions, the time stamps, the hand-written notes, it makes me realize how lucky my dad is to be alive, honestly.</p> <p>\u201cBecause so many members are listed in the documents,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere\u2019s one page where it lists a bunch of different former Panther members and in parentheses [after each one] it says, \u2018deceased\u2019, \u2018deceased\u2019, \u2018deceased\u2019.

Some have big gaps where the government excised blocks of information. Others have been embellished by Sadie Barnette herself with splotches of black that resemble bullet holes or a fine mist of pink spray paint.</p> <p>There\u2019s a polaroid of Rodney Barnette \u2013 13 and smiling, surrounded by family members \u2013 and Sadie Barnette\u2019s re-creation of her father\u2019s mugshot.</p> <p>Most of the document pages can be easily deciphered. On one, there is a single sentence, recommending that Rodney Barnette be placed on a list of people who were considered an immediate threat to national security.</p> <p>\u201cMy first thought is, wow, all the time and energy they wasted,\u201d the elder Barnette said as his eyes scanned the file pages. The government \u201cwent to my neighbors where I was born \u2026 They went to my jobs. The main thing is they tried to get me fired from the job I had at the post office.</p> <p>\u201cAnd they did, based on my living with a woman that I was cohabiting with I wasn\u2019t married to,\u201d he continued. \u201cConduct unbecoming of a government employee \u2026 I\u2019m sure nobody had done that before, living with a woman they weren\u2019t married to.\u201d</p> <p>Rodney Barnette joined the Black Panthers straight out of the army as a response, he said, to police actions in the US. He had been wounded in Vietnam, was awarded a Purple Heart, \u201cwitnessed horrors over there, people died in my arms\u201d.

Thousands of people were members, and they were doing a lot of good things. It felt really good that I had joined. I didn\u2019t know it would be under such assault by the government, but that\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s my way of putting my mark on the files \u2026 we\u2019re telling the story and using the information to tell the real story</p> <footer> <cite>Sadie Barnette</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rene de Guzman, who curated All Power to the People: Black Panthers at 50, said the exhibit is a way to reclaim and explain a movement that is often viewed as simply \u201cblack men with guns.

  "<p>To make estimates about what a certain group of people are thinking, pollsters need to speak to enough people from that group. Generally speaking, though, the smaller the group, the harder it is to get respondents.
