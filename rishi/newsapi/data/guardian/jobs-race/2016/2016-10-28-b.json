  "<p>The election approaches; the nation seethes; the hatred festers; the dead start to talk. Old intolerances have come roaring back as the United States finally reaches the end of the most virulent, vacuous presidential contest in living memory. For African Americans, particularly, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/10/16/497841789/for-much-of-black-america-election-2016-has-been-rough\">the catastrophe of Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy has appeared almost as a punishment</a> for the election of the first black president, and the overt, unashamed racism of his campaign, leavened with promises of violence, has affirmed that American history does not have an inbuilt happy ending.</p> <p>In any other year, the recently opened retrospective of the paintings of <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/press/exhibitions/2016/kerry-james-marshall\">Kerry James Marshall </a>at New York\u2019s Met Breuer would be a significant event. Against the current backdrop of racist demagoguery and national disbelief, it arrives as a godsend. This stone-cold stunner of a retrospective \u2013 spanning two floors of the Met\u2019s luxury rental on Madison Avenue, and organized with judicious restraint by <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/now-at-the-met/features/2013/spectrum-spotlight-ian-alteveer\">Ian Alteveer </a>and Meredith Brown \u2013 proudly insists on the place of African Americans in the American artistic imagination. And yet that is only one of its achievements. It also, and perhaps more powerfully, grounds that placement <em>inside</em> a larger western artistic tradition, and utilizes the very tropes and techniques once used in exclusionary imagery to new, more moral ends.<strong> </strong>(The show opened last April at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Marshall\u2019s hometown; <a href=\"http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/first-lady-michelle-obama-visited-the-museum-of-contemporary-art/\">Michelle Obama made time to see it</a>. It travels next year to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01449a4372b248a88e1e44ddf3b1e88a3d9dcf37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01449a4372b248a88e1e44ddf3b1e88a3d9dcf37/0_0_4078_5005/815.jpg\" alt=\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self, 1980\" width=\"815\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self, 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Fried, \u00a9 MCA Chicago/Kerry James Marshall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Its 72 paintings skitter and shamble through the history of art, remixing its styles and redeploying its genres, though running through all Marshall\u2019s art, like a tonic note, is flesh of uniform, dense, light-absorbing black. Not the shades of brown skin we misleadingly call \u201cblack\u201d, but <em>black</em>. It\u2019s achieved through the admixture of several different pigments \u2013 coal black, or an ivory black produced from charred bones, or else something called <a href=\"http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=591544\">mars black</a>, which is made from iron oxide. The blacks gain further richness through blue or golden undertones, but no white is mixed into the pigment to model the actual flesh tones of African Americans.</p> <p>His small, breakthrough painting <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/kerry-james-marshall-a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-shadow-of-his-former-self\">A Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self</a> (1980) features a man whose jet-black skin just barely can be distinguished from the dark gray background. A fedora perches on his head cartoonishly, and teeth and eyeballs disrupt the crepuscular surface with shocks of white. Lean into this disturbing, uncanny work when you encounter the portrait in one of the early galleries here. At first the indeterminate, half-visible figure appears an instantiation of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/invisible-man.html\">Ralph Ellison\u2019s invisible man</a>. Seen up close, the portrait\u2019s gemlike hardness recalls the exactitude, but also the opacity, of Flemish portraiture \u2013 and, indeed, this is a rare work done with old-style, fast-drying egg tempera, rather than the malleable acrylic he would later embrace. (The exhibition\u2019s title, Mastry, is a brilliant, misspelled rejoinder to the old designation of skilled northern European artists as masters.) This \u201cshadow\u201d of Marshall has been cast by Renaissance depictions and minstrel shows alike, and by the constraints of not just American life but European high art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06dc2ad5a7085c29681498ea05635b75fc09845e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06dc2ad5a7085c29681498ea05635b75fc09845e/0_0_3250_2247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Souvenir I, 1997\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Souvenir I, 1997.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Ziolkowski, \u00a9 MCA Chicago/Kerry James Marshall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Marshall\u2019s uncanny, intense blackness has both a personal derivation and a conceptual underpinning. His figures are not faithful depiction of black individuals. They\u2019re signs, and they channel and frustrate a centuries-long history of representations of blackness as evil, inferior, or simply absent \u2013 before then, gloriously, asserting the prestige afforded to those representations as Marshall\u2019s rightful inheritance. Marshall paints barbershops and housing projects, spaces of black community and independence, and he also frequently turns to interiors: black people in bed, in their living room, reading a book, listening to music. But these depictions are not ends in themselves, any more than C\u00e9zanne\u2019s still lifes are advertisements for apples. His black-pitched portraits and genre scenes gain their force, rather, from the historical tradition they partially embrace, partially refute, and ultimately expand.</p> <p>Sometimes Marshall can dip into a citational mode that gets a bit facile, a bit look-what-I-know, as in a barbershop panorama that features a cartoon white girl in the manner of <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\">the distorted skull in Holbein\u2019s Ambassadors</a>. He is far better when he trusts his art history to serve as the mood music for his contemporary visions, above all in the largest gallery of this retrospective: a suite of nine giant paintings of Chicago and Los Angeles housing projects, plus suburban landscapes that wink heavily at the pastoral tradition. A black family sprawled out at a lakeside picnic recalls, but hardly imitates, the bourgeois snackers of <a href=\"http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=7123\">Manet\u2019s D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019Herbe</a>; children in an LA project frolic in the grass like rococo pleasure-seekers, and paintball-like flowers stud the painting\u2019s surface.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8e47a6777ac79f27cf15d62a1c1697e353aca08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e47a6777ac79f27cf15d62a1c1697e353aca08/0_0_5233_3014/1000.jpg\" alt=\"7am Sunday Morning, 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">7am Sunday Morning, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerry James Marshall/Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These paintings draw on art history not as a crutch, and not as a clapback. They draw on the past as a set of procedures, which Marshall combines and reworks to depict black bodies with a sophistication and intricacy usually not afforded them. Only that way, Marshall seems to insist, can black lives be seen as lives that matter. You can neither junk the past nor outrun it, but you can recode its values, and make the past your own. (A pendant show here, Kerry James Marshall Selects, offers a revealing glimpse of the artist\u2019s sources and inspirations: a stern portrait from the workshop of Hans Holbein, flowing figure studies by Veronese, <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/491419\">a social-realist lithograph</a> by his former teacher Charles Wilbert White, and <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/267361\">a photograph of Gerhard Richter\u2019s wife, smudged with paint</a>.)</p> <p>The very conception of western artistic beauty, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124700316\">as the historian Nell Irvin Painter has written</a>, springs from a racialized misunderstanding of the Greek ideal, as 18th-century aesthetes elevated the white marbles they venerated into the very standard of elegance. (Greek marbles were initially painted, and the Prussians who were beginning to write art history were looking at Roman copies anyway.) That makes Marshall\u2019s multifarious visions \u2013 of black bodies convulsed with pleasure, black bodies racked with pain; black people as heroes, as everyday Joes \u2013 a necessary expansion of the vocabulary of art. But such representations, while necessary, are not sufficient in themselves, and it would be an insult to reduce Marshall\u2019s achievement to a mere emendation of past ills.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9490f4a92f1357736ad39e35cb9b6cfa2a2470c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9490f4a92f1357736ad39e35cb9b6cfa2a2470c4/0_0_7343_4922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vignette, 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vignette, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerry James Marshall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Look, and look, and look again at the greatest of Marshall\u2019s series: his portraits of fictional painters, men and women alike, whose black skin is offset by palettes of seething rainbows of smudged pigment. A man with an afro looks directly at us, in an empty studio of chilly blue. A broad-nosed woman wearing a patterned smock stands before an in-progress canvas, seemingly a self-portrait, that slyly reveals a paint-by-numbers outline. The giant palettes they grasp by the thumbholes are old-style gestures, but these artists are undaunted by past achievements, and absorb all history as their skin absorbs all light. These painters are masters, and the man who painted these painters is a master too.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/kerry-james-marshall\"><em>Kerry James Marshall: Mastry</em></a><em> is on view at the Met Breuer, New York, through 29 January.

  "<p>Michael White, the Guardian\u2019s assistant editor, retired last week after almost 45 years at the paper as a reporter, foreign correspondent and columnist. He was political editor from 1990-2006, Washington correspondent (1984-88) and parliamentary sketch writer (1977-84). Here he reflects on his Guardian career.</p> <p><strong>When did you first know you wanted to be a journalist?</strong><br>I was never a student journalist but, after failing a few interviews for industry in my final student year, I decided \u2013 correctly \u2013 that I am by nature an observer, not a doer. I was lucky in my timing: 1966 was a very good time to embark on a career in journalism.</p> <p><strong>Do you remember your first day at the Guardian?</strong><br>I was a refugee from the reporters\u2019 desk at the London Evening Standard, where the appointment of Stuart Kuttner, later of News of the World fame, as news editor made me keen to move. On day one at the Guardian, as Derek Malcolm, who was the paper\u2019s film critic, showed me how to subedit the late arts reviews \u2013 those of Michael Billington and Nancy Banks-Smith among them \u2013 he said: \u201cDo you know, I\u2019m the only film critic in Fleet Street who still has to do this.\u201d I realised I was Derek\u2019s ticket out.</p> <p><strong>Did you always want to be political editor?</strong><br>No. But I was always interested in politics and applied for a Westminster vacancy that was earmarked for someone else, who turned it down. Within a year, I was the Guardian\u2019s sketch writer. A lucky fluke, but Machiavelli \u2013 a better observer than a doer \u2013 was right to say luck is half of everything.</p> <p><strong>Is there one job you didn\u2019t do that you would have loved to have tried?</strong><br>War is appalling and mostly to be avoided, but it has a grim fascination. I should like to have been a war correspondent, but only once.</p> <p><strong>What was your most embarrassing moment?</strong><br>When I got into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/nov/05/labour.uk\">slight fisticuffs with the Daily Mirror\u2019s political editor Alastair Campbell</a> over the death of his paper\u2019s proprietor, Robert Maxwell. \u201cIt shows there is a God,\u201d I said. I woke next day to find Alastair had been sacked by the new boss, and Fleet Street was proclaiming Maxwell a saintly hero. It was two weeks before Maxwell\u2019s hand was found to have been in the pension fund and I could emerge from the doghouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa3474de90744f6363780ba6ad1b06d8b6bc61b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3474de90744f6363780ba6ad1b06d8b6bc61b5/0_37_1379_827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Campbell,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Campbell, whom Michael White got into \u2018slight fisticuffs\u2019 with over the death of Robert Maxwell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What was your biggest scoop?</strong><br>I was never very good at finding scoops, which is just as well because I am a scoop sceptic. A few reporters are brilliant at it, but most \u201cscoops\u201d aren\u2019t what they are cracked up to be. There are usually only half a dozen real crackers a year. I value sound judgment of known facts more highly. Pompous, I realise.</p> <p><strong>Is there a story that you wish you had written?</strong><br>I never wrote my best scoop. In the mid-1990s, a well-placed Tory MP told me the Provisional IRA was in ceasefire talks with John Major\u2019s government. I couldn\u2019t get a second source and it was too serious an issue to take a punt on. People might have been killed. And did my source have a suspect ulterior motive? The story was true, but I don\u2019t regret my caution.</p> <p><strong>What has been the Guardian\u2019s greatest moment during your career? </strong><br>There have been many, none prompted by me; battles with government \u2013 I admire Edward Snowden as I did not Julian Assange \u2013 and risky libel victories. When we beat Neil Hamilton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/08/uk\">and Jonathan Aitken</a>, even Dennis Skinner was impressed. The crime reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/23/duncan-campbell-cops-robbers-and-me\">Duncan Campbell\u2019s win</a> over corruption at Stoke Newington nick impressed me greatly because he wrote so modestly about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b048e37983b64b27ef5bd1df62f2a9314b71a24b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b048e37983b64b27ef5bd1df62f2a9314b71a24b/0_106_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael White interviews former prime minister Tony Blair in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael White interviews former prime minister Tony Blair in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Which of the journalists who you have worked with do you most admire?</strong><br>I have admired and deplored all my editors, loved my Westminster colleagues, notably Ian Aitken and the much-missed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/06/simon-hoggart-guardian-observer-journalist-dies-67\">Simon Hoggart</a>, the naughty boy. I admired the leader writer and war hero <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/my-mentor-charles-wheeler-on-mark-arnold-forster-421320.html\">Mark Arnold-Forster</a> and Mick Downing, father of the NUJ chapel, because they were both understated, and idealistic without being naive, though I would prefer to have been marooned on a desert island with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/28/posy-simmonds-tamara-drewe-interview\">the great cartoonist Posy Simmonds</a>.

  "<p>Almost all human beings have the capacity for empathy. Everyone has the potential to be at least troubled, or feel genuine anguish, about the suffering of other human beings. We recognise that, like us, other humans have insecurities and ambitions; we fall in love and have relationships that end in heartbreak; we worry about our children\u2019s wellbeing; we say things we regret; we\u2019re occasionally kept awake by fears or worries; and we try to impress people we look up to.

But it is pointless to pretend there is much support for the cause of refugees. As a group their humanity has been systematically stripped away. They are not like you, or your family, or your neighbours. Rather they are seen as a collective blob composed of faceless deceitful criminals, potential rapists and murderers who will steal homes, jobs and resources.

The responses were not representative of the decent majority: they were extreme sentiments but nonetheless instructive. \u201cI\u2019m sorry are we meant to feel sorry for these criminals??\u201d, asked one. \u201cOh well one less to drain Britain\u2019s economy got no sympathy for them,\u201d said another. \u201cNearly made it \u2026 bet was chuffed to bits!!!\u201d cackled another.

However these are not sociopaths, who make up a tiny fraction of the population. And there is a significant difference between glibly embracing a stranger\u2019s death on Twitter and killing them yourself.</p> <p>But the truth is that much of the violence throughout our species\u2019 bloodstained history was not inflicted by people incapable of empathy. Atrocities were committed by people who, in other scenarios, would help a pensioner cross the road, smile endearingly at a stranger\u2019s infant in a train carriage, or come to the assistance of someone they\u2019d never met before who was in distress.</p> <p>In the Balkan wars of the 1990s, neighbours, colleagues, even friends, <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2022-6-awful-things-i-learned-surviving-genocide.html\">murdered one another</a>. It didn\u2019t matter who they were: they were members of a group who, it was believed, posed an existential threat to the killers\u2019 own community. Western colonialism was predicated on stripping humanity away from colonial subjects. Pseudo-scientists and anthropologists developed theories of Africans being innately inferior to people of European origin. Until 1967, Indigenous Australians were regulated by the country\u2019s law as <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/world-news/asia-pacific/aborigines-mark-40-years-as-human-beings-26293153.html\">\u201cflora and fauna\u201d</a>: they were officially wildlife, like the kangaroo.

Stripping away the humanity of Jews, Slavs and other \u201cundesirables\u201d was a precondition to murdering them. In the Polish town of Poznan in October 1943, Heinrich Himmler officially <a href=\"http://ww2history.com/key_moments/Holocaust/Himmler_s_Posen_speech\">confirmed</a> the Nazi Holocaust. \u201cWe must be honest, decent, loyal and comradely to members of our own blood and to nobody else,\u201d he declared.</p> <p>There is no systematic industrialised attempt to exterminate millions of people today, but hundreds of thousands have perished in Syria\u2019s killing fields, and the UN describes the treatment of Yazidis as genocide. Our grim history is littered with other reminders of the logical extremes of dehumanisation. As social neuroscientist Professor Tania Singer <a href=\"https://www.cogneurosociety.org/empathy_pain/\">puts it</a>, a \u201cnatural capacity for empathic resonance can easily be blocked \u2013 not just in psychopaths \u2013 but in all of us: simply because we think someone was unfair or is not belonging to \u2018our tribe\u2019\u201d. This is a theme that I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/28/hillsborough-could-happen-again-police-views-liverpool-fans\">continually return to</a> because the corruption of shared humanity is at the heart of injustice.</p> <p>It also provides clues about how we might respond. Political linguists have argued that the right often uses stories to make an argument, while the left falls back on facts and statistics. But we\u2019re human beings, not machines. Take the refugee crisis. What, at least momentarily, shifted attitudes? It was when a little Kurdish boy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/shocking-image-of-drowned-syrian-boy-shows-tragic-plight-of-refugees\">Alan Kurdi</a>, washed up dead on a Turkish beach.

I often recall the case of Stephen Taylor, a 60-year old army veteran who had his benefits stopped because he wasn\u2019t actively seeking work. Instead he was <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/war-hero-stephen-taylors-benefits-2895202\">volunteering for the Royal Legion</a>, raising money for injured former comrades. It\u2019s a story that always provokes a sharp intake of breath: mentioning the hundreds of thousands who have had their benefits stopped does not. Similarly, responding to a Daily Mail story about a benefit \u201cscrounger\u201d living in luxury with the government\u2019s own estimate of benefit fraud \u2013 that is, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/371459/Statistical_Release.pdf\">0.7% of social security spending</a> \u2013 doesn\u2019t work. The story trumps the statistic.</p> <p>Injustice becomes less tolerable if the victims are human beings rather than cockroaches. Dehumanisation leads to the tolerance of suffering at best, to murder at worst. Restoring our shared humanity isn\u2019t easy, not least because powerful interests \u2013 from media outlets to politicians \u2013 relentlessly seek to undermine it. But it is the only hope for a troubled world.</p>"
