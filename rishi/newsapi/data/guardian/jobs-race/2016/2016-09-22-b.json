  "<p>Labor is preparing to launch a proposal to invite all federal parliamentarians to sign up to a code of race ethics, echoing an initiative advanced by the ALP and the Australian Democrats during the period Pauline Hanson was last in parliament.</p> <p>The code is yet to clear Labor\u2019s caucus processes, but the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has told Guardian Australia it would be an important gesture for the 45th parliament. \u201cIt would send a message about what sort of parliament we want to be,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/we-cant-eradicate-racism-but-telling-its-targets-to-grin-and-bear-it-isnt-good-enough\">We can't eradicate racism but telling its targets to grin and bear it isn't good enough | Tim Soutphommasane</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The previous code of race ethics was pursued by the then Labor senator Margaret Reynolds and the Democrat senator John Woodley in 1996, prompted by concern about the debate about racism that erupted in that year\u2019s election campaign.</p> <p>The code required parliamentarians to sign on to a set of principles, including respect for religious and cultural diversity, supporting tolerance and justice within a multicultural society, and \u201cto speak and write in a manner which provides factual commentary on a foundation of truth about all issues being debated in the community and the parliament\u201d.</p> <p>Dreyfus indicated that the wording for Labor\u2019s proposal would be similar to the Reynolds/Woodley initiative, which won support from 54% of parliamentarians. He said assuming that the proposal cleared Labor\u2019s internal deliberations, he would invite all parliamentarians to sign on.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s move follows Hanson\u2019s declaration in her first speech in the Senate that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">Australia was in danger of being \u201cswamped\u201d by Muslims</a>. It comes as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/21/race-discrimination-commissioner-criticises-pauline-hanson-for-stoking-division\">new polling suggests 49% of Australians support One Nation\u2019s call for a ban on Muslim immigration</a>.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, used a speech at the Australian National University this week to warn about the dangers of politicians fanning xenophobic sentiment.</p> <p>In an interview with Guardian Australia\u2019s Australian politics live podcast, he warned the country was approaching a tipping point in race relations. \u201cMake no mistake, we are in a time when our values and our harmony are being tested, and we need to rise to this test and ensure we live up to the best of our traditions as a nation of immigration,\u201d Soutphommasane said.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the political rhetoric we are hearing at the moment is taking us down a very different path.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a real danger that we are normalising what might otherwise be unacceptable ideas</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Soutphommasane</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He said people declaring in the parliament that Muslims weren\u2019t welcome, or people arguing for a watering down of protections in the Racial Discrimination Act, needed to focus on the consequences of their statements, rather than think they were engaged in an abstract philosophical debate.</p> <p>\u201cIf people are worried about Muslim immigrants integrating into Australian society they should remember that telling Muslims they are not welcome is going to do nothing to aid migrants of a Muslim background becoming acquainted with Australian culture, or feeling that they belong to our society \u2013 and that\u2019s the best way to integrate migrants, to ensure they receive a fair go, and they get the time they need for them and their families to settle in and contribute to our country,\u201d Soutphommasane said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a largely cohesive, harmonious and stable society, so to see these explosions of anxiety is concerning. I wouldn\u2019t want to see it deteriorate.</p> <p>\u201cAnd here we need to think about the effect it\u2019s going to have on our daily lives. When you see or hear hostility being vented against Muslims in our political debate that\u2019s going to affect how the young Muslim schoolboy or schoolgirl is going to experience life in the schoolyard. Having that kind of exclusion is no recipe for societal cohesion.\u201d</p> <p>The race discrimination commissioner said people who want to remove the words offend and insult from the Racial Discrimination Act often failed to point out that the legislation was not some broad-ranging prohibition, but a specific form of protection. The commissioner said section 18C of the act was about nipping racial hatred in the bud, and preventing it escalating into actual violence.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe Racial Discrimination Act covers acts which offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate on the basis of race,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very different thing to offending or insulting on the basis of the football team you support.</p> <p>\u201cPogroms have never been organised, as far as I know, on the basis of the football teams you support. But pogroms have been organised against people on the basis of race and their background.\u201d</p> <p>He also responded to the Essential poll that found 49% support for banning Muslim immigration. \u201cI was surprised and very concerned \u2026 because we\u2019ve had a non-discriminatory immigration policy for many years.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/01/the-debate-about-18c-doesnt-have-to-be-a-left-right-slanging-match\">The debate about 18C doesn't have to be a left-right slanging match | Gay Alcorn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the poll was out of sync with other field evidence which confirmed there was broad-ranging community support for a non-discriminatory immigration policy.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers may reflect where the debate is at the moment. We have seen about two months of blanket coverage of Ms Hanson, not a week goes by when you don\u2019t see or hear her views about immigration and Islam, and there\u2019s a real danger that we are normalising what might otherwise be unacceptable ideas, beyond the bounds of a liberal democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Again, Soutphommasane urged people to focus on the practical consequences flowing from their statements.</p> <p>\u201cConsider what the full implications of discriminating on the basis of religion will mean. If this is carried out, our immigration officials at our airports and ports are going to have to make calls about who is going to pass and who isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSound familiar? Well this is what we did during the white Australia policy.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>Dieter Meier is apologetic. We have to be quick with the interview, he says, because he is leaving Zurich for Cuba later today. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy some cacao beans,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m starting a chocolate factory here in Zurich.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry? A chocolate factory? \u201cBased on a new patented process of a cold extraction from the cacao bean,\u201d he explains. \u201cNormally, the cacao is toasted, then ground, and you lose 90% of the aroma from all these heat processes.\u201d And then he\u2019s off. How normal chocolate is full of artificial aromas. How his chocolate is so flavoursome you can tell whether the beans that made it came from Java or Grenada or Cuba. How the Swiss chocolate industry attempted to buy the patent process of cold extraction from the scientist who invented it in order to stop anyone from using it. How the scientist contacted him because Meier has a \u201clittle coffee situation\u201d in the Dominican Republic where the ripe coffee berries are harvested by hand, not industrially, \u201cwhich makes my coffee quite expensive, but gives it a&#xa0;totally different flavour\u201d. How he recently turned up at a chocolate convention and started handing out leaflets about his revolutionary new process, \u201clike a communist\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d he says eventually, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to <a href=\"http://www.zurichkreis8.ch/menschen/im-gespraech-mit-dieter-meier.html\" title=\"\">talk about chocolate</a>, right?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S_oVewhxrg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0S_oVewhxrg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Yello\u2019s new album and gigs in Berlin</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Indeed. I am supposed to be in Zurich talking about the new Yello album, Toy&#xa0;\u2013 \u201ca return to the roots of Yello\u201d, as&#xa0;Meier\u2019s musical partner Boris Blank puts it \u2013 and their forthcoming gigs in Berlin. These will be the first time the duo have performed live, unless you count a performance at a multimedia art event in a Zurich cinema weeks after they formed in 1978, at which Blank declined to appear on stage. Instead, he lurked in the orchestra pit (\u201cIn case it was a huge disaster,\u201d notes Meier, \u201cthen people would think there was only one idiot involved\u201d). There was also a 15-minute \u201cpresentation\u201d at New York\u2019s Roxy Club in 1983.</p> <p>Meier is hugely excited about their belated return to the stage, enthusing about the \u201copera-like\u201d qualities of their music and the gigs he played recently with his side project <a href=\"http://www.outofchaos.de/\" title=\"\">Out of Chaos</a> (\u201cTo&#xa0;be an entertainer on stage \u2013 I truly love it\u201d). Blank, on the other hand, still carries the distinctly cautious aura of a man who might be happier hiding in an orchestra pit. \u201cI was never a big \u2018shake your head and move your ass and pretend to play a synthesiser\u2019 guy,\u201d he offers. \u201cNow it\u2019s a bit different, we have other musicians on stage. But,\u201d he frowns, \u201cI am still afraid to do this.\u201d</p> <p>The thing is, while my interview with Blank proceeds relatively normally \u2013 albeit punctuated by the sound of the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yellofier/id622611915?mt=8\" title=\"\">Yellofier</a>, an iPhone app he recently invented and is keen to demonstrate at considerable volume \u2013 my conversation with Meier keeps getting sidetracked. He proudly describes himself as a dilettante (\u201cA very positive word; someone who did not systematically learn something and starts with their own personality\u201d). As well as being the frontman of Yello \u2013 and indeed the pioneer of a revolutionary new cacao extraction process and owner of a little coffee situation in the Dominican Republic \u2013 he is variously: <a href=\"http://www.ojodeagua.ch/en/wine/vineyard\" title=\"\">a winemaker and a producer of organic beef</a> (he owns a vineyard and cattle ranch in Argentina \u2013 his malbec-cabernet sauvignon-cabernet franc is apparently to die for); <a href=\"http://www.ojodeagua.de\" title=\"\">a restaurateur</a>; an actor and film director; a former professional gambler; a celebrated performance artist; an author; photographer; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/02/style/yesterday-s-soda-can-today-s-swiss-watch.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">designer of watches</a>, silk scarves and sports cars; a former leading Swiss golfer (that one is hard to verify, it should be said); and one of the developers of \u201cthe first fully digital mixing console for music and film\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4QbJRAWvRU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y4QbJRAWvRU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for the 1988 hit The Race</figcaption> </figure>   <p>He says that if he had to do one thing, \u201cof course, I would always try to work with Boris\u201d, but when he talks, all the other stuff he does keeps coming up. The way a poker game is \u201ca macrocosm of life \u2013 every new hand is your fate and you can play with your fate\u201d. How the first fully digital mixing console for music and film got a bad press in the US when an engineer using one at CNN inadvertently broadcast the sound of two miked-up female reporters having \u201ca very intensive sex&#xa0;talk\u201d in a lavatory, instead of a George W Bush speech, and blamed the equipment. He talks about Beethoven, Goya and El Greco, and at one juncture uses the word \u201cepigone\u201d, which I subsequently have to <a href=\"http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/epigone\" title=\"\">look up in a dictionary</a>.</p> <p>It goes without saying that this is both pretty fascinating and not the normal kind of conversation you have when you interview a musician. But then, even without Meier\u2019s plethora of outside interests, Yello would still seem nothing like a normal kind of band. With their suits and cravats and moustaches, Meier and Blank look less like pop stars than two men you might see on the deck of a yacht, champagne flutes in hand.</p> <p>Their history is deeply odd. They seem to have formed by mistake. A mutual acquaintance introduced Meier \u2013 who had graduated from \u201cmaking noises with my voice when I presented my experimental movies\u201d to a brief career as a punk vocalist \u2013 to Boris Blank, a TV repair man and fan of Throbbing Gristle who was making experimental electronic music with a friend called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Per%C3%B3n\" title=\"\">Carlos Per\u00f3n</a>. Meier had no plans to pursue a career as a singer or form a band; Blank hated punk and didn\u2019t want to work with a vocalist. Their meeting, Meier says, was \u201ca double disaster for Boris. He felt as if he was a sound painter, doing electronic music, and even a brilliant singer would be putting extra brushstrokes on his work. And I was a very bad singer.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU0Ypufo6BM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SU0Ypufo6BM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for the 1985 single Oh Yeah</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Still, they kept working together, discovering a shared sense of very dry, oddball humour that percolates throughout their oeuvre, from track titles to album sleeves to videos: \u201cIt\u2019s not like we say \u2018we\u2019ve got to do some humour, people will like this\u2019,\u201d notes Blank, \u201cit\u2019s just what happens when both of us are around together.\u201d</p> <p>Their intention was to be a very&#xa0;arty, leftfield entity \u2013 their first two albums were released on Ralph, the label run by legendary San Fransciso avant-gardists <a href=\"http://www.theresidents.co.uk\" title=\"\">the Residents</a> \u2013 but quickly became something else entirely, again seemingly by accident. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJFShE1VfEc\" title=\"\">Their 1981 single Bostich</a>, a confection of relentless synthesiser, disco beats and Meier\u2019s \u201cpercussive\u201d vocals, became a huge hit on black radio in the&#xa0;US. \u201cThey thought we were two black guys rapping,\u201d says Blank, still bemused, \u201cnot music from the cheese-and-chocolate land.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/14/popandrock.shopping7\">CD: Yello, Solid Pleasure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Weirder still, Yello next became proper pop stars, without intending to.&#xa0;They had a string of admittedly unlikely hit singles. 1985\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2dyzd39jdA\" title=\"\">Vicious Games</a> made the US dance/club top 10; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4QbJRAWvRU\" title=\"\">The Race</a> reached No 7 in the UK in 1988; they worked with Shirley Bassey on 1987\u2019s The Rhythm Divine; the deathless <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8inB7FAPHc4\" title=\"\">Oh Yeah</a> wasn\u2019t that big a hit,&#xa0;but became almost omnipresent in&#xa0;80s cinema and TV, \u201cused,\u201d as one critic noted, \u201cwhen a movie or TV show or commercial wanted to underline the impact of a hot babe or jaw-dropping car\u201d, a state of affairs that led to a long-running joke about the song in The Simpsons, where the phrase is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2sI0QZjJEs\" title=\"\">Duffman\u2019s catchphrase</a>. This was all clearly a long way from hanging around with the Residents.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a rather strange experience,\u201d Meier says. \u201cIt was the experience of two children who were playing on a beach, sculpting things with sand or whatever they can find, but then, when success kicked in, it was like those two children suddenly being taken into a public space. We signed these contracts with many zeroes after some figures, when no one would have spent a penny to promote Yello at the beginning. We ate the sugar of success, but also the sugar of responsibility. Suddenly, we had these contracts and we were a racehorse, competing at the derby. We lost our childhood as musicians, so to speak.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_ksYVM2cWY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D_ksYVM2cWY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for new single Limbo</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cOnly later, we realised we were artistically running in circles a little bit.

I close my eyes when I listen to music and travel in my mind.\u201d</p> <p>He returns to his computer and his meticulously planned timeline for the forthcoming live shows, which seems to be assuaging his doubts about shaking his ass behind a synthesiser. \u201cI&#xa0;think I can imagine that I will have some fun,\u201d he mutters.</p> <p><em>Toy is out on Universal on 30 September.</em></p>",

Netflix subscribers may already have seen Cage in last year\u2019s Jessica Jones, where Mike Colter delivered a performance of hushed potency as the superpowered PI\u2019s sometimes paramour. Now he\u2019s out on his own, in a show that\u2019s supposedly a sequel but feels more like a prequel, and in which we learn just how he came by his spectacular powers.</p> <p>The first seven episodes suggest a slow burner \u2013 just the kind of story arc that works so well as binge TV, but would never survive on a network. As the show opens, the mysterious Cage is lying low in a New York barbershop, that traditional fulcrum of African American cultural identity, hiding his powers and working menial jobs to pay the rent. But it\u2019s not too long before the new guy in town is forced to face up to the fact that the community he\u2019s living in is rotten to the core, and only he has the abilities to take down the bullies.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytkjQvSk2VA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ytkjQvSk2VA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>And it\u2019s the neighborhood where Cage emerges as the hero of the hour that sets Cheo Hodari Coker\u2019s show apart as a vestibule for hip-hop culture to be introduced into the Marvel universe. Where earlier efforts Daredevil and Jessica Jones were both set in a strangely un-gentrified version of Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Luke Cage is all about Harlem and the area\u2019s powerful resonance as a repository of African American culture and music. Charles Bradley, Faith Evans and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Saadiq\">Raphael Saadiq</a> all perform live at the opulent nightclub owned by villain Cottonmouth (House of Cards\u2019 Mahershala Ali), and the show\u2019s soundtrack is liberally peppered with raw-edged blues, soul and hip-hop motifs, from Wu-Tang Clan to Nina Simone and Mahalia Jackson.</p> <p>It\u2019s a potent stew of cultural reference points that means Luke Cage ends up being fiercely watchable even for those who would not usually take in a superhero show. There are strong supporting turns from Frankie Faison as barbershop owner Pop, Simone Missick as local detective Missy Knight (who loses her bionic arm from the comics but gains a sort-of crime scene superpower) and Alfre Woodard as a shady politician who\u2019s secretly being funded by the bad guys.</p> <p>In places, the show is as uncompromisingly savage in its depiction of criminal underworlds and localised political corruption as Boardwalk Empire and The Wire. But there\u2019s also a strong sense of the hip-hop western, with Harlem as the wild west town and Cage as a Shane-like reluctant hero slowly facing up to his responsibilities. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Coker (best known for writing middling Biggie Smalls biopic Notorious and producing brilliant LA neo-noir Ray Donovan) has described Cage\u2019s wearing of a hoodie as a tribute to Trayvon Martin and the Black Lives Matter movement, there are even occasional nods to civil rights-themed cinema as our hero battles with the disadvantages of being a poor black man in New York.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2016/sep/06/fall-tv-2016-guide-atlanta-designated-survivor-westworld-divorce\">The definitive guide to fall TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The show only seems to run into trouble when it remembers it is supposed to be just one story in a wider Marvel arc \u2013 Cage is due to team up with Daredevil, Jones and the still-to-debut Iron Fist as \u201cstreet-level\u201d Marvel superhero ensemble The Defenders next year \u2013 rather than its own eccentrically soulful animal. In particular, there\u2019s a weirdly clunky moment when an old favourite from previous Netflix episodes suddenly pops up in Harlem just in time to spin the plot in a convenient direction. The Marvel Cinematic Universe came up with the mid-credits scene precisely to avoid having to squeeze such saga-building glue all over the main plot, and those coming to Luke Cage cold might be forgiven the odd double-take at the liberties taken with the movies\u2019 small screen cousin.</p> <p>And yet by the time it begins to veer just slightly off course, the show\u2019s excellent first few episodes (directed with characteristic verve by Sherlock\u2019s Paul McGuigan) have already built up such a repository of trust that our hero could suddenly run into Spider-Man, or develop powers of invisibility, without causing us to blink. And this is, after all a comic book show. </p> <p>Even those who rather miss the old Cage, tiara and all, will find something for them, in the form of a not-so-subtle \u201cEaster egg\u201d moment that will both serve to remind long-term fans of the superhero\u2019s hokey past glories, and have the rest of us belly-laughing at the audacity of the reference. And yes, at one point (just once, mind) I can confirm he even utters that old immortal line: \u201cSweet Christmas!\u201d</p>",
  "<p>According to its editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nikesh-shukla\">Nikesh Shukla</a>, <em>The Good Immigrant</em> is \u201ca document of what it means to be a person of colour\u201d in Britain today. In 21 essays by black, Asian and minority ethnic writers working across literature and the media, the book highlights the standards by which immigrants \u2013 first or second generation, refugees and asylum seekers \u2013 are either accepted into, or judged to be apart from, a dominant culture determined by whiteness.</p> <p>It\u2019s a kind of unspoken deal at the heart of multiculturalism that immigrants are perceived to be \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. A black or Asian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2016/aug/22/ben-jennings-on-britains-olympic-success-cartoon\">Olympic gold medallist</a> or the winner of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/14/bake-off-winner-nadiya-hussain-racist-abuse-is-part-of-her-everyday-life\">reality TV programme</a> is considered a \u201cgood\u201d immigrant by a host nation wanting sporting success or culinary entertainment. \u201cBad\u201d immigrants are \u201cjob-stealers\u201d or \u201cbenefit-scroungers\u201d or, worse, potential terrorists. Sparked by a disgruntled comment below an interview in the Guardian, Shukla\u2019s crowdfunded editorial project emerged from the \u201cconstant anxiety we feel as people of colour to justify our space, to show that we have earned our place at the table\u201d. Against the unspoken backdrop of post-EU referendum hostility towards \u201cforeigners\u201d, Shukla points to \u201cthe backwards attitude to immigration and refugees, the systemic racism that runs through this country to this day\u201d.</p> <p>The essays interrogate a British national culture trapped in a post-imperial state of nostalgia. There is a strong sense throughout that a white universal experience is a fiction against which black and Asian writers must racialise themselves for a reading audience. Several essays speak to the myths of the Asian \u201cmodel minority\u201d or a \u201cmonolithic blackness\u201d. For Wei Ming Kam, \u201cbeing a model minority is code for being on perpetual probation\u201d as well as denying an individual\u2019s complexity. According to Reni Eddo-Lodge: \u201cIt is up to you to make your own version of blackness in any way you can \u2013 trying on all the different versions, altering them until they fit.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gal-dem.com/author/varaidzo/\">Varaidzo</a>, editor at the online magazine gal-dem, writes: \u201cThere is no one way to be black. Our worst performance is entertaining the idea that there is.\u201d As well as anatomising subtle and not-so-subtle forms of racism,<em> The Good Immigrant</em> engages at various points with the identity politics of language, authenticity and cultural appropriation: even \u2013 controversially no doubt \u2013 white practitioners of yoga repeating \u201com\u201d and \u201cnamaste\u201d while understanding little of their meanings.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chimenesuleyman.com/\">Chimene Suleyman</a> movingly traces the origins of names \u2013 her own, her family\u2019s \u2013 across linguistic and political borders from Cyprus to the UK. \u201cWords, names, and their noises are careless in England. They are not put to use in the way that obstructed communities have learned to pronounce every violence put upon us as though it is sacred. We carry our trauma in every word that we say.\u201d As Suleyman rightly suggests, \u201cstandardisation is the backbone of empire\u201d.</p> <p>The legacy of imperialism, including its racial hierarchies, is deep; with the current approval rating of the British empire at 43%, this seems unlikely to change. Suleyman identifies British cultural deafness to historical violence: \u201cIt is there in the white men and women who do not understand, to the point of frustration, why we still walk with the noose of our ancestors around our necks, as we cannot comprehend how they do not carry the indignity of their ancestors tying it there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/15/riz-ahmed-typecast-as-a-terrorist\">Typecast as a terrorist | Riz Ahmed | The Long Read</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Along with Suleyman\u2019s essay, Riz Ahmed\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/15/riz-ahmed-typecast-as-a-terrorist\">\u201cAirports and Auditions\u201d</a> is a standout piece. Ahmed, an increasingly well-known actor, is twice subjected to extensive visa scrutiny when travelling between the UK and the US and is repeatedly searched and detained by officials on both sides of the Atlantic, largely due to assumptions about his race and religion. \u201cYou see,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe pitfalls of the audition room and the airport interrogation room are the same. They are places where the threat of rejection is real. They\u2019re also places where you\u2019re reduced to your marketability or threat-level, where the length of your facial hair can be a deal breaker, where you are seen, and hence see yourself, in reductive labels.\u201d</p> <p>We should recognise both the courage that has been shown in producing these essays and the contradictions that necessarily exist across them.

His family has denied those reports. In the course of the protests, one person was on life support in what city authorities said was a \u201ccivilian on civilian shooting\u201d.</p> <p>Trump also addressed the police shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed African American, on Friday in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she choked,\u201d Trump said of the policewoman who allegedly killed Crutcher. \u201cHe was walking, his hands were high, he was walking to the car, he put the hands on the car \u2013 now maybe she choked, something really bad happened.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also reiterated other familiar talking points in his efforts to reach out to black voters. He described the crime in Chicago as \u201cworse than Afghanistan\u201d, a label which the Republican nominee has frequently used for much of what he calls \u201cthe inner city\u201d. He also proclaimed of the inner city that \u201cit\u2019s so unsafe, where you walk down the street and you get shot, or your child gets shot\u201d.

Although Trump seemingly acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States on Friday at a peculiar press event held in a Washington hotel, he <a href=\"http://abc6onyourside.com/news/election/1-on-1-with-donald-trump\">told an interviewer</a> on Wednesday that he only abandoned the birther conspiracy theory because \u201cI wanted to get on with the campaign. A lot of people were asking me questions.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Hannity, who has appeared in a campaign ad for Trump, asked fawning questions of the Republican nominee and repeatedly praised him in the course of the hour-long interview. The Fox News host who has \u201cnever claimed to be a journalist\u201d made matter of fact statements such as \u201cDemocrats still feel entitled to [the African American] vote\u201d and characterizing Clinton campaign advertisements as \u201cdespicable\u201d.</p> <p>Trump did appear with several African American surrogates, including Don King, the legendary boxing promoter was convicted of stomping a man to death in 1966. King, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/21/don-king-donald-trump-cleveland-rally\">used the N-word at</a> one Trump campaign event earlier on Wednesday and compared the Republican nominee to John the Baptist at another, was more restrained with Hannity. The boxing promoter merely called Trump \u201cthe spirit of America\u201d and compared him to Revolutionary War hero <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/14/russia-s-american-crimea-hero.html\">John Paul Jones.</a> Others who appeared on Trump\u2019s behalf were former rival Ben Carson as well as Darrell Scott, a Cleveland pastor and longtime supporter. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s remarks met with skepticism among some in the African American community. Clayborne Carson, director of the Martin Luther King Jr Research and Education Institute at Stanford University, said \u201cthe theme of his remarks seem to be that I know better than African American leaders what\u2019s best for black Americans. And that kind of arrogance just doesn\u2019t play very well.\u201d Carson noted that Trump\u2019s birtherism made him <em>persona non grata </em>in the African American community as well. \u201cI think for many African American that puts you beyond the pale, that Donald Trump came to national attention in American politics as a person who challenged whether the first black president was really an American,\u201d said Carson. Instead, the noted scholar simply thought Trump\u2019s effort to reach out to the African American community was really an attempt \u201cto get white support\u201d and signal \u201cI am not a racist.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Centrelink could face a wave of legal action from Australian jobseekers over what employment groups say is a \u201cgrowing crisis\u201d arising from penalties or abrupt suspensions of welfare payments imposed by private employment companies.</p> <p>The legal action is being canvassed by the Australian Unemployed Workers\u2019 Union and seeks to examine the behaviour of the private companies to which the government has given the task of managing employment programs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/sep/20/sure-unemployment-is-down-but-plenty-of-people-would-like-to-work-more\">Sure, unemployment is down but plenty of people would like to work more | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The potential legal action could challenge Australia\u2019s heavily privatised employment scheme, which relies on companies effectively making decisions on behalf of the welfare provider, Centrelink, about the conduct of participants in the \u201cwork-for-the-dole\u201d scheme.</p> <p>The president of the AUWU, Owen Bennett, said jobseekers were increasingly contacting the union with stories of abrupt suspensions or penalties to their unemployment or disability allowances. He said some of these decisions were made unfairly, without natural justice and without the companies providing a reasonable opportunity to allow those affected to respond.</p> <p>\u201cThis is pushing these people to a point where they\u2019ve really got nothing to turn to, and it pushes them over the edge in many cases,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting people in very vulnerable positions to the point where their health and generally their wellbeing is being placed under threat.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Employment acknowledged that private contractors played a role in assessing the behaviour of income support payment recipients, but said it provided clear requirements and training on how to appropriately monitor them.</p> <p>Leigh Markovic approached the AUWU after her experiences with her employment provider left her willing to give up her Centrelink payments and become homeless, simply to avoid the stress.</p> <p>The 21-year-old was part of an employment scheme run by Max Employment. The company is one of the largest private contractors involved in the administration of jobseeker programs.</p> <p>But she said she found dealing with the company to be difficult, and said some caseworkers had been unsympathetic and had treated her with contempt. She wanted to find a hospitality job but found the work-for-the-dole program to be increasingly stressful.</p> <p>\u201cI would just start crying at every appointment,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how much worse my mental state was when I was dealing with them. I went in with all these high hopes and goals and just left there feeling stupid, like nobody was going to help me.\u201d</p> <p>Markovic suffers from depression and anxiety, and underwent surgery in August. But she had an appointment scheduled with Max Employment three days after the surgery, which she didn\u2019t believe she would be well enough to attend, so contacted the company repeatedly to ask it for another date.</p> <p>The company sent her a text message, seen by Guardian Australia, advising her that the appointment would be pushed back several weeks. But later on the same day she received another text that said her Centrelink payments had been suspended.</p> <p>\u201cHi LEIGH. Pls call us ASAP \u2026 as you have missed an appt and your Centrelink payment has been suspended under the law. MAX Employment,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Markovic said she had not been given an opportunity to respond. Bennett said the decision was part of a broader problem: private companies were being delegated the power to make decisions on Centrelink\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>\u201cIt puts an extraordinary amount of power in the hands of private companies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The suspension was revoked a day later by Max Employment, but Markovic said it caused her considerable distress. She finally lodged a complaint with the Department of Education, which oversees complaints relating to the jobseeker contract. Guardian Australia has contacted the department to determine the outcome of the complaint, but it said it could not respond due to privacy reasons.</p> <p>Max Employment\u2019s chief operating officer, Darren Hooper, acknowledged the text message had been sent in error to Markovic due to a different staff member logging the appointment change, and that there had been no impact on her payment because the suspension was revoked a day later.</p> <p>Hooper said he had apologised to Markovic about the suspension notice. But he said his staff strove to support Markovic and all their clients, and that Max Employment\u2019s \u201cwhole office service is about creating a positive environment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur staff do act professionally. We provide training, education and we have regular audit checking,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that on some occasions there aren\u2019t errors in judgment and mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would say that we could have serviced her better and that there were actions we took we shouldn\u2019t have taken around the appointment.\u201d</p> <p>He also said Max Employment was not contacted by the Department of Employment in relation to Markovic\u2019s complaint.</p> <p>Bennett said while the private companies bore some responsibility, it was ultimately the government that should be overseeing employment schemes more effectively, and that it was \u201cthe role of government\u201d to ensure the job scheme was working appropriately.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\"></strong></p> <p>\u201cAll they [the companies] do is just press a button and 10% of their unemployment entitlement can be taken away, and it will take them three months to get it back.\u201d</p> <p>For a person to successfully appeal a decision to cancel their Centrelink payments they must challenge the decision in the administrative appeals tribunal, which can take months. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Legal advice provided to the AUWU said there may be a number of types of \u201cpotential unlawfulness\u201d that the government is engaged in, and recommended that they begin to collect documentation from affected jobseekers.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>When asked about the AUWU\u2019s potential action, a spokesman for the Department of Employment said: \u201cThe Department of Human Services has responsibility and delegation to investigate and determine if compliance failures have occurred under social security law.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Department of Employment contracts employment services providers to deliver the jobactive programme.
