  "<p>When we speak of Australian music sharing qualities with the continent\u2019s landscape, usually we\u2019re talking about roads. Rarely do the likes of the Triffids or Icehouse or Ganggajang resemble the rugged grandeur of the nation\u2019s interior: it\u2019s always the endless tarmac, chiselling through landscapes few settlers will ever attain familiarity with. </p> <p>These groups sound dreamy \u2013 cinematic \u2013 because they recall the tranquility of long-distance travel, the calm of witnessing a strange world unfold without the need to step into it.</p> <p>Shining Bird belongs to this tradition. The Austinmer group\u2019s<a href=\"http://fasterlouder.junkee.com/shining-bird-leisure-coast/849551\"> 2013 album Leisure Coast</a> displayed some fledgling ethereal leanings, but now the seven piece is more prepared to flaunt them. Black Opal mostly abandons the folksy demeanour of breakthrough 2012 EP Shades of the Sea, trading in its place the sort of textured, contemplative rock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/08/australian-anthems-icehouse-great-southern-land\">Icehouse perfected with Great Southern Land</a>. Like that song, this album bears the dreamy countenance of a leisure driver, and also like that song, it doesn\u2019t sound Australian so much as it sounds like a mysterious, postcard version of it.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to be moved by the FM nostalgia of Morning Light, which channels the Church\u2019s best work, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbgzB1WKFGQ\">I Can Run</a> recalls a period of Australian rock music when the tiring masculinity of the form was starting to (temporarily) smooth away in favour of something more serene and psychedelic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/06/music-you-missed-10-australian-underground-releases-dispossessed-deep-heat\">Music you missed: 10 Australian underground releases from Deep Heat to Dispossessed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The album isn\u2019t a rote practice in style, though: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPplki-l_SY\">Rivermouth</a> inherits traces of dappled beachside folk from the group\u2019s earlier work, and Love Shadow sounds like It\u2019s My Life-era Talk Talk, accompanied by a fed up drummer. The spectre of the 1980s looms heavily, though there are exceptions like Buried, where bright vocal harmonies join a playful mix of live and electronic instrumentation.</p> <p>Shining Bird doesn\u2019t sound limited by its influences, but Dane Taylor\u2019s lyrics sometimes struggle to live up to the ensemble\u2019s elegance. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkmlUEdrPg\">Helluva Lot </a>shares another trait with Icehouse\u2019s Great Southern Land: under its celebratory, vaguely patriotic surface lies a critical note, listing the Great Dividing Range and the Murray River as examples of treasures we\u2019ll lose in an inevitable (but not explicitly referenced) climate disaster. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhkmlUEdrPg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XhkmlUEdrPg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Usually comfortable with universal yearning, this is Shining Bird\u2019s only brush with topicality \u2013 an absence which feels odd for a group commonly celebrated for its \u201cAustralianness\u201d and known to reference the likes of Murray Ball\u2019s Footrot Flats and Henry Lawson.</p> <p>Shining Bird trades instead in textures, surfaces, sweeping and ruminative mood pieces for directionless interstate travel, and the group is very good at them. Their approach is borne of a fondness for these once outmoded synth-laden excursions, and they lack the irony or auto-critique which seems to drive other groups \u2013 like Client Liaison, for instance \u2013 to revisit forms from this era.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/08/australian-anthems-icehouse-great-southern-land\">Australian anthems: Icehouse \u2013\u00a0Great Southern Land</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s nice to hear a band elicit this sentimental quality without resorting to heavy-handed tactics, or without framing their practice as conceptual revision \u2013 but it also removes any currency or urgency from Shining Bird\u2019s music. The notion of their sound being intrinsically Australian is one worth questioning in 2016 in a nation that no longer has a claim to the quaint, freewheeling self-image of the 1980s, if indeed it ever did. </p> <p>If they interrogated their affection for Australiana more critically than they do here, or allowed more traces of the nation\u2019s contemporary life through their filters, Shining Bird could one day be great. For now, Black Opal sounds like a listless, meditative journey; often haunting and evocative, sometimes even beautiful \u2013 a view of Australia through tinted windows.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Black Opal is out 7 October through Spunk</em></p>",

Her film argues that America\u2019s incarceration of black men is a phenomenon with its roots in slavery, and that the resemblances are not minor or ironic echoes but symptoms of the same structural cause. Ironically, it is about the 13th constitutional amendment, which abolished slavery and the state\u2019s right to deprive a person of liberty but with the specific exception of \u201ccriminals\u201d, thus forging a link in the judicial mindset between imprisonment and slavery. It is an attitude that persists into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/22/mississippi-anti-lgbt-law-derrick-errick-simmons-greenville\" title=\"\">Jim Crow era</a>, the Nixon/Reagan wars on crime and drugs, the Clinton three-strikes rule \u2026 and beyond.

The figures showed little improvement in diverse casting over the past decade, even in years in which more films were released. <br></p> <p>Heather Stewart, the BFI\u2019s creative director, said the figures were important in providing a benchmark \u201cfrom which we can start to see whether anybody is making any progress at all, and what makes the biggest difference.\u201d<br></p> <p>She said: \u201cThere is still very little colourblind casting. You get a role because it\u2019s Nelson Mandela or Martin Luther King, or you get the usual genres where it\u2019s crime, prison, hip-hop \u2013 where you expect to have black people.

In 2001 the Truckers laid their claim for immortality with <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/southern-rock-opera-mw0000660406\">Southern Rock Opera</a>, a double album that pronounced southern identity as more complex than Confederate flags and racial scorn. Instead, Hood reimagines the southern experience through the eyes of a kid from Alabama who uses music as a conduit to greater things. As the title suggests, the songs are epic, the guitars are plentiful, and the references proudly regional. The album was widely praised, not just for its literate storytelling, but also for how it reclaimed southern rock from the state fair circuit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/05/southern-rock-passion-marred-racism\">Lynyrd Skynyrd cover bands</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople kept telling us what a terrible idea it was and it would be the end to our promising young career, but it felt right to us. We had a vision it was going to be and we followed it,\u201d he says. \u201cTurned out it worked.\u201d</p> <p>Hood, too, is a child of Alabama. He grew up outside of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/21/muscle-shoals-alabama-documentary\">Muscle Shoals</a>, home to the famed recording studio where his father, David Hood, served as a member the <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-muscle-shoals-rhythm-section-mn0001352027/biography\">Muscle Shoals rhythm section</a>, playing bass on hundreds of recordings by Aretha Franklin, the Staple Singers, Etta James, Bobby Womack and Wilson Pickett. At an early age the younger Hood broke from the sports culture of north Alabama and turned to writing for refuge. It ignited a passion for politics. In the third grade he turned in a paper about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/watergate\">Watergate</a> that suggested that President Nixon \u201cshould be tarred and feathered and tried for treason\u201d. The teacher sent him home. </p> <p>\u201cTo me, the political is personal. Because it\u2019s not a sporting event where, at the end of the day, the team clocks out and moves on. There are very real things that that happen,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Yet this album almost didn\u2019t. By late 2015 the band planned to take this year off after an extended touring regimen following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/27/drive-by-truckers-english-oceans-review\">English Oceans</a>, their record from the previous year. Hood had relocated his family to Portland while Mike Cooley, his main collaborator, remained in Georgia aiming to write his first solo record. Soon enough the headlines laid both plans to rest: police overreach, street protests, the mainstreaming of the far right. \u201cSongs started coming for both of us,\u201d he said. Over three days in November the band cut nine of them; another three days in January finished the job. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY0qOCUy27Q\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mY0qOCUy27Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of the revelations of American Band is how this isn\u2019t a record that can be easily plastered on a protest sign or blasted at a rally. The songs go deeper in that they tell stories with human faces and personal testimony. For that reason no other band than this one can claim the mantle to the golden years of Bruce Springsteen. On Ever South, Hood traces his people\u2019s journey from Ellis Island to Appalachia where, once tormented as outsiders, they became the tormentors under the revival tent of Christian fervor. </p> <p>Another song connects the dots back to the fallout from 9/11 when in 2001 <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/usa/358957-911-clear-channel-memo/\">Clear Channel Communications, now iHeartMedia, released a list of 165 songs, including John Lennon\u2019s Imagine, for a suggested airplay ban</a> because they were \u201clyrically questionable\u201d in contradicting the thirst for war. On Once They Banned Imagine, Cooley sings of the same frenzy continuing today: \u201cWith or against, something been out to get us / and it looked like something finally did.\u201d </p> <p>For a band known for long shows and double albums \u2013 a consequence of there being three songwriters in the lineup \u2013 American Band is surprisingly lean and concise, with the 11 songs clocking in at about 45 minutes together. That was intentional, Hood says, to cater to the attention spans of those people who need to hear it the most. With so much talk in the media about southern white males clinging to the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, there is a silent caucus representing those, like Hood, who are white middle-aged men in the south who consider him anathema to the republic.</p> <p>\u201cThat is a big reason why this record exists. I am as truly in his demographic as you can get and I don\u2019t want anyone for a second to think that SOB speaks for me,\u201d he says. \u201cAlabama is a red state, but there are people who feel otherwise there. There\u2019s no shortage of people who feel that way, but they\u2019re not the ones being heard because they are not as loud. There needs to be more middle-aged southern dudes saying that black lives matter.\u201d</p> <p>American Band is also a statement on the state of the Truckers, which, besides Cooley and Hood, include bassist Matt Patton, multi-instrumentalist Jay Gonzalez and drummer Brad Morgan. This is the band\u2019s 20th year and the record is evidence that the urgency the band sparked in its first half thrives today. Much of that has to do with Hood\u2019s 31-year relationship with Cooley that, contentious at times, stands on its contradictory strengths, not just in songwriting but also in musical flourishes, like how Cooley\u2019s guitar spikes Hood\u2019s quieter songs with gnarly guitar licks, and the same in reverse.</p> <p>The band will tour on the record through late February and then another month in Europe before returning again come summer. By then the US will have a new president, which will make the record more relevant, no matter the outcome. \u201cOur families got back behind this record now, which is wonderful,\u201d Hood says. \u201cThat tells us we\u2019re doing something we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d</p>",

It was a landmark film even for having a black lead, but its bleak climax made a depressing statement on American sociopolitical progress. There are moments throughout the film that imply hostility towards Ben\u2019s race and his power but issues surrounding his racial identity aren\u2019t overtly explored. </p> <p></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/24/creed-boxing-film-stars-black-hero-michael-b-jordan-rocky-spinoff\">Creed: why do so few boxing films have black heroes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the key dynamics in Get Out is the interracial relationship between the two leads and appears to be a catalyst for the nefarious doings later in the story. \u201cDo they know I\u2019m black?\u201d is a line Chris delivers with concern and also dread, imagining the possible scenarios he\u2019ll encounter upon meeting Rose\u2019s parents. His self-awareness of how his race might present a challenge suggests an honesty and subjective insight we\u2019re not often shown within the genre. This is something we didn\u2019t quite get in 1992\u2019s Candyman.</p> <p>That story goes back to the 1890s when Daniel Robatille, a black, wealthy socialite is commissioned to paint a portrait of a white landowner\u2019s daughter. But when the two fall in love and their relationship is discovered by her father and his peers, Daniel is lynched and his tortured soul is doomed to wreak havoc on anyone saying the name Candyman five times in a mirror. The film delivers a powerful commentary of the brutal manifestation of racism and its lingering effect on a community, but it focuses its sympathetic eye on a contemporary white female protagonist, played by Virginia Madsen. Her personal and professional turning points became focal and the film leaves little to no room for investigating the horrors of racism from the point of view of the black characters. Candyman is not the center, she is.</p> <p>The shift in focus shown in the trailer for Get Out and the exploration of racial identity suggests that the horror genre might finally be ready to push a new boundary. There\u2019s so much to unpack in the 150-second preview, giving us a mere glimpse of themes we\u2019re not used to seeing in horror. The timing of the film also mirrors Romero\u2019s efforts in the 60s to reflect America\u2019s struggle with race, a nation still plagued by ongoing, institutional injustice. While Get Out will act as entertainment predominantly (it\u2019s from Blumhouse, the production company behind Insidious and The Purge), with daily reports of black men killed for the color of their skin, it\u2019s also a vital reminder that racism remains a more terrifying force than any supernatural boogeyman.</p> <p></p>"
