  "<h2>The Post-grad Gapper<br>'After my masters, time for something really different'</h2> <p><strong>Mushtaq Patas, student, 22, from Leicester</strong></p> <p><strong>The brief:</strong> 'I'm studying at Nottingham University for an MA which finishes in October, and after working for six months, I'm planning a six-month trip. I really want to go to South America, and am particularly interested in the Galapagos Islands. I would love to spend some time volunteering there. I'd also like to learn Spanish and travel around the region. But I would consider other destinations, such as India and Sri Lanka.'</p> <p><strong>Budget: </strong>At least \u00a34,000</p> <p><strong>The solution:</strong><br><strong> Lonely Planet's Abigail Hole: </strong>'There are lots of volunteer projects available on the Galapagos Islands. Mushtaq could try the Darwin Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.darwinfoundation.org\">darwinfoundation.org</a>), though it requires a minimum commitment of six months (volunteers pay their own transport, living expenses and insurance). Gap-year providers such as <a href=\"http://www.i-to-i.com\">i-to-i.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.gapyearforgrownups.co.uk\">gapyearforgrownups.co.uk</a> offer places on various projects, i-to-i has one- to eight-week conservation projects (from \u00a3385 for the first week, \u00a385 a week thereafter, excluding flights). </p> <p>'He could start in Quito (return airfare \u00a3500-800) and sign up for a language course (doing so on arrival means he can compare schools before committing), often the school can sort out a homestay too. He can then head off to travel around South America. The Gap Year &amp; Round the World branch of Lonely Planet's Thorntree website (<a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree\">lonelyplanet.com/thorntree</a>) is a good source of ideas. </p> <p>'Or he could fly to Delhi from London, exploring India overland before flying from Chennai in the south to Sri Lanka. (Flying London-Delhi, then Chennai-Colombo-London will cost around \u00a3750; if he decides to visit only India, London-Delhi costs from \u00a3400 return.) The Confederation of Voluntary Associations (<a href=\"http://www.covanetwork.org\">covanetwork.org</a>) could match Mushtaq with a programme that requires his skills.' </p> <p><strong> Real Gap's Helen Guyver:</strong> 'Mushtaq could start by learning Spanish at our school in Quito (from \u00a3449 for two weeks, \u00a3999 for four), then choose between our Galapagos Giant Tortoise Volunteer Project (from \u00a3899 for two weeks or \u00a31,199 for up to four weeks - he can combine this with the language school and get a discount), or teach English to children in the Galapagos (from \u00a3849 for two weeks or \u00a31,099 for four weeks). On either project he would be working alongside international volunteers, many of whom would be travelling independently afterwards. Then he could head back to the Ecuador mainland and down through Peru and Bolivia. In Bolivia he could volunteer at the Sucre orphanage (\u00a3799 for two weeks' language school and four weeks' volunteering).' </p> <p><strong> Year Out Group's Richard Oliver:</strong> 'India is a very popular destination for volunteers, Sri Lanka less so, not least because of the security situation. The key to a successful placement is research. Year Out Group's website lists a huge range of volunteering organisations, and has a planning checklist. Mushtaq should also ask to be put in touch with someone who has recently returned from that placement. </p> <p>'Changing Worlds offers childcare, medical, journalism and teaching placements in India from \u00a32,665 for three months, including flights, a two-day course in the UK, three-day familiarisation on arrival and basic food and accommodation. Projects Abroad offers placements in India and Sri Lanka in teaching, care, conservation, journalism, business and veterinary medicine starting at \u00a3845 for a month and \u00a31,395 for three months (slightly more for Sri Lanka). The price includes food and accommodation, transport to and from the airport and insurance. Placements can be extended for \u00a3395/\u00a3495 a month.'</p> <h2>The Big Spenders<br>'Six months to see the world'</h2> <p><strong>Jackie, 60, speech and language therapist, and Warwick Turnball, 61, university social work tutor, from Leeds</strong></p> <p><strong>The brief: </strong>'We're planning a six-month trip from around November 2009. We're both in good health and young in attitude. We'd like to include south-east Asia. New Zealand is also a must, probably touring in a camper van. We would like to include South America, particularly Machu Picchu in Peru and the Galapagos Islands. But we're open to suggestions.'</p> <p><strong>Budget: </strong>\u00a330,000</p> <p><strong>The solution: </strong><br><strong>Lonely Planet's Abigail Hole: </strong>'The first step would be to pick up a round-the-world ticket - try Western Air (<a href=\"http://www.westernair.co.uk\">westernair.co.uk</a>), Round the World Tickets (<a href=\"http://www.roundtheworldtickets.com\">roundtheworldtickets.com</a>) or Round the World Experts (www.roundtheworldexperts.co.uk). A route might be Manchester-Bangkok-Singapore-Sydney-Auckland-Santiago-Lima-Quito-Manchester (around \u00a32,250). They could do the Bangkok-Singapore section overland or arrange a tour from Bangkok to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, with Explore (<a href=\"http://www.explore.co.uk\">explore.co.uk</a>). Then they could fly to Singapore, and train, bus or boat it to Malaysia (try the Perentian Islands). After touring in New Zealand, they can fly to Santiago in Chile, then fly or travel overland to Lima and Machu Picchu, then Ecuador for a cruise around the Galapagos Islands (try <a href=\"http://www.happygringo.com\">happygringo.com</a>).'</p> <p><strong>Real Holiday's Philip Davies: </strong>'The oneworld airline alliance, which includes BA and nine other carriers, offeres a 'Global Explorer' multi-stop ticket at just over \u00a32,000, allowing up to 10 stopovers. I would suggest they start in South America, hitting New Zealand for Christmas and south-east Asia in the spring when the weather's perfect. They could start in Quito, Ecuador, with Imaginative Traveller's (<a href=\"http://www.imaginative-traveller.com\">imaginative-traveller.com</a>) 23-day 'Galapagos and Inca Explorer' trip (it includes Machu Picchu). We could tailor a 14-day trip in Chile taking in the Atacama Desert, the lakes and Santiago. Next they could fly to Auckland, stopping off on Easter Island and Bora Bora in French Polynesia. In New Zealand we could tailor-make a trip, but a camper van gives flexibility. They could drop the van in Christchurch and fly to Thailand via Sydney. That would leave \u00a39,000 for an independent adventure around Indochina.'</p> <p><strong>Trailfinders' Andrew Appleby: </strong>'To make the most of each region, they should book open-jaw flights and travel overland between the main cities. We'd recommend flying into Bangkok, out of Singapore, into Auckland, out of Christchurch and into Santiago and out of Lima. A British Airways &amp; Qantas World Discovery ticket for the basic route costs from \u00a31,549; we can add other flights. Trailfinders offers a range of tours such as a seven-day independent Peruvian tour with GAP Adventures covering Cuzco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu, from \u00a3755 per person. Or we can tailor-make an itinerary - with their budget, the sky is the limit. If they tour New Zealand in a camper van, they should be sure to take in the dramatic scenery around Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu on South Island. Vans cost from \u00a340 a day.'</p> <h2>A Solo Trip<br>'Getting under the skin of a place'</h2> <p><strong>Susan Thompson, 59, NHS business manager, from Chester</strong></p> <p><strong>The brief: </strong> 'I'm looking to set myself a new challenge. I'm planning a solo trip next year of between three and six months and am flexible about where to go, although my first call will be Japan as I have family there. I'd prefer to travel slowly in a couple of countries and really get to know them and the culture. I want to do some voluntary work and I'd like the money I spend to benefit local people.'</p> <p><strong>Budget: </strong>\u00a36,000</p> <p><strong>The solution: </strong><br><strong> Lonely Planet's Abigail Hole: </strong>'Susan should buy a flight to Japan via Bangkok (\u00a3800). On the return leg, she can explore south-east Asia, perhaps heading for Malaysia or Vietnam to volunteer, as these are particularly unthreatening countries. A good place to start research into voluntary work is <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/volunteer\">lonelyplanet.com/volunteer</a>, which advises on how to best benefit local people. I-to-i (<a href=\"http://www.i-to-i.com\">i-to-i.com</a>) offers possibilities such as building homes in Vietnam (\u00a3595-1,595/two-12 weeks). For other building projects try Habitat for Humanity (<a href=\"http://www.habitatforhumanity.org.uk\">habitatforhumanity.org.uk</a>), which runs building projects (\u00a31,876/two weeks in Cambodia). Or in Pokhara, Nepal, she could help at the Rainbow Orphanage (<a href=\"http://www.orphancarenepal.org/volunteer.php\">orphancarenepal.org/volunteer.php</a> - \u00a3350/two months). </p> <p><strong> Real Holidays' Philip Davies: </strong>'Susan could book a return flight with Sri Lankan Airlines from London to Tokyo via Colombo. If she departs in late September and stays for a month she will enjoy the autumn colours, and have time to see her family and travel. She can then use the Tokyo-Colombo leg of her ticket to connect to Cochin in southern India and join a 29-day North and South India Trip with Intrepid Travel (<a href=\"http://www.intrepidtravel.com\">intrepidtravel.com</a>). Susan could jump ship at the end of the southern section at Masinagudi, close to the Jungle Retreat in the Nigiri Hills for wildlife experiences - where dormitory accommodation costs less than \u00a310 a day. Then she could fly from Bangalore to Delhi to pick up the northern half of Intrepid's trip, with its Moghul and Rajput highlights. It ends in Delhi so she could fly south to Colombo in January and start six weeks of volunteer work organised by i-to-i (details as before). With international flights at \u00a3810, internal flights at \u00a3400, Intrepid's tour at \u00a3890, a week at the Jungle Retreat from \u00a350 and a six-week children's home volunteering placement coming in at \u00a3695, Susan will still have half her budget left for travelling in Japan.'</p> <p><strong> Gap Year for Grown Ups' Helen Guyver:</strong> 'She could fly from London to Tokyo, then to Auckland, on to Adelaide, overland to Perth, then back via Bangkok and Delhi for around \u00a32,200. After two weeks in Japan she could join our 'Grand Island Explorer', a 21-day adventure tour of New Zealand which costs \u00a31,499, followed by the 'Ultimate Road Journey' in Australia, taking nine days to explore the southern coast, with bush walking, swimming with dolphins and camel trekking. She could then spend four weeks doing community development work in Thailand, teaching English, with a week on a beach too, for \u00a3999, and possibly finish off with four weeks' volunteering in India at the Kanjar Community Development in Rajasthan for \u00a3649. If this is too much she could just choose parts of it and stay longer.'</p> <h2>The Green Travellers<br>'We don't want to fly'</h2> <p><strong>Lise Hovesen, 22, and Temujin Doran, 24, art students, from Falmouth, Cornwall </strong></p> <p><strong>The Brief: </strong><br>'We're planning a round-the-world trip by land and sea \u2013 we don't want to fly \u2013 starting in October . We need to start in Berlin and would then like to travel<br>to St Petersburg and on to Moscow for the Trans-Mongolian train to Beijing. We'd like to spend some time in China and about a month in Asia, possibly getting a ferry to Japan. We have heard that some people will take you on as crew on boats \u2013 is this 'sea hitch-hiking' viable? We like the idea of a cargo ship across the Pacific from Hong Kong to Canada and would like to spend<br>time in Canada and America, possibly looking for work to top up our budget. '</p> <p><strong>Budget:</strong> \u00a36,000-plus between us</p> <p><strong>The solution: </strong><br><strong>Ed Gillespie: </strong>'For the Trans-Siberian and Mongolian railways they need to book well in advance through a Russian agent (G&amp;R International via <a href=\"http://www.hostels.ru/en\">hostels.ru/en</a>); both get very busy. Ferries to Japan from China go from Tianjin or Shanghai to Kobe and Osaka, take around 48 hours and are good value (try shanghai-ferry. co.jp ). They can get a cargo ship from Japan to Canada (<a href=\"http://www.freightertravel.co.nz\">freightertravel.co.nz</a>) but freighters cost \u00a360-80 a day. For security reasons cargo ship \"hitchhiking\" is not possible these days, but they may<br>be able to ride free on a yacht (<a href=\"http://www.crewseekers.net\">crewseekers.net</a>) . They should not tie<br>themselves to an itinerary - half the fun lies in plans changing!'</p> <p><strong>Lonely Planet's Abigail Hole:</strong> 'They could look for work teaching English in China or Hong Kong (<a href=\"http://www.overseasjobcentre.co.uk\">overseasjobcentre.co.uk</a>). Some freighter ships accept paying passengers (http://studenttravel.about.com/od/boardaboat/a/boattravel.htm) but they're no bargain when a Tokyo-California voyage lasts 13 days. Work permits for Canada or America are tricky; they could try Australia instead, applying for a<br>working holiday visa (<a href=\"http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday\">immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday</a>) before they go.'</p> <p><strong>Rough Guide's Doug Lansky:</strong> 'After the trans-Mongolian to Beijing, they should head to Shanghai or Hong Kong to catch a freighter to Australia (<a href=\"http://www.strandtravel.co.uk\">strandtravel.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freighterworld.com\">freighterworld.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freighter-cruises.com\">freighter-cruises.com</a>), or continue to Singapore and pick up a boat there. From Adelaide they can take a container ship to Auckland (six days) and try to hitch a ride on a yacht to Tonga, Fiji, Hawaii or the US from Auckland, Opua or Whangarei. Or they could stay in Australia and look for a ride from Townsville, Airlie Beach or the Whitsundays. In the US, take Greyhound buses (<a href=\"http://www.greyhound.com\">greyhound.com</a>), Amtrak trains (<a href=\"http://www.amtrak.com\">amtrak.com</a>) or do a driveaway (driving someone else's car ) to cross the country.

I am hoping to climb three of the Seven Summits (the highest mountains on each of the seven continents) \u2013 Mount<br>Elbrus in Europe (5,642m) , Kilimanjaro in Africa (5,895m ) and Aconcagua in South America (6,962m ). I have some climbing/mountaineering experience, but training is something to consider. I'll be travelling alone, but will most likely join a guided group.'</p> <p><strong>Budget: </strong>Around \u00a35,000 (excluding equipment)</p> <p><strong>The solution: </strong><br><strong>KE Adventure Travel's Pete Royall:</strong> 'None of these three summits is technically difficult but all require good fitness and stamina, mainly to deal with the effects of high altitude. Of the three, Elbrus is the only one where Sam will definitely need crampons, ice axe and basic mountaineering skills. He could perhaps enrol on a winter skills course before attempting this peak. The budget is not really enough for all three peaks as they are on different continents; I would suggest he concentrate on the highest two and enjoy travelling in Africa and South America . He will have the best chance of success if he joins an organised expedition. This will ensure a good acclimatisation programme and he'll share the adventure with like-minded people. KE Adventure Travel offers a nine-day ascent of Kilimanjaro for \u00a3795 excluding flights, and park fees will add another \u00a3370. KE's 22-day Aconcagua ascent costs \u00a31,995 excluding flights, and climbing permits are \u00a3165 in December or January, or \u00a3115 in February. With careful selection of routes and airlines Sam should be able to keep total flight costs under \u00a31,500. The best season to climb Aconcagua is December to February. Kilimanjaro can be climbed pretty much all year round, though it would be sensible to avoid the two wet periods of April/May and November.'</p> <p><strong>Climber magazine's Kate Burke:</strong> 'The obvious route for Sam is to join a guided group. Companies such as Jagged Globe run trips to the Seven Summits, providing not only a guide, but also porters, food, permits and even equipment . The full cost of a trip to one of these peaks with a UK organisation could be in the region of \u00a32,000 . See <a href=\"http://www.climber.co.uk/marketplace\">climber.co.uk/marketplace</a> for a list of companies offering expeditions. Finding a guide or group in the nearest town (eg. Moshi for Kilimanjaro) may be cheaper, but he won't know the credentials of the guide. Kilimanjaro does not require technical ability, but a high level of fitness is essential. Aconcagua is much more challenging: as well as fitness and mental strength, experience with crampon and ice axe is useful, as is experience of moving together roped up. It may be worth going on a winter mountain skills course beforehand. Plas y Brenin in Snowdonia and Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore offer a range of courses. Sam may struggle to find an expedition to Elbrus, as the Foreign Office currently advises against travel to this area [the Caucasus], due to political problems.</p>",
  "<p>'The Russians are invading Georgia,' said Kate, as she left our office on Friday evening. 'Enjoy your weekend.' Running a company like Wild Frontiers, with trips operating in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan, I have become used to high-voltage tourism. But a full-on tank invasion by a world superpower? It doesn't get more shocking than that. </p> <p>On seeing the BBC website, I relaxed a little. 'Russian tanks enter South Ossetia' ran the headline. To be honest, I wasn't surprised. Under President Mikheil Saakashvili, Russia-baiting had become something of a national pastime and the news that Vladimir Putin had finally lost patience and moved into one of Georgia's breakaway republics was not unexpected. My worry was for our tour group, who were finishing a walking trip in the Svaneti region, sandwiched uncomfortably between the conflict zone and Abkhazia, Georgia's second restless state. </p> <p>I called Amanda, our guide, who was staying in Mestia, close to the Russian border. Miraculously I got through. 'All fine here,' she said. 'Everyone happy. We've heard there are some troubles but I don't see it affecting us too much ... just Gori tomorrow might be a problem.' You could say that.</p> <p>At 6am on Saturday we had an emergency call from Khatuna, who works for our partner tour operator in Tbilisi. She sounded stressed. 'We've got a problem. The Russians are bombing Gori.' </p> <p>Amanda's group was due to pass through Gori, Stalin's birthplace and also a pleasant little town with a fascinating museum that most of our groups visit. Now, for the first time, it occurred to me that the group could be in real danger. Adventure travel is one thing, but air raids, tanks and invading special forces are quite another. </p> <p>Amanda said the group was on its way to Zugdidi, and from there to Kutaisi. I told her not to go further than Kutaisi and that I would call her back once I had more information. I checked the BBC again, but couldn't believe my eyes - Gori was in flames. I have been to Georgia about six times and know it pretty well - with its fascinating history, wonderful mountains and ever-fun inhabitants, it's one of my favourite destinations. In fact I had only just returned from leading a horse riding holiday there. </p> <p>I called Khatuna back. 'If Gori is under attack, doesn't that block the main road back to Tbilisi?' 'Yes and the airport is closed,' she said. 'We must see if we can re-route the group to Armenia.' </p> <p>I agreed and asked her to contact Amanda and tell her to stay overnight in Kutaisi. Meanwhile, I tried to change their flights. Flight reference numbers had to be found and airlines called, next of kin details sourced and relatives reassured, insurance companies brought up to speed and reports made - a long and arduous process, made no easier by the relevant airline being out of its depth with the situation. But by mid-afternoon, we had managed to secure new flights from Yerevan, the capital of neighbouring Armenia, on the Monday.</p> <p>The headlines now read: 'Russian troops enter second breakaway republic of Abkhazia and head towards Georgian border - invasion looking imminent.' With panic now enveloping Georgia, it was impossible for me to get through to Amanda. Bloody hell, I thought. Zugdidi is less than 12 miles from the southern border of Abkhazia. Should the Russians invade, Amanda's group would be right in their path. But she called a little later. 'All fine here,' Amanda said calmly. 'We are at a hotel in Kutaisi. We'll head on to the Armenian border tomorrow.'</p> <p>I warned her to avoid Gori and to take the mountain road instead, and told her she had a hotel waiting in Yerevan. I asked how the group was faring. </p> <p>'All fine. No problems at all,' she said, but they had no idea that the Russian army was almost upon them. I heard nothing more from Amanda for the rest of that day or through a fairly nervous Sunday morning. The only news I had was from the internet, which reported that Kutaisi had been bombed and that the region was now awash with Russian troops. As I sat at my desk waiting nervously for news of the group, it occurred to me that we had been lucky - had the trip been scheduled a week later, the group would now be behind the front line. </p> <p>Finally, at around 3pm on Sunday, I had a text from Amanda to say they had made it to the border; and then another to say they were enjoying a beer at my expense in a five-star hotel in the Armenian capital. Starved of the whole picture, and staying one step ahead of the fighting, her group had not seen any trouble or been worried by the extraordinary events unfolding around them. </p> <p>On Wednesday I had an email from one of the group, Ross Bishop from Preston, saying: 'I enjoyed a wonderful holiday, surrounded by stunning, unspoilt scenery and hosted by the warm, hospitable local people.' From London, it had been a very different story.</p>",
  "<p>Last August, the BBC reported that 'China's growing love of dairy products is threatening to push UK prices up'. Like many people who have travelled to China, I was startled: isn't lactose intolerance the norm among the Han Chinese, who form 92 per cent of China's population? Though you could sip an American ice-cream soda in Hong Kong, I never saw any dairy produce at all during my trips to mainland China in the 1980s, with the single exception of 'fried milk' in a restaurant in Guangzhou. </p> <p>We now hear there are milk bars in Beijing, while the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says China's consumption of milk has gone from 26 kilocalories per person per day in 2002 to 43 in 2005. Is it coincidental that in 2006 Chinese children were reported to be an average 6cm taller than they were 30 years ago? The answer, of course, is that this is the result of increased calorie consumption from all food sources, just what you'd expect in a booming economy. </p> <p>Milk aside, there's no doubt that visitors to the Olympics will experience very different food to what was on offer until comparitively recently. The most notable change is the existence of restaurants serving non-Chinese cuisines. If you go to Shanghai, as did chef Kylie Kwong for <strong>My China Cookbook: Stories and Recipes From my Homeland </strong>(Collins \u00a330), you can eat world-class cosmopolitan food in her friend Michelle Garnaut's M on the Bund. Elsewhere, Kwong, a fourth-generation Chinese-Australian, engagingly admits to having eaten some terrible MSG-laden meals and justifiably rails that the 'inevitable pollution ... affects every part of the food chain'. There's a breathless, whistlestop aspect to her travels, but Simon Griffiths's photographs are often as moving as Kwong finding her family in Guangdong, and the resulting book is beautifully produced. Many of her recipes call for fillet of beef, brown rice vinegar or brown sugar, but I trust her palate.</p> <p>A good deal more sophisticated, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.o?ISBN=9781579653019\"><strong>Beyond the Great Wall: Recipes and Travels in the Other China </strong></a>(Artisan \u00a330) by Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid, a Canadian couple who travel, write and take terrific photographs, is a collection of recipes from the other 8 per cent of China's population - its 125 million members of China's official 55 non-Han minority peoples, most of whom live outside the Great Wall. Duguid first went to China in 1980, and her recollections, especially of 'Chinese regional food prepared by gifted chefs in banquet style, which meant there were many refined dishes and very little rice', exactly match my own. But despite the good writing and intrinsically interesting subject, you'd be hard pressed to love these recipes.</p> <p>The Olympics, though, are bound to raise our Chinese food awareness. What classic Chinese cookery books might I recommend? The British cherish the Chinese-American Ken Hom (below) even more than his compatriots do. Any of his books will serve, but the one I like best is <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.o?ISBN=9781862057074\"><strong>A Taste of China </strong></a>(1990, Pavilion). The late Yan-Kit So was a deeply scholarly person and you can rely on her recipes. I favour her <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.o?ISBN=9781405316941\"><strong>Classic Chinese Cookbook </strong></a>(1984, Dorling Kindersley)and her <strong>Classic Food of China</strong><strong> </strong>(1992, Macmillan). The undisputed champion currently writing about China is Fuchsia Dunlop; perhaps her Hunanese book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780091904838\"><strong>The Revolutionary Chinese Cookbook </strong></a>(2006, Ebury). A specialised, out-of-the-way book on my favourite meal is <strong>Dim Sum </strong>(1985, Macdonald) by Margaret Leeming and May Huang Man-Hui, with dozens of dumpling recipes.</p>",
  "<p>Things just got even tougher in Texas. The Lone Star state, which prides itself on its macho Western cowboy image, is now to have the first school district in America in which teachers can carry concealed guns.</p> <p>The tiny community of Harrold, in the far north of the state, has recently approved a local decision that allows its teachers to bring firearms to school to protect against possible shootings.</p> <p>So when the school re-opens after the long summer holiday, any of the college's 50 or so staff could bring pistols to their classrooms. The decision is likely to provoke uproar in other parts of America and will shock gun control advocates, who argue that teachers with guns in class actually escalate the chance of a shooting.</p> <p>However, those arguments have cut little ice with the authorities in the Harrold school district. They are worried that a steady stream of shootings in schools and colleges in America will eventually reach their small, isolated region. Although that seems unlikely, school shootings are a real problem in America. Last month, three people were wounded at a shooting in Phoenix, Arizona.</p> <p>Local officials have argued that the single campus in their 110-student district is too far away from the nearest sheriff's office if there were an emergency. They have also said that a nearby main road might increase the chances of a dangerous gunman attacking the school.</p> <p>In a local newspaper interview, David Thweatt, the superintendent of the Harrold Independent School District, defended the decision and said keeping guns out of schools was more dangerous than having them in. </p> <p>'When the federal government started making schools gun-free zones, that's when all of these shootings started. Why would you put it out there that a group of people can't defend themselves? That's like saying \"sic em\" to a dog,' Thweatt told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.</p>",
  "<p>Praise a certain kind of novelist and he will smile in a way that says: 'Well, of course you enjoyed my book; it's by me.' Francis Wyndham is not this kind of novelist. Tell him that you enjoyed his slim novel, or his short stories, and his wide, rectangular face, which can look lugubrious in repose, will split in two in a delight so genuine you could almost warm your hands on it. 'Oh, I'm glad you thought that was funny!' he says, when I tell him that a line of his made me cry with laughter. 'It's so important for writing to be funny. Don't you think that, in life, things are sad and funny almost at the same time?' His hands flutter momentarily in the air, like tiny birds. 'In a kind of way, something doesn't exist until it is read. So I am always pleased if I hear someone did like it.' A pause. 'But then, I can also completely understand if someone doesn't get it.' Another pause. 'Though I don't think anyone's actually going to hate it.'</p> <p>It's not only innate modesty that enables him to talk of his work in so politely halting a way. The unlikely arc of a long writing career has lent him what you might call perspective. Wyndham, who was born in 1924, wrote his first collection of stories, Out of the War, as a teenager but, rejected for publication, he put them away and forgot all about them until 1974, when they finally appeared between hard covers. Another decade passed. In 1985, a second collection appeared, Mrs Henderson. Then, in 1987, he published The Other Garden and, at the somewhat mature age of 63, he won the Whitbread First Novel Prize.</p> <p>He followed this with a collection of his journalism, The Theatre of Embarrassment but, thereafter, silence reigned. The fiction fell slowly out of print. Until now. Next month, Picador will publish it again, in a single volume with an introduction by Wyndham's friend Alan Hollinghurst ('Exceptionally accomplished... a writer who never wastes a word or puts one wrong...'). How does this new - I refuse to say final - twist make Wyndham feel? 'Oh, I am terribly grateful. Things mostly don't get reprinted these days, unless they're famous and important. There could be something melancholy about it, but there isn't. So I'm just very grateful.'</p> <p>Did the writing leave him or did he leave the writing? Neither, really. 'It would be lovely to think that I'd written a lot of books, instead of just these. But I believe that a lot of writers write too much. I don't mean that they shouldn't, but... I had jobs, you see. I had to sort of make a living. I had a few ideas. One or two things. Occasionally, I did try. But I didn't feel that I owed it to myself or to anyone else. When nothing happened, I didn't feel guilty about it.' While he concedes that 'it's rather embarrassing that The Other Garden remains my only novel', he also likes 'sitting still' far too much to do anything about it. A few years ago, his old friend Lucian Freud asked Wyndham to sit for him. 'He suddenly rang me up and said, \"I want to see you.\" He came round at once in his Rolls and took me off to a restaurant. He was nervous. I thought it might be some histoire with David [Sylvester, the art critic, who was also a friend]. But then he said, \"Will you sit for me?\" I said of course. And I loved it. It was terribly interesting. We've plenty to talk about. He's wonderful company and the only way to see Lucian unless you're a beautiful young girl is to be painted by him. But it's also that I like sitting for a painting more than anything. I love sitting still, and that's what you have to do, and by doing it, you're helping this very talented person.'</p> <p>In the gaps between his writing, Wyndham has made something of a career out of helping talented people. Over the years, it has fallen to him to be a first reader of manuscripts by, among others, VS Naipaul, Jean Rhys, Bruce Chatwin and, more recently, Edward St Aubyn. This, a literary career that has so far spanned six decades, and the fact that his maternal grandmother was Ada Leverson, the writer Oscar Wilde called 'the Sphinx', means that talking to him is not only fascinating but ghostly, too; he connects you to a past that you've previously heard about only via fat biographies. He is not a name dropper, but the names, nevertheless, tumble out: Henrietta Moraes, Sonia Orwell, Diana Melly... </p> <p>At one point, I ask him about Rhys, whose literary executor he eventually became. A notorious drunk, was she as difficult as they say? 'People say she was always drunk, but she wasn't when I knew her. She had a ... light head. We'd have a cocktail, put Piaf on the gramophone and then we'd gossip. She was very egotistical, but since I was interested in her, that didn't matter. She'd talk about Ford or being a chorus girl.' It takes me a moment to grasp that when he says Ford, he means Ford Madox Ford, the author of The Good Soldier, with whom Rhys had a brief but seismic love affair. See what I mean? It's enough to give anyone goose bumps.</p> <p>Francis Wyndham lives above a dry cleaner's on a busy road in west London, surrounded by books and pictures. It's not exactly where you expect him to live - he comes from rather posh stock - but his attitude to it is of a piece with his personality, which is to say that he sees the good in everything: 'I am rather deaf, so I don't notice the noise.' He grew up in Wiltshire, in the dreamy rural isolation that he describes so beautifully in The Other Garden. His father, a retired colonel, came from a grand family (he was connected to the Wyndhams who owned Petworth House in Sussex, though I'm not sure exactly how) and was much older than his mother, with the result that everything is 'a bit lopsided in my family'. </p> <p>His father's first wife, who died in the flu epidemic that followed the First World War, had given her husband a family long before Francis and his brother came along: two sons, one of whom had been killed in the war, and a daughter, thanks to whom he had met Francis's mother; the two young women were friends, having both been nurses in the war. In Mrs Henderson, a rather revelatory book, I think, he tells the stories of this half-brother and sister. The brother was a painter ('a bit Bohemian; he drank') whose elder daughter was writer Joan Wyndham, and whose younger daughter, Ingrid, married first a Guinness, then Paul Channon, the Tory politician. The sister fell in love with a well-known black actress of the day, and went to live with her in connubial bliss in Harlem.</p> <p>'My father was more like a grandfather, really,' he says. 'He died when I was about 16. But I was very fond of him.' But it was his mother's side of the family that had the greater influence on him, especially Ada, who was difficult and yet always so alive to the world, even as she grew older (after the death of her friend Wilde, a generation of younger men - Harold Acton, Osbert Sitwell, Ronald Firbank - sought her out, seeing her as a fascinating survivor of the faded Yellow Book past). </p> <p>'I was very glamoured by the fact that she was a writer. I was only nine when she died, but I do remember her, and I adored her - and later, I slithered into that literary world, which she was in, too.'</p> <p>After Eton - 'I wasn't bullied, it wasn't David Copperfield; I just didn't want to be there' - he went up to the desolate, empty Oxford of the war, spending just a year there before he was called up. Was he full of dread at what would happen next? 'Not really. One didn't allow oneself to think about what was happening on various fronts. Occasionally, when one was in London, and there were buzz bombs, it was rather exciting, though it sounds awful to say.' Besides, in the end, he saw no action. 'I was at the Britannia Barracks in Norwich, where the army doctor, I discovered later, was known as the Butcher. I kept on going sick. He thought I was pretending. Then I fell off the bars in the gym and broke my ankle. In the convalescent home, they found I had pleurisy and that it was of tubercular origin, at which point I was out.' </p> <p>He thinks he may have caught the infection from the woman on whom he based the mysterious Kay, heroine of The Other Garden, a painting of whom hangs on his wall to this day; a woman who is more than the narrator's friend, yet less than her lover, and who, thanks to her own TB, dies tragically young.</p> <p>Though he never went back to Oxford, soon after he began writing reviews for the TLS, whose fiction editor was Anthony Powell. 'It was a very Grub Street-George Gissing sort of a life - you know, selling your review copies. There was this place on the Strand we all went to. It was very embarrassing; sometimes - you'd see the author of the book you were selling.' Then, in 1953, he made a resolution that he should get a proper job. So he did, in publishing. First, he worked for a man called Derek Verschoyle, a character straight out of Muriel Spark's A Far Cry From Kensington (i.e. a fly-by-night), and later for Andr\u00e9 Deutsch. He was a reader. One day, he was sitting in his reading room when Diana Athill, then an editor at Deutsch, came in and asked him to look at something by one VS Naipaul. 'Yes, I made friends with Vidia, and with Jean,' he says, now. 'But I don't want to go on boasting about this.' Oh, go on. Boast away! 'Well, in the case of Jean, I thought she was dead. I'd shown her books to Diana, who had loved them, but said we couldn't reprint. Why did I think she was dead? Julian Maclaren-Ross [Soho diarist and dandy] had told me she was dead - she'd died in an asylum or sanitorium or something - and stupidly, I believed him. Then she was discovered! [By Athill, in the Radio Times, improbable as this may sound.] So I wrote to her and she wrote back and said she was writing something, and this was Wide Sargasso Sea. She would send it to me as she was writing it, bit by bit. It was so exciting. I know that she was difficult, that she had her rages, but I only ever witnessed one rage and that was about being old. I was very moved by it. She knew I was a great fan of her writing. I think she knew, too, that she was good and that quite a lot of people couldn't see that she was good. So we had all that unspoken between us. She was a bit frail, like an actress. Sonia Orwell and I used to stay in a hotel near where she lived in Devon and take her out. She lived in a prefab kind of house. She didn't want a biography but, in the end, I betrayed her and allowed one.' He sighs. 'I know why she didn't. She didn't come out of it well.'</p> <p>Wyndham left Deutsch to join Queen magazine (Mark Boxer, its art editor, was a friend); he was its theatre critic, then its literary editor. Then, in 1964, he followed Boxer to the Sunday Times magazine and began a new life editing juicy journalism and writing interviews; he often worked with Snowdon, still a friend. Uh oh. I reviewed the new biography of Snowdon; he sounds awful.</p> <p>'Yes, I saw your review,' says Wyndham, sweetly. 'It's hard to explain. He's fascinating to be with, though it's true that he never reads a book. Often, we used to go on assignments and he'd never heard of the person. \"Do tell me who this Tolkien is,\" he'd say. But I rather loved that.' </p> <p>It was Wyndham who brought Bruce Chatwin, then just a 'brilliant young person at Sotheby's', to the magazine as its artistic adviser and it was Wyndham who encouraged him to write, commissioning him to write a piece about Madame Vionnet. What was he like? 'I absolutely loved him. I found him life-enhancing. You wouldn't see him for ages, then he would just turn up. He was a bit like Jean; he would talk about what he wanted to talk about. It was a monologue, but it was a monologue that I wanted to hear.' </p> <p>Did Wyndham know when Chatwin, now famous for his exaggerations, was telling the truth? 'Well, I don't really like travel books and Bruce is famous as a travel writer. So when people say he invented a lot of In Patagonia - that's probably why I liked it.' </p> <p>His other great friend from this time, though he can't remember exactly when he met her, was Henrietta Moraes, the model whom Francis Bacon painted 16 times. During her period as an unsuccessful cat burglar (she was also a drug addict and alcoholic), it fell to Wyndham to guarantee her bail. 'I met her at a party. When I first knew her, she was beautiful, adventurous, but vulnerable. She became a liability after a time. She and her boyfriend burgled a house in Hampstead, and then passed out on the Heath with what they'd stolen. But when she appeared in court, she came over all Francis Bacon to the judge. [He adopts a camp Cockney sort of voice]. \"Ooh, I don't like you, dear! I don't fancy you!\" Once, she was on a shoplifting charge. She'd taken something from Wallis. Well, she was outraged. \"As if anyone would hoist from there!\" But she had, of course. It did get...' A bit much? 'Yes. But she was sensitive. She gave me a holiday in the end. We remained friends to the end, and I helped her with her book [of memoirs]. I went on loving Henrietta.' </p> <p>Did he know Bacon? 'Yes, but I wasn't at the heart of that scene. I don't think Bacon liked me and I didn't buy the whole thing. I'm not certain of his greatness.'</p> <p>Wyndham finally left the Sunday Times in 1980. He was ready to leave; he had ideas for more of the stories that eventually became Mrs Henderson. But still, this was a difficult time. His mother died and he gave up smoking. He entered a kind of thoughtful retirement - sometimes writing, but mostly not - which has continued ever since. He lives alone, but his unerring capacity for friendship seems to have protected him from the things that sometimes happen to those who live alone; he is still resolutely in the world, awake to its possibilities in a way that many older people are not. Does he despise being old? 'I think I always was! I think it rather suits me. For some people, the point of them is that they are young: Jean, Henrietta. But not me. Some people get very bitter when they get older; they hate modern painting or whatever. Not me. And I like an excuse for not doing things. I've always been one for saying, \"Oh, shall we just not bother?\"' He laughs. </p> <p>I don't know if there have been love affairs, unrequited or otherwise. Probably. But there is a marvellous story in Mrs Henderson in which the narrator becomes so desperate to avoid the concerned yet needy phone calls of his pals following the death of his mother that he absents himself temporarily from their incessant ringing by pretending to be involved in an affair. For the benefit of the friend who thinks he's gay, he makes up a male lover; for the friend who believes him to be straight, he invents a girl. With funny results. Does he look back at his life, so amazingly rich and full, with astonishment? 'Oh, yes. I have been very lucky. Of course, there have been long periods of my life when nothing seemed to happen at all. But I tried to put those in my work. Rather a lot of life is spent in a kind of limbo. ' </p> <p>For the first time since we have been talking, his hands are now still, clasped prayerfully, perhaps in thanks that, with the publication of his collected work, the latest of these periods has now been triumphantly punctuated. </p> <p>\u00b7 The Other Garden and Collected Stories will be published by Picador on 5 September</p> <h2>Francis Wyndham: A life</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Francis Guy Percy Wyndham in London, 1924. Worked as a staff writer at the Sunday Times (1964-1980) and as an editor at Andr\u00e9 Deutsch. Credited in the 1950s with the rediscovery of Jean Rhys, whose letters he also published after her death. </p> <p><strong>Key works</strong> Out of the War (1974), a short-story collection written during his teens; Mrs Henderson and Other Stories (1985); The Other Garden (1987), which won the Whitbread First Novel Award; The Theatre of Embarrassment (1991), a collection of essays.</p> <p><strong>He says:</strong> 'What I've always wanted to do in fiction is to write about the hours and hours and hours, the enormous proportion of life which is spent in a kind of limbo, even in people's active years. It seems to me that it isn't sufficiently celebrated.'</p> <p><strong>They say: </strong>'He belongs in a tradition of social comedy going back through Henry James to Jane Austen' - Alan Hollinghurst<br><strong>Imogen Carter</strong></p>",
  "<p>It began when five men stole into the rustic village of Tkviavi. With its plum trees, walnut groves and vines, Tkviavi was one of a jigsaw of picturesque villages beneath the hulking mountains of central Georgia. Up the road was Tskhinvali - the grim Soviet-style capital of the backward rebel statelet of South Ossetia. Down the road was Gori, a town once more famous for its association with an unpromising cobbler's son, Josef Stalin.</p> <p>The men arrived outside Elene Maisuradze's modest cottage. Waving guns and speaking rapidly in Russian, they wanted to know where Elene had hidden her Lada. One of them was Ossetian; the others had come from Russia. 'I told them I had sold it,' she said. 'They asked me: \"Where are the boys?\" I said my sons were away. They took everything from my house, turned it upside down and left.'</p> <p>Soon more paramilitaries, armed with Kalashnikovs, turned up. 'They wanted to know where my basement was. I told them and said: \"We have plenty of wine. Please take it.\" They went to the basement, shot it up and came back. I was crying. They said in Russian: \"Rastreli, rastreli (kill her, kill her).\" My neighbour, a Russian woman, told them: \"Don't do this.\" They shot into the ground and said: \"Fuck Saakashvili.\" '</p> <p>The militia gangs were part of a murderous wave unleashed by Russia last week on Georgian civilians. The Russian army has now advanced deep into Georgian territory, capturing at least a third of the country, including Gori, the Black Sea port of Poti and the western towns of Senaki and Zugdidi. Yesterday they were within 12 miles of Tbilisi, the capital.</p> <p>At the same time, gangs of Chechen and Ossetian irregulars have been busy carrying out their own private ethnic cleansing. All week fires burned in Tkviavi, Karaleti, Eredvi and other looted villages along the South Ossetian border; smoke plumed across the valley and into the hazy Upper Caucasus.</p> <p>Survivors described how the irregulars roamed from house to house. They sifted out villagers with Georgian surnames, immediately executing all teenage boys. Nugzari Jashashvili, 65, was returning home across the fields when he saw gunmen approach the house of his neighbour, Gela Chikladze, 50. 'They cut his throat,' Jashashvili said. The same five-man gang looted his house and stole his generator.</p> <p>Jasashvili said the gunmen killed his cousin Koba, 40, and another man. They took two other local men hostage. After watching his neighbour's murder, Jashashvili hid in a cornfield.</p> <p>Once they had gone, he escaped, fleeing for three days across the fields towards Gori. 'We lived off peaches, apples and plums,' Jashashvili said. 'There wasn't any water. We drank very little.'</p> <p>Those spared were mainly the elderly. After gunmen came to her home Maisuradze, 73, also fled, packing an icon and other possessions in two plastic bags, and leaving the village on foot. 'The gunmen were laughing at us,' she said. One of her group - a 93-year-old woman - died on the road. 'We had to leave her,' Maisuradze said. She passed through burning villages full of corpses. 'There were bodies everywhere. I saw two dead women from my village lying on the ground. Everything was on fire.'</p> <p>Russia's war in Georgia is about more than just punishing Mikheil Saakashvili, Georgia's pro-American President, whose doomed military incursion into South Ossetia 10 days ago caused the most serious crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War.</p> <p>The objectives of Russia's Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, are much bigger: to create a new global order in which the US and Russia are equal partners again. Putin has frequently lamented the demise of the Soviet Union. He has described it as the greatest geo-political catastrophe of the 20th century. For Putin, the 1990s under Boris Yeltsin was a period of national humiliation in which a weakened Russia was forced to accept Western economic help and which saw former members of the Warsaw Pact embrace Nato, the West's military club.</p> <p>Over the past two years, Putin has given ample warning of his intentions to overturn the status quo in international affairs. Last year in Munich he launched a vituperative attack on America, denouncing its 'unilateralism'. The Kremlin has criticised Nato's westward expansion and the Bush administration's deal with Warsaw last week to site missile defence systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. Nato membership for Ukraine and Georgia would, Putin made clear, be the final straw.</p> <p>Putin's aim, it appears, is to rewrite history, in particular the narrative that suggests that Russia lost the Cold War. Over the previous eight years as President, he has fashioned Russia into an advanced post-modern authoritarian state, governed by former KGB officers whose attitudes to the West were forged under communism. Putin has apparently never been reconciled to Russia's new boundaries, which left millions of ethnic Russians living outside the borders of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, Georgia, the Baltic states and Central Asia.</p> <p>Nor is there any doubt about ordinary Russians' views about the war in Georgia. 'Suck it and cry,' announced one piece of graffiti on a Moscow wall, an opinion echoed by most Muscovites.</p> <p>'The Georgians were absolutely in the wrong,' said Igor Pavlov, 23, a driver.</p> <p>'They got what they were asking for.' Andrei Teryoshin, a 35-year-old businessman, agreed: 'We were fighting to defend the people of South Ossetia, and I am proud of that.'</p> <p>Anatoly Pavlov, a theatre director, went further: 'I want to complain about the one-sided reporting from the West. Your reports are not correct; they are not right. The West has been reflecting only the Georgian point of view.' Nor was there any doubt about who was the initial aggressor.</p> <p>'It's perfectly obvious - Georgia, of course. And it's not the first time either,' said pensioner Felix Bezik.</p> <p>'This Saakashvili bloke, it's clear he's just an American puppet,' added Ivan Sidorov, 63, a sports instructor. 'That's how I see it: either he's sick or he's evil, the way he's treated Russia.'</p> <p>At the same time analysts at the Kremlin have given free rein to conspiracy theories. Sergei Markov put the Caucasus crisis down to a dastardly plot by Dick Cheney, US Vice-President, and Republican presidential candidate John McCain. A confrontation with Russia would be extremely useful just before the US presidential election, exposing Democratic candidate Barack Obama's inexperience in foreign and security policy and boosting McCain's chances. Such is the paranoid world view of an analyst well connected to the entourage of Vladimir Putin, who guarantee that such scenarios get an extensive airing on the Kremlin-controlled TV channels.</p> <p>With such views being expressed at home, Putin clearly feels he is in a strong domestic position as he presses to get back some of Russia's old territory. Georgian observers expect Putin swiftly to absorb Georgia's secessionist provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which broke away from Tbilisi during the 1992-93 civil war. Both regions are likely to hold popular referendums on a formal or semi-formal union with the Russian Federation. Russia will justify this de facto annexation by pointing to the need to protect Abkhaz and Ossetian citizens from Georgian aggression.</p> <p>'I expect this to happen within a couple of days,' said Zaza Gachechildaze, a Georgian analyst who predicted a war between Russia and Georgia in August. South Ossetia would vote to unify with Russian North Ossetia, while Abkhazia would declare itself independent and then associate with Russia, he said. Nor will this bring an end to Putin's ambitions, he said. His next target is likely to be Ukraine - in particular, the Crimea, home to Russia's Black Sea Fleet.</p> <p>For Nana Tetsladi, 35, there were no doubts last week about Putin's ruthlessness, or his nonchalant defiance of world opinion. Russian Sukhoi SU-25 bombers pulverised her five-floor block of flats last Sunday, targeting the residential suburb of Verxvebi, on the outskirts of Gori. They bombed for three consecutive days.</p> <p>'We fled 15 minutes before the bombs hit,' Nana said. Not everyone managed to get out, she added. Her pregnant neighbour, Marca, was killed, she said, together with her husband. Their seven-year-old son was injured. The twisted remains of Marca's car still stood outside yesterday, a blackened ruin, smelling of burnt flesh.</p> <p>The bombs also fell on Gori's Stalin Square, next to the grandiose Soviet-era museum to Stalin and the green railway carriage in which the dictator travelled to the 1945 Yalta conference. At least five civilians, including a Dutch journalist, were killed. With no discernible military target, it seems clear that the Kremlin was effecting its own form of collective punishment on the town, 17 miles from the border with South Ossetia.</p> <p>Two days after Russia's President, Dimitry Medvedev, announced he was halting military operations, Russian tanks rolled into the centre of Gori, parking outside its sandstone church. This swift action took residents by surprise.</p> <p>'I saw a soldier on the street. I assumed he was Georgian and asked him in Georgian for a light. He turned round and spoke in Russian,' Giorgi Maraneli, 48, said. 'He gave me a match and we shook hands.'</p> <p>Russian tanks took up positions just outside Gori, chopping the road that connects the east and west of the country and dividing Tbilisi from its Black Sea holiday coast. Yesterday Georgia said Russia bombed the last rail link between the two divided halves, dismembering the small nation still further.</p> <p>The mood on this new front line has sometimes been friendly. Young, multi-ethnic Russian soldiers posed for photographs as armoured personnel carriers clattered through the undergrowth, noisily squashing small fir trees and leaving swirling patterns on the grey tarmac. One 30-year-old Russian officer, Major Nail, from Dagestan, turned out to be both witty and philosophical. Why had he invaded Georgia? 'There isn't any difference between Georgia and Russia,' he suggested. This was his first trip to Georgia, he said, adding: 'The landscape is beautiful. But we also have big mountains in Dagestan.'</p> <p>This innocuous mood is clearly illusory. On Thursday, a drunken South Ossetian general arrived at the Russian checkpoint in a stolen white Lada. He got out, puffing and red-faced, removed his pistol and started firing in the air. One of his henchmen fired into the ground; he then hijacked a United Nations Jeep. A battered mini-van carrying South Ossetian paramilitaries and flying the Russian flag careened down the road to Tbilisi. One was wearing a black balaclava; all were heavily armed; their mood was exuberant. Asked what they were doing, one joked: 'We're on holiday.'</p> <p>After fleeing for three days, Elene Maisuradze began trudging along the dusty road from Gori back to Tbilisi, 40 miles away. Five other villagers had come with her - an old woman dressed in black; a vigorous woman in her seventies and a couple with a young son wearing a green tracksuit. They had clearly come together in a collective struggle to stay alive. A Russian armoured column approached. The group dived into fields and hid behind a mud embankment. After five minutes they emerged - keening and weeping.</p> <p>'My husband died 14 years ago. I wish I'd died soon after him. I can't walk any more,' Maisuradze said, halting under a tree next to a petrol station. She put down her stick and showed off the few possessions she had salvaged - black-and-white photos of her as a young woman, a Bible and her icon of the Virgin Mary. 'My generation grew up during the Second World War. We were always crying. It was a terrible situation,' she said. She added: 'Now I'm old and I'm in a war again.'</p> <p>With Georgia's army beaten off the field of battle, the Kremlin has sent columns of armoured vehicles trundling through the scenic countryside. Every day the Russians get closer to Tbilisi; yesterday they were blocking a junction 12 miles away.</p> <p>These advances have caused panic in Georgia's shattered military. The Georgians have modern kit and American-style Toyota Jeeps, but they have no air force left and no tanks, and are no match for the Russian war machine.</p> <p>These theatrical Russian advances have a clear purpose: to menace Saakashvili and to underscore the irrelevance of European and US diplomacy. Nobody doubts that Putin wants to overthrow Georgia's pro-Western government. It is also personal: Putin's loathing for Saakashvili is boundless, Georgian officials say. 'The idea is to punish Georgia and the Georgian government. And Misha [Saakashvili]. They hate Misha,' said Irakli Batkuashvili, the head of Georgia's military planning division.</p> <p>On Friday, the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, condemned Russia's invasion of Georgia and called for an 'immediate withdrawal' of Russian troops. She also said the 'free world' needed to start a debate about the 'profound implications' of Russia's actions. 'You can't be a responsible member of institutions that are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours,' Rice said, after holding almost five hours of talks with Saakashvili at his unfinished hilltop palace in Tbilisi. As she spoke, nine Russian armoured personnel carriers rolled towards her press conference.</p> <p>So far, however, the US assistance to occupied Georgia has only comprised moral support and humanitarian aid. The Bush administration has no plans to offer its ally military assistance with which to take on the Russians. Moreover, the 'free world' has found few levers with which to punish Putin.</p> <p>Rice's comments about the need for the West to re-evaluate its relationship with Moscow appear to be a hint that Russia could soon be excluded - formally or otherwise - from the G8 and other international institutions. The West's most stinging gesture would be to take away the 2014 Winter Olympics from Russia: they are due to be held in Sochi, 12 miles from Abkhazia.</p> <p>None of this is likely to bother the Kremlin much. As Saakashvili pointed out on Friday, the Kremlin has tested the West's reactions with a series of provocative steps, discovering each time that the Europeans generally don't do anything. Dubbing Russia's leadership 'evil' and '21st-century barbarians', Saakashvili lambasted the EU for its feebleness. The Russians had dispatched agents to murder Alexander Litvinenko in a 'nuclear attack', poisoned Ukraine's President, Viktor Yushchenko, and - last month, during Rice's last visit - sent jet fighters into Georgian airspace. The Europeans did nothing, he said. 'Russia has been all the time testing the reactions of the West. It's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere,' he warned.</p> <p>Certainly there was little sign of any strength of European outrage at events in Georgia. Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in particular, has said that both sides are to blame, a comment suggesting that Germany's relations with Russia are more important to her than Georgia's struggle for survival.</p> <p>Indeed, it was only until the middle of last week that Europe made any significant diplomatic move to try to end the crisis in Georgia, when the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, exploiting France's European Union presidency, intervened. Kouchner was dispatched first to Tbilisi, then to Moscow, to explore the prospects for a ceasefire and to gauge whether Sarkozy could profit from heading east. The Russians would be happy to talk to Sarkozy, he reported back to the Elys\u00e9e, so the French President went to Moscow and spent hours haggling with Putin instead.</p> <p>The result was a six-point ceasefire plan, essentially on Russia's terms, which Sarkozy then took to Saakashvili in Tbilisi for a midnight session. The proposed pact was a bitter blow to Georgian sovereignty, curbing the activity of its military on its own territory while giving Russia the right to mount patrols and take 'additional security measures' on sovereign Georgian territory. For its part, America was alarmed, though supporting the peace bid in public. En route to Tbilisi, Rice stopped off in France to stiffen Sarkozy's sinews and try to shape the mediation effort.</p> <p>At first the Kremlin said it was in no hurry to sign a deal and only announced late last week that President Medvedev had agreed to the plan. However, Sarkozy could not get Saakashvili to sign at first, and it was only when Rice arrived that the Georgian leader backed down and flourished his pen, bolstered by US emphasis that the Russian security concessions would be limited in time and space. As Rice headed for the presidential ranch in Crawford, Texas, to brief Bush, it appeared that Putin had gambled and won.</p> <p>Nor is it surprising that European reaction to the invasion of Georgia has been so limited. The Europeans - quite simply - have more to lose. Like the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago this week, this invasion took place in August. But it is in winter that the Kremlin can exploit Europe's great weakness - by cutting off its oil and gas supplies.</p>",
  "<p>Finally, late last night, the hare got away. For 75 years it has been chased, literally hounded, by 12, 13 generations of greyhounds; never caught, but never safe. Today and forever it will be left alone. True, it's not much of a hare, more of an electric orange sock with tassles. And, true, it's not much of a silver lining.</p> <p>Walthamstow dog track closed, lost most likely forever, shortly after 11.03pm. It was an exuberant night; filled with floodlights and cheers and a thunderous last crowd, a welter of good-natured delight behind the glorious Art Deco neon of its famous frontage. But there was an inescapable undertow of sadness; even the children got it. Of regrets, of memories; and, near the end, some quiet dignified tears, and at the very end, a typically Walthamstow ending. Three minutes after the very last race, won by Mountjoy Diamond (for the record, the last dog ever was three seconds behind - Blue Kanaka), 2,000 people climbed the small barriers and began to run round the sandy track. Thousands more followed. It turned into a march, a happy, slightly drunken, resigned march. </p> <p>The Chandler family, heirs to the 1930s bookie who built and opened this vivid symbol of working-class fun and helped build the sport until it had 50 million fans a year, have been forced through mounting losses to sell the partially listed building to housing developers. Despite an immensely spirited rearguard action from locals, it looks as if this is - was - the end. At least 50 full-time jobs will be gone, and more than 400 part-time. Crucially, this benighted part of Waltham Forest has nothing else.</p> <p>Go to the Walthamstow dogs during the daytime and you can see why, slowly, it died. Investment seems to have stopped in about 1970. Signs miss letters and lie broken. Three little tractors sit, forlorn, in the middle of the sand, and litter blows. The apparently more upmarket Paddock Bar - melon on crushed ice, 'Pineapple combined with dairy ice cream and returned to its shell' - hasn't changed its menu much since the year it played host to a teensy David Beckham and his first job, collecting glasses. In the main bar the smell of chips is more than pervasive. But, still, there is the sense of history - about to be made, and about to end. I find Les Hunt, 76, walking the track, in the dying light, remembering his own dogs, his own times. 'Jen was the best. Fed her on pearl barley and cow heel. Glorious dog.' </p> <p>The younger ones remember Blur's Parklife cover and Brad Pitt's visit. All remember good, good times and all are miserable at the closure, and intensely sceptical about the chances of any flats ever being built, or of thousands - who? who? - waiting to buy them.</p> <p>All of them, old and young, form the best-natured sporting crowd I have ever met. There is courtesy, and laughter. Old men and young tattooed geezers fall over themselves to explain the racecard to mewling infants and the occasional backwards adult, such as myself. Even on this night there is much laughter, although some of the older stalwarts, especially the bookies, have a thousand-yard stare. 'That's it, that's me now,' says Ron Bazell. 'Livelihood gone. Life gone, really.' Ron is 80. I have just taken \u00a335 off him. I give it back. Admittedly, bit by bit.</p> <p>As the sun goes down, the lights beam, the tat recedes and this place is transformed, and I suddenly understand. Glittering, glorious, fabulous. The dogs, with their impossible waists and eager smiles, simply blast, they explode, and an entire community becomes, for 23 seconds, rapt, mesmerised, alive. It becomes impossible to imagine this dying; but that is exactly what happens. Starting today. There goes the neighbourhood.</p> <p>There are times when you suspect the phrase 'hare-brained' does a vast disservice to the animal. At least the damned hare, albeit in the guise of a small electric sock, ran and ran and ran.</p>",
  "<p>It's not easy writing about summer wines when you never know if you'll be drinking in the garden or huddled indoors, but those of us who live in these islands have learned to put up with awful weather.</p> <p>But let's pretend the (wine) glass is half-full rather than half-empty. Let's imagine ourselves sitting in a deckchair with a good book and a bottle of decent wine. That's what I tried to do as I selected my favourite summer tipples. No fireside reds. In fact, no reds at all. Just whites, ros\u00e9s and a bit of good fizz. I've tasted more wines than ever this year. And no, I don't expect you to reach for the nearest violin. </p> <p>I don't keep an exact tally, but I reckon I've done the old sniff, gurgle and spit routine about 8,000 times already and we've still got four months to go. The good news as far as you are concerned is that you don't have to taste some of the crap that I do. At least two-thirds of those wines are of little interest to you or me.</p> <p>Inevitably, my summer selection reflects my prejudices, but I've tried to pick as broad a selection of wines and prices as possible, so that there's something for everyone. There are wines from 11 different countries (France, Italy, Spain, Australia, Portugal, Argentina, Chile, Austria, New Zealand, Slovenia and the United States), made from a host of grape varieties and reflecting dozens of different styles. Even if the weather remains unpredictable, summer won't seem so bad if you stock up on a few of these. </p> <h2>Under \u00a36</h2> <p><strong>Fizz: Asda Cava Brut, Cordiniu </strong><br>(\u00a33.98, 11.5%, Asda)</p> <p>Unusually for a Cava, this is based on Chardonnay, rather than the trio of local Catalan grapes. It also has 10% reserve wine for extra richness. The result is a crisp, slightly peppery fizz at an unbelievable price.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 C\u00f4tes de Gascogne, Producteurs Plaimont</strong><br>(\u00a34.99, 11.5%, Marks &amp; Spencer)</p> <p>The Plaimont co-operative is one of the most impressive in France, making well-priced whites with lots of flavour. This blend of Colombard and Ugni Blanc is zesty and unoaked with crisp, refreshing acidity and restrained alcohol.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 La Diff\u00e9rence Viognier/Muscat, Vin de Pays d'Oc</strong><br>(\u00a35.25, 13%, Tesco)</p> <p>This innovative blend of Viognier with 30% Muscat, sold under the exciting La Diff\u00e9rence label, is a delight; a floral, grapey, just off-dry white with bags of personality and plenty of ripe, summery fruit.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Casa Mia Fiano, Sicily </strong><br>(\u00a35.29, 13%, Sainsbury's)</p> <p>Is Fiano the new Pinot Grigio? I certainly hope so, because Settesoli in Sicily is making really good, value-for-money whites from this characterful Italian white. This has ripe melon and mango flavours and a soft, mouth-filling texture.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Asda Extra Special White Burgundy, Cave de Buxy</strong><br>(\u00a35.98, 12.5%, Asda) </p> <p>The Extra Special tag isn't always a guarantee of quality at Asda, but this lightly oaked white Burgundy from the excellent Buxy co-operative is very tasty at the price, with notes of citrus fruit and peach and a refreshing minerality.</p> <p><strong>Rose: 2007 Tagus Creek Shiraz/Touriga Nacional Ros\u00e9, Ribatejo</strong><br>(\u00a35.49, 13%, Waitrose)</p> <p>A total contrast to the light, slightly confected characters of Mateus Ros\u00e9, this dry, richly coloured blend of Shiraz and Touriga Nacional is a perfect picnic pink, with notes of cherries and raspberries and a nip of tannin for backbone. </p> <h2>Under \u00a37</h2> <p><strong>White: 2007 Oxford Landing Viognier, South Australia </strong><br>(\u00a35.99, 13.5%, Sainsbury's)</p> <p>It's hard to get Viognier right under \u00a36 - the grape often tastes flabby and bitter - but Yalumba's Oxford Landing brand just gets better and better. This is creamy and apricotty with enough acidity to balance the variety's natural weight.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Storks' Tower Sauvignon Blanc/Verdejo, Rueda</strong> <br>(\u00a35.99, 13%, Tesco)</p> <p>Spanish white wines have improved out of all recognition in the past five years, mainly thanks to modern techniques and the quality of local grapes such as Verdejo, combined here with Sauvignon to produce a crisp, tangy, grapefruity blend.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Pinot Grigio, Bidoli Vini, Venezie </strong><br>(\u00a35.99, 13%, Marks &amp; Spencer)</p> <p>A Pinot Grigio with character? You read it here first. This rich, weighty, peachy, textured Venetian white has all of the good things of this most fashionable of varieties but none of the bad. It's worth paying a little extra for the privilege.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 La Esperanza Estate Torront\u00e9s, Cafayate</strong> <br>(\u00a35.99, 13%, Marks &amp; Spencer)</p> <p>If Argentina has a white USP to compare with red Malbec, it is surely Torront\u00e9s, especially from the high-altitude area of Cafayate. This is complex, dry and almost indecently fragrant, with aromas of fresh grapes and lemon zest.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 La Grille Cool Fermented Chenin Blanc</strong><br>(\u00a35.99, or \u00a34.99 each for two, 11%, Majestic)</p> <p>For a wine with so much flavour, this is surprisingly light in alcohol. In style, it's arguably as close to Cape Chenin as it is to the more traditional whites of Loire, with ripe, honey and tropical fruit characters and crisp, appley acidity.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Quinta de Azevedo Vinho Verde </strong><br>(\u00a35.99, 11%, Waitrose) </p> <p>I know this is a regular feature of my selections, but the latest vintage of this textbook Vinho Verde is as good as ever. It's zesty, light and refreshing with bone-dry flavours of apples and lemons and a light of carbon dioxide.</p> <h2>Under \u00a38</h2> <p><strong>Fizz: Ravelli Prosecco Raboso Spumante, Veneto </strong><br>(\u00a37.69, 11%, Tesco) </p> <p>The addition of a 49% red Raboso to white Prosecco gives colour as well as a raspberryish undertone to this enjoyable, well-priced Italian fizz. It's perfumed, slightly sweet but incredibly gluggable on a warm summer's evening.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Clos d'Yvigne, Princesse de Cleves Bergerac Sec</strong> <br>(\u00a37.99, or \u00a37.49 each for two, 13.5%, Majestic)</p> <p>A wild, pleasantly funky blend of Sauvigno Blanc, Semillon and Muscadelle from ex-pat Patricia Atkinson's impressive Bergerac operation. This is toasty and complex with refreshing minerality and real depth for a sub-\u00a38 white.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Verus Vineyards Furmint, Slovenia </strong><br>(\u00a37.99, 12%, The Real Wine Company 01753 885619)</p> <p>It's good to see an importer taking a punt on a few wines from Slovenia. This screwcapped white, made from the grape variety that has made Tokaj famous, is floral, soft and aromatic, with flavours of apples and pears and a crisp finish.</p> <p><strong>Rose: 2007 Ch\u00e2teau Pigoudet La Chapelle Ros\u00e9, Coteaux d'Aix </strong><br>(\u00a37.99, or \u00a36.99 each for two, 13%, Majestic)</p> <p>If I had to survive on only one ros\u00e9 on holiday in Provence this summer, this Syrah/Grenache blend would be it. It's a very pale, delicate style with subtle cherry and wild strawberry nuances, crisp acidity and a refreshing, savoury finish.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Villa Antinori Bianco, Marchesi Antinori, IGT Toscana</strong> <br>(\u00a37.99, 12%, Morrisons)</p> <p>Antinori is much better known as a red wine producer, but its whites are improving with every vintage. This blend of Trebbiano with Malvasia, Chardonnay, Pinot Bianco and Pinot Grigio is crisp and zingy with juniper and aniseed notes.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Santa Rita Floresta Sauvignon Blanc, Leyda </strong><br>(\u00a38.99, 14.1% Waitrose)</p> <p>Chilean Sauvignon Blanc has improved out of all recognition in the past few years, and can now stand comparison with the very best. This cool climate example is ripe and concentrated, but still crisp and grapefruity on the palate.</p> <h2>Under \u00a39</h2> <p><strong>White: 2007 Domaine Lafage, Cuv\u00e9e Centenaire, C\u00f4tes du Roussillon </strong><br>(\u00a38.49, 13.5%, Bibendum, 020 7449 4120)</p> <p>If the world were a fairer place, the white wines of the Roussillon would be bracketed with the great wines of the world. This complex, mealy, minerally blend of Grenache Blanc and a little Roussanne is toasty and lively.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Crego e Monaguillo Godello, Monterrei</strong><br>(\u00a38.99, or two each for \u00a37.49, 13%, Majestic)</p> <p>Godello is arguably Spain's most up-and-coming white variety at the moment, a variety that tastes like a more tropical version of Austria's Gr\u00fcner Veltliner. Greengage, melon and aniseed flavours with good richness behind them.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 O'Leary Walker Polish Hill River Riesling, Clare Valley</strong> <br>(\u00a38.99, 12.5%, Waitrose)</p> <p>David O'Leary's Rieslings don't get the credit they deserve in my view. For me, this wine is consistently one of the best value whites from Down Under, a complex, dry, lime-scented Riesling of real purity, length and finesse.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 M\u00e2con, Terroir de Charnay, Domaine Cordier</strong><br>(\u00a39.99, or \u00a38.99 each for two, 13.5%, Majestic)</p> <p>If you're a white Burgundy drinker on a budget, I'd be tempted to avoid the more expensive offerings from the C\u00f4te de Beaune and buy a bottle of this chalky, focused, sensitively oaked stunner instead. </p> <h2>Under \u00a310</h2> <p><strong>White: 2006 Tahbilk Marsanne, Nagambie Lakes </strong><br>(\u00a39.99, 13%, Sainsbury's; \u00a36.66 each for three, Wine Rack)</p> <p>One of the few Australian whites that is guaranteed to age for a decade or more, Tahbilk's Marsanne is one of Victoria's finest. This is crisp, taut and unoaked with understated citrus and honeysuckle notes.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Espor\u00e3o Reserva, Alentejo </strong><br>(\u00a39.95, 14%, Charles Hawkins Wines, 01572 823030)</p> <p>An unsual cuv\u00e9e of Arinto, Roupeiro and Ant\u00e3o Vaz from one of leading producers in southern Portugal. Rich and spicy, but showing more than enough bracing acidity for freshness, length and balance.</p> <p><strong>Rose: 2007 Vintage Sancerre Ros\u00e9 Caves des Vins de Sancerre</strong><br>(\u00a310.99, 12.5%, Marks &amp; Spencer)</p> <p>I know there are cheaper pink wines on the market. In fact, outside Champagne it's hard to think of anything with a weightier price tag, but this is delicious: a subtle, dry, if fast-developing Pinot Noir of considerable depth and refinement.</p> <p><strong>White: 2005 Br\u00fcndlmayer Gr\u00fcner Veltliner Berg-Vogelsang, Kamptal </strong><br>(\u00a312.99, 12.5%, Waitrose)</p> <p>There are more opulent Gr\u00fcner Veltliners on the market, most notably from the Wachau, but I prefer the restraint of the Br\u00fcndlmayer style. This is peppery and dry with a touch of honey and a fresh, concentrated, minerally finish.</p> <h2>Under \u00a316</h2> <p><strong>White: 2007 Villa Maria Single Vineyard Ensor Sauvignon Blanc </strong><br>(\u00a312.99, 14%, Budgens)</p> <p>Villa Maria's single vineyard Sauvignon Blancs are some of the best bottlings in Marlborough, each reflecting a different micro-climate. For me, this is the pick of the bunch with distinguished citrus flavours and a touch of spritz. </p> <p><strong>White: 2006 Fiano di Avellino, Terredora, Campania</strong><br>(\u00a314.45, 13%, Jeroboams, 0207 730 8108)</p> <p>If Fiano can lay claims to greatness, as opposed to being the source of decent commercial wines, it will be with examples like this taut, perfumed, almost Sauvignon Blanc-like number from Campania.</p> <p><strong>White: 2006 Saintsbury Chardonnay, Carneros </strong><br>(\u00a315.99, or two each for \u00a312.99, 13.5%, Majestic)</p> <p>Too many California Chardonnays taste of butterscotch and residual sweetness to me, so it's a delight to drink this toasty, elegant, citrus fresh example from one of the West Coast's best exponents of a more restrained Burgundian style.</p> <p><strong>White: 2006 Chablis Premier Cru Quintessence, Jean-Marc Brocard </strong><br>(\u00a315.99, 13%, Tesco)</p> <p>It's great to see a white Burgundy bottled under a screwcap. This is a classic, unoaked Chablis from one of my favourite producers with lots of honeyed concentration, taut acidity and a finish that lasts for nearly a minute.</p> <p><strong>White: 2006 Iroul\u00e9guy Blanc, Hegoxuri, Domaine Arretxea</strong> <br>(\u00a317.65, 13.5%, Les Caves de Pyr\u00e8ne, 01483 554750)</p> <p>A Basque white from the French side of the border, made from a blend of Gros Manseng, Petit Manseng and Petit Courbu, this is a rich, characterful, almost exotic wine.</p> <h2>Over \u00a320</h2> <p><strong>White:2005 Montlouis Le Volagr\u00e9, Domaine St\u00e9phane Cossais </strong><br>(\u00a324, 13.5%, Les Caves de Pyrene, 01483 554750)</p> <p>It might seem a lot to spend nearly \u00a325 on a Loire white, but this really is as good as Chenin Blanc gets. This is a profound, almost magical wine with intense, minerally flavours.</p> <p><strong>White: 2007 Cigalus Blanc, Vin de Pays d'Oc</strong> <br>(\u00a326.99, 13.5%, Oddbins)</p> <p>It takes guts to sell a white wine from the Languedoc at more than \u00a320, but ex-rugby player G\u00e9rard Bertrand is not short of courage. This herbal, complex, sensitively oaked blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc is a stunner. </p> <p><strong>White: 2006 Condrieu Les Terrasses du Palate, Fran\u00e7ois Villard</strong><br>(\u00a330, 14%, Waitrose Wine Direct)</p> <p>If you've ever wondered what all the fuss is about with Viognier, buy yourself a bottle of this lovely, hedonistic white from the Rh\u00f4ne. It's a quintessence of fine Viognier, with notes of sandalwood, freesias and white peach. Delicious.</p> <p><strong>Fizz: 2003 Champagne Grand Cru, Extra Brut, Vieille Vigne de Cramant, Larmandier-Bernier </strong><br>(\u00a334.25, 12.5%, Vine Trail, 0117 921 1770)</p> <p>Even in a very hot year like 2003, Pierre Larmandier makes wines of tremendous elegance and balance. This old wine - all Chardonnay Champagne - is bracingly dry.</p> <p><strong>Fizz: 1998 Alfred Gratien Mill\u00e9sime Champagne </strong><br>(\u00a334.95, 12%, Berry Brothers, 0870 900 4300)</p> <p>Alfred Gratien is one of the few houses that uses wood to ferment its base wines in Champagne. The result is a rich, traditional, dry style with layer upon layer of flavours and fine, palate-tingling bubbles.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron last night called for visa restrictions on Russian citizens wanting to visit Britain to punish Russia for its invasion of Georgia. The Tory leader also called for Moscow to be suspended from the G8 group of industrial nations and for its talks on a partnership agreement with the EU to be frozen. </p> <p>Writing in the Sunday Times, Cameron said it was time for the international community to unite behind measures to show disapproval of Russia's actions.</p> <p>'We must make clear that the path it has chosen leads to isolation and contempt. We should suspend Russia from the G8 and suspend negotiations on a partnership with the European Union,' he said. Russia's elite valued their ties to Europe, particularly 'their shopping and their luxury weekends'. He added: 'Russian armies can't march into other countries while Russian shoppers carry on marching into Selfridges.'</p> <p>Earlier yesterday, Cameron was accused of 'macho posturing' after staging a surprise visit to Georgia to declare solidarity with its citizens. </p> <p>Cameron embarrassed the government by beating ministers to the capital, Tbilisi, for meetings with Georgian leaders on a trip designed to portray him as a potential Prime Minister. However, Downing Street aides said that he had waded into a volatile situation for the sake of a 'photo opportunity', while the Liberal Democrats accused him of raising expectations of Nato membership for the former Soviet satellite that were 'simply not credible'. </p> <p>Cameron insisted that he was there to show support for a threatened democracy and raised fears over reports of what he described as 'appalling atrocities' allegedly carried out by militias in Russian-occupied areas. </p> <p>He said: 'What is required is a very strong response to what is happening. If we just stand by after what Russia has done in Georgia, then where next will Russia intervene?'</p> <p>The Foreign Office, which was anxious about Cameron's trip, is likely to have been mollified by his pointed insistence yesterday that he was representing 'the British people, the British government and the British opposition'. He is understood to have taken advice from the British embassy on the latest developments. However, he repeated his controversial view that Nato membership for Georgia was now 'appropriate'. </p> <p>The Tory leader's visit has irritated Gordon Brown, who has spoken repeatedly to Georgian leaders by phone and is said to be monitoring developments closely while on holiday.</p>",
  "<p>'Trust to your feet, Jossy,' yells Guido, as I scrabble for a foothold with my crampons in the hard-packed ice below me. I can't even feel my feet. I can't look down or sideways. I am clinging, frozen, to a near-vertical wall of rutted, windblown ice at 3,000m, in a 40mph wind, on the side of a volcano in Chile. My backpack, with my skis strapped to it, feels like it's pulling me backwards off the mountain. Finally we reach the summit, and peer over the icy lip of the crater, from which sulphurous smoke is billowing. I am choked up and it's not just the smoke. We have just conquered our first volcano, the magnificent Llaima, all 3,125m of it.</p> <p>For a diehard skier, it's an age-old problem: when the snows melt in Europe and North America, where do you go to get your skiing kicks? I'd often wondered about heading south, to Chile, but the resorts there, such as Valle Nevado and Portillo, didn't seem to offer much more than I could find summer-skiing on the glacier in the French resort of Tignes. Then, on a winter ski trip, I bumped into Phil Smith, owner of tour group Snoworks, who told me about the skiing and climbing trip he runs to Chile. The 15-day tour would involve climbing up and skiing down nine of the volcanoes in Chile's southern Lakes District. Something different, something challenging - it sounded too good to miss.</p> <p>So, several months later, I found myself in the town of Temuco, capital of the Araucan\u00eda region, with Phil and four other experienced skiers - all of them men. A local company, Amity Tours, was to look after us for our two weeks: Cristi\u00e0n the owner, Guido our guide, and Milton the driver, who would ferry us and our gear between the hotels and volcanoes, each of which lay roughly three hours' drive apart. It soon became clear that skiing down the volcanoes would be the - relatively - easy part. Ascending them was where the real challenge lay; a mix of ski lifts, climbing, walking and 'skinning' - walking uphill on skis. </p> <p>The first volcano was Antuco, in the Laguna del Laja National Park. It was a far cry from Val d'Is\u00e8re's groomed slopes and armies of piste bashers, but that was exactly what we'd come for. Chile has some of the world's best off-piste skiing, with untracked snowfields as far as the eye can see. The only problem can be the weather: the rain came down so heavily on Antuco that we had to cut the day short and head off to Corralco mountain lodge in the Malalcahuello National Reserve, from where we would attempt the 2,865m Lonquimay volcano. When we arrived the wind had whipped up and Guido told us we wouldn't be able to begin the climb until midday. Frustrating, but it gave us the chance to appreciate the setting: the dramatic sight of Lonquimay, its gleaming white flanks adorned with the extraordinary araucaria (monkey puzzle) trees that are native to the region. Breathtaking.</p> <p>As was the climb, when it finally began. The hotel's tank-like Ecotrack vehicle took us as far as it could - to the bottom of the first chairlift, which was buried in snow. Chile had had record snowfalls, which meant most of the lifts weren't running. This was my first real introduction to skinning; we attached 'skins' to the underside of our skis, synthetic strips whose fibres all go in one direction so the skis will slide forward but not back, and began the hike upwards. It was incredibly tough: my new boots dug into my shins with every step, and I was sweating buckets. Phil told us that we needed to get into a 'plod mentality', but I didn't feel I could realistically go any slower. We climbed for two hours and were still nowhere near the summit. My thoughts were alternating between 'why am I doing this?' and 'God, it's so beautiful up here'. The scenery is incredible - great jagged snowy peaks against a deep blue sky. And even though, by the end of the climb, my legs had turned to jelly, the ski down made it all worth it. The high altitude meant the snow conditions were perfect - soft and powdery over a firm base. Not being an experienced off-piste skier, I got the chance to appreciate the way the sunlight sparkled through the araucaria trees - as I ended up on my back in the snow several times during the descent.</p> <p>Fortunately, although this was an adventure holiday, we were hardly roughing it. Accommodation ranged from simple but comfortable to the seriously luxurious - and all of it came with warm, Chilean hospitality. At the lakeshore Marina del Puy hotel, in Huilo Huilo Biological Reserve, we were royally wined, dined and entertained by a troupe of local dancers brought in specially to welcome us, while at Los Pioneros lodge we each returned from dinner to find a crackling fire had been lit in the small wood-burning stoves in our rooms.</p> <p>Each day brought new adventures. 'This is puma country,' Cristi\u00e0n told us cheerily as we prepared for the climb up Sollipulli in Villarrica National Reserve. 'Never run away. They attack from behind.' Although thrilled to think we might see a puma, I was a little nervous on that 2,282m climb. It was fairly straightforward, but I had developed painful blisters - due in no small part, according to Guido, to my poor sock choice. This time it was the descent that proved trickier: I felt a little like Bridget Jones as I careered out of control through heavy wet snow. Once we were at the bottom, Guido collected water from a mountain stream. 'It tastes like the best wine when you've been climbing,' he said. Oddly, he was right.</p> <p>At El Mocho, in Huilo Huilo, we were glad to get towed up behind a Snowcat almost to the top of the 2,422m peak. The run down was through fabulous powder, and it was all going rather well, I thought, until I hit a massive rut left by the Snowcat tracks. By this time I had started to get the hang of skinning and even though the next peak, Casablanca, was a straight skin all the way up to 1,990m, we made it up and down by lunchtime. I was increasingly determined to make it up Osorno, our last climb - at 2,652m not the highest, but it's near-vertical ice-capped summit made it by far the toughest.</p> <p>'Look at me, smile, and let go of the rope,' yelled Guido, as I hung beneath the icy white summit of Volcano Osorno. I took a deep breath, took my hands off the rope and dug in my crampons. From somewhere below, Cristi\u00e0n was directing me, 'left a bit, no...left, LEFT', as I bounced in and out of huge ice troughs. Although my legs were like lead after the six-and-a-half-hour climb, the ski down - against the electric-pink glow of the sunset - was truly euphoric. I had made it to the top of Osorno, and I arrived at the bottom grinning from ear to ear, to a round of applause from the other guys. My joy was only slightly dampened by the fact they had already drunk all the beer.</p> <p>It was a spectacular end to an unforgettable fortnight. For experienced ski tourers, this would be the trip of a lifetime. For me, a novice, it was an incredible personal achievement. I had learnt to use skins, crampons and ice axes, and how to abseil. I almost mastered kick-turns, and I developed a taste for cake - for breakfast. 'I am NEVER doing this again,' I had shouted at Guido, when we were half-way up Llaima with aching limbs and sore feet. 'I'll see you at the top of Osorno, Jossy,' came his reply. At that moment I was convinced I wouldn't even try that ascent. But I did it. And now I want to do it all over again. Only this time with much better socks.</p> <h2>The essentials</h2> <p>Jossy Smalley travelled to Chile with Snoworks and Amity Tours (<a href=\"http://www.snoworks.co.uk\">snoworks.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amitytours.cl\">amitytours.cl</a>).

  "<p>This brave venture, presenting Dante's Inferno in 60 minutes, works amazingly well. Virgil (Alex Jennings) guides Dante (Corin Redgrave) through the Circles of Hell and finally to Heavenly Light. The eerie background sounds and cacophony of anguished cries and lamentation are truly haunting as Dante does the Grand Tour of sinners' punishments - flung into boiling tar by the Devil, turned into bleeding trees, locked in ice, wrapped in snakes or consumed by unrelievable itching. The Bosch-like cameos of suffering are so visual, the language so vivid, the sounds so atmospheric that I was as relieved as Dante to see that Heavenly Light.</p>",
  "<h2>Victoria Coren is right: no one likes a busybody</h2> <p>As a magistrate, I started to read Victoria Coren's article ('There's no smoke without ire', 7 Days, last week) prepared to be outraged but I found her comments both brave and profound.</p> <p>It's strange how, as adults, we hate to be told what to do. I was in a queue the other day and a woman whispered in my ear that I was standing at the wrong end. This didn't bother me. I said thank you and moved. But had she said it loudly, I would have been devastated and would probably have walked off in embarrassment and rage; had there been a platform available, I don't think I would have pushed her off, but the air would have been blue inside my head. <br><strong>Patricia Sutton JP</strong><br>Coventry</p> <p>I was appalled by Victoria Coren's piece. As I understand it, Linda Buchanan asked two men to stop smoking on a station platform on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, the same men made a rude sign to her as she walked past. Mrs Buchanan turned round and told them to grow up. They gave her a shove; she lost her balance and fell on to the track.</p> <p>This is not about the rights and wrongs of smoking on station platforms. It is about two thugs who did not like what Mrs Buchanan said to them so they hit her. They hit her so hard that they knocked her off the platform on to the track. Mrs Buchanan had a perfect right to tell these men off for making an obscene gesture. They had no right to hit her. For Coren to say that it served Mrs Buchanan right for being a busybody and a bully is outrageous. <br><strong>Joan Yeadon</strong><br>London N16</p> <h2>Ignor (sic) my words at your peril</h2> <p>Did any of your panellists bother to read my article in last week's Times Higher Education ('Does spelling matter?' Comment, last week), as opposed to commenting on the coverage of this in the media? Apart from Barbara Gunnell, I don't believe they did.</p> <p>Diane Abbott says that 'it is towering stupidity to suggest that we should spell any way we wish'. But who made this suggestion? Not me. All I said was that more variant spellings might be allowed. </p> <p>I am not proposing that we should ignore the 'e' in ignore (Anastasia de Waal), but I am proposing that 'ignor' might be accepted as a widely used variant spelling. This is not the same thing. </p> <p>Karol Sikora's comments - 'Spelling is the essential rule of written communication'; 'Try sending an email with only a single letter incorrect in the address' - are nothing more than a series of truisms.</p> <p>Do I think teaching spelling is 'a frivolous luxury'? No I don't, Professor Sikora. But I do think it is a good thing - good teaching in fact - to question how we teach spelling in schools and universities, especially when so many young people struggle with this.</p> <p>In all the huffing and puffing by the great and the good following the publication of my article, virtually no one has thought to ask the public what they think of my suggestion: not people who are well educated and can spell, but those who struggle with spelling. <br><strong>Dr Kenneth Smith</strong><br>London E2</p> <h2>Don't sleepwalk into global warming</h2> <p>I was sleepwalking. Then I was woken on Sunday by the clash of two articles in your news section.</p> <p>The first told me that the Arctic could be free of ice in five years; the second revealed that the government arrested some people who were trying to stop this happening ('Fifty arrested as Green activists clash with police over proposed coal plant'). </p> <p>Surely it's wrong to put more money into polluting ventures, and surely we should be putting that money into developing, producing and installing every sort of non-polluting energy that we can. If we all - government and individuals - put serious money into the new technologies, we could give our young people employment now, a focus for the future and, above all, hope.<br><strong>Pauline Fothergill</strong><br>West Berkshire</p> <h2>Alan Johnson, route to disaster</h2> <p>If Tony Woodley, joint leader of Unite, believes that the Labour government 'desperately needs to get back to its roots' ('Unions and MPs back \"dream ticket\"', News, last week), surely he cannot be looking to Alan Johnson to save the Labour Party? </p> <p>Johnson is the Secretary of State for Health who champions Foundation Hospitals. He was the Secretary of State for Education and Skills who adored undergraduate top-up fees. As Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, he upped the retirement age for private sector and future public-sector workers. As Employment Relations Minister, he told the Financial Times: 'The TUC left Planet Zog 20-odd years ago... but a few union leaders go back for the occasional day trip,' and in his time at the DTI he began the move to change the Post Office from a public service into a commercial business.</p> <p>Johnson is Blair reincarnate: a route to disaster, not the root of success.<br><strong>Jenny Fisher</strong><br>London E14</p> <h2>Simplify university application</h2> <p>Universities have rightly criticised a new system in which pupils who do unexpectedly well at A-level will be given five days after receiving their results to apply elsewhere ('Students to \"trade up\" for better college', last week). </p> <p>However, this confusing fudge has arisen as a direct result of the efforts of a significant number of universities to delay moves towards a system of post-qualification applications. Such a system would be far more simple and equitable than the present over-reliance on predicted grades. Research also suggests that poorer students are more likely to be adversely affected by teachers underestimating their performance.<br><strong>Wes Streeting</strong><br>President, National Union of Students<br>London NW1 </p> <h2>China is on the right track</h2> <p>Nick Cohen reaches an unnecessarily gloomy conclusion about China's capacity for environmental protection. In the 10 years I've been conducting research on energy in China, there has been a huge change in attitudes there. This is not just because the impacts of pollution have become so severe; it is also in China's economic self-interest to become less polluting. As the Chinese government argues, the energy-intensive mode of growth that has characterised China's rise is not sustainable. Moving away from this will not be easy, but there are positive signs: China is the second largest manufacturer of solar panels, and was second to Germany as an investor in renewable energy in 2007.<br><strong>Dr Jim Watson</strong><br>Deputy director, Sussex Energy Group, University of Sussex, Brighton</p> <h2>Keep your secret places secret</h2> <p>How absurd to request information about people's favourite secret places ('My favourite wild hideaway', Escape, last week).

  "<p>A London journalist was on holiday in Yorkshire one summer in the early 1890s when he heard talk of a mysterious painting in a nearby mansion. He got the address, walked the 12 miles there and persuaded the under-butler to let him in. Moments later, he was astonished to find himself all alone with Vel\u00e1zquez's Venus at her Mirror, better known as The Rokeby Venus</p> <p>She was hanging in a dingy hall but still the hack knew what he had, reporting that the hairs stood on his neck. On his return to London he rushed to the fine art library at the Victoria and Albert Museum to find out everything he could about the painter, wrote a passionate article about him - practically the first in the British press - and made the arduous pilgrimage to Madrid to see Las Meninas. Within a year, he had published a book on Vel\u00e1zquez and become one of the best art writers in the country. </p> <p>It sounds like a Victorian fable but it is a true romance and, what is more, an experience still to be had today. Not the newspaper scoop, perhaps - although only this year a lost Watteau was found by a sharp-eyed visitor in the proverbial corner of an English country house - but the thrill of the treasure hunt, if you know a work is there to be found, and the sudden revelation if you don't.</p> <p>For how many people actually expect to see the Rembrandt in a remote Welsh castle when it is so little reported? Who knows there are six times as many Zurbar\u00e1ns in a castle in County Durham as at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, unless they live close by? Our path to art is so rarely off the beaten track, channelled as it is through metropolitan museums.</p> <p>But it still possible to stumble upon a masterpiece in a stately home down some pheasant-filled drive. It is still possible to be completely alone with it in a Scottish castle, while everyone else is studying the silver-framed photographs of the last duke welcoming the Reagans. Above all, it is still possible to look at a great work of art in this way - without crowds, without explanatory labels or audio-guides - and for as long as you like: pretty much the ideal viewing conditions for art.</p> <p>And now is the ideal time to do the viewing, now that we can't afford to fly to the Prado and are staying at home this summer. We might be cash-poor but we are time-rich without international travel, and nothing frees the mind so much as having no particular place to go. I never got so much from a Bruegel in my life as the one in that Midlands mansion, Upton House, which I came across on a long, rainy holiday. A black-and-white vision of the last moments of the Virgin, her inner light illuminating the faces of the faithful in the midnight hour, it was hanging among some 17th-century chairs, ignored by the somnolent guards. Anyone could sit down, enter into Bruegel's scene and remain there uninterrupted for hours. </p> <p>Great art deserves time. Great art deserves a pilgrimage, but in Britain the journey may be conveniently short. You are rarely more than 50 odd miles from a masterpiece in these islands.</p> <h2>Artemisia Gentileschi, Self-Portrait as La Pittura, c 1638 <br>Hampton Court , London </h2> <p>Exhibit A in any history of women's art, this is not just the first female self-portrait to become famous, it is also unique among self-portraits in making such a drama of the labour involved. Gentileschi shows herself at an extreme angle, one arm raised to press the brush into the canvas, her body kiltered sideways . It is the hot moment of creation and Gentileschi looks like nobody else in art - or, rather, she looks like an artist of the distant future. She looks like an Action painter.</p> <p>\u00b7 This painting will be included in The Art of Italy exhibition at the Palace of Holyrood House, Edinburgh, 13 November-8 March</p> <h2>El Greco, The Disrobing of Christ, 1579 <br>Upton House, Warwicks </h2> <p>The paintings of El Greco are among the strangest in all art, with their cracking, flickering visions in acid colours, their warped and buckling space. To come across one in the Art Deco surroundings of Upton is especially startling. In this painting, once owned by Delacroix, the air clangs with threat. </p> <h2>Terry Frost, Green, Black and White Movement, 1951 <br>Tate St Ives, Cornwall </h2> <p>Frost was the great survivor of the St Ives movement, painting long after everyone else had died. His sharp, bright discs, lines and wedges are staunchly abstract but spark seascapes in the mind. This lyrical painting from 1951, before his palette turned primary, is a tilting wave of boats in the harbour. You hear what you see: the boats' nautical music.</p> <h2>Kurt Schwitters, Merzbarn wall, 1948 <br>Hatton Gallery, Newcastle </h2> <p>This is the only surviving relic of Schwitters's famous Merzbau series. The great German Dadaist was also Europe's pioneering installation artist, and the Merzbau were monumental collages using discarded objects: walls that were also landscapes of the mind. He only finished one wall of this, his last 'environment' before dying, but it has become a classic of modern art.</p> <h2>John Constable, Sky Study With a Shaft of Sunlight, 1822 <br>Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge </h2> <p>Constable is always better at six inches than six foot. This perfect little study in oil on paper conveys, in a few liquid sweeps, light drizzle, diaphanous cloud and sunshine about to break through above: English sky painting at its best and English weather in a nutshell.</p> <h2>James Turrell, Deer Shelter Skyspace, 2006<br> Yorkshire Sculpture Park </h2> <p>James Turrell, the great light and space artist, has found a stunningly simple way to frame the sky so that you see it in an entirely new light. Converting an 18th-century deer shelter on the Yorkshire hills into a miniature pantheon - a rotunda, with its dome open to the heavens - he turns the sky into an ever-changing image. It is so surprising that even children sit awed beneath this moving picture. It is Turrell's most exciting, yet contemplative, work.</p> <h2>Stanley Spencer, Sandham Memorial Chapel, 1927-32 <br>Burghclere, Hampshire </h2> <p>Inspired by Giotto's Arena Chapel in Padua, Spencer worked on these murals of the Great War for five years. He had signed up as a medical orderly but ended up seeing violent action in Macedonia, and this extraordinary cycle tells the story from bed-making in war hospitals to malarial battlefields.</p> <h2>George Stubbs, Hambletonian Rubbing Down, 1800 <br>Mount Stewart, Northern Ireland </h2> <p>The great racehorse Hambletonian is depicted lifesize, being rubbed down after his win at Newmarket in 1799, a race in which Stubbs felt the horse had been driven too hard. Stubbs was a stupendous anatomist and the anomalies are crucial: it takes two men to contain this magnificent beast, the house dwarfed between its powerful legs.</p> <h2>Sean Scully, Wall of Light Red Day Leaving, 2005 <br>Chatsworth, Derbyshire </h2> <p>Sean Scully makes great art out of modest stripes - vertical, horizontal, gridded, gently abutted in patchworks and mazes. A wall of glowing light, the blocks of deep crimson, orange, ochre and black summon the gradual sinking of the sun.</p> <h2>Paolo Uccello, The Hunt in the Forest, c 1470 <br>Ashmolean Museum, Oxford </h2> <p>Uccello is the mad master of perspective and this is one of the most brilliant examples of its use in Renaissance art. Everyone in the scene - huntsmen in full cry, hounds, horses, deer - is disappearing fast into the depths of the forest. A fence on the right zooms towards the vanishing point as if sucked into a vortex and darkness closes in. This was Uccello's last painting.</p> <h2>Naum Gabo, Linear Construction I, 1942 <br>Pier Arts Centre, Orkney </h2> <p>A highlight of this wonderful gallery in Stromness, Linear Construction No 1 really is a first. It was the first sculpture in which this Russian-born pioneer used nylon filaments to describe form and space, and it had a profound effect on a generation of British sculptors including Barbara Hepworth. Fragile and otherworldly, Linear Construction explores space without depicting mass.</p> <h2>Rembrandt, Catrina Hooghsaet, 1657<br> Penrhyn Castle, Bangor, Wales </h2> <p>Hooghsaet, one of Rembrandt's last patrons, was 50 when she sat for her portrait, the same age as the painter, and there is a sense of directness and equality to the image. A woman of conviction and eager intelligence, she appears vividly present, as if in mid-conversation.</p> <h2>Wyndham Lewis, One of the Stations of the Dead, 1933 <br>Aberdeen Art Gallery</h2> <p>The title and the image of a boat sailing a river through a cave immediately suggest Charon ferrying the souls of the dead into Hades. But the founder of Vorticism, Britain's only home-grown modernist movement, is not just representing myth. Lewis is painting a very modern Hades in 1933, somewhere between the underground and science fiction. </p> <h2>Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n, Levi, c1640<br>Auckland Castle, Bishop Auckland, Durham </h2> <p>The official residence of the Bishop of Durham, Auckland Castle is the unlikely repository of more Zurbar\u00e1ns than any other building in the world: 13 larger-than-life paintings of Jacob and his sons originally made to promote Catholicism in Mexico. The pictures were captured in transit by English pirates and eventually bought by Bishop Trevor in 1756. Zurbar\u00e1n is sometimes called Spain's Caravaggio, but his style is much more reserved and austere. The figures in this series are angular and dark, strange images of Old Testament mores.</p>",
  "<p>Not so very long ago, a woman was lying in bed with her husband and talking. Somehow she didn't notice that he was transcribing her monologue; he recognised the tragicomic potential of her stream of anxious thoughts. When he handed over his notebook, she snorted with laughter, but also felt chastened. Seeing her thoughts written down in black and white gave her a jolt. What kind of loon was she?</p> <p>She was me, and I still have the transcript. </p> <p>My worries that evening covered the following topics: my hair (frizzy, split ends, more grey showing), whether the front door was locked, my eyes (possibility of an eye infection, which could preclude wearing contact lenses, which is to say: disaster), having flat feet (no good with flip-flops, so summer is effectively useless to me), was the front door really locked, the possibility of falling downstairs, my friend Sophie (why she hadn't returned my phone calls). Oh, and are you positive you locked the front door, or should I check?</p> <p>Worrying is something I've always excelled at. In this subject, I'm top of the class, straight As. But it's near impossible for me to get my friends to take my angst seriously. 'Your worries are frankly too ludicrous,' said my friend Eleanor when I called her to talk about this article. </p> <p>It's true. I accept many of my concerns seem unserious. And in public I make light of them, happily casting myself as a kind of female Woody Allen. But when I'm at home those ridiculous concerns can take over. </p> <p>I jump from one to the next without allowing myself a moment's rest. 'As soon as you finish one worry,' says my husband, 'which you usually insist is the worst you've ever had, you immediately start on another.' </p> <p>I'm not a flamboyant worrier; I don't have panic attacks, I don't wail or hyperventilate. Instead, I retreat into my own brain often for hours at a time, stuck either in the past, wishing that something that has happened hadn't (or vice versa), or in the future, overwhelmed by some monstrous circumstance that may never come to be. To my husband, this feels like I'm 'mentally absent'. It's exhausting living inside my head sometimes. It's a hideous waste of time and extremely annoying for those around me. </p> <p>In my last job, on a glossy magazine, the beauty editor encouraged me to have Botox not because I was looking older (though, now I think of it, I worry that this may have been what she was hinting at), but because I looked so anxious all the time. 'I think it'll really change the way people respond to you,' she said brightly. </p> <p>Did people truly think I looked worried? Now I was really worried. But I declined the Botox, because it would have done nothing to address the underlying problem. </p> <p>Anxiety is a bigger problem than this navel-gazing might suggest. Across a spectrum that includes panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress, phobias and the catch-all, generalised anxiety disorder - anxiety disorder has become the most prevalent mental health problem in the world, according to a World Mental Health Survey of 18 countries.</p> <p>And it's about to get worse. We are entering a new age of anxiety. As the economic situation worsens, so fretting in the general population rises. In the past year, oil prices have risen by 50 per cent, basic foods such as rice have soared by as much as 70 per cent and house prices are plummeting at a faster rate than we've seen in a long time. Those in the know are starting to whisper that we're heading for the mother of all recessions.</p> <p>Most people will take little comfort in the fact that the man in charge of all this, Prime Minister Gordon Brown, bites his fingernails. </p> <p>Merryn Somerset Webb, editor of MoneyWeek, has noticed clear signs of anxiety among her readers. 'People are anxious, and they are right to be. They're worrying about investments and pensions, the effect of inflation on their future, about which banks are safe and which might go bust. We have had letters from people who have lost a lot of money on the property market. People under 40 are not used to losing jobs or being made redundant. We are not used to property prices falling or not having what we want. As adults we haven't suffered hardship. I do think a lot of people are in for a big shock.' </p> <p>Economists tell us that what happens in the US will happen to us nine months later. Well, in June it emerged that the American middle classes are losing their homes and finding themselves obliged to live instead in their cars, in specially designated parking lots.</p> <p>City health clinics have reported a huge rise in calls from professionals facing redundancy. A helpline used by London's major banks and financial firms received 3,500 calls in June from people with anxiety and depression - a 10 per cent rise on last year. Project director James Slater says: 'People are worried about redundancies and a potential recession, which adds to people's anxiety, can tip them over the edge.'</p> <p>Don Serratt, a former merchant banker and founder of the Life Works community rehab clinic, has seen a 20 per cent rise since last November in admissions related to economic anxiety. 'We are getting more and more calls from people not just in the City but professionals from all over. Things are bad right now.'</p> <p>Dr Richard Bowskill, consultant psychiatrist at the Priory, is more specific: 'For a while, we have seen people worrying about mortgages and the cost of living. But now we have started to see people worrying about job security. That has a knock-on effect. It leads to people pushing themselves at work. I saw someone this morning who said they couldn't take any more time off work because they felt under scrutiny.</p> <p>'The mind is just another part of the body,' Bowskill explains. 'It's an organ that normally functions well but, if put under too much strain, it starts not functioning properly. The physical symptoms are things like palpitations, stomach churning and sleep disturbance.'</p> <p>Fretting and hand-wringing represent a considerable drain on our time and energy. 'People who worry a lot are generally less effective than those who don't; they get less work done and are often less happy,' says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University. In experimental tasks, worriers are slower to respond than non-worriers, presumably because worrying burns off mental energy that would be more effectively applied elsewhere. 'Worry, it has been said, is often like a rocking chair: it gives you something to do, but it doesn't necessarily get you anywhere. Evolution may have given us the opportunity to worry, but that doesn't mean we should take the bait.'</p> <p>Indeed, constant worry has a clear and scientifically proven link to ill health. Chronic worriers, for example, are more likely than others to suffer from heart conditions. The connection between worry and poor health can also take a less predictable form. Two years ago, I convinced myself I had an eye infection. So I took myself to Moorfields Eye Hospital for checks. It turned out that my eye was perfectly healthy, but sitting in the casualty department among genuine patients, their eyes weeping pus, I picked up an extremely serious viral conjunctivitis that lasted three months and threatened to compromise my sight forever. The lesson: hypochondria really gave me something to worry about. </p> <p>But it seems I've not got it as bad as many others. In the course of researching this story, I bought (and immediately hid inside my bag) a book called Overcoming Anxiety for Dummies. My husband flicked through it before me, and announced with some satisfaction that I didn't seem to have such a bad case after all. For instance I have never felt, like one poor unfortunate in the book, that I was actually going to die during a panic attack.</p> <p>Anxiety, says psychologist Oliver James, is worrying about things you can't do anything about, or which don't matter. It's not the same as fear: fear sharpens the senses, anxiety paralyses them. 'The key thing,' James tells me, 'is that anxiety is irrational. It's a loss of priority - a lost sense of what is <br>important and what isn't.' </p> <p>In my own case, though I am concerned about the environment and the ongoing economic downturn, these are not the things that get me in a funk. I am much less likely to wake in the night in a panic about rising sea levels, or rising fuel bills, than about having a bad haircut. </p> <p>Another way to look at anxiety is as a chemically induced response to threat: the hormone cortisol is secreted, in turn leading to an excess of adrenaline. You go into the fight or the flight mode. 'If your cortisol levels are permanently jammed on high,' explains James, 'you are going to feel permanently under threat. You become indiscriminate about what constitutes a threat. You go to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and worry about running out of tea bags. You become irritable, you swear, you burst into tears. You have very extreme reactions relative to the significance.'</p> <p>The Michelin-starred chef Tom Aikens knows a bit about this. He's well known for an alleged incident with a palette knife that got him fired from his first restaurant. In recent years, he says, he has calmed down a lot thanks to therapy and regular exercise, but at the time - a decade ago - he was 'wound up, stressed', and liable to get upset about silly things. 'I used to bottle everything up and then explode, go off on one. It was always about the little details, because it's the little details that make food special. I would be so stupid. I would be so stressed by an overcooked piece of meat. What's the point? Just put another one on.'</p> <p>According to James, a person's cortisol levels are pretty much set in the first six years of life. If he's right, I can't imagine what might have set my own levels high. I did, years ago, visit a Freudian therapist who gave me a box of hankies and encouraged me to churn up what seemed even to me to be rather petty resentments from the distant past. Rightly or wrongly, I found this approach unhelpful and didn't return. Much more helpful were sessions, a few years later, with a cognitive therapist - who tried to address the way I look at the world and respond to events - though, as must already be clear, she didn't eliminate my problems over the long term.</p> <p>Rather than look back, what matters is whether I am likely to pass on my worrying tendencies to my daughter, now four years old. Although sunny, confident and happy, she has already started registering dissatisfaction with her hair (she has fabulous blonde curls) perhaps because she's witnessed too many of my frizzy-hair freak-outs. I caught her the other day staring into the mirror and stretching out one of her glorious ringlets. Is she destined to be a worrier? Can I stop that? Or will everything I do make it more likely? </p> <p>There's no doubt I've become more anxious since becoming a mother. My fear of falling down stairs only started after my daughter was born; I tortured myself with thoughts of slipping while carrying my precious bundle. My hypochondria also intensified, and I became scared of swimming in the sea (I put these down to the post-natal realisation that another human really depends on me to remain alive, and healthy). </p> <p>But these protective concerns can themselves produce negative effects. In spring last year, after Madeleine McCann disappeared, I became deeply anxious about my daughter's safety and let her come into our bed at night. I liked having her next to me, just to hear her breathing, and knowing she was all right. The result: she developed a fear of sleeping in her own room and it took us most of the autumn to coax her back into her own bed. </p> <p>The American author and academic Katie Roiphe recognises high levels of anxiety in herself and believes that passing it on to Violet, her six-year-old daughter, is inevitable. 'I think it's impossible not to pass along that temperament,' she says. 'When I was a child I was afraid of the wind - even when I was six months old, I was that afraid of the universe. It's impossible that I should get a calm child. I look at some children who are unflappable and think that would be nice for my daughter, but I don't think it's going to happen. My daughter worries about a million things: that if she is going to drink from someone else's straw she will turn into that person. She has supernatural worries.' </p> <p>But can anxiety really be explained entirely by the influence of neurotic parents, or high levels of cortisol laid down in childhood? The sudden, recent increase in anxiety among adults stressing about climate change and economic collapse suggests not. Could it be caused by consumerism, which we grow into more slowly?</p> <p>It could, says Tom Hodgkinson, editor of The Idler and author of the inspirational How to Be Free. He believes that our economic system functions precisely by keeping us anxious. We're encouraged to believe, at all times, that we're just one purchase away from happiness: 'Anxious people make good consumers and good workers. Anxiety will drive us back into our comfort blankets of credit-card shopping and bad food - the system deliberately produces anxiety while simultaneously promising to take it away.' </p> <p>The writer and professional worrier William Leith agrees. He breaks off from writing a new book, Bits of Me are Falling Apart, to elaborate: 'Gordon Brown is always telling us that our economy has to grow, otherwise we will fall apart. What does that mean? It means that everyone has to make you buy stuff all the time. And the way they do this is by constantly advertising. Advertising is about making you feel anxious: you're too fat, or you need a new kitchen. We live in a world where you can be playing golf and, on finally putting the ball, you find inside the hole an ad for a car. You walk away thinking, \"I should buy a Lexus.\"'</p> <p>Oliver James makes a similar case in his book Affluenza. And if we're anxious in the good times, economic downturn will be so much worse. Since the advent of the credit crunch, he argues, significant numbers of people will have been 'shitting themselves'. Their cortisol levels, he contends, will be through the ceiling. 'They will be worrying themselves silly and will become physically ill. They might start showing OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) symptoms, trying to create something safe out of this very dangerous situation. They might think: \"If I say 100 Hail Marys before leaving the house at least there is something I can do.\"'</p> <p>If that's what they're doing, I can sympathise. At times of particular stress (or, as my husband would tell you, every night), I find myself compelled to check the front door several times. I also have a little routine for checking the cooker is turned off. I blame my husband for this: he has occasionally forgotten to turn off the gas, and if he's cavalier about the cooker then how can I be sure about the front door? But I daresay that James would point to other, deeper reasons for my obsessive checking.</p> <p>Leith believes that obsessive compulsive behaviour masks deeper anxieties. 'If I am worried about a big thing like, \"I'm a complete failure, half my life has gone and I'm going to be dead soon\", the incidental worries get worse. If I'm sitting at my desk to start writing, I might think, \"Oh, God, I can't write, I just can't do it, I just can't do it. Oh, God.\" At those times, I might need to check the cooker in case the house is burning down.'</p> <p>Despite holding consumerism responsible, James believes that therapy can help. He particularly recommends something called the Hoffman Process, which he himself has undergone. But this seems to involve whacking cushions and pretending they are your parents, and to me it sounds horribly like the Freudian analyst I saw years ago - but worse, and more expensive. </p> <p>Hodgkinson, more appealingly, encourages us to take matters into our own hands and simply shed the burden - 'the dreadful, gnawing, stomach-churning sense that things are awry, mixed with a chronic sense of powerlessness ... forever hoping, fearing or regretting'. </p> <p>In How to Be Free, Hodgkinson sets out a comprehensive list of methods to encompass this liberation. These include gardening, ceasing to read newspapers or watch telly, and embracing a fatalistic theology. 'Catholics are probably less anxious than Protestants,' Hodgkinson argues. 'Buddhists are certainly less anxious than Jews.'</p> <p>My husband has similar ideas. He frequently urges me to read the works of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk and best-selling self-help master. Once in a while, I give it a go. The general thrust seems to be that we should learn to live in the moment, by for instance concentrating on our breath. 'Mindful breathing helps us stop being preoccupied by sorrows of the past and anxieties of the future,' Nhat Hanh writes in one book. 'It helps us be in touch with life in the present moment.'</p> <p>But worry creeps up on us even when we're counting our breaths and living in the moment. It's Leith, typically downbeat, who points this out to me. It happens, for instance, when he's negotiating pedestrian crossings with his three-year-old son: 'Before you cross,' he says, 'you wait for the green man. But what if there's no traffic coming? Should I stick to my guns and wait? Or should I cross the road? If so, surely he will realise that this is an exception? But then again, I want him to understand it has to turn green before he even thinks of crossing. I don't want him to think there's an either/or. Am I being over-anxious? There may be an appropriate level of anxiety, but no one knows what it is.'</p>",
  "<h2>Seek inspiration</h2> <p>If your garden is feeling in-betweeny, steal some planting ideas from one of the many gardens that are at their very best in August - Forde Abbey in Somerset (<a href=\"http://www.fordeabbey.co.uk\">fordeabbey.co.uk</a>; 01460 220 231), the Garden House in Devon (<a href=\"http://www.thegardenhouse.org.uk\">thegardenhouse.org.uk</a>; 01822 854 769), Coughton Court in Warwickshire (<a href=\"http://www.coughtoncourt.co.uk\">coughtoncourt.co.uk</a>; 01789 400 777), or Scampston Hall in North Yorkshire (<a href=\"http://www.scampston.co.uk\">scampston.co.uk</a>; 01944 759 111).</p> <p>Forget the largeness of scale, and concentrate on particular plant combinations you can copy, or desirable plants that might be squeezed into an existing scheme, like the unusual herbaceous clematis, C heracleifolia, which grows like a bush rather than climbs, and bears whorls of pale blue scented flowers. The Garden House, with its magnificent collection of South African bulbs, is a revelation: our brash crocosmias and red hot pokers turn out to have so many elegant and easy-to-grow cousins. If visiting Forde Abbey, leave plenty of space in the boot: attached to the garden is an irresistible small nursery specialising in herbaceous perennials. </p> <h2>Install an automatic irrigation system</h2> <p>That way you don't have to rely on neighbours every time you want to go away - and if the Indian summer does come, you're quids in! The Tropf Blumat drip-feed system is not cheap, at \u00a360.90, but is discreet and extremely water-efficient, and will keep 12 hanging baskets or tubs or four growbags permanently supplied from a tap or raised water tank. Ceramic probes inserted in the soil act as sensors so that water is delivered only when the soil is dry - much more efficient than a system based on an automated timer, and greener, too, as no electricity is required. Alternatively, you can buy the components to tailor-make your own system, supplying up to 500 probes - enough to keep even the most elaborate container garden in fine fettle. You can order online from Two Wests &amp; Elliott (<a href=\"http://www.twowests.co.uk\">twowests.co.uk</a>; 01246 451 077).</p> <h2>Plant a blueberry</h2> <p>Blueberries seem to be imbued with almost magical properties, reputed to ward off cancer, improve your circulation, sharpen your eyesight and even your memory. They are easy to grow in containers in ericaceous compost: order some now and this time next year you could be munching your very own crop of superfruit and glowing with health. For the best crop, buy at least two plants of different varieties: the Dorset Blueberry Company (<a href=\"http://www.dorset-blueberry.com\">dorset-blueberry.com</a>; 01202 891 426), has the widest choice of varieties and a website which is a fund of advice on all things blue and berryish. Thompson and Morgan (<a href=\"http://www.thompson-morgan.com\">thompson-morgan.com</a>; 01473 695 200) is offering a collection of three plants, cropping throughout the season, for \u00a329.99 plus p&amp;p, while Suttons (<a href=\"http://www.suttons.co.uk\">suttons.co.uk</a>; 0844 922 2899) has one plant each of early cropping 'Earliblue' and mid-season 'Bluecrop' for \u00a321.95 plus p&amp;p. If these prices seem a little bruising, consider that a single punnet of imported blueberries costs \u00a32.99 - and that's not counting the airmiles. </p> <h2>Prune your wisteria</h2> <p>There are certain garden operations that set 'real gardeners' apart from wannabes - like growing perfect cucumbers, or knowing how and when to prune wisteria. The time to prune is now, so let's take our courage in our hands: armed with pruning bible, The Gardening Which? Guide to Pruning, surely we can't go far wrong. The aim of pruning is to concentrate the plant's energies into flowering, so August's task is to cut away excess leafy growth to encourage more new buds to grow next year. The first step is to tie in any new shoots needed to extend the framework of the plant. Then return to the main framework and cut away all the young whip-like growth to around six inches (15cm) long, leaving five to seven leaves on each shoot. This will improve air circulation and allow in more sunlight to ripen the younger stems. Then water the plant well, and put the secateurs away till February. At that time we will need to shorten the summer-pruned shoots again, to leave just two or three flower buds on each - by then it should be easy to distinguish fat flower buds from slim growth buds. </p> <h2>Snip happy</h2> <p>Now we've got the hang of it, all sorts of things benefit from summer pruning. Cistus may be looking a bit straggly, and will produce more flowers next year if this year's flowering shoots are cut back. The same goes for Convulvulus cneorum - a trim now will ensure a fresh supply of those gorgeous silvery leaves. In both cases, pick out the shoots that have flowered and cut back to a point about two thirds down from the tip, making your cut just above a bud. A light trim every year is the way to keep these bushes in shape, but be careful not to snip into the old wood, as they will not regenerate from there. </p> <h2>Do some daydreaming</h2> <p>Long, balmy summer evenings are the ideal time to wander, glass in hand, full of visions of the perfect garden. As the shadows lengthen, the colours start to glow - the very best time to experiment with new colour combinations with the old gardener's trick of picking a bloom and wiring it to a stick so you can try out a variety of potential homes. August is a good time to think about more radical projects, too, like creating a new bed or border. If you plan it now, you will have time to prepare the site while the evenings are still long and before it gets too wet, and have it ready for the optimum planting time of mid-autumn. </p> <h2>Chop back stragglers</h2> <p>It's always tricky judging the moment to chop back hardy geraniums, Alchemilla and Nepeta. But once the Alchemilla is browning, the catmint faded and the geranium straggly, there's no point waiting any longer. Cutting back to a neat little mound of new young leaves will feel a positive relief. </p> <h2>Feast your eyes on veg</h2> <p>If you already have a veg garden, you will be in a frenzy of picking, blanching, freezing and bottling. If not, think how delightful, healthy and satisfying it would feel to be harvesting your own tomatoes and courgettes, beans and salads, cauliflowers and beetroot (OK, maybe not beetroot); even, space permitting, onions and spuds. There's no denying that growing your own veg is a lot of work, but work with spade and hoe is the perfect antidote to brain work, and beats going to the gym. Before you have a go, visit Anglesey Abbey in Cambridgeshire, Calke Abbey in Derbyshire or Llanerchaeron, near Aberaeron, in Wales - an inspirational walled garden staffed entirely by volunteers (visit <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org\">nationaltrust.org</a> for opening times and prices.) Organic gardeners will find a wealth of practical tips at Audley End in Essex (<a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/audleyend\">english-heritage.org.uk/audleyend</a>) and the Go Organic garden at Ryton, near Coventry (<a href=\"http://www.gardenorganic.org.uk\">gardenorganic.org.uk</a>). At Barnsley House in Gloucestershire, the late Rosemary Verey, one of the grandes dames of 20th-century gardening, made a tiny but perfectly formed potager that must be the most photographed vegetable plot in history. Barnsley House is now a hotel, but the garden opens to the public just five days a year. The last this year is on August 21, 11am-5pm (<a href=\"http://www.ngs.org.uk\">ngs.org.uk</a>; 01285 740 000).</p> <h2>Sow salads</h2> <p>Suitably inspired, you can begin by sowing a range of delicious salads to see you through autumn into winter: rocket, spinach, lamb's lettuce, curly endive, mizuna and all the Oriental greens. Rocket, in particular, tends to bolt in hot conditions, and will grow much better as the days grow longer. It is still worth making late-season sowings of carrots, radishes and spring onions, and you can also sow cabbages, onions and peas for spring, protecting them from the worst of the winter weather with polythene cloches. </p> <h2>Take cuttings</h2> <p>In these parsimonious times, making plants for free seems a remarkably good idea - you can sell or swap any surplus. There's still time to take cuttings from a wide range of woody plants: herbs like thyme, sage and rosemary, climbers like honeysuckle and passionflower, shrubs like choisya and fuchsias, as well as herbaceous perennials like germander (Teucrium) and penstemons. Select shoots that have not flowered, are soft at the tip but starting to firm up at the base; traditionally, cuttings are taken 10-15cm long, but longer cuttings are just as viable. Trim to just below a leaf node, remove the soft tip and the lower leaves and reduce the leaf size if large. Dip the base in rooting hormone, then insert into a 50/50 mixture of compost and vermiculite. Place in a cool greenhouse or frame, and don't let the compost dry out. You're in business when you see growth at the tips.</p> <h2>Collect seed of poppies</h2> <p>In similar vein, collect ripe seed from Oriental poppies (Papaver orientale) - shake the seeds into a paper bag if you don't want to snap off the pretty seedheads - and hang them to dry in a breezy spot or in the airing cupboard. As soon as they are dry sow into a seedbed, then transfer to their final positions in October or April. They will flower the following year. </p> <h2>Cut old canes of Summer raspberries</h2> <p>Cut the old canes close to the ground and thin out new canes. Leave no more than half a dozen strong stems growing from each original plant, and tie them in to their wires. </p> <h2>Trim your topiary</h2> <p>The traditional time to clip box hedges is Derby Day, during the first week in June; followed, ideally, by a second trim in September. That's a good system if you have time - or staff - to spare. But if you have a lot to get through, or if your time is limited, you can manage perfectly well by trimming once a year in late summer. By cutting now you will maintain a sharp outline for the longest possible stretch before growth recommences next May. To see topiary at its finest, visit Levens Hall near Kendal in Cumbria (<a href=\"http://www.levenshall.co.uk\">levenshall.co.uk</a>; 01539 560 321). If you go today, you will also enjoy the first ever Chilli Fest in the north of England - a mad juxtaposition that is typical of this gloriously quixotic garden. </p> <h2>Prune apple and pear cordons</h2> <p>While bush trees don't need summer pruning, apples and pears trained as cordons, espaliers and stepovers need attention in the summer to keep them in shape. Examine the new shoots that have appeared over the summer - the time to prune is when the bottom third has turned brown and they are getting woody at the base (pears are usually ready before apples). If the shoot is growing directly from the stem, cut it back to the third leaf above the basal cluster of leaves. If it is growing from the stub left by previous pruning, trim back to just one leaf above the basal cluster. Any upright, over-vigorous shoots should be removed altogether. </p> <h2>Mollycoddle your agapanthus</h2> <p>Billowing pots of bright blue agapanthus (African lily) are one of the highlights of the August garden. There is a widespread belief that agapanthus need to be potbound and starved in order to flower well. Alas, poor things, they don't like it any more than you would. Instead, feed them fortnightly during the growing season with a dilute high-potash feed such as Tomorite, and watch them grow fat and happy. To see agapanthus growing in breathtaking magnificence, you can visit the National Collection at Pine Cottage Plants in Devon (<a href=\"http://www.pcplants.co.uk\">pcplants.co.uk</a>; 01769 580 076) on Mondays to Saturdays (10am-4pm) throughout August. Look out for a superb new cultivar, 'Northern Star', which is a swooningly dark blue. Previous dark cultivars have been evergreen, and therefore slightly tender, but deciduous 'Northern Star' is guaranteed to be hardy. </p> <h2>Get busy with bulbs</h2> <p>There's just time to order some gorgeous autumn flowering bulbs, such as Acis autumnalis (formerly Leucojum autumnale), with white bells on slender stalks, cheerful autumn crocus C speciosus, and Colchichum autumnale, whose delicate rosy flowers appearing on leafless stalks in October lend it the name of 'Naked Ladies'. To cheer you through the winter, plant some cyclamen - choose varieties that give you beautiful leaves as well as flowers, such as C coum 'Silver Leaf'. Finally, Madonna lilies (Lilium candidum) and the curious black and green widow iris can go in now for next year. The iris, now correctly (if unpoetically) classified as Hermodactylus tuberosus, is far from reliable, but the colouring is so striking, and the prospect of flowers on a bleak February day so alluring, that it is worth persevering (<a href=\"http://www.avonbulbs.co.uk\">avonbulbs.co.uk</a>; 01460 242 177). </p> <h2>Get browsing</h2> <p>If you are thinking of planting a tree, now is the time to be looking at nursery catalogues from the comfort of your deckchair - the more unusual varieties tend to sell out first. Then it is time to start planning your spring and summer bulb order for autumn planting (yes - more bulbs!). One good effect of climate change is that many bulbs previously considered tender can now be grown successfully outside, given a warm sheltered spot and - most important - really good winter drainage. New this year from Van Tubergen (<a href=\"http://www.vantubergen.co.uk\">vantubergen.co.uk</a>; 01379 688 282) is the wonderfully exotic 'Firecracker flower', Dichelostemma ida-maia. It flowers from May to July, bearing red tubular bells with a dinky green fringe round the base of each one. Native of Oregon, where it endures occasional frosts, it needs to be planted about 3in deep in a gritty, free-draining soil: the base of a sunny wall would be ideal. A hot, dry spot will also suit the explosive Allium schubertii, an extrovert from Israel with enormous starbursts of flower up to 40cm across in June. From Avon Bulbs (www.avonbulbs. co.uk; 01460 242 177), Triteleia peduncularis just has the edge among four exquisite new triteleias - all reliably hardy, with long-lasting, star-shaped flowers. And if you like the green-striped viridiflora tulips, how can you resist 'Flaming Spring Green' a new form of Tulipa 'Spring Green', with petals teasingly streaked with red? Next, if your wallet can take the battering, you can move on to ordering perennials for planting in autumn. The cheery catalogue from Hayloft Plants (<a href=\"http://www.hayloft-plants.co.uk\">hayloft-plants.co.uk</a>; 01386 562 999) is an excellent place to start, sensibly arranged into categories like sun- and shade-lovers, long-flowering, drought-tolerant, pest tolerant, and so on. </p> <h2>Read for pleasure</h2> <p>Don't get up from that deckchair. There's more to garden reading than manuals and catalogues. Michael Pollan's Second Nature will make you laugh; Katherine Swift's The Morville Hours will make you cry. Both will teach you more about gardening than any how-to book. And if you have never come across the quarterly gardening journal Hortus, seek it out. Hortus is 21 years old this year, and a special birthday collection, Hortus Revisited, selects highlights from this treasure trove of hugely entertaining, occasionally eccentric, always erudite garden writing. Edited by David Wheeler and published by Frances Lincoln, it is available from <a href=\"http://www.hortus.co.uk\">hortus.co.uk</a> for \u00a320, including p&amp;p.</p> <h2>Plant a Salvia</h2> <p>It's odd how fashionable Salvia nemorosa appears at Chelsea year after year, while the much more colourful and long-flowering shrubby salvias are curiously underused. Try electric blue S guaranitica 'Blue Enigma', ruby-red pineapple sage (S elegans), with its fruitily scented leaves, or lipstick-pink S involucrata 'Mulberry Jam'. All have an intensity of colour that is almost luminous, and will last through to the first frosts. </p> <h2>Grab a free special plant</h2> <p>Special Plants in Wiltshire (<a href=\"http://www.specialplants.net\">specialplants.net</a>; 01225 891 686) is a quite remarkable nursery, stuffed with rare and unusual plants, many introduced to this country by proprietor Derry Watkins. This summer it is celebrating 10 years of opening for the National Gardens Scheme by giving every visitor a free birthday gift. The next NGS opening is at 11am on August 21: form an orderly queue.</p>",
  "<p>I grew up on an estate in the north of Glasgow, a place called Bishopbriggs. It was a slightly over-planned Sixties-built concept estate; basically a load of Wimpey houses on a few fancy little streets with slightly avant-garde names like Lyne Croft and Bowmont Hill. </p> <p>It was down Bowmont Hill that my idyllic childhood collided with Glaswegian reality. It was the height of the summer holidays and the kids on the estate ended up playing together in the street. The craze that summer was for home-made ice lollies. It seemed every freezer in every house contained moulds filled with any variety of frozen concoction. All the kids would pile back to each other's houses to try the latest home-made blend. I recall being rather taken with a milk and Coke version. Then one day, we ended up heading into the garden of some random child. There must have been 11 or 12 of us. We were met at the garden gate by his mum who allowed every child in, every child with the exception of me. She looked at me pointedly.</p> <p>'Youse can all come in ... but not him ... '</p> <p>It was clear that I was not welcome. I stood on the pavement, numb, watching the backs of my friends as they disappeared into the garden and left me on my own. I had no idea why I had been singled out. I was upset and ran home. My mum knew exactly why I had been ostracised.</p> <p>'Don't worry,' she told me. 'This is life; what can you do? It is not our job to rock the boat.'</p> <p>As I got older I would be asked time and again where home was and they would laugh when I suggested Glasgow. Implicit in all of their interrogations was the accusation that I did not belong, that I was other, that my home was not here. To them I could never be Scottish.</p> <p>But then again, my India was just a version of India as defined through a childhood in Glasgow. Sunday was our day to be Indian. My mother would wrangle her three sons into smart clothes before tramping our dad and us off to gurdwara, the Sikh temple. At the end of the religious service the holy men would hand out prasad. If you ever needed convincing that the universe has some form of higher power at its helm, then prasad would be the single substance to convert you. It's a semolina- and sugar based concoction bound together with ghee. It is bereft of any nutritional value, but it is hot and sweet and lovely. After prasad we would enjoy langar.</p> <p>Every temple is compelled to offer any comer a free hot meal. You can be the wealthiest man in Punjab or the lowliest cowherd, but together you sit and share the same delicious meal, cooked in the temple by devotees. This is langar. I was meant to be born a Sikh: generosity and food, my two favourite things. </p> <p>My mother is an amazing cook, so good that I have stopped cooking Indian food myself. However, there is a place in Southall, in the Sikh ghetto west of London, where the food comes pretty close to my mum's. The New Asian Tandoori Centre is the only Indian restaurant I will ever take my parents to in Britain. I have often piled my family into the car and driven 45 minutes to devour their food.</p> <p>On one such day when I was planning my trip to India I realised that so much of contemporary Britain is based around Indian food - there I was in a place originally designed to feed immigrants from the Punjab who had come to drive buses, sweep streets and staff Heathrow airport, and the joint was full of every sort of person - black, white and everything in between, joining the massed ranks of Indians. The common theme seemed to be that we were all British. Food unites. An idea was born. I have always thought that my ability to cook allows me to share a little of my soul with my guests and in my repertoire I have a number of powerful British dishes - roast lamb, beef, pork and chicken. It is food I hope will make me friends across India, although I would have to be canny about where I cook pork and beef. So I mentioned my idea to my dad. He likes my cooking; he calls me Masterchef. However, he was less than impressed by my new plan.</p> <p>'So, Dad, I'm going to cook British food in India when I am travelling.' </p> <p>Silence on the Glasgow end of the phone. </p> <p>'Dad?'</p> <p>He pauses. 'Son, if British food was all that good then there would be no Indian restaurants in Britain.'</p> <h2>Three Indians I would take my Mum to</h2> <p><strong>Lahore Kebab House</strong><br>2-10 Umberston Street, London E1, 020 7481 9737</p> <p>Step off the East End street and into the lap of Lahore. The welcome is as warm as the parathas and the place is a constant bustle of hustle, with rarely an empty table. Continuing the historic traditions of their Moghul heritage, dishes such as raan - leg of lamb cooked overnight - and haleem - a shredded chicken and lentil dish - are favourites on the menu. </p> <p><strong>Mother India's Cafe</strong><br>1355 Argyle Street, Glasgow, 0141 339 9145</p> <p>This is where my parents would take me for dinner. Only open a few years, it's already a celebrated institution among my Glaswegian curryphile brethren. The Cafe's USP is its tapas approach - diners are encouraged to order three or four smaller plates of food. And what food! Lamb padina is a family favourite, and there is always a weekly special or two. </p> <p><strong>New Asian Tandoori Centre</strong><br>114-116 The Green, Southall, 020 8574 2597</p> <p>It's fairly basic, but this offers the gamut of North Indian food; delicious daals and venerable vegetables. And the meat! Once you've allowed their deep and earthy lamb curry to melt in your mouth you feel as if you are a five-year-old back in your mum's kitchen. It's Punjabi food heaven.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hardeep Singh Kohli's Indian Takeaway: One Man's Attempt to Cook his Way Home is published by Canongate on 4 Sept, \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "<p>Forty years ago this week, the night sky above Prague began to rumble with the sound of transport aircraft. On distant frontiers, tanks lurched forward. The invasion of Czechoslovakia had begun.</p> <p>Today, there are Russian tank columns driving along Georgian roads. Again, a small country lies prostrate before the military power of the Kremlin. Poland, in turn, is informed by a Russian general that by agreeing to station American missiles, it has made itself a nuclear target - perhaps no more than a brutal statement of the obvious.</p> <p>But there are big differences between now and 1968. First, the Georgians fought back before being overwhelmed, something they will remember in the years to come. Second, this is something less than total occupation. Anything may still happen, but this Russian action looks more like a punitive expedition.</p> <p>What do the Russians want? The world does not yet know. Possibly the Russians do not know either; their tradition is to enter a crisis with several contrary game plans and then to play it by ear. But some short-term purposes are already clear.</p> <p>They want to destroy Georgia's military hardware so thoroughly it will take a decade to rebuild. That is what the roving armoured units are doing. They want to upgrade their 'peacekeeping' forces in South Ossetia and Abkhazia so Georgia will never dare to attack across their borders again. They want to discredit President Mikheil Saakashvili so utterly that the Georgian people will depose him. They want to show the world the sort of price which would be paid for taking Georgia into Nato and also to suggest that Georgia is too erratic to be a Nato partner.</p> <p>But Russia may also have plans for a new relationship with Georgia. While Condoleezza Rice and other Western leaders try to implement the cease-fire, President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin would like to get rid of all these international mediators, above all the Americans. They would almost certainly prefer to impose on defeated Georgia a new bilateral treaty with the Russian Federation. Any such treaty may well include returning to Russia one or more of the military bases in Georgia which they reluctantly evacuated a few years ago.</p> <p>By this weekend, Russian forces had ceased to shoot but Georgia's agony continued. Much more terrible than the soldiers are the civilians who come behind them, big-bellied men with machine pistols wearing army jackets thrown over T-shirts. They are doing the murdering, looting and burning, as they drive the last Georgians out of South Ossetia. Now they can reach Georgian territory as far as Gori, so they are following and killing them there.</p> <p>They are Ossetians, helped by Chechen volunteers and by ultra-patriotic Russian 'Cossacks'. A year ago, most of these Ossetians probably lived in neighbourly peace with the local Georgians in the next village. But the spark of war ignites madness. The neighbours became traitors, spies, saboteurs, snipers.</p> <p>These gunmen are Ossetians, but if Saakashvili's surprise attack had succeeded, the killers would be Georgians and the victims Ossetians. The first outrush of Ossetian refugees from the fighting in Tskhinvali reported that Georgian atrocities against them had already started.</p> <p>Now the outrush is Georgian. They will become helpless, homeless IDPs - internal displaced persons - crowded into dirty huts and abandoned factories with thousands of older IDPs who have been rotting on the fringe of Georgian society for 15 years.</p> <p>For all this has happened before.</p> <p>That is the worst thing about the tragic war over South Ossetia. The impetuous Georgian resort to force, the appeal to Russian armed strength giving Russia a chance to weaken Georgia's independence, the terrible crimes carried out by civilians of the winning side against the helpless families of the losing side, the ethnic cleansing, the refugees - all these horrors happened here only 15 years ago.</p> <p>The trouble in Abkhazia began when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Georgia moved to full independence, asserting that Abkhazia was part of its territory. The Abkhazians retorted that association with Georgia within the Soviet framework had been one thing; downgrading to an ethnic minority directly and exclusively ruled from Tbilisi was quite another. Agitation began.</p> <p>Then in August 1992, the Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze suddenly flung the army against Abkhazia. Like Saakashvili, he tried to reassert control by bombarding and seizing the capital, Sokhumi. Violent fighting broke out. In the war that followed, Russian weaponry and air strikes helped little Abkhazia - with less than a tenth of Georgia's population - to an unexpected victory.</p> <p>When it was over, Abkhazia's towns and villages lay in ruins. And atrocities had followed the fighting troops. At first, it was the Georgian militias who did their worst against non-Georgian civilians. But then, as the war turned their way, Abkhazian paramilitaries and the wild north Caucasus volunteers who had swarmed in to help them took indiscriminate vengeance. Almost the entire Georgian and Mingrelian population, some 150,000, fled with the Georgian army. Many of them live in bleak refugee settlements to this day.</p> <p>The point of this history is that nobody learnt anything from it, nobody except the Russians. So history has repeated itself. In the years that followed, Georgian politicians failed to see that only imaginative diplomacy, not bombardment by rockets, might bring about some kind of rapprochement with South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>The Abkhazians, independent but recognised by nobody, have no choice but to accept unofficial Russian hegemony. But at heart they resent it. They dream of escaping into the big world and genuine independence. Saakashvili, when he came to power, could have exploited that resentment by making a fresh start with Abkhazia. A few gestures and proposals were made. But the Abkhazian leaders, grimly suspicious, rejected them all as eyewash. Saakashvili, they insisted, was a nationalist demagogue who intended to recapture both Abkhazia and smaller South Ossetia by force. Today they are entitled to say: 'We told you so.'</p> <p>It's time the West stopped talking about 'Georgian territorial integrity', and about South Ossetia and Abkhazia as 'breakaway regions of Georgia', as if their 'illegal secession' can somehow be reversed. It cannot. That useless dream is dead. The question now is quite different. It is how their independence can be recognised and made real. Only in that way can the outside world make it harder for Russia to use them as pawns in the game of crippling Georgian freedom.</p> <p>It may not be possible to rescue South Ossetia, tiny and without resources, from becoming a Russian protectorate or even part of the Russian Federation - and most of its people seem to want that. But Abkhazia, with its once-flourishing holiday coast and rich agriculture, can be a perfectly viable Black Sea state. The European Union has a Black Sea neighbourhood programme. It's time for the EU to stop pretending that Abkhazia does not exist, to integrate it into the programme and to give it vigorous help.</p> <p>And Georgia, that miraculous little nation which contains some of the world's most talented people, and some of its worst politicians, must change. It is not Georgia which has been defeated, but a particular Georgian policy which has again and again played into Russian hands.</p> <p>We know now that Russia's revival as a big power is under way. Outside competition for influence over the ex-Soviet nations is going to be fiercely resisted. After Georgia comes Ukraine, where attempts to join Nato could end by splitting the nation and, with the Russian fleet still based in Crimea, bring about a terrifying confrontation.</p> <p>Nato, with the Americans, can protect its own members against blackmail by standing firm. But the brutal truth is that if Nato is to survive, it must not sign up nations for which at heart it is not prepared to fight. The best way to prevent war is not windy condemnation, but clear, credible rules of engagement. Bluffing can be fatal.</p>",
  "<h2>Letter of the week</h2> <p>I'm a bereft greyhound racing fan who, with yesterday's closure of Walthamstow Stadium, faces a much longer journey to Wimbledon. I've been considering trips to other classic stadiums but my wife, not unreasonably, is unwilling to undertake a long trip just for a night at the dogs. Where can we combine the racing, an upmarket hotel and good shopping?<br><strong>Alan Stones, east London</strong></p> <p>Try Leeds. Train fares from London start at \u00a38 each way second class, \u00a314 first class at <a href=\"http://www.nationalexpresseastcoast.co.uk\">nationalexpresseastcoast.co.uk</a>. In Leeds check into Quebecs (0113 244 8989; <a href=\"http://www.theetoncollection.com\">theetoncollection.com</a>), across City Square from the station. It has shopping weekend packages at \u00a3195 per night for a de luxe double, including breakfast, champagne and chocolates on arrival and a discount card for the upmarket Victoria Quarter shopping arcades. Hop on a Sheffield or Doncaster-bound Metro train stopping at Fitzwilliam. A short walk from the station is Kinsley greyhound stadium (01977 625124; <a href=\"http://www.kinsleydogs.co.uk\">kinsleydogs.co.uk</a>), with races on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Entry is \u00a35.60. You could also go to Brighton: stay at the rock'n'roll-themed Hotel Pelirocco (01273 327055; <a href=\"http://www.hotelpelirocco.co.uk\">hotelpelirocco.co.uk</a>) then head out to the Brighton &amp; Hove stadium races, pictured above (see <a href=\"http://www.brightonandhovegreyhoundstadium.co.uk\">brightonandhovegreyhoundstadium.co.uk</a>).</p> <p><strong>Q </strong>I am renting, with friends, an apartment in Venice for a week in October. As a week is quite a long time for a city break and I'm more of a modernist when it comes to architecture and art, can you suggest where else we might visit using public transport for day trips? It's difficult to tell which places are easy to reach and what we might see.<br><strong>Carol Green, Oxford</strong></p> <p>Don't discount Venice entirely. Its modernist architecture is limited, but there are a few pieces scattered around the city. The work of Venetian-born Carlo Scarpa can be seen at the Olivetti Showroom in Piazza San Marco and the entrance to the Institute of Venetian Architecture in Campo Tolentini in the Santa Croce district. The pavilions at the end of the Giardini Pubblici in the Castello district are also worth a nose around, even if you're not there at Biennale time. Scarpa also designed several museum interiors in Venice - the Palazzo Querini-Stampalia in Castell, for example. For trips outside the city there are plenty of interesting options within reach. The Banca Popolare di Verona, in the city of the same name, is another fine piece of work by the same architect. Many destinations near Venice have an older core with more modern touches, such as Verona, Vicenza and Treviso, but you may find the noted fascist-era and other 20th-century architecture of Brescia an interesting detour. It's an easy one-hour 45-minute train ride from Venice. Train times are available at <a href=\"http://www.trenitalia.it\">trenitalia.it</a>. You'll find plenty of modern art in Venice - the Peggy Guggenheim Collection and the Gallery of Modern Art inside the Ca' Pesaro are the best places to start. </p> <p><strong>Q </strong>My wife and I have decided on a round-the-world trip from January to March next year, initially overnighting in Singapore before flying to Cairns then on to Sydney, where we will pick up a hire car. Our plan is to drive to Melbourne and Adelaide over three weeks. Can you advise where we can obtain a directory of motels or equivalent accommodation along the route? On completion of this route, we have short stays in the Red Centre before visiting NZ, Fiji and finally San Francisco. Will we require anti-malarial tablets at any stage of our trip?<br><strong>S J Perry, Battle, East Sussex</strong></p> <p>Your handwritten letter gave me pause for thought as to whether you have internet access, which would make planning such a trip a doddle. In particular, the websites of individual Australian states you're passing through (<a href=\"http://www.visitnsw.com\">visitnsw.com</a>; <a href=\"http://www.visitvictoria.com\">visitvictoria.com</a>; <a href=\"http://www.southaustralia.com\">southaustralia.com</a>) have detailed accommodation listings, searchable by categories and destinations. Brochures are also downloadable, but printed versions can only be sent within Australia. </p> <p>Without the web, extensive planning will mean getting hold of a guidebook. January is summer holiday time and there's plenty of demand from local and international tourists, so making arrangements at least for the first few nights is a good idea. </p> <p>There's no need for anti-malarials for any destinations you're visiting, but it's a good idea to get other jabs and vaccinations up to date, including hepatitis A, tetanus, typhoid, polio and possibly rabies. Talk to your GP or travel clinic. </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> A friend of mine was recently stopped from boarding a plane because her son had his wrist in a cast. They had checked in - the person on the check-in desk didn't notice because it was under the sleeve of his jumper - and they weren't trying to hide it, because they didn't realise it would be a problem. At the gate, one of the crew spotted it and would not allow him to board the plane. According to him, it is illegal to board an aircraft with a cast without a doctor's certificate of fitness to fly. Is this right?<br><strong>Victoria Cox, London</strong></p> <p>It depends on the airline. There is no legal requirement to have a doctor's note if you wear a cast; the only rule is that it must have been in place for more than 48 hours. Some airlines ask for no other proof of fitness to fly, while others insist on a doctor's note. All airlines print their regulations on their website and it is best to check. If, as in the case of your friend, the airline clearly states that a doctor's certificate is required before allowing a passenger ith a cast to board, it is legally within its rights to have stopped her son from boarding.</p>",
  "<p>Russia's president Dimitry Medvedev yesterday signed a ceasefire agreement to end the bloody 10-day-old war in Georgia, but gave no clear indication of when he would begin to withdraw Russian troops.</p> <p>In a snub to the United States, which has demanded that Moscow remove its armed forces from Georgia immediately, Medvedev said the Russian military would remain inside Georgia until 'extra security measures' were in place.</p> <p>Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, gave no timetable for a pullout. He said Moscow would withdraw once security measures had been carried out in the conflict zone - the breakaway enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Last night, US President George Bush cautiously welcomed Russia's apparent commitment. He described the ceasefire deal, also signed by Georgia's President, Mikheil Saakashvili on Friday, as a 'helpful step'. Bush reaffirmed his commitment to Georgia's battered territorial integrity, saying that the issue was not up for debate.</p> <p>Britain's Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, also praised the latest move, but said he was 'concerned' by reports of continuing Russian military action.</p> <p>Russian troops last night appeared to be pulling slowly out of their forward positions. They left the town of Igoeti, about 48km from Tbilisi, in the afternoon. But they remain in at least half of the country - including the central towns of Gori and Khashuri, the western cities of Senaki and Zugdidi, and the Black Sea port of Poti. Reports last night from Georgia's foreign ministry said Russian-backed separatists from Abkhazia had taken over 13 villages in Georgia and a power plant.</p> <p>Yesterday Georgia claimed Russia was still destroying its civilian and military infrastructure. It said Russian soldiers had blown up a railway line near the town of Kaspi, outside Tbilisi - severing the last railway link between the east and west of the country. Moscow denied this.</p> <p>Russian military helicopters also attacked Borjomi national park - setting fire to huge areas of protected forest, Georgian officials said. Borjomi, a popular spa town since Tsarist times, is home to endangered species, including bears.</p> <p>Medvedev signed yesterday's agreement in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, 20km from the border with Abkhazia, Georgia's second breakaway province. Analysts said that they expected Russia to absorb Abkhazia and South Ossetia into the Russian Federation - possibly within days. Both territories are likely to hold referendums calling for a formal association with Russia.</p> <p>The six-point ceasefire agreement, which was drafted by France's President Nicolas Sarkozy in his role as EU president, authorises Russia to carry out 'additional security measures on a temporary basis' until an international peacekeeping force arrives in Georgia. This requires a UN resolution.</p> <p>There are growing claims of atrocities committed by irregular militias, to which the Russian forces are accused of turning a blind eye. The Observer has witnessed half a dozen assaults and robberies of civilians and journalists by mercenaries in the past five days.</p>",

Frozen corpses, believed to be those of members of the expedition, have been found in the area.

This year's search will last six weeks and will be followed by further explorations in 2009 and 2010 if need be.</p>",

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 24 2008</strong></p> <p> We said that if Labour loses the Glenrothes by-election '[Gordon] Brown will be the party's only MP in Fife, where not long ago it boasted all four.' But North-East Fife, the seat held by former Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell, has never been held by Labour and was previously held by the Conservatives.</p> <p> </p> <p>When Gordon Brown arrives tomorrow at Burntisland Parish Church in Fife he will join one of the most poignant gatherings of the Scottish political clans for several years. Politics will be suspended as dozens of Labour MPs and ministers, MSPs and councillors file into the striking post-Reformation church on the banks of the Forth estuary to bid farewell to the late Labour member for Glenrothes, John MacDougall. </p> <p>Alongside Brown, many others who have dominated Scottish politics in recent times are expected, including Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Liberal Democrat leader and MP for the neighbouring seat of Fife North East, and Henry McLeish, the former Labour First Minister.</p> <p>Mingling with the old guard, however, will be representatives of the newer, brasher and ever more assertive force in Scottish politics. Angus Robertson, youthful leader of the Scottish National Party at Westminster and the party's chairman, will attend as will Tricia Marwick, who stole the Scottish Parliament seat of Central Fife for the SNP from Labour last year in what many Scots saw as another sure sign of things to come.</p> <p>Since MacDougall, a popular MP and former leader of Fife Council, lost his lengthy battle against cancer last week, no one in Fife has dared talk publicly about the momentous effects his death could have on politics north - and south - of the border. But no one is any doubt as to what they could be. The Glenrothes constituency now up for grabs borders Brown's own Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat. This corner of Fife is the Prime Minister's own political fortress, his power base north of the border.</p> <p>For generations Fife, with its mines, docks and strong agricultural base, was solid Labour. But last year the resurgent Nationalists, in league with the Liberal Democrats, took over joint control of Fife council from Labour. 'Brown's council run by the Nats,' said one nationalist. 'Imagine it.' With Marwick also installed as the local MSP, the SNP has been highly active locally and firmly dug in for months. </p> <p>If, in October or November, it goes on to take Glenrothes, a Scottish new town which has always been staunchly Labour, Brown will be the party's only MP in Fife, where not long ago it boasted all four. 'That is the likely outcome: Brown surrounded,' said a party member.</p> <p>Hours after MacDougall died, the SNP - buoyant after its stunning success last month in Glasgow East - was instantly installed as the bookies' hot favourite. One Labour official observed that McDougall's passing was not just a 'personal tragedy' but also a 'political disaster'. By that he meant that defeat in the Glenrothes contest could well mark the end of Gordon Brown's premiership and throw Labour into yet more leadership turmoil that would let the Tories in.</p> <p>For the SNP, however, the battle of Glenrothes will be about far more than the fate of Gordon Brown. The party has momentum and senses that its big chance to change history is arriving. </p> <p>To Angus Roberston it is clear what is happening, not just in Fife but across Scotland. 'You are seeing the tectonic plates of Scottish politics shift fundamentally,' he says. 'The profound changes in Scotland over the last year prove that Scotland is heading in the direction of independence.' The polls confirm the mood. The SNP opened up a record 19 per cent lead over Labour in one this week. For its part, Labour seems shot through with fear about the SNP, and uncertainty - not least about who will stand for the seat. One of the possible Labour candidates said that many in the party felt 'tired and hurt that local people had turned against them' and switched allegiance to the Nationalists. She was not certain whether she would put herself forward to face everything the slick SNP machine could throw at her. Another possible candidate, Alex Rowley, a councillor and friend of Brown (and known by some as 'Gordon Brown's representative on earth'), is said to be out of the running, mainly because his closeness to the Prime Minister is regarded as an electoral liability.</p> <p>McLeish, who had to quit as First Minister in a scandal over office expenses, is being touted by some, partly because he is a 'name' but more, it seems, because he has been appointed to sit on various policy commissions by Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, and is seen as a 'virtual Nat' who could defuse the real SNP threat. </p> <p>Equally difficult for Labour in Glenrothes is the simple question of 'Gordon Brown: will he turn up or won't he?' Having cited the convention that Prime Ministers do not take part in byelections as his reason for staying away from the recent contests in Crewe and Nantwich and Glasgow East, the Prime Minister is in a difficult position. 'He is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't,' said a Nationalist official. 'If he turns up, it's a panic U-turn. If he doesn't he's running scared in his own backyard and doesn't want to be associated with failure.'</p> <p>The brutal truth is that it is the Nationalists who have the wind in their sails. They are raring to go and now have another platform from which to shout about policies that have proved genuinely popular since they took over at Holyrood last year - such as scrapping road tolls on the Forth and Tay road bridges and freezing council tax.</p> <p>Robertson is proud of what he says is his party's relentlessly positive 'healthier, wealthier, fairer, greener,' campaign message since it gained 20 seats in the 2007 elections and became the largest party in the Scottish Parliament. 'The transition from opposition to government was very well worked through,' he says. </p> <p>When Robertson joined the party in 1985 the SNP was at 11 per cent in the polls and had two MPs. Last week a YouGov poll commissioned by the Nationalists put it on 36 per cent in terms of Westminster voting intentions, with Labour on 29. If replicated at a general election the SNP says this would give it around 26 MPs, exceeding Salmond's target of 20. The current total of SNP MPs is seven.</p> <p>Robertson insists the groundswell of support 'is in large part down to the growing confidence of people in Scotland who are no longer prepared to accept the limited horizons of the Labour party and Westminster government, while watching Scotland governed by a party that delivers on its promises,' he says. He 'truly believes' the SNP is now powering towards its ultimate goal of a referendum on independence in 2010. 'The hopes of Scottish Labour that devolution would \"kill the SNP stone dead\" have been proved false,' he says.</p> <p>Most alarmingly for Labour is that it is not just the SNP that is blowing this particular trumpet. Chris Parr, the politically non-aligned chief executive of Tullis Russell Paper Mill, one of the biggest employers in the Glenrothes constituency, has been hugely impressed by the way the SNP government has supported local industry in recent months. Recently the party helped secure a \u00a3100m biomass power plant in Glenrothes that he says will safeguard hundreds of jobs at his company. And the SNP has rekindled interest in Scottish politics in a way he had not expected.</p> <p>'I have to say they have been very impressive in the way they have supported industry and manufacturing,' he said. 'A lot of people have been very pleasantly surprised. It is the talk of the Scottish dinner party circuit.'</p>",
  "<p>Every morning Paul Convery walks out of his front door to be confronted by piles of discarded coffee cups and sandwich wrappings. There is an unmistakable stench of urine. The pavements are filled with stocky, intimidating men with glowering expressions and the parking spaces have all been taken by battered 4x4s that have not paid or displayed.</p> <p>'The neighbours down the road are woken nightly at around 3am by the sounds of taxi doors slamming, shuffling of feet, shouting and excitement,' he says. But this is no unexplained urban menace: this is the modern paparazzi at work. Convery has the misfortune to live on the same north London street as Peaches Geldof, the ubiquitous celebrity poppet whose picture is much in demand from tabloid newspapers and glossy magazines.</p> <p>'We have had up to a dozen paparazzi hanging out for 12 to 18 hours at a stretch, eating, drinking, urinating on the street, having barbecues,' says Convery, a local Labour councillor who was recently moved to write a letter to Geldof suggesting she 'slope off for a few weeks' to give residents a holiday. 'These guys are like professional wrestlers who have picked up a camera. They have access to a range of expletives that they use with ease. They are very aggressive and remind me of the hard men you would try to avoid at a bar. These are people who have had the empathy sucked out of their life systems.'</p> <p>This summer the British paparazzi have gone into overdrive. First, Geldof was alleged to have collapsed at home in July from a rumoured drugs overdose - which she denies - causing a spike of interest and a rash of tabloid photographs. That was further exacerbated last week by her marriage in Las Vegas, aged 19, to an unknown American rocker: cue front-page pictures of Geldof sporting an oversized wedding ring, looking sheepish. Then there have been the constant snatched images of Amy Winehouse shuttling to and from rehab and the blurry shots of Sienna Miller wrapped around a new boyfriend.</p> <p>The pursuit has been relentless. Miller, who has been dating the married actor Balthazar Getty, broke down in tears at a Los Angeles garage on Monday when photographers swarmed round her car and asked questions about her alleged 'home-wrecking'. She later complained to police and was given an escort back to her Beverly Hills hotel.</p> <p>Last week the actress Keira Knightley complained that paparazzi intrusion was 'a very predatory force'. 'When you are leaving your front door and paparazzi, who are a lot bigger than you, are shouting \"You're a whore\" to try to make you cry - that obviously is not great,' she said in an interview with Tatler magazine. 'If you look at the biggest film stars, they do not get paparazzi'ed that much, partly because they've already had it so much that they just close themselves off in their houses and don't leave them.'</p> <p>After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in a Paris car chase in 1997, there was a collective pause for breath by newspaper and magazine editors who pledged not to use snatched images. But now, 11 years later, the fragile boundary between feeding the public interest and maintaining an individual's right to privacy appears to have been breached by a new breed of guerrilla paparazzi.</p> <p>The market has taken a disquieting turn. Our ghoulish fascination with images depicting stars in various states of disintegration has ensured that these pictures often carry a higher monetary value. Just think of Winehouse, chalk-faced and bleary-eyed, pictured wandering the streets in her underwear last December. Or Britney Spears, who was photographed strapped to a hospital stretcher in January after tearfully refusing to hand over custody of her children. Both images would have sold for thousands of pounds.</p> <p>'I don't know a single agency photographer who would shout that kind of insult [to Keira Knightley], and the agency wouldn't employ them if they did,' says one showbiz photographer who declined to be named. 'The problem is you're getting more and more freelance guys who think they can make a quick buck just by buying a camera and pitching up on a doorstep. They can be quite aggressive and focused. They're like hunters following prey, because the game has got much more competitive and that encourages a kind of survival of the fittest.'</p> <p>Almost anyone can be a paparazzo now - all that is required is a digital camera, sharp eyes and a satnav that can direct you to Sadie Frost's house in Primrose Hill. Bystanders can take snaps of celebrities on their mobile phones and sell them to gossip websites within minutes. Heat magazine alone receives 10,000 to 20,000 electronic images every day from readers.</p> <p>Why do we find paparazzi images so fascinating? 'I think it's because it's easily digestible entertainment,' says Perez Hilton, the influential American celebrity blogger. 'It's fun escapism.' A full-size picture of the most bankable celebrities - Kate Moss, Kylie Minogue, Knightley or Miller - can fetch \u00a3200. But the value of the shot depends on the story behind it: an exclusive set of Winehouse leaving a rehab clinic, for instance, can be worth up to \u00a330,000.</p> <p>'Female celebrities always sell better than men because the magazine readership is overwhelmingly female,' says Alex Stanger, an entertainment reporter for BBC News 24. 'Women want to see other women not looking so great. A shot of someone's armpit hair or cellulite sells more than a lovely, set-up, airbrushed photo.'</p> <p>The increasingly fevered competition means that a dedicated paparazzo must stick like glue to his target. This has led to a surge in the number of car chases - or 'follows', in paparazzi-speak. Not for nothing has the new generation of showbiz photographers become known as 'the stalkerazzi'. John Mayer, the singer-songwriter ex-boyfriend of Jennifer Aniston, complained earlier this month that photographers were routinely breaking the speed limit and shooting red lights.</p> <p>In fashionable areas, the joke goes that you are never more than six feet away from a paparazzo. In Los Angeles the city council is considering a so-called 'Britney law' that would seek to license paparazzi and introduce regulatory measures such as making them have a fluorescent 'P' on their number plates. Elsewhere, a group of Malibu locals attacked paparazzi who were trying to take shots of the actor Matthew McConaughey surfing.</p> <p>'Celebrities are constantly being hounded now because the market is so saturated,' says Stanger. 'I interviewed George Clooney recently and he said to me that he has to be so much more aware than he was five years ago because now he goes to a restaurant and he won't know whether the nice couple next to him will start filming him on their camera phones. That means it is getting a bit more vicious.</p> <p>'But it's a two-way street: celebrities need paparazzi as much as the paparazzi need them, and some of them will have a relationship with certain photographers. Victoria Beckham was always rumoured to have a guy she would call up to say: \"I'm going to the petrol station at this time, take a photo of me then.\"</p> <p>'It's a weird, double-edged relationship. Amy Winehouse makes tea for her paparazzi and Britney Spears ended up going out with one [Adnan Ghalib], so it's almost like they're the only friends they have left. It's quite incestuous.'</p> <p>Admittedly certain celebrities at the lower end of the fame spectrum rely on paparazzi shots to raise their profile. Others, like Kylie Minogue, agree to stop and smile on the proviso that they are then left alone. If the famous do not seek attention, so the argument goes, it is easy to avoid.</p> <p>'If they don't like it, they can just move,' says Perez Hilton. 'Julia Roberts moved to New Mexico. Sandra Bullock moved to Texas. There's nothing worse than celebrities who complain or hide their faces for pictures. So long as the paparazzi aren't breaking the law, celebs just need to put up with it.'</p> <p>Certainly it would be unfair to assume that the paparazzi are operating in a vacuum. They are simply feeding the demand, both from the public and from the celebrities themselves. There is, too, a certain code of honour among agency photographers, who react with horror if you label them with the 'p'-word.</p> <p>'I would say very strongly that our organisation would not condone anyone making a celebrity cry,' says Alan Williams, chief executive of Big Pictures. 'I'm not saying those photographers don't exist, just that they're not employed by our agency.'</p> <p>That offers scant comfort for celebrities who feel hounded. Nor does it give much succour to the likes of the unfortunate Paul Convery, who is not a celebrity and has never sought to be. As he continues to battle his way through the disposable barbecues, one can only hope that Peaches doesn't do anything too newsworthy in the weeks to come. Perhaps, as Perez Hilton suggests, she should move to New Mexico. Then, at least, the residents of his street would get their parking spaces back.</p> <h2>What it's like for the neighbours</h2> <p>Living virtually next door to Amy Winehouse is no easy ride. It's not so much the antics of Amy herself that keep her neighbours up at night, but rather those of the small army of hangers-on and paparazzi milling around at all hours. </p> <p>Though she is hardly ever around, Amy-watching is a 24-hour-a-day industry, with the end of the road always blocked with cars and scooters, while taxis and deliveries arrive at all hours, causing the street to be lit up with flashes.</p> <p>Bored with hanging around all day and night, 3am games of football among paparazzi using parked cars as goalposts are not uncommon. </p> <p>That said, there are some notable advantages to having a celebrity neighbour. House prices aside, the presence of a dozen photographers and a pair of burly security guards keeping a 24-hour vigil helps make the street one of the safest and most crime-free in the whole of north London. </p> <p>Even if it is mostly through a siege mentality, her presence encourages conversation between neighbours and even promotes a small sense of community not seen in many places in the city. </p> <p>Plus, being one step ahead of the gossip columns definitely impresses friends and colleagues, with most being at least a little curious or even jealous.<br><strong>David Hewitt</strong></p>",
  "<p>After the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, most people will have had their fill of fantasy and fakery. But for the insatiable, there's a two-hour banquet of such fare in Hellboy II: The Golden Army, a sleek action picture by Guillermo del Toro, who's making a corner for himself in the horror-fantasy world in his native Mexico, in Hollywood and in Spain. He's riding high after Pan's Labyrinth won Oscars for best cinematography, art direction and make-up and following the success of the Spanish horror movie The Orphanage, directed by his protege, Juan Antonio Bayona. His next project is a two-part version of The Hobbit from a screenplay by Peter Jackson.</p> <p>Del Toro's best films, The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, are rooted in the brutal experience of the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath and had at least one cloven foot in reality. His first Hellboy picture, which appeared four years ago, and its sequel are lighter in tone, though more consistently violent. A comic book character created by Mike Mignola, Hellboy is a benign red creature from the underworld, the child of Lucifer, given his name by American soldiers into whose hands he falls when secret rites are being conducted by satanic Nazis in Second World War Scotland. </p> <p>He's subsequently adopted and raised by Professor Trevor Broom (John Hurt), a kindly Englishman who works for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Development (BPRD), a top secret organisation created by President Roosevelt. In the first film, set in 2004, he's grown into a giant with a massive right-hand punch. His horns are cropped, his satanic tail drags behind him, his enemies are neo-Nazis and the malevolent reincarnated Rasputin. It's like a canny cross between Alien, Raiders of the Lost Ark, X-Men and Men in Black.</p> <p>Hellboy II kicks off with a pre-credit scene providing a new backstory. It's Christmas 1955 and Professor Broom is telling the young Hellboy how a truce was declared in a warring society by a benevolent king, who breaks his crown into three pieces. Only when they are joined up again will fighting erupt once more between humans and an army of golden warriors. This part is rather beautifully rendered by wooden Danish puppets that convey the magic of a mythic Nordic past. Jump to the present and the evil Prince Nuada is aroused from millennial slumber to restore the crown and bring chaos to the world, though given the present situation you might wonder who'd notice.</p> <p>Opposing Nuada is his beautiful twin-sister Princess Nuala and the creatures inhabiting the basement of the BPRD's headquarters in New Jersey. The joke is that they're an amiable collection of misfits devoted to the service of mankind: the wise-cracking, cigar-chomping Hellboy (Ron Perlman), his girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair), who breaks out in flames when emotionally aroused, and the aquatic Abe Sapien (Doug Jones). They're joined from Washington by a new commander, Johann Krauss, a brilliant German who resembles an old-fashioned deep-sea diver, can send forth ectoplasm to possess other bodies and speaks a comically formal English. The only human of any significance is Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), a bald, bumbling, prissy bureaucrat from an old Hollywood tradition. </p> <p>The film's first setpiece takes place in a New York auction house where part of the ancient crown is being sold. Prince Nuada appears, does unspeakable Alien-like things to the auctioneer and lets all hell loose on the fashionable bidders. This is the true stuff of nightmares as thousands of small carnivorous creatures resembling the blind, toothy figures in Francis Bacon's Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion run riot. There are numerous bizarre creatures on view later, but none this terrifying. The second setpiece is a visit to the Trolls' Market, a less congenial version of London's subterranean goblins' world in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and for some reason located beneath Brooklyn Bridge. This leads to a stupendously destructive scene where Hellboy takes on a giant plant with tentacles that grow out of a green bouncing bean. Throughout the fight, he's clutching a baby he's saved from death, sometimes holding the child with his tail; it ends with him getting no thanks from the mother.</p> <p>For a while, the movie becomes contemplative, at times even tongue-in-cheek sentimental, in the magnificent library of BPRD. Abe Sapiens and Hellboy get drunk and bond in a parody of buddy movies and Abe falls in love with Princess Nuala after discovering their shared love for Tennyson's verse. This is by way of preparation for the grand finale which takes place in the magic faerie world beneath the Giant's Causeway, Northern Ireland. Here, a kung-fu sword-and-sorcery showdown is staged amid a giant, constantly moving, interlocking construction of cog-wheels and ratchets. The machinery, according to del Toro, is a homage to Chaplin's Modern Times. Earlier, there's a running joke in which old Universal horror flicks, The Bridge of Frankenstein and Creature From the Black Lagoon among them, are shown among the banks of CCTV screens at the BPRD headquarters. </p> <p>This Hollywood movie was shot largely in Hungary, the music was recorded in London and the opening sequence was made in Denmark. The final credits conclude with the statement: 'The depictions of tobacco smoking contained in this film are based solely on artistic consideration and are not intended to promote tobacco consumption.'</p>",
  "<p>Judy was, until very recently, a normal 61-year-old great grandmother from rural Arkansas who taught English at the local middle school and spent her spare time taking care of five troublesome terriers.</p> <p>Now, in a story reminiscent of the 1960s sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies, she has joined a rapidly growing group of millionaires cashing in on a natural gas gold rush that is sweeping the American south.</p> <p>The Haynesville Shale is a massive geological formation 12,000 feet below the soil of rural north-west Louisiana that is said to contain enough natural gas to supply much of America's needs for the next decade and beyond. It has been known about for years, but only recently has the technology been available to exploit it to the full.</p> <p>The world's biggest natural gas exploration companies, including Shell, Conoco, Chesapeake, Petrohawk and EnCana, have descended on the vast area between the Arkansas border and Shreveport, Louisiana, to tap what most experts agree is a reservoir of about 240 trillion cubic feet of gas.</p> <p>Local farmers own the land above these massive gas pockets, as do a large number of householders and some speculators, and there are large tracts owned by the State of Louisiana. And if the gas giants want to get their equipment drilling working in time to cash in they are having to pay up - big time.</p> <p>'The reality is there is a lot of people making some pretty damn serious money down here thanks to this natural gas,' said Don Briggs, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association.</p> <p>And Judy - who wants to withhold her last name for fear of attracting too much attention to her newfound wealth - is one of them.</p> <p>Judy's parents were farmers on the outskirts of Bossier City, Louisiana until her father passed away when she was seven. 'I inherited half the farm that day, I was an only child,' Judy said. 'I inherited the rest in 1991.'</p> <p>She vowed never to sell the land, even though half of it was virtually worthless swampland. But then, in March this year, her telephone at home in Arkansas started ringing non stop with gas company reps and land brokers offering to buy or lease her land.</p> <p>\"First they were offering me $200 an acre, then $500, but I am not stupid,\" Judy said, 'I told them that if their gas was so precious they would have to come up with something better.'</p> <p>After a couple of months of stiff negotiating she walked away with a cheque for about $4.5m, and she didn't even have to sell her land. 'I leased the land to Chesapeake for five years, after which they have to put it back exactly as they found it,' Judy said.</p> <p>Much of the land that sits above the Haynesville Shale had a lease value of about $300 an acre until this spring, when a ferocious bidding war broke out. Now the same tracts of land are commanding prices as high as $25,000 and $30,000 an acre, so locals say.</p> <p>And by the time the big gas companies have finished, there will be plenty more hillbilly millionaires like Judy. 'It is possibly the fourth largest gas discovery in the world and the largest in the United States,' said Briggs. 'It's big.'</p> <p>But drilling the shale is an expensive business. 'The shale lies like blankets - flat blankets of geologic formations on top of each other,' Briggs said. 'You drill down 12,000 feet, on average, make a right angle and go up to another 4,000 feet. It's incredible technology.'</p> <p>With the record amounts being paid for leases, bonuses and up to 25 per cent royalties, 'a lot of millionaires are being made every day,' Briggs added. </p> <p>Given that most of the rest of the country is grappling with the credit crunch and impending recession, the country folk of Louisiana and Arkansas are rightly celebrating their newfound prosperity. Those not fortunate enough to own land above the shale are benefiting from the jobs and investment flooding into the area.</p> <p>'I would say 74 wells are working in the area now, 50 more than are normally working in all of north Louisiana,' Briggs said. 'Probably by the end of the year there will be 100, and by the end of next year, 200. That's an incredible amount of activity.'</p> <p>As for Judy, she is not letting her millions go to her head. 'I think I will get my bathroom renovated, finally,' she said, 'and then I will give some money to my three sons, my eight grandchildren and my great grandchild.'</p> <p>And then of course there are the dogs, all five of whom are yapping at her feet. 'I might get them some new toys, it depends if they are good or not.'</p>",
  "<p>First there was wonderful Spasija from Macedonia, by whom all other au pairs have subsequently been judged (and yes, at this point male readers may put the magazine down and find a small city in the Caucasus to raze or a nice shelf to put up. We're in Polly Filler territory), who stayed nine months before her visa ran out, but left her goldfish, Walter. It's still alive, but grew up to be a carp. </p> <p>Spasija was followed by Katy, from Hungary, who had the body of a supermodel (I'd recruited her on the basis of a smudgy headshot) but despite this potential setback (if only for me) was very good with my son. Spasija and Katy are both now my 'friends' on Facebook.</p> <p>Just when I was starting to get a bit smug about my ability to recruit and nurture top-class au-pairage, along came Magda, who had a degree in child psychology, but also believed kids should be allowed to express themselves in any way they saw fit, anywhere, anytime, and to hell with the consequences. My son was two and I figured we all needed a few boundaries, so Magda lasted six fraught weeks before being replaced by an Israeli girl who arrived with more clothes than me. After two pouty, princessy months I finally removed the packet of frozen peas from beneath her mattress and 'let' her 'go'. </p> <p>Shortly after Diana (Hungary 2, Israel 0) - who was great right up until the point when she did an emergency bunk under tragic circumstances (not least for her) - I found myself with two children and decided to trade-up to a qualified nanny. Sophie, infinitely more qualified to look after my children than I am, was with us for a year before her father persuaded her to go and work in his deli, while her equally delightful and qualified bestfriend, Jo, managed seven months before deciding to go to uni, but last week both girls came round to take the boys out for a sugar-rushed day at a theme park, out of the goodness of their hearts, for fun, not money. I love them only marginally less than my sons do.</p> <p>By now a single parent, when Jo's replacement lasted 48 hours (before bursting into tears and revealing she was unable to continue due to compelling personal reasons) leaving me holding the baby with only a school run, 500 words and a tax return to fit into the next 40 minutes, I a) burst into tears myself, and b) realised that, sod the sisterhood, I'd had enough of girls, even lovely ones. </p> <p>Which is how I came to fill my spare room with Attila ('Yes,' he said wearily, 'as in \"the Hun\"'), from Slovakia, looking to brush up his English before returning to finish an MA in media studies and embark on a career as a sports writer. </p> <p>After surviving a trial-by-two-small-boys-and-a-trampoline in France, he has returned to let them beat him with blunt objects and fart in his face, which are areas of parenting I admittedly find quite trying.</p> <p>I happily overlook the fact that Attila can sleep for 12 hours, can't cook but eats more food than I thought physically possible and spends every spare moment watching Sky Sports because he came with glowing references from a previous au-pair job ('No, he's definitely not a predatory paedophile'). And then last week, when the boys went on holiday with their father, he put up a blind in the bathroom. Result! </p> <p>Naturally, the first question all my female friends ask about Attila is the predictable 'Is he fit?!' To which the answer is, yes - he's 24 and plays a lot of football ... But no, I didn't think it sensible to hire someone who'd make me feel a bit Cat on a Hot Tin Roof when all I wanted him to do was kick footballs, put the rubbish out and take those farts like a man. </p> <p>In exchange I am paying off Attila's student loan and have rashly promised to swing him a week's work experience on The Observer sports desk. I haven't run this by the sports desk as yet, but even if they can't find anything specifically sports-related for Attila to do, I can assure them he won't mind if they just sit around farting and beating him with blunt objects. It's a fine quality in any employee, I'm sure you'll agree - and if looking for a career in journalism, potentially a very useful one, too.<br><a href=\"mailto:kate.flett@observer.co.uk\"><br>kate.flett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Fans of football teams with no hope of winning the league get their thrills from derbies or the occasional giant killing in the early rounds of the FA Cup. In politics, the top prizes are sewn up even more tidily than the Premier League. At Westminster, Labour and the Tories fight over first place, while the Liberal Democrats creatively explore different ways to come third.</p> <p>A new season is about to get under way and, while no one can rule out a spectacular upset, it looks as if Team Cameron has the title in the bag.</p> <p>Scotland and Wales have their own nationalist dynamics, of course. But in England, too, there is action away from the centre that, like a good mid-table clash, makes for compelling viewing, even though less is ostensibly at stake. The prize is fourth place and two parties - the Greens and the BNP - are in contention.</p> <p>In London's mayoral election, the Green candidate Sian Berry and the BNP's Richard Barnbrook received 77,374 and 69,710 votes respectively. The Greens also kept the BNP in fifth place in the ballot for the London Assembly, taking two seats to the BNP's one. Meanwhile, the far right beat the environmentalists in four out of 14 Assembly constituencies. Nationally, at local council level, the Greens are just ahead of the BNP - 47 seats to 37 - though the far right made twice as many gains as the Greens in May's elections. In June's Henley byelection, 73 votes separated the Greens and the BNP in third and fourth places. Labour came fifth.</p> <p>So what? First past the post makes it impossible for tiny parties to break through and, with around 1 per cent of the national vote each, these minnows would struggle under any voting system. Westminster is not about to be overrun by hippies or fascists.</p> <p>But the Green versus BNP competition matters. For a start, if a party dedicated to saving the 'traditional British genotype' from 'extinction' by mixed-race marriages gets roughly as many votes as a party dedicated to saving the planet from climate change, something is wrong. </p> <p>Of course, the Greens have had their issue poached by the big three, while the far right has anti-miscegenation policy all to itself. But fringe parties don't compete with the mainstream in the usual way. If voters are simply shopping around for a party that sounds tough on immigration, for example, they could vote Tory or, for that matter, Labour, which has tacked steadily rightwards on the issue in recent years. The point of the BNP is that they see everything - housing, the economy, crime - through the prism of race. When mainstream politicians talk about immigration as a problem, the potential BNP voter takes it as confirmation of his fears, while retaining the suspicion that the Establishment won't do anything about it. Green voters feel similarly about their cause. Labour and Tory pledges on the environment are seen as empty rhetoric. (The crucial difference is that the Greens' cause is a good one.) </p> <p>A fringe party represents people who meet two criteria. First, they deeply distrust the three main players, seeing them as out of touch, dishonest and incapable of addressing some issue that matters to them above all others. Second, they bother to vote. Think of the Greens and the BNP competing to lead the political wing of British cynicism. Clearly, that is another reason why we should care which of them does better. </p> <p>That cynicism thrives when people feel alienated from a distant ruling class, believing that, for all their professed differences, the main parties are basically 'all the same'. That is not a difficult proposition to sell at the moment.</p> <p>The great truism of English politics is that elections are won on the centre ground. Tony Blair held it for 10 years, now David Cameron claims it. A big argument these days amounts to the whether there should be more academy schools or loads more academy schools? Should the NHS be opened up to 'competition' or just 'contestability'?</p> <p>And that is the concrete stuff. In the absence of competing policies, a bizarre battle has erupted for possession of abstract nouns. Immigration Minister Liam Byrne, often dubbed a 'rising star' of the Labour party (can stars rise when the sky is falling?), wrote an article last week rubbishing David Cameron's claim to the idea of 'fraternity'. The Tories, meanwhile, in a bid to undermine a Gordon Brown comeback in the autumn, are campaigning this week on the issue of 'fairness', the Prime Minister's new favourite word after he lost 'prudence' to the credit crunch.</p> <p>All this posturing is based on evidence that the voting public, as it showed by rejecting the Tories in their angry, sulking years, likes moderation. But that doesn't tell you anything about the non-voting public. More people abstained in both of the last two general elections than endorsed the winning side.</p> <p>That might be because we are a nation of sloths who only bother to choose between candidates if they are up for eviction via premium-rate phone line. But it is also because political debate has become so arcane and is getting worse. Is David Miliband Blairite, post-Blairite or Blair-lite? To people with better things to do than read think-tank pamphlets all day, the difference is not obvious.</p> <p>All parties are in the centre, but with no clear direction of travel. Their political compasses are liable to be influenced by whichever fringe manages to exert the strongest magnetic pull. That gives influence to a maverick fourth party, especially when one of the big three is lost in the wilderness. When the Tories were in disarray, they were further destabilised by the UK Independence party. The presence of a militant anti-Europe wing over the past decade successfully skewed mainstream politics. England now has a fixed Eurosceptic bias.</p> <p>Ukip looks like a spent force. It didn't achieve withdrawal from the EU, but helped to shape the debate. The same process could affect the way mainstream parties talk about the environment or immigration, depending on how the Greens and the BNP perform.</p> <p>The BNP's recent local election results were surprisingly good given that the party is in schism. Last year, a 'Real BNP' faction formed in rebellion against party leader Nick Griffin, who is accused of failing to modernise, being 'arrogant' (just like in ordinary politics) and deploying the 'security department' of the party to burgle rebel members' homes (not so like ordinary politics). Richard Barnbrook, who, as a London Assembly member, is the BNP's highest elected official, has a different challenge building a substantial far right following. He has to live down HMS Discovery: A Love Story, a film he made in 1989 that includes scenes of naked men frolicking and a soundtrack of apparently gay erotic poetry. 'It was an art film, end of story. Not a bloody porn film,' he says.</p> <p>For the Greens, the problem has not been too many leaders, but none at all. They have traditionally been led by two 'principal speakers' mandated to represent the party in public, but not decide policy. That will change next month when they hold their first leadership election, which is almost certain to be won by MEP Caroline Lucas. She is intelligent and articulate. Griffin just about manages louche charisma.</p> <p>The question is: which of them would we rather see hogging the airwaves on election night? Both parties are hoping to gain their first Westminster seat at the next election - the Greens in Brighton Pavilion, the BNP in the new east London constituency of Dagenham and Rainham. Both need the votes of disgruntled Labour supporters to win. If, as looks likely, the Tories are cruising towards an easy victory, disproportionate attention will be paid to the impact of wild-card candidates. (Remember a foaming Jimmy Goldsmith taunting David Mellor out of his seat in 1997?) As Labour heads into the wilderness, there will be much opining on what the protest vote meant.</p> <p>Everyone takes some interest in who tops the political Premier League. After all, the winner gets to run the country. But there are rewards available lower down the table. There is a nail-biting competition for the Uefa Cup place of English politics - the opportunity to give political shape to much wider scepticism and disillusionment; to be the flag-bearer for anti-Establishment feeling. Our nation would be in a sorry state if the BNP beat the Greens to that prize.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Andrew Rawnsley is away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday August 18 2008. In London's mayoral election, the Green candidate Sian Berry did not comfortably beat the BNP's Richard Barnbrook by 409,101 votes to 198,319, as suggested in the article above. The candidates received 77,374 and 69,710 votes respectively. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>Pulling each other by the hair, the Roma children scrap as they take turns at flicking their skinny wrists over the flaming funeral candles. Before the same Orthodox Christian shrine, their grandmother recites the Lord's Prayer in a gravelly Romany tongue. </p> <p>'Am Mora Dat con san ando cheri.' The words leave her mouth in whispers as she crosses herself and kisses a gold crucifix around her neck. The smallest child, no older than four, runs towards me, sticks out her tongue, and gestures a V for vaffanculo - the ubiquitous Italian fuck off - and disappears outside.</p> <p>The damp ceiling of the two-room prefabricated hut the Gypsies call home is on the verge of collapse. The plastic-film windows, looking out on to the drab exterior walls of Naples's most infamous prison, are so flimsy they wobble in the faint breeze. There are mattresses everywhere: on the floor, propped up against the sink. Like the inhabitants, they are thin and threadbare. The only nod to modernity is a gigantic home entertainment consul in the corner, spewing out a DVD of distorted recordings of Balkan folk songs. The wake we are attending in Naples's most notorious Romany camp has been going for 10 days. Alcohol is scattered around the room; clear, foul-smelling moonshine sits overflowing from plastic cups and reclaimed Peroni bottles; a half-blind mongrel sleeps fitfully among the detritus of a thousand hand-rolled cigarettes. </p> <p>Alongside a sepia portrait of the revered Capuchin friar, Padre Pio, stand blurry digital prints of 13-year-old Cristina and 11-year-old Violetta Djeordsevic - two Roma sisters whose sudden deaths in the shallow waters of a public beach on Italy's Amalfi Coast last month encapsulated the threat of racism in modern Europe. It is a tragedy that has focused international attention on the ragged edge of Italy's most chaotic city. The teenagers' youth and beauty in the photographs, strangely, comes as a shock. Up until now, like most of the world, I had only seen their prostrate bodies, covered by short beach towels, with just their feet left exposed, on the scruffy beach at Torregaveta, a decrepit seaside suburb on the outer edge of the Bay of Naples. </p> <p>On the morning of 17 July, Cristina and Violetta, along with their cousins Manuela and Diana, had made the regular journey from the dismal camp we are sitting in to one of Naples's most popular beaches. Walking two miles to the nearest public transport link, and skipping aboard the local train that skirts the coastal cliffs of the city, the girls planned to sell trinkets - small wooden turtles carved by Nigerian immigrants - to daytrippers along the bay. At Torregaveta, after a long hot day with no sales, the sisters dared each other to jump from rocks into the sea. Violetta went first and disappeared, swept beneath the waves. Cristina, the eldest, jumped in to save her. Both drowned, clinging on to each other. </p> <p>What happened next shocked the world.</p> <p>The girls were recovered from the sea by a passer-by and later declared dead by a lifeguard who called for help as Manuela and Diana wept, banging their tiny fists on the corpses. </p> <p>As the police arrived, their cousins, distraught and in shock, were taken away to contact relatives. Two beach towels were used to cover the dead Roma girls. And then something extraordinary occurred. </p> <p>Summer beach life resumed around the bodies for three hours until an ambulance finally showed up. In the most striking image of all, a couple nonchalantly ate a picnic while looking on at the scene. Another threw a frisbee nearby. The indifference, picked up by newspapers and TV stations across the world, was seen by the country's liberal elite to be the final straw. The most senior Catholic in Naples, Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe, was the quickest to point out the coarsening of human sentiment which the behaviour in Torregaveta represented: 'Cristina and Violetta,' he told the Italian media, 'had faced nothing but prejudice in life and indifference in death; an unforgivable truth.' </p> <p>In Rome, the government winced. Masters of realpolitik, they knew that the deaths of Cristina and Violetta, both born in Italy but full-blood Roma, had come at a bad time for the nation, forced in recent months to defend itself to its European neighbours on charges of discrimination against Gypsies and immigrants. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who swept to power for a third time on a thinly disguised anti-immigration ticket, was in the middle of a controversial yet populist programme of fingerprinting the country's 150,000 Roma, some of whose families have been in Italy since the middle ages. According to critics it has become impossible to disguise the Fascist undertones of these actions, and they point to the fact that the first expulsions of Gypsies took place in 1926 under Benito Mussolini. The dictator's political heirs, the 'post-fascist' National Alliance, are now coalition partners in Berlusconi's government. </p> <p>In May this year, rumours of an abduction of a baby girl by a Gypsy woman in Naples triggered an orgy of violence against Roma camps by thugs wielding iron bars, who torched caravans and drove Gypsies from their slum homes in dozens of assaults, orchestrated by the notoriously violent local mafia, the Camorra. The response of Berlusconi's government? 'That is what happens when Gypsies steal babies,' shrugged Roberto Maroni, Italy's interior minister and a key Berlusconi ally. </p> <p>For the 10m Europeans all loosely labelled as Roma or Gypsies, life is an endless procession of marginalisation and prejudice. Corralled into settlements across the continent, 84 per cent of Roma in Europe are estimated to live below the poverty line. Perhaps even more shocking is the lack of a more detailed picture. Official indifference and reluctance on the part of the Roma themselves means data on life expectancy, infant mortality, employment and literacy rates are sparse. Yet all are likely to be lower than those of mainstream society.</p> <p>The plight of the Roma has been a part of European life since their mysterious migration from Rajasthan around 1,000AD. Queen Elizabeth I was the first who sought to expel the Roma from England. German Emperor Karl VI ordered their extermination in 1721. In parts of the Balkans, Roma were traded as slaves until the middle of the 19th century. In the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of Roma perished in the Nazi Holocaust, known in Gypsy folklore as the Porrajmos or 'The Devouring'. How Roma like Cristina and Violetta came to be born in Naples has more to do with the modern legacy of war in the Balkans. In the early Nineties, thousands of Gypsies crossed the Adriatic after the outbreak of fighting in Yugoslavia and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. For many of the Gypsies, the majority of whom were illegal immigants, lawless Naples was the place where they could disappear into the chaos.</p> <p>It's 6.30am in the graffiti-strewn centro storico of Old Naples. Two young priests whizz past on an ancient canary-yellow Vespa, the engine putt-putting through the silent streets. Running a red light and skirting the baroque entrance to the chapel of San Lorenzo Maggiore, the seminarians roughly scrape the kerb and abandon the scooter. They are late for morning prayers. Down through the narrow cobblestone streets, far below them, is the harbour and the azure Mediterranean. </p> <p>Sparkling in the morning sunshine, the waters of the bay stretch west, out towards the dark mass of Vesuvius and Campi Flegrei, the 'burning fields', the volcanic plateau the Greeks once thought were the gates to hell.</p> <p>Morning comes slowly here. Old men, their wrinkled faces as scorched and cracked as the dry earth, are the first to emerge, setting out white plastic chairs on the narrow streets outside their tenement homes as their wives clatter pans indoors and get on with their morning chores. </p> <p>Armed with soapy water and sponges, a ragged group of municipal workers sets about removing hundreds of posters that have appeared across the city overnight. 'Diritti per tutti' (Rights for all). 'White, black, yellow, red. Stop apartheid now,' they proclaim beneath crude images of fingerprints. Beneath the new posters lie fading old ones calling for the mass deportation of Naples's Roma Gypsies and immigrants.</p> <p>'Italy is divided on these girls, on the fate of the Roma. The conscience of the people has been pricked. You can see this on the walls of our city,' says Francesca Saudino, our early morning guide and a campaigning Naples-based lawyer with Osservazione, a nationwide pressure group for Roma rights. 'The reaction to the death of these children goes beyond anything that has happened before. The incident has exposed a long-held social realism in our country: that many working-class people think the Roma no better than animals, and the government is using this xenophobia to win votes and popularity. People are ashamed. The deaths of these girls has come to represent something more, perhaps a battle for Italy's soul.' </p> <p>We are heading to Scampia, the toughest and most lawless public housing estate in Europe. The taxi driver, reluctantly taking us there, isn't pleased. He is charging us 'treble' and doesn't tire of telling us, spitting out the demand at each traffic light between puffs of his cigarette. </p> <p>Scampia is home of the infamous public housing towers known as Le Vele (the Sails), the place where Naples's many drug addicts come to score the cheapest high-grade heroin and crack cocaine in the EU. A land of outsiders and lawbreakers living on the fringes of society, the district is also home to the majority of the city's Roma. At the municipal entrance to the estate, with a nod to Dante's Inferno, someone with a canister of red spray paint has written: 'Abandon hope all ye who enter here.' </p> <p>Our first sight is a string of burnt-out cars. It looks and feels like the Farza district of Kabul. The buildings appear as if they've been beset by a natural disaster. The elevators in most are gone. Broken pipes spew water everywhere and the forecourts are covered with knee-deep garbage. The air outside smells of burning tyres. From the drab high-rise flats, conspicuous lookouts scan the roads for undercover police or special drug enforcement teams. Scampia has long been a key base for the narcotics arm of the Camorra.</p> <p>Our driver drops us in the middle of Via Cupa Perillo alongside the carcass of a Fiat Punto. It marks the entrance to Campo Autorizzato, Scampia's only official Roma camp - a couple of hundred caravans and prefabs strung on a narrow spit of land overshadowed by the high walls of Naples's notorious Carcere Di Secondigliano prison. It is the place where Cristina and Violetta were born and lived all their lives.</p> <p>'This is a reclaimed swamp,' says Francesca. 'Some 700 Roma live here without running water, toilets, sewers, garbage disposal or proper heating and cooking facilities.' </p> <p>As we approach the entrance, children play beside a polluted creek amid excrement spewed by an open-air communal toilet. Standing waiting for us in the centre of the roughshod tarmac road is Miriana Djeordsevic, the mother of the two dead girls. Shrouded in black with thin silk slippers on her feet, she is clutching the last photograph of her dead daughters. The mood around her is tense. In the days since the girls died, Miriana's extended family have been forced to give their fingerprints to the authorities. In recent weeks, Roma groups from here have demonstrated, wearing the black triangles Gypsies were forced to wear in the concentration camps.</p> <p>Inside Miriana's home, vodka is offered, poured by a tattooed man covered in gold chains and bracelets. Grinning through blackened teeth he offers no introduction. Most of the Roma women from this camp work as day labourers in agriculture, others, the elderly and the children, beg. But some of the men run one of the biggest car theft and stripping-down rackets in southern Italy. Others, living deeper in the shadows, earn their money from selling drugs and violence. Looking around the room it is clear this black economy does not produce wellbeing or health or luxury, only symbols of power, wealth and social advancement among the men. Their half-naked infants and wives look as unhealthy as some women and children in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>'The girls drowned in the sea,' Miriana tells me firmly. 'There has been talk in the newspapers, lies, that they were murdered, that there was no postmortem. They drowned in the sea, playing like the innocents they were. The real crime was what happened around them. Those people by the water, they ignored the children, like they were dead dogs washed up in the Mediterranean. My daughters were not subhuman.' </p> <p>Miriana hands me another photograph of Violetta. She is posing in a ruffled pink dress. 'She wanted to be a dancer. She didn't want to go to school. She only wanted to be beautiful. Cristina was a bad influence on Violetta. She didn't like school. She hated living in the camp. Her grandmother said she was just trying to find her place somewhere, but she would've grown into a strong woman. She had the will and the determination. Above all she wanted to be able to walk into the shops in the city, look at the dresses without being chased by the police. She would cut dresses out of magazines and place a cut-out of her head on to them. It was her way of escaping. Violetta just watched. She worshipped her big sister.</p> <p>'In the days after the girls died a Catholic priest visited us and apologised for the local people on the beach, who he said had misunderstood the situation. I asked him why the Italians hated us, why they looked at the bodies of two dead children and smeared on sun cream and he had no answers. He wept and told me the Roma were still God's children. I told him it doesn't feel like it. We are the ones the Italians blame for the poverty outside the camp. That is their own making, not ours, not my children's fault.'</p> <p>Miriana is barely 30 but looks a decade older. Married at 14 and a mother of five by her early twenties, she escaped the Bosnian-Serbian border area as a teenager, hoping for a new life in Italy. All three of her surviving children are unschooled. The youngest don't have birth certificates. They simply don't exist and she wants to keep it that away. One of the last things Cristina and Violetta did was to be fingerprinted by the authorities. 'Cristina and Violetta gave their fingerprints shortly before they died. Violetta was upset. She ran away and started crying. She thought the police were coming to take her away. Cristina was angry and scrubbed the ink from her thumb. She understood everything. She knew we were being treated like animals. She died knowing she had no real hope of a better life.' </p> <p>Later, as we walk around the camp, we are faced down with intimidating glares. One man spits at my feet. The ethnic fingerprinting drive, part of a broader crackdown on Italy's 3.5m recent economic immigrants and carried out in an atmosphere of hysterical rhetoric about crime and security, has left the Roma more bitter than ever. Catholic human rights organisations have damned the fingerprinting of Gypsies as 'evoking painful memories' of the Nazi persecution. The chief rabbi of Rome insisted this week that it 'must be stopped now'. Amos Luzzatto, former head of the Italian Union of Jewish Communities, said that the policy of fingerprinting recalled 'days when I could not go to school, and people would point at me saying: \"Look Mummy, it's a Jew.\" This is a country that has lost its memory.' </p> <p>But Massimo Barra, head of the Italian Red Cross, which has been monitoring the process, insisted last week that the aim was to integrate Roma people into Italian society. If children were fingerprinted, it would be done 'as a game', he said. 'We are building bridges, not walls.' </p> <p>Officially, the reasons for the fingerprinting programme appear simple enough: to allow the government to compile accurate census data and ensure that Gypsy children go to school. But human rights groups are concerned. As part of sweeping anti-immigration measures the prime minister has also appointed special commissioners to 'deal' with Gypsies in the three major Italian cities - Naples, Milan and Rome. </p> <p>According to Francesca Saudino, fingerprinting lies at the heart of the anguish and disenchantment felt by the Roma. 'The Italian right blames much of the country's street crime on the Roma, in particular on children sent out by adults to rob and steal,' she said. 'This is an hysterical inaccuracy. There are an estimated 152,000 Roma in 700 camps across Italy and the Interior Ministry hopes to dismantle them all. Thirty per cent have Italian citizenship, but the rest are immigrants, many from Romania and the Balkans. We suspect that the Gypsies are being identified only so that they can be expelled.' </p> <p>She added: 'A third of Neapolitan children don't go to school at all or have to repeat years. Illiteracy here is at Third World levels. The children who live on the outskirts of Naples, in the Spanish quarters and in Piscinola, San Giovanni a Teduccio, Poggioreale, Secondigliano and Torre del Greco, they are all the same, they hate school, their teachers and the selectivity of the system. They hate Italy and the Italians, too. Many are the children of Russian immigrants, but they are not fingerprinted or treated as outlaws. You cannot have one law for the Roma and one law for everyone else.'</p> <p>At the core of the issue, according to human rights groups, are several key politicians. One of them is Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League, a small party of restyled former Fascists, anti-immigrant forces and traditional conservatives. Bossi has emerged as Italy's kingmaker, the power player who was key in returning Silvio Berlusconi to office in the recent elections and who many believe will continue to call the shots. Bossi and three other members of his party were given choice seats in the new cabinet, including control of the Interior Ministry, which oversees police and most domestic security. Bossi is a man who once advocated shooting at boats bringing immigrants to Italy's shores. </p> <p>The Northern League emerged in the early Nineties as a party advocating the secession of Italy's wealthier north from the rest of the country. The party these days has toned down the secession rhetoric. Instead, it campaigns for more autonomy and 'devolution' of central government powers to regional authorities. Bossi was named Minister for Reforms in the new government, an ideal platform for changing the law to give more autonomy to the north.</p> <p>Another cabinet post went to the Northern League's colourful Roberto Calderoli, best remembered for appearing on TV in a T-shirt emblazoned with a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad, and for planning to parade pigs on land where Muslims were attempting to build mosques. Berlusconi's other main partner in government is the National Alliance, a party formed as a successor to Mussolini's Fascists. Its leader, Gianfranco Fini, who has struggled to distance himself from his neofascist past, became speaker of the lower chamber of parliament.</p> <p>Yet Giuliano Ferrara, formerly Berlusconi's media spokesman and now a prominent editor and TV pundit, claims the rise of the right is a myth. 'It was entirely predictable that once Berlusconi returned to power a Greek chorus would appear to warn us all that Italian democracy is in danger, that Italy is introducing mass deportations and concentration camps,' he said. 'In reality, violence against immigrants and Gypsies has been limited.' The true problem, Ferrara says, is that Italy, more than any other country in Europe, has had to cope with an influx of immigrants who end up living in poverty on the edges of cities - the very margins in which Italy's own poorest people live. 'There is no ethnic persecution in Italy,' Ferrara insists. 'To draw broad comparisons with what happened to the Jews, who were exterminated, is irresponsible.'</p> <p>Ironically, Europe is supposedly in the middle of a 'Decade of Roma Inclusion', a \u20ac30bn project launched by the EU in 2005 when the governments of the countries with the largest Roma populations - Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia - agreed to close the gap in education, employment, health and housing. Ask the Gypsies themselves and they will tell you it has had little effect on their lives. As the Open Society Institute, funded by billionaire George Soros, who has widely supported the Roma, said in a recent report, most governments see the answer to the Roma problem in terms of 'sporadic measures' rather than coherent policies. When asked what lay at the heart of the problem, one MEP said: 'Look. We want to help them. We don't lack the laws and we don't lack the money. The problem is political will in countries like Italy and, ultimately, the Roma themselves - many don't want to be part of society, even if society is trying to help them. There is no trust, only bitterness and scepticism. In the case of Italy, it is on both sides.'</p> <p>'My name is Veronica Selimovic and I am Italian,' cries the barefoot Gypsy child as she skips nimbly through mud and oil-slicked puddles at Camp Nomadi Aurelia on the outskirts of Rome. Young men stand among graveyards of wrecked cars and rusting bodywork, smoking smuggled cigarettes. All around us are burnt tyres, cartridge cases, condoms. The Gypsies are restless. They look prepared to leave in the dead of night; they claim it is with good reason. The political figure now presiding over their camp is the National Alliance's Gianni Alemanno, who was elected mayor of Rome in April. As he took office his supporters gave the Fascist salute, chanting 'Duce, Duce'.</p> <p>Clutching a black and white photograph of her father, 60-year-old Satka Selimovic's glaucomic eyes water and droop as she recalls her life on the fringes of Italian society. 'I was born in Italy, on the outskirts of Venice, after the Second World War. My family thought life would offer us a second chance. I told this to my own children, that life would turn out to be better and they say this to my granddaughter, Veronica. People may say we are bitter and to blame for our own isolation, but we tell each new generation of Roma they will be included and accepted and each time it feels like a betrayal.'</p>",
  "<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/012496.html\">US census bureau</a>, white Americans will no longer make up the majority of the US population by 2042, eight years earlier than previous projection, made in 2004, had anticipated. Although this had made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/15/population.race\">headlines around the world</a>, I'm still trying to figure what the <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-censusaug14,0,2584897.story\">fuss</a> is about. </p> <p>Besides stoking up fears about immigration and race, why does \u2013 or should - this matter? America is a nation of immigrants, and has been since the 16th century. So-called white Americans \u2013 now loosely defined as descendants of \"the original peoples of Europe, North Africa or the Middle East\" - came to America as immigrants, virtually wiping out the original Native American population. </p> <p>Since a government agency has put this information out, it leaves everyone else to ask the questions. The biggest one of these, of course, is \"What will this mean for America?\" - with the not-so-subtle subtext behind the headlines suggesting that this change in demography is somehow a cause for concern. </p> <p>However, states such as Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Texas that already have majority-minority populations seem to be doing just fine. Many other parts of America, such as the District of Columbia and cities like Atlanta, also have sizeable or majority African Americans populations. </p> <p>Those who fear that increasing numbers of minorities will be the downfall of America need not worry. Although minority cultures have certainly impacted upon America in many ways \u2013 food, language, music, culture \u2013 they have still continued to integrate into the dominant English-speaking American culture.</p> <p>Only a couple of months ago, I moved to a part of Harlem which is predominantly Latin American. Many of my local restaurants serve Cuban, Dominican or Mexican food and the waiting staff speak only Spanish. The corner stores (for which we all, regardless of colour, tend to use the Spanish word <em>bodega</em>) are generally bi-lingual. Aside from the fact that my Spanish is a little rusty, I have no problem with this. It has not led to a societal breakdown or ethnic war. In fact, my neighbourhood is pretty nice, made all the more interesting by this facet. </p> <p>There are more troubling issues at hand here \u2013 and they are not to do with the changing face of America. For a start, the fact that this information has been released now - in the middle of a major election cycle in which race is such an issue - is suspicious. No doubt right-wingers will use this as evidence of the need for tougher immigration policies and kick these figures around as a political football.</p> <p>Secondly, the headline is deeply misleading. According to the figures, in 2042 white people will make up 46% of the population, while Hispanics will make up 30%, African Americans 15% and Asians around 9%. This means therefore that at 46% white people will still be the largest single racial group in America. Besides a drop in numbers, they will still represent the majority and continue to exert cultural dominance. </p> <p>This research, significantly, only serves to highlight the fact that definitions of race are so superficial and politically constructed as to be almost meaningless. Maybe by 2042, the American government will have realized that its current racial definitions are not only inadequate to describe the diversity of people within its nation but that, considering the mixed genealogy of people in America, such racial categorization is also pretty futile. </p> <p>The very definition of \"white\" is questionable and I assume that when the US census bureau talks about white people, what they really mean is people of pale skin tone. Nowadays, fewer and fewer white Americans can trace their roots back to Europe alone, and - according to <a href=\"http://backintyme.com/essays/?p=5\">various studies</a> - a third of white Americans have between 2% and 20% African genes.</p> <p>As well, \"Hispanic\" is not even a race, and encompasses such a broad range of colours, nationalities and gene pools that you have people who are white, black and everything in between. Indeed, from just physical attributes alone, many white Hispanics would \u2013 and do - fit into the \"white American\" category anyway. Interestingly enough, the US government's <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68188.htm\">definition of Hispanic</a> also includes people of \"other Spanish culture\" which is hard to separate from the European definition required for identification as white American. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.csuchico.edu/cjhp/5/sp/009-023-kittles.pdf\">research</a> [PDF] conducted by the University of Chicago, \"over 30% of African-Americans paternal lineages are of European ancestry\". </p> <p>Therefore, considering the mixed nature of people in America, it is arguable that any immigrant race has ever truly been a majority. Furthermore, the political nature of racial categorization is such that should any categories change, or people decide to change their racial self-definition, it can tip the balance in a totally different direction, literally overnight. </p> <p>Although the government is using race as the measure, it seems what is being alluded to is really a change in culture, with the inaccurate conjecture being that an increase in minorities will not only change how America looks but what it stands for and the values it upholds.</p> <p>The release of this data would have been far more interesting, newsworthy and beneficial if the focus had been, for example, the impact of an extra 134 million people in America by 2050 - considering that America is already the world's largest polluter. Another useful question is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/business/2008/08/14/census-population-aging-biz-beltway-cx_jz_0813aging.html\">how the US social security system will cope</a> with a population of over 19 million 85-year-olds - triple the size of what it is now.</p> <p>The census bureau collects important and much-needed information that helps us to understand the country in which we live. Focussing on America's racial composition, either today or in the future, does little or nothing to aid that understanding at all.</p>",
  "<p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, has signed a ceasfire pact brokered by the French to end hostilities in Georgia.</p> <p>George Bush today said the development was \"a hopeful step,\" but added: \"Now Russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations.\"</p> <p>Foreign secretary David Miliband welcomed the declaration but added that Russian \"aggression\" against Georgia and threats to neighbouring states, such as Poland, were unacceptable.</p> <p>The Russians had been refusing to pull back their forces in Georgia until Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili signed the six-point ceasefire plan arranged by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France earlier this week -although they had refused to sign it themselves.</p> <p>Saakashvili reluctantly signed the plan yesterday \u2013 which calls for Russian troops to pull back but also grants them limited patrols inside Georgia, while accusing the Russians of being \"evil\" and \"21st century barbarians\".</p> <p>Kremlin sources have now confirmed that Russia has signed the pact.</p> <p>\"The president informed participants of the security council meeting that </p> <p>he had just now signed the six-point plan,\" said the Kremlin's chief </p> <p>spokeswoman, Natalia Timakova.</p> <p>Under the plan, some emotive issues remain open to interpretation \u2013 including whether Georgia is able to send troops back into areas of South Ossetia.</p> <p>The ceasefire agreement should prompt international talks to define the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the risk of a new era of east-west confrontation triggered by Russia's invasion of Georgia heightened yesterday when Moscow reserved the right to launch a nuclear attack on Poland because it agreed to host US rockets as part of the Pentagon's missile shield.</p> <p>Miliband welcomed Medvedev's signing of the peace plan and said the priority was to ensure that commitments made in the agreement were \"speedily and fully implemented\".</p> <p>Earlier, Washington accused Russia of \"bullying and intimidation\" in Georgia, Russia's deputy chief of staff turned on Warsaw and said it was vulnerable to a Russian rocket attack because of Thursday's pact with the US on the missile defence project.</p> <p>\"By deploying, Poland is exposing itself to a strike - 100%,\" warned Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn. He added that Russia's security doctrine allowed it to use nuclear weapons against an active ally of a nuclear power such as America.</p> <p>The warning worsened the already dismal mood in relations between Moscow and the west caused by the shock of post-Soviet Russia's first invasion of a foreign country.</p> <p>There were scant signs of military activity on the ground in Georgia, but nor were there any signs of the Russian withdrawal pledged on Tuesday under ceasefire terms mediated by the European Union.</p> <p>Instead, the focus was on a flurry of diplomatic activity that exposed acute differences on how Washington and Berlin see the crisis in the Caucasus.</p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, went to Tbilisi to bolster Georgia against the Russians as President George Bush denounced Russian \"bullying and intimidation\" as \"unacceptable\".</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, met Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev on the Black Sea close to Georgia's borders and sent quite a different message, offering a mild rebuke of Moscow.</p> <p>\"Some of Russia's actions were not proportionate,\" she said.</p> <p>Unlike the Americans and some European states who are saying the Russians should face \"consequences\" for their invasion, Merkel said negotiations with Moscow on a whole range of issues would continue as before and spread the blame for the conflict. \"It is rare that all the blame is on one side. In fact, both sides are probably to blame. That is very important to understand,\" she said.</p> <p>In Tbilisi, Rice was much more forthright, saying that the invasion had \"profound implications for Russia ... This calls into question what role Russia really plans to play in international politics.</p> <p>\"You can't be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours.\"</p> <p>Saakashvili said: \"Russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west. It's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere,\" said Saakashvili. \"We are looking evil directly in the eye. Today this evil is very strong, and very dangerous for everybody, not just for us.\"</p> <p>Rice's show of solidarity with Georgia's beleaguered president was theatrically undermined when Russia dispatched a column of armoured personnel carriers towards the Georgian capital.</p> <p>As the talks were taking place, 10 armoured personnel carriers laden with Russian troops set off from Gori, penetrating to within 20 miles of Tbilisi.</p> <p>\"Georgia has been attacked. Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once,\" said Rice. The withdrawal \"must take place, and take place now ... This is no longer 1968,\" she added in reference to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago next week.</p> <p>The ceasefire terms favour the Russians who routed the Georgians. But the secretary of state argued the plan would not affect negotiations over the central territorial dispute between Georgia and the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The deal allows Russian troops to remain in the two provinces and to mount patrols and \"take additional security measures\" on Georgian territory beyond the two enclaves.</p> <p>Senior Russians continued to insist yesterday that Russian troops had not stepped outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia despite the fact they have been deep inside Georgian territory in several places all week.</p> <p>\"Our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone,\" said Sergei Ivanov, the deputy prime minister.</p> <p>Moscow also indicated it would resist possible European attempts to deploy international peacekeepers in the contested territories.</p> <p>\"We are not against international peacekeepers,\" the Russian president said. \"But the problem is that the Abkhazians and the Ossetians do not trust anyone except Russian peacekeepers.\" He also attacked the agreement between Washington and Warsaw on the missile shield and said claims that the shield was aimed at Iran were \"fairy tales\"</p> <p>\"This clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti-missile forces in Europe has as its aim the Russian Federation,\" said Medvedev. \"The moment has been well chosen.\"</p> <p>The timing of Thursday's agreement on missile defence means that tensions are soaring on Russia's southern and western borders.</p> <p>Polish armed forces yesterday paraded in Warsaw to mark a rare defeat of the Russians 888 years ago and President Lech Kaczynski hailed the accord on the Pentagon project as a boost for Poland's security.</p> <p>In return for hosting 10 interceptor rockets said to be intended to destroy any eventual ballistic missile attacks from Iran, Poland is to receive a battery of US Patriot missiles for its air defences and has won a mutual security pact with Washington.</p>",

She may sneak through as a fastest loser.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>5.19am: </strong><strong>Badminton</strong> Maria Kristin Yulianti of Indonesia beat Lu Lan of China 11-21 21-13 21-15</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>5.21am: </strong>More bad news for China, Zhang Penghui has been disqualified from the Olympic <strong>men's 25m rapid fire pistol</strong> competition. The reason: he raised his arm to much on three occasions.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>5.27am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m </strong>Lee McConnell qualifies for the next round. She made it look very easy, a nice relaxed run.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>5.28am: </strong>Elena Isinbaeva makes <strong>Pole Vaulting</strong> look so easy; I'm even thinking about limbering up for London 2012. Meanwhile, Kate Dennison wasn't so impressive she failed to get over 4.50m, but that's her best outdoors this season.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>5.32am: </strong><strong>Women's 400m</strong> Christine Ohuruogu ran-down Yulia Gushchina to win her heat very easily.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>5.35am: </strong>I need some verification on a bit of pub quiz trivia. Is it true that the <strong>discus</strong> is the only event where the women's world record is better than the men's? Answers on a postcard please.....</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.40am: </strong>You know I mentioned the <strong>men's 25m rapid fire pistol</strong> well it's been won by Oleksandr Petriv (Ukraine) who scored 780.2 points.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.42am: </strong><strong>Sanya Richards</strong> is looking in ominous form. Don't forget she missed the World Championships last year. She made that race look like a gentle jog around Finsbury Park. No problems for <strong>Nicola Sanders</strong> either. Job done for the GB girls.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.49am: </strong>So my discus factoid is half true. Jim Graham says: \"The women's discuss is 1 kilo, compared to the men's, which is 2 kilos. The men's discuss is also bigger in circumference. So, the records really have no relation to one another.\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.53am: </strong>I can't believe it, with all the excitement in the pool and on the track I've totally forgotten about the <strong>softball</strong>. Japan v China and USA v Chinese Taipei. What the heck has happened? Also if anyone is watching any of the so-called \"smaller sports\" that the Beeb deems not worthy of coverage let me know.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>6.00am: </strong> It's been a big big morning. Here's what you missed out on. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics3\">Brilliant Adlington wins second gold</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics2\">Phelps wins seventh gold of the Beijing Games... just</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3\">Sotherton falls to fifth after failing to take off in the long jump</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/athletics.christineohuruogu\">British trio cruise through 400m opening round</a> and the '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/16/olympicsandthemedia.spain\">Affectionate gesture' that sparked a global storm</a>.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>6.08am: </strong> Our friend Andrew Jolley has come up with the goods again. Apparently Japan are beating China 3-0 in the softball and, for good measure, he's thrown in a volleyball score, Serbia are one set up and are also leading Germany 10-6 in the second.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>6.14am: </strong><strong>Softball </strong>update, Jim Graham says the USA are now 5-0 up against Chinese Taipei.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>6.27am: </strong>Andrew Jolley says: \"Japan did beat China in the softball 3-0, and Serbia have just taken the second set 27-25 against Germany in the best of 3 contest. It being 20 degrees in the middle of winter here in Brisbane, I'm off to get an ice-cream.\"<br><em>I want some ice-cream, although i'd probably settle for coffee and toast.</em></p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>6.30am: </strong>We're all missing a trick here, everyone one of us should have tuned in the trampolining. I didn't even realise it was an Olympic event. Apparently the athletes were stunned by the size of the crowd: \"We don't get anything like this at home,\" said Canada's Rosannagh MacLennan.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>6.35am:</strong> If beeb commentator Andy Jameson had his way, instead of shaking hands, we'd all go around saluting each other. I lost count of the times he demanded we all raise three fingers to our cranium during Rebecca Adlington's gold medal swim.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>6.38am: </strong>Never accuse me of not having my finger on the Olympic pulse. Australia have just beaten European Champions Russia in the men's basketball. The Russians could possibly be heading out of the competition. Bit of a shock. (Thanks Joanna).</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.46am: </strong> Bit of Brit interest for all <strong>flyweight</strong> Khalid Yafai takes on Andris Hernandez Laffita. Guess where he's from: Cuba. Oh dear that means he's bound to be good.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.49am: </strong> News from water polo. Germany have edged past Italy 8-7 and the USA have beaten Croatia 7-5. Did anybody watch? Were they good, bad or indifferent?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.54am: </strong> Andrew Jolley knows the Guardian website better than me, he's just pointed out this excellent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/interactive/2008/aug/16/beijingolympics2008\">guide to trampolining</a>.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.59am: </strong><strong> Boxing</strong>Khalid Yafai is getting a bit of a boxing lesson at the hands of the Cuban. How do they keep turning out such great fighters? Castro must be putting something in the water.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>7.01am: </strong><strong>Boxing </strong>Khalid Yafai has been beaten 9-3 by Andris Hernandez Laffita, another one of our boxers bites the dust.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>7.02am: </strong>Today isn't just Super Saturday at the Olympics, it's also the start of the Premiership season, and on that note, David Bartram says: \"Thank god the Premier League starts today. I've had enough of watching sportsmen from obscure nations outshining Brits. Oh wait...\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>7.07am: </strong><strong>Shooting </strong>Bad news for anyone thing of taking up the <strong>25-meter rapid-fire pistol</strong> for London 2012. Silver medalist Ralf Schumann won't be retiring any time soon. \"I will go to London (for the 2012 Olympics),\" he said. Schumann finished second behind Oleksandr Petriv of Ukraine.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>7.12am: </strong><strong>Injury update</strong> Germany defender Linda Bresonik is out of the Olympics after she tore an ankle ligament in the team's quarterfinal victory over Norway.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>7.15am: </strong><strong>Basketball</strong> Poor old Angola, Ioannis Bourousis scored 22 points as Greece thrashed them 102-61. They look to be on their way out.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>7.20am: </strong><strong>Another Chinese gold medal</strong> Defending champion Zhang Ning of China won the gold medal in women's singles in the Olympic badminton tournament Saturday, defeating team-mate Xie Xingfang in three sets. She won 21-12, 10-21, 21-18.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7.26am: </strong>Right that's me checking out of this mad house. Paolo Bandini is going to take you through the next few hours of action that will include: sailing, rowing and possibly some tennis. Right adios.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>7.33am:</strong> Hello. I'm watching a couple of <strong>very slow sailboats</strong> bobbing along gently on the water outside Qingdao. Ben Ainslie is apparently doing an \"excellent\" job of marking his only rival for the gold medal - America's Zach Railey. Which as far as I can discern means getting in Railey's way and copying <em>absolutely everything</em> he does. Ainslie needs to finish within six places of Railey to win gold, which doesn't look like it's going to be a problem, though it's early doors yet.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>7.38am:</strong> Let's look at the agenda for the next few hours, then, and it seems like I may have arrived just in time for ... er ... a bit of a lull. Ainslie is going now, of course, but other than him, there's no British medal chasing till 8.50am BST, when Alan Campbell is in the final of the men's single sculls. Lots of rowing finals in quick succession after that though, with the women's pair, women's double sculls, men's double sculls and men's coxless four all to be decided. We've also got James Degale up in the boxing at 9.15am, then the cycling gets going, with Chris Newton in the men's points race final at 10.40am and Bradley Wiggins chasing gold in the individual pursuit an hour and a quarter later.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>7.44am:</strong> \"It's golden Saturday,\" yelps a slightly overexcited Clare Balding as Ainslie maintains his comfortable domination of America's Railey in the Finn Class <strong>sailing</strong>. In the meantime let me know which you are most excited about out of the men's basketball preliminary between Croatia and Lithuania, the men's handball preliminary between France and Spain or the men's table tennis semi-final between Japan and Germany and I'll try to give you some bonus updates*.</p> <p>* theguardian.com reserves the right to ignore your views.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>7.51am:</strong> Gary Naylor's here, and he's quoting me. \"You say 'Ainslie needs to finish within six places of Railey to win gold, which doesn't look like it's going to be a problem' (7.33am). Do you mean it will be 'plain sailing'?\" You're better than that Gary.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>7.55am:</strong> Am I the only one who's marginally uncomfortable about the BBC's repeated insistence on referring to this as a \"golden day\" for Britain? I mean I do realise that the one medal we've won already is above par, and we <em>probably</em> will win a bunch more, but <em>really</em> - are we cocky enough about anything Olympic related to take winning medals for granted?</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.59am:</strong> \"Dramatic scenes!\" scream our commentary team as they cut to LIVE images of a small boat not moving. Apparently the Finn class medal race has been abandoned due to a lack of wind, meaning Ainslie, who basically had the gold in hand, now has to do it all over again. It could be later today, or it could be even later than that, depending on the weather.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>8.03am:</strong> This really isn't what I was asking for (at 7.44am) but Andrew Jolly seems intent on doing my job for me. \"I can cover the Lithuania v Croatia basketball and Australia v Holland in the women's hockey as that's all there is on offer on Australian TV this afternoon,\" he chimes. \"It's 1-1 in the hockey at the start of the 2nd half and Croatia 23-17 Lithuania in the basketball.\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>8.11am: It's a Golden Day!</strong> Nobody's won anything in the last eight minutes, but let's be honest, I was wrong at 7.44am, <strong>it is a golden day</strong> for Britain. We've been discussing this in the office, and we feel it may be necessary to play a little jingle every time Britain win gold. BBC's idents are already wearisome, while the national anthem and Spandau Ballet's Gold seem too obvious. Any other suggestions?</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>8.15am:</strong> \"I thought it was a golden day for Britain due to Hull City's first appearance in top flight football,\" pipes up Oliver Pattenden, moderately humorously.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>8.18am: rowing</strong> More good news for Britain - there's a lurgy going round the rowing regatta, and among the afflicted is German rower Marco Neumann, who has been forced to withdraw from the final of the men's four. Given that they Germany were among the favourites, this can <em>only</em> mean more gold for Britain. Probably.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>8.23am</strong> \"Yup, talking up the Golden Day can only end in tears,\" reckons Andrew Jolly. \"I know this because there have been a whole host of Australian swimmers who were meant to 'cruise home' in gold. They've been performing quite under par, which is of course, amusing, and provides me and others with much ammo for the office. They are of course, still miles ahead in the table.\" Pah - they're only one gold ahead. We'll be in front before elevenses ...</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>8.26am: sailing</strong> The guardian's man in Qingdao Steve Bierley says there's still some prospect of more wind later today, so there's a decent chance Ben Ainslie will get another shot at tying up his gold this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>8.31am:</strong> New Zealand-based British rowing enthusiast Joanne Harris has more good news for team GB ... \"TVNZ is also treating today as a possible golden day, because there's the rowing and the cycling and Valerie Vili appears to be on good form in the shot put,\" she says. \"Basically NZ is now desperate to get on the medals table full stop. But Mahe Drysdale's got a funny tummy and is dehydrated, so that might not help the chances and Vili's the best bet at the moment.\" Drysdale's got a dicky tummy too, eh? That pretty much <em>guarantees</em> Britain's Alan Campbell gold in the men's single sculls.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>8.35am:</strong> \"But what happened in the <strong>trampolining</strong>,\" demands Frances Bentley. Britain's Claire Wright failed to qualify for the final of the women's competition, that's what.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>8.42am:</strong> Enough dawdling, it's time for facts. <br>\u2022Fact No1: The United States have whupped Taiwan 7-0 in a rounders preliminary.<br>\u2022Fact No2: Holland have crushed Australia 2-1 in the women's hockey. \"Apparently it was the crowd's fault,\" relays Andrew Jolly.<br>\u2022Fact No3: Rebecca Adlington is going to get an open-top bus tour around Mansfield to celebrate her two gold medals when she gets home. \"She has raised the profile of Mansfield and provides inspiration for other youngsters in the town,\" hurrahed the Mayor of Mansfield, Tony Egginton.<br>\u2022Fact No4: You really should read <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/do_we_really_have_to_learn_les.html\">Barney Ronay's blog asking whether we really need to learn lessons</a>, because it's rather good.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>8.48am:</strong> The men's single sculls is literally just 120 seconds away. I've just been informed that Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the Bird's Nest on all the big athletics - including the men's 100m final - from 1pm BST.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>8.51am: Whinging ... erm ... Kiwis</strong> There's been a delay after Drysdale complained that there was weed in his lane and it had to be removed.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>8.53am:</strong> Campbell's started well and is in the lead after 500m, Tim Meyens of Belgium is second ...</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>8.55am:</strong> ... Campbell's down to second after 1000m though - Olympic champion and favourite Olaf Tufte, from Norway, has taken first ...</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>8.57am:</strong> ... But it's Drysdale who leads after 1500m - he's setting a serious pace now and is almost a whole length clear of Tufte in second. Campbell is barely clinging onto third ...</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> ... Yeah, Campbell's miles off the pace by the end and nowhere near the medals. His collapse was somewhat overshadowed by Drysdale, though, who seemed to go to pieces in the final 100m, when he went from leading comfortably to only just sneaking third. Tufte, who upped his stroke rate dramatically down the stretch, retains his Olympic title, while the Czech Republic's Ondrej Synek, who rowed a very patient race before also pushing on late, takes silver.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>9.02am: skeet shooting</strong> In amidst all that rowing excitement, I'm afraid I missed Vincent Hancock winning gold in the men's skeet shooting. Norway's Tore Brovold takes silver, and if I understand the official Beijing website right, then France's Anthony Terras got bronze.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>9.05am:</strong> \"Lithuania beat Croatia 86-73,\" relays Andrew Jolly. \"I don't normally like basketball, but I'll concede that this was quite good. The water polo, on the other hand, is utterly ridiculous as a spectator sport, just a load of hairy men splashing and spluttering all over the place.\"</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> \"Can we not be too hard on Alan Campbell,\" implores Joanne Harris as the women's pair get ready to go. \"He had a knee infection not that long ago and to reach the final was an achievement - also, Britain hasn't had a decent single sculler for quite some time, and Campbell's the baby of the men's singles field at the moment. He actually is a real prospect for 2012, as rowers can go on for some time (evidence: Steve Redgrave!)\" Indeed, quite an infection Joanne - he missed six weeks of training in the build-up to this Olympics. Joanne also rightly points out that Drysdale has had to receive treatment after collapsing in his boat.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>9.12am:</strong> You were probably hoping for some more <strong>rowing</strong> news here, but you're getting <strong>sailing</strong> instead. Sadly both Ben Ainslie and the Yngling girls will now have to wait for tomorrow for their tilt at gold, as it's all been called off for the day due to adverse weather conditions. Sailing, incidentally, must be the only sport in the world where a total absence of wind constitutes \"adverse weather conditions\".</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>9.15am:</strong> Britain's Louisa Reeve and Olivia Whitlam are pootling along in fifth at the half-way mark of the women's pair. To be fair they were never expected to do much here ...</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>9.20am:</strong> Reeve and Whitlam just about sneak past the support tugboat on the line, but only because it stopped. A comfortable last place for Britain, with Romania's Georgeta Andrunache and Viorica Susanu taking gold, and China's You Wu and Yulan Gao putting in a huge effort to power past Belarus's Yuliya Bichyk and Natallia Helakh for silver with less than 50m to go.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>9.27am:</strong> Australia has beaten Russia 95-80 in the men's basketball. That's the sort of news you came here to hear.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>9.30am: cycling</strong> Steven Burke is up against Ukraine's Volodymyr Dyudya in the first round of the men's individual pursuit ...</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>9.32am: cycling</strong> ... and so far he's getting hammered. Dyudya's about two and a half seconds ahead ...</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>9.34am: cycling</strong> ... but Burke comes storming back - the gap's down to just over 0.1sec with one lap to go ...</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>9.35am: cycling</strong> ... and Burke's through to the last four with what I'm told is a personal best time. Brilliant stuff, and if Bradley Wiggins can do the same in his heat against Alexander Serov shortly, then Britain will be guaranteed at least one medal in the competition ...</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>9.39am:</strong> Debra Lee has composed a gold medal jingle to go with Team GB's <strong>golden day (number of gold medals won so far: 1)</strong>. \"Bill Withers may be 80 but I'm sure he's up for re-recording Lovely Day with revised lyrics,\" she offers - before launching into song: <br>\"Then I check results and the world's alright with me<br>Just who's won the gold, oh, I see it's Team GB -<br>A golden daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay<br>(Golden day, golden day, golden day, golden)<br>A golden daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay\"</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>9.42am:</strong> I've just had a request for an update on that men's table tennis, and I can tell you that Germany are currently 2-1 up in matches against Japan, with Christian Suss beating Yo Kan 1-0 in games and 8-5 in the second game of the fourth match as I type.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>9.47am: rowing</strong> Australia's Drew Ginn and Duncan Free have taken gold in the men's coxless pair. There were no Brits in the final, so no more crushing disappointment just yet.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>9.47am: boxing</strong> James Degale is through to the quarter-finals of the men's middleweight tournament after beating USA's Shawn Estrada 11-5 on points. He'll face Kazakhstan's Bakhtiyar Artayev next.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9.52am: rowing</strong> And now we have Elise Laverick and Anna Bebington in the final of the women's double sculls. They're fourth and three seconds back on leaders Germany at the half-way mark. In fact they're apparently in \"fourth medal\" position according to the Beeb's commentators. What do we reckon that particular medal's made of, cheese (hard variety)?</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>9.57am: rowing</strong> ... the girls are still three seconds back but now third at the 1,500m mark ...</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>9.59am: rowing</strong> ... Aah - a frustrating <strong>bronze medal</strong> for Britain in the end - they battled right back into it, and had the race gone on another 50m probably would have won, but in the end were only about three feet back of Germany and New Zealand, who crossed the line at almost exactly the same moment. As yet we still don't know who actually won as it was too tight to call ...</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>10.01am: rowing</strong> New Zealand's Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell are deemed to have won by a hundredth of a second, meaning their first gold of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>10.04am: cycling</strong> Meanwhile, Bradley Wiggins has beaten Serov in the individual pursuit. His time was the fastest in any of the four heats, so he will face New Zealand's Hayden Roulston, whose heat time was three seconds slower than his own, in the heats. Wiggins was 12-1 on favourite before this morning and he should fancy his chances now. Steven Burke's time was the third-fastest in the end, so he will face Russia's Alexei Markov in the bronze medal race.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>10.06am: cycling</strong> Chris Hoy has cruised through his heat in the men's keirin.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>10.10am: rowing</strong> We're back at the Shunyi rowing lake, where Matthew Wells and Stephen Rowbotham have a reasonable shot for gold in the men's double sculls</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>10.13am: rowing</strong> are second at the half-way mark, but Australia are pulling away and have already created clear water between themselves and the British crew ...</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>10.15am: rowing</strong> ... Australia's still have a gap of over two and a half seconds at 1,500m and I'd the Brits are looking more likely to lose silver - probably to Estonia - than gain gold ...</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>10.17am: rowing</strong> ... They say second place is first loser, which would make our crew second losers, I guess, as they are overhauled by Estonia right on the line. Yup, the golden day is going much as we expected.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>10.24am:</strong> \"So far the only golds the Aussies have won have been in the swimming and rowing,\" points out Bob O'Hara. \"It's almost as if they're desperately trying to get off their large island ... I hope they don't discover sailing.\" Meanwhile Britain's Ross Edgar has qualified from his heat in the men's <strong>keirin</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>10.30am:</strong> \"Bolt's going to run 9.5sec today,\" insists my colleague James Dart and 100m chitter-chatter has been dominating the desk all morning. Personally I still believe Tyrone Edgar's in with a shout*.</p> <p>* I do NOT believe this.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>10.32am: rowing</strong> Right then, one last crack at gold on the Shunyi lake. Great Britain are second at the 500m mark in the men's fours ...</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>10.34am: rowing</strong> ... Team GB are third and about 1.4sec behind Australia at the half-way point. This is where Britain would expect to start kicking on ...</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>10.35am: rowing</strong> ... still second at the 1,500m mark but the gap isn't closing so far ...</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>10.37am: rowing</strong> GOLD FOR BRITAIN! Raise your glasses, do a dance, play a jingle - Debra Lee's at 9.39am will do - the <strong>golden day</strong> is finally back on as Tom James, Andy Hodge, Pete Reed and Steve Williams heave their way past the Australians with 100m to spare.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>10.41am: rowing</strong> Take that Russia! A fifth gold medal elevates Britain in the table from lowly ninth to a lofty eighth, leaving the Russians trailing in their wake. \"What's impressive is how the rowing coaches ride bikes along the towpath to observe the crews,\" parps Gary Naylor,\" yet, despite being close together and staring at boats and stopwatches instead of the road ahead, never collide nor, alas, ride into the lake.\" Those riders came up last time I was on MBM duty too, and I think we established there are some fans in that mix too - apparently they've been hiring out bikes for free by the rowing lake. Which I guess isn't so much hiring them out as giving them away, when you think about it.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>10.48am</strong> How long does it take to give out a medal? Wells and Rowbotham are only just getting theirs, and they finished half an hour ago.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>10.50am: cycling</strong> OK, maybe I can stop being facetious about the gold rush now - we've got an all-British final coming up in the women's 3000m individual pursuit after Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero posted the two fastest times in the heats.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>10.58am: cycling</strong> A few of you have emailed in to express concerns over the moped that leads the cyclists out on the first few laps of the keirin. Gary Naylor reminds us of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbwYLaJo0zs\">Alan Partridge's stringent views on this sort of cheating</a>.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>11.08am: cycling</strong> Right, we've got the men's points race starting any moment now, where Britain's Chris Newton is up for a medal, but in the meantime I have <strong>huge news from the men's team table tennis</strong>, where Germany are through to the final after beating Japan 3-2. Judging by the footage on Eurosport, they're pretty happy about it too.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>11.13am:</strong> Brazil just kicked off against Cameroon in the quarter-finals of the <strong>men's football</strong> and likewise Italy against Belgium. No goals in either as yet.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>11.16am: cycling</strong> \"Good luck with the points race,\" offers Gary Naylor. \"I've watched a lot of bike racing, but I still have no idea what's happening.\" Oh, it's perfectly straightforward Gary. Basically they all pedal round this here velodrome, and they get points for ... er ... yes. America's Bobby Lea just did a full lap more than everyone and rejoined the main group, and therefore has 25 points. Britain's Chris Newton has two. Just 133 laps to go.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>11.21am: tennis</strong> The Williams sisters are a set down to the Ukraine's Bondarenko sisters in the women's doubles, but 4-2 up in the second set. Russia's Dinara Safina, meanwhile, has beaten China's Na Li in the women's singles, and will face compatriot Elena Dementieva, who beat another Russian - Vera Zvonareva - in the other semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>11.28am: cycling</strong> Yup, just 100 laps to go in the points race and \"it's going to be very close\". This seems as good a time as any to make my excuses and leave, so here's Taimour Lay to carry you through to 1pm, after which Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the Bird's Nest. Thanks for all your emails.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>11.33am:</strong> Right, that's quite enough of Bandini's knee-jerk patriotism. Here's to an afternoon of British underachievement and detached cynicism.</p> <p>By the way, the men's points race is continuing on its merrily incomprehensible way. A shiny penny to anyone who emails in to explain the rules.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>11.36am: Football</strong> Exciting things are happening in the quarter-final between Italy and Belgium. But I only know what John in Singapore tells me: ''It's now 1-1 with Belgium down to ten men after giving away a penalty. Italy scored to make it 1-0 but then belgium equalised with a very, very controversial header from a corner. It was cleared off the line but the ref said it went over. Very dodgy indeed.''</p> <p>Back to the compelling cycling on the BBC! Only 60 laps to go...</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>11.39am:</strong> Roy Keane emails from New Zealand with a not unreasonable question which I, erm, can't answer. ''How does a rider end up in negative points in this men's points race?'' Anyone?</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>11.41am: Team GB Cycling</strong> Chris Newton is in a bronze medal position with 40-odd laps left. That much I know.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>11.43am: Things coming up </strong> Steven Burke is on next in the men's 4000m individual pursuit bronze medal race, with Bradley Wiggins in the gold race afterwards.</p> <p>The keirin second round, with Chris Hoy, is after the points race with the final at 12.20pm.</p> <p>The javelin round of the <strong>heptathlon</strong> starts at midday. Watch amazed as Kelly Sotherton sends the pointy stick <em>backwards</em> into the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>11.45am: </strong> <strong>The points race explained.</strong> Andrew Jolly wonders what all the fuss is about. ''It's pretty simple. There are a load of laps, every 10 laps there is a sprint, where they give 5 points for the bike across the line first, down to 1 for 5th. If you go all the way around and catch the back of the pack, you get 20 points. The bloke with the most points wins.'' </p> <p>And, Roy, here's an answer to the negative points question. Again, from Mr Jolly. ''You get 20 points taken away if you drop a lap from the leaders.''</p> <p>I feel pretty small right now.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Newton is in second! </strong>(check out that exclamation mark as my own knee-jerk patriotism kicks in.....)</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>11.49am: Football Football Football </strong> Italy are getting STUFFED by Belgium. Well, not stuffed. But, read on:</p> <p>''The Belgians are in dreamland according to the commentator,'' says John in Singapore. ''And why not? They've just gone 2-1 up in injury time at the end of the first half. I won't pretend to know who scored, mind you.''</p> <p>I have the full weight of the Guardian sports department behind me. I'll find that Belgian scorer.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>11.50am: None of us know the scorer.</strong></p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>11.53am: </strong>Former Bluebells bassist Lawrence Donegan will be <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/athletics_live.html\">blogging live from the bird's nest</a> in Beijing from 1pm: follow all the athletics, including the men's 100m at 3.30pm.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>11.55am: Team GB Cycling Bronze to Chris Newton </strong> Fair enough.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>11.59am: Chinese Pop-aganda: </strong> Want to hear the Olympic song that is sending <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/cctv_quickly_wears_out_its_wel.html\">Marina Hyde around the Beijing bend</a>? </p> <p>Well, I played it (for research purposes, you understand) before work this morning, fully prepared to reject its saccharine manipulation, but then ended up humming it all the way to Farringdon, a spring in my step, the Olympic spirit coursing through my veins. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XbIZqg4v7w\">Try it if you dare. </a></p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>12.01pm: </strong>''The Belgian who scored was Kevin Mirallas!'' emails an excited Joanna Sutherland. We are a global village. And I am the idiot.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>12.04pm: Team GB Keirin</strong> Chris Hoy is into the final.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>12.07pm: </strong> Andy Bull gets all <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/time_for_new_heroes_as_british.html\">voyeuristic at the rowing.</a></p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>12.12pm: Sotherton watch</strong> Kelly starts her javelin. She's 22 points off bronze in the heptathlon. This is her worst event. And it's ... a no throw! At least, that's what I think a cross and a red flag indicate. Not a great beginning. Just hurl it! Any old way will do.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> Another email from Joanna who obviously has a laptop and a budding ambition to take all our jobs: ''I'm writing from the Basketball arena in Beijing and coming up next is China v Germany (whoever loses is out of the competition - the locals are VERY nervous) followed by USA (USA!) v world champions Spain. It's a biggie and the venue is full of bloody media!''</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>12.17am: Team GB Keirin</strong> Ros Edgar makes the final too. Bandini can't control himself and bellows ''GB Gold rush!'' across the newsroom. <strong>Britain</strong>. Is. <strong>Great</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>12.19am: Football</strong> Brazil v Cameroon. ''It's 0-0, nearly 60 minutes gone and it's not a great game,'' reports Andrew Jolly. And Cameroon are down to 10 men.</p> <p>''Does anyone care about Italy v Belgium?'' asks Singapore John. ''If they do they might like to know Rossi, the fella that used to play for Man Utd, just got booked for diving in the box when the keeper clearly had enough of his ankle to make you think he was trying to rob his boots. I can imagine some serious whining from the Italians if they lose this.''</p> <p>Some-time Italian Paolo Bandini applauds the dive: ''A pragmatic solution to a hopeless situation.''</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>12.23pm: Team GB </strong> Newton is on the podium for his bronze. Joan Llaneras of Spain got gold in that points race by the way.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>12.25pm: Tennis</strong> Novak Djokovic has won the first set 6-3 against James Blake. The winner takes the bronze medal.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>12.26pm:</strong> <strong>Sotherton throws a javelin!</strong> She made a celebratory gesture just now that suggests it went forwards - as is the aim of the discipline.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>12.28pm: Team GB Cycling</strong> It's the individual men's pursuit. Stephen Burke is up against Alexei Markov of Russia for the bronze medal.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>12.30pm: Team GB Burke </strong> Markov is ahead. The 20 year-old from Lancashire needs to, er, pump those legs faster so that the bike moves quicker and so on.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.32pm: Cycling </strong> Burke is go! He's ahead.</p> <p>In her <strong>800m semi-final</strong>, Marilyn Okoro finishes 6th. Will that be enough to qualify?</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>12.34pm:</strong> <strong>Bronze rush!</strong> Stephen Burke has won it. 4.20.947 is the time.</p> <p>And Bradley Wiggins is next in the gold medal race against the Kiwi Hayden Roulston. They're off.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> Wiggins looks like he's going to win it. He's 2 seconds clear.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong><strong>12.41pm:</strong> Team GB Gold Individual pursuit</strong> Belgian-born Wiggins is an Olympic winner once again.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>12.43pm: Team GB Athletics</strong> <strong>Rush of disappointment</strong> In the women's 800m semis, it looks like Marilyn Okoro's 6th place won't be enough to qualify for the final. In the second heat, Jenny Meadows also came sixth.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>12.45pm: Tennis</strong> In the battle of the siblings, Serena and Venus Williams are into the final of the women's doubles after beating Ukraine's Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko 4-6, 6-4, 6-1.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>12.47pm: Egad, I wish I was watching the football</strong> John fills us in: \"The Italians win a second penalty and, against Belgian's substitute<br>keeper, it's......scored by Rossi. 2-2 with 20 minutes to go. The ten of Italy men will not lie down! But then shocking keeping lets Dan Welly, or whatever he's called, score his second and it's 3-2 to Belgium. And the ref has sent off the Italian keeper. Miralis, the Belgian striker, ran off with the ball and then threw it behind him right into the keeper's head (tough to tell if he meant it or not) at which point the Italian keeper wrestled him to the ground and saw red. 10 minutes to go and it's a blinder!''</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>12.52pm: The obligatory softball update</strong> ''Having still not seen any of TEAM GBGBGB (say it fast enough and you get Bee Gees) in action in the velodrome courtesy of Australian State Television, I thought you might like to know the Aussie women's softball team have just beaten the Dutch.'' Thanks to Michelle Houtman, who claims to be ''suffering in Sydney''. From excitement?</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong><strong>12.54pm: </strong> Football </strong> Jolly intriguing: Cameroon hang on for extra time with 10 men against Brazil.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>12.57pm: The English Premier League begins - the world yawns?</strong> ''I was wondering if there was any indication of the Chinese organisers trying to overcome the fact that now the Premiership has started the Olympics will wither on the vine over here,'' writes Tom Stone. ''I am sure someone is still watching it but a quick walk down the street and a few cheeky glances into people's front rooms suggests that the majority of Brixton at least would rather watch Mark Lawrenson and Lee Dixon bickering over who will be relegated come May.''</p> <p>I wouldn't attempt cheeky glances at strangers in Brixton, Tom. That's brought me a lot of trouble in the past...</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>1.00pm:</strong> Sotherton's vigorous celebrations just before were for a 37.66m effort - a modest throw but at least she didn't impale herself.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>1.02pm: Team GB keirin </strong>Edgar and Hoy start the final. More medals up for grabs here.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>1.04pm: GB GOLD A-HOY! </strong> One lap to go. Hoy led from the front. Edgar sneaked through to third. And then second...</p> <p>And its gold to Hoy! My boss shouts ''Goldrush!'' Edgar takes silver! I feel moderately excited and I'm not afraid to admit it.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> And on that golden bombshell, that's it for this minute-by-minute report. But Lawrence Donegan is in Beijing - <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/16/athletics_live.html\">he's blogging on the athletics right now. </a> You can leave comments there, too.</p> <p>ps. Brazil are now 2-0 up in extra-time in their quarter-final against Cameroon.</p> <p>pps. Usain Bolt has just ambled/strolled/pretty much walked through his 100m semi in 9.85sec. </p> <p>ppps. Cheers for your workload-halving emails. Sorry I had to use them all...</p>"
