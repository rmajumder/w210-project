  "<p>Immigrants went on the rampage yesterday after a Senegalese man was stabbed to death in a southern Spanish resort town popular with British expatriates.</p> <p>Barricades were erected, at least two houses were set on fire and nine cars were damaged in Roquetas de Mar, a small town 15 miles east of Almer\u00eda.</p> <p>The violence flared in an area with a large immigrant population after the 28-year-old man died. Firefighters, trying to put out the blazes, described the scene as a \"pitched battle\" between immigrants and riot police.</p> <p>Police said the violence, which started just before midnight on Saturday, was brought under control at 5am.</p> <p>Four men were arrested, two from Guinea Bissau, one from Nigeria and one from Sudan. </p> <p>Four police officers were injured. A spokesman said: \"For reasons which the police are investigating, [the man] was attacked by a person from the neighbourhood who police are looking for.\"</p> <p>The scenes on the streets of the resort town in Andalucia, which has a population of 71,000, were more reminiscent of riots in the suburbs of Paris.</p> <p>It is the worst rioting involving immigrants in the region since 2000, when three murders in nearby El Ejido were carried out in the space of two weeks. They were apparently committed by Moroccans, and triggered racist violence that led to 23 arrests and 50 injuries and prompted an official protest from Morocco.</p> <p>Despite having one of the fastest rising immigration rates in Europe in the past decade, Spain has largely escaped violence linked to immigration such as that seen in France.</p> <p>Police in Roquetas de Mar said trouble flared when the Senegalese man, whose initials were given as OK, was stabbed when he reportedly tried to intervene in a row over drugs.</p> <p>Miguel Corpas, of the Almer\u00eda regional government, told the Cadena Ser radio station that \"a large group [of immigrants] wanted to take justice into their own hands\".</p> <p>He added that a \"fierce battle took place [in which] the immigrants took to the streets to try to stop the firefighters putting out the fires\".</p> <p>Corpas said the rioters erected barricades, and set fire to containers and to two houses that were completely destroyed. Rioters stoned the firefighters, according to some reports.</p> <p>A quarter of the town's population are said to be African immigrants who come to work in construction or in businesses set up by foreigners.</p>",
  "<p>Cambridge University may have been in a Ken Barlow state of mind when it tried to plant stories with scriptwriters at EastEnders, Coronation Street and Emmerdale to suggest the university was a student-friendly sort of a place. Ken Barlow's first storyline in Coronation Street's first episode was about winning a place at university and finding his accent and roots slightly embarrassing.</p> <p>Poor Ken declares: \"You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than Elsie Tanner and her boyfriends.\" In saying this, he is soul-crushingly unaware that 48 years later he would be the only character still living on the deathless street.</p> <p>There is no direct evidence that Barlow's working class travails were a result of the government encouraging youth into postwar education, but the 1960s were certainly a time when soaps were seen as being as much a tool of government propaganda as, well, government propaganda itself. Whilst soap powder companies had created the genre in the US as product placement opportunities featuring their whiter-than-white products for stay-at-home housewives, we did things differently over here. In fact, the first and most durable and unchanging of British soaps essentially began life as a tool of government. </p> <p><strong>Farming and food production</strong><br>\"The Archers was originally conceived as a means of educating the British public after the second world war in up-to-date methods of farming and food production and as such, there was government input,\" explains Vanessa Whitburn, the programme's editor and executive producer, radio drama. </p> <p>\"The Ministry of Agriculture was directly consulted and sat in on some quarterly story planning meetings through the 1950s. By the 60s this had dropped away, although government departments were still consulted from time to time. This dropped away although many of its stories do give people information about life in the countryside today.\"</p> <p>Since then, soaps have tried to pick up and run with issues of the day with varying degrees of success. \"In 1999, Brookside worked with the national year of reading to create storylines around adult literacy,\" recalls Steven Murphy, the editor of Inside Soap. \"I have to say it didn't really work at all. As soon as you got one character explaining the issue of literacy to another the show stopped being drama and started sounding like the Open University.</p> <p>\"Where it works much better is if a writer comes up with a storyline, and then works with concerned charities for accuracy and off-screen support.\"</p> <p>Murphy highlights EastEnders' forthcoming paedophilia storyline as an example. Bianca's boyfriend Tony is revealed to be a long-term practising paedophile, and the soap's writing team consulted with the NSPCC during scripting and filming as well has having the charity ready to receive calls prompted by the story.</p> <p>\"We never think of an issue and then try and find a character to apply it to - we try and work out what stories are best for each of our characters,\" says Diederick Santer, executive producer, EastEnders. \"A soap can't just communicate an issue directly from a press release or piece of research. A set of statistics, or a newspaper cutting doesn't in itself make a great soap story. Any story has to work as drama, or else the show starts feeling like government, health service, or lobby group propaganda. </p> <p>\"Most importantly, issue stories need to work for, and be completely inhabited by, the show's characters. Mark's HIV wasn't about HIV as such; the story worked because it played at the heart of the Fowlers, the show's most traditional East End family.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, soaps will still perform a Reithian role when required: \"One of our key priorities is to promote fair coverage of lesbian and gay people in the media and we work with programme makers to reflect this,\" says Gary Nunn, communications officer for gay and lesbian lobbying charity Stonewall. </p> <p>\"We're increasingly working with programmes aimed at young people to communicate with them about our education for all campaign, which tackles homophobic bullying in schools. A recent example of this is our work with Hollyoaks where the character Kris Fisher wore a T-shirt with our campaign slogan: 'Some people are gay. Get over it!'.</p> <p>\"The character John Paul McQueen is displaying the poster of the campaign's slogan in his bedroom on the soap. The actor who plays him, James Sutton, is wearing the t-shirt for a feature we did with this month's edition of Attitude magazine.\"</p> <p>Perhaps this is because British soaps, unlike their frothy American cousins, have a tendency to play it gritty. Hence the following recent storylines from Coronation Street: Ashley and Claire's house swap with Sally and Kevin, forced by the credit crunch; Tony unable to sell his new apartments; Todd engaged to Sarah but realising he's gay; Sarah's teenage pregnancy plus an internet stalker whom she met in a chatroom; Tina's abortion; David's truancy and going off the rails; migrant workers in the factory underpaid and not insured; hoodies attacking Norris in the Kabin, Chesney left home alone by negligent mother and ending up in care; Mike suffering from Alzheimer's and Charlie and Shelley's domestic violence.</p> <p>It does seem hard to slip a jovial tale about the crazy student union life at Magdalene College in there - especially as it's pronounced maudlin.</p> <p><strong>Advice and assistance</strong><br>\"We are often approached by charities or organisations with requests to incorporate their campaigns or issues into the show,\" says Alison Sinclair, the Street's publicity manager. </p> <p>\"This is something that we do try to avoid. However we are a soap opera that reflects issues affecting people in Britain in 2008 and to that end we will often explore situations that touch upon current issues. Whenever we do incorporate things like this into the programme our researchers will contact a particular organisation or charity for advice and assistance in getting the details of the story correct.\"</p> <p>With Sarah's teenage pregnancy storyline, for instance, the show worked with the government on the issue - and the relevant ministry was able to provide case studies for magazines or newspapers eager to follow up the issue.</p> <p>All of which suggests that, for the time being at least, the Archers model still holds some sway. And yet, in August, ITV chairman Michael Grade announced that if regulators didn't ease the rules on product placement he would do so unilaterally. </p> <p>\"I'm not sure that the regulator understands the urgency of the need for reform,\" he said, identifying Britain's Got Talent, Lewis and Coronation Street as his focus. </p> <p>All of which could mean that Cambridge need only slip some cash into Corrie's programme budget to ensure it shows another working class kid struggling to make his way at an upmarket university. Given that the story condemned William Roache to 48 years in the same dreary role, however, they may find the problem is in persuading the actor.</p>",
  "<p>The game between Somerset and Durham starting at Taunton tomorrow could help determine the winner of an increasingly tense race for the County Championship after both sides had to make do with rain-affected draws at the weekend. Nottinghamshire lead Division One by four points from Somerset following the sides' weather-beaten stalemate at Trent Bridge, but while Notts have only two games left, both Somerset and fourth-placed Durham - neither of whom has ever won the trophy - have three.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire's own title aspirations received a further blow when it was confirmed yesterday that Surrey, their next opponents on September 17, are hoping to include the Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar in their attack. Turned away by Heathrow customs officials on Wednesday because of an incorrect visa, Shoaib was scheduled to arrive back this morning as Surrey aim to avoid relegation by winning their final two matches, starting tomorrow against Hampshire at the Oval.</p> <p>\"I thought after the debacle the other day Shoaib might just say 'that's it',\" said the Surrey coach, Alan Butcher. \"But he's gone straight back, got the visa and is hopping on a plane again. We hope that proves he has the motivation we need from him to help us over these very important last two matches.\"</p> <p>Shoaib said: \"The eventual aim is to play for Pakistan and I feel Surrey offers me the best opportunity to prove my fitness.\" Since his new county are 18 points adrift of Yorkshire and Lancashire at the bottom of the table he may have to fire immediately - and hope that his team-mates can buck their season's trend and hold their catches.</p> <p>\"It's our fault we're in this position,\" said Butcher. \"If we hadn't dropped 43 catches in the championship we wouldn't be where we are. It's in our hands, we hope. Or out of it, as the case has been so far.\" That was a rare moment of levity in a difficult year for winless Surrey, who were condemned by yesterday's draw with Kent at Canterbury to the worst season in their history - a statistic made slightly less painful by Mark Ramprakash's sixth hundred of the summer and his fourth in successive matches. But Ramprakash's declaration at 307 for nine simply paved the way for Rob Key, who finished with 76 not out from 68 deliveries, and Joe Denly, who hit a 60-ball 80, to thrash 159 in 21 overs as Kent moved third. Only bad light prevented the addition of a batting point.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Andrew Flintoff has echoed the views of his Lancashire captain, Stuart Law, by questioning the club's decision to release Dominic Cork at the end of the season. \"I think Lancashire should have kept him on,\" said Flintoff. \"The best thing that could happen is for someone to turn around and tell him we've made a mistake and keep him at Lancashire, but I'm not sure that is going to happen. I'm all in favour of bringing younger players on, but they have got to be good enough and have got to perform.\"</p> <p>Lancashire's relegation battle was not aided by the fact that bad weather at Chester-le-Street limited their match with Durham to just 95 overs, while Yorkshire's rain-ruined draw with Sussex at Scarborough meant Michael Vaughan did not get the chance to add to his first-innings 19.</p> <p>Worcestershire, who are almost certain of promotion from Division Two, are expected to announce today that they will play their final home matches of the season at Kidderminster after New Road was flooded when the River Severn burst its banks during last week's downpours. The club lost almost \u00a31m when their Worcester headquarters were rendered unplayable by last year's floods.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission's population projections at the end of last month should result in calling time on the UK's open door immigration policy. It predicted that within 50 years Britain would become the most highly populated country in Europe. England is already about to overtake the Netherlands as the most densely populated country in the European Union. On the government's own figures, the population growth due to immigration by 2031 will require building something like seven new Birminghams. This is simply not sustainable.</p> <p>To highlight a much better alternative to this open door policy, Nicholas Soames and I are today announcing a cross-party group, Balanced Migration. Our central idea has the advantage of being both simple and workable. We propose cutting the link between economic migration and the virtually automatic right of workers from abroad to settle here permanently.</p> <p>Every poll emphasises how deeply concerned voters are about the rate of immigration and its impact on British society. Late in the day, both the government and the opposition are feeling their way towards a new policy. Neither party's approach has much prospect of controlling, let alone reducing, the number of newcomers who become permanent residents.</p> <p>The government claims it will control immigration through its new points system. By a subtle use of mirrors it suggests that this is based on the Australian model. What the government doesn't say, however, is that, unlike here, the Australian government starts by deciding the number of new citizens it believes it can be integrated.</p> <p>The Tory proposals are no better. Shadow ministers talk about a cap but fail to specify what they mean. Their approach is more than likely to result in another bureaucratic nightmare. Governments are not good at guessing the labour needs of the economy. </p> <p>What is new is our insistence both on cutting the link between economic migration and settlement and advocating that employers should be the drivers and the guardians of such arrangements. The proposals will, therefore, maintain competitiveness. </p> <p>Employers would have to advertise jobs, first locally and then throughout the EU - as they should now, but some plainly do not. For its part, the government would wish to ensure applicants' qualifications were genuine. These workers would then be admitted, but only for a maximum of four years. They would come to the UK on that clear understanding. Employers would have to produce evidence that workers had left at the end of their contracts. No departure, no approval for new contracts. </p> <p>Employers would, therefore, have a vested interest in policing the system properly. Our proposal would also minimise the cock-ups that any centrally directed approach invariably has in guessing future labour market demands. Not so long ago we saw health planners issuing contracts like sweets for overseas doctors when the first wave of extra \"home produced\" doctors was about to hit the labour market. Our group's objective is summed up in its name. The overall goal in the longer run would be to bring into balance the number of people coming into Britain to settle with the number who leave to live elsewhere in the world. </p> <p>Workers who have done well, and have proved their long-term worth to their company, and who did not wish to return home, would be free to bid for a place in a strictly limited annual quota set by the government in the light of the circumstances at the time. But there would be no automatic right to those places.</p> <p>Our approach does not, of course, solve all Britain's problems on the social cohesion front. But it does offer, for the first time, a real possibility of controlling the number of new citizens, thereby achieving a degree of population stability.</p> <p>The aims of our group fit in with the government's objective of seeking educational reforms that raise significantly the skill levels of young people coming into the labour market. Employers faced with our system would have, for the first time, a vested interest in increasing the skills of their own workforce and better-skilled school leavers. Above all, it would protect the position of low-paid workers who have borne the brunt of the recent influx into Britain. </p> <p>We are putting these ideas forward to start a debate. The onus is now on the political establishment to respond in a way that also meets the overwhelming demand of voters.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:fieldf@parliament.uk\">fieldf@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Steve Chalke, a Baptist minister with a motor mouth and bags of charm, is a very busy man. Six new academies run by his charity, Oasis, have just begun their first terms. Oasis already had three, and another three more are planned for next year. Opening one academy in Bristol late last week, Chalke explained, between bursts of loud cheering in the background, his idea of a faith school. Oasis often uses the same buildings, at least initially, as the local education authority did; it adopts the same admission policies and same staff; sometimes, all that Oasis adds to the school is \"membership of a global movement, Oasis, which is working to transform communities\", based on a vision that is \"person-centered, inclusive, servant-minded - we believe in redemption and transformation and that every person matters\". Everyone has to buy into the values, but not necessarily the belief in Jesus Christ, he adds.</p> <p>This is the kind of rhetoric that incenses critics of faith schools. Why is Andrew Adonis lavishing failing schools on a man with more experience of preaching than of teaching? The expansion of faith schools is a hard-hat area of education policy: you enter at your peril, to face a long-standing league of critics, now newly emboldened with a fashionable fear of Islam, and of religion more generally.</p> <p>So, with hard hat on, here goes the defence: that it is possible to justify faith schools within the state sector with important qualifications; that many of them do a remarkable job; and that it's time the critics put prejudice aside to think more carefully about the source of their appeal to parents.</p> <p>Ethos is the ghost in the machine in education. Everyone recognises it when they see it; parents want it; politicians regard it with awe, but how do you produce it? Most would agree that it's the result of a common set of values articulated by the head and shared by staff, governors, pupils and parents. Get that communal consensus motivated around high aspirations, mutual respect and self-discipline, and you have a successful, well-ordered school. </p> <p>But these are old-fashioned ideas. Walk into any secondary school and one senses how counter-cultural that ethos is. The blazers, badges, Latin mottos, the \"Morning, Sir,\" the emphasis on tradition, formality and obedience: it's an institutional culture decades old. Teachers have the unenviable task of battling against a culture of self-entitlement, individualism and self-promotion to try to generate a common purpose. </p> <p>This is where faith schools can have an advantage. They can fall back on a well-known, religious narrative to which there is still considerable adherence in some form. As the last census showed, over 70% of people in this country still describe themselves as Christian; that may not mean going to church but it may mean wanting children to grow up with broadly Christian values. For a faith school, the common values are familiar to all and easy to explain, and therein lies the possibility of a strong ethos.</p> <p>That is not to say that non-religious schools can't achieve this - of course they can, but it is harder. Secular ethical traditions are honourable but they lack the familiarity, the symbols, the narratives and histories that bring the abstract to emotional life. These issues of character formation have been the subject of two fascinating essays in recent issues of the magazine Prospect. Edward Skidelsky argues that both the secular and sacred \"languages\" underpinning the values of self-discipline and responsibility have been badly eroded. Secular humanism has not found a popular ethical narrative to replace faith; parents, uncertain how to bring up their children with a sense of responsibility for others, resort to school Christianity.</p> <p>Perhaps this is how faith schools have successfully sustained the buy-in of the middle class. It's part of what comprehensive education is about: all children from all backgrounds within a faith community so that the middle classes bring their commitment to education into the mix. This is precisely what so many failing schools have not got, while the middle classes desert the state system to take refuge in highly selective, expensive private schools. So why criticise a part of the system that works?</p> <p>In the vituperative debate on faith schools, a continuing programme of research from the London School of Economics has been used as ammunition by the critics, as it shows that faith schools have a lower proportion of children on free school meals. Critics accuse them of \"cherry-picking\" the more affluent pupils. But Sandra McNally, director of education and skills at the LSE's Centre for Economic Performance, has also analysed the figures nationally and concludes that, although the average proportion of pupils on free meals in secondary schools is 12.9% for Catholic, 10.8% for other religious, and 14% for non-religious, we don't know whether this is evidence of faith schools choosing more affluent pupils or of a bigger proportion of their applicants coming from more affluent homes. The disparity is bigger at primary school level; is this because primary schools are cleverer at weeding out the poor or because many middle-class families start in the state sector even if they end up going private? We'll have to wait for more research to be sure, but I'll hazard a bet that it's the latter.</p> <p>But my support for faith schools is not unqualified, and this is where the Oasis academies are so intriguing. They do not discriminate on grounds of religious faith in staff employment or pupil admission. Chalke does not believe a school should be a holy huddle of the faithful. This radical innovation is what makes other faith schools very uneasy. The Catholic hierarchy successfully fought off quotas of non-believers recently; it is still locked in its ghetto history of tightly-knit migrant communities in hostile host societies. It has used employment discrimination and tight admissions as barricades to defend against \"dilution\" of the ethos.</p> <p>The outcome of this varies enormously across the country; in inner cities, Catholic schools absorb a disproportionate number of black African and Caribbean children - indeed, they are a vital educational resource for these groups. But in areas where the ethnic minority is Asian and Muslim, they can become a repository for white flight. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the record of sectarianism is dismal. Given that the new admissions code places a duty on faith schools to promote community cohesion, the Catholic church needs to interrogate much more closely the role its schools play in different areas.</p> <p>However, far worse forms of segregation blight British education: the residential segregation whereby Kingston upon Thames has 7.9% of pupils eligible for free meals while Tower Hamlets has 58.8%, with concomitant differences in educational achievement, and the even more pernicious cherry-picking routinely done by independent schools - half of which, as charities, are effectively subsidised by the taxpayer. </p> <p>I don't know whether Steve Chalke and Oasis can inject a new vision into their growing network of academies, but such is their drive, commitment and self-belief that I can see why any government - led by either Brown or Cameron - would be won over. Their idealism and sincerity - Oasis youth workers volunteer to live in the community to support the school - win sceptics over because there is a desperate dearth of alternative narratives of transformation in deprived communities with low levels of educational achievement.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Labour MP Frank Field was yesterday accused of pandering to xenophobia by the leftwing thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), after he backed plans for all skilled immigrants from outside the EU to be sent home when their work visas expire after four years.</p> <p>Field, in a report jointly authored with Nicholas Soames, the Tory backbencher, claims that the current wave of immigration is 25 times higher than any previous migration and will increase the population by 2031 to 59 million in England. </p> <p>He identifies the chief source of migration as the large majority of non-EU migrants granted work visas for the country who stay on after the visa expires and are allowed to settle permanently.</p> <p>Field and Soames also back the Tory proposal for an annual quota on the number of non-EU migrants allowed to come to Britain, suggesting on the basis of the latest immigration figures that an annual cap of 20,000 non-EU migrants be set, including dependants. He said the proposals would mean that between 50,000 and 170,000 people a year would no longer acquire \"an almost automatic right to settle here\".</p> <p>The 20,000 would be selected on the basis of their skills as reflected in their salary. The cap would be adjusted annually, taking into account other migration figures including total net British emigration. </p> <p>Field claims in the pamphlet, entitled Balanced Migration, that the government's solution of an Australian-style points system for non-EU migrants based on skills amounts to an open door for tens of thousands to migrate, since any work permit holder staying on for more than five years will be qualified to apply for permanent residence in Britain or probationary citizenship. He claims the rate of inflow is higher than any other previous period of immigration since the Norman Conquest in 1066, making Britain the most crowded land in Europe.</p> <p>Jill Rutter, senior research fellow at the IPPR, rejected the Field analysis. She said: \"The proposal that migrant workers should leave the UK after a four-year period of work would mean that employers could not retain the hard-working migrants they want to keep. For example, football clubs would have to lose talent such as Kanu, Viduka and Drogba. We need to make migration work for Britain, rather than play to xenophobic sentiments.\"</p> <p>Immigration minister Liam Byrne said yesterday: \"Our tough new points system plus our plans for newcomers to earn their citizenship will reduce overall numbers of economic migrants coming to Britain, and the numbers awarded permanent settlement. </p> <p>\"Crucially the points system means only the migrants with the skills Britain needs can come - and no more. Unlike made-up quotas, this stops government cutting business off from the skills it needs when they need them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Around one million key workers - from teachers to immigration officers - are to be asked to take part in a series of strikes from November, reviving the spectre of the \"winter of discontent\" that brought down the last Labour government 30 years ago.</p> <p>Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the 300,000-member Public and Commercial Services Union, announced the move yesterday on the eve of the TUC conference.</p> <p>Three unions - the PCS, the National Union of Teachers and the University and College Union - are due to ballot more than 650,000 people on strike action over Gordon Brown's 2% pay-rise limit for public sector workers. The first two unions have already decided to ballot; the UCU will decide at a conference shortly.</p> <p>Another 300,000 workers in local government belonging to Unison are already committed to strikes this winter. Other unions could also decide to ballot members when the pay restraint policy is debated today at the congress in Brighton.</p> <p>Serwotka said the action would be much more intensive than the successful one-day strike back in April - when teachers, civil servants and college lecturers all walked out - and would involve the whole of Whitehall from tax officers to coastguards and jobcentre staff. He accused ministers - who earn between \u00a392,000 and \u00a3138,000 a year - of \"not having the faintest idea\" how low-paid workers coped with food and fuel bills while their pay in departments such as the Home office and the Department for Work and Pensions went up by between nought and 1%.</p> <p>The PCS union has produced a YouTube video quoting staff who did not have the money to cope with fuel bills and were in tears after finding they could not afford birthday presents for their children.</p> <p>Serwotka said: \"The government says it is on the side of hard-pressed families, yet compounds the financial misery for hundreds of thousands of hard-working people by pursuing an unjust pay policy.</p> <p>\"The government is out of touch with the people who keep the country running ... peddling the myth that they are the causes of inflation when they see their food, fuel and housing costs soar.\"</p> <p>The growing unrest among unions about pay restraint came as Brendan Barber, the TUC general secretary, made it clear that he regarded the government's pay policy as \"absolutely wrong-headed\".</p> <p>He is certain to tell Gordon Brown and chancellor Alistair Darling of the strength of union feeling when they come to Brighton tomorrow.</p> <p>At a press briefing earlier, Barber outlined the TUC's response to the economic turmoil by calling for a package of measures involving tax cuts for the poorest and the abolition of tax privileges for the rich. He insisted the package should be treated not as a \"shopping list\" but as an \"economic strategy\" to combat the crisis.</p> <p>He appealed for the end of \"economic masochism\", which he defined as trying to choke off external inflation by depressing the domestic economy.</p> <p>Instead he called for US-style tax cuts for the poor - with further cuts in the basic rate of income tax, cuts in VAT on property renovation and energy and a near doubling of the winter fuel allowance from \u00a3250 to \u00a3400 per household.</p> <p>He said the government should raise more money not by raising the 40% tax rate for those earning over \u00a3100,000, but by cutting tax privileges and setting a minimum 32% tax rate which must be paid by the wealthy, regardless of allowances they could claim.</p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Ike was closing in on Cuba last night after damaging 80% of homes on the Caribbean islands of Turks and Caicos, causing fresh misery for a region battered by tropical storms. </p> <p>Ike, a category 4 storm with winds of up to 135mph, blew off hundreds of roofs and wrecked scores of fishing boats in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory.</p> <p>Thousands of tourists fled the archipelago before the near-direct hit, and residents who stayed hunkered down \"just holding on for life\", said Michael Misick, the chief minister. \"They got hit really, really bad. A lot of people have lost their houses, and we will have to see what we can do to accommodate them.\"</p> <p>There were no immediate reports of casualties but the territory would need urgent aid, said Clive Evans, of the British Red Cross. \"These islands have not seen storms like this for 48 years.\"</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence confirmed that the frigate HMS Iron Duke and support vessel Wave Ruler were on their way to the area to offer disaster relief.

The US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) predicted the storm's eye might hit Havana, a city with many vulnerable old buildings, by Monday night. </p> <p>Residents in the Cuban capital stocked up on candles and tinned food, workers rushed to protect coffee plants and other crops, and plans were under way to distribute food and cooking oil to disaster areas. </p> <p>The Foreign Office last night advised against all but essential travel to Cuba. </p> <p>Authorities at the US naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, on the island's eastern tip, closed beaches and banned cars from roads.

Several computer projections have Ike restrengthening into a major hurricane and menacing the Louisiana and Mississippi coastlines along the Gulf of Mexico by the end of the week.Many residents there are still returning after fleeing Gustav, a storm that in the US failed to deliver the punch it once threatened.</p> <p>\"Our citizens are weary and tired and have spent a lot of money evacuating from Gustav,\" said Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans. \"My expectation this time is it will be very difficult to move the kind of numbers out of this city that we moved during Gustav.\"</p> <p>Although the threat to Florida Keys appeared to recede, a phased evacuation for residents was carried out yesterday.</p> <p>Other projections turned Ike west in the Gulf of Mexico towards the Texas-Mexico border, highlighting the lack of confidence in longer-term forecasts.</p> <p>\"It is much too early to anticipate which areas along the Gulf coast could be impacted,\" said Jamie Rhome, a senior forecaster at the NHC.</p> <p>Ike brought further devastation in Haiti, killing 48 people and destroying the last bridge into the port of Gonaives, where people are very short of food. The latest casualties brought Haiti's death toll from four tropical storms in less than a month to 306. Although rain stopped by late afternoon, large areas remained vulnerable to flooding because rivers were swollen from last week's tropical storm Hanna.</p> <p>A trickle of aid in the form of drinking water and high-energy biscuits has not eased the desperation. \"What I saw in this city today is close to hell on earth,\" a UN envoy, Hedi Annabi, said after touring Gonaives on Saturday.</p>",

I was in India until I was 16, then Zimbabwe for two years, and then Kuwait. I studied in China and New York, before settling in London. Even at 10, I had a sense that I didn't want to get married and have children. I know a lot of kids say things like that, but I didn't change my mind about it later on. I wasn't interested in relationships or finding a girlfriend, and was very sure I didn't have an interest in boys either. </p> <p>Gradually my school friends spent more and more time talking about girls and pursuing relationships, but I could never grasp what they were expecting to get out of it. There were family parties in India where all the kids would gather outside in the garden. </p> <p>I was 13 and had a best friend, Kasim, who was a year younger than me. He had a crush on an Australian girl called Jessica - everyone seemed to think she was the prettiest. We had lots of whispered discussions about what he could say to her, and even though I thought it was a ridiculous game, I wanted to fit in, so I pretended I had a crush too - on a French girl called Sylvie. She was a safe bet because she was so unlikely to reciprocate. I knew she wasn't at all interested in me. I'd just discuss her with the boys. </p> <p>There were times as I got older when girls did seem interested in me, but I always deliberately ignored their signals. I wanted to avoid getting into a situation I'd feel uncomfortable with, so I never even kissed a girl. The first girl I kissed became my wife. </p> <p>When I was 13, my father gave me a book on sex education. I felt as if I was reading about a foreign culture; I just couldn't see why anyone would go to so much trouble just to have sex. I tried looking at pornography on the internet. I wasn't disgusted or appalled - it was just boring, like looking at wallpaper.</p> <p>Masturbation was another topic of conversation in those days, and I did masturbate. It wasn't a sexual urge for me, I didn't fantasise, it was just something my body decided to do. People say about asexuals: \"But if they masturbate doesn't that make them sexual?\" It's hard to explain, but if you're asexual you don't necessarily feel an explicit connection between masturbation and sexual orientation. It's just part of having a human body - a physical, biological process. </p> <p>After we moved to Zimbabwe I went back to visit my old friend Kasim. The last time we'd seen each other we'd been into computer games, drinking Coke and going for pizza. Two years on, it was a shock to see how much Kasim had changed. Sex was his major preoccupation. He had a girlfriend and was on the brink of going all the way with her. One afternoon we were with some of Kasim's friends, and he began goading two of the girls into kissing each other in front of a camera. The whole atmosphere was really charged, and I felt out of my depth. I'd fallen behind. Kasim had been my friend a long time, but he'd entered this different world without me. </p> <p>By the time I went to university, I was happy to let people wonder about my sexuality. I wasn't pretending to talk about girls any more. Some people assumed I was gay, but my best friend Simon was the first person to confront me directly. We were studying in Hangzhou, in China, just south of Shanghai. It's a very beautiful city, on a lake with mountains, and we were walking through the streets when Simon asked me outright. First he made a joke about whether \"I liked girls ... or boys?\" I laughed but he persisted and said \"So what are you?\" I just said, \"I'm not straight and I'm not gay, and that's it, full stop.\" Back then I didn't know what term to use.</p> <p>The following summer I was surfing the internet when I read a post from a girl who wasn't attracted to anyone. Someone had suggested she should be aware of \"asexuality\", and gave the address of a website: <a href=\"http://www.asexuality.org\">asexuality.org</a>. When I went to the site and read the material, I was quite dismissive at first, because you just don't hear about other asexuals. Since Freud and Kinsey, and even to an extent the sexual revolution of the 60s, we tend to believe anyone without a sexual orientation must be repressed or delusional. Asexuality is therefore an impossibility. Kinsey labelled us \"X\", a statistical throwaway category for anyone damaged to the point where they can't express any sexuality. </p> <p>Gradually, though, through visiting the site, I came to realise that these were just ordinary people; people who were writing things I'd thought myself, but had never heard anyone else express. It was such a relief. Finally I had a label - a way to explain myself that could settle all the awkwardness and questioning. </p> <p>I told my close friends straightaway. Only one female friend didn't really believe me. I think she thought I was secretly in love with her. </p> <p>Back at college I decided to get it over with in one day by wearing a T-shirt saying: \"Asexuality is not just for amoebas\". I was nervous, but I'd already told a dozen or so people, and was used to answering the same questions over and over. No one has ever reacted really badly to me - I've been lucky. </p> <p>I told my mother shortly after finding the asexual website, and she said: \"Well as long as you understand the possibility that one of these days you'll meet someone and want to settle down with them.\" I wasn't so sure. I'd already resigned myself to a solitary existence. I'd convinced myself I could form strong friendships and was independent enough to fare OK. Luckily my mother always ends up being right about everything.</p> <p>When my studies took me to New York, I got more involved with the asexual community there. I posted messages on their website and there were regular meet-ups in a little pink tea shop in the East Village - I guess you could call it the asexual equivalent of a gay bar.</p> <p>One day I got an email from Amanda. She was asexual, living close by, and offered to show me around the neighbourhood. In case she was cruising for an asexual boyfriend, I responded with a warning that I was \"vehemently anti-romantic\". But we met up anyway, for tea and ice-skating, and we took to meeting a lot. </p> <p>I loved Amanda's attitude to life and enjoyed hanging out with her. And she was pretty. At first I tried to treat it like any other friendship. Then I found myself travelling four miles downtown to deliver sandwiches when she told me she was hungry. Two months in, we were at a gig and it seemed like a good idea to hold her hand. I felt cautious about it but just wanted to. I wondered if I could. Then I found I couldn't let go. </p> <p>That evening ended with us agreeing that our friendship was an important thing. We wanted to commit for life. In the asexual community we don't form relationships lightly. If you don't want to spend the rest of your life with a person, there's no reason to make such a special commitment. </p> <p>When we announced our engagement, our families were happy for us, and our friends in the asexual community were particularly pleased. On our wedding night, my mother-in-law insisted on booking us into a honeymoon suite, so we invited all our friends to an after party. We played Scrabble late into the night and everyone stayed over and slept on the hotel-room floor. </p> <p>People always ask how our marriage is different from just being friends, but I think a lot of relationships are about that - being friends. We have built on our friendship, rather than scrapping it and moving on somewhere else. The obvious way we differ is that we don't have sex, though we do kiss and cuddle. We like to joke that the longer we're married the less unusual this is. By the time we've been married five years we'll be just like everyone else. </p> <p>Do I feel as if I'm missing out on something? Not really. We've decided that if either of us wants to try sex out in the future then we will see what we can do. We would both be willing to compromise because we're in a relationship and that's what you do. </p> <p>When it comes to the future and to children, we're big advocates of adoption. We're not so fussed about passing on our own genes. Right now we're quite happy with what we've got. After moving around so much, I can say now that wherever Amanda is - that's home.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Paul Cox was interviewed by Bridget O'Donnell.

  "<p>Over the last year, as the US economy has slipped toward (and likely into) recession, there has been much talk of decoupling. According to this idea the global economy has decoupled from the US economy and can continue growing even if the US goes into recession. </p> <p>That idea is now proving fragile. Instead of decoupling, the global economy is showing signs of a concertina effect. Thus, as the US economy grinds to a halt, much of the rest of the world seems to be also slowing and bumping in behind.</p> <p>Ever since the East Asian financial crisis of 1997 the US has served as the locomotive of the global economy. This locomotive role has had US consumers engage in a 10-year consumption binge financed by debt and rising house prices. That binge pushed the household saving rate to record lows, and it also resulted in record US trade deficits.</p> <p>Trade data show the US has run large trade deficits with every major industrial region of the global economy \u2013 Europe, Japan, China, East Asia, Canada and Mexico. That pumped spending into these regions, fuelling their growth. </p> <p>This economic arrangement has created a dependence on the US market, and the dependence has been further deepened by policies of export-led growth. Unable or unwilling to grow their own domestic markets, countries have relied on policies that explicitly promote exports.</p> <p>In many developing countries these policies have had the added benefit of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Thus, exports have kept factories busy, while the prospect of future exports has tempted companies to relocate production facilities to developing economies. Meanwhile, the US economy has benefited from cheap imports, but its manufacturing sector has been eroded and consumers have loaded up on debt in an unsustainable fashion.</p> <p>The bursting of the US house price bubble has shifted this process into reverse, slowing US import growth and replacing financial exuberance with financial fear. But rather than global decoupling, there are signs of a shared global slowdown. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement\">Nafta</a> economies of Canada and Mexico are clearly vulnerable because of their large trade dependence on the US and their tight integration into the US supply chain. In Europe, Ireland, Spain and Italy are either in recession or on the cusp of recession. Growth has slowed sharply too in the UK and France, and Japan has also lowered its growth outlook.</p> <p>Germany, which is Europe's largest economy, was supposed to replace the US locomotive. However, it is one of the world's most export-dependent economies. German growth has kept going longer than other European economies because of low consumer debt and export growth to Opec economies, but Germany is now also slowing. Moreover, its policies of wage restraint and hyper-export competitiveness pose a menace rather than a help to the overall European economy.</p> <p>The hope that China could pull East Asia through a US slowdown was always a fiction. A quick inspection of China's trade shows that its trade deficits with other East Asian economies are derived from its trade surpluses with the US. China assembles imported parts from the rest of East Asia and sells the assembled product in US markets. That means when the US slows, the slowdown ripples back via China into the broader East Asian economy.</p> <p>The commodity-exporting economies of Australia, Latin America, and Africa have all done well from the commodity price boom. However, if the industrial economies of North America, Europe and East Asia slow, that can be expected to negatively impact commodity prices and exports.</p> <p>Closer co-movements of national economies are a logical consequence of corporate and financial globalisation since it makes economies more inter-dependent. Those co-movements can become a concertina when they are driven by a common factor such as export-led growth that relies on debt-financed US consumers serving as buyer of last resort.</p> <p>The key to avoiding a concerted global downturn is for developed economies to sustain confidence in financial markets, resist misdiagnosed calls for a war on inflation, and initiate policies that strengthen demand. Meanwhile, developing countries must continue spending even as their exports to the US slow. These countries now have the foreign exchange reserves to ride out a weakened trade outlook. The open question is whether they have the sources of internal demand.</p> <p>Developing that internal demand is a core problem. However, it remains off the development policy agenda because the current paradigm is obsessed with the supply-side and neglects development of the demand-side. As long as that is so, the global economy will remain beset by an unstable and inadequate configuration of demand.</p>"
