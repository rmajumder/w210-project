  "<p>David Frum has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/23/AR2008102302081_2.html\">an interesting piece</a> in the Wash Post this morning in which he says let's face it, it's over, and the GOP should basically give on McCain and salvage what it can:</p> <blockquote> <p>What should Republicans be doing differently? Two things: </p> <p>1. Every available dollar that can be shifted to a senatorial campaign must be shifted to a senatorial campaign. Right now, we are investing heavily in Pennsylvania in hopes of corralling those fabled \"Hillary Democrats\" for McCain. But McCain's hopes in Pennsylvania are delusive: The state went for Kerry in 2004, Gore in 2000 and Clinton in 1992 and 1996, and McCain lags Obama by a dozen points in recent polls. But even if we were somehow to take the state, that victory would not compensate for the likely loss of Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and other states tipped to the Democrats by demographic changes and the mortgage crisis. The \"win Pennsylvania and win the nation\" strategy may have looked plausible in August and September, when McCain trailed Obama by just a few digits. Now it looks far-fetched. </p> <p>But it is not far-fetched to hope that we can hold 45 or 46 of our current 49 Senate seats. In 1993, then-Senate Minority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) stopped Hillary-care with only 43 seats. But if we are reduced to just 40 or 41 senators, as could easily happen, Republicans and conservatives would find themselves powerless to stop anything -- and more conservative Democrats would lose bargaining power with the Obama White House. </p> <p>2. We need a message change that frankly acknowledges that the Democrats are probably going to win the White House -- and that warns of the dangers of one-party, left-wing government. There's a lot of poll evidence that voters prefer divided government. By some estimates, perhaps as many as 8 percent of voters consciously cast strategic votes in favor of division. These are the voters we need to be talking to now. </p> <p>I'm not suggesting that the RNC throw up its hands. But down-ballot Republicans need to give up on the happy talk about how McCain has Obama just where he wants him, take off their game faces and say something like this: </p> <p>\"We're almost certainly looking at a Democratic White House. I can work with a Democratic president to help this state. But we need balance in Washington. </p> <p>\"The government now owns a big stake in the nation's banking system. Trillions of dollars are now under direct government control. It's not wise to put that money under one-party control. It's just too tempting. You need a second set of eyes on that cash. You need oversight and accountability. Otherwise, you're going to wake up two years from now and find out that a Democratic president, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House have been funneling a ton of that money to their friends and allies. It'll be a big scandal -- but it will be too late. The money will be gone. Divided government is the best precaution you can have.\" </p> <p>It's the only argument we have left. And, as the old Washington saying goes, it has the additional merit of being true. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>I think this makes sense. But what's interesting is that one could of course make the divided government argument an argument for McCain. That is, \"You know the Democrats are going to control Congress, so let's elect a Republican president to have balance.\" In fact some conservatives still thumping the tub for McCain are making just this argument. </p> <p>So it's interesting that Frum takes it in exactly the opposite direction. It's almost like he (and a few others) want McCain to lose so they can have the intra-party argument and showdown that they've been itching to have for a little while now anyway (Frum wrote a book last year, which I reviewed more positively than not in the New York Review, arguing that the GOP needs to give itself a major facelift).</p> <p>I think he's probably on to something that could help a few GOP Senate candidates keep or win their seats.<br></p>",
  "<p>Gerhard Schr\u00f6der declared 10 years ago, during the Third Way and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">New Labour</a> honeymoon, that \"economic policy is neither left not right. It is either good or bad\". Ten years later, we are allowed to conclude that this was a self-fulfilling prophecy. When he made his declaration, 11 out of 15 governments of the then European Union were run by socialists. Now, election after election, country after country, the left is elbowed out from positions of power. In the course of the last decade, social-democratic parties have presided over the economic policy of privatisation of gains and nationalisation of losses. They ran states preoccupied with deregulation, privatisation and individualisation. </p> <p>At the end of the New Labour decade, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> leads the all-European effort to mobilise the taxpayers into the campaign to recapitalise the capitalist economy, saving it from the consequences of its own greed and inbuilt suicidal tendency. There is almost nothing left to distinguish left from right in economic, or any other, policy. <br> And there is no distinctly left vision or credible program that would appeal to the imagination of electors and convince them that good economic policy may be synonymous with left economic policy. Following the line of Third Way thinking, to be left meant to be able to do more thoroughly the job that the right demands to be done but fails to do properly. It was Tony Blair's New Labour that laid institutional foundations under Margaret Thatcher inchoate ideas of \"there is no society, only individuals and families\". It was the French Socialist Party that did most for the dismantling of the French social state. And as to the post-communist parties in east-central Europe, renamed as social democrats, they are the most enthusiastic and vociferous advocates and most consistent practitioners of unlimited freedom for the rich and leaving the poor to their own care.</p> <p>Over more than a century, the distinctive mark of the left was to believe that it is the sacrosanct duty of community to care for and to assist all its members, collectively, against the powerful forces they are unable to fight alone. Social-democratic hopes to perform that task used to be invested in the modern state, powerful and ambitious enough to limit the damage perpetuated by the free play of the markets by forcing the economic interests to respect the political will of the nation and the ethical principles of national community. But nation states are no longer as powerful as they used to be or hoped to become. The political states once claiming full military, economic and cultural sovereignty over their territory and its population are no longer sovereign in any of those aspects of common life. </p> <p>Genuine powers, the powers that decide the range of life options and life chances of most of our contemporaries, have evaporated from the nation state into the global space, where they float free from political control: politics has remained as local as before and therefore is no longer able to reach them, let alone to constrain. One of the effects of globalisation is the divorce between power (the capacity to have things done) and politics. We have now power freed from politics in the global space, and politics deprived of power in the local space.</p> <p>That development left the socialists without the crucial (the only?) instrument intended to be used in the implementation of their project. Simply, a social state guaranteeing existential security to all can no longer be constructed, nor survive, in the framework of the nation state (the forces that would have to be tamed for that purpose are not in the nation state command). Attempts to use the weakened state for that purpose were in most cases foiled under the pressure of exterritorial, global economic forces or the markets. </p> <p>Increasingly, social democrats revealed their sudden inability to deliver on their promise. Hence the desperate effort to find another trademark and legitimation. The Italian Democratic Party or for that matter the Polish Left and Democrats, exemplify the destination to which that search leads: total absence of trademark and legitimation. In this form, the distant offspring of the old left can count only on the failures of their adversaries as their sole electoral chance, and on the disaffected and angry victims of those failures as their only electoral constituency. </p> <p>The first collateral casualty was the issue of existential security. That past jewel in the left's crown has been dropped by the parties wrongly called left; it now lies, so to speak, on the street \u2013 from which it has been promptly picked up by forces equally wrongly called right. The Italian Lega is now promising to restore the existential security \u2013 which the Democratic Party promises to further undermine by more deregulation of capital and trade markets and more flexibility of the labour market, and by a yet wider opening of the country doors to the mysterious, unpredictable and uncontrollable global forces. </p> <p>Only, fraudulently, it interprets the causes of existential insecurity differently from the left of the past: not as a product of the capitalist free-for-all (freedom for the high and mighty, impotence for the lowly and resourceless), but as the outcome of the well-off Lombardians needing to share their wealth with indolent Calabrians or Sicilians and of the need, common to them all, to share their means of living with foreigners. They forget that the immigration of millions of ancestors of the 21st century Italians to the US and Latin America enormously contributed to their present riches. </p> <p><em>After New Labour, the second debate in the Who owns the progressive future series, organised by Comment is free and Soundings magazine, will be held in London at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">Kings Place</a> on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Two teams of football players (and an official):</strong> </p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><br><strong>West Ham:</strong> Green, Faubert, Collins, Upson, Ilunga, Mullins, Parker, Bowyer, Di Michele, Bellamy, Cole. Subs: Lastuvka, Lopez, Etherington, Boa Morte, Davenport, Collison, Sears. </p> <p><strong>Arsenal: </strong>Almunia, Eboue, Gallas, Silvestre, Clichy, Walcott, Fabregas, Song Billong, Nasri, Bendtner, Van Persie. Subs: Fabianski, Diaby, Sagna, Toure, Ramsey, Djourou, Adebayor.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: Phil Dowd (Staffordshire)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Afternoon all. </strong>While the easily-amused are all focusing on the continuing circus up at White Hart Lane, Tottenham - and Harry Redknapp's - new neighbours Arsenal have gone eastward to his former stomping ground West Ham. </p> <p>Redknapp used to run this place as though it was a youth club, signing players like Marco Boogers, Florin Raducioiu and Samassi Abou, loosely assembling them into a slightly-orchestrated rabble and sending them out to see what happened. Defeat, usually, sometimes by massive margins.</p> <p>Things have changed for the better all around, of course, and the monotone of Alan Curbishley was replaced earlier this season by the jinking Italian Gianfranco Zola, to give West Ham a touch of the exotic. It hasn't necessarily worked: they've lost to West Brom, Bolton and Hull, despite beating Wigan, Blackburn, Newcastle and Fulham. But the good times are sort of back in East London.</p> <p>Hull, of course, also beat Arsenal at the Emirates a couple of weeks back, all the more surprising since Arsene Wenger's side has been looking characteristically fluent this season. Although few can expect them to cling onto the coat-tails of the likes of Hull, they can go four points clear of Manchester United in fourth place if they win here.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>West Ham haven't kept a clean sheet all season.</strong> And Lucas Neill has dropped out of today's line-up. You do the math. James Collins returns for West Ham and Di Michele is in the midfield.</p> <p><strong>For Arsenal</strong>, Adebayor is rested from the starting line-up with Nicklas Bendtner coming in. Alexandre Song replaces Denilson in midfield, even though the Brazilian had played every Premier League match of the season so far.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>Mac Millings is already in the inbox, but seems to be concerned with everything except what's going on here: \"I was just over at the Live Scoreboard,\" says Mac. \"It's still strange seeing Manchester City ahead with Robinho as the scorer. Not as weird as seeing Spurs 1-0 (Pavlyuchenko), though.\" Other football matches are available.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min: </strong>Arsenal get things under-way, with their new-look front line of Bendtner and van Persie. But it's another relatively unfamiliar face who gets on the end of their first flowing move: Song finding some space in the Hammers' box and firing a shot at Green.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2 mins:</strong> This is end to end stuff! On the match's second move, West Ham force Gallas to shepherd the ball back to Manuel Almunia.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 mins:</strong> Carlton Cole spins away from his marker in the middle of Arsenal's half and powers towards the edge of the box. The Arsenal back-line stand firm, Cole is forced to square to Bellamy and that's the end of that one. At the other end, Fabregas floats a long ball onto the penalty spot where Upson tangles with Van Persie. The ball goes behind, but Upson may have impeded the Dutch striker.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 mins:</strong> Nasri is playing wide on the left against a narrow West Ham and gets in a cross that Collins stretches for and scrambles clear. Fabregas and Nasri jink and dink in the middle of the pitch, but West Ham remain unimpressed and get it clear - for a moment or two.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 mins:</strong> West Ham have started here like they're the away side, leaving Cole up front alone and finding him when they break down the Arsenal attacks. Cole is big and strong but has been outwitted a couple of times by Gallas and any danger evaporates.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 mins: </strong>Cole goes crumpling to the turf on the left edge of the Arsenal box, cries out, winces, then gets up again when no free kick is given. But <em>that</em>'s better: Van Persie is caught in possession in his own half and the ball falls for Di Michele, who lets fly from 25 yards. It's rising but Almunia is still forced to push it over his bar. Oh, and Man City have just gone 2-0 up, with Robinho scoring again.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 mins:</strong> The game is settling more now, with Arsenal, surprisingly, happy to take the sting out of things. Fabregas takes his time in the middle of the pitch, finding a darting lateral run from Bendtner. The Dane finds space and shoots from outside the box, dragged wide.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 mins:</strong> Craig Bellamy, who surely could have a brilliant career in MLS if the success of his twin Darren Huckerby is anything to go by, probably interests the scouts by blazing over from 30 yards.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>17 mins:</strong> Here's how this one's going so far: Arsenal are stroking it around the middle of the pitch confidently enough, with the final ball cut out. West Ham are stroking it around the middle of the pitch a little less confidently, but confidently enough, but are rushing their passes or shots in the final third and nothing is coming of that either.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>18 mins:</strong> I don't know anything about this Di Michele character, except for the fact that he's the standout player in this match so far. Most recently, he pops up on the left, cuts a cross back to Cole, whose feet for a big man aren't as good as the feet of most big men who have feet that are surprisingly good for a biug man, and he stumbles over it.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>20 mins:</strong> Di Michele is once again the furthest forward, but again can feed Cole. At the other end, Arsenal finally find their zip as Walcott takes it outside the narrow left back, finds himself whizzing into the box and unleashes a rising drive that Green tips over. Bendtner was in acres of space in the middle and should perhaps have been picked out by the England winger.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>22 mins:</strong> It's a rainy afternoon and a largely indifferent start to a largely indifferent match and minute-by-minute. Praise be to Gary Naylor and his encyclopaedic memory of things that really aren't worth remembering, except in these precise moments: \"Readers of a certain age may remember The Numskulls who appeared in various British comics,\" begins Naylor. \"The set-up was that they lived inside a boy's head all working away to control his movement and senses. Everyone knew their role and discharged it efficiently. They were also fit for their particular purpose, some small and quick, others larger. Due to their efforts, the machine (boy) worked. Those Numskulls remind me of Arsenal - and like Arsenal, the strip wasn't quite as interesting or successful as it might have been.\" Pick the bones out of that.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24 mins:</strong> A moment of madness from Robert Green goes unpunished by a dawling linesman. A long ball is plucked out the air by the keeper, standing two yards outside the box. He's clearly out of his territory but the linesman is miles behind the play and somehow he gets away with it.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>26 mins:</strong> Three things happen in quick succession: my screen goes blank, Arsenal have a good chance from a corner, Cesc Fabregas is booked. The first of those things renders it difficult to fill in much about the second two.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>28 mins:</strong> Great save from Almunia keeps the scores even. Scott Parker finds room in the middle, spins and sets Bellamy scampering through the middle, showing a clean pair of heels to the Arsenal defence. He angles his shot across Almunia, but he sticks out a leg and rebounds it over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>31 mins: </strong>After now seeing a replay, Parker's ball to set Bellamy through was even better than it first appeared. He received a pass inside his own half as he was just toppling off-balance. But before he hit the deck, he managed pne glance and one touch into the path of the galloping Bellamy. Bendtner goes close here; Robinho gets his hat-trick and Gary Naylor finds another one from his rainy day collection: \"Can the multinational readership of the MBM tell us determinedly monolingual Brits what footballers' names mean in their native tongues? Holzenbein, late of West Germany, famously translated as \"wooden leg\" and as for Bastien Schweinsteiger, well let's not. I'm guessing here, but does Gallas mean \"Gauloises smoker\" and Bentdner mean \"as out of place as Serginho in the 1982 Brazil team\"?\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>34 mins: </strong>Upton Park is rocking as West Ham scent that they might be able to beat a strangely lethargic Arsenal here. They flood forward but Bellamy's final ball lets him down - in that he gives it straight to a couple of ambling defenders.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>36 mins:</strong> Eboue shimmies down the right but crosses into the arms of Green. On the other side of the West Ham box, Bendtner turns this way and that before getting a far more effective shot. Green dives to his left and pushes it, one handed, round the post.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>38 mins:</strong> Scott Parker snaffles out the most recent danger from the lively Bendtner, who spends just too long on the ball on the edge of the box and allows the energetic midfielder to clatter it away.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>40 mins:</strong> Van Persie wastes a free kick in a decent position, when he attempts to float it onto the spot but doesn't clear the first man. It's especially dangerous because the big men are up from the back and West Ham break at pace. It's two-versus-two for a moment, but the profligate Bellamy again passes poorly to the feet of an opponent.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>41 mins: </strong>Now Bellamy hammers one way over the bar after being teed up by Parker and then Cole.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>43 mins:</strong> Parker finally takes it too far and goes into the book for clattering through the back of an Arsenal midfielder, who was flattened so quickly I didn't even get to see his face. That's a yellow card for Parker, and a poor free kick from Fabregas who also hits it too flat into the box and allows West Ham to clear.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>44 mins:</strong> Ilunga finds himself further forward than at any previous time and swings in a dangerous cross from the left, low and right between Almunia and the encroaching Carlton Cole. They both go for it, as entitled, and although the keeper comes away with it, he also gets a smack in the ribs from the striker's boots.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>45+1 mins: </strong>\"Can everyone ignore Gary Naylor's request, please?\" says Tony, redundantly. \"I was happy to think his [Schweinsteiger's] name meant 'Pigsticker' until some clever clogs explained it was something too boring to remember.\" To be honest Tony, everyone is ignoring everything this afternoon: my inbox is hardly what you'd call creaking. Half-time.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Strangely overlooked during the actualy match narrative, the peculiar moment featuring Robert Green (24 mins) dominates the half-time discussions. The West Ham keeper was definitely a yard out of his box when he caught a long through-ball and might well be having an early bath right now. Instead, he's pulled off a couple of good saves and will join 10 colleagues for the second half fancying they might get something out of this.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half-time tattle:</strong> \"Tony may be incurious,\" laments Gary Naylor. \"But I've been doing some research on footballers' names. \"Fabregas\" is Catalan for \"being on the way to Barcelona\", \"Robinho\" is Portuguese for \"a Brazilian who will change places with an Argentine, yet stay in the same city\", \"Eboue\" is French for \"not good enough to win anything\".\" Meanwhile, Mac Millings is speaking in puns: \"I don't know much about the meaning of footballers' names (31 min) but I do know that Matthew Upson's dad's first name is Get, named after what Roy Keane probably didn't say to Alf-Inge Haaland.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> West Ham fans are singing \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\". I'm holding back my thoughts on that. They're off again at Upton Park with no half-time changes.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>47 mins:</strong> I <em>think</em> Faubert just had a shot from about 75 yards. Seriously. Surprisingly, it didn't beat Almunia, who was off his line.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>48 mins:</strong> Nasri has been quiet - as has most of the Arsenal midfield in truth - and here he manages to squeeze between Faubert and Bellamy but pass it straight where all of his colleagues aren't, and West Ham clear. Soon after a neat, tight exchange of give and goes, involving Nasri, earn a corner for Arsenal, that Walcott heads over.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>50 mins:</strong> A comedic misunderstanding from Gallas and Almuniua ends with the captain kicking the ball behind the goal for a corner, under no pressure. The corner bounces off Upson but is safe.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>52 mins:</strong> Clichy picks up a booking for going sliding in the middle of the pitch where otherwise there was no danger. The resulting free kick again finds a West Ham head - Cole's I think - but his header is soft and comfortably dealt with.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>53 mins:</strong> Everyone's at this bicycle kick game these days, but Bendtner probably shouldn't and he skies one closer to the Arctic than the West Ham goal. A fizzed cross moments later is dangerously chipped over his own bar by Upson; a decent clearance rather than shocking howler.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>55 mins:</strong> Penalty shout for West Ham as Cole crosses from the left and it maybe hits an arm, maybe not, but I can't make a judgment because I'm reading this, from Katja Leistenschneider: \"Schweinsteiger actually translates into \"pig mounter\". That's still boring, though - at least for those of us whose fantasy level is about as high as the quality of the match.\" But what does Leistenschneider mean?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>57 mins: </strong>Collins and Van Persie challenge for the ball in the West Ham six-yard box and the Dutchman is muscled out of it, going down clutching his knee. He's not permanently damaged and the danger is cleared. Then, up the other end, there are two speculative penalty shouts - both for handball, neither given - before Arsenal break again and Van Persie attempts to wriggle past four players to get a shot in. He can't, but the match is suddenly alive. Alex Song is booked.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>60 mins:</strong> Now the clocks have gone back and everything, this suddenly feels like one of those old-school top-flight matches, played on a boggy, freezing pitch in the middle of winter. It's gloomy out there, even if it's not too cold or boggy, but it's also now a full-blooded end-to-end encounter, with some desperate lunges going in to stop promising breaks. The last half-hour should be fun.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>63 mins:</strong> West Ham seem to want this a bit more than Arsenal, but Arsenal seem still to have more quality and seem more likely to snatch it. Scott Parker crumples to the turf on the half way line, apparently damaging an ankle when Nasri collapses on top of him. He hobbles off for more treatment.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>66 mins:</strong> Scrappy stuff in the West Ham box with desperate defenders throwing themselves in the way of shots from Fabregas and then Song. Arsenal win a corner as Wenger replaces Nasri and Walcott with Diaby and Adebayor. And the latter's first touch is almost a goal: he jumps highest and gets onto the corner, but heads wide. \"What is it about this Arsenal side that makes one constantly uneasy?\" wonders Amir Adhamy. \"Compare Bentdner to Bergkamp, Song to Vieira... I'm worried. We get more and more lightweight every year.\" I'm not sure they're really fair comparisons, Amir. The two you mention are two of the all-time greats. But I reckon you've answered the first part of your question yourself. \"By the way, I have food poisoning, so am experiencing this game under the duress of sickness.\" There you go.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>69 mins:</strong> Arsenal are turning the screw here now and have pegged back West Ham into their own box. With or without Bergkamp and Vieira, Arsenal are hugely dangerous when they're camped on the edge of the area, and West Ham could be in trouble here. They concede a corner off Collins and then - thump - Van Persie dances across to the middle from the right and unleashes an all mighty thunderbolt that Green, diving left, does exceptionally well to palm out.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>73 mins:</strong> It is all Arsenal and - thump - Van Persie sizes up a free kick from 28 yards and thunders it past Green but onto the post! You can't get much closer than that.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>74 mins - Goal! West Ham 0-1 Arsenal</strong><br>You can't say that wasn't coming. The sustained pressure from Arsenal finally unsettles Faubert, who diverts an Adebayor cross/shot past his own keeper from three yards. Green has kept them in it thus far, but after Adebayor evades the attention of three defenders he's able to scuff that shot goalward. It's going wide, but Faubert sticks his foot out to stop it reaching Bendtner, and in it goes.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>77 mins:</strong>Luis Boa Morte comes on to replace Scott Parker, Matthew Etherington is on for Di Michele. West Ham kick off, finally.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>79 mins:</strong> Arsenal now seem happy to take the sting out of the match by playing those casual passes around the midfield. But a loose one from Diaby sets Bellamy ascamper, and he stumbles over in the box. No foul.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Still Green stands firm against the Arsenal onslaught, and this one would have been a cracker but for the England goalkeeper. Bendtner is free down the left, he cuts it back to Adebayor who, full throttle, takes it away from the defender and thwacks one goalward. Green, full length to his right, parries, and Adebayor puts the rebound over.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>82 mins: </strong>Faubert clatters into Bendtner and Arsenal have a free kick wide on the left. It's lifted in, across, and over the box and goes safe.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>84 mins:</strong> Collins has a much better chance for West Ham than he seemed to first realise. It drops to him on the edge of the box after a long ball is flicked on. Completely unimpeded, he has the time to take it down and drill it past Almunia, but instead decides to slash rashly at it and send it into row X.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>86 mins:</strong> West Ham haven't had many gilt-edged chances here despite Arsenal playing somewhat below par. What's that about winning matches when not playing well? Yeah, that. Faubert is now booked for taking his frustrations out on Bendtner, who has been his tormentor for much of the afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>88 mins:</strong> West Ham have a free kick wide left, just inside the Arsenal box. Shortly before it's taken, the 11-year-old Freddie Sears jogs on to replace the anonymous Lee Bowyer, and the kick is pinged hard into the area. An Arsenal head clears behind, and Bellamy's corner is wasted.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> Three minute of injury time start with Sears having a shot charged down but Aresenal go straight up the other end and...</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 mins+2: GOAL! West Ham 0-2 Arsenal (Adebayor)</strong> As West Ham send everyone forward, a 70-yard ball from the left-back spot (Fabregas-esque, if not actually by Fabregas) picks out Adebayor. He takes it past Green, who sprints out, and fires it in to win the match.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90 mins+3: Red card: Carlton Cole</strong><br>Still enough time for Cole to be sent off, a straight red - an exceptionally harsh decision from Phil Dowd. Cole slides in slightly late on Song, but it's not in any way malicious, not even dangerous, and the sending off (plus three-match ban) is scarcely warranted.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Full time:</strong> The referee Phil Dowd gets a mouthful of abuse from the West Ham bench for the late red card, but Arsenal run out 2-0 victors in east London, and go to within one point of the top. That's it from here. Thanks for your emails. Bye!</p>"
