  "<p>Diego Maradona is set to be unveiled as the new new coach of the Argentina national football team. The news follows a meeting between Maradona and the Argentina Football Association (AFA) president, Julio Grondona, in Buenos Aires. </p> <p>The 47 year-old, who many regard as the greatest footballer to ever grace the game, revealed he was on the verge of accepting the role. \"The offer from Julio Grondona attracted me a lot,\" he said. \"As soon as it is confirmed, I will start working, but I can say I am very proud.\" Maradona, who turns 48 on Thursday, added: \"I'm not the coach yet, but it would be a lovely birthday present.\"</p> <p>If confirmed, the former Boca Juniors, Napoli and Barcelona star will succeed Alfio Basile, who stepped down from the position on October 16 for personal reasons. Pedro Troglio, coach of Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno, claimed he has already been approached by Maradona to become a member of the new Argentina set-up.</p> <p>Reports in Argentina have said that Carlos Bilardo, the coach when Maradona captained the national side to World Cup victory in Mexico in 1986, is also expected to work alongside him as technical secretary, but the AFA is not expected to confirm the coaching set-up until Thursday.</p> <p>Sergio Batista, coach of the Argentina under-20 side, was believed to be in the frame for the position as well, but Maradona's iconic status looks to have been the deciding factor in swaying the AFA's decision. </p> <p>The appointment appears to follow a recent trend within national football associations to install former successful national team players with little coaching experience into the manager's position. Recent examples have been reasonably successful: Jurgen Klinsmann guided Germany to a World Cup semi-final, Marco van Basten ushered in a more youthful Dutch team and Slaven Bilic oversaw Croatia's impressive Euro 2008 qualification before watching his side lose in injury-time in the quarter-final. </p> <p>But Maradona's numerous personal problems, including drug addiction and weight problems, in addition to his limited experience as a coach in just two brief stints at Argentine club sides Racing Club de Avellaneda and Mandiy\u00fa de Corrientes over 10 years ago, would appear to make him a much riskier proposition. </p> <p>Maradona's first match in charge of Argentina is expected to be a friendly against Scotland at Hampden Park later this year.</p>",
  "<p>On election day 2004, <a href=\"http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/davidcorn/\">David Corn</a> and I spent part of the afternoon at a Starbucks near Boston's Copley Square, a couple of blocks from where John Kerry would hold his party that night.</p> <p>For a few brief hours, a Kerry victory looked certain. We wondered whom Kerry might choose to fill his cabinet. And Corn lamented his decision to come to Boston rather than stay in Washington for George W. Bush's bash. Losers, he explained, are always more interesting.</p> <p>So if you are a supporter of Barack Obama, you will have to forgive me today for spraying you with a blast of ice water.</p> <p>Listen to me: Obama might lose.</p> <p>As we head into the final days of the campaign - or the end times, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2203120/\">as Sarah Palin might put it</a> - let me count the ways by which McCain could pull this off.</p> <p>1. Voter suppression. What do you think the McCain campaign's full-scale war against <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/\">Acorn</a> is all about? Acorn, a left-leaning activist organisation, has indeed engaged in voter registration fraud - or, rather, has had registration fraud perpetrated upon it by unscrupulous signature gatherers. But these phony voters are <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/223436.php\">not going to be able to cast ballots</a> unless they show up at the polls with some sort of valid identification.</p> <p>No matter. The Acorn storyline gives the Republicans cover to stop legitimate voters from exercising their right to vote. That's what happened to Al Gore in 2000, when thousands of predominantly African American voters in Florida were <a href=\"http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2000/12/04/voter_file/print.html\">wrongly classified as felons</a> who couldn't vote in that state. And it happened again in Ohio in 2004, where <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen\">Republicans suppressed</a> as many as 350,000 votes.</p> <p>\"The real threat here is the Republican party using attacks on Acorn as a calculated strategy to justify massive challenges to the votes cast in Democratic-leaning voting precincts on election day,\" <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/27/brazile.acorn/index.html\">writes Donna Brazile</a>, Al Gore's 2000 campaign manager.</p> <p>Indeed. Already, the Republicans are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/24/AR2008102403659.html\">challenging the eligibility</a> of some 200,000 newly registered Ohio voters. And in Florida, the voting machines are as <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96183505\">screwed up</a> as they've ever been. Acorn itself reports that <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=12439&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=22412&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=12387&amp;cHash=9aef6579ec\">voter suppression efforts</a> are under way in New Mexico and Michigan.</p> <p>This is the stuff of which liberal nightmares are made. It's unbelievable that it's still going on - or it would be unbelievable until you remember that it benefits the Republicans, who used these tactics to control the presidency for the past eight years.</p> <p>2. The Bradley effect. Nobody knows, it's a different country from 1982, when <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/13/obama.bradley.effect/\">Tom Bradley lost</a> the California governor's race, Obama might benefit from a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1008/A_reverse_Bradley_Effect.html\">reverse Bradley effect</a>, blah blah blah.</p> <p>The fact is, it's possible there are substantial numbers of white voters who won't support a black candidate, but won't tell pollsters that. It won't show up in the exit polls either, because they'll lie to them, too. And voter suppression efforts will serve to hide the whole ugly phenomenon.</p> <p>Granted, there is one strong piece of evidence that the Bradley effect is not in play. The same white voters who say they'll vote for Obama are also saying they'll vote in favour of Democratic Senate and House candidates, some in states that haven't chosen a Democrat in practically forever, like <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081026/ts_alt_afp/usvotecongress_081026193028\">North Carolina and Kentucky</a>.</p> <p>But might these voters decide, in the end, to choose an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress kept in check by a Republican - and reassuringly white - president? Yes, they might. We just don't know.</p> <p>3. Fear and smear. John McCain and Sarah Palin have thrown everything they can find at Obama, accusing him of <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/445/story/847810.html\">hanging out with terrorists</a>, of wanting to turn the Internal Revenue Service <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081025/ap_on_bi_ge/sharing_the_wealth_1\">into a \"welfare\" agency</a> (a convenient opportunity to link a black man to the \"w\" word) and, most recently, of being a <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081027/pl_afp/usvotemccainrights_081027191640\">\"socialist\"</a> who just doesn't understand the life and times of St. Joseph the Plumber.</p> <p>The latest attack arose on Monday of this week, when <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/mccain_slams_ob_3.html\">an old radio interview</a> surfaced on the <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/\">Drudge Report</a> in which Obama said he favoured the \"redistribution of wealth\". The right, predictably, went nuts, though it proves nothing except that <a href=\"http://www.kentucky.com/329/story/568962.html\">Obama supports</a> the 16th amendment to the constitution, approved in 1913. Presumably McCain does, too.</p> <p>In the end, though, this stuff always works, or at least it always has. Obama's ability to remain calm and in control is admirable. But John Kerry remained calm and in control <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/article231.html\">while he was being swift-boated</a>, didn't he?</p> <p>Do I really think McCain can pull this off? No. If I were forced to bet, I'd bet on an Obama victory. He's been <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/todays-polls-1027.html\">too far ahead</a> for too long. This has all the appearance of a race in which people have made up their minds and won't be moved.</p> <p>Still, if McCain wins, I'll only be mildly surprised. We've all lived through this too many times before.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama demonstrated his pulling power by attracting thousands of people to an outdoor rally in torrential rain today in Pennsylvania, a state on which John McCain has staked almost all of his hopes of a surprise win next Tuesday's election.</p> <p>Confirming Pennsylvania's pivotal position on the electoral map, McCain was also in the state, campaigning alongside his running-mate, Sarah Palin, who told a crowd of about 10,000: \"It is going to come down to the wire here.\"</p> <p>Although it was one of McCain's best performances in weeks, he is facing polls that put Obama consistently ahead - the latest has Obama on 51% to McCain on 41%.</p> <p>He is also beset by continuing distractions over Palin. Amid persistent rumours of strains between his campaign team and her advisers, the Politico website quoted one of his aides, speaking anonymously, describing her as \"a whack job\".</p> <p>With time running out for McCain, Obama today showed how difficult it will be for the Republican candidate to make up ground in the state.</p> <p>In spite of ankle-deep mud and freezing rain, campaign workers estimated about 8,000 people waited for hours for him to arrive in Chester, on the outskirts of Philadelphia, huddled under umbrellas, draped in plastic ponchos and even wearing plastic carrier bags over their shoes.</p> <p>\"This is an unbelievable crowd for this kind of weather,\" Obama told them when he stepped out in a dark rain jacket over jeans. \"If we see this kind of dedication on election day there is no way we are not going to bring change to America.\"</p> <p>Pennsylvania, which has voted for Democrats in every presidential election since 1988, is the only Democratic state where McCain is still strongly competing.</p> <p>In spite of a commanding lead over McCain in the polls, Obama's main ally in the state, the governor, Ed Rendell, has been warning the campaign not to take Pennsylvania for granted. Although Obama is ahead overall, detailed polls show the several key counties have tightened in McCain's favour over the last week and the two are now in a dead heat.</p> <p>McCain is also pinning his hopes on white, working-class voters reluctant to turn out for Obama for a variety of reasons, including race. But many of them are angry over the economy and the blame they attribute to the Republicans outweighs their own lingering prejudices.</p> <p>McCain's rally was indoors, at the Giant Arena, in Hershey, the central Pennsylvania home of the chocolate bar, and, after days of only attracting derisory crowds, he almost filled the 12,000-seat ice hockey stadium.</p> <p>McCain appeared to be reinvigorated and, after weeks of floundering, to have settled on a consistent message portraying Obama as a socialist and untested in a crisis.</p> <p>Seeming to address the reports of tension between his and Palin's teams, McCain, standing only a few feet from her, said: \"When two mavericks join up we don't agree on everything, but it's a lot of fun.\"</p> <p>Areas like Hershey are where the election could be won or lost, with residents saying the town is fairly evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>To loud cheers from a boisterous crows, McCain said: \"We are going to fool the pundits and win Pennsylvania.\"</p> <p>McCain took a swipe at Obama over the million dollars he is spending on a half-hour paid-for television address tomorrow night, unprecedented in US political history. It will held before a World Series baseball game, delaying the start, to the irritation of some fans.</p> <p>\"By the way, no one will interrupt the World Series for an infomercial when I'm president,\" McCain said.</p> <p>In spite of a standing ovation, many in the audience had come to see not McCain but Palin, who received the loudest cheers. Some of the audience left after she has spoken and before McCain had a chance to begin.</p> <p>In spite of Obama's turn-out today, there is a lot of resistance to him in places like Hershey. Kim Condran, 40, a health worker who was at the McCain rally, expressed confidence that McCain can still take Pennsylvania. \"Obama is not a truthful person. I don't think he is revealing everything in his past. He has too many connections to foreigners, the bad ones,\" she said.</p> <p>McCain and Palin had a good turn-out given the event was early in the morning, that it was a working day and the rain was heavy. But McCain opted against putting to the test whether he is capable of drawing, like Obama, an outdoor crowd in heavy rain, cancelling such an event later in the day in Quakertown, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Pennsylvania's two major cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are expected to vote heavily for Obama, while McCain hopes to wrap up the small towns and rural areas sandwiched between them.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, the Obama camp is worried about long lines at polling stations and other disruptions in battleground states.</p> <p>Voting rights advocates in Pennsylvania have filed law suits to demand that state election officials increase their supply of paper ballots, and have reserves of trained poll workers on hand.</p>",
  "<p>\"Things are bad but we're doing well.\" So former Argentine president Carlos Menem liked to say, just before his country plummeted into its worst financial meltdown seven years ago. </p> <p>Latin America's leaders appear to be slow learners. As finance ministers emerged from crisis talks in Brasilia yesterday, Venezuela's parliamentarians voted themselves a 42% pay increase. </p> <p>Yet the region's stockmarkets are tumbling, international finance is drying up, currencies are depreciating and jobs are under threat. Latin America's 579 million people have good reason to fear the worst.</p> <p>\"Latin America's presidents are trying to reassure their people, but the global slowdown is already being felt,\" says Lynne Walker, vice-president of the Institute of Americas, a San Diego-based thinktank. </p> <p>In Brazil, the region's largest economy, the value of the local Bovespa stock exchange has halved this year, while the currency has fallen more than 30% against the US dollar.</p> <p><strong>Danger signs</strong><br>A freeze in liquidity represents the most immediate and worrying trend for the region, where average yearly growth rates have averaged 5.6% over the past four years. </p> <p>As the world slides into recession, export orders are decreasing rapidly. For countries heavily dependent on US trade, notably Mexico and Central America, the pinch is hurting. </p> <p>Major investment projects are also paying the price of tighter capital markets. Plans for a $6bn port project in Mexico, a $2.2bn cellulose plant in southern Brazil and a $1.5bn fast-speed train in Argentina are among those now stalled. </p> <p>Add to that the decline in commodity prices and Latin America's export-oriented economies suddenly look to be tottering on the edge of an abyss. The price of copper, for instance, a major factor in Chile's stellar growth in recent years, recently slumped to four-year lows. </p> <p>\"Commodities like soya, gold, copper and oil have helped fund the region's boom,\" says Walker, who describes their recent decline as \"very serious indeed\". </p> <p>Oil dependency presents a stark example. Venezuela and Mexico respectively depend on oil for around 50% and 40% of their federal budgets. The maths is not difficult: a 50% reduction in the oil price, as has occurred since the highs of July, translates into a 50% reduction in government revenue. </p> <p>Remittances are also down. In August alone, money sent to Mexico from the US fell by 12.2%, according to figures from the country's central bank. </p> <p><strong>Reasons for optimism</strong><br>It's not all doom and gloom. Efforts to diversify the region's economies are taking the edge off the crisis, says Rodrigo Sales, a Sao Paulo based analyst. Latin American exports to the US have dropped from 57% in 2000 to 40% in 2007, figures from the Council on Hemispheric Affairs indicate. Over the same period, trade with Asia has increased from 4% to 20% of total exports. </p> <p>\"The fact that Brazil has diversified its exporting platform and isn't dependent on one or two markets has been very helpful in terms of its position before the current crisis,\" says Sales. </p> <p>The Brazilian government has been quick to restore confidence as well, offering loans at market interest rates to companies that are unable to refinance debts due to depreciation of the Brazilian real.</p> <p>Other countries have followed suit. In Colombia, for example, the Bank of Foreign Trade has issued a special credit option to try to encourage international loans. </p> <p>Latin America's foreign currency coffers are also looking healthier. The commodity boom has helped the region's governments squirrel away $460bn in the past four years, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. </p> <p><strong>Regional split</strong><br>Not all the region's policy makers have stuck to the path of prudence, however. Last week, Argentine president Cristina Kirchner announced the proposed nationalisation of the country's $29bn private pension industry. The move sent local markets into a tailspin, wiping 27% off the value of the domestic stockmarket in a mere three days. </p> <p>\"In the case of Argentina the default flag is being raised,\" warns David Duarte, Latin American economist at 4cast, a US firm of analysts. </p> <p>Venezuela's prospects are also looking shaky. Despite considerable foreign assets held by the state-oil company PDVSA, analysts question the liquidity of such investments. </p> <p>Nor does president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela's self-styled \"21st century socialist\", show much political will to rein in escalating public expenditure \u2014 a measure many economists view as critical to resolving the country's escalating balance of payments problem. </p> <p>Colombia is also in the \"at risk\" category, according to Duarte. The market-friendly country is struggling with major current account and fiscal deficits. As a staunch defender of the US, however, it's unlikely that multilateral lenders such as the World Bank will allow a key regional ally to fail. </p> <p>\"What we're seeing is a pattern of countries such as Brazil, Chile and Mexico where prudent monetary and fiscal policies have provided them with the cushion to get by over the next couple of years,\" says Duarte. </p> <p>Then there's the rest. The future for the region's second-tier countries is less clear. Carola Sandy, a Latin American analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, says: \"The countries that had a weaker performance before are going to have a weaker performance in the future.\" </p> <p>But even those at the bottom of the Latin American heap aren't in as much trouble as other emerging markets, says Sandy. </p> <p>\"It's not that Latin America isn't going to be affected by the credit crunch, but it's going to feel it to a lesser extent than other emerging markets, such as eastern Europe,\" she argues. </p> <p>Lower external debt obligations, smaller current account deficits, steadier consumer spending, less exposure to US mortgage-backed securities and existing restrictions to international credit all stand Latin America in better stead than their developing country peers. </p> <p>Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund predicted growth rates of around 4.5% this year and 3.2% next year, down from 5.5% in 2007. </p> <p>\"We're not telling our clients that Latin America is a disaster \u2026 And while there will be less foreign investment in the future, it won't be zero,\" says Sandy. </p> <p>It's hardly a ringing endorsement. But for a region shaken by constant booms and busts, it's a verdict that many crisis-worn Latin Americans will be happy to settle for.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday October 29 2008.

  "<p>Frank Rich makes a great point in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/28/election-tomasky-frank-rich\">my short video interview</a> with him, which you need to go watch. The GOP is now virtually an all-white party, and being an all-white party in the United States of today is an unmitigated liability. </p> <p>The party hasn't had one non-white federal office holder in several years - not one. John McCain is going to get maybe 5% of the black vote, perhaps 25-30% of the Latino vote, and maybe a slightly larger percentage of the still-small Asian vote. </p> <p>America is just getting more and more racially diverse. It's about 68% white now (we'll have an exact figure at the next census in 2010). But look at it this way. In eight years' time, given the way we elect presidents via the electoral college, it won't be possible - I mean won't be possible - to get 270 electoral votes if you're still this white a party. The big electoral-vote prizes are states that are increasingly racially diverse (and mark my words -- under the right circumstances, even Texas may be a Democratic state in eight years). The older white states are small. </p> <p>That means the GOP will have to change its outlook on immigration and on civil-rights types of questions. But if it does that, it won't be the GOP anymore.</p> <p>Glad it's not my problem.</p>",
  "<p>Illegal immigrants have revved up their efforts to enter Britain unnoticed \u2013 four men from Iraq have been caught trying to smuggle themselves into the UK in a Bentley.</p> <p>UK Border Agency officers based in France discovered the four stowed in a GT model being transported back from the N\u00fcrburgring race track in Germany to the Bentley factory in Crewe.<br> They were caught before the vehicle carrying the luxury car could board a ferry to Dover. UKBA officers spotted high readings of carbon dioxide from the German-registered lorry and opened it up to find a group of four illegal immigrants sitting in a Bentley. They were handed over to the French authorities. UKBA's director, Tom Dowdall, who heads operations in northern France, said: \"It's important we stop would-be illegal immigrants before they reach the UK. That's why we've got hundreds of British immigration officers based at ports in France and Belgium. \"Last year we searched over 1m lorries and prevented 18,000 foreign nationals from crossing the English channel without permission.\" As well as visual checks of vehicles, officers also use heartbeat detectors, carbon dioxide machines and sniffer dogs to find stowaways.</p>",
  "<p>The shift in the balance of economic power to the east is only heightened by what is going on now. </p> <p>Activity in the west - the US and western Europe - is tightening and will tighten further next year. <br><br>The world is not decoupled, so <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC\">BRICs</a> \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China - and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Eleven\">\"Next 11\"</a> - Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey and Vietnam - will tighten too. China and India are growing at 10% and we in the west have been struggling to grow at 2% to 3% and will struggle further. </p> <p>The point is, even if the BRICs and Next 11 are coupled and are affected by the terrible events of the past year or so and, in particular, the past four or five weeks, these faster growing markets will remain faster growing. Even if China and India \"collapse\" to 5% or 6%, or 7% or 8% growth, they will still be growing stronger and faster than we are. </p> <p>In this connection, it is interesting to note that the World Bank or IMF still forecast 2% to 3% GNP growth for the world next year, with the US and western Europe flat and the BRICs and Next 11 growing at around 6%. </p> <p>These thoughts have been confirmed by visits to Brazil and Argentina earlier this month, where it seems that growth next year, stimulated by agrarian-based economies, may be 3%. It could be that the ripples - or should we say waves - of economic distress have not reached these countries yet.</p> <p>However, it does seem as though the faster growing economies will continue to be faster growing - particularly when compared with the west.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/sirmartinsorrell\">Sir Martin Sorrell</a> is chief executive of marketing services group <a href=\"http://www.wpp.com/wpp/\">WPP</a></strong></p>",

  "<p>First, an apology. There are so many important moral issues raised by this month's mainstream music publications that the in-depth analyses of <em>Art-Rocker </em>and <em>Plan B</em>, which numerous Inky Fingers correspondents (not all of them co-editors of the former magazine) have been demanding, will just have to wait a little while longer. </p> <p>Second, a few words of unqualified praise. It is a rare thing for any newspaper or magazine to respond to a bad set of circulation figures by making a deliberate shift upmarket. But that is exactly what <em>Q</em> \u2013 not a title historically known for its willingness to take risks \u2013 appears to have done. The classy new typeface bids to establish a previously unremarked kinship with <em>The New Yorker</em>. Longish profiles of Will Self and Barack Obama (\"Like U2 or the Rolling Stones,\" the latter piece asserts reassuringly, \"Obama has been filling stadiums across America and around the world\") telegraph an audacious sneak attack on the unclaimed middle ground between Uncut and Prospect. And AC/DC's Angus Young is an exemplary choice of cover star \u2013 especially following so hard on the road-calloused heels of Metallica (anyone would think these people were taking metal seriously), and with <em>Mojo</em> apparently stuck on an endless circle-line trip from the Beatles to the Clash and back again. </p> <p>Inevitably, as with any redesign, there is the odd teething problem. Readers with fading eyesight may wonder whether the savage migraines induced by the almost-too-small-for-comfort typeset are worth incurring just to read 200 more of Rob Fearn's words about the new album by Keane. And the usually reliable Michael Odell's attempt to re-launch the \"Who the Hell does\u2026 think he/she is?\" interview slot at the front of the magazine (this used to be <em>Q</em>'s signature feature, when the charismatically unsteady hand of Tom Hibbert was on the tiller) is too busy hedging its bets to actually take a proper gamble. Once you've opted to give a platform to the famously grandiloquent Will Self, it seems a bit churlish to take him to task for using too many long words. </p> <p>Living proof that while (if F.Scott Fitzgerald is to be believed, though, frankly, on this point I'm not sure that he is) there are \"no second acts in America lives\", the career of a British music journalist can have a third, fourth and fifth, as well as an encore, is David Quantick. Having seemingly moved smoothly into a showbizzy semi-retirement of Radio 4 panel games and <em>TV Burp</em> gag-supply, no one would have expected this jocular mainstay of the mid/late Eighties <em>NME </em>to return as one of the most divisive figures in British rock journalism, a veritable Peter Mandelson of the picture by-line. But that is exactly what's happened over the past nine months or so.</p> <p>Quantick began the year with a series of imposingly stringent reappraisals of Eighties indie icons in <em>The Word</em>, the most acerbic of which (a full frontal assault on Morrissey's greatest hits) attracted the twin accolades of praise from this column and a lawsuit from the ex-Smiths singer's industrious legal team. Presumably considered too hot to handle by his former employers, he then became a key link-man in <em>Q</em>'s repositioning, first channelling his courtroom frustrations into a perplexingly vicious attack on the new Streets album, and then embarking on a series of those old-school <em>Q</em>-style articles where the journalist is photographed doing something embarrassing (in the October issue this meant striving to emulate Mike Skinner's superior physical fitness by employing the services of a rock star's personal trainer; in this month's it's walking around Soho dressed as Angus Young - a slightly awkward conceit which does at least provide the once-in-a-lifetime pay-off line \"from those about not to be dressed up as you any more \u2013 I salute you\").</p> <p>While the world awaits David Quantick's next move, this month's biggest talking point is supplied by a journalist whose institutional status is even more clearly established. Fred Dellar has been learnedly dispensing information about Eel Pie Island and the first rock festival since just after the last ice-age (and long may he continue to do so). But his column in this month's Mojo demonstrates the dilemma facing the 21st century music press as starkly as the ominous clunk of a falling stalactite signals rapidly rising sea-levels.</p> <p>Under the heading Download Blues, Dellar suggests that the advent of the illegal internet-enabled musical acquisition \"brought a whole new meaning to the word freeloading\". Of course, the old meaning of the word \"freeloading\" was as closely bound up with the profession of rock journalism as \"gazump\" is with estate agency. And Dellar's anguished restatement of the music industry's now largely abandoned zero-tolerance policy on downloads (\"Much as it pains me to admit it, The Man was right\u2026\") would carry more conviction if it came from someone who had received slightly fewer free albums over the last aeon.</p> <p>But this isn't just a matter of people who live in glass houses being better advised not to throw stones. Clearly visible within the ruined greenhouse of Dellar's intellectual position is a thriving tomato plant of enlightenment. For if his argument looks like a last-ditch attempt to defend the rock journalist's ancestral rights not only to hear new music before everyone else but also to do so without paying against the democratising impact of the internet (which it does), might this not imply that the free download has made music journalists of us all?</p> <p>On a practical level the consequences of this seismic shift can already be discerned in the music press's increasingly desperate struggle to defend its dwindling sphere of influence against the barbarian hordes of the blogosphere. And it is in this context that the traditional print media's ambivalent attitude towards the internet can most easily be understood. Elsewhere in the same edition of<em> Mojo </em>as Fred Dellar's Canute-like stand against the encroaching digital tide, a leaked version of Rat Patrol From Fort Bragg \u2013 Mick Jones's fabled original mix of <em>Combat Rock</em> \u2013 is conspiratorially described as being \"just an internet search away\". Yet the apparent contradiction between these two opposing approaches to what are still sometimes quaintly termed \"new media\" can be quickly reconciled with the help of a second application of that trusty proverb about people who live in glass houses.</p> <p>The music magazine which reminds its readers too often that a broadband connection is the only key they need to unlock the bounteous treasure-house of 21st-century pop is essentially playing fast and loose with its own future. As the crimson-tinted balance-sheet of short-lived (but unexpectedly well-written) download-led publication<em> Rip and Burn </em>testified, the rock press's survival in physical form is contingent upon the enduring allure of the artefact.</p> <p>Anyone who doubts this need only consider how closely associated Britain's best known pop and rock publications were with particular physical formats. For the <em>NME </em>of the late Seventies it was the vinyl single and album; for <em>Smash Hits</em> in its early Eighties pomp, the cassette single and 12-inch took centre-stage; for <em>Q</em> the CD established a new benchmark of character-free audio reproduction; while<em> Mojo </em>rejoiced in the advent of the lavishly-annotated boxed set. </p> <p>It's a measure of the extent to which the live show has superseded the recorded album as the music industry's primary income generator that the closest the 2008 vintage <em>NME</em> comes to a totemic object is probably a Reading or Leeds Festival wristband. And the breathless 'you were there, and we were too' tone of that paper's coverage of such events reflects the rapidly narrowing divide between punter and critic \u2013 an aesthetic restructuring whose consequences have yet to be fully understood.</p> <p>In theory, such a bouleversement of rigid intellectual hierarchies can only be a positive development. And yet, if the privileges which were once the exclusive domain of a self-styled media elite are now open to all, surely this renders the listening population at large susceptible to those very moral failings \u2013 cynicism, ennui, an ill-founded sense of infinite entitlement \u2013 which were once the rock hack's particular button-badges of shame? </p> <p>To end on a more upbeat note, this month's Guy Garvey-adorned edition of <em>The Word</em> actually manages to put a perversely enjoyable twist on the disturbing notion that 'we are all music journalists now'. By subjecting the alleged experts from Britain's national newspapers to a 'Rock-boffin Face-off', this heroically self-indulgent double-page spread gives readers the opportunity to match wits with such leading inheritors of Robert Christgau's mantle as <em>the Daily Express</em>' Robert 'These questions really are quite hard' Spellman and <em>the Sunday Telegraph</em>'s James Delingpole (whose response to the enquiry 'Carl, Graham, Lee, Mark, Mike, Dan and Chris. Which group?' is a lovably Bertie Wooster-ish 'Hmmm. I'm going to have to say the Byrds').</p> <p>As an occasional employee of guardian.co.uk, it is my professional duty to report that our own Alexis Petridis annihilates the opposition with a score of 13 to his closest pursuers' relatively paltry eight. Though one of these nearest would-be rivals (<em>The Times</em>' Peter Paphides) loses about a million points for compounding his ignorance of the individual identities of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band with a perplexing 'I'm proud not to know that.' Like the literary critic who boasts of never having read Kafka, the music journalist who congratulates himself on not recognising the name Zoot Horn Rollo would do well to have something special to offer in whatever field he does consider to be his real area of expertise.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>The House of Commons defence / foreign affairs committee is asking questions of <strong>David Miliband</strong> and <strong>John Hutton</strong> today.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>2:36pm:</strong> The first question is an assessment of the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Hutton says the situation in Basra, northern Iraq, is \"better\". He pays tribute to the armed forces.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2:38pm:</strong> There's no doubt at all in my mind that the situation is completely transformed, he says. He's just been out there. He says his own security was entirely provided by Iraq security forces.</p> <p>In the south, it's also better, though al-Qaida continues to pose a serious threat.</p> <p>The general situation is better now than it has been for several years. Miliband says he agrees with that.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2:40pm:</strong> A question on the length of time troops will be needed in future from Sir Menzies Campbell. Hutton says it's important to complete the training of the 14th Iraq troop division. British troops are doing a sterling job helping to train up the homeland forces out there. The other part of the mission is to complete handover of Basra international airport and he says he believes that can happen by the end of the year.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2:42pm: Sir Menzies Campbell</strong>, the former Lib Dem leader, presses Hutton further. Hutton says the government has no intention of maintaining forces in Iraq if the missions are completed. There might be an ongoing role for UK forces as we move to more \"normal\" bilateral forces, he says. </p> <p>But he hopes all can be reviewed in the early part of next year. That, however, depends on the security situation. If that deteriorates, everything might be changed. We hope by the early part of next year we can make some serious decisions about the forces in Iraq, he says.</p> <p>Campbell, whose party opposed the invasion of Iraq, then gets an answer from Miliband, who says you have to look at transition on all fronts: political, economic, and so on. It means the debate on Iraq takes place on a rather broader base, he says.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2:44pm:</strong> <strong>James Arbuthnot</strong>, the shadow trade secretary, asks about security and control. Hutton says he spoke to the Iraqi prime minister. He is in favour of the training of Iraq forces and is completely satisfied with the role of UK forces. </p> <p>We would support Iraqi forces in \"hard\" security operations if necessary, but the next few months is all about preparing the ground for a fundamental change of missions, he says. It's all very much about a union of minds and there's no discrepancy between the Iraqi government and prime minister and the UK.</p> <p>Arbuthnot challenges this, saying the prime minister seems to be under the impression that UK forces will be out of the fray early next year.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2:46pm:</strong> Hutton says he has not detected anything other than a willingness from Iraqi authorities to reach an agreement within an agreed time frame about the role of UK troops from next year.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2:48pm: Bernard Jenkin</strong> (Con, Essex North) suggests that sizeable as the UK's footprint is in Iraq, it's now too small to make an impact. He refers to the \"charge of the nights\", when the involvement of UK troops paled in comparison to those of the US. </p> <p>Hutton disputes the claim that UK troops made a minimal impact. As far as US troops are concerned, there is cooperation about tactics. Our efforts in Iraq are succeeding, says Hutton, as he once more praises British troops.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2:51pm:</strong> Jenkin says forces have not always been in the loop about operations in Baghdad. Lieutenant General Peter Wall - also giving evidence - chips in to say they found out about the charge of the nights at the same time as the US did. It was quite speedy in coming about, but a rather successful operation, says Peters. </p> <p>There was some outpacing by Iraqi troops, he concedes, but relations between our forces and the 14th division (Iraqi) are good. I don't think we have anything to be circumspect about, he says. The size of the force is appropriate to the task we are there to deliver. Peters goes on to cite the exponential rise in confidence by Iraqi colleagues.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2:53pm:</strong> A question on the state of forces agreement currently being drawn up. is it being done with US forces? Hutton says the text being drawn up between the US and Iraqi forces will be used in the drawing up of the UK's own agreement. This would include all territories, including the navy.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2:57pm:</strong> Back to the suggestion that the Iraqi prime minister would be quite keen to see the back of UK troops sooner rather than later. </p> <p>Wouldn't it be better to redeploy the troops to Afghanistan? Hutton says deployments to Afghanistan would be based on advice from military advisers. There is a strong case for more helicopter assets in Helmand and Afghanistan as a whole but no decisions have yet been made. As far as Iraq is concerned we are focused on completing the mission, he says.</p> <p>Miliband chips in to say that operations like the charge of the nights are focused on Iraqi decisions.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2:58pm:</strong> The ministers are then asked about the \"internments\" in Iraq. </p> <p>Hutton says there has to be an understanding about the UK forces' presence in Iraq by the end of the year. Terms of reference are still under way. </p> <p>If it looks like a state of forces agreement doesn't look likely by the end of the year, then the government will need to look at a roll over of the UN mandate. </p> <p>On detention, there are two detentions in Basra of people who killed two British servicemen; the government would like to turn these men over to the Iraqi courts, but in the interests of the bereaved families, the men need to be tried, and it is frankly time they were, says Hutton.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3:01pm: John Stanley</strong> (Con, Tonbridge and Malling) says removing the one-party regime in Iraq under Saddam Hussein scored a number of hits for human rights, but there have been a lot of downsides too, such as thousands of refugees, women's rights going backwards, and rising criminality.</p> <p>Will we be able to say when we leave that human rights have actually improved? </p> <p>Miliband takes this question, pointing out that the picture is different in different parts of the country. The economy is doing well, due to oil revenues. Democracy is getting stronger, due to a number of legislative moves. The balance of the ledger, in terms of human rights, will be positive, says Miliband. </p> <p>The next five years is about tackling the negative points and boosting the positive ones.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3:05pm:</strong> He points to the constitution for Iraq, which enshrines better rights for women and religious minority groups. Stanley says yes but in real terms, how adequate are these constitutional changes, since women on the ground seem to be having a pretty torrid time.</p> <p>Miliband says it depends where you go in Iraq. The UK government needs to reiterate that such issues need to be taken seriously.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3:11pm:</strong> Miliband draws comparisons between Afghanistan and Iraq, and points to their particular features to make the point that policing in Iraq is more advanced.</p> <p>Hutton is asked the total number of detainees held by British troops since the UK first invaded. Hutton doesn't have the figure to hand. All he can say is there are just two now. </p> <p>Wall says they only pass on detainees when they are confident about those handling the detainees. But are these reassurances valid, he is asked, given the UK's responsibilities under the Human Rights Act regarding the treatment of detainees. Wall says simply: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>Hutton says they do have reassurances that when they do pass on detainees, they expect high standards to be followed and look for guarantees from Iraqi forces.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3:12pm:</strong> Jenkin asks whether the drop in detainees is due to the fact that the British leave it to the US to do the arrests. No, he is told. A question follows about the state of accommodation for troops, and for detainees.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3:13pm:</strong> Miliband says troops, diplomats and aid workers are afforded the most secure accommodation possible of the highest standard possible.</p> <p><strong>Mike Gapes</strong> (Lab, Ilford South) lobs a question about the forthcoming elections in Iraq. How confident are ministers that the elections will be free and fair?</p> <p>Miliband says provincial elections are in January, the national ones in October next year. He says the political manoeuvring going on ahead of the provincials is very encouraging, since this is an ordinary pre-election activity.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3:16pm:</strong> The number of groups positioning for the elections is also encouraging. There is a high degree of confidence that the provincial elections will prove to be a good advert ahead of the nationals next time.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3:20pm:</strong> Gapes says there are still tricky issues, notably deBa'athification. Miliband says some controversial decisions were taken in 2003. Things have moved on. The deBa'athification law is good, but the proof of the pudding will be in the eating (ie application of the law).</p> <p><strong>Ken Purchase</strong> (Lab, Wolverhampton North East) raises economic resources. Could either minister give their assessment on the battle for resources and their fair distribution?</p> <p>Miliband says oil production is now back at pre-2003 levels - a source of massive income for Iraq. The way the UK could help contribute is in the way Iraq deals with neighbours, eg the blockage in Iraqi-Kuwaiti trade. </p> <p>The UK wants to help Iraq improve its capacity for exports. Hutton adds that the work of the Basra commission should help. He wants UK businesses to seek opportunities in Iraq. As our military mission changes, you have to look at the new challenges, he says.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3:25pm:</strong> But the precondition to looking at economic development is the very security that he has been talking about.</p> <p>Purchase says there are serious delays on a law on hydrocarbons, which is holding back companies keen to invest. </p> <p>Miliband admits the hydrocarbon law is in limbo at the moment - it was referred back to an appropriate board but seems to have been stuck for the past 18 months.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3:28pm:</strong> Iran is raised, and particularly insurgents in Iraq. Hutton says its important to check the borders to avoid groups getting back in. </p> <p>The UK doesn't like Iran's support for armed militia who stand outside the political process whose raison d'etre is to undermine the political process.</p> <p>Wall says these groups are less in evidence in Basra than they were a year ago. Nowadays its more to do with criminal activity and a little bit of internecine troubles. However, there is a sense that armed militia are a latent threat and, it is believed, getting endorsement from Iranian.</p> <p>There is a sense that there is Iranian orchestration, says Wall, and a sense too that these groups have not gone away for good.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3:30pm:</strong> Miliband says it's not legitimate for Iran to support these armed groups. Slowly the neighbours of Iraq are coming to terms with the growing strength of Iraq. That is not to say that Iraq is in a position to define all its relationships, but it's in a much better place than three years ago, and even a year ago.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3:33pm:</strong> 0n to internal conflict and the Kurds in Kirkuk. What's the threat of conflict in this disputed area, and what's the plan? Miliband says Iraq remains a deeply violent place. The forces of division are significantly more contained than a year or two ago. Ditto political containment. </p> <p>The benefits of retaining the territorial integrity of Iraq are seen and he has no sense that anyone is trying to pull away from that. Hutton says there are issues in areas such as Kirkuk and Mosul.</p> <p>On the Kurdish situation, Miliband says the Kurds have a lot to gain by staying within Baghdad politics rather than opting out.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3:37pm:</strong> Gapes raises Syria. Miliband met with the Syrian foreign minister yesterday. What support was given to them to cope with refugees? Miliband says he was in talks for three hours, and there was no request for UK financial support. What about Jordan, asks Gapes. Miliband again says this was never raised on the shopping list of requests in bilateral talks.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3:39pm:</strong> The discussion moves on to Afghanistan. Arbuthnot asks both ministers whether the situation is better or worse than last year. The situation is different in different parts of the country, says Miliband. Our forces \"more than hold their own\" and the Taliban are often \"repulsed\" as a result of British tactics. </p> <p>In Kabul, we have seen the high-profile attacks on aid workers, but not on the military, says Miliband. The situation in the east has significantly improved over recent months. In the conventional theatre and confrontation, there hasn't been a situation of the Taliban rolling back on UK gains. Miliband says the Afghans want to hear a clear message that they recognise that the mission is not just military, but also political.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3:44pm:</strong> There are also gains in building up the Afghan national army, which is 60,000 strong at the moment. It is a vital sign of hope. Hutton, who has just been in Afghanistan, says there are reasons, despite the increase in violence, to be clear that the UK is making progress.</p> <p>The progress that struck him most when he was in Helmand province, alongside the great job being done by British troops, was the improvements in the national army, who are showing real signs of progress.</p> <p>He believes there have been reductions in violence in Kabul. It would be a huge mistake to overgeneralise, says Hutton.</p> <p>Arbuthnot says it is ministers' job to set out the narrative to the British public to say: we have right on our side, but also here's the strategy to succeed. He asks what is being done about that. </p> <p>Miliband says the mission is to ensure the Afghans themselves can handle the situation. But, just as he suggested for Iraq, he says the comprehensive approach needs to look at the economic situation, the social and the political, as well as the military.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3:47pm:</strong> Miliband cites the interdependence of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Stability and security in one will not be achieved unless it is also achieved in the other. So it's about the capacity of international forces, and national forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan, to deliver the strategy. He lists some operational improvements, but adds that it is up to the Afghan and Pakistani governments to \"raise their games\". This time last year the two were not working together; this year they are. That's progress.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3:49pm:</strong> <strong>Paul Keetch </strong> (Lib Dem, Hereford) wonders what other Nato forces are doing to play their role. He reads some press cuttings suggesting the situation is in a downward spiral. </p> <p>Miliband says the UK wants more countries to do more. The French government has committed to doing more and being at the heart of the Nato command structure; that is positive. Some smaller EU countries, per head of population, are playing their part eg Croatia (not yet part of the EU, but working on it). Miliband also points out again that this mission is not just military anyway.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3:51pm:</strong> A member from the foreign select committee - (this is a joint session between the foreign and the defence scrutiny committee) asks whether it's true there is only one district under Afghan control. No, says Hutton. Wall says there is a clear \"hold and build\" strategy, which is designed to allow improved governance in the area. There is no point making military gains if you don't build on it and involve the Afghans in the process, he says.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3:53pm:</strong> How big is the area, asks Gapes. It's the main swath of the Helmand valley and encompasses five districts and vast tracts of agricultural land and around six in 10 of the population in the province, he is told. </p> <p>Gapes asks whether it's true some of these areas have reverted to Taliban influence. Wall says no. The progress is incremental, since the effort is about building governance under an Afghan regime.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3:55pm:</strong> That claim of controlling five districts is niggling away. One MP says MPs were told there was control over just one district. The issue of Taliban warlords, who fund private armies is raised. Do they still run these armies?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3:57pm:</strong> Miliband says he tries not to talk about <em>the</em> Taliban. Some are ideologically committed, whereas some are criminals. And insurgency involves not just the Taliban but also al-Qaida criminals. Warlords are not necessarily part of the insurgency. Afghanistan has never had a government in Kabul which held sway across the whole country, he says. But, yes, there are significant armed people funded by narcotics. He mentions the word narco-terrorism to encapsulate the problem.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4:03pm:</strong> Hutton then chips in that there is significant support put in place to help the government deal with narco-terrorism. There is an indissoluble link between narco-terrorism and insurgency. </p> <p>We have to focus on this issue and seek some progress on it. A rather sickly sounding <strong>Adam Holloway</strong> (Con, Gravesham) suggests there is a peasants' revolt in Kabul against government corruption. </p> <p>Hutton disagrees, adding that efforts are being made to help the government. Yes, but what about the corruption, insists Holloway. Miliband says this issue is always raised, and corruption needs to be addressed. He says clean governance at a provincial level will help change the tide. </p> <p>It's important to put on record that Hamid Karzai is the elected leader of Afghanistan and that is why the UK does business with him, Miliband says, and the idea, suggested by Holloway, that he has just one contact in Kabul, is likely to be incorrect. </p> <p>Miliband says the international community have put their views forward on the need to stamp out corruption,and so indeed have the Afghan people.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4:07pm:</strong> <strong>David Heathcoat-Amory</strong> (Con, Wells) asks why the UK government has allowed its aim to become anti-insurgency ie mission creep. if that's the case, UK troops will be tied up for ever. Terrorist threats are not just derived mainly from Afghanistan. It's too far removed from our own security to be a precise war aim against which we can judge our success.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4:11pm:</strong> Miliband is getting a bit irritated now, folding his arms against his chest in response to a question from Campbell.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4:12pm:</strong> Hutton is talking now, about security. To succeed in the counter-insurgency operation we have to succeed in a number of areas, he says, ie politics and governance. </p> <p>Regarding the level of insurgency, we should be realistic about the opponents we are facing. There's going to be a hard core of ideologues left on the ground. We have to give Afghan forces the capabilities to deal with them. If you're not comfortable with al-Qaida and its supporters running the country - and who is - you have to be all the way in in this campaign to be in a position to leave behind forces capable of dealing with the problems on the ground.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>4:14pm:</strong> Campbell says he takes it from that that British forces will stay in Afghanistan as long as necessary. Hutton says, \"Yes.\"</p> <p><strong>Linda Gilroy</strong> (Lab, Plymouth Sutton) asks if enough attention is being paid to winning the propaganda war. Miliband says Afghans do not want to go back to living under the Taliban. they want to know whether we will stick with them. He points out that the media go out there sometimes to do some \"honest reporting\" ie what they see not what they are being told by the military.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4:18pm:</strong> <strong>Robert Key</strong> (Con, Salisbury) tells the ministers he fears that western liberal democracy is so unlikely to flourish in Afghanistan that time might be wasted talking about democracy, rather than focusing on stability. </p> <p>Miliband says that's a profound debate. Does one come before the other, or do they need to happen together? His view is that some of the features of a democratic nation ie elections are an important part of the Afghan situation.</p> <p>But it's important not to read from that that we're trying to impose British suburbia in Afghanistan. We understand the absolute centrality of security but to then say \"Don't bother with a national government\" is not the right view to take, he says. It's important to try to persevere with national elections.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4:21pm:</strong> Jenkin switches to the US presidential election. He says both Barack Obama and John McCain have committed themselves to a \"surge\" in Afghanistan like the one in Iraq. Will Britain be required to send more troops?</p> <p>Hutton says he can't speculate on the request that may or may not be forthcoming. We are pulling our weight, he says. We welcome the additional US forces, but it can't be left to the UK to fill in all the gaps. Jenkin says if there is a commitment to further militarise, you then have to give British troops further resources. Hutton says if he receives advice that more British troops are needed he will look at that carefully but he says \"I have received no such request\" for increased force levels.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4:25pm:</strong> But Hutton concedes there are areas that need looking at, such as helicopters. I'm not going to say there are not areas there to look at but I'm not going to sit here today and speculate about troop numbers, he says.</p> <p>Ministers are told the fear is that \"we appear to be going backwards rather than forwards\" eg NGOs claim that they don't have the free movement they used to have. Hutton takes issue with this. It's a great disservice to put things in these terms. </p> <p>There are fundamental issues that need to be addressed but you will see areas of significant progress, he says. He urges the MPs \"not to fall into the trap of generalising\".</p> <p>The MP tries to explain what he means. Ability to travel is not as it was, he says.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4:29pm:</strong> Miliband picks up the problem with transport on the highways. He says the question of security on the roads has gone up the agenda.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4:32pm:</strong> He mentions the difficulties with policing borders with Pakistan. The Pakistani army is actually quite well-numbered on the border.</p> <p>Gapes asks about the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Mark Lyall Grant, the director general political of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who is also on the panel, is asked about how optimistic he is about relations. </p> <p>Grant says Pakistan needs some help with the economy. But there is a strategic opportunity under the new prime minister now in place. Stanley asks the geographic area over with Karzai has control. Is it as low as 20%?</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>4:35pm:</strong> No, says, Miliband, I wouldn't. Stanley's point is that the scale of the task means \"we're in it for the long haul\".</p> <p>Listing a number of countries, such as Canada and Australia, who are on the brink of pulling out, Stanley asks Miliband to confirm the number of countries in it for that long haul. </p> <p>Miliband says the German government has just agreed to increase its military - as well as aid - contribution. You raise a serious point vis a vis how the burden is shared amongst countries, says Miliband, but it's worth reflecting that a country that probably had the biggest debate about troop involvement, Germany, has just made its commitment. </p> <p>It's right to say it's tough and difficult, but I don't think it's right to say we are the last ones on the bridge, the foreign secretary says.</p> <p>Stanley says all he asked was how many other countries had said they were committed to being there for as long as it takes.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4:37pm:</strong> Miliband says there is widespread recognition that this is a long haul. No one is under the impression it's a quick fix.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4:41pm:</strong> Purchase recalls the mantra: \"If we don't go to Afghanistan, Afghanistan will come to us.\" This is true of terrorism, but also of the drug trade, he says. Shouldn't we really be putting a great deal of effort into stopping the trafficking routes that are well-known in Afghanistan to stop the trade of narcotics?</p> <p>Hutton agrees. the target should be narco-traffickers not the small farmers. He cites the decrease in opium production and cultivation. The problem has quite manifestly not being resolved, and there is a shared concern with Afghan police that we have to seriously tackle the problem. </p> <p>With that the two-hour session draws to a close.</p>",
  "<p>\"What are you looking for?\" Our heads turned. We were bent over our canvassing packet, trying to figure out where our tally went wrong. Turns out I failed to notice that Patterson was the street after 30th, not 31st. I had messed up the list of doors assigned to us. We'd have to go back. \"We're knocking doors for Obama,\" I shouted back. \"Who are you voting for?\" He was youngish, maybe mid-thirties, wearing a faded Red Sox baseball cap and standing next to a pickup truck emblazoned with Ron Paul bumper stickers. When he heard my reply, he stiffened. </p> <p>\"I'm sure as hell not going to vote for any nigger!\" he shouted and disappeared into his driveway. </p> <p>This is a real story, and it happened here in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie\">Erie, Pennsylvania</a>. It isn't typical of Erie \u2013 this was the first and only time something like this has happened in the city since I moved here from Montana and started volunteering for the Obama campaign, but it gives me permission to express the frustration I've felt about the city's tepid embrace of Barack Obama.</p> <p>Erie sits atop the thumb of Pennsylvania land that reaches up and kisses Lake Erie. The city proper has about 100,000 people; the greater metropolitan area, 240,000. Erie lies at the center of a triangle of northwestern cities: Cleveland to the west, Buffalo to the northeast, and Pittsburgh to the south. Wracked by wind and deep snow in the winter, it's an industrial city \u2013 or it was an industrial city. In the 20th century it was a shipbuilding center, a railroad hub and a producer of steel and iron until \u2013 like elsewhere in the Midwest \u2013 the jobs dried up when the factories went overseas. </p> <p>Tucked among the parks and lines of single-family homes and cracked sidewalks are the ruins of steel plants and immense warehouses overgrown with weeds. At the end of the school day, kids in Catholic school uniforms crowd the ice cream shop and teen joggers run in packs along park paths. Eerie is <a href=\"http://www.visiteriepa.com/\">quickly becoming a tourist town</a>. The city's main attraction is Presque Isle, a park on a spit of land jutting out into the lake and ringed with beaches and bike paths, and Ohioans, Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers flock on the summer weekends for the water slides, amusement parks and the cool breezes and water of a lake swim. There's a new library on the waterfront where the replica of the brig Niagara floats. It was built to honor the battle of Lake Erie in the war of 1814 where Commodore Perry defeated a British squadron and secured Detroit for the fledgling US. Perry wrote the famous words to his superiors, \"we have met the enemy and they are ours,\" a slogan not befitting the town, which seems more resigned or weary than assertive and accomplished.</p> <p>This is a union town and a Democratic city, with <a href=\"http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080930/NEWS02/309309939/-1/ELECTION&amp;template=election\">registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans</a>, 99,500 to 62,000. But it's an aging blue-collar town with a high percentage of Catholics, the kind of place Barak Obama struggled with during the primaries. Senator Hillary Clinton won <a href=\"http://www.eriecountyelections.com/assets/results_chart_erie.pdf\">62% of Erie's vote</a> during the Pennsylvania primary.</p> <p>My experience knocking on doors makes it obvious this is the kind of town that should go for Obama in a big way. The main issues? Health care, the economy and the war. In short, they're alarmed by rising health care costs, jobs going overseas, and angry with the Bush administration for tricking us into Iraq. A lot of them depend on disability, Medicare and social security. A lot of them shake their heads over the bail-out. They don't like McCain's talk of lower corporate taxes, his health care plan and his eagerness to take on Iran and Spain. But there are undecided voters abound. And <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/PAFieldOffices/\">Erie's Obama headquarters</a> have few regular volunteers from Erie itself. Instead to make the door and phone quotas, volunteers drive in on the weekends from New York, Ohio and Pittsburgh. </p> <p>That's not to say that Erie lacks supporters for Obama. Far from it. Yard signs proliferate. On the phone, the union men are angry with Republicans and fired up to put an ally in the White House. At the doors, Obama supporters greet his canvassers with excitement, perhaps even relief. Still, there's a palpable resistance, especially on the lower west side in the middle-class white neighbourhoods where I spend my Sundays knocking on doors.</p> <p>\"He doesn't inspire me,\" said one woman, puttering around her yard in the waning days of summer. \"I haven't really gone for a candidate in a long time.\" Who was the last candidate that inspired you? She stopped and mulled this over. \"JFK,\" she said. But what separates the two men, really? Isn't Obama the JFK of the upcoming generation? The answer hangs between us, unspoken.</p> <p>Another woman, an undecided voter in a Steelers jersey, admits that it's the name that keeps her from opting for Obama. \"I mean, 'Obama,'\" she says. \"It's a lot like, 'Osama,' you know?\" I patiently explained Obama's personal history, mentioned that he was brought up by his white grandparents in Hawaii and spent time in Chicago working as a community organiser in neighborhoods struggling with steel plant closings. She smiled, a brilliant flash of white and freckled cheeks, and two golden retrievers came barreling out the door with tails wagging. A child runs around the corner. \"I'm sorry, mom,\" the child said, \"they got away from me\".</p> <p>Another man, visibly angry about the bail-out explained his reluctance to commit to Obama this way: \"I wish he would talk like one of us,\" he said. He wanted Obama to talk tougher. He's so ... so ... \"Eloquent?\" I offered. \"Uppity,\" said the man.</p> <p>It's not exactly racism \u2013 at least, not the virulent kind expressed by the Ron Paul supporter in Pittsburgh \u2013 but it's not exactly not racism, either. It's a kind of unspoken uneasiness with Obama's \"otherness\". It's his name, his skin color and his background - all of which have been distorted and exaggerated in email chains, on conservative radio talk shows, and, lately, fanned by the McCain campaign.</p> <p>Is this the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">\"Bradley effect\"</a> in action? You know, the theory that there's a discrepancy between opinion polls and election results for black candidates, because people are less likely to admit their prejudice to a pollster than act on them in the privacy of a voting both? Not likely: for one, it seems the days of the Bradley effect <a href=\"http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~dhopkins/wilder13.pdf \">are long-gone</a> (pdf). For another, conservative rhetoric has armed voters with the vocabulary to express prejudice to pollsters without using racist language. \"Uppity,\" \"risky,\" worries about his \"background,\" are all coded language expressing uneasiness with the Democratic candidate, and reflect a level scrutiny that McCain is largely free from.</p> <p>Instead, it seems likely that this disquiet at many doors in Erie, and reluctance to eagerly support the Democratic candidate may be the result of a \"partially negative view of blacks\" that a recent <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/22/race.politics/\">CNN/Yahoo study on race</a> in the 2008 election identified in whites, and a view that may alter the outcome of the election by at much as 6 points in McCain's favor. Again, it isn't out-and-out racism; it's subtler and more malleable, easier to dislodge.</p> <p>That's the premise of this week's <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/current\">Time Magazine</a>, which examines race in context of this year's election. In its story, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1848769,00.html\">\"Race and Brain\"</a>, science provides hope that race can be overcome. It's simple, really. \"The more you think about people as individuals,\" cognitive neuroscientist Liz Phelps was quoted as saying, \"the more the brain calms down.\" Go to the doors, and tell people about Barack Obama's story. Keep going back until either they get it, or they associate Obama with you.</p> <p>And certainly Time's cover story, arguing that the sagging economy is <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1848469,00.html\">pushing race prejudice to the side</a>, rings true here in Erie. On my last jaunt through Erie just yesterday and among undecided and \"sporadic\" voters, the reaction was positive toward Obama and all about the economy. </p> <p>Yes, a teenage girl shouted at us as we passed by, \"I wouldn't vote for him; he sounds like a terrorist!\" But consider this: we recognised the two boys sitting with her. They had come down to Obama's Erie campaign office to volunteer.</p>",
  "<p>Jibril Rajoub doesn't look like a man you'd want to mess with. His large, imposing frame and bullet-like bald head make the new president of the Palestinian Football Association resemble an ageing prizefighter, which in some ways he is. Whilst most football administrators cut their teeth in bureaucratic hell, Rajoub has a far more colourful and controversial past.</p> <p>By the age of 17 he had been sentenced to life in jail for throwing a grenade at Israeli troops. At 33 he was exiled to Lebanon and by the time of the second intifada he had risen through the Fatah ranks to become Yasser Arafat's trusted national security adviser, building a reputation as the West Bank's internal 'hard man' while also being known as a political moderate opposed to attacks on Israeli soil. Yet for the past six months Rajoub has been involved in one of the hardest scraps of his life: trying to bring international football to Palestine for the first time.</p> <p>This weekend was a momentous occasion for the Palestinians after it was announced that, finally, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/25/palestine-jordan-football-match\" title=\"\">the national team would be allowed to play a home game in the West Bank</a>, a remarkable feat almost entirely attributable to Rajoub, who has had to overcome more than a decade of failure, exile and broken dreams. Yet when Fifa tentatively recognised Palestine in the mid 1990s, it was a cause for massive celebration in the West Bank and Gaza. Fifa was, after all, one of the only international bodies to recognise Palestine's existence.</p> <p>Games couldn't be played at home, Fifa deemed it too dangerous, but there was no shortage of Arab capitals willing to show Palestinian solidarity, and Amman and Doha became their new home as the team launched a bid to reach the World Cup finals. Qualification, the Palestinians reasoned, would be a damn sight more effective for the cause of national self-determination than almost anything else. By 2004 they were ready for a crack at the 2006 finals in Germany.</p> <p>It started well for them too. Fifa had relaxed rules on citizenship meaning that the Palestinians could call on their massive Diaspora to fill the team sheet. Adverts were put into magazines in Germany, Chile and the United States to attract players. A multinational squad was assembled, followed by an 8-0 thumping of Chinese Taipei and then a respectable 1-1 draw with Iraq. Then the wheels fell off. </p> <p>Movement restrictions between Gaza and the West Bank, not to mention the restrictions within them, meant the team could rarely train together. Training camps were set up in Egypt, but the players from Gaza would rarely get through Israeli checkpoints. The coaching staff, realising that nine-man training sessions probably weren't great preparation for a World Cup qualifier, started picking more players from the West Bank, breeding resentment amongst the two groups of players and effectively creating two different national teams.</p> <p>The nail in the coffin came when the team was denied permission to leave Palestine to play Uzbekistan. The Palestinians, without their Gaza contingent, could only scrape together 10 players. It was a miracle they lost only 3-0. The campaign was over, the Palestinian dream of statehood through the back door shattered.</p> <p>Palestinian football went into decline. The West Bank's football league was suspended as it was almost impossible to fulfil any fixtures when there were so many checkpoints to negotiate. If the fans managed to get to the game, it was unlikely that one of the teams, or sometimes even the referee, would make it. </p> <p>The Gaza league, though, continued unmolested, one of the few areas other than tunnel construction to benefit from Israel's unilateral pull-out from the strip. The team's efforts to reach the 2010 World Cup finals also ended on the desk of an Israeli bureaucrat. They were eventually eliminated when the team couldn't get visas for a qualifier against Singapore last October.</p> <p>The FA pleaded that movement restrictions had again stopped the players from travelling, but its objections fell on deaf ears and Fifa awarded the match 3-0 to Singapore. Then Rajoub came riding to the rescue in May, driven by his trademark ruthlessness and a single-minded objective of giving Palestine home advantage for the first time in its history.</p> <p>\"From the first moment I was elected as president I started organising to have a match here between our first national team with any team that would play us,\" he explains as multiple phones go off around him. \"In my first meeting with [Fifa president] Sepp Blatter in May, I asked him and the process began. He said OK and would sponsor such a match and then the deputy president [of the FA] of Jordan approached us. </p> <p>\"But to be fair many, many teams approached us to be the first team to play in Palestine but our brothers in Jordan insisted and they deserve to be the first one to play the match because they have helped us so much and contributed to where we are today.\"</p> <p>It's apt that Jordan were the first team to play in Palestine, and not just because Amman became a temporary home for the team. It is estimated that up to 80% of Jordanians are of Palestinian descent, and a number of the players from the national team trace their origins back to the West Bank and what is now modern day Israel. </p> <p>Even Jordan's most popular team, current champions Wihdat, have a strong Palestinian identity. The owner is a Palestinian-born Christian MP in the Jordanian parliament and the club are based in the Palestinian Wihdat refugee camp in Amman. The fan's most popular chant is \"Allah, Wihdat, Al Quds Arabi\" (God, Wihat, Jerusalem [for the] Arabs).</p> <p>Yet it was touch and go whether the match would take place at all. As you'd expect in a part of the world where politics seeps into every action, organising the game had become something of a logistical nightmare. To start with the West Bank has very few grass pitches, let alone stadiums, so a new home for Palestinian football needed to be found. </p> <p>Rajoub began by travelling to Israel and meeting with sympathetic Knesset members to build support for a new national stadium, built next to the Green Line on the edge of East Jerusalem in Al Ram, a stone's throw from the separation barrier that divides the landscape.</p> <p>Palestinian Authority policemen were not allowed to patrol the area so a special deal had to be struck with the Israelis to allow them to police the stadium. Then there was the slew of dignitaries to be taken care of. Blatter was in town to admire his handiwork: it was money from Fifa's Goal project that paid for the stadium's completion. But the main problems giving Rajoub headaches were the same problems that have afflicted all of his predecessors: getting the players to the games.</p> <p>As the national team is split in two, travel permission had to be sought from the Israelis. Six players from Gaza were denied permission to travel to the game, including the team's captain, Saed Jundiyah, who the Israeli's deemed a \"security risk\". </p> <p>The last time I met him, at a football tournament in Jordan last summer, he had the opposite problem: he was stuck in Jordan, denied permission to get back into Gaza. But most worryingly for Rajoub, the Jordanian national team had been detained at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank.</p> <p>While most would buckle under the pressure, Rajoub knows a thing or two about operating under tough conditions. \"Listen, you know my background: I am a Palestinian fighter. Wherever I go I make order and I make action plans,\" he said 48 hours before the match, as his staff made frantic phone calls to try to ease the Jordanians' passage. </p> <p>\"I define what I want and make sure the means are there to assure my ends and my goals. This is what I got as chief of security, national security adviser, and when I was in the underground resistance. I've used the experience of my past and my contacts to ensure we've got what we wanted.\"</p> <p>It was for these qualities that Rajoub secured his almost unanimous election as head of the Palestinian FA, in itself an interesting move given his past and the continuing enmity between Hamas and Fatah factions. He is one of Fatah's most important operators and was even spoken of as a potential president after Yasser Arafat's death. But Islamic Jihad and Hamas have criticised him in the past for instigating occasional purges to halt attacks against Israeli targets.</p> <p>\"There were some concerns,\" Rajoub admitted. \"But I was elected by all the political factions, extreme right, extreme left, PFLP [the left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine], Palestine Democratic Union, everyone. I am proud of that and I think football should not be used to divide and should present all the Palestinian people as one. There is no political affiliation in the team, it is a national issue.\"</p> <p>His stock has risen to such a level that reports earlier this month suggested that he had travelled to Gaza for secret security talks with deposed Hamas prime minister Ismail Haniya. Whether this footballing d\u00e9tente between the two factions spreads to other areas is another issue entirely. </p> <p>Just east over the separation barrier, a little over an hour's drive to the coast, is the Ramat Gan Stadium in Tel Aviv, the home of Israeli football. Palestine might look to Asia, and Israel Europe, but could the two teams ever play each other in Jerusalem in a peace match, I ask. Rajoub is cautious.</p> <p>\"First of all on the national level we are playing an active role to bridge the internal gap between the competing [Hamas and Fatah] factions and I think we are making a success of this but it's up to the Israel,\" he said. \"Do they want peace, security, settlements, checkpoints or occupation? </p> <p>\"The core message we want to give the international community is values, competition without violence and bloodshed. It is up to the Israelis to decide. We cannot co-operate on the one hand and then, on the other, live under restrictions and internal arrest.\"</p> <p>Yet you get the feeling that, with Rajoub at the helm, anything is now possible. He has already achieved more for Palestinian football, and Palestinian national unity, than almost anyone else in the past few years. </p> <p>\"I have a strategy for the next four years [but] I am using all my effort, all my power just to get through the next 48 hours, let me cross this bridge first,\" he explained, no pun intended. \"The Israelis are still preventing the Jordanian national team from crossing over. It's Friday. The match is Sunday so the challenge is very huge. See what can go wrong? Let's see if we make it through the next 48 hours my friend, and then I'll concentrate on what come next.\"</p> <p>And he did make it through. In the end the last-minute diplomacy worked. The Israelis let the Jordanian team through and a packed Faisal al Husseini Stadium reverberated to chants of \"Football is more noble than war\" as Palestine took an early lead, only to be pegged back. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2008/oct/27/palestine-jordan-football\" title=\"\">It finished 1-1</a>, a good result against a team 68 places above them in the Fifa rankings. But, as it always is for Palestine, the result didn't really matter. Walking out on to home turf was victory enough.</p> <p><em>When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone (Mainstream) by James Montague is out now</em></p>",

I bought one for 48 hours and found it very good value for money. I certainly got more than \u20ac43 worth of museum, canal trips and transport from it. You can buy it from Holland Tourist Information at Schiphol by credit card and it makes it easier to work out a budget for the rest of your stay. You can hop on and off the fantastic trams without having to worry about buying and stamping tickets.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iamsterdam.nl/\">I Amsterdam Card</a></p> <h2>Where to eat</h2> <p><strong>De Erste Klasse</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Mark Lawton</strong> <br>Find De Erste Klasse on platform 2b of Amsterdam Central Station and be infused with years of atmospheric rail travel. This huge late 19th-century wood-panelled brassiere is the epitome of European railway romanticism: think Brief Encounter without the tea urn.</p> <p><strong>Cafe Thijssen</strong><br>Posted by <strong>happytraveller</strong> <br>Full of character, situated in the trendy Jordaan area. Excellent Dutch apple cake, and a wonderful array of interesting lunchtime snacks with healthy options. Very reasonably priced as well.

Food like your Dutch granny made for you and served promptly and effectively. The liver and onions had just run out on the specials board as we arrived, so we settled for braised beef, giant meatball, saute pots, cauli and green beans (you select your veg from the specials board). Apple puree, rhubarb and rice pudding custard, rounded off the meal. All in the company of locals (mostly over 70). Great value for \u00a322 with 2 bottles of beer and an apple sap.

Selling about 500 beers from all over the world and specialising in beers from small independent brewers, it's an absolute treasure trove for the beer lover. You can buy Westvleteren there (which is reputedly the best beer in the world and extremely hard to come by), as well as some truly stunning Scandinavian and American beers. Try the Norwegian Porters and Imperial Stouts. Highly recommended.</p> <p>Once you've bought some for later, why not pop into Caf\u00e9 Gollem to try a couple on tap and maybe a Kaasplank (literally a plank with cheese and bread on it). Very satisfying. There's also a second branch of Caf\u00e9 Gollem right by the Albert Cuyp Market in the Pijp district.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Both are on Raamsteeg, 41012; <a href=\"http://crackedkettle.nl/store/\">Cracked Kettle</a>; <a href=\"http://www.cafegollem.nl/default_EN.asp\">Caf\u00e9 Gollem</a></p> <p><strong>Caf\u00e9 Soundgarden</strong><br>Posted by <strong>PhilSen</strong> <br>If dreadlocks, piercing and tribal tattoos are your style, there's Soundgarden. It boasts a surprisingly civilized terrace overlooking the daily ebb and flow of boats and barges, but the inside is almost painstakingly run-down and graffitied, with a buckled pool table and a dartboard pocked with scars. Not as intimidating as it sounds, but hardly appropriate for the blue-rinse brigade.

  "<p>A sudden cold snap hit the UK overnight, with gale-force winds and below-freezing temperatures prompting the first proper blanket of snow for the season in Scotland.</p> <p>Frost, ice and harsh winds buffeted the country, with the Met Office issuing severe weather warnings for Orkney, Shetland, the Highlands and Eilean Siar, and the Grampians, where heavy snow was predicted today.</p> <p>Sleet and snow are expected across Northern Ireland. Forecasters say the conditions could move into Wales and then central and south-east England later on today.</p> <p>\"This is the first real taste of winter,'' Barry Gromett from the Met Office said. \"Yesterday the cold came from straight northerly winds blowing down from the Arctic and the winds are certainly polar in origin.</p> <p>\"The extra moisture from the north Atlantic will increase the frequency of snow showers.''</p> <p>Temperatures are hovering around 1C (34F) in Aberdeen, where snow fell overnight, and 5C (41F) in Glasgow, but the mercury could fall to as low as -6C (21F) overnight. There could be up to 10cm of snow over the mountains.</p> <p>Thousands of residents in Shetland lost their power supply at the weekend, and engineers are still working on repairing the damaged lines.</p> <p>Forecasters said heavy sleet and frost were possible overnight outside London. Temperatures will be slightly warmer by the end of the week, and while the threat of snow showers will have passed, easterly winds will keep temperatures down at the weekend.</p> <p>Road gritters are on standby to keep major motorways clear, and the Highways Agency has warned motorists in the south-west, the north and the West Midlands to beware of reduced visibility and reduce speed because of slushy conditions.</p>",

  "<p>Foreign-born \"preachers of hate\" and other violent extremists will have to prove they have publicly renounced their views or be refused entry to Britain under tough new rules unveiled today.</p> <p>The measures, set out in a written ministerial statement by Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, will make it easier to exclude those who want to come to the UK to stir up religious or racial hatred.</p> <p>Such preachers will be named and shamed, and the exclusion list will be shared with other countries to help them, the Home Office said.</p> <p>Smith said: \"Through these tough new measures I will stop those who want to spread extremism, hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country.</p> <p>\"Coming to the UK is a privilege and I refuse to extend that privilege to individuals who abuse our standards and values to undermine our way of life.\"<br>  The new rules will:</p> <p>\u2022 create a presumption in favour of exclusion in respect of all those who have engaged in fostering, encouraging or spreading extremism and hatred,</p> <p>\u2022 provide that where an individual claims to have renounced their previous extremist views or actions the burden of proof is on them to demonstrate that this is so and that this has been publicly communicated,</p> <p>\u2022 introduce changes that will allow the government to exclude nationals of the European Economic Area, and their families, from the UK, before they travel to this country, if they constitute a threat to public security or policy</p> <p>\u2022 work with other agencies and community groups to improve the evidence base underpinning our exclusion decisions to ensure that we identify those who pose the greatest threat to our society,</p> <p>\u2022 consider in all future cases whether it would be in the public interest to disclose that an individual has been excluded with a presumption to inform the public, and</p> <p>\u2022 make greater use of UK watch lists to ensure that individuals who might fail to be excluded, should they seek to come to the UK, are identified, and any future visa application is considered with full regard to previous extremist activities. <br> The move will cover anti-abortionists, animal rights extremists and neo-Nazis as well as extremist clerics.</p> <p>Since 2005, 230 people have been banned on grounds of national security and for \"unacceptable types of behaviour\", which include fomenting or glorifying terrorism and inciting hatred. Of those, 79 were excluded for unacceptable behaviour.</p> <p>The most high-profile individuals to face exclusion orders include Omar Bakri Mohammed, who was banned in the wake of the July 7 terrorist attacks in the London transport system, and the Egypt-born cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi, banned by the Home Office this year after being described as \"dangerous and divisive\" by David Cameron, the Tory leader.</p> <p>The Home Office anticipates that the new rules will see a larger number of people barred from Britain.</p> <p>The ban rests on the government's legal powers to tackle violent extremism and incitement to religious and racial hatred. It does not permit somebody to be banned for simply holding disagreeable political views but will apply to those who advocate illegal means to further them.</p> <p>An MI5 report leaked to the Guardian this year on the current state of radicalisation and violent extremism in Britain noted that the influence of extremist clerics had \"moved into the background\" in recent years.</p>",

  "<p>I am of course delighted that the alleged plot to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/uselections2008-barackobama-neo-nazi-plot \">murder Barack Obama</a> and over 100 other African-Americans has been foiled. And yet, deep down, I can't help thinking that at least it shows someone's taking this election seriously. For all the hype and fluff and trivia about retired Weathermen and who can see Russia from her house, there's a vague sense that November 2008 really matters: the vague concept of \"change\" that brought Obama to prominence has become something tangible. For many, it is a sign of hope in dark times; the fact that it provokes a few others into planning acts of violence is further evidence of its potency.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, there are others who care. Well, a bit. Maybe. Confronted with provocative comments by immigration minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/7921699\">Phil Woolas</a>, a representative of the Manchester No Borders group threw a pie at him.</p> <p>Now, I'm all for acts of political street theatre; and pie throwing has an honorable tradition in the annals of counter culture, pricking pomposity and lightening the beige predictability of so much conventional debate. Legendary entarteurs such as <a href=\"http://www.whisperedmedia.org/Godin.html\">No\u00ebl Godin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mcgilltribune.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=efc8727d-44b1-44e7-9a5c-232c82f025f4\">Fran\u00e7ois Gourd</a> have kept the traditions of Situationism and Dada alive with their spontaneous patisserie politics.</p> <p>But pie throwers and their ilk usually aren't partisan; their ire is directed at politicians as a breed. Woolas was notionally pied because of what he said about immigration, but there's no evidence that his opposite number in the Conservative party would do anything different. Entartement is a sigh of impotent exasperation at society itself, as one set of self-important white men in suits replaces another; the least we can do is send them to the dry cleaners.</p> <p>Obama's wannabe killers, by contrast, wanted to take him out because of who and what he was, just as Booth shot Lincoln because he'd humiliated the Confederacy. And any British prime minister lives under permanent threat from the likes of al-Qaida; it happens on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/spooks/index.shtml\">Spooks</a>, so it must be true. </p> <p>The fact remains, though, that only one British PM, the otherwise anonymous <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/history/pms/perceval.html\">Spencer Perceval</a> in 1812, has faced the ultimate backlash; four presidents have eaten lead since then, and several others (notably Ronald Reagan) have come perilously close. Conventional explanations for this tend to focus on American gun culture and Wild West mentality. I suspect it's more about differing responses to the political process; Americans may loathe their elected representatives, but they'll loathe them sincerely and without irony. The British just shrug, and head for the cake shop.</p>",
  "<p>Confirmation that the government is to <a href=\"http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5iCZc-SDAkjwRFtQ9Tqvo9obPg4Ug\">abandon plans</a> for a new bank holiday to celebrate a Britishness day will come as welcome news to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), who have estimated that such a day would <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6965053.stm\">cost UK business</a> up to \u00a36 billion. </p> <p>Of course, this being the CBI, the figures are based on potential lost profits and wages paid \u2013 which is a fairly flimsy basis for such analysis. Orders would not just dry up on the basis of such a day and outstanding work would simply take place on another day, such is the potential slippage of the workplace. Their view simply looks like that of a killjoy outfit who nowadays carry far more weight with government departments than trade unions or individual workers.</p> <p>With recession now being really, almost, nearly, oooh-so-close to being official, Gordon Brown seems to be missing a trick by not giving the UK population an extra bank holiday on which to do his Keynesian bidding and <a href=\"http://www.vivnicholson.co.uk/\">spend, spend, spend</a>. Yes, a bank holiday may mean businesses paying employees for a day not worked, but the days when the nation holidays en masse are also some of the busiest in our seaside resorts, public houses, supermarkets, DIY superstores, shopping malls and high streets.</p> <p>Obviously those employed in the donkey hire, pub and retail sectors will not enjoy the extra day off at the same time as the rest of us, but, with their jobs among those most under threat, the mini consumer boom and the attendant job safety would be most welcome. Holding the day in the approach to summer would see a consumer spending spike even in recession, as a day off and the promise of sun never fails to inspire theme park visits, coastal excursions and, family barbecues, complete with the purchase of 24-packs of strong lager and industrial quantities of sausages.</p> <p>By abandoning this new bank holiday and its Britishness tag, Brown has also missed a trick on another level, in that now is exactly the time when he needs to pull the nation together in a common cause. Much has already been made of various \"buy British\" campaigns, such as the one <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/money/backingbritbiz/article1834137.ece\">being run</a> in The Sun newspaper, but these could easily be consolidated into a Britain-backing spendfest if we were all given an extra day in which to participate. Then there is the added bonus of improved national spirit and a welcome relief from the grind for employees, many of whom are already aping the 1960s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Backing_Britain\">Backing Britain</a> campaign (which was, oddly, <a href=\"http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=450757\">endorsed in song</a> by Bruce Forsyth), by working extra hours for no extra pay.</p> <p>Of course, there will always be those who say that recession-hit Brits will simply <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/22/weather.transport\">stay at home</a> and save their money, but history points to just the opposite. We have so few public holidays in this country that a new one is bound to buck up the mood of the nation and send them out into the gardens, shopping centres and motorway traffic jams.</p> <p>By the way, thanks to those of you who commented on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/16/britishidentity.communities\">my last piece</a> with ideas for how we might celebrate a Britishness day.

  "<p>Fall Out Boy's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/19/news.falloutboy\">last world record attempt</a> may have ended with a collapsing Antarctic ice-shelf, but the American emo-rockers are undeterred. They have set their sights on a new world record, aiming this weekend to complete the most ever radio interviews in a single day.</p> <p>At 3:00 PST on Halloween, songwriters Pete Wentz and Patrick Stump will sit down at Premiere Studios in Los Angeles and begin taking questions. They hope to crisscross the airwaves of the nation, taking interviews from Alaska to Wyoming, telling interviewers all there is to know about Fall Out Boy and their new album, Folie \u00e0 Deux.</p> <p>Folie \u00e0 Deux is a French phrase meaning \"two people's bone-headed scheme\".</p> <p>According to Guinness, the present record for a pair of radio interviewees is 57 radio stations in 24 hours. This record was set in May 2008, although we are not sure by whom. For some reason this momentous achievement did not make the front pages of any newspapers \u2013 or even the database on the <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/search.aspx?txtSearchString=\" radio\" \">Guinness website</a>.</p> <p>It's certainly a clever world record to pursue.

  "<p><strong>October 27 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Immigration</strong><br>Ministers moved to highlight tough credentials on illegal immigration, claiming someone is being stopped by the authorities every eight minutes. Immigration minister Phil Woolas said the government was ejecting people out of the country \"quicker than we have done before\" and he hailed \"improved\" figures for removal of foreign national prisoners.</p> <p>Woolas said: \"The measures that are being put in place to control our border to count people in and count people out using the e-borders system and of course the introduction later this year of ID cards with DNA fingerprints ... will mean we have the strongest and secure borders for many, many a year.\"</p> <p>Tory Patrick Mercer (Newark) said: \"I welcome the shake-up to our border security that you have talked about but I hope you can tell me how many illegal immigrants we have got rid of and how many you think are remaining that need to be got rid of?\" Woolas replied: \"The successes that have been put into place mean that we are now stopping one illegal immigrant every eight minutes in this country.\"</p> <p><strong>Local bus services</strong><br>Councils are to be given the final say on contracts to improve the quality of local bus services, junior transport minister Paul Clark said. The government was also acting to further strengthen employment protection for bus company workers.</p> <p>Clark said the government was amending the local transport bill to enable councils to run bus services as \"operator of last resort\" in very limited circumstances. The bill enables \"quality contracts\" to be set up to improve services on defined routes. Clark added: \"The government has listened carefully to MPs and local authorities.\"</p> <p><strong>Protest climate camp at Kingsnorth power station</strong><br>MPs accused police at a protest climate camp at Kingsnorth power station, Kent of unnecessary aggression towards campaigners. Liberal Democrat Norman Baker (Lewes), demanding an independent inquiry, said: \"I personally witnessed unnecessarily aggressive policing, unprovoked violence against peaceful protesters and an extraordinary number of police on site - and tactics such as confiscating toilet rolls, board games and clown costumes.\"</p> <p>Police minister Vernon Coaker said the Independent Police Complaints Commission was available to look into any complaints. He told Baker: \"I hope you ... have made those comments to Kent police so that they can be investigated. And if you feel that that process is unsatisfactory then you know that can then be taken to the IPCC.\"</p> <p>Former prime minister Tony Blair will not face any further investigation by the Speaker, Michael Martin, into claims he misled MPs over the \"Ecclestone affair\", it emerged.</p> <p>Martin had pledged to look into allegations that Blair personally intervened to secure Formula One's exemption from a tobacco advertising ban hours after meeting the sport's boss, Bernie Ecclestone. In a letter to Tory former minister John Maples (Stratford-on-Avon), the Speaker said Blair's answers about the timing of his decision \"could have been clearer\". But he ruled out any further action.</p> <p><strong>Government groups for Muslim women</strong><br>Government groups focused on Muslim women are \"patronising\", shadow cabinet member Baroness Warsi, a Muslim, warned. She picked out the example of the Muslim Women's Advisory Group, launched to advise the communities and local government department, and said: \"Creation of such groups is actually dividing communities and it is quite patronising because it says to Muslim women you can only engage with us as Muslim women and not as individuals.\"</p> <p>But Lord Patel of Bradford, for the government, replied: \"If it is suggested that by focusing on Muslims or Muslim women we are patronising them or creating divisions that were not previously there I completely disagree.</p> <p><strong>Security of small airports</strong><br>Small airports provide a \"leaky\" entry into the UK, Tory Lord Naseby warned. He said private aircraft and non-scheduled flights taking passengers in and out of the country were not closely monitored by immigration and security officials.</p> <p>Security minister Lord West of Spithead said the situation was \"an area of concern\". But he added: \"To put it into context one has to realise that 99.5% of everybody coming in and out of this country actually goes through the top airports and the top ports and those are monitored 24/7.\"</p> <p><strong>Division bells</strong><br>MPs should not just rely on division bells to alert them to a vote but should check their pagers and BlackBerries, deputy Speaker Sylvia Heal said after the failure of a bell to ring in Portcullis House caused a five-minute delay in a Commons vote. She told MPs: \"Although I know members rely on the division bells, you do have other means of knowing when there is a vote.\"</p>",
  "<p>Christianity has a long tradition of defiance of civil authorities in the cause of justice and human rights. Jesus suffered a judicial penalty in his death: Paul was repeatedly imprisoned for his proclamation of the good news of Jesus, and while Jesus himself could be regarded as the victim of a miscarriage of justice, Paul deliberately and purposefully broke the law for the sake of the Gospel.</p> <p>Over the centuries Christians have believed it their duty to defy tyrannical regimes, which sometimes themselves acted in the name of Christianity. The Reformation and the civil wars of the 17th century demonstrate that, as did Christian opposition to Stalinist Russia or the Third Reich. However, in the last century it became clear to many Christians that democratic governments, too, needed to be challenged by civil disobedience. Martin Luther King's defiance of American race laws is the best known example of this.</p> <p>So what of asylum seekers? Christians, and others, in many parts of the country have sought to challenge elements of the government's <a href=\"http://www.iasuk.org/C2B/document_tree/ViewADocument.asp?ID=411&amp;CatID=53\">asylum laws</a>. They have criticised the refusal to allow asylum seekers to work and so contribute to the economy. They have opposed a tribunal system which often appears to be based on an assumption of guilt and produces unsafe verdicts. They have challenged government assessments of \"safe\" countries to which to return asylum seekers, and they have provided food and shelter for those driven into destitution by our laws.</p> <p>All of these are topics of political debate, both locally and nationally \u2013 not least through contributions by bishops in the House of Lords. For Christians, there are two fundamental truths which colour their response. First, all humanity is made in the image of God and so all human beings are sacred. Second, Jesus came as a human being to share our experiences and is honoured in the poor and deprived.</p> <p>So Christians have a duty to defend and provide for those in need. Political argument is not enough. In a mining community during the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2004/miners_strike/default.stm\">1984-5 strike</a> we debated whether church and charitable funds could be used to provide food for striking miners and their families. We feared we might be sued for misuse of funds. We were clear that this was a risk we were prepared to take in the defence of human rights and human need.</p> <p>So Christians and others are prepared to break the law today where that is necessary to maintain the human rights of those in need. Human rights have been basic to the Christian gospel long before the contemporary acts and conventions. In Leeds we are both challenged and inspired by the case of <a href=\"http://www.networkleeds.com/group/group.aspx?id=\" 40837\" \">Manuel Bravo</a>, who committed suicide in Yarlswood detention centre in order that his son would not be removed to an uncertain and unsafe destination. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/20/immigrationandpublicservices.immigration\">Bravo succeeded</a>, but at the ultimate personal cost. Christians will feel in some circumstances that they should assist those in hiding from the authorities, in order to prevent their removal to places which for them are not safe. Sometimes these will be countries which are safe for others but not, for example, for members of opposition groups in that society.</p> <p>Always there will be an obligation on Christians to provide food and shelter. So all our major cities now have organisations which provide such support for asylum seekers. These are rarely specifically Christian \u2013 Christians have no monopoly of the obligation for human equality and care. In many cases churches, however, are major contributors to such organisations, driven by their own Christian principles. Sometimes this involves provision of care for those the government would remove, and who are terrified of returning to their home countries.</p> <p>Finally, there can be specific occasions when Christians need to defend their fellow Christians, threatened with return to countries where conversion to Christianity in itself brings the threat of persecution. Tribunals are notoriously suspicious of conversion to Christianity, which is astonishing in a country whose law has been based on Christian principles. The right to choose one's religion, and to change it, is crucial to human rights legislation. Where that is defied, Christians will have a duty to defend their fellow Christians, though that may mean breaking the law.</p> <p>Christians are loyal members of the society and culture in which they find themselves. They support a governmental system which provides schools and hospitals and administers justice. Where human rights and freedom of conscience are concerned, however, they will recognise that they owe allegiance to a higher authority, and will put themselves at risk to obey it.</p> <p><em>John Packer is the Bishop of Leeds and Ripon</em></p>",

(JJ)</p> <h2>Hawaii (late 18th or early 19th century) - The War God Ku</h2> <p>The spirit of war is fearsomely captured in this squat, long-haired statue with chunky limbs and a face that radiates angry lines in a huge, grotesque leer. You don't need to be told that this is the martial god in his guise as the Snatcher-of-Land to sense the menace and danger inherent in this carved breadfruit wood monster. (JJ)</p> <h2>John Heartfield - Knut Hamsun's Candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize (1936)</h2> <p>A note on this photomontage stresses that the photographs of Hitler and G\u00f6ring have been used unaltered. Heartfield has found images of the Nazis in revealingly hysterical poses, pressed them luridly close together with a barrage of guns behind them, and exposed the Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun's support for these monsters. (JJ)</p> <h2>Hellenistic (lost original 3rd-2nd century BC; copy 1st century BC) - Laoco\u00f6n</h2> <p>Laoco\u00f6n, a priest of Troy, foretold that taking the wooden horse into the city was a big mistake. A serpent rose from the sea and devoured him and his sons, depicted in this horribly vivid Hellenistic sculpture, a study in agony. (CH)</p> <h2>Hellenistic (c180BC) - Great Altar of Zeus from Pergamum</h2> <p>The base of this great altar, over2m tall, shows the mythical battle between gods and giants: brutal conflict, writhing bodies, faces clenched in agony, gorgeously swirling drapery. (CH)</p> <h2>Hellenistic or Roman (date unknown) - Gilt bronze horses of St Mark's Venice</h2> <p>Though replicas now adorn the fa\u00e7ade of one of the most beautiful basilicas in the world, these proud, strutting, late-antique horses are a joy in themselves and testament to the skilful recycling of ancient art in later eras. (CH)</p> <h2>Barbara Hepworth - Three Forms (1935)</h2> <p>Three imperfect polished white ovals sit on a marble base, their shadows elongating across the surface. Barbara Hepworth's simple arrangement is the finest example of art as pure form. (JL)</p> <h2>Eva Hesse - Addendum (1967)</h2> <p>Some might say this German-born, American-raised sculptor, who died in her 30s, gave minimalism movement and a heart. Here hemispheres are arranged in a row on a wall, distances between them organised mathematically. But each dangles an unruly length of cord, and the hemispheres resemble breasts. (CH)</p> <h2>Susan Hiller - From the Freud Museum (1991-1996)</h2> <p>Originating with an invitation to creatively infiltrate Freud's last home, this is an exercise in analytical make-believe. Rock shards, medicine bottles, old photos and engravings: throwaway oddments are collected in specimen boxes and meticulously yet cryptically catalogued to afford them the significance of psychological clues. The mystery, of course, remains. (RC)</p> <h2>John Hinde - Twilight Over Torquay Harbour, South Devon (c1963)</h2> <p>Best known for his postcard photos of the hoi polloi pretending to have fun at Butlins, Hinde's image of Torquay harbour is an acidic sunset hallucination.

Capturing the moment of a summer downpour, Hiroshige depicts figures sheltering under umbrellas as they cross the Oshashi bridge. A competitive contemporary of Hokusai, Hiroshige found fame with The Fifty-Three Stations of the Tokaido, a series of prints drawn from his travels, and went on to make dozens of atmospheric landscape scenes in his 100 Famous Views of Edo.

(JJ)</p> <h2>David Hockney - A Bigger Splash (1967)</h2> <p>Few paintings exemplify the colour and optimism of the 1960s more than David Hockney's depictions of Californian swimming pools. Sunny, glamorous and exotic, they represented aspirations far removed from the grime of postwar Britain. (JL)</p> <h2>William Hogarth - A Rake's Progress (1734), Marriage A La Mode (1735)</h2> <p>Chippy, angry, undignified, brilliant Hogarth was a one-off, a supremely sharp observer of human foibles, a satirist who married his often dark, cruel observations with an elegant handling of paint and talent for composition. The eight-canvas series A Rake's Progress and the six-canvas Marriage A La Mode are both masterpieces of storytelling, teeming with detail. <br>Rake charts the descent of dandyish, hapless Tom into the lunatic asylum via a life of folly and debauchery. In Marriage, a cynical engagement between a rich merchant's daughter and an impoverished aristocrat ends with syphilis, murder and penury. Pure theatre in two dimensions. (CH)</p> <h2>Katsushika Hokusai - Fuji Seen through the Waves off Kanagawa (c1830), Ejiri in Suruga Province (c1830) (both from Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji), 100 Views of Mount Fuji (c1840)</h2> <p>The most iconic symbol of Japanese art is Katsushika Hokusai's Fuji Seen through the Waves off Kanagawa, better known as The Great Wave. Its graphic simplicity and brilliant use of colour have inspired painters for generations, and the self-taught artist who created it became the epitome of the 'floating world' or ukiyo-e school. The painting was part of a series Hokusai produced of different weather conditions and seasons of Mount Fuji, of which all 46 (10 were added later) views of the volcanic rock are exquisite. A special mention for Ejiri in Suruga Province, in which Hokusai captures a group of figures battling the wind, as their belongings flutter skywards as they start in surprise. So popular was the series that he went on to create the epic 100 Views of Mount Fuji.

Some have said that by limiting herself to words she lacks depth, but what she inventively shows is the wonderful, worrying power of words. (MB)</p> <h2>Winslow Homer - Summer Night (1890)</h2> <p>Boston-born Homer, perhaps the only person in history to move from America to Cullercoats in north Tyneside, travelled extensively in Europe. He is a wonderful storyteller and poet, and this painting of women dancing wildly on rocks in front of the full moon and the wild sea just transports you to a different, marvellous place. You don't want to come back. (MB)</p> <h2>Edward Hopper - Nighthawks (1942)</h2> <p>There's shades of Raymond Chandler here, the same unforgiving fluorescent glare, the same 3am shadow, the same tipped forward trilbies and scarlet clad femme fatale.

Rebecca Horn's is an art of sculptural ballet. (RC)</p> <h2>Peter Hujar - Candy Darling on her Deathbed (1974)</h2> <p>The beautiful, dying transvestite Candy Darling lies in her hospital bedroom, her heavy makeup and peroxide hair no protection against her own mortality.

  "<p>The ruins lie silent and abandoned in the heart of the jungle; blocks of stone surrendered to the vines, which twist and writhe over temples, plazas and pyramids. Weeds and forest creatures have colonised the inner sanctums; mahogany and cedar trees swallow what once were roads, blotting out the sun. This is Tikal, the ancient Mayan city of northern Guatemala. There was a time when tens of thousands of people lived here. The architecture and urban planning - there are epic monuments, boastful inscriptions and even courts for playing ball games - embody boundless human confidence. </p> <p>Today the only voices are of murmuring tourists, interlopers into a domain of spider monkeys and jaguars. \"The imagination reels. There are reliefs, pyramids, temples in the extinguished city. The ... sound of flapping wings trickle into the immense sea of silence,\" wrote Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias, Guatemala's Nobel laureate. </p> <p>Shortly after its apogee, around AD800, the Mayan civilisation, the most advanced in the western hemisphere, withered. Kingdoms fell, monuments were smashed and the great stone cities emptied. Tikal now stands as an eerie embodiment of a society gone wrong, of collapse. How it came to pass is a question that has long fascinated scholars. Titles such as Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization fill faculty bookshelves. It has also provided fodder for literature and films, most recently Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. There is a grim, irresistible appeal to this tale of central American oblivion.</p> <p>Recent events have injected a jarring note into Mayan studies: a sense of anxiety, even foreboding. Serious people are asking a question that at first sounds ridiculous. What if the fate of the Maya is to be our fate? What if climate change and the global financial crisis are harbingers of a system that is destined to warp, buckle and collapse? </p> <p>No one is suggesting that vines will start crawling up the concrete canyons of Wall Street, or that howler monkeys will chase pin-striped bankers through Manhattan. Mayan kings who screwed up were ritually tortured and sacrificed with the aid of stingray spines to pierce the penis; an emphatic application of moral hazard. In our era, the only thing slashed is a bonus. </p> <p>There are, however, striking parallels between the Maya fall and our era's convulsions. \"We think we are different,\" says Jared Diamond, the American evolutionary biologist. \"In fact . . . all of those powerful societies of the past thought that they too were unique, right up to the moment of their collapse.\" The Maya, like us, were at the apex of their power when things began to unravel, he says. As stock markets zigzag into uncharted territory and ice caps continue to melt, it is a view increasingly echoed by scholars and commentators. </p> <p>What, then, is the story of the Maya? And what lessons does it hold for us? According to Diamond's thesis, this: the ancients built a very clever and advanced society but were undone by their own success. Populations grew and stretched natural resources to breaking point. Political elites failed to resolve the escalating economic problems and the system collapsed. There was no need for an external cataclysm or a plague. What did for the Maya was a slow-boiling environmental-driven crisis that its leaders failed to recognise and resolve until too late. </p> <p>\"Because peak population, wealth, resource consumption, and waste production are accompanied by peak environmental impact - approaching the limit at which impact outstrips resources - we can now understand why declines of societies tend to follow swiftly on their peaks,\" wrote Diamond in a 2003 article, The Last Americans: Environmental Collapse and the End of Civilization. The idea is expanded in his book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The link between environmental, economic and political stress is clear, says Diamond. \"When people are desperate and undernourished, they blame their government, which they see as responsible for failing to solve their problems.\"</p> <p>A visit to the jungle ruins in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, stretching from southern Mexico down to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Belize, is a humbling experience. There is sticky, sapping heat and squadrons of biting, stinging mosquitoes. The Maya were not a homogenous empire like the Inca or Aztecs but a series of squabbling kingdoms. The first settlements have been dated back to 1800BC but what is known as the \"classic\" period started much later, around AD250. The final period - zenith and collapse between AD750 and AD900 - is known as the \"terminal classic\".</p> <p>Tikal, deep in the forest of Pet\u00e9n in northern Guatemala, was one of the Mayan capitals, a sprawling complex of limestone structures that was home to up to 100,000 people. Kings doubled up as head priests and political leaders. There were acropolises with hieroglyphs and pyramids with flat roofs from which astronomers and mathematicians mapped the planets and calculated calendars.</p> <p>The Maya accomplished all this without pack animals - no cows, mules or horses to heave and push, just human muscle - and with limited water, which forced reliance on rainfall. By AD750 there were several million in the region, most of them farmers. Monuments and palaces became ever grander as kings and nobles competed for glory. And then everything went pear-shaped. Archaeological records show monument building abruptly stopped, as did the boastful inscriptions. There is evidence that palaces may have been burned. </p> <p>Most dramatically, the population vanished. Over a few generations numbers withered from millions to tens of thousands, maybe even just thousands. Most abandoned the cities and migrated north. The birth rates of those who stayed tumbled. (Mathematically, Russia's population decline is on a similar trajectory). By the time Spaniards clanked into southern Yucat\u00e1n in the 1500s there was hardly anyone left. Today, lush vegetation has reclaimed Tikal, turning everything mossy and green, but the temples, the tallest pre-Columbine structures, rise high over the canopy. George Lucas used Tikal as the site for the rebel base in the first Star Wars film.</p> <p>To explain the mysterious collapse some scholars posit an invasion, or disease, or shifting trade routes, or a drought. There is wide agreement, however, that a leading cause was environmental pressure. \"The carrying capacity of the ecosystem was pushed to its limits,\" says Marcello Canuto, an anthropology professor at Yale. Lakes became silted and soils exhausted. Tilling and man-made reservoirs provided more food and water but population growth outstripped technological innovation. </p> <p>Complex and organised it may have been but Mayan society resembled a frog who stays in slowly boiling water, says Canuto. \"Things were brewing within the system that were not picked up until too late.\" When the political elites did react they made things worse by offering greater sacrifices to the gods and plundering neighbours. \"The kingdoms were interdependent and there was a ripple effect. They did not respond correctly to a crisis which, in hindsight, was as clear as day.\" </p> <p>The environmental trouble built up over centuries and was partly concealed by short-term fluctuations in rainfall patterns and harvest yields. But when the tipping point came, events moved quickly. \"Their success was built on very thin ice. Kings were supposed to keep order and avoid chaos through rituals and sacrifice,\" says David Webster, author of The Fall of the Ancient Maya. \"When manifestly they couldn't do it people lost confidence and the whole system of kingship fell apart.\"</p> <p>Which brings us to modern parallels. Webster, watching the season's first snowflakes through the window of his office at Pennsylvania State University, has been waiting for the question. Pinned to his wall is an old clipping about the fall of Enron Corporation in 2001. \"That was the first tremor,\" he muses. \"You know, human beings are always surprised when things collapse just when they seem most successful. We look around and we think we're fat, we're clever, we're comfortable and we don't think we're on the edge of something nasty. Hubris? No: ignorance.\"</p> <p>Some anthropologists hesitate to make direct links between ancient and modern societies, deeming it out of academic bounds. Not Webster. \"In common with the Maya, we're not very rational in how we think about how the world works. They had their rituals and sacrifices. Magic, in other words. And we also believe in magic: that money and innovation can get us out of the inherent limits of our system, that the old rules don't apply to us.\" He snorts.</p> <p>This is a modish view these days but it was considered cranky luddism back during the 1980s stockmarket boom and the 1990s dotcom bubble. That was when masters of the universe bestrode Wall Street and Francis Fukuyama caught the triumphalist liberal economic zeitgeist with his book The End of History and the Last Man. That era, to borrow from Star Wars, feels a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Now Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are history and governments are taking over banks and propping up markets. </p> <p>If traders and their mumbo jumbo about securitisation and derivatives resemble Mayan priests chanting in their temples then Bush and Gordon Brown are the hapless kings who egged them on rather than query the \"magic\". As chancellor, Brown blessed the conjuring. \"In budget after budget I want us to do even more to encourage the risk-takers,\" he said in 2004. Now the frailty is revealed and instead of Gordon Gekko's \"greed is good\" we are hearing Shelley's Ozymandias: \"Nothing beside remains. Round the decay/ Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare/ The lone and level sands stretch far away.\" </p> <p>Canuto sees an unhappy precedent. The Mayan kings who allowed their era's crisis to spin out of control were unfit to remedy it, not least because they were invested in the broken system. \"The ones who caused the crisis are the ones you don't want trying to resolve it.\" Bush, by coincidence of timing, is on his way out but Britain's prime minister and other G8 leaders are hanging on.</p> <p>Several commentators have argued that the financial crisis is but a squall compared with the ecological hurricane they say is coming. A European study estimates deforestation alone is causing a loss of natural capital worth between $2 trillion and $5tn annually. \"The two crises have the same cause,\" wrote George Monbiot in the Guardian earlier this month. \"In both cases, those who exploit the resource have demanded impossible rates of return and invoked debts that can never be repaid. In both cases we denied the likely consequences.\" With ecology the stock from which all wealth grows, the financial and environmental crises feed each other, says Monbiot.</p> <p>If so, the Maya offer an ominous glimpse of what may lie in store. \"Their population growth was like driving a car faster and faster until the engine blew up,\" says Webster, the anthropologist. \"Look at us. I'm 65. When I was born there were two billion people in the world, now we're approaching seven billion. That's extraordinary.\" Eventually pressure on scarce resources will overwhelm technology - and do for us as it did for the Maya. \"The western conceit is that we can have it all - and call it progress,\" says Webster. His voice drops. \"I'm glad I'm not 30 years old. I don't want to see what's coming in the next 40 to 50 years.\"</p> <p>Armageddon, like hemlines, is prone to changes in fashion. It has been on a roll with films such as 28 Days Later, I Am Legend and Blindness, which posit a world grimmer than anything Hobbes envisaged. Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic novel, The Road, was hailed as an environmental fable. \"By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp,\" he writes, before introducing baby-skewering cannibals. That too is being made into a film. Webster does not think things will get that bad. \"Not like Mad Max,\" he says, managing to sound almost cheery. \"But definitely unpleasant.\" </p> <p>The gloom may be misplaced. Reports of capitalism's death have been exaggerated before and it has stubbornly survived Karl Marx, the Great Depression, world wars and oil shocks. And in contrast to the Maya, it is possible our technology will prevail over population and environmental pressures. Malthusian doomsayers have consistently underestimated the capacity of better irrigation, pesticides, new strains of crops and other technologies to boost food yields. The rate of population growth is slowing and human numbers are expected to peak at around 9.2 billion by 2050 before declining. That Asians are moving more and more to western-type diets and consumer baubles will strain resources, acknowledges the Economist. But don't worry: \"There is no limit to human ingenuity.\"</p> <p>If the gloomy environmental prognosis is correct, and global warming is set to wreak major havoc, what are the chances we will respond better than the Maya? Electing Bush instead of Al Gore suggests limited wisdom in picking kings, and emasculating the Kyoto treaty was perhaps as sensible as burning corn harvests to appease the gods. When Republicans chant, \"Drill, baby, drill!\" it is not much of a stretch to picture them, barefoot and in traditional huipil shirts, rooting for another sacrifice.</p> <p>Nevertheless there are promising omens. Governments are beginning to assign monetary values to natural \"assets\" such as forests, a conceptual leap that could reinvent economics. The EU has set up a carbon-trading market to get industry to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The UN is pushing for a new climate treaty in which governments will pay tropical countries billions of dollars annually to leave their forests untouched. Ecuador has already requested $350m a year in exchange for leaving 1bn barrels of oil beneath its Amazon floor. \"I believe the 21st century will be dominated by the concept of natural capital, just as the 20th was dominated by financial capital,\" says Achim Steiner, head of the UN environment programme.</p> <p>Even so, would that be enough? Civilisations rise - and collapse - for many different reasons. If there is a simple lesson to be drawn from central America's abandoned ruins it is to protect the environment and control population growth, says Michael Coe, author of the seminal 1966 text, The Maya. \"No civilisation lasts for ever. Most go for between 200 and 600 years.\" The Maya, Romans and Angkor of Cambodia lasted 600. </p> <p>And us? \"Western civilisation began with the Renaissance, so we're hitting 600 years,\" says Coe. \"The difference is we have a choice whether to let things get worse or fix them. That's what science is about. But it takes will on the part of those who govern and those who are being governed.\" Coe, one of the world's leading experts on civilisation collapse, pauses. \"To tell you the truth, I don't know if we have that.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Andrew \"Drax\" Manley, who has died of cirrhosis aged 44, chatted, his thoughts would range over music, football (Newcastle United), cricket, politics, history or his interest in the wildlife engraver Thomas Bewick. But, above all, it was Africa that dominated his thoughts, as it did his career.</p> <p>After the Royal grammar school, Newcastle upon Tyne, and a history degree at University College London (1983-86), the postgraduate research theme that captured Andrew's interest was the role of Islam in francophone west Africa. Unable to survive on a student grant at the School of Oriental and African Studies, he moved in the late 1980s to the Sahel, living in an ordinary Malian home in S\u00e9gou, beside the Niger river. In 1991 he experienced history in the raw as Mali's dictatorship was toppled by popular protest.</p> <p>Back in London, as a journalist at the Economist Intelligence Unit (1994-97), Andrew brought a rare understanding of how sub-Saharan societies are shaped by their history, religions and culture, and how everyday life is lived and felt. Later, he contributed to books, magazines, newsletters and the BBC - and, whenever possible, just got on a plane to Bamako, Dakar or Abidjan. </p> <p>In 1999 he had to leave Chad hurriedly after a brush with the security services; that same year, he was an EU observer for the Nigerian presidential elections; in 2000 he travelled as adviser with County Durham theatre company Cap-a-Pie to an international theatre festival in Burkina Faso. In recent years his expert witness reports were frequently critical in ensuring that African asylum seekers to the UK got a fair hearing on appeal. </p> <p>Music was a passion. In the late 1980s, Andrew helped establish a reggae club in Newcastle, and in London he worked at the legendary Ray's Jazz Shop. But his love of African music stood out and his pilgrimages to west Africa led to meetings with many heroes: Ali Farka Tour\u00e9, Toumani Diabat\u00e9, Orch\u00e8stre Baobab. In recent years, he wrote pungent reviews for the world music journal Songlines.</p> <p>He was fascinated by artisanal textile production and wore a favourite African shirt to sit for Jason Line's entry for the 1994 BP Portrait Award - which hung in the award exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.</p> <p>As a friend, Andrew was both maddeningly unreliable and fiercely loyal.

Of those, 79 were excluded for unacceptable behaviour.</p> <p>The most high-profile individuals to face exclusion orders include Omar Bakri Mohammed who was banned in the wake of the July 7 terror attacks in London and the Egypt-born cleric, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, banned by the Home Office this year after being described as a \"dangerous and divisive\" preacher of hate by David Cameron, the Tory leader.</p> <p>The Home Office anticipates that the new rules will see a larger number of people barred from Britain.</p> <p>The ban rests on the government's legal powers to tackle violent extremism and incitement to religious and racial hatred. It does not permit somebody to be banned for simply holding disagreeable political views but will apply to those who advocate illegal means to further them.</p> <p>Smith said yesterday the strengthened rules would give the Home Office the power to name individuals stopped from entering Britain. At present they are banned from naming those involved in individual cases who remain anonymous unless they choose to fight the ban and name themselves. This would also enable their names to be shared with other countries and placed on British port \"watchlists\" to ensure that any future visa application did not slip through the net.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said unless an individual could persuade the authorities that they were no longer involved in preaching hate, they would face a permanent ban.</p> <p>He said an individual who claimed to show that they had repudiated previous extremist views or actions would have to publicly retract them.</p> <p>\"Coming to Britain is a privilege and I don't want to extend that privilege to individuals who abuse our standards and values to undermine our way of life,\" Smith said yesterday.</p> <p>A MI5 report leaked to the Guardian this year on the current state of radicalisation and violent extremism in Britain noted that the influence of extremist clerics had \"moved into the background\" in recent years.</p> <h2>Not wanted?</h2> <p>In February, Muslim cleric <strong>Yusuf al-Qaradawi</strong> was refused a visa to enter the UK after comments surfaced in which he defended suicide attacks on Israelis. Qaradawi had been welcomed to London in 2004 by former London mayor Ken Livingstone. The ban provoked a furious response from the Muslim Council of Britain. </p> <p>A month later a member of Israel's rightwing Likud party was refused entry to the UK on the grounds his presence could provoke hatred, violence or terrorism. <strong>Moshe Feiglin</strong> had written strident articles in the Israeli press, including a piece disparaging Islam.</p> <p><strong>Omar Bakri Mohammed </strong>was banned from re-entering the UK from Lebanon in 2005 after the home secretary decided his presence was \"not conducive to the public good\". Mohammed, who had been granted political asylum, praised the 9/11 hijackers while head of the radical al-Muhajiroun group. </p> <p>A 15-year ban on the Nation of Islam leader, <strong>Louis Farrakhan,</strong> was lifted in 2001 by the high court. Dubbed a \"black racist\" by opponents for his inflammatory speeches criticising Jews and whites, Farrakhan had been banned since 1986. Successive home secretaries have argued his oratory could provoke public disorder.</p> <p>Although he has not been subject to a ban<strong>, Ibrahim Moussawi</strong>, the head of Hizbullah's propaganda wing, may fall within the scope of the new guidelines. In February the Conservatives urged Jacqui Smith to refuse him entry for making antisemitic comments via Hizbullah's newspaper, which he edits.<br><strong>Aidan Jones</strong></p>",
  "<p>The thickness of sea ice in the Arctic dramatically declined last winter for the first time since records began in the early 1990s. The research by British scientists shows a significant loss in the thickness of the northern ice cap after the record loss of ice in the summer of 2007, although the weather was not abnormally warm.</p> <p>The findings, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, raise the possibility that the loss of the Arctic sea ice could accelerate, because as the ice recedes the water temperature rises. This summer the sea ice recorded its second-lowest extent after the record low of 2007, again despite relatively cool air temperatures.</p> <p>However, Katharine Giles of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at University College London, who led the study, said it was too soon to say whether the downward trend would continue and lead to summer sea ice disappearing even faster than forecast. \"It's dangerous to extrapolate out because colder weather would mean the ice could recover again,\" said Giles. \"This data will help climate modellers to validate their models and make them more accurate.\"</p> <p>The study, part-funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the European Union, found the thickness of sea ice in the Arctic was almost unchanged in the five winters from 2002-6, but then declined 10%, or 26cm, last winter. In parts of the western Arctic, where the greatest loss was recorded the previous summer, the loss was nearly double the average. </p> <p>But Vicky Pope, the Met Office's leading adviser to the government on climate change, warned: \"There's clearly a decline over the last 30 years and we can detect a human signal in that, but the change in the last couple of years could be due to natural fluctuations in the weather.\"</p> <p>Other causes of sea ice changes could include ocean currents and wind piling up ice, making it important to measure both thickness and extent to calculate total volume, said Giles.</p>",
  "<p>Democratic leaders are raising their hopes of an election-year sweep - winning the White House and achieving solid majorities in both houses of Congress to dominate Washington on a scale unseen in 40 years. With Barack Obama ahead in the polls and the Democrats likely to expand their majority in the House of Representatives, party leaders are focused on consolidating their control of the Senate.</p> <p>Democratic prospects brightened further yesterday after Ted Stevens, a Republican senator from Alaska, was convicted on corruption charges. Stevens, 84, and the longest serving Republican in the Senate, was fighting off a challenge from his Democratic challenger, Mark Begich, even before he was found guilty of lying about free home renovations received from a wealthy oil contractor.</p> <p>With Stevens's now facing a five-year jail term, it looks increasingly likely that Democrats will reach the magical number of 60 seats in the Senate. That would give them what is called a filibuster-proof majority, making it impossible for Republicans to cut off debate or limit legislation.</p> <p>If Obama wins the White House, that would bring a consolidation of Democratic power in Washington unseen since the 1960s. \"This is a tectonic race,\" Charles Schumer, the New York senator who is overseeing the Democrats' Senate election campaign, told reporters last week. \"This will change things, not just for an election cycle, but a generation.\"</p> <p>A wave of anti-Republican sentiment and excitement over Obama's candidacy that has brought more Democrats to the polls in early voting, has seen the party predicting far bigger gains than those expected a few weeks ago. John McCain's faltering campaign has also hurt Republican candidates in battleground states.</p> <p>Both parties are using the prospect of a filibuster-proof Senate in their campaigns. The Democrats are pushing for 60 as a goal that would allow Obama, if he is elected, to push through sweeping changes on energy, healthcare and foreign policy. The Republicans are campaigning on the dangers of unchecked Democratic rule. Their television ads now routinely link Obama to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, and Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, warning of a dangerous liberal triumvirate.</p> <p>\"Liberals are bent on handing Barack Obama a filibuster-proof Senate majority to rubber-stamp his radical agenda,\" warned Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, in a fundraising email.</p> <p>The Democrats won a 51-49 majority in the Senate in the 2006 elections. But that did not translate into effective power under Senate rules that allow the minority party to extend debate, preventing legislation from being put to a vote.</p> <p>The Republicans have launched nearly 100 filibusters in the past two years, reducing the Senate to a state of paralysis. Senate Democrats were not even able to win enough votes to withdraw US forces from Iraq, even though several similar bills easily passed through the House of Representatives. That could now change, according to Reid, the Senate majority leader. In a recent email to supporters, he wrote: \"Everything Democrats believe in and fight for is in reach ... We stand at the brink of electing Barack Obama and giving him a filibuster-proof majority.\"</p> <p>But solid majorities in Congress are no guarantee a president would win cooperation from his own party, as Jimmy Carter found. The Democrats won 61 seats in the Senate when Carter was elected in 1976, but he rapidly fell out with his party.</p> <p>Obama, if elected, could also run into resistance from a number of the new crop of Democrats, especially those who are currently competing in southern states. A number of the first-time Democratic contenders lean to the right, while some of the Republicans now fighting for their political survival are moderates.</p> <p>\"You are going to have some defections on the Democratic side, because these are some conservative Democrats,\" said Rhodes Cook, who runs a respected political newsletter. \"Whoever is elected will be hemmed in by the economy a great deal, so that might also be the point that overrides the size of the majority.\"</p> <p>Out of the 35 seats up for election, the Republicans are defending 23 and the Democrats 12. Democrats are confident of winning all 12. Republicans face tough contests across the map, with Democrats even, or ahead, in about a dozen seats.</p> <p>By last week, Republican congressional candidates were close to open revolt against McCain. John Ensign, the Nevada Republican who is heading the party's Senate election campaign, was describing McCain as a drag on his fellow candidates. \"Our candidates are running ahead of John McCain in almost every place that I mentioned across the country,\" he told reporters.</p> <p>The challenges to the Republicans cut across geography as well as ideology. Seats held by retiring senators in Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado are now virtually assured of going Democrat.</p> <p>Party elders even in conservative states are facing a tough time. In North Carolina, Elizabeth Dole, who served in two Republican administrations and ran for the White House herself in 2000, is having to spend her own money to fend off a Democratic challenger.</p> <p>In Mississippi and Georgia, a high turnout of African-American voters for Obama in early voting appears to have breathed new life into Democratic Senate challenges once seen as long shots.</p>"
