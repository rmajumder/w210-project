  "<p>It is one of the more puzzling figures amid the financial firestorm gripping markets. </p> <p>Britain's high streets are reporting that shoppers are defying the credit crunch, with bumper sales of clothes and footwear pushing up sales by 1.2% in August. Maybe the economy will be saved not by Mervyn King but by Dorothy Perkins.</p> <p>Next month sees the opening of a vast new temple to shopping, the \u00a31.7bn Westfield centre in White City, London. It is virtually 100% let, its double-height units snapped up by the likes of Prada, Gucci and de Beers. Meanwhile, as HBOS shares were crashing, which company was that day's biggest riser? Debenhams. </p> <p>Britain, it seems, is still hooked on spending. Every week we fork out more than \u00a35bn in the shops. Last month it was shoe shops that were enjoying a roaring trade, as parents splashed out on back-to-school footwear.</p> <p>This was not supposed to happen. The economy is teetering on the brink of recession, and debt-burdened consumers are meant to be reining in spending, trading down to cheaper brands and putting plans for big-ticket purchases on ice.</p> <p>Some economists simply do not believe the Office for National Statistics' August figures, which revealed the surprise spending jump. The statistics have been unusually volatile; May showed a huge surge in spending, followed in June by a sharp reversal.</p> <p>Others say that the high street, like unemployment, is a \"lagging indicator\". When David Blanchflower of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee warned that we could see two million out of work by Christmas, he was seen as excessively pessimistic. But that was before Lehman Brothers, XL Airways and HBOS. Now it seems likely that widescale job losses will halt even the most enthusiastic shoppers.</p>",
  "<p><strong>World</strong><br><strong>Dark Burmese days </strong><br>It is a year since a Burmese soldier shot Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai in the heart while he was covering Burma's saffron revolution for the Japanese agency APF News. Nagai's dying moments, spent lying on his back attempting to film his killer, who stood over him taking aim, were captured by another foreign journalist. Reuters photographer Adrees Latif was crouching on a bridge overhead. His image, which subsequently won a Pulitzer Prize, provoked a worldwide furore, exposing the junta's defence - that Nagai's death was caused by a stray bullet - as worthless.</p> <p>The killing of a foreign journalist was highly unusual in a country where reporters who slipped quietly into the country on tourist visas were rarely apprehended. I spent two weeks there earlier this year without any interference. Andrew Marshall, who covered the saffron revolution for Time, says: \"The main difficulty in Burma is reporting the story without endangering your interviewees or the people who help you meet them.\" </p> <p>For Burmese journalists, the situation is a little different. \"Getting caught can mean torture and imprisonment. It can even be a death sentence. They are the ones who run all the risks,\" says Nic Dunlop, a photographer who worked in Burma for more than a decade.</p> <p>Days after the September demonstrations were violently suppressed, after the foreign journalists had flown home, the junta rounded up local reporters and photojournalists. According to Reporters without Borders, 15 journalists were arrested and accused of sending information abroad at this time. The hunt for photojournalists was so intense that several stopped working, threw away their cameras and went into exile.</p> <p>Among those currently detained are photographer U Thaung Sein, in prison for more than two years for photographing Burma's new capital, Naypidaw; blogger and comedian U Zargana, arrested in June for talking to the BBC about the devastation caused by cyclone Nargis; and journalist U Win Tin, who has served 19 years of a 20-year sentence for spreading propaganda during demonstrations in the 1980s.</p> <p>In addition, in the last week, three Burmese news agencies in exile - the Irrawaddy, the Democratic Voice of Burma and The New Era Journal, whose websites locals rely on for uncensored news - have been victims of cyberspace attacks. Each has been bombarded by requests for information designed to overwhelm servers and render sites incapable of responding to regular traffic. Fearful of further unrest during the anniversary of the saffron revolution, the junta appears to be doing its utmost to continue silencing Burmese media.<br><strong>Amy Gold </strong></p> <p><strong>Publishing</strong><br><strong>Writer blocked</strong><br>In the weeks after 9/11, Anthony McIntyre wore a Fire Department of New York baseball hat in solidarity with citizens of the Big Apple who lost their lives in the Twin Towers. His wife is American and his children have American passports. He has dined with the American consul general to Northern Ireland and has been a guest at their 4th of July Independence Day parties.</p> <p>But, according to the US state department, this ex-IRA prisoner turned author remains persona non grata - an unforgiven convicted \"terrorist\" who shouldn't be allowed to set foot on American soil. </p> <p>The ban is preventing McIntyre from promoting his newly published book across the US. \"I would like to go but I have had that many problems getting in before so I wasn't going to waste any more time applying for a visa,\" he says.</p> <p>The book, Good Friday - the Death of Irish Republicanism, is a collection of articles from the online republican dissident e-zine that McIntyre runs with his wife Carrie Towmey. It deals with what he sees as a betrayal of republicanism by the Sinn Fein leadership. Much of the criticism of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness is lacerating. This, McIntyre believes, is why he cannot get into the US, while Adams and McGuinness (both former IRA prisoners like him) are feted on the other side of the Atlantic as statesmen.</p> <p>\"Past convictions are not a reason for excluding people, otherwise Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness would never have got into America,\" he says.</p> <p>A member of the National Union of Journalists, McIntyre has written on republicanism for, among others, the Observer, the Sunday Tribune in Dublin and the LA Times. \"I do see the ban as double standards,\" he says. \"It's there to load the debate in a certain way regarding Ireland. The American public are not informed about all the issues in Ireland connected to the peace process. It's also very strange because I can write an opinion piece in the comment pages of the LA Times, yet I can't go and explain this in person to American people in their own country.\"<br><strong>Henry McDonald</strong></p> <p><strong>Online</strong><br><strong>Twitter takes flight</strong><br>Twitter made global headlines when James Buck, a graduate journalist, was arrested in Egypt for taking photographs of an anti-government protest earlier this year. On his way to the police station, Buck used his mobile to send the message \"arrested\" to 48 followers on Twitter, which ignited a worldwide campaign to get him released.</p> <p>From that moment, the PR world woke up to the idea that microblogging (Twitter offers a text-based posting system of up to 140 characters in length) could wield a powerful global influence. Most recently, Twitter has been used by Barack Obama to show real-time updates of his progress across America. </p> <p>The Sarah Palin Hockey Mom cult has found its voice through mundane tweets and has been so successful that a large number of satirical tweets have risen around it like cuckoos - the FakeSarahPalin twitter now has more followers than the official Palin site. Palin's PR people may have used it initially to try to expand her personality, but the satirists have the upper hand, because they understand the medium more acutely.</p> <p>Celebrities and their minders are following the trend, including John Cleese and Henry Rollins, intravenously dripping fan bases with soundbites and mindless minutiae, and sidestepping the media hordes. The beauty of Twitter is that it can be linked to a mobile phone, meaning that fans of the Twittering stars can get the information the instant it is disgorged. It's a mode of control, but the PR luvvies need to be smarter.</p> <p>Throughout PR's history, the best publicists have embraced the latest technologies, be it wire service or mobile phone, and used them to enhance a client's profile. The trouble is that the more one sees of the star's life, the less effulgent said celebrity becomes - just look at Britney Spears or Amy Winehouse.</p> <p>So PRs behind the celebrity tweets need to take care, otherwise Twitter could end up making twits of those who tweet because they become totally over-exposed or subsumed in imitators. One just has to look at the early craze on Twitter for people pretending to be Darth Vader or Boba Fett, which started out as charming and funny and swiftly became deeply tedious.</p> <p>If celebrities and their minders over-indulge in Twitter, only the most restrained and interesting characters will survive. Survival of the Twittest, perhaps?<br><strong>Mark Borkowski</strong></p>",
  "<p>The idea of a Conservative MP in Sunderland has been an outlandish notion for most of the past 40 years. It is the most solid of Labour cities in a region that has been loyal at every parliamentary election: in the whole of the north-east, there is only one Conservative MP, in the picturesque rural constituency of Hexham. Surely Sunderland, of all places, will hold out against the appeal of David Cameron's Tories?</p> <p>The only way to find out was to go and find out how the speculation on the future of Gordon Brown's government and the country's financial system reverberates there. In the autumn sunshine, there is plenty of evidence of how loyal the Labour government has been to Sunderland. Ten years of public investment have brought new schools, health centres, children's centres, business parks and housing developments in every part of the city. Plenty more is in the pipeline, with a school due to be rebuilt every year over the next 14 years and huge sums announced recently by Hazel Blears for more regeneration.</p> <p>But patience, loyalty and gratitude are virtues that seem to carry little political weight, and Sunderland Central - the boundaries have been redrawn to create a new seat - could prove to be a spectacular Tory gain at the next election. Likely to be the first seat to declare on election night (it's a point of local pride), the seat could ring the death knell for Labour. A Tory win would signal the sort of dramatic Tory revival projected by polls such as that in the Observer yesterday: if the Tories can win in Sunderland, they can win almost anywhere. The Electoral Calculus website already puts the seat as a Tory gain, one of the tightest marginals in the country. So how on earth does a place like Sunderland get tempted by Toryism, and what shortcomings does it reveal in Labour? </p> <p>The first surprise is that history carries less weight than one might imagine. The Ryhope ward in Sunderland is a former pit village but it went Conservative on a very tight margin last May in the local elections, to everyone's astonishment. Its councillor, Christopher Fairs, was 19 when the Tories lost in 1997, and he argues that the history of pit closures and the devastation under Thatcher has become a distant memory to enough younger voters. Even those old enough to remember high levels of unemployment don't always regard it as a reason to determine their vote; as one former Labour voter puts it, there have been plenty of job losses under Labour as well. The decline of Sunderland's manufacturing base is no longer a crime that can be laid solely at the Conservatives' door. Labour's own mantras about the pace of global change have succeeded in exonerating Thatcherism.</p> <p>When Labour conjures up the past as a method of attack in Sunderland on the Tories, it does so at its peril. Harking back to the past doesn't generate confidence that it is a party with ideas about the future. One can understand why Labour is tempted to do so - it was a very successful Tory scare tactic against Labour in 1987 and 1992 - but it's not going to work the other way round. And if the history is not of much interest, it follows that discussions about whether Cameron has or has not changed the Conservative party are irrelevant. The Tory voter in Sunderland who acknowledges that the minimum wage has been a success sees it as no reason to vote for Labour, given that the Tories have come round to the idea. It's not fair - but then politics doesn't work on fairness.</p> <p>The second surprise is how little credit Labour gets for the massive state investment in a place like Sunderland. Chris Mullin, the much-respected Labour MP whose constituency is now mostly covered by the new seat, is retiring. He admits to being more than a little baffled by what he calls a \"disconnect\". He was canvassing on an estate that had been transformed by a big regeneration scheme. At the doorstep of a brand new house, a woman told him: \"I'm not voting, you've done nothing for us.\" Mullin was left speechless as she slammed the door. He defends the huge sums as essential to begin to repair the social damage of a \"lost generation\" who grew up unemployed, and he admits it's a long-term project that needs probably a generation to succeed.</p> <p>But the Tories can make an appeal to those sections of the working class who don't see this as a matter of patience and see Labour as having been far too generous to the undeserving. They pride themselves on their hard work and deeply resent their taxes funding a benefit system which they argue is being used as a lifestyle choice rather than a reciprocal commitment to a shared safety net. A former Sunderland Labour voter who plans to vote Tory for the first time talks of seeing the same people on benefit in the betting shop for over a decade: how come they have disposable income for a flutter? The same sentiment feeds into the deeply held anxiety over immigration; \"foreigners\" coming to live off \"our\" taxes. This is expressed as often by Labour voters as Tories, despite the fact that Sunderland's immigrant population is small. </p> <p>Meanwhile, there's a long litany of complaints about Labour's record, from the botched abolition of the 10p tax rate (which affects an area like Sunderland with a below-average per capita income particularly badly) to the perceived squandering of money on schemes such as teaching single parents to cook. Sunderland's model of inner-city regeneration - fancy apartments, marina and coffee shops - looks fragile in the current economic climate, and critics say it never had much to offer anyway to those estates round the city where 40% of children are born to single parents and rates of incapacity benefit remain stubbornly high.</p> <p>The appeal of Toryism to working-class voters has often baffled people on the left - they don't see it coming until it's too late, as in 1979. A comparable shift seems to be under way now, and the only question is how deep will be the inroads into Labour heartlands. It takes only a small number of Tory votes and a lot of disillusioned Labour voters who don't bother to turn out to make a seat like Sunderland Central Tory.</p> <p>Gordon Brown's pollster, Deborah Mattinson, seems right that people are not entirely persuaded by Cameron, but that should be no comfort. They don't need to be. This political shift is not about the appeal of an individual leader but about a set of sentiments of which Labour has failed to give an adequate account: individual self-reliance, responsibility, family values and community. It may sound like apple pie, and Labour wouldn't disagree with much of it. Nor does it stack up into a coherent credible set of policies, but on the doorstep that's not how voters judge politicians - they're not policy wonks. Successful politics is ensuring that the voter hears, through the clutter of modern media, a set of symbolic messages. Cameron, for instance, may never implement tax breaks for marriage, but suggesting them has enabled him to position himself as a politician who backs the family. That's how you get the oddest of political outcomes - a Sunderland Tory who feels this Eton-educated southerner is speaking his language.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A series of discussions from Comment is Free and Soundings journal starts with Is the future Conservative? at Kings Place, London, on October 6.

  "<p>If he keeps going at this rate, the referee Mike McCurry will have a more prominent public profile than the players he is paid to preside over. This was billed as McCurry's return to the spotlight - he had not taken a match involving either half of the Old Firm since an error-strewn performance when Rangers faced Dundee United in May.</p> <p>In between times the official had been subjected to tabloid stories regarding his private life, the latest of which arrived yesterday morning as footage of him singing along to an alternative version of Simply The Best - a song favoured by Rangers supporters - at a Baptist Church meeting entered the public domain.</p> <p>McCurry marked his return by awarding three penalties - two of which were for the visitors - and issuing one red card as Celtic's fans made it clear they have a low opinion of him. \"We know you're a hun,\" chanted green-clad fans throughout the match. In fairness, all but two of McCurry's calls were straightforward.</p> <p>Shunsuke Nakamura appeared to throw himself to the ground under little pressure from Craig Bryson for Celtic's second penalty. \"The grin on Nakamura's face as he got up said it all,\" said Alan Combe, the Kilmarnock goalkeeper. The hosts also had a legitimate sense that Danny Invincibile was tripped when conceding possession in the lead up to Celtic's first goal.</p> <p>These incidents, though, could not disguise the fact that this was a comfortable Celtic victory. Kilmarnock started sluggishly and should have been behind within 20 minutes but Shaun Maloney missed a penalty after being fouled by Garry Hay. It was a temporary reprieve and after 26 minutes Maloney curled home the first goal after the home defence failed to clear their lines. Georgios Samaras should have increased his team's lead before half-time but fired wide when clean through. The Greek striker was more ruthless, 11 minutes after the interval, cutting in from the right flank and angling a low shot underneath Combe.</p> <p>Kilmarnock enjoyed their best spell thereafter but were lacking in attacking spark. Nakamura showed little compassion, tumbling in front of Bryson and leaving Samaras to put matters out of sight from the spot. The controversy was far from over. Gary Caldwell punched a net-bound Simon Ford effort off his goal line and was dismissed. Mehdi Taouil scored the resultant Kilmarnock penalty.</p> <p>Kilmarnock announced that their manager, Jim Jefferies, the longest serving manager in the SPL, yesterday signed an extension to his contract until 2012.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Georgios Samaras (Celtic)</p>",
  "<p>My mother Sheila Finch, who has died aged 92, was an outstanding teacher and NUT representative. An independent-minded woman, she lead and unusual life - sometimes sad but always interesting.</p> <p>Born Sheila Richardson in Dublin to an English father and an Irish mother, she was a little child at the time when the Black and Tans (Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force) were terrorising the local population. When her father contracted TB, a neighbour told her mother that God was punishing her for having married a Protestant. Sheila's mother replied: \"Well, God gave me three fine children and you none.\"</p> <p>No doubt this sassiness contributed to Sheila's unorthodox mindset. Her father died when she was 10 and her mother when she was 20; even greater grief followed when her beloved youngest brother, Ernie, volunteered for the merchant navy during the second world war (Irish nationals did not have to join the forces) and was lost in 1942. It took years for the merchant navy's wartime contribution to be recognised, but Sheila eventually had the satisfaction of knowing Ernie's name was engraved on the Tower Hill memorial. </p> <p>She moved to London soon after and there met her future husband, Joe Finch, a Jewish communist, and, like her, from a poor family. After the war, they both went on teacher-training courses and this started Sheila's career. She and her two brothers had been passionate readers, but Sheila as the girl was expected to leave school without academic qualifications to help at home. Her surviving brother, Fred, went on to become the top-ranking civil servant in the Irish treasury. Sheila, highly intelligent herself, would have gone to university in a later generation. </p> <p>As it was, class after class of five-to seven-year-olds were the winners, first at the George Eliot school in north London, then from 1955 until 1976 at Kidbrooke Park school in Blackheath. Sheila was an imaginative, innovative teacher - patient or stimulating as needed. Junior school colleagues said they were always pleased to get the children who had been taught by her. And, if friends and acquaintances less progressive than herself attacked immigration, she used to say: \"Well, I'm an immigrant, and I've taught a thousand British children to read and write.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> She leaves her husband, two children - myself and my brother Jonathan - and three grandchildren, Sam, Jess and Aureliano.</p>",
  "<p>Just as an entire generation of British schoolboys can perfectly recite Monty Python's parrot sketch, there are few American crime writers of the hardboiled school who cannot quote verbatim the opening to James Crumley's novel The Last Good Kiss: \"When I finally caught up with Abraham Traherne, he was drinking beer with an alcoholic bulldog named Fireball Roberts, in a ramshackle joint just outside of Sonoma, California, drinking the heart right out of a fine spring afternoon.\" The novel was only Crumley's second foray into crime fiction but it brought him instant cult status among writers and readers of the genre.</p> <p>Crumley, who has died aged 68, grew up in south Texas, but is most closely associated with his adopted home town of Missoula, Montana. After high school, he enlisted in the US army, then attended college in Texas, graduating with a history degree in 1964. He took an MA in creative writing at the University of Iowa and his thesis, based on his army experiences, was published as the novel One to Count Cadence in 1969. The book was well received by US critics but remained unpublished in Britain until 1994.</p> <p>A career in university teaching beckoned, but when Crumley joined the English faculty at the University of Montana he discovered Raymond Chandler and was inspired to try his hand at the private eye story with The Wrong Case (1976), which introduced Montana-based detective Milo Milodragovitch. The Last Good Kiss followed in 1978 with another Montana detective, CW Sughrue, and cult status was assured when Milo returned for a second outing in Dancing Bear in 1983.</p> <p>As with Chandler, Crumley's plots took second place behind his characters and the language of the prose, and Crumley was hailed as \"the rightful heir\" to Chandler. Yet his detective heroes were distinctly of the post-60s generation in their attitudes to drugs and alcohol, enjoying consumption to excess.</p> <p>In fact, all the characters in Crumley's novels are distinctly offbeat, with skewed views of life. The violence that is usually meted out to them is described in a graphic, unsentimental, yet lyrical way, earning the author the sobriquet \"the poet of hard-boiled\".</p> <p>His first three detective novels gained him an instant ranking alongside Elmore Leonard, James Ellroy and James Lee Burke, as well as a dedicated following of fans, among them Dennis Lehane, George Pelecanos and Michael Connelly, who were to emerge as the following generation of American mystery writers.</p> <p>It was to be 10 years, however, before Crumley returned to the crime novel, as he was to be distracted by the lure of Hollywood. Although involved in numerous projects, including an adaptation of James Ellroy's The Big Nowhere, it is thought that not one word written by Crumley ever made it on to the big screen.</p> <p>He was happier back home in Montana and eventually produced The Mexican Tree Duck in 1993, a second case for detective Sughrue (\"Sug as in sugar, rue as in rue the fucking day\").</p> <p>In 1996, he teamed up his two detectives, Milogradovitch and Sughrue, on a violent revenge mission to the Texas-Mexico border in Bordersnakes. If the plotting was somewhat hazy, Crumley's lyricism and his eye for absurd but always human characters were still much in evidence, and his true return to form came in 2001 with The Final Country, which won the British Crime Writers' Silver Dagger award.</p> <p>Financial problems and poor health, almost certainly due to his love of most things alcoholic, prevented him from travelling to London to collect his award in 2002, and friends and former students from Montana launched an appeal to help fund his medical treatment.</p> <p>There was to be only one further addition to the Crumley crime canon of seven novels over 30 years, another Sughrue mystery, The Right Madness (2005). Probably the most autobiographical of his crime novels, it ruminates on ill-health, divorce, drink, drugs and his detective facing the prospect of semi-retirement. After years of searching for missing persons, his hero reflects: \"I haven't even found myself. Of course, I haven't looked all that hard, yet.\"</p> <p>Crumley is survived by his fifth wife, Martha Elizabeth, a poet and artist. He had five children, three from his second marriage and two from his fourth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> James Arthur Crumley, crime writer, born October 12 1939; died September 17 2008</p>",

  "<p><strong>Hewlett has missed the point on Scotland </strong><br>Steve Hewlett is barking up the wrong tree in his analysis of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission (Scotland: the not so brave, September 15). In fact, he is so out of touch he is lost in the woods entirely. Earlier this month the Commission produced an ambitious and challenging vision for the future of Scottish broadcasting. It has been widely discussed and praised in the Scottish media and is already being seen as marking a turning point for the industry in this part of the UK.</p> <p>Steve says accusingly that \"the commission has created a consensus across political lines\", as though this were some kind of deplorable failure rather than the deserved result of a thorough, honest and independent investigation in which all parties - political and industrial - had their say.</p> <p>Scotland has more newspaper titles available every morning than any other part of the UK. But in all the coverage of the Commission's report, not a single editorial - indeed not a single columnist - has shared Steve's three main criticisms.

  "<h2>What's going on?</h2> <p> I'm going on: Gordon Brown didn't quite use the Wilson formula, but that was the gist of the message in his Andrew Marr interview.</p> <p>He said: \"I happen to think I am better prepared to deal with it than<br>perhaps anyone, because you can't deal with it by slogans and PR and good soundbites, you have to deal with it by the wisdom of the decisions you make.\"</p> <p>But Charles Clarke wasn't happy: \"The one thing which I think is completely unacceptable is to ignore the real political situation in the country and drift along, assuming we will somehow pull it around ... It won't be all right on the night,\" the former home secretary told the BBC, renewing his demand for a debate in the party about Brown's leadership.</p> <h2>Defeat looming</h2> <p> A poll for the Mail on Sunday showed the SNP ahead in Glenrothes, on 44% to Labour's 41%. And Charlie Whelan, Brown's ex spin doctor and now political director of Unite told a fringe meeting that a survey of the union's 4,000 members in the constituency also showed that \"currently the SNP are ahead\".</p> <h2>Red blood or blue blood</h2> <p>Those lap-dancing discounts for Tories: Catherine Arakelian, a delegate, wasn't impressed by the news the welcome pack sent to people attending the Conservative conference includes a voucher offering a discount for a lap-dancing club. \"Clearly red-blooded Tory men are more interested in women up poles than women at the polls,\" she said.</p> <h2>Children's rights</h2> <p> Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, said the government would sign the UN convention on the rights of the child in full this week.</p> <p>Until now the UK has had an opt-out allowing asylum seekers and other migrants to be detained without judicial oversight.</p> <h2>Three out of 10</h2> <p> That's the value of Gordon Brown's career prospects, according to the set of political trump cards produced by Sky. David Cameron scores nine out of 10 on this measure.</p> <h2>An Iraq liberation</h2> <p> \"It's also clear that the post-war peace has been far less successful than the pre-war planning. I think it's just plain true to say that - it's almost liberating to say that, we shouldn't be ashamed of saying that,\" David Miliband told a fringe meeting. He said Labour should be better at admitting its mistakes.</p> <h2>Why Labour websites shouldn't run membership surveys</h2> <p> \"If you want to wake up on March 2010 and say you were the star blogger of the election, and you got onto Radio Five Live twice, but the price you pay for that is costing Labour votes and David Cameron in Downing Street, then you can fuck off out of the Labour Party and run your own independent blog somewhere. But the point then is that nobody will be interested,\" Derek Draper told a Fabian fringe. He wasn't impressed by the Labourhome survey revealing doubts about Brown.</p> <h2>Love-in</h2> <p> \"To cap it all, at five past<br>midnight I saw Tom Watson MP embrace Barry Gardner MP, Joan Ryan MP and Shioghan McDonagh MP. Tom was, allegedly, the leader of the 2006 'Curry Coup' against Tony Blair, his colleagues, allegedly, leaders of the 2008 'Progress Putsch'.

  "<p>In wake of the \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5319328.stm\">September coup</a>\" two years ago, Tony Blair prefaced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/07/labourleadership.labour\">his statement</a> announcing his impending resignation with an apology to the country on behalf of the Labour party. It had not been, he remarked, the party's \"finest hour\". Gordon Brown should follow his predecessor's example in his speech to this month's annual conference: the past year, he should say, has not been the party's finest.</p> <p>In reality, Brown has little choice. Labour has currently lost permission to be listened to; vast swathes of the public have simply tuned out to what the party has to say. An admission that all has not been well over the past year \u2013 and that voters are justifiably angry about it \u2013 offers one of the few ways to break through to those not inclined to hear the message the prime minister must get across to the country.</p> <p>But a willingness to be frank about the shortcomings of the past year serves a second, perhaps more important, function. It demonstrates that Labour understands that accountability \u2013 taking responsibility for failure, as well as for success \u2013 is critical to the relationship between the state and the citizen. It will show that, having rightly taken a share of the credit for the economic good times over the past decade, the prime minister is prepared to accept a share of the blame: not simply for the current economic difficulties the country is experiencing, but also for the wider problems the government has faced this year. </p> <p>To clear the air, and demonstrate his willingness to learn from mistakes, Brown should \u2013 as Blair did over the 75p pension rise in 2000 \u2013 make an explicit statement that he accepts that the decision to abolish the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jul/01/tax.incometax\">10p tax rate</a> was a mistake, and, on behalf of the government and the party, he apologises unreservedly for it. </p> <p>Showing that he is willing to accept responsibility should act as a stepping-stone to what should be the core message of Brown's speech: the recognition that government in general, and the centre in particular, can no longer do it all and that citizens are going to have to step up as Whitehall and Westminster step back. The prime minister could echo the words of Bill Clinton in 1996: \"The era of big government is over.\" And draw the dividing line with the Tories using the next, less oft-quoted line from Clinton's famous speech: \"But we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.\"</p> <p>So, what should Labour's new progressive contract between citizen and state look like? In Progress' widely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/18/gordonbrown.labour\">reported</a> new pamphlet, <a href=\"http://clients.squareeye.com/uploads/prog/documents/Role of the state pamphlet.pdf\">Beyond Whitehall: A New Vision for a Progressive State</a>, published yesterday, some of the leading lights in New Labour set out the key tenets.</p> <p>First, greater local and individual responsibility. Challenges ranging from climate change to obesity, and pensions to worklessness can only be tackled by both individuals and government each accepting their respective responsibilities. But it must be accompanied by far more power devolved to local government, neighbourhoods and communities, and individual public service users. Why, for instance, shouldn't communities enduring failing local services have a legal right to replace them? And why can't we develop new forms of public ownership \u2013 community-run mutual organisations \u2013 to run local services like children's centres, parks and estates?</p> <p>Second, greater fiscal responsibility. When families are struggling to make ends meet and tightening their belts, so must government too. What about cutting the size of Whitehall by a quarter (why would it need to remain its current size if power is flowing to our town halls) or slashing the number of government ministers? Or why not both? And while he's at it, Brown should signal that the pre-budget report will offer a downpayment on these pledges by providing tax relief to low- and middle-income earners.</p> <p>Finally, greater responsibility from our public services: public spending has traditionally been the first target of the right in an economic downturn \u2013 and the only way to defend that which we know must be spent is to prove it's being wisely spent. There will, therefore, be no let-up in the pace of either public service reform \u2013 with Labour firmly on the side of patients (unlike the Tories), parents and pupils \u2013 or welfare reform. </p> <p>\"Fairness\" is the much-vaunted theme for the government's autumn relaunch. It's a concept hard to disagree with, but also hard to define. Indeed, it's ultimately subjective. It can, for instance, be easily appropriated by rightwing populists, whose notion of it in relation to immigration, tax or crime could have a strong electoral appeal to many in the country in these insecure times. </p> <p>By contrast, reciprocity \u2013 the principle that, in a community, we all have responsibilities to one another \u2013 has always been at the heart of Labour's politics. And it should be at the heart of Gordon Brown's conference speech.</p>",
  "<p>The speakers at yesterday's Fabian event at Manchester Town Hall sat behind the blown-up front cover of the current <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/publications/fabian-review\">Fabian Review</a>: \"Must Labour Lose?'\" Next to it was the title of the debate: \"Can we give the white working class what they want?\"</p> <p>The two questions are not unrelated. Alan Johnson may <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4791039.ece\">joke</a> that the Conservatives have gone from a party of proud Etonians and closet homosexuals to closet Etonians and proud homosexuals, but that does not alter the fact that the white working class has grown disillusioned with Labour. The broad coalition that brought Labour to power in 1997 has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/23/labour.crewebyelection08\">disintegrated</a> under Gordon Brown, and lower socio-economic groups have deserted Labour in the greatest numbers.</p> <p>Two competing theories for the desertion emerged from the session; one emphasised the heart and the other stressed the wallet. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/joncruddas\">Jon Cruddas</a>, MP for Barking and Dagenham, argued that what has been called the \"epic flight of the white working class\" is the consequence of a political strategy that fails to focus on the issues that the white working class face. This, he suggested, was because of New Labour's assumption that the knowledge-based economy would wither away the white working class.</p> <p>Skills and universities secretary John Denham broadly agreed. \"The two areas of the country that have the lowest skills base are Stoke and Barking and Dagenham,\" he told the audience, \"and those are two of the areas where the far right are strongest. This is about the people who have been least able to manage the huge changes \u2013 such as global forces and migration \u2013 that have taken place in society.\" TUC general secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/brendanbarber\">Brendan Barber</a> said migration had driven down standards and undercut established conditions for working people. But <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/images/stories/fabian_review_autumn_trickett_for_web.pdf\">Jon Trickett</a>, MP for Hemsworth, suggested there is a \"cultural and linguistic gap\" between the government and the white working class. And, he went on, the government ignored this group at its peril. He cited a <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2005/rp05-033.pdf\">study</a> of the ten most marginal seats in the country which revealed that social groups D and E outnumber skilled manual workers (C2) by a factor of two to one. It was therefore essential to reach these disaffected ex-Labour supporters. How to do it?</p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2005/rp05-033.pdf\">communities secretary</a> Hazel Blears, it was to stress that Labour was the party that stood for personal gain rather than only philanthropic altruism; that it was the party that gave working people the chance to have some of the things that the middle class took for granted. To win back the white working class, the government had to tell them that if they \"work hard we'll help you get on, live by the rules and we'll protect you from those who don't, make your contribution and we'll give you good services, strive to be good parents and we'll provide good schools and a chance to get your kids to university. And when times are tough we'll use every tool we have to protect you and your family.\"</p> <p>This failed to convince journalist <a href=\"http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/\">Sunny Hundal</a>, who suggested that white working class disaffection called for war on two fronts \u2013 one to argue against claims that they are losing out in the battle of resources, and the second a cultural war \"about the identity of our country and where it is going, a fight about symbols and a sense of community and what is the glue that binds us as a nation.\"</p> <p>I was struck by the fact that during this entire discussion none of the speakers used the word \"immigration\". It was left to the very last questioner during the Q&amp;A session to raise it and suggest that Labour was not tackling \"legitimate fears in a pragmatic way\". This, it seems to me, was a critical question. Trying to find the right language to address white worries can only happen when there is sufficient recognition that the decline in Labour support among the white working class is related to immigration's impact on their lives and the way they feel about living in Britain. Immigration was, Cruddas conceded, the \"prism through which everything else is seen\" \u2013 but how it has affected the white working class, a theme that the BBC examined in a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/white/\">series of films</a>, was not fully addressed; it remains, you could say, the white elephant in the room.<br></p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>&#xa0;</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Morning all.</strong> A healing breeze has blown through the Midlands this week, with all the pre-match injury doubts taking their place in the starting line-up. That means for the home side Gianni Zuiverloon takes his place at the back, alongside Abdoulaye Meite, both of whom have recovered from knack. For Villa, Curtis Davies, Ashley Young and John Carew are all also fresh as daisies and start.</p> <p>No real surprises, then, in either line-up:</p> <p><strong>West Brom: </strong>Carson, Zuiverloon, Meite, Olsson, Robinson,<br>Borja Valero, Morrison, Koren, Greening, Brunt, Bednar. <strong>Subs:</strong><br>Kiely, Hoefkens, Cech, Barnett, Miller, Kim, Moore.</p> <p><strong>Aston Villa:</strong> Friedel, Luke Young, Davies, Laursen, Shorey, Reo-Coker, Petrov, Barry, Ashley Young, Carew, Agbonlahor. <strong>Subs:</strong> Guzan, Milner, Harewood, Knight, Salifou, Cuellar, Gardner.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Mike Dean (Wirral)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong>It's the Black Country/Birmingham/Midlands derby with your Sunday lunch today, with Aston's finest riding high in the Premier League, but facing an always tricky trip to the Handsworth vicinity for a doubtless full-blooded affair against the Baggies. West Brom have just four points from their opening four matches; Villa have seven, which is good for fifth place. They can go second, but West Brom can actually vault 10 places to sixth if they win, leaving clear air between them and perennial mid-table strugglers such as Manchester United. We'll see. Before that: \"What?\" bellows Chris B. \"Tom Lutz too hungover, maybe? Can we now call you Second Choice Swains?\" If only. Fifteenth-choice, more like. (Lutz, incidentally, was injured in the pre-match warm up.)</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Pre-match warm-up news, and frightening Sky Sports shenanigans:</strong> Abdoulaye Meite was injured in the pre-match warm-up (or maybe hadn't actually recovered from his previous knack) and is replaced by Leon Barnett. As part of their introductory package, Sky Sports just interviewed Frank Lampard in a bar, into which the special effects team had planted countless other Frank Lampards, like a very disturbing \"Being John Malkovich\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 mins: </strong> And we're off, with the Hawthorns bathed in late summer sun and my television struggling to cope with it. It's 11 shadows versus 11 shadows at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 mins: </strong>Villa have the early possession, pushing down the left with Petrov and Agbonlahor. No difficulties for West Brom, who shepherd it behind. Early boos for former Baggie Curtis Davies, but otherwise a raucous atmosphere at the Hawthorns.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 mins: </strong>A scrappy passage of play in midfield results in the ball coming to Bednar, who lays off for Jonathan Greening to have a speculative low shot from 25 yards. Friedel falls on it to his right.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>5 mins: </strong>There's more space in these early stages than we might have expected, and Koren is able to whip in a dangerous cross across the six yard box. Villa were pushing up and the ball skews out for a throw. Promising start for West Brom.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 mins: </strong>Carew and Agbonlahor are dropping deep, with the Norwegian, in particular, getting involved in the midfield. He tries to surge forward but is blocked. Tony Mobray sucks happily away on his lemon on the bench.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 mins:</strong> First corner of the match goes to West Brom when Bednar's attempted cross from the right grazes Martin Laursen's leg and goes behind. It's deep, inswung, to the far post, but Curtis Davies clears to token derision from the home crowd, still seemingly seething about the \u00a38m-odd they prised from Villa for the centre-back.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>11 mins: </strong>The frenetic start has slowed somewhat now, with Villa's attempt to launch anything meaningful down the left quickly snuffed out. Better from West Brom, for whom James Morrison out-muscles Petrov in midfield, dances down the right wing and fizzes a decent cross through the penalty area. No one on the end of it, and it goes behind.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>13 mins:</strong> The West Brom back-line stand firm against the probing of Carew. In the midfield, Gareth Barry and Nigel Reo-Coker are switching sides and flicking the ball forward, but Barnett and Olsson stand firm.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 mins: </strong>First real chance of the match, as Ashley Young bends a free-kick from the left on to the sizeable forehead of John Carew. The Norwegian rises highest but directs his header past Carson's left stick.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>16 mins:</strong> Villa's strength this season seems to be the adaptability of just about all their players, with Gareth Barry, for instance, doubling up as left back, then right-sided midfielder in a short spell, and Gabriel Agbonlahor, nominally a centre forward, then popping up on the left wing to collect a clipped ball forward from Nicky Shorey. It all comes to nowt, except even more respect for tactical and motivational genius Martin O'Neill.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 mins:</strong> Suddenly this is an end-to-end encounter. A scrappy hack-and-miss fest in the Baggies' box ends with a tame header from Agbonlahor. Then West Brom break swiftly through the ice-cream Iglessias Borja Valero. His cross reaches no one, and Villa get down the other end, but Carew's cross is too far ahead of Agbonlahor. Breathless.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 mins:</strong> Chris Brunt has picked up an injury and hobbles off, to be replaced by Do-Heon Kim, who fills in naturally on the left side of the attack.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 mins:</strong> West Brom attack in number, but by the time they finally get a cross in, from Paul Robinson, Villa have swarmed their own box and clear. Villa are forced to play on the break, but are over-hitting balls to Carew and Agbonlahor, allowing Carson to gather and launch another home-side attack.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>27 mins: Goal! West Brom 0-1 Aston Villa</strong> <br>As simple as that. Leon Barnett concedes a needless free-kick about 40 yards out and Ashley Young lifts it teasingly into the box, John Carew rises unmarked to flick it past Carson. 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>28 mins: Goal! West Brom 0-2 Aston Villa</strong><br>Nightmare for Leon Barnett, who compounds his previous double-error - giving away the free-kick, then losing Carew - by gifting a second to Villa. A long ball over the top from Ashley Young should be cleared by the Baggies' centre back. But he dithers and dawdles and tries to control it when a hoof it all is necessary and it skews to Gabriel Agbonlahor on the right. He charges onto it at the angle of the box, right, and drills a low shot across Carson and into the far bottom corner. Excellent finish. There were 32 seconds between those two goals.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>32 mins:</strong> West Brom had definitely started the brighter here, but those two goals - essentially both on the break - have pretty much ended this as a contest already. Villa might let in the odd late goal, as against Spurs, but... hold on, I'm the idiot, West Brom have just scored.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>34 mins: Goal! West Brom 1-2 Aston Villa</strong><br>Fine play from West Brom, with Bednar exchanging passes with Koren, ends with the latter having a shy from just outside the box. It's a routine save for Brad Friedel, but he only parries it straight into the path of James Morrison. The winger wants it more than Nickey Shorey, who is also chasing the rebound, and Morrison stabs it past the grounded Friedel. Game back on.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>38 mins: </strong>The goalscorer Morrison goes into the book for delaying a free-kick, from exactly the spot that spawned Villa's first goal. This time it's over-hit from Young and goes harmlessly behind. Paul Robinson then follows him into the book for scything down Stilian Petrov, who is on a mazy dribble in his own half. Luke Young's free kick raises havoc in the box when no one clears and Agbonlahor prepares the shot. But he doesn't get it off in time and West Brom clear. Suddenly it's all happening again.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>40 mins:</strong> Ping-pong in the Villa box now after Koren releases Robinson down the left and his chipped cross nearly picks out Morrison. Martin Laursen clears.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 mins:</strong> Jonathan Greening wriggles to the byeline and hoists a cross onto the penalty spot. None of his teammates have matched the effort and it's easily cleared. On another attack, Paul Robinson launches one forward to Bednar, but Laursen is there again.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>44 mins: </strong>Terrific save from Brad Friedel denies West Brom what would be, frankly, a deserved equaliser. Paul Robinson is given hours of time to whip a cross in from the left, deep, and his arrow picks out the head of Kim, whose header is strong and well directed. Friedel dives to his left and pushes it away, one-handed. Rejoice! An email: \"I like John Carew as a player, but he is a sign of what's wrong with English football,\" says Gary Naylor. \"He's nowhere near good enough to play in a side with ambitions for the title, but much too good to play in a side threatened with relegation. It's not their fault, but the John Carews of the Premier League (and there's a fair few of them) make for a predictable season.\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45 mins: </strong>Corner for Villa is too near to Scott Carson, who punches clear. And that's the last meaningful action of a compelling first-half, with Villa leading 2-1 but West Brom cheered off the pitch after an energetic, and not unskillful, showing. Back in 15.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time email:</strong> \"Wotcha,\" greets Nick Glynn, as though in the playground. \"West Brom are another of our (Villa's) \"local rivals\" whose fans have a passionate dislike for us, which is, as far as I'm aware, not in any way reciprocated amongst Villa fans. Coventry have the same problem. Why can't we all just get along?\" Aaah, a plea for solidarity and peace in the Midlands. \"Except with Birmingham City, obviously. Screw them all the way to hell.\" Oh.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>46 mins: </strong>This is just a fact - no glossing: Gabriel Agbonlahor has just thrown up on the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 mins: </strong>As Agbonlahor continues to re-examine his half-time orange splattered on the pitch, no one picks up the West Brom defender Gianni Zuiverloon who decides to have a shot from just outside the box. It's dipping viciously, but too late and it flies over Friedel's bar.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>48 mins:</strong> Terrific start for the Baggies who are closing down swiftly in midfield and feeding their wide players. With Bednar waiting in the middle, Robinson swings one in from the left, forcing Laursen to head clear. Then Curtis Davies gets to one before the onrushing Kim and earns the boos of the home fans when he hacks it away.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>50 mins: </strong>Ashley Young is called into defensive action to clear yet another cross from Robinson, but Villa go right up the other end and almost bag a third. Nigel Reo-Coker stabs a ball outside the full back and perfectly onto the run on John Carew. The Norwegian aims his low shot across Scott Carson, but it grazes the outside of the post and out.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>52 mins:</strong> A neat combination between Petrov and Ashley young on the left - Young delicately backheeling into Petrov's dashing run - is crudely ended by Valero, who chops down the Bulgarian and sees yellow.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54 mins: </strong>John Carew hits the post again! Stilian Petrov, who is playing very well here against the odds, exchanges passes with Luke Young on the right and picks out Carew in the middle. A deft nudge into the centre-back's back earns the extra space for the Norwegian and he angles his downward header wide of Carson, but still can't beat the post.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>57 mins:</strong> Here comes the full force of Tony Mobray's chalk-board as two strikers strip off on the bench ready to join the action. Luke Moore and Ishmael Miller replace Bednar and Valero.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>59 mins: </strong>West Brom will now revert to a more formal 4-4-2 with the new arrivals taking their place up front in place of the largely ineffective Valero and Bednar. Moore, if I remember from his Villa days, has bags of pace and could trouble his former teammates if they can give him something to run onto. West Brom have a corner, and some sustained pressure, which ends with Greening whipping in a cross from the left. Moore stabs goalward, but Barry gets a leg in just in the nick of time.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>62 mins:</strong> Ismael Miller gets into the action, but has dropped inexplicably deep and shows a real striker's touch in midfield, stumbling over the ball and then committing a needless foul. Villa hoist the free kick into the box, West Brom clear behind, and Villa's corner also comes to little.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>64 mins:</strong> Again Miller loses the ball, this time as he gets too tricky on the left side of the Villa box. The visitors flood forward and Barry tees up Ashley Young on the edge of the box. He beats his first man, but the shot is charged down.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>66 mins:</strong> Villa seem happy to leave Robinson alone on the left, dropping off the overlapping full-back, which seems like a dangerous policy. This time his cross comes to nothing, but he won't need many more invitations. At the other end, the free-scoring Nigel Reo-Coker (two goals in a year, in the last two games) has a shot from 25 yards, which Carson palms behind for another corner.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>68 mins: </strong>Much better from Miller, who powers past Luke Young, who picks up a yellow card for hauling him down. West Brom waste the free-kick, though, when they send it deep towards the on-rushing Leon Barnett, but he fails to get it into the danger area under the attentions of Nicky Shorey.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>70 mins:</strong> West Brom are again pressing, but Villa are smartly leaving Carew, Agbonlahor and Ashley Young well up the pitch to set up the potential of some formidable counter-attacking. Carew controls in the centre circle, feeds Young on the left, and his scamper forward is checked by Zuiverloon. Reo-Coker then has another shot at goal, this time from the edge of the box and scuffed harmlessly wide.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>72 mins:</strong> Miller is proving to be a robust force up front, but Villa crowd him out. Tony Mowbray calls Luke Moore over for instruction, which will presumably include the directive to touch the ball every once in a while. Villa, meanwhile, line up three subs of their own.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>75 mins: </strong>Villa sub: James Milner replaces Nicky Shorey. The domino effect: Luke Young goes to left back, Nigel Reo-Coker to right back. John Carew booked, although not as a direct result of that.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>76 mins:</strong> Jonathan Greening turns the new Villa right back Reo-Coker inside out and crosses towards Miller. Friedel snaffles it, just as the centre forward winds up the eyebrows. Reo-Coker recovers to go on a surging run at the other end, but can't quite get his own cross in after he gets all the way to the dead-ball line.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>79 mins:</strong> There's the danger for West Brom as they're crowded out on the edge of the Villa box and it breaks to John Carew. He powers across the half-way line, then yields to James Milner to scamper to the edge of the box. Milner is fouled and Villa have a free-kick just outside the box, but Ashley Young can't beat the wall.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>82 mins: </strong>Second sub for Villa - Craig Gardner replaces Stilian Petrov. Like for like, like.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>83 mins: </strong>James Morrison has a shot from 25 yards, which rises all the way over the bar. Andy Murray wins in the Davies Cup for Great Britain. Koren and Greening try to manufacture something down the left wing, which Barry clears. Ronaldo and Didier Drogba are on the bench. Pick the bones out of that.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>86 mins:</strong> Last hurrah from West Brom, or a workmanlike stiffling from Villa? We'll know in about five minutes. Villa are defending deep, and deny Moore then Koren as they break into the box.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>88 mins: </strong>Yellow card for Ashley Young, who is late into a challenge with Leon Barnett, round about the half-way line. There's a scramble in the Villa box after the ball is lifted in, twice, but Barnett fouls his marker and Villa can eat up another few seconds.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> And another couple of seconds disappear for West Brom as John Carew is replaced by Carlos Cuellar.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90+1 mins:</strong>Four added minutes to play, the first of which sees a corner for West Brom, wasted. Friedel then takes his time over the goal kick and Villa are running the clock down efficiently.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90+3 mins:</strong> This one's all over. \"There's only one Curtis Davies\" chant the Villa fans, in defense of their centre-back who's been the target of the West Brom boo-boys. The Midlands' Sol Campbell, if you will. Anyway, nothing else to report as the clock ticks down.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Full-time: </strong>Peep, peep! A jaunty little jump from Martin O'Neill and that's a third away win in the space of five days for Villa. Switch over to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/21/premierleague.chelsea\">Paul Doyle's coverage of Chelsea v Manchester United</a>. Thanks for your interest. Bye.</p>"
