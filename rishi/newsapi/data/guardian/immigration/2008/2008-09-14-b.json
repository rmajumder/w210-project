  "<p>A controversial new US tactic to mount counter-terrorist operations inside Pakistan has met with fresh hostility, it emerged yesterday, as Pakistani tribesmen representing half a million people vowed to switch sides and join the Taliban if Washington does not stop cross-border attacks by its forces from Afghanistan.</p> <p>Reacting to American missile attacks in north Waziristan last week, which followed an unprecedented cross-border ground assault earlier this month, tribal chiefs from the area called an emergency meeting on Saturday.</p> <p>\"If America doesn't stop attacks in tribal areas, we will prepare a lashkar [army] to attack US forces in Afghanistan,\" tribal chief Malik Nasrullah announced in Miran Shah, north Waziristan's largest city. \"We will also seek support from the tribal elders in Afghanistan to fight jointly against America.\"</p> <p>The development threatens to widen the conflict, with previously moderate people from Pakistan's tribal border region with Afghanistan in danger of joining Taliban militants based in the area. They have reacted furiously to intensified American missile attacks on targets in the tribal territory in recent weeks.</p> <p>The issue is likely to feature in talks between Gordon Brown and Pakistan's new president, Asif Ali Zardari, this week. Zardari, who is on a private visit to Britain, is due to meet Brown tomorrow. The prime minister is likely to press for greater Pakistani action against militants in the tribal area and may go along with US calls to integrate the tribal territory into the conflict in Afghanistan as one theatre of war, an idea Pakistan will fiercely resist. </p> <p>Zardari and Pakistan's prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, said in a joint statement at the weekend: \"The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country should be respected at all cost.\" During the past month, there have been seven US missile strikes in the tribal area, about the same number as in the whole of last year. A US ground assault in south Waziristan provoked a sharp rebuke from the Pakistan army.</p> <p>Washington believes that Taliban and al-Qaida militants fighting the western coalition in Afghanistan are using Pakistan's tribal area as a safe haven. </p> <p>But Ayaz Wazir, a retired Pakistani diplomat who is a tribal chief from south Waziristan, warned: \"If the Americans are coming to sort it out with force, they would create more enemies. The Americans might have supersonic jets and we might have to fight with stones in our hands, but we will stand up.\"</p> <p>Up to now, only a tiny minority of the tribesmen have joined the Pakistani or Afghan Taliban movements, but incursions by the US could ignite the area.</p> <p>The heightened US activity comes just as some Pakistani tribes have risen against the Taliban in the border areas of Dir and Bajaur. But hatred of America would far surpass any dislike for Islamic extremists.</p>",

Photograph: Murdo Macleod</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Over <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2\">in G2</a> today there's another excellent piece on Ferran Adria's <br>restaurant El Bulli. Once again, a journalist has made the pilgrimage <br>and, once again, reports a gamut of responses to the food ranging from <br>tears of joy to bewilderment. What's different about this report is <br>that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adriansearle\">Adrian Searle</a> is an art specialist.</p> <p>In the two decades since he became head chef at El Bulli, Adria has <br>danced closer and closer to the point where food meets art. In recent <br>years he has tantalised diners by talking of closing the restaurant, <br>not just for the six months a year he currently sets aside to develop <br>his ideas but entirely - running just a single table where he can <br>reveal his great works to the eager media. Like everything Adria does, <br>this challenges us, in this case forcing us to think about a point <br>where running a restaurant and being an artist diverge.</p> <p>As long as El Bulli is open to the public, Adria is running a business <br>and it's interesting to try to work out what kind of business it is. <br>To me El Bulli is becoming more and more like a gallery: a place where <br>critics and wealthy collectors gather to test their own <br>interpretations and values against 'the work'. And it seems that <br>Adria, with his intriguing new opening hours wants to take things even <br>further - no longer a gallery open to the public, just private <br>showings to those who can influence the market.<br><br>Heston Blumenthal, usually mentioned in the same breath as Adria, is <br>also a wizard of 'molecular gastronomy' (even if <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/foodmonthly/futureoffood/story/0,,1969722,00.html\">he rejects the term</a>), but his business model is very different. Blumenthal is English and as such seems embarrassed to offer himself as either artist or a public intellectual. At his restaurant, The Fat Duck, he uses a molecular menu to offer punters a culinary thrill ride. He has the science and technique to offer us experiences we can't get elsewhere. </p> <p>Okay, maybe the kind of people who can afford \u00a3200 for a 14 course menu (without wine) aren't exactly everyday punters but importantly his food is there to delight anyone who can afford it - or spend time saving for a treat. It's not exactly populist (his excellent TV programmes take care of that) but at least it's designed to be broadly accessible in taste and doesn't require mediation by experts. Heston's not planning to close any time soon because he isn't running a gallery, he's running a theme park and to do so he recognises he needs customers.</p> <p>I'm glad that Adria is getting the critical attention from the art world that he wants. He's a genuine guy and believes in what he's doing. Whether a cook is an artist or a craftsman is an involved debate that probably deserves a separate airing but, for me at least, one thing is sure: a restaurant shouldn't be a gallery. A place where a chef can have ideas and occasionally release them to a waiting world is irrelevant to me as a food lover and a restaurant goer, and it seems I'm not alone. In the couple of decades that Adria has been developing his techniques, the rest of the restaurant world has remained singularly unaffected. </p> <p>In the last year, I've been privileged to eat at some of London's most exciting new restaurants, Great Queen Street, Quo Vadis, The Giaconda Dining Room, Market, Hereford Road and in any one of them, a request for a glass of foam or a savoury ice-cream would have resulted in a quick exit to the alley out the back to be punched in the head by a sous chef. As restaurants generally raise their game, it seems that Adria's influence is fugatory. It evaporates like what he would undoubtedly call a 'parmesan air' - recognised by diners as cheesy wind.</p> <p>The only place that molecular techniques have gained any kind of toehold are in the sort of international high-end restaurants where an oyster, pine-smoked under a bell jar has taken over from the crepe suzette trolley as a display of conspicuous tableside theatre for the expenses crowd. Without the intellectual context of Adria's gallery, just so much stunt food.</p> <p>A restaurant isn't a place where ideas are interpreted and disseminated, it's a commercial operation for the ravishment of the senses. We don't go for challenge or enlightenment we go in to be competently pleasured in exchange for money. A theme park is an extreme version and fun once in a while but, for me at least, a restaurant is best compared to a brothel - affordable sensual enjoyment that doesn't require intellectual engagement or explanation by experts.</p>",
  "<p>He is a fortunate fellow, Greg Wise, but fortunately he knows it. \"I am,\" he says, \"very fortunate.\" He's dashed handsome, obviously, which is never an obstacle to an actor, and can indeed be a positive help when it comes to sweeping in on your charger, all buckskin breeches and big black cape, and rescuing poor bedraggled Kate Winslet from a spot of inclement English weather. That was the film in which he really made his name; Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, 13 years ago now.</p> <p>He's good, too; you only have to watch his minutely controlled, alarmingly enigmatic performance in ITV1's upcoming drama A Place of Execution to see that. Wise plays Philip Hawkin, the suave and supercilious squire of a remote 1960s Northumberland village accused of murdering his 13-year-old stepdaughter by an ambitious young detective. It's a first-class, edge-of-your-seat thriller, co-starring a magisterial Juliet Stevenson as an obsessive present-day TV reporter reeling in an increasingly reeking 40-year-old story.</p> <p>Wise shares his life with actor, writer, director and double Oscar-winner Emma Thompson, whom he famously met on the set of Sense and Sensibility (\"April 30, 1994, 8.20am,\" she recorded in her diary. \"Greg Wise turned up to ride, full of beans and looking gorgeous. Ruffled all our feathers a bit.\") The couple give every appearance of being extremely happy. </p> <p>Most fortunately of all, though, Wise is not hung up on acting. He's passionate about it, he talks about it thoughtfully and intelligently, but it's just one of the things he does, and he doesn't do it all that often. He also builds houses, makes documentaries (well, one so far, but it was highly acclaimed), spends as much time as he can with his daughter, and is trying to develop an individual biogas-digester for Africa. (I don't know what that is either, but he'll tell us later.)</p> <p>\"I love what I do very much,\" he insists, when we meet on the top floor of a well-known Soho arts and media club of which he is proud not to be a member. \"But I don't do a lot of it. Acting is not my primary drive in life, although I'd be a very unhealthy person without it. It's just I've always been more interested in doing more than one thing. And I think I'd be a very different person - and a very different actor - were I to work more.\"</p> <p>He first demonstrated this rare insouciance by clearing off to work with disabled kids in Nottingham straight after graduating from drama school, and then heading to Australia and going travelling. After landing his first acting job, he took off again. Years later, in 1995, after Sense and Sensibility, and with half the world's agents desperate to offer him work, he flew to LA, walked into the office of the president of Sony Pictures, and told him he really didn't want to work in America. \"Then I flew back to London and worked as a builder for a year. So that was career suicide, obviously.\"</p> <p>Wise jokes about this, but it's plain he means it. \"If the point of a performance is to recreate an emotion that I believe you can only really have in real life,\" he says, \"my fear, if I did a lot more, is that I'd start to look at parts and go, 'Ooh, that's just like my role in X.' So actually what you'd end up doing is recreating a recreation. It's incredibly important for me to explore other things, to allow myself idiot time, and to allow myself time to fail. I mean, very few of us playing a murderer will actually have killed someone. But you have to find whatever it is in your experiences that lets you into that: for me, the time in between is just as important as the time doing. I think I'd be a poorer craftsman if I did more.\"</p> <p>Bit of a luxury, isn't it, though, to be in that position? \"Oh yes. I'm very fortunate. I don't have to go out and chase the work. If I was the main source of income for the family ... I used to make quite a good living, you know. Now I earn less and less and less each year.\" He grins. \"And I've got nothing in the pipeline at all. Terrible, isn't it. There's nothing planned at all. I am very much available for work.\"</p> <p>Thompson, or \"Em\", is different. \"She'll know, for example, that the first day of principal filming on Nanny McPhee will be on May the something next year. That gives a certain shape. It's not that I'm laid-back or laissez-faire; I'm constantly involved in projects. But life for me is basically crisis management. I never know what I'm doing from week to week. On the other hand, most of the most wonderful things in life are unplanned. And I've really never understood worriers.\"</p> <p>For two people with such different approaches to their agendas, the Wise-Thompson household seems to function harmoniously. The couple have recently set up a small film company and are trying to raise finance for a project that \"Em has written, and I've edited, and is a bloody good piece of work, frankly, set in the 1850s\". Other than that, their professional paths rarely cross - and there's not a hint of rivalry. </p> <p>\"It helps, when acting couples form, if one is already doing well,\" says Wise (and maybe, too, if one is a bit older: at 42, Wise is seven years Thompson's junior.) \"I think if both are hungry, and one starts to do a lot better than the other ... That can cause problems. But from the outset, I knew I was with someone who had already won one Oscar and was about to win another. So the question simply doesn't arise.\" </p> <p>Born into a family of fine artists, sculptors, architects and engineers, Wise actually trained as an architect in Edinburgh for three years before switching to drama college in Glasgow, and is still deeply interested in design: \"We have a cottage in Scotland and I spend time redoing old barns, creating spaces, playing around with friends, knocking walls down in their flats, that kind of thing.\"</p> <p>He sees similarities between the two disciplines: \"You're given a brief, a space, an aspect; you use your imagination and what's tangibly there to create an experience for your onlookers. It's just using a different medium.\" Making his 2005 documentary, on the legendary rock'n'roll TV producer Jack Good, felt like bringing \"a lot of things together\", he says. He'd like to do more. \"I filmed it all, edited it all, and for the first time I felt like I was using all my muscles. It was holistic process. It took seven years, but I loved it.\"</p> <p>Other things Wise loves: the couple's eight-year-old daughter Gaia (parenting \"never gets easy. It's less emotionally knackering now, but more intellectually knackering\"). Tindyebwa Agaba, or Tindy, the former child soldier from Rwanda the couple met at a Refugee Council party in 2003 and took under their wing soon after - his father had died of Aids, his mother and sister were listed as missing by the Red Cross - and who is now in his third year studying politics at Exeter University (\"We don't really want to talk much about him if that's OK; it's hard enough for him as it is. But he's doing very well\"). And biogas digesters.</p> <p>\"I'm very interested in poo,\" he says. \"We don't have a very good relationship with poo, and we should have.\" Wise adores spending time in Africa \"getting dirty\" and is involved in several small development schemes there, including the successful twinning of Gaia's primary school with one in Rwanda. One project is to develop individual biogas digesters - \"basically a bucket of poo and a diesel drum\" - that could be used for cooking. \"Most households have a few chickens and a goat or two,\" he says. \"Did you know that if you dig a well in a village you reduce the incidence of rape and abuse, because the women and girls don't have to walk to fetch the water? It would be the same if you could set up a biogas form of cooking: they wouldn't have to go out for wood.\"</p> <p>Just at the moment, he's rather in love with his latest production, based on a novel by Val McDermid. \"It's quite rare that the feedback from almost every quarter is good,\" he says. \"I really think A Place of Execution is good. One of the wonderful strengths is the enigmatic quality everybody has. No one gives anything away. That's very important; it's a problem today that we tend to show everything - we've stopped asking the audience to do a bit of work. It's what Ang Lee was always telling me: 'Do less, do less.' So you tone it down 'til you're practically comatose, and when you see the final product you think, 'I'm doing way too much!'\"</p> <p>He very much likes his character, Hawkin. Having finally \"stopped, for whatever reason, being a luvvie on a horse\", Wise finds it \"fascinating not to play the moral agenda\". \"It's good to explore your darkness,\" he says. \"It was Jung who said we have to embrace our darkness, wasn't it? You'd have to ask the missus about this, but I'm basically quite a light, happy, contented being. And to understand that that's buoyed up by darkness ... Fascinating.\" Greg Wise, buoyed up by darkness? Can't see it myself: he seems far too sorted. Maybe he \"toned it down\".</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 A Place of Execution </strong>begins on September 22 on ITV1</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday September 16 2008.

  "<p>A secret phone tapping operation which tracked the Omagh bombers on their way to commit the deadliest atrocity in the history of the Troubles could provide vital new evidence against the Real IRA, families of victims said yesterday.</p> <p>Evidence emerged yesterday of hitherto unknown taps carried out by GCHQ, the government's electronic communication interception service, as the apparent bombers crossed the border from the Republic of Ireland on August 15 1998 on their way to plant the device. </p> <p>Lawyers for the families believe the intercepts could add weight to a current civil case against five alleged members of the Real IRA, including founder Michael McKevitt. The dissident republican group was behind the Saturday afternoon attack which killed 29 men, women and children and two unborn babies.</p> <p>The existence of the phone-tap evidence is revealed in a Panorama investigation to be broadcast on BBC1 tonight which features claims that the evidence was not passed on to police, and that if it had been the attack could have been averted and the terrorists caught.</p> <p>\"It is totally shattering,\" said Michael Gallagher, chairman of the Omagh Support and Self Help Group, which represents the families of victims. \"The possibility that the people who were plotting the bomb in Omagh could have been caught in the act, stopped and apprehended is a very sobering thought for the families.\"</p> <p>The phone taps would not be admissible in a criminal court but the families are hopeful they can be used in their civil case, which resumes in Belfast tomorrow. Lawyers are exploring whether security agents, including listeners at GCHQ, could act as witnesses. According to Panorama, the surveillance was ordered by the head of special branch in the south region of Northern Ireland, amid a spate of increasingly violent attacks by dissident republicans. The police commander told the BBC he asked GCHQ for \"live\" monitoring of a mobile phone that had been used in an earlier bombing at Banbridge in Co Down. A police unit was placed on standby to step in if GCHQ got a fix on the mobile again.</p> <p>About one and a half hours before the blast, the listening post in Cheltenham traced a call to the suspect phone and picked up the words: \"We're crossing the line\", meaning entering UK territory.</p> <p>With 44 minutes to go, the words \"the bricks are in the wall\" were heard on the same phone, a code understood to mean the bomb was in place. After the blast the target mobile called an accountant in Kilkenny and the name \"Seamus\" was used. Panorama claims the voice was identified as Seamus Daly, a 28-year-old who is one of the five men accused in the civil case.</p> <p>Ray White, a former assistant chief constable of the Northern Ireland police service, told Panorama that special branch received none of this information until the following Tuesday. White said that when special branch asked why the information came so late, GCHQ said: \"We missed it.\"</p> <p>Another BBC source said the intercepts were with special branch \"within five to six hours\", but CID logs show their detectives received no substantive briefing until three weeks later, and even then it was \"sanitised\".</p> <p>Questions over how the tapping operation was handled led to renewed calls this weekend for a public inquiry into the 10-year criminal investigation, which has resulted in no successful prosecutions.</p> <p>\"After the bomb exploded, the intelligence agencies didn't go to the police and give them every inch of what they had which could help them find the bombers at an early stage,\" said Gallagher. \"There are real questions for the prime minister and the Irish taoiseach. Before this came up we had requested a meeting with Gordon Brown and he wrote back and basically said he was too busy. Now the landscape has changed and we expect a meeting with him so he can explain what happened.\"</p> <p>The Northern Ireland police ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, said yesterday the phone tapping evidence could have averted the atrocity. \"There are a very limited number of access routes to Omagh town,\" she said. \"And if they came to the view that that was where a device was being taken, it would seem to me there could have been roadblocks set up. They would have seen this and would have just abandoned the bombs by the roadside.\"</p> <p>Last December, a Belfast judge cleared Sean Hoey, the only man ever charged in direct connection with the car bomb attack, of any involvement.</p> <p>Some of the families are pursuing a civil case against alleged terrorists Colm Murphy, Liam Campbell, Seamus McKenna and Seamus Daly as well as McKevitt for involvement in the bomb plot. All five deny the allegations.</p> <p>The Northern Ireland policing board said yesterday it would ask Sir Hugh Orde, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to consider the possible use of the phone-tap evidence in the criminal investigation: \"We need to see whether this is new evidence that would assist the investigation, or if this is something that police are aware of.\"</p> <p>In 2006, Orde said that \"the Security Service did not withhold intelligence that was relevant or would have progressed the criminal Omagh inquiry\". Earlier this year the board concluded that there was virtually no chance of charges being brought against anyone in the Real IRA, unless new evidence emerged. The families are demanding an urgent search to see if any of the bugging evidence still exists and could be digitally enhanced, which could allow the voices to be connected with names. A spokeswoman for the Northern Ireland Office said: \"We never comment on issues of this nature.\"</p> <h2>Key figures</h2> <p><strong>Sir Ronnie Flanagan</strong></p> <p>Head of Royal Ulster Constabulary at the time of the bombing. Flanagan was in charge of the police service when it reformed in 2001 as the Police Service of Northern Ireland. A report by the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland criticised his role in the Omagh investigation. He is now HM chief inspector of constabulary.</p> <p><strong>Michael McKevitt</strong></p> <p>Founder of Real IRA. McKevitt, 59, from Co Louth, is serving 20 years in jail for terrorist offences related to the Real IRA. He quit the Provisional IRA and founded the Real IRA in protest at the former's participation in the peace process. He is married to Bernadette Sands, sister of the hunger striker Bobby Sands. </p> <p><strong>Sir Francis Richards</strong></p> <p>Director of GCHQ at the time of the bombing. Richards was one month into the job when the Real IRA hit Omagh, having succeeded Sir Kevin Tebbit at Cheltenham. He was also on the frontline of the UK's intelligence response to the September 11 terrorist attacks and served until 2003, when he became governor of Gibraltar, a posting which lasted until 2006.</p> <p><strong>Michael Gallagher</strong></p> <p>Chairman of Omagh Support and Self Help Group. Gallagher's 21-year-old son, Aidan, was killed in the blast that ripped through the Co Tyrone town. He now fronts a civil action on behalf of 19 relatives of people killed in the attack aimed at holding five men as well as the \"corporate entity\" of the Real IRA responsible.</p>",
  "<p>Shane Clarke had no reason to be suspicious when his wife took their two children to Japan to see their ill grandmother in January.</p> <p>The couple had married four years earlier after meeting online, and settled down with their daughters, aged three and one, in the west Midlands. Clarke, they agreed, would join his family in Japan in May for a holiday, and they would all return together.</p> <p>Last week, however, he faced his wife and her lawyer in a Japanese courtroom, uncertain if he would ever see his children again. When his wife left the UK, Clarke now believes, she never had any intention of returning with him, or of letting her children see him. </p> <p>\"From the moment I met her at Narita airport I knew something was wrong,\" Clarke told the Guardian before a custody hearing in Mito, north of Tokyo. \"I soon realised she'd played me like a grand piano. The whole thing had been orchestrated,\" he claims.</p> <p>Clarke, a 38-year-old management consultant from West Bromwich, has gone to great lengths to win custody. The Crown Prosecution Service said his wife could be prosecuted in the UK under the 1984 child abduction act.</p> <p>However, he can expect little sympathy from Japanese courts, which do not recognise parental child abduction as a crime and habitually rule in favour of the custodial - Japanese - parent.</p> <p>Japan is the only G7 nation not to have signed the 1980 Hague convention on civil aspects of child abduction, which requires parents accused of abducting their children to return them to their country of habitual residence. He is one of an estimated 10,000 parents, divorced or separated from their Japanese spouses, who have been denied access to their children. Since the Hague treaty came into effect, not a single ruling in Japan has gone in favour of the foreign parent.</p> <p>Campaigners say Japan's refusal to join the treaty's 80 other signatories has turned it into a haven for child abductors.</p> <p>The European Union, Canada and the US have urged Japan to sign, but Takao Tanase, a law professor at Chuo University, says international pressure is unlikely to have much impact. \"In Japan, if the child is secure in its new environment and doesn't want more disruption, family courts don't believe that it is in the child's best interest to force it to see the non-custodial parent,\" he said.</p> <p>Japanese courts prefer to leave it to divorced couples to negotiate custody arrangements, Takase said. Officials say the government is looking at signing the Hague treaty, though not soon. </p> <p>\"We recognise that the convention is a useful tool to secure children's rights and we are seriously considering the possibility of signing the convention, but we've yet to reach a conclusion,\" said Yasuhisa Kawamura, a foreign ministry spokesman. </p> <p>\"We understand the anxieties of international parents, but there is no difference between the western approach and ours.\"</p> <p>Clarke's two custody hearings this week did not go well. An interpreter arranged by the foreign office failed to materialise. The British embassy in Tokyo provided him with a list of alternative interpreters but said it could offer no more help. </p> <p>The judge was forced to postpone his ruling, but Clarke is convinced he will never see his daughters again.</p> <p>\"We are talking about two British citizens, and no one will help me. The message our government is sending out to foreign nationals is that it's perfectly all right for them to commit a crime on British soil, and as long as they leave the country quickly enough, they'll get away scot-free.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The rise in the number of parental child abductions has been fuelled by a <strong>dramatic increase</strong> in marriages between Japanese and foreign nationals. According to the health and welfare ministry, there were 44,701 such marriages in 2006, compared with 7,261 in 1980, the vast majority between Japanese and <strong>Chinese, Koreans and Filipinos</strong>. An estimated 20,000 children are born to Japanese-foreign couples every year. Though Japan does not keep an official count, there are <strong>47 unresolved cases</strong> of US children being taken to Japan - only Mexico and India are more popular destinations - and 30 involving Canadian citizens. <strong>British officials are dealing with 10 cases</strong>, a foreign office spokeswoman told the Guardian, including that of Shane Clarke.</p>",
  "<p>F&amp;C Management, the UK's oldest investment trust, has teamed up with a group of US and Canadian fund managers to halt Wall Street financial regulators softening the rules on tar sands, arguing that new rules should take account of the carbon impact of reserves disclosed by oil and gas companies.</p> <p>The move reflects changing attitudes among mainstream investors to the impact of commercial activities that could worsen global warming and is aimed at discouraging the US securities &amp; exchange commission (SEC) from allowing energy firms to include carbon-heavy tar sands in their reserves submissions to the regulator.</p> <p>Elizabeth McGeveran, senior vice-president in F&amp;C's governance and sustainable investment team, said it was important for investors to be able to assess accurately the risk profile of reported reserves at a time when governments around the world were taking an increasingly hard line on carbon pollution.</p> <p>\"The energy consumption required to extract a barrel from Canadian tar sands is very different to a barrel of crude from the Gulf of Mexico. Understanding climate risk will assist investors in understanding and evaluating reserves,\" she said.</p> <p>\"SEC regulations already require the disclosure of known trends that companies can reasonably expect will have a material impact on net sales, revenues or income from continuing operations and we believe that the disclosure of any estimated additional risks posed by the extraction and development of additional reserves will be important,\" added McGeveran.</p> <p>The US regulator has been reviewing the regulations on the way reserves are calculated since 2004, when Shell fell foul of its rules and was forced to \"lose\" a quarter of its assets. The move led to fines, a plunging share price and the exit of its chairman, Sir Philip Watts.</p> <p>In June the SEC issued new proposals that would allow previously excluded resources such as oil sands to be \"classified\" as oil and gas reserves. They would also allow companies to disclose their \"probable\" and \"possible\" reserves as well as \"proved\" reserves, as at present.</p> <p>A host of other investors have signed a letter of concern about the tar sands proposals and called for carbon implications to be taken into account. These include the California Public Employees' Retirement System, Ceres and Parnassus Investments.</p> <p>The letter says investors are increasingly concerned about global warming, which is not only recognised as an economic and industrial priority but also as an issue of national security. </p> <p>It adds: \"Therefore, filers [of reserves] should be required to provide investors with information about the carbon content of proven, probable and potential oil reserves in their portfolio as well as the potential liabilities posed by their continued extraction and use.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 15 2008.

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> An Oxfordshire priory built on the site of a 13th-century hospital was not the most obvious place to celebrate Elisabeth Murdoch's 40th birthday. The picturesque village of Burford had no idea what hit it, as its hotels and B&amp;Bs struggled to accommodate guests including Rebekah Wade, James Harding, John Witherow, Will Lewis, Roger Alton and Simon Kelner plus, from the world of slightly newer media, Bebo's Joanna Shields. Peter Fincham and Alan Yentob were also there, as were Tony Blair, David Cameron, George Osborne and David Blunkett. Gordon Brown was otherwise engaged with someone almost as powerful as the Murdochs - the Queen. Brown missed a special 40th birthday edition of the Sun - presented by Wade - and the treat of having grace read by the priory's head Benedictine monk. Yes, really. But was Rupert Murdoch, also in attendance, among the late-night revellers who apparently made it until the wee small hours?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> So what will News of the World showbiz editor Rav Singh do next now that he has quit the News International paper after seven years? Singh is very close to Simon Cowell, so perhaps he could follow another celebrity-loving former News of the World man, Piers Morgan, into television. There's quite a turnover among those talent show judges these days, and Morgan will soon be fronting his own ITV chatshow. Singh is dating Morgan's ex-wife, Marion, so perhaps she could put in a word for him.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Daily Telegraph's online style guide includes a list of words that are banned from the paper, a list, it warns rather sternly, that is \"liable to grow\". Here are a few of Simon Heffer's, sorry, the Daily Telegraph's betes noires (doubtless banned as well), but not necessarily in the order that they are printed. \"The bubbly Europhobe boffin choked back tears as the frail grannies gunned down the nation's favourite iconic toff in a breathtaking tit-for-tat bloodbath in a toilet, sparking a jaw-dropping mass exodus by revellers, perverted Scout leaders, deep throats, copycat mystery callers and stunned mums to be who had just fallen pregnant on a rubbish budget airline. Home alone and fighting for his life, the disgraced crowd pleaser, who was set to come out, will greenlight a trademark hit series about the mammoth perfect storm and spark a huge probe about those legendary boardroom antics.\" No \"toffs\" in the Telegraph? Who'd have thought it?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Daily Mirror gleefully reported how Prince Harry had blown \u00a35,000 playing drinking games at London's Boujis night club with US rocker Cisco Adler in just two hours. The paper even ran a leader on the 3am page lead, declaring: \"No amount of fatuous spin from Clarence House or Buckingham Palace will hide the fact that he's at heart a Playboy Prince who knows the price of a cocktail if not the value of civilised behaviour.\" Except it was the paper that was doing a 180 degree spin in a rather shorter story the following day. \"The 23-year-old turned down the chance of a wild boozing match with hardcore rocker Cisco Adler at Boujis to get cosy with his stunning missus instead ... Looks like we caned it a little too hard ourselves.\" That's one way of putting it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Monkey's record dedication of the week goes to BBC 6Music's Liz Kershaw. \"I hope you are all right where you are. It seems like it's raining all over the world with 2 million people displaced in India, hundreds dying in the poorest country in the world Haiti, all the problems in the gulf of Mexico and Louisiana being evacuated and I have even got my buckets out at home. So this is for you if you are feeling a bit - literally - under the weather. It seems like Led Zeppelin predicted all this on the fourth album ...\" While some people might regard When The Levee Breaks as a not entirely appropriate tune at such a time, Alan Partridge would surely approve.</p>",
  "<p>I have enjoyed sport since I was a boy. I love football. I have followed England in every tournament since Mexico '86. I was there to see Maradona and his hand of God. I know what it means to love football and to love a club. I know how important it is to other people because football is so important to me.</p> <p>My life has been tied up with sport. It was the passion that I felt for sport that helped me to be successful with my business. That success allowed me to mix my passion and my business.</p> <p>I bought Newcastle United in May 2007. Newcastle attracted me because everyone in England knows that it has the best fans in football. When the fans are behind the club at St James' Park, it makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. It is magic.</p> <p>Newcastle's best asset has been, is and always will be the fans.<br>But like any business with assets the club has debts. I paid \u00a3134million out of my own pocket for the club. I then poured another \u00a3110million into the club not to pay off the debt, but just to reduce it.</p> <p>The club is still in debt. Even worse than that, the club still owes millions of pounds in transfer fees.</p> <p>I shall be paying out many more millions over the coming year to pay for players bought by the club before I arrived.</p> <p>But there was a double whammy. Commercial deals such as sponsorships and advertising had been front loaded.</p> <p>The money had been paid up front and spent. I was left with a club that owed millions and part of whose future had been mortgaged.</p> <p>Unless I had come into the club then it might not have survived. It could have shared the fate of other clubs who have borrowed too heavily against their future. Before I had spent a penny on wages or buying players Newcastle United had cost me more than a quarter of a billion pounds.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong. I did not buy Newcastle to make money. I bought Newcastle because I love football.</p> <p>Newcastle does not generate the income of a Manchester United or a Real Madrid. I am Mike Ashley, not Mike Ashley a multi-billionaire with unlimited resources. Newcastle United and I can't do what other clubs can. We can't afford it.</p> <p>I knew that the club would cost me money every year after I had bought it. I have backed the club with money.</p> <p>You can see that from the fact that Newcastle has the fifth highest wage bill in the Premier League.</p> <p>I was always prepared to bank roll Newcastle up to the tune of \u00a320million per year but no more. That was my bargain.</p> <p>I would make the club solvent. I would make it a going concern. I would pour up to \u00a320million a year into the club and not expect anything back.<br>It has to be realised that if I put \u00a3100million into the club year-in, year-out, then it would not be too long before I was cleaned out and a debt-ridden Newcastle United would find itself in the position that faced Leeds United.</p> <p>That is the nightmare for every fan. To love a club that over-extends itself, that tries to spend what it can't afford.</p> <p>That will never happen to Newcastle when I am in charge. The truth is that Newcastle could not sustain buying the Shevchenkos, Robinhos or the Berbatovs.</p> <p>These are recognised European footballers. They have played in the European leagues and everyone knows about them.</p> <p>They can be brilliant signings. But everybody knows that they are brilliant and so they, and players like them, cost more than \u00a330million to buy before you even take into account agent commissions and the multi-million pound wage deals.</p> <p>My plan and my strategy for Newcastle is different. It has to be.<br>Arsenal is the shining example in England of a sustainable business model. It takes time. It can't be done overnight.</p> <p>Newcastle has therefore set up an extensive scouting system. We look for young players, for players in foreign leagues who everyone does not know about. We try and stay ahead of the competition. We search high and low looking for value, for potential that we can bring on and for players who will allow Newcastle to compete at the very highest level but who don't cost the earth.</p> <p>I am prepared to back large signings for millions of pounds but for a player who is young and has their career in front of them and not for established players at the other end of their careers.</p> <p>There is no other workable way forward for Newcastle. It is in this regard that Dennis [Wise] and his team have done a first class job in scouting for talent to secure the future of the club.</p> <p>You only need to look at some of our signings to see that it is working, slowly working.</p> <p>Look at Jonas Guttierrez and Fabricio Collocini. These are world class players. The plan is showing dividends with the signing of exceptional young talent such as Sebastein Bassong, Danny Guthrie and Xisco.</p> <p>My investment in the club has extended to time, effort and yet again, money being poured into the Academy.</p> <p>I want Newcastle to be able to create its own legends of the future to rival those of the past. This is a long-term plan. A long-term plan for the future of the club so that it can flourish.</p> <p>One person alone can't manage a Premiership football club and scout the world looking for world class players and stars of the future. It needs a structure and it needs people who are dedicated to that task. It needs all members of the management team to share that vision for it to work.</p> <p>Also one of the reasons that the club was so in debt when I took over was due to transfer dealings caused by managers moving in and out of the club. Every time there was a change in manager, millions would be spent on new players and millions would be lost as players were sold. It can't keep on working like that. It is just madness.</p> <p>I have put Newcastle on a sound financial footing. It is reducing its debt. It is spending within itself. It is recruiting exciting new players and bringing in players for the future.</p> <p>The fans want this process to happen more quickly and they want huge amounts spent in the transfer market so that the club can compete at the top table of European football now.</p> <p>I am not stupid and have listened to the fans. I have really loved taking my kids to the games, being next to them and all the fans. But I am now a dad who can't take his kids to a football game on a Saturday because I am advised that we would be assaulted.</p> <p>Therefore, I am no longer prepared to subsidise Newcastle United. I am putting the club up for sale.</p> <p>I hope that the fans get what they want and that the next owner is someone who can lavish the amount of money on the club that the fans want.</p> <p>This will not be a fire sale. Newcastle is now in a much stronger position than it was in 2007. It is planning for the future and it is sustainable.</p> <p>I am still a fan of Newcastle United. We, my kids and I, have loved standing on the terraces with the fans, we have loved travelling with the away fans and we have met so many fans whose company we have enjoyed. We have absolutely loved it, but it is not safe any more for us as a family.</p> <p>I am very conscious of the responsibility that I bear in owning Newcastle United. Tough decisions have to be made in business and I will not shy away from doing what I consider to be in the best interests of the club. This is not fantasy football.</p> <p>I don't want anyone to read my words and think that any of this is an attack on Kevin Keegan. It is not.</p> <p>Kevin and I always got on. Everyone at the club, and I mean everyone, thinks that he has few equals in getting the best out of the players. He is a legend at the club and rightly so.</p> <p>Clearly there are disagreements between Kevin and the board and we have both put that in the hands of our lawyers.</p> <p>I hope that all the fans get to read this statement so that they understand what I am about. I would not expect all of the fans to agree with me. But I have set out, clearly, my plan. If I can't sell the club to someone who will give the fans what they want, then I shall continue to ensure that Newcastle is run on a business and football model that is sustainable.<br>I care too much about the club merely to abandon it.</p> <p>I have the interests of Newcastle United at heart. I have listened to you. You want me out. That is what I am now trying to do, but it won't happen overnight and it may not happen at all if a buyer does not come in.<br>You don't need to demonstrate against me again because I have got the message.</p> <p>Any further action will only have an adverse effect on the team. As fans of Newcastle United you need to spend your energy getting behind, not me, but the players who need your support.</p> <p>I am determined that Newcastle United is not only here today, but that it is also there tomorrow for your children who stand beside you at St James' Park.</p> <p>Mike Ashley.<br>Sunday 14th September 2008</p>",
  "<p>The drums thump like a heavyweight slugger punching a side of beef. The guitars riff in sharp, loin-stirring bursts. The vocals come from the strangulated but strangely powerful throat of a man gargling gravel. It can only be AC/DC: black black black! with the first single from their first new album in eight years, Black Ice. It's blues-metal heaviosity in exelcis. Not clever but, oh lordy, it's big.</p>",
  "<p>The declining months of the George W Bush presidency are becoming a long fugue of fear and suspicion: fear of enemies real and imagined, and suspicion freely given and taken between key regional allies, Pakistan, Israel, Turkey and the UK among them. The knack of annoying close allies is becoming one of the few consistent features of the fag end of this presidency. The latest ally, once deemed vital to the GWB \"war on terror\", to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/sep/11/georgebush.akistan&quot;\">thoroughly alienated</a> by Washington's unilateralism is Pakistan.<br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/12/usforeignpolicy.usa\">Authorising covert cross-border raids</a> by US special forces from Afghanistan into Pakistan, without informing the military and political command there, may seem like tactical boldness on the part of the American president. The US commanders say that they cannot trust the Pakistan military and the Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) agency. In the past, say the Americans, local Pakistan army and ISI officers have given warnings to Taliban leaders that the Americans on search and destroy raids on alleged Taliban and al-Qaida sanctuaries. <br> On September 3 a team of US Navy Seals <a href=\"http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/45374,opinion,taliban-attacks-show-us-doesnt-trust-pakistan\">was dropped by helicopter</a> in the area of Angoor Adda in South Waziristan, believed to be home turf of a senior Taliban, Jalalaluddibn Haqqani. It was followed by an air strike which killed two of Haqqani's wives, and some of his grandchildren. The Pakistan military said four young Taliban recruits had been killed and more than a dozen \"civilians\", women and children among them.<br> The raids were the first by US Special Operations Command since Bush signed a secret operational order in July authorising cross-border raids into Pakistan without prior notification to the authorities there. Interestingly, the first raid took place just as Asif Ali Zardari was about to be elected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/09/pakistan\">Pakistan's first civilian president for nine years</a>.<br> Whatever the tactical gains the American commanders think they are getting from such methods, they are likely to be outweighed by the strategic crassness of these escapades. Under current international law, they could be conceived as acts of aggression and a violation of the UN Charter. At a practical level, they stand to be a powerful recruiting sergeant for the Taliban \u2013 and the millions of hitherto uncommitted Afghan refugees in Pakistan.  The Pakistan army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, <a href=\"http://www.sindhtoday.net/pakistan/19942.htm\">said</a> there had been, now could there be, any secret agreement to allow US covert operations in northern Pakistan. He told US forces to keep out, and said the new civilian government needed \"to keep its distance\" from Washington. A regional divisional commander said his forces would oppose the Americans.<br> On the northern side of the Pakistan border, one must wonder how much the Americans informed their other allies about precisely what they're up to in their secret ops. Not much, if American attitudes to their European Nato allies elsewhere, Britain included, are anything to go by.  Contempt for the British is overt following what the Americans believe is the British defeat by Shiite militias in Basra. Their narrative now is that it took the Americans, plus nearly 30,000 troops of the Iraqi army, to restore order to the streets of Basra this spring, where the militias had been running amok.  To a certain extent, it is true that the Iraqi army, plus the Americans, plus belatedly some British forces, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/iraq.military\">have got the militias off the streets</a> in Iraq's southern oil capital through their Charge of the Knights offensive. But last year, when the British troops were bearing the brunt of the Shiite attacks, the Iraqi army was neither willing nor able to tackle the militias.<br> The triumphalist line of the Americans and the Iraqis having the skill and will to defeat finally the Mahdi army of Moqtada al-Sadr is already coming apart at the seams. A British intelligence analyst said this week, \"to claim the Sadrists have been smashed is nonsense. They are still a force.\" Worse, she said, the operation had driven Moqtada al-Sadr into the arms of Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran.  Hitherto, he had avoided getting too close to the regime in Teheran, in his aim to guarantee the independence of Iraq, and the Shiite community within it, from Iran. Once more, there are mutterings about the CIA mounting an operation to \"take out\" Sadr. It isn't only the Brits and the Pakistanis who fear that the American regime is misplaying, or overplaying, its hand. Two days before President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia ordered his troops onto the offensive in South Ossetia on August 7, the <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=9788\">Israeli military advisory team to the Georgians</a> quit Tbilisi. Israel has since suspended military assistance to Georgia, where it been involved in modernising the forces in partnership with the US military mission. <br> The most prominent Nato ally in the region, and the only one with a border with Georgia, Turkey, has appeared anxious, too, to distance itself from Washington. It has not been involved in the charge to press for Georgia and Ukraine to become members of Nato. Nor do many European Nato members want this to happen \u2013 not least because opinion polls suggest that the majority of the population in Ukraine don't want to join Nato. Meanwhile, the candidates in the US presidential race seem to be finding it hard to get their heads round the reduced circumstances of America's strategic place in the world compared with eight years ago, let alone tackle the growing divergence between the US and Europe, old and new. When Obama suggested on the stump that American forces might have to raid into Afghanistan unannounced, he was howled down. When asked in her ABC interview about the problems of border operations against Taliban/al-Qaida bases, Governor Sarah Palin <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/bulletin/bulletin_080912.htm\">seemed at a loss</a>.<br> This week, both the senior US commanders involved in Iraq and Afghan operations, Admiral Mike Mullen and General David Petraeus, have warned that the coalition is not winning in Afghanistan. Far from a winning tactic, they may find that their new plan of covert raids is a short route to self-defeat.</p>"
