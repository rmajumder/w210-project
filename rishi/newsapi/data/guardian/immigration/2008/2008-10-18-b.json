  "<h2>AC/DC<br>Black Ice (Columbia) \u00a312.99 </h2> <p>Their last album with 'black' in the title \u2013 the Eighties Back in Black \u2013 is arguably the best rock album ever, so AC/DC's 16th can't possibly measure up. But the fi rst record in eight years from the Australian perennials hugs the road masterfully. Opener 'Rock'n'Roll Train' establishes a railway-boogie equivalent of Germany's motorik rhythm. Its 14 successors are pithy rock haikus, whose swerves towards Led Zeppelin ('Rock'n'Roll Dream') and Bruce Springsteen ('Anything Goes') barely register as deviations. With four songs including the word 'rock' in the titles, AC/DC remain gloriously fit for purpose. <br><strong>Kitty Empire</strong> </p> <h2>Sugababes <br>Catfights and Spotlights (Island) \u00a312.99 </h2> <p>Still kicking around after five albums and two reshufles, Sugababes remain a slick operation but one almost entirely devoid of their old charisma and invention. In fact, their latest is so by-the-book, you suspect it may be the work of a pop industry supercomputer. Pseudo-feminist single 'Girls' should go down a storm at hen parties, although the fact it samples a tune last heard on a Boots ad speaks volumes. Elsewhere, there are rip-off s of the Supremes and the Jackson 5, a grandstanding ballad or three, oodles of synthetic sass, and nothing that merits a second listen. <br><strong>Hugh Montgomery</strong></p> <h2>Gang Gang Dance <br>Saint Dymphna (Warp) \u00a310.99 </h2> <p>Somewhere in Brooklyn exists a rare breed of local musician , neither boundary-pushing nor particularly cool. Gang Gang Dance are not they. Sucking on the same cosmic cheroot as MGMT and Yeasayer, though equally entranced by the scattershot rhythms of 'glitchtronica', they produce a wild-eyed racket to rival any of their better-known neighbours. 'First Communion' mangles art-punk with sunburst techno, the shoegaze of 'Vacuum' feeds into the electrogrime of 'Princes'. And though Lizzie Bougatsos' s vocals can slather superfl uous kookiness on arrangements that are plenty bonkers enough, this is still a glorious celebration of sonic excess. <br><strong>Ally Carnwath</strong></p> <h2>Bonnie 'Prince' Billy <br>Is it the Sea? (Domino) \u00a311.99 </h2> <p>Given Will Oldham's phenomenal output in the past 15 years, it's easy to feel ambivalent about the prospect of a live offering. Yet this is a showcase of entrancing reinvention. Recorded in Edinburgh in 2006, fi ddles, fl utes, accordions and close harmonies from Scottish folk outfi t Harem Scarem and drums and percussion from Alex Neilson rework Oldham's music with a Celtic twist. There is early Palace music, traditional ballad 'Molly Bawn' and a title track by Harem Scarem's Inge Thompson. Favourites 'Minor Place' and 'Love Comes To Me' are transformed; Oldham sings them with renewed lightness and energy. <br><strong>Katie Toms </strong></p> <h2>Nitin Sawhney <br>London Underground (Cooking Vinyl) \u00a311.99 </h2> <p>Sawhney's portrait of post 7/7 London is only partially successful in evoking the city's restless, contradictory moods. Much of the album has a wearied, contemplative character as vocalists 'watch dreams slip away' to a wistful melody or trudge through the 'same old same old' to menacing reggae. Of London's optimistic, vulgar bustle there's little sign. Paul McCartney's contribution urges us to 'climb every mountain' \u2013 sounds familiar! \u2013 but the most moving moments are from Catalan combo Ojos De Brujo and Indian guests, Anoushka Shankar among them. A concept too far. <br><strong>Neil Spencer</strong></p> <h2>Joe Stilgoe <br>I Like This One (Candid) \u00a313.99 </h2> <p>Songs at the piano don't get much sharper than this. Whether he's performing his own material or reshaping an old favourite, such as 'The Surrey With The Fringe On Top', Stilgoe always comes up with something new and arresting. With an astonishing piano technique and a voice that is clear and expressive without drawing attention to itself, he reveals an entertainingly diverse range of infl uences, among them Dudley Moore, Oscar Peterson, Flanders and Swann, and his own father, songwriter Richard Stilgoe. The Candid label, which unearthed Jamie Cullum, Stacey Kent and Claire Teal, could well have done it again. <br><strong>Dave Gelly</strong></p>",

Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Police in the United States are desperately searching for a six-year-old boy after he was taken from his home at gunpoint four days ago by three men posing as police. It is feared that the boy could be a pawn in the border drug war that has cost 3,700 lives this year alone and that he may have been abducted by a Mexican gang.</p> <p>Cole Puffinburger was taken early last Wednesday after three armed men, described as Hispanic, went into the house in Las Vegas and demanded money. They then tied up Cole's mother and left with the boy. </p> <p>Police believe he may have been taken because his grandfather, Clemens Fred Tinnemeyer, 51, owed Latino methamphetamine dealers between $8m and $20m (\u00a34.6m-\u00a311.6m). Last night Tinnemeyer was in custody being questioned by police; he is a legal bankrupt and was believed to be travelling in a beige-and-gold Winnebago motor trailer when he was arrested yesterday in Riverside over the Nevada-California border.</p> <p>Las Vegas police captain Vincent Cannito said the case involved significant amounts of money and drugs and that there was a definite link between the family and drug deals. Law enforcement agencies said they were searching several locations in north east Las Vegas, and that, having arrested a second man, they were now looking for a third, Jesus Gasterone. </p> <p>'The investigation has taken different aspects some of which involve family members, some friends of the family. There's a strong network within a very close proximity,' Cannito said. Investigators had issued an 'amber alert' for the missing boy to police departments on routes from Las Vegas to Mexico but withdrew it yesterday, saying its effectiveness had run its course.</p> <p>According to early reports, Tinnemeyer has worked as a carpenter for more than two decades. He has not been in contact with his family since May and was reported missing last month.</p> <p>The abduction happened when three men knocked on the door of the house where Cole Puffinburger lived. After tying up his mother and her boyfriend, they ransacked the house and then took Cole. Last night the boy's father appealed for his son's release. 'It is beyond me why anyone would do something so cruel to anyone, let alone a little boy,' said Robert Puffinburger, a civil engineer. 'All I want is for them to bring him home. I don't care about the rest of it. Just let him go somewhere. Drop him off. I don't care. Just keep him safe.'</p> <p>The Mexican-run drug trade uses transport corridors though New Mexico and Arizona to Las Vegas, and then on to markets in the Midwest and beyond. Investigators said traffickers usually seized cars and other assets to recoup money. But they also fear Cole's abduction is a sign that the grotesque violence that characterises the battle for control of Mexico's drug trade could be seeping across the border into the US.</p> <p>An attempted crackdown by authorities since August appears to have triggered a dramatic escalation in violence, with 387 people killed in the first two weeks of October and gangs resorting to torture and beheadings. Even women and children are targets in the daily ritual of revenge killings.</p> <p>According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the border turf war is primarily between the Tijuana-based cartel of the Arellano F\u00e9lix brothers, the Ju\u00e1rez cartel, based across Chihuahua state and led by the Carrillo Fuentes family, and the Sinaloa gang, led by Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n.</p> <p>'The pressure [from the authorities] that's being put upon drug cartels in Mexico has caused an escalation in violence,' said DEA spokeswoman Sarah Pullen last week. 'It's horrific. If you look at what's happened with many of the beheadings down there, the killings are definitely to send a message.'</p> <p>On Friday, President George W Bush's top drug enforcement officer, John Walters, warned that Mexico's cartels were now entering the US to make their attacks. 'They come across and kidnap, murder and carry out assassinations,' he said. 'They do not respect the border.'</p> <p>Walters sent a direct message to the traffickers: 'They have a choice: come in and face justice, or die.'</p> <p>In one incident last week six people were lined up against a wall and shot in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, directly across the border from El Paso, Texas. The assassins fired more than 100 bullets and left a note warning: 'Message for all rats, this will continue.'</p> <p>One of the victims blamed a drug cartel for the killings before he died, saying he had been accused by his murderers of selling drugs for a rival gang. </p> <p>The abduction has left the Las Vegas neighbourhood of Cherry Grove Avenue fearful. The victim's next-door neighbour, Guadaloupe Negrete, said parents in the area were anxious. </p> <p>Cole Puffinburger has now become an unwitting trophy in an escalating war.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of Christians in the Indian state of Orissa have been forced to renounce their religion and become Hindus after lynch mobs issued them with a stark ultimatum: convert or die.</p> <p>The wave of forced conversions marks a dramatic escalation in a two-month orgy of sectarian violence which has left at least 59 people dead, 50,000 homeless and thousands of houses and churches burnt to the ground. As neighbour has turned on neighbour, thousands more Christians have sought sanctuary in refugee camps, unable to return to the wreckage of their homes unless they, too, agree to abandon their faith.</p> <p>Last week, in the worst-affected Kandhamal district, The Observer encountered compelling evidence of the scale of the violence employed in a conversion programme apparently sanctioned by members of one of the most powerful Hindu groups in India, the 6.8-million member Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) - the World Hindu Council.</p> <p>Standing in the ashes of her neighbour's house in the village of Sarangagada, Jaspina Naik, 32, spoke nervously, glancing towards a group of Hindu men watching her suspiciously. 'My neighbours said, \"If you go on being Christians, we will burn your houses and your children in front of you, so make up your minds quickly\",' she said. 'I was scared. Christians have no place in this area now.'</p> <p>On her forehead, she wore a gash of vermilion denoting a married Hindu woman, placed there by the priest at the conversion ceremony she had been obliged to attend a day earlier, along with her husband and three young children. 'I'm totally broken,' she said. 'I have always been a Christian. Inside I am still praying for Jesus to give me peace and to take me out of this situation.'</p> <p>She and her neighbour, Kumari Naik, 35, gazed forlornly at the charred remains of the house. The mob that arrived one evening in the first week of the violence, armed with swords and axes, had looted what they wanted before dousing the building with petrol and setting it alight. Kumari had fled into the nearby forest with her husband, Umesh, and 14-year-old son Santosh. A smoke-damaged child's drawing of Mickey Mouse pinned to one wall was all that remained of their former lives. Shattered roof tiles crunched underfoot as the women moved through the blackened rooms. </p> <p>The priest had given them cow dung to eat during the ceremony, they said, telling them it would purify them. 'We were doing that, but we were crying,' Jaspina said. </p> <p>The roads between the villages are rough and potholed, adding to the difficulties in accessing what is already a remote region, a six-hour drive from the state capital, Bhubaneshwar. The remoteness has undoubtedly played a part in the continuation of the violence, making it harder for police to move about quickly, even if they were minded to do so. Christian leaders, though, have accused the authorities of dragging their feet, claiming they are reluctant to antagonise the majority Hindu community in the run-up to parliamentary elections next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338756300\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/18/hindu-rampage-220x300.jpg\" alt=\"Sumani Naik\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sumani Naik, 18, stands beneath a torn Christian poster in her fire-damaged house in Kandhamal district after being forced to convert. Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Relations between the Hindu and Christian communities were already at a low ebb when the killing of VHP leader Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati on 23 August provided the trigger for the current wave of violence. The VHP blamed Christians and the mobs descended on the homes of neighbours and friends. Those who were too slow to get away were killed. Amid the savagery, two incidents stood out: a young Hindu woman working in a Christian orphanage was burnt alive and a nun was gang-raped.</p> <p>Yet the VHP is unrepentant and appears to be involved, at least at grassroots level, with the campaign of forced conversions. One priest who converted 18 Christians in the village of Sankarakhole last week told The Observer that he had been approached by local VHP representatives to carry out the ceremony.</p> <p>'The VHP people came with letters that said they wanted to be converted, so I converted them,' said Preti Singh Patra, who is the brother of a senior VHP official. Crouching on the ground in front of his temple, set in a small walled garden beneath a huge banyan tree, he ran through the details of the ceremony: first some fruit to eat, followed by a mixture of cow dung and urine mixed with milk and curd, a dip in water from the Ganges, an hour of prayers and then the painting of a bindi on the forehead.</p> <p>Some local men stepped forward to speak to him. 'Don't say too much,' they warned. The priest seemed unconcerned. The 18 had been the only Christians in the village, he said. They were happy to convert.</p> <p>Around the village, the countryside is a sea of green, a beautiful lush vista that offers, at a distance, no clues to the turmoil. Yet up close it is a landscape scarred by the ugly remains of homes and churches which lie shattered between other houses still inhabited and unscathed, those belonging to Kandhamal's Hindus. </p> <p>A few miles down the road from Sankarakhole, in the village of Minia, Sujata Digal, 38, stood outside her own burnt-out home. The mob had arrived at 3am, she said. She and her husband Hari hid in the forest and watched the house burn. When they came out of the forest, the mob returned and told them to convert, and it was not a hard decision.</p> <p> 'They said, 'If you don't become Hindu, we'll burn your houses too and start killing you',' said Ashish Digal, the former Christian pastor. 'I've been forced to convert. Everyone is being converted. They beat us in the fields. I went to the temple. We had to say that we belonged to the Hindu state of Orissa, and that from this day we are Hindus.'</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338756301\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/18/Orissa-police-460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Orissa police\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> Soldiers guarding Christian refugees at a camp in Kandamal district. Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gethin Chamberlain/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the violence started, Christians outnumbered Hindus in Minia: now 115 have converted, roughly half of their original number. The rest have fled. </p> <p>Burn your Bibles, the men told Ashish Digal. He told them he had, but hid them instead. Every couple of days people come to his house to search, hoping to catch him out. Those people are not strangers; they are his neighbours.</p> <p>They had been sitting idly in the main road when The Observer's car pulled up. Now the young driver, Sudhir, was rushing down the path that led to what remained of Sujata Digal's house, holding his head, visibly shaken. 'We must leave now,' he said. </p> <p>He had been standing by the car when the men closed in around him. They left the talking to Prashant Digal, a teacher and organiser for the local VHP youth wing. 'Why did you bring these people here?', he demanded, punching Sudhir in the head. 'Take the vehicle and go. Leave them here for us.' They surrounded him, a young Hindu, and slapped him around again. No one came to his aid. 'If you stay, we will burn you with them in the car. You will all be killed. Just leave them,' they told him. But he did not, which was a decent thing for a frightened boy to do. He drove a little way down the road and parked around a corner, out of sight, and came back to raise the alarm.</p> <p>Back on the main road, the men were waiting. 'Put your notebook and your cameras away. You will take no pictures and record nothing,' the VHP man said. 'You want to know what is happening? Now I will tell you why this is happening.' He blamed the Christians for taking the jobs of Hindus, for the murder of the Swami. The only solution was for Christians to convert, he said. 'This is a Hindu community. Everyone can stay here, as long as they are part of that community. And now you should go.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>Why?</strong></p> <p>In a city rammed to the gills with fancy hotels, the Connaught is perhaps the fanciest of them all. It's certainly the most expensive (suites regularly hit a grand a night), the most recently refurbished (it has enjoyed/endured a multi-squillion-pound, year-long makeover), and the most butler-y (a corps of 15 fully trained old-style butlers service the hotel's guests, with a further 10 expected to be hired by next spring). For these and multiple other reasons (expanses of marble floor, stunning ceiling roses, stupendously sweet liveried doormen, the smell of money, the sense that no corner has been cut, anywhere, anyhow), the Connaught is pure, unadulterated luxury. Anna Wintour insists on staying there, any time she's in town. Unsurprisingly, it's got a killer bar. Actually - it's got two killer bars, the Coburg, which is tasteful and discreet and not at all my style, and the Connaught Bar, which is a sparkly, art-deco jewel box of an extravaganza, and therefore very much my style. </p> <p><strong>Are you even a tiny bit aware that we're mired in the advanced stages of a recession, and that it's contrary to prevailing sensitivities to go boozing in v expensive venues?</strong></p> <p>I am very aware of the credit crunch as it happens. I've swapped my customary champagne baths for cava ones, and even considered DIY-ing my manicures! (I know!) However, I think that this is precisely the time one needs to indulge in decadent drink-ups - less frequent, higher quality. This sort of thing will make you much jollier, and give you an easier, less moody, hangover, because the alcohol's better. </p> <p><strong>It scares me when your logic begins to seem sensible.</strong></p> <p>Just go with it! So, the Connaught Bar's been closed, along with the rest of the hotel, for this lengthy and costly makeover; its reopening coincided almost exactly with the Cocktail Girl's birthday. Clearly it would have been plain rude to celebrate the ebbing away of one's youth anywhere else. So off I popped. </p> <p><strong>And?</strong></p> <p>Well my dear, it was immense fun. I secured myself a banquette in the forward section of the bar, so I could check out the barmen as they worked (such vigorous shaking!). I was struck by the waitresses' excellent grey tailored frocks. (I made several attempts to buy one but was told, firmly, that they were a perk of the job and not for general consumption.) I was presented with a cocktail menu, a bowl of the bar's signature caramelised pecans (yum!) and a mini-drink, designed to amuse my bouche while I was choosing my main-course cocktail. </p> <p><strong>Which was?</strong></p> <p>A Mayfair Delight, a dryish, cucumber-tinted variant of a champagne cocktail, which was very good indeed. While I was sipping away at it in a most contented fashion, I spotted Santino Cicciari, overlord of the international cocktail-making scene, and creative head of operations at the Connaught Bar. He came over to say hello, and show me his special balls!</p> <p><strong>Dear God.</strong></p> <p>Which are made from ice. A special kind of ice, designed to melt very, very slowly, in the interest of not diluting one's drink too quickly. They're a thing of great beauty, let me tell you, are Santino's ice balls. Just when I thought things could not possibly get any ritzier (or should that be: Connaught-ier?) I was served a selection of bar snacks, designed by the hotel's award-winning chef H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze; and they were stunningly good. (Squid and chorizo and sun-dried tomato skewer, anyone? Hell, yes!) </p> <p>So there you go. The Connaught. My new favourite hotel bar and no mistake. It's in its first flush of post-refurb lushness right now, chaps; so do yourselves a favour and go soon. Kisses. CG. </p> <p>\u2022 The Connaught Bar, Carlos Place, London W1, 020 7499 7070</p>",
  "<h2>Best ski company: Inntravel</h2> <p>For a mountaineer accustomed to toiling laboriously uphill, skiing is the great escape. I love the effortless ease of it all, the speed, the instant adrenaline rush, the pure hedonism. I enjoy big, steep, hard slopes. But at times the braying crowds and the sheer industrial scale of the big glitzy resorts do pall, inducing a nostalgia for the kind of intimate skiing I grew up with in the 1960s. Then, we stayed in a remote chalet, collecting milk from the farm nearby and driving each day past snow-laden pines to a tiny resort with just two ski lifts, where we were the only English speakers. It was in a Proustian search for that kind of idealised childhood memory that I set off last March to spend four days in the Styrian village of Ramsau in Austria.</p> <p>The search got off to a good start at the family-run Hotel Matschner, which was reassuringly unstuffy and gem\u00fctlich. I once asked a German friend to explain this untranslatable concept and he said: 'Imagine a hut in the mountains. It's snowing outside, but inside there is a cosy fug and people are sitting around drinking coffee or beer - but not getting drunk: chatting in a relaxed, unthreatening way, or perhaps playing cards.' That unhurried ease pervaded Ramsau, which sits at 1,100 metres on a wooded plateau above the Enns Valley. There is a cable car up the famous massif of the Dachstein, immediately behind the village, and a comprehensive downhill network at Schladming, on the far side of the valley; but Ramsau itself concentrates on langlauf - cross-country.</p> <p>I had always been rather scathing about skiing on the flat. Now, however, arriving fresh from England, with a langlauf track right outside the hotel, I decided to shrug off prejudice and give it a go. I even booked an hour's lesson with Krystel from Finland, who talked me through the basic gliding stride and herring-bone climb and said I was doing very well. For an English person.</p> <p>Then I was off, gliding alone through the twilight, with a pungent hint of cow dung wafting from farmhouses and the lichen gleaming jade on the gnarled sycamores. The warm f\u00f6hn wind was blowing from the south and rain began to fall from a yellow sky, sending me scurrying back to the hotel; but overnight the rain turned to snow and in the morning I set off again, a zealous langlauf convert.</p> <p>There were several loipen (prepared twin-groove tracks) to choose from and I decided on the Kulmbergloipe - a medium-grade route circling 14km around the forested hill which dominates the village. It was like going for a cross-country run, except enjoyable. Even exhilarating. And how liberating to replace clodhopping plastic boots with delicate shimmying slippers and featherlight skis, gliding through a silent landscape. </p> <p>For lunch I tried one of the village restaurants, guessing - in the absence of an English translation - that the grated golden kren with my Steirische W\u00fcrzelfleisch was cheese, only to choke on what turned out to be a mouthful of neat horseradish. Weisbeer soothed my burning throat and after lunch I returned to the langlauf centre for another lesson with Krystel. This time I tried skating. Done by experts, it is an incredibly powerful, efficient, elegant way of travelling across snow. Attempted by me, it was an exhausting struggle, particularly as I was using the fish-scale gripping skis designed for klassisch langlauf, not the smooth-soled skating models.</p> <p>I finished the day with another glide round the traditional Kulmbergloipe, stopping half way to drink gl\u00fchwein in a farmhouse smelling of old pine, leather and the milking parlour, redolent of those childhood Swiss holidays. Later, in the gloaming, I missed a signpost and ended up thrashing through the forest, but eventually I picked up a path back to Ramsau. Having clocked up over 30km that day, it was wonderful to soak my stiff limbs in the luxurious hotel sauna.</p> <p>The weather was abysmal in the morning. A keener langlauf convert might have persisted in trying to master the elusive skating stride. I returned to my roots and went downhill skiing at Schladming, seeing nothing through the driving snow. However, on my final day the whole of Austria was blessed with a sunny reprieve. The mountains glittered under a coat of fresh powder and at last I got my first sight of the Dachstein, with its famous South Face - a huge limestone precipice first climbed by the Steiner brothers in 1909. Rumour has it that five years after that historic ascent, when Georg Steiner was sent to fight in the First World War, he came back on leave to Ramsau complaining: 'It's horrible - there are men actually killing each other.' He spent the rest of the war hiding in the wild, remote country just north of the Dachstein.</p> <p>Nowadays, sightseers and ski addicts can get up the Dachstein in a cable car. When snow conditions are safe there is an exciting 'freeride' off-piste run back down to Ramsau called the Edelgries. For serious langlaufers there is a loipe on the glacial plateau close to the summit. It wasn't open when I was there, but I saw aerial pictures of the 30km track in summer, white snow banked up on the grey ice in elaborate geometric patterns worthy of Andy Goldsworthy, with hundreds of earnest athletes toiling back and forth. </p> <p>Myself, I was content just to admire the Dachstein from across the valley while enjoying a final blast round the interconnected pistes of the Schladming network. For all my nostalgia for 1960s low-tech simplicity, I have to admit that it was a treat to whizz so seamlessly from piste to piste. Apart from one themed chairlift sporting folksy music and giant cartoon animals popping up out of the trees - kitsch on a truly Disneyian scale - it was all charmingly peaceful. Few of the runs broke above tree level and the mountains all around were on a modest, domestic scale. </p> <p>Perhaps, after the awesome grandeur of Chamonix or Zermatt, it was a bit tame, and the scarcity of black runs might disappoint some; but I warmed to the good-natured, uncrowded feel of the place, even on a fine Saturday - so different from the jostling self-regard of the big resorts. I liked, too, the combination of downhill and langlauf and thought what a good holiday it would make for young children. And also for grandparents, who might have tired of the planks but could be tempted by a gentle snowshoe walk along a prepared trail through the trees. </p> <p>I had to leave that Saturday afternoon to meet friends in Innsbruck, but I thought Ramsau and the surrounding area perfect for a week's escape. As for longer trips, gazing out across range after range of Austrian mountains that I have still not explored, I longed to return equipped with touring skis and skins, knowing that there would be scope for several lifetimes of adventure, crossing pass after pass and staying overnight in those well-appointed gem\u00fctlich mountain huts.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen made his name as the first Briton to climb Everest without bottled oxygen.

  "<p>The slide in life company shares, including those of the Prudential and Aviva, has led some people to ask whether insurers might be the new banks. </p> <p>It's a horrible thought for millions of policyholders, and for small investors who received free shares when the likes of Norwich Union, Friends Provident and Standard Life floated on the stock market, but the answer is: well, not exactly.</p> <p>Banks can be brought down very quickly indeed if there is a run on funds by depositors. Life insurers, however, don't do instant access savings or current accounts - they specialise in long-term products such as pensions and endowments, so policyholders can't turn up on the doorstep and demand their money back in quite the same way. Unlike banks, insurers can apply a penalty, known as a 'market value adjustment', to policyholders who pull out their money before its term is up, and that helps companies to manage the impact of an outflow of funds on their capital.</p> <p>There is also a more robust protection scheme in place for large insurance policies and pension funds than for big bank deposits; 100 per cent of the first \u00a32,000 is guaranteed, and 90 per cent of anything above that. </p> <p>Having said that, there is no denying that their capital is under strain. The regulators insist that insurers hold pools of assets big enough to enable them to fulfil their obligations to policyholders, plus some layers of cushioning on top to give a margin of safety. These assets are a mix of shares, corporate bonds and property, all of which have taken a big hit in the credit crunch.</p> <p>To add to the gloom, the insurers have been infected by the banking disaster. They are major holders of bank shares, so are nursing large losses and are likely to lose out on dividend income under the terms of the government bail-out. Insurers have also invested heavily in bank debt, so any moves by the government to hit bondholders would be very painful for them. </p> <p>Worries about the sector have taken hold in Europe, with shares in ING diving on concerns over its capital. Anglo-South African group Old Mutual tanked because of fears over losses in the US. The UK's major operators insist they are in a strong position, but some may have to cut dividends, close their doors to new business, or try to raise cash from shareholders through rights issues. Aviva has gone on record to say that it has no need for a rights issue to support its regulatory capital, and that it has no plans to cut its dividend. It admits, though, that it is looking again at its plans to share out surplus assets from its 'orphan' estate - policyholders will probably get less. </p> <p>The Pru denies rumours it is about to launch a rescue rights issue, although chief executive Mark Tucker might want to raise money to buy some Asian business from stricken US giant AIG. Its new business figures on Tuesday are likely to show good sales growth, but its surplus capital will have shrunk. Extrapolating from figures released by Legal &amp; General, which saw \u00a3500m sliced off its capital cushion, the Pru's buffer is likely to shrink by around \u00a3150-\u00a3200m to somewhere in the region of \u00a31.25bn. </p> <p>The UK big three say they can withstand substantial further falls in stock markets, and that they have only limited exposure to the high-risk derivatives that have brought down AIG in the US and Yamato Life in Japan. </p> <p>The big question is whether we should believe the assurances. The banks issued similar soothing statements about their financial strength as well as, in the case of Royal Bank of Scotland and Bradford &amp; Bingley, denials that they would launch rights issues - and we all know what happened to them.</p> <p>Insurers have some bad form of their own: Equitable Life kept saying it was just dandy right up to the brink of its collapse and Standard Life stonewalled queries about its solvency in the period before its weakened capital forced it to shed its mutual status. And let's not forget that the Pru lost former chief executive Jonathan Bloomer after he first denied he was going to launch a rights issue, and then did so anyway. </p> <p>The regulators, whose role in the Equitable Life scandal was severely criticised in the Penrose report, have had the chance to learn from some of their earlier mistakes in the sector; we must hope against hope that they have done so. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority does seem to have benefited from the experience of steering the life insurers through the difficult aftermath of 9/11, when their solvency came under severe pressure. This time companies will not be forced into a downward spiral by being compelled to sell shares into a falling market to meet regulatory requirements. </p> <p>Even supposing we give the big insurers the benefit of the doubt, there are still difficulties ahead for newer, smaller players such as Paternoster, a pensions buyout specialist run by former Axa and Pru executive Mark 'Chopper' Wood. The buyout business - taking final salary schemes off the hands of their parent companies and trying to run them for a profit - was until recently viewed as a grand new money-earner. But deals have become much harder to do. Wood reckons he doesn't need new capital, but in any event he might find his backers, including Deutsche Bank, less willing - or able - to pour in new money. At the least, his hopes for a float will be on ice. Other players in the controversial buyout market are also likely to find deals dry up.</p> <p>Stock markets are in a state of panic at the moment - share prices are conducting less of a random walk and more of a wild, drunken stagger. The shudders going through the insurance sector might be unfounded or overdone. But it would take a very trusting soul to bank on it.</p> <h2>Good news for a different type of insurance</h2> <p>Share prices are plunging, but libidos have gone in the opposite direction, according to Garry Watts, chief executive of SSL, which sells Durex Condoms. SSL's half-yearly sales rose 22 per cent to \u00a3320m, and its shares, though down over the year, have outperformed the FTSE 100 as couples too afraid to watch Robert Peston on the telly opted for an early night. 'People are still looking to have fun, judging by sales of Durex Play products, which help people have better sex - and our condoms like Performa, which slow the man down. By which time the news will have ended, hopefully,' says a chipper Mr Watts.</p>",
  "<p>Ivan, a thick-set Serbian ex-military policeman who now works as a bodyguard for foreign companies in northern Iraq, has a good sense of humour. He jokes that the country is 'boring' now. Before commercial flights to the country started after the 2003 war, he and his twin brother Stojan used to ferry European businessmen in heavily armed convoys across the mountainous and largely lawless border from Turkey into Iraq. 'That was fun,' he smiled wistfully. But though security in Iraq has since improved, for Westerners it is still one of the most dangerous places on earth. 'Last week I had to eliminate someone,' he explains, without going into detail. The foreign businessmen who have just stepped off the plane at Erbil airport in the north of the country decide against pressing him further. He hands his new charges body armour and then they join their round-the-clock heavily armed security detail. It's a unique welcome, Iraq-style. </p> <p>On Monday, in more serene surroundings at the Sheraton Park Lane opposite Buckingham Palace in London, Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq's oil minister, met executives from Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total and dozens of other foreign oil companies. On the table were eight contracts to develop Iraq's eight largest oil fields, which Baghdad hopes will almost double the country's production to 4.5 million barrels of oil per day (bpd). Last month, Shell agreed to invest up to $4bn to form a joint venture to produce gas in the south. It has also become the first oil major to open a permanent office in Baghdad, though most foreign oil executives remain reluctant to visit the capital because of safety fears, despite pressure from the Iraqi oil ministry to attend meetings there. Five years after the US-led invasion of the country, the long-awaited - and controversial - foreign-led development of Iraq's vast oil resources looks set to begin in earnest. </p> <p>But as security improves and Baghdad starts to draw up contracts, many questions remain, says Samuel Ciszuk of Global Insight. Addax Petroleum, a Swiss oil company, is one of a handful of small foreign firms already operating in Iraq. Managers at its huge Taq Taq field near Erbil know from experience that Iraq is not an easy place to do business. There has been no production at the field since July because the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which governs the semi-autonomous region, has not extended the company's licence. </p> <p>More importantly, the longer-term plans of Addax and its Turkish partner, Genel Enerji, to increase production at the site to 150,000 bpd are clouded in uncertainty. No pipeline runs from the field, so trucks have to carry the oil, selling it to the local market, usually at a discount to going rates. Addax says that only a maximum of 60,000 bpd can be moved this way. But no construction work on a pipeline has begun because Baghdad has banned the KRG from exporting oil from the region. The ban will only be lifted once the long-awaited national oil legislation - which will set out who controls the oil and how to exploit it - is passed. The problem is, Baghdad and the KRG have been locked in stalemate over the new law for the past two years, and no one knows when it may get signed.</p> <p>Herish Muharam Muhamad, chairman of the regional board of investment, was adamant when he spoke to The Observer that the KRG should have control over the region's oil. 'When we talk about oil and natural resources, we are talking about our constitutional rights,' he said. 'If our friends in the rest of Iraq think we should not be doing this, it's not our problem.' The continuing stand-off leaves companies like Addax in limbo. </p> <p>The oil majors are also anxiously watching the tortuous negotiations, which continued last week. The eight contracts outlined in London on Monday offer attractive terms, but the worry is that the new oil legislation - whenever it is passed - could change the terms retrospectively. </p> <p>Despite the problems, Iraq remains hugely attractive. It holds an estimated 112 billion barrels of reserves, the second largest in the world. Much of the country remains unexplored and production costs are among the lowest in the world. With resource nationalism limiting the opportunities for oil majors to boost their production, Iraq is a valuable prize. </p> <p>But foreign oil companies have to tread warily in a country often suspicious of their motives. Baghdad has refused to offer production-sharing agreements - preferred by companies as they allow them to book a share of a country's reserves - because Iraq wants to retain sovereignty over its oil. John McKeon, a former director of Circle Oil who knows Iraq well, says: 'The Iraqis are suspicious of the foreign companies and who is behind them. They want to get a good deal for the nation.'</p> <p>When Addax executives visited Shiwashok, a dusty village of primitive huts near its Taq Taq field, Mr Sadi, a village elder, told company executives about the severe summer drought and asked for more water supplies from the company. They promised to oblige. In a complicated country, Addax - like all foreign oil companies in Iraq - knows it needs support with the KRG, Baghdad and among ordinary Iraqis for its gamble to pay off.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is losing its allure for migrant workers, as the weakening jobs market persuades eastern Europeans to look elsewhere for a better life, according to new analysis by think-tank the Institute for Public Policy Research.</p> <p>Immigration Minister Phil Woolas has warned that immigration may be cut as unemployment rises, but it seems the influx has already slowed. </p> <p>Official figures show that the number of new arrivals from eastern Europe was 16 per cent lower in the first three months of this year, than the same period in 2007. Applications for National Insurance numbers from foreign workers dropped by a quarter.</p> <p>Advocates of open borders have long argued that foreign workers would go home if the labour market turned sour. With unemployment now rising at the fastest pace since the early Nineties, many appear to be seeking opportunities in other countries.</p> <p>Danny Sriskandarajah, IPPR's deputy director, said the news was early evidence of a shift in Britain's status as a magnet for migrant workers.</p> <p>'This data demonstrates that immigration is self-regulating - migrants move to be able to work and if jobs are not available, or not better than at home, they simply will not come or stay.'</p> <p>During the boom of the past decade, economists believe migrants helped to keep a lid on inflation, by filling key gaps in the labour market and preventing wages from surging. </p> <p>With a recession looming, some hope they could provide a safety valve in a different way, by leaving the country, instead of lengthening dole queues.</p>",
  "<p>Recessions destroy ideologies as fast as they destroy jobs. Until six months ago, sensible men and women could suppose that Scotland might prosper as an independent country, that Labour's light-touch regulation of the City benefited the whole nation and that Gordon Brown had abolished the business cycle. All busted flushes now, as worthless as Bradford &amp; Bingley's shares.</p> <p>At the Cheltenham Literature Festival the Times organised debates on 'political correctness'. The respectable, liberal-minded audience was determined to see that once fashionable idea dumped into the dustbin of history as well.</p> <p>As I listened to their denunciations, I tried to understand what they meant by 'political correctness'. It has been so tarnished by overuse that the phrase long ago lost any value, and it would be better to drop it. I could see that the financial collapse had not turned them into bigots. They did not want to chain women to the kitchen sink, impose colour bars or recriminalise homosexuality. On the contrary, they were strongly against sexism, racism and homophobia. Rather, they were objecting to the government's Balkanisation of Britain; the constant harping on colour and creed by the public sector and large parts of the voluntary sector whose bureaucrats seem determined to separate the British by race and religion and treat them as if they were alien species.</p> <p>There is little liberal about the identity politics which follows. Indeed, many of the unelected community leaders the bureaucracy and charities pander to are sexist, racist and homophobic - and, on occasion, unashamed clerical fascists. The protesting audience would have been more accurate if it had condemned the 'communalism' of the state, which fosters division, and the 'reactionary chic' of the wider intelligentsia which allows insipid academics and broadcasters to bring vicarious thrills to their lives by indulging the violence of religious fanatics.</p> <p>In the bubble years, the folly of cultural relativism was clear to all those who were not blinded by its dogmas. Liberal values could not flourish in a society in which Labour ministers found it acceptable for a young Sikh woman to have her play forced off stage because it offended old Sikh men, or newspapers argued that it was reasonable for mass murderers to bomb the London tube because they disagreed with Tony Blair's foreign policy. Even before the slump, electors were abandoning old loyalties and voting on communalist lines. Hardly anyone noticed, but in the London mayoral election, Ken Livingstone won the support of all the ethnic minorities except, for obvious reasons, the Jews. He still lost, because white working-class voters came out against a Labour candidate who seemed to have no interest in their lives.</p> <p>Now the recession is on us, communalist politics could turn far nastier. Britain ought to be able to offer common compassion to the swelling ranks of the unemployed and struggling households. To use old-fashioned language, they will need a class-based politics which regards the relief of poverty and enforced idleness as national priorities.</p> <p>But the bureaucracy barely talks about class, while the Labour government cannot see what is wrong with Harriet Harman's euphemistic plan to 'positively discriminate' against white men. We have bureaucrats who fund support groups for the black unemployed or Hindu unemployed but never for all the unemployed. We have a government which thinks it progressive to tell employers that they can favour the privately educated daughter of an Indian steel tycoon over the state-educated son of a council estate single mother.</p> <p>As the hard times start to bite, the obsession with identity politics will certainly lead to communal groups competing for scarce resources and shouting 'racist' every time a grant application is rejected. Jon Cruddas, the left-wing Labour MP, is already fighting the white backlash in his Dagenham constituency. He told me he despaired of an officialdom that unthinkingly played the BNP's game by seeing 'everything through the prism of race'. Did it really not guess that working-class voters would reclassify themselves as 'whites' and join the identity game?</p> <p>Alert ministers are aware of the danger. Phil Woolas understands that mass immigration and recessions are a poisonous combination. Meanwhile the Home Office accepts that the scramble for money by interest groups emphasising racial and religious grievance may be the least of our troubles. Its civil servants called in workers from Searchlight, the anti-fascist magazine, and told them the recession would bring a rise in racial violence with it. So confident is Whitehall of its grim prediction that it has already asked police forces to assign more officers to hate crime cases.</p> <p>Nick Lowles of Searchlight told me he expected a resurgence of extremism as the white far right and Islamist far right fed off each other. I paid attention because I know him to be a careful man, who always used to shy away from apocalyptic predictions. He's changed his mind because, like Cruddas, he sees malign factors converging. Rising unemployment, fights for public money and the white working class's feeling that the rest of the country either ignores them or hates them. 'The appeal of the BNP is far beyond simple racism,' he said. 'The key word which comes out in all the surveys is \"fairness\". Large sections of the white working class do not believe they are being treated justly.' The multicultural state's emphasis on what divides people rather than what unites them is making the task of changing their minds near impossible.</p> <p>Lowles has been studying the history of anti-fascism and thinks we are in a far worse position than in the Thirties or Seventies, when the left last battled the far right. Without wishing to romanticise the past, you can at least give the old left credit for having an ideology that encouraged immigrants and natives to see themselves as fellow members of the working class or - when feeling particularly high-minded - 'the brotherhood of man'.</p> <p>Naive they may have been, but how much more naive was it to 'celebrate diversity' and then be surprised when ethnic tensions rose? Like Scottish nationalism and laissez-faire regulation, the identity politics of the bubble economy is another luxury we're going to have to manage without.</p>",
  "<p>Hotel restaurants are like transvestites. They have, as they say in the transgender community, to pass; to look convincingly like the thing they are trying to be, which in this case is a stand-alone, unique enterprise rather than the lock-on to some bigger bedroom-and-minibar business - a glorified cafe which, come seven the next morning, will be setting up the breakfast buffet, where fried eggs with solid yolks and rubbery whites will fester under harsh lights. There are a bunch of hotel restaurants in London right now which pass, most of them born out of the Ramsay empire. The Italian restaurant Number Twelve, at the Ambassadors Hotel just south of London's Euston station, does not pass. It's a trannie with a heavy five o'clock shadow and big meaty hands.</p> <p>It's not merely the austere, harshly lit space. Its origins as the big room to the right of reception, where men in the duct-tape business could meet for their annual conference, are barely disguised. It's all hard lines and hard-wearing utilitarian carpet. It's things like, ooh, the fire alarm going off in the middle of dinner. At which point safety screens between the pillars that line one side of the room began to descend, hiving off the line of tables for two. At that moment our waiter was discussing wine with us, and I won't ever forget the rictus grin that set across his face as he desperately tried to pretend this wasn't happening. </p> <p>What you now need to hear is that the cooking at Number Twelve saves it from both the blight of its appearance and the occasional Towering Inferno re-enactment episode - but the truth is, it doesn't. The chef here, Santino Busciglio, writes a good menu. I like the way it references solid British produce - Devon crab, Gressingham duck, Scottish beef - in the service of solid Italian cooking, with the occasional twist or twirl. There were some things which would make you come out humming the Italian national anthem, albeit in a curious key. We liked very much the breads and a pre-starter of a smooth bean soup bobbing with sweet little clams. My starter of a thick, cauliflower soup, almost a pur\u00e9e, with a line of tiny ravioli filled with gorgonzola brought sudden kicks of flavour amid all the soothing, earthy, tongue-coating loveliness (the latter word being a technical restaurant-reviewing term). </p> <p>Nothing else was actively bad. It was all completely edible, but in the way that forces me to sit back and stare at the ceiling to recall even its low points. It was like that carpet: it did the job, without adding to the gaiety of life. A starter of that Devon crab brought a generous heap, served pleasingly close to room temperature, but the advertised curls of white radish came completely undressed or seasoned. The dish needed a burst of acidity somewhere to make it spark and flash.</p> <p>A piece of halibut with crab potatoes and samphire was similar. The cooking of the fish was faultless, but there was nothing about this collection of ingredients which made them come together into a dish. Most disappointing of all was the osso buco. Whole books have been written about this one fabulous dish: the interplay of the long braised veal with the saffron risotto beneath; the role of the nugget of glistening marrow that slips from the veal bone; the need for a sauce of depth and unctuousness that speaks of the hours of cooking required to get the meat to the right point. Propellerheads like me can write prose poems to a good osso buco; this one was barely deserving of a cringe-making homily in a Hallmark greetings card. </p> <p>The meat did not fall away. It lacked richness. The risotto was underpowered. I should feel guilty after having eaten a proper osso buco - this one made me feel hard done by. I felt the same way about my banana sundae with malt ice cream and Szechuan pepper caramel. Sounds good, doesn't it? Sounds like the creation of a kitchen with an illegally sweet tooth. In reality it ate like bananas and cream with a bit of crisp sugary stuff. And then, of course, a bill for north of \u00a3100. Yes, there is a nice wine list and the service is slick. But even allowing for the entertaining fire drill, it feels, sadly, like far too much for not enough.<br><a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\"><br>jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>John Adams, one of the most revered living classical composers, has claimed that he is blacklisted in his native America and is being followed by the security services.</p> <p>The 61-year-old musician has accused the United States of being in the grip of a political and moral panic and has complained that he is now grilled by airport immigration officers whenever he flies home because of his controversial reputation. </p> <p>Adams made his name 20 years ago with his opera Nixon in China. Although it is now regarded as a landmark in modern music, the opera made headlines when it opened because it was heavily critical of the former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger. Then the content of The Death of Klinghoffer, Adams's 1991 opera about the Palestinian Liberation Front's 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, provoked a storm of protest for its treatment of the murder of a disabled Jewish passenger.</p> <p>Interviewed on BBC Radio 3's Music Matters yesterday, Adams said he was now 'blacklisted'. 'I can't check in at the airport now without my ID being taken and being grilled. You know, I'm on a homeland security list, probably because of having written The Death of Klinghoffer, so I'm perfectly aware that I, like many artists and many thoughtful people in the country, am being followed.'</p> <p>The suggestion that Adams, who received a Pulitzer Prize for the choral work he wrote to commemorate the victims of 9/11, does not feel welcome in his own country will send shock waves through the musical world. The impact of his remarks will be amplified by the fact that his 2005 opera Doctor Atomic has its New York premiere at the Metropolitan Opera tomorrow, in a production directed by British film-maker Penny Woolcock.</p> <p>During the interview, presenter Petroc Trelawny asked Adams if he felt that America was living through an age of paranoia that resembled the McCarthy era of the Fifties.</p> <p>'Well it is, and of course Congress has continued to sign off on these Patriot Acts that continue to clip the wings of human rights,' said Adams, adding that poets, novelists and musicians with left-wing leanings are often watched, including, he said, the American composer Aaron Copland, who was 'hounded' all his life. 'I'm sure the FBI had a large file on him. So we artists assume that we are being followed.'</p> <p>Adams - whose autobiography, Hallelujah Junction, is out this month - was born in New Hampshire in 1947. His mother was a Democratic volunteer in the crucial presidential election primaries held there every four years. 'She was a passionate liberal and I've always had a fascination with political life,' he said.</p> <p>Adams went to Harvard in 1966, but abandoned his music studies for a factory job because he wanted to compose. His success was crowned following 9/11, when the New York Philharmonic invited him to compose an 'aural monument' to the victims of the terrorist attacks. His choral ode, On the Transmigration of Souls, was premiered by the orchestra in 2002.</p> <p>However, Adams believes that the Republican administration manipulated the memory of the attacks. '9/11 was a very glamorous event,' he said. 'I'm using the term in a very ironic sense - 3,000 people being killed; it's a terrible tragedy, but in the scale of human tragedy it's very small. </p> <p>'I think Americans went into what the novelist Philip Roth called \"an orgy of narcissism\" as a result of 9/11 - we kept replaying those images and kept re-reminding ourselves of what an indignation and how horrible and terrible that event was. And then, of course, we struck out by invading the wrong country.'</p>",
  "<p>Nobody goes to Heston Blumenthal's restaurant because they are feeling a bit peckish (though it happens that a visit to the Fat Duck will sate your hunger). Likewise, no one should open The Big Fat Duck Cookbook because they are looking for something to cook for supper (though it does contain recipes). You go to the Fat Duck for theatre; for intriguing flavour combinations and cooking techniques that will screw with your head and make you think about the relationship between the way we feed ourselves and our emotions. You go for green tea and vodka palate-cleansers 'cooked' in liquid nitrogen, or snail porridge the colour of grass clippings, for sardine on toast ice cream or a dessert made of all the things you'd have for breakfast (including smoky bacon ice cream). </p> <p>Appropriately, the book of the restaurant is very much more than a compendium of things you can do with interesting ingredients and nice bits of kit. It is a journey into the mind of the man who has done more than almost anybody in Britain to re-engineer the way high-end restaurants approach the knotty business of cooking for us and feeding us.</p> <p>From this, it will become clear that I am an unabashed, wet-lipped, tongue-lolling fan of Blumenthal's. In a review of one of his restaurant ventures a few years back, I said I would happily remove my underwear and chuck it at the chef, Tom Jones style. Nothing has changed. The pants are still there for the chucking. If anything, in the years I have been both eating and talking to Blumenthal about his food, my respect for the man has only grown. In the early years of this decade, one to one, he could easily launch into the sort of windy lecture on the curious qualities of certain ingredients that would make even the most diehard food head want to stab themselves in the hand with a fork. Recently, though, as his BBC2 series In Search of Perfection has proved, he has also become a master communicator.</p> <p>More cobblers will be written about this one volume than almost any other this year. Ignore the name. It is not a domestic cookbook but a document, and fits into a publishing genre that flourishes in Europe if not here: the statement-cum-catalogue by a big-name chef. Pierre Gagnaire, Marc Veyrat and Ferran Adri\u00e0 have each produced volumes like this, all retailing for more than the \u00a3100 being charged for this one, all standing as a definitive statement of the chef's work to date. It was high time for Blumenthal to do his. Few, though, are as elegant, or as complete an object as this, from the duck-feather motifs, through the silver page-edging, to the multicoloured ribbon bookmarks. </p> <p>What Blumenthal has produced is, in truth, three books in one. At the front is the autobiography, beautifully and wittily illustrated by Dave McKean, who has reinvented the man as the fictional hero of his own narrative, all domed forehead, questing chin and razor-sharp glasses. That said, this is not some grimly narcissistic sleb memoir. If there is an anecdote here, it is because of the part it played in Blumenthal's development as a chef. </p> <p>Next comes the complete Fat Duck recipes, with the glossiest and filthiest of gastro-porn photography. (Who knew the whipping of a pink spiced pickling foam could look so, well, gynaecological?) These recipes are staggeringly long, involve fiendishly expensive pieces of equipment, are extraordinarily detailed and are probably, for the home cook, completely unmanageable, but that's to miss the point. As Blumenthal himself says: 'To change any part of these recipes so that they are more easily achievable would be to compromise - something this book does not do.' </p> <p>Even so, they are worth reading, partly because there are sub-recipes that are within reach (try the gratin of truffled macaroni), partly to appreciate the remarkable effort required to achieve the effect, and partly because it's fun to spot unlikely ingredients. Sure, there are references to substances from the industrial food world like the emulsifier lecithin and the protein 'glue' transglutaminase (oh, the things you can do to mackerel fillets with that). But there are also walk-on parts for frozen peas, mass-produced white bread and Marmite. Blumenthal is big on the flavours of our childhood, the easiest way to open the door to our memories, and he is not afraid to investigate the emotional punch of that nostalgia through his tasting menu.</p> <p>Finally there is the science stuff, a set of explanations so complete and detailed they've had to drop the type size to get it all in. And that, finally, is the point of this book: nothing has been left out; it is all here. It is true that a lot of enthusiastic home cooks will receive this as a gift this Christmas, pore over the pictures, read the text and never once cook from it. But an awful lot of professional chefs will also buy it, study the science section in detail, examine the recipes and let that influence seep deep into their own cooking. Those wrong-headed, appetite-challenged killjoys who are suspicious of what Blumenthal does will regard this as an unfortunate development. As for me, I can only see it as a very good thing indeed.</p>",
  "<p>In Rochester, Northumberland, the last village before Scotland, Rupert Mitford, the 6th Baron Redesdale, and Paul Parker, a pest controller, are examining a map. We are in Redesdale's kitchen, in a cottage that borders the Otterburn army base. Chinook helicopters fly low up the valley, the last stop before Helmand and Basra. Redesdale and Parker, however, are organising battle lines of their own. </p> <p>Redesdale, in a lived-in tweed jacket, eventually locates his home on the well-used Ordnance Survey. 'This house was ground zero,' he says. 'In the first six months we had cleared everything to here,' he gestures towards a wooded area to the south. 'May to June we got down to this line here. July we did Newcastle.'</p> <p>Parker, shaven headed, chips in, in his broad Geordie, tracing his finger along the Tyne. 'We were doing the damage in this area. They can swim, but they'd rather use the bridges. We hammered them here and here and here. Now we are really hunting them down in ones and twos.'</p> <p>Redesdale continues, with boyish excitement. 'We developed what we called our killing strategy. Hit them in the woods. Dipton Woods: we took 2,000 out. If you clear a woodland you suck all the surrounding population to it. Then you hit them again. Suck 'em in, hit them.'</p> <p>'Slaley Forest,' Parker says. 'We took 3,500 out of there. In the winter there's no cover and you can pick them off with the .22 rifle. They all get together in the cold. You can get eight or nine with a couple of shots. All huddled together. We just annihilated them.'</p> <p>Redesdale is a tall, consummately charming, slightly distracted man, who attended public schools in north London and studied archaeology at Newcastle. He can trace his bloodline back to the Norman conquests; the Mitford sisters were his great aunts. Having been relieved of his hereditary peerage in Blair's reforms, he became the youngest elected life peer and is now, at 41, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for the environment in the second chamber. Parker, who grew up in the west end of Newcastle, was not much for school. Once he was seven or eight he was off in the fields, rabbiting, shooting crows and starlings and selling them to local butchers for pies. He and Redesdale, who rents him a house up the road, are an unlikely double act. Together, camouflaged crusaders, they form the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership.</p> <p>This is not a resurgent Tufty Club. 'We only call ourselves the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership because if we called it the Grey Squirrel Annihilation League people might be a bit less sympathetic,' Redesdale announces, chuckling. 'But we do nothing with red squirrels apart from save them by killing grey squirrels!' </p> <p>In the two years of their existence, Redesdale and Parker have been remarkably successful. While other conservation groups go in for education or re-habitation, they favour genocide. With a recruited army of 900 volunteers - grannies and game wardens, families and farmers - they have slaughtered 19,500 grey squirrels in the past 18 months and claim to have cleared England's northernmost county of the rodent. The grannies, Redesdale suggests, tend to be the most bloodthirsty trappers. 'It's like: \"Can you beat it to death with a hammer and let me watch?\" We had one old dear who went inside and came back out with a sort of elephant gun: \"Do you want to shoot it with this?\"'</p> <p>Parker and Redesdale are now making plans for Yorkshire, if they can find funding. Parker really dreams, however, of getting down to London, 'taking out - what is it? - Hampstead Heath, the parks. Hit them in their own backyard.' This, Redesdale adds, despite the fact that his partner gets a nosebleed if he leaves Northumberland, and on the one occasion he tried London had a panic attack on the tube. Even so, the baron does not rule out the capital. Lately, he confesses, he has been testing kill traps in Tufnell Park.</p> <p>I first met Redesdale a few weeks earlier, in the House of Lords' tearoom. There he explained how his private army came together. A couple of years ago, he said, he felt he had been lacking purpose in his life. He had the peerage, his work, his wife, Helen (a lawyer), four wonderful kids, a house in north London, and the cottage and several hundred tenanted acres in the valley that bears his name, but he was lying awake wondering about the meaning of it all. 'Now,' he said, trying to suppress a giggle, 'I lie awake working out how to kill squirrels.'</p> <p>A man needs a hobby. In this case it began when Redesdale was asked to make a speech in the Lords about the plight of the red squirrel in March 2006. He had spent every summer of his childhood, the second youngest of seven children, and the only boy, in the woods around the cottage in Rochester; since these were strongholds of the red squirrel he knew a good deal about the subject. Most of all he knew, as every English schoolboy knew, how the native red thoroughbreds had been forced back by the rapacious American greys and now stood on the edge of extinction.</p> <p>The debate itself proved a catalyst in Redesdale's thinking. It was moved by Earl Peel, who described the red squirrel as 'an iconic creature, immortalised by Beatrix Potter'. These days, however, Peel went on, 'Squirrel Nutkin must think to himself, \"How could it have all gone so wretchedly wrong for me?\" Why couldn't he, like Tommy Brock, have employed a top public relations firm and secured himself as a logo for a major conservation body?' </p> <p>The grey squirrel was presented by Peel as the scourge of all right-thinking people, carrier of the brutal squirrel pox which wiped out any reds that came into contact with it in days. A scavenger, it was the black-eyed destroyer of trees and bird populations. Peel ended with an impassioned plea. 'Walking as I do through St James's Park from time to time, I cannot help noticing the absence of common or garden birds. Where are the tits?' he asked. 'Where are the warblers?'</p> <p>Redesdale picked up in the debate where Peel had left off. 'In Regent's Park,' he began, 'a grey squirrel came up to my son and me and actually climbed up my leg to look in my pocket...' Before he was able to add 'in search of nuts', Lord Hoyle butted in. 'In St James's Park one ran up my trouser leg and bit me!'</p> <p>These peer-bothering trouser rats were even now on the march. 'I have some woodland in Northumberland that has red squirrels,' Redesdale went on. 'Last year, however, we found our first grey squirrel - it had been killed in the road - so it will surely not be too long before the grey squirrels arrive. I am just on the edge of Kielder Forest, and it is very depressing to think that that last bastion is under threat...'</p> <p>Of course, no pillar of the establishment likes to see bastions threatened and this roused others to the fray. Lady Saltoun of Abernethy, who had red squirrels dancing on the lawns of her estate, had no doubt what we were dealing with. 'Red squirrels are rather like quiet, well-behaved people,' she observed, 'who do not make a nuisance or an exhibition of themselves, or commit crimes, and so do not get themselves into the papers in the vulgar way grey squirrels do.'</p> <p>The grey squirrels' celebrity-seeking hoodie behaviour was the least of it. Battalions of vulgarian American rodents were fanning out across Europe. Lord Chorley, who wondered if he might be the only member present who had taken tea with Beatrix Potter herself, in 1941 (she put him in mind of Mrs Tiggy-Winkle), spoke darkly of how, contrary to what the New Labour government had recently claimed, grey squirrels were right now massing on the continent. 'There are three colonies, if that is the right word, in Italy. At least one of them is in the process of crossing the Alps. If they get to Germany there will be a complete invasion taking place.'</p> <p>By the time Lord Inglewood took the floor, emotion was running high. 'Squirrels are said to be good to eat,' he declared. 'The great chef Brillat-Savarin created a banquet of grey squirrels stewed in Madeira, together with partridge wings en papillote and roast turkey.' Mr Jamie Oliver had to be summoned. Inglewood finished with a stirring call to arms. 'The red squirrels have had Chamberlains and not Churchills!' he cried. 'But it is Churchills that they need!'</p> <p>Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Rupert Redesdale is far from a bloodthirsty fellow - he had never killed anything in anger since he had been on Operation Raleigh in Africa in his gap year and it had been his turn to throttle a chicken - but something about the squirrels' plight stirred old emotions in his blood. He was a Mitford after all.</p> <p>It was, he decided, not just the pox that was killing red squirrels, it was bureaucracy. A whopping \u00a3626,000 of Lottery money had recently been awarded to a group called Save our Squirrels, drawn from various nature conservation agencies, but the money had been given on the understanding that none of it would be used to pursue what seemed to be the only hope of salvation for the beleaguered native rodent: it could not be spent on culling greys. </p> <p>Redesdale spoke to the relevant office at Defra to point out the absurdity of this. There were more than 2m greys and only, at best, 160,000 reds. Appeasement was not an option. Defra suggested to him that as they were coming to the end of their budgetary year there might be some funds available. So Redesdale sat up over the following weekend and produced a grant application. It was a strange kind of document. In the space marked 'turnover' he wrote 'nil', in that for 'product' he listed 'dead squirrels'. Still, he got the money, nearly \u00a3150,000 of it, and then sat at his kitchen table and worked out how best to spend it.</p> <p>The original plan was to start lots of little squirrel groups all over the county, spread the word about the danger and get people to start trapping. In the event, Redesdale, a man who never quite seems in control of his laughter, found he was spending more time on team-building than on carnage. Save our Squirrels wanted to be involved. They had four full-time squirrel preservation officers who came to meetings. </p> <p>There was much discussion about whether it was possible to use the 'k' word - 'cull was OK, kill apparently was not,' Redesdale recalls. There was fear of reprisals. At the first board meeting of the RSPP they spent an hour discussing what they would do when the first death threat came in. 'We decided we were quite lucky because they had just arrested most of the Animal Liberation Front,' Redesdale remembers. (They have so far received four letters of complaint, one suggesting a grey squirrel zoo.)</p> <p>Just when he was starting to despair, however, Redesdale met Paul Parker. The pest controller was of the opinion that 'you can be through the area and have cleared it of squirrels by the time you have bought the biscuits for a coffee morning'. They worked on a new foolproof trap, and found a local man to knock up 1,000 in his shed. And it was then, Redesdale recalls, that they really started motoring.</p> <p>There are some pest control vans that favour discretion. The kind that, if parked in a restaurant car park, might keep the patrons guessing about their purpose. Paul Parker's van is not one of those. On back and sides, in the largest possible type, are the words 'Bees, wasps, bed bugs, squirrels, fleas, cockroaches, rodents, rabbits. You hate them, we love them!' There is, too, a squirrel hotline number. If a grey is spotted anywhere in the county, Parker will be on its case immediately with his traps and his rifles. In this way, he reckons, he has been covering up to 4,000 miles in a week.</p> <p>At any moment his phone could ring and we could be off to Hexham or Corbridge. From six in the morning people start calling and they don't stop until late at night. 'At 11 o'clock they've just come in from work, and there's a squirrel in the trap, they want me to shoot it. I can have 10 to do before I wake up in the morning.'</p> <p>This morning, however, Parker's phone is stubbornly silent. There is, it seems, not a squirrel to be shot for 50 miles in any direction. We set off anyway on Parker's regular rounds, checking traps for nuts, catching up with his volunteer army, and while we drive he recounts tales of more memorable mornings. There was the drive-by shooting near Blaydon: 'We were doing about 40 and there's a grey by the side of the road, brushing its hair: I lined him up with the air rifle, bang, straight through the chest.' And Stumpy, the last grey in Slayley, who had lost half his tail. 'He was a swine, took us a couple of weeks to get him. We just fed him, waited until he eventually dropped his guard, and then: bam!'</p> <p>Parker is a superstitious man. In particular he will not pronounce the name of his most resolute adversary. When they crop up in conversation, rats are thus always 'long tails' or 'tin hats'. ('Pig' and 'monkey' are problematic words for him in this regard, too.) As we drive over bridges, he somewhat disconcertingly lifts his feet from the car's pedals. 'Devil's water,' he says. </p> <p>Mrs Sanderson, in Hexham, is a kindly looking woman, and at 82 the oldest volunteer in the RSPP. She is also among its most successful squirrel catchers. Over the past year or so she has taken about 40 squirrels from the trap under her bird table, though more, she muses, if you count all the nursing mothers among them. 'There would be the starving little ones with those, too, I suppose.'</p> <p>She remembers the days when the reds used to come to the back door of her council house. She hasn't seen one for years, but at least the traps give her something to watch with her breakfast. 'You are just willing them to get in there,' she says of the greys, 'when they come sniffing around, destroying everything.' At first, when Parker came to shoot a squirrel she wouldn't watch. But now she does. 'I give him a bag to carry them out in, too,' she explains. 'Actually it's one from the RSPCA.'</p> <p>I mention that a colony of unusually large black squirrels, a colour mutation of the grey, is establishing a stronghold in Cambridgeshire, because the females there seem to prefer the muscular new breed. Mrs Sanderson winces at the idea. Last night she dreamt that she opened her front door and there were two red squirrels on the steps there talking to her. 'They will come,' Parker reassures her, 'don't you worry.' Since the grey squirrel cull, red squirrels have started re-establishing themselves all over the county. One was recently seen in Jesmond Park in Newcastle. 'It gives people round here hope,' Parker observes, 'and they will be back here, too.'</p> <p>We wander out to inspect Mrs Sanderson's trap, in vain. We move on, scanning the horizon, in search of the last grey squirrel in Northumberland. </p> <p>By mid-afternoon we are at a quarry with Reg Ord, another member of Lord Redesdale's squirrel army. Ord, 42, is an infamous bouncer in Newcastle's Bigg Market (a 'nightclub ejection technician,' he suggests). As broad as he is tall, with a neck like a sack of cement, Ord's day job is manning a Tarmac weighbridge. The company gives him an hour a day for conservation projects - the certificates are on the walls of his Portakabin. In corners of the quarried land Ord thus puts out strips of tin to attract newts - 'mostly palmates', Ord says, 'plus the odd great-crested' - and he shoots squirrels. He's had 500 since he started, just around the site here, but none today.</p> <p>Parker suggests this is a sign they are winning, but Ord is not happy. Thing is, someone has been messing with his traps. Stamping on them, driving over them. He shows us the flattened items at the back of his Portakabin, all the while recounting tales of his history as a doorman. 'I've been shot at and stabbed and hit with lumps of wood and bricks and bottles. They only ever try it once, mind. Bloke phoned me up three in the morning, told me how he was going to shoot me, the calibre of the rifle and all. The police wanted me to wear a vest, but I had an idea who it was. Next time he came in the bar I really gave it to him...' Ord recalls the encounter with some relish. 'Had no calls since.'</p> <p>If you had a hankering to liberate grey squirrels, I can't help thinking, it is probably not Reg Ord's squirrel traps that you would choose to stamp on first. Does he have an idea who is doing it?</p> <p>'I've got my suspicions, but you cannot prove nowt. I'll find out though. And when I find the fucker, he'll have it, too.'</p> <p>We drive on. Parker's phone sits on the seat beside him, mute. The story is the same with all the other trappers we meet. On the way home, at the bridge near Corsham, after a squirrel-free day, Parker lifts his feet from the car pedals. 'Devil's water,' he says.</p> <p>The longer you spend in Northumberland the more you realise what a very long way from anywhere else it is. The Observer's photographer, Gary Calton, and I are staying in a curious country house hotel in Otterburn that was recently converted into a hostel for asylum seekers. When there was a local protest at the prospect of the incomers, however, it reverted to being a hotel. We are the only guests. They are preparing for a wedding at the weekend, at which all of the party will be dressed in orangutan costumes.</p> <p>Overnight, I begin to develop a theory that the suspicion about incomers has also fuelled some of the zeal of the squirrel operation. The greys, adaptable and robust, are evidence of Darwin in action. They hugely outbreed the reds - four to eight in a litter, three or four times a year. They also out-eat them. Reds, vegetarians, need a lot of seeds. The greys will eat anything. They will take mince pies from children's hands. In Scotland they will drink Irn Bru. There was a story of squirrels addicted to crack cocaine in Brixton. </p> <p>If there is a class war aspect to this struggle, the aristocracy brought it on themselves. The first grey squirrels came to Britain as amusing mementoes of the New World in the early 19th century. The gentry kept them in cages as pets. It is thought that in 1876 a Mr Brocklehurst, who had brought a pair over from America, released them to see how they would fare in the wild. </p> <p>With all of this in mind I go to sleep thinking even the House of Lords can't stop evolution. The following morning, though, Redesdale puts me right. </p> <p>'Your problem is that you have never seen a red squirrel,' he says. And it's true, I haven't. 'The first time you see a red squirrel you will get it immediately. The hairs stand up on your neck. Half the primates in the world are about to go extinct and here is an extraordinary animal native to this country that is about to disappear because we can't be bothered to save it. Paul and I have proved it can be done. The RSPCA says what we do, though legal, is unethical; Save our Squirrels call us cowboys. But how can it possibly be ethical to let a wonderful native animal be lost to future generations for ever?'</p> <p>Parker, still in his combat gear, is teary-eyed when it comes to reds.</p> <p>'I think they are mystical animals. There is something so spirited about them; I saw my first one back in the Seventies, but every time they still affect me the same way. To think they have been here since the Ice Age and we might be seeing the last of them here is something I really don't want to think about.'</p> <p>The news has been carrying items about how the ancient red squirrel population in Formby, Lancashire, has been quickly devastated by squirrel pox with the arrival of the grey. The conservation groups had given red squirrels 10 years in Northumberland; Redesdale reckons they had four, tops. Now at least they have a fighting chance. 'We have to keep vigilant,' he says, 'have to keep pushing the greys back.' </p> <p>Having failed to find a grey squirrel to shoot yesterday, today we are going in search of a red squirrel to photograph. The grounds of Eshott Hall in the northeast of the county are considered a good bet. For several hours, therefore, Gary and me and Paul Parker and Redesdale study the tree canopy for the movement of red squirrels - unlike the grey they rarely come to ground, and when they do they move like quicksilver.</p> <p>Eventually, with legs cramping up, we spot a pair high up in the tree under which we are crouching, whispering. Redesdale and Parker are right, it is a perfectly charged moment (though partly a relief to see any squirrel at all). Smaller than the greys, the red squirrels chase each other across the high branches. When they sense us they stop stock-still, and then they chatter furiously. Parker says it has been like this on the few occasions he has had a red in the traps. When he has let it go it has been away like liquid, but has always stopped halfway up a tree to fix him with a stare and chunter at top speed. 'It's like, \"Hey mate, you got the wrong man there.\"'</p> <p>Watching these squirrels Parker becomes reverential, almost spooked. 'The greys are just tin hats really. They are nothing like the reds. You see a red and every one is different, they have individual characters. Sharp eyes, little tufts on their ears. They respect the place they live in. A grey squirrel is just a grey squirrel.'</p> <p>Wondering whether it is possible for a squirrel to show respect, we leave Eshott and go in search of a fabled man who feeds red squirrels from his hand in Kielder Forest. We are led to his cottage at the side of Kielder Lake by word of mouth. Everyone knows the squirrel man. And when we get there we immediately see why he has his reputation.</p> <p>Having spent most of the day scanning treetops for red squirrels, suddenly they are everywhere, standing on their hind legs, hopping up to the cottage door. Don Clegg is a retired woodwork teacher with a hint of red about his beard. There have been squirrels coming down from the forest here for 20 years. At the moment they have about seven that arrive for monkey nuts every morning and in the afternoons. Over the years the numbers have dropped, but now they are coming back again. </p> <p>Clegg is all for Redesdale's campaign. They had Bill Oddie up here but, like the squirrels, like the SOS group, like the Wildlife Trust, he sat on the fence, wouldn't say that killing greys was the answer. To Clegg it's a no-brainer. What does he think makes the reds so special? </p> <p>'It's simple really,' he says, 'it's just like they belong here.'</p> <p>That evening over supper, Redesdale tells some tales of his Mitford aunts in their natural habitats. His relations with them were distant but formative. Jessica told him not to be so stupid when he boldly announced he wanted to be an army chaplain at the age of 16; Debo, Duchess of Devonshire, recently invited them all to tea at Chatsworth and they fretted about taking their son who was in the middle of potty training; Redesdale's father was absolutely scared stiff of Nancy. All the time he talks, though, the conversation comes back to squirrels. I wonder if he has ever eaten any. Somewhat sheepishly, he admits he hasn't. It seems to me the next day might be a good moment to start.</p> <p>We meet Parker in the morning behind enemy lines near the Angel of the North. On this side of the Tyne there are still plenty of greys and he has put some traps down here to assess the reserve strength of the population. He has his daughter Bronwyn with him in the van. 'She loves to tell her friends at school what she gets up to with her dad and the squirrels,' Parker says proudly. 'I don't,' says Bronwyn flatly.</p> <p>We walk up a hillside in the woods, checking traps. Two contain squirrels, both juvenile males apparently, anxiously checking the mesh for an exit. Parker takes them back to the van.</p> <p>'I shoot them in the back of the head,' he says. 'You have to shoot them just behind the ear. If you hit them in the middle of the skull you can miss the brain.'</p> <p>He lets them into the killing trap and trains an air gun through the mesh. The car door is open and a Queen CD is playing. As the squirrels find their way over to the gun barrel, 'Don't Stop Me Now' is booming. As squirrels number 19,547 and 19,548 are dispatched, thick blood seeping from their wounds, 'Another One Bites the Dust' might seem more appropriate.</p> <p>Parker puts the carcasses in the back of his van. He's had a call from Mrs Sanderson, who has caught another squirrel in her trap this morning, and we are to meet Lord Redesdale at her house. 'We are like the fourth emergency service,' he says.</p> <p>Along the way, Parker discusses the possibilities for a new kill trap that will dispense with the need for shooting. It's like a huge mouse trap, he says, but they have had a few near misses with fingers in setting it up, so it's not quite right yet. </p> <p>I wonder if he has a sense that the squirrels know they are being hunted now?</p> <p>'When it gets down to the last few in a wood, I'd say definitely,' Parker suggests. 'When they are on the back foot they all know about it. Then it's a question of getting into their minds, under their skins.'</p> <p>At the back of Mrs Sanderson's house another squirrel, out-thought, is awaiting its fate. Redesdale is already there and Parker suggests that he takes the shot.</p> <p>'If I must,' he says. He stands over the cage and shoots the squirrel, with some aplomb, from the hip. Blood stains Mrs Sanderson's patio, but she's impressed.</p> <p>'My, you are a good shot,' she says of Redesdale's marksmanship from two inches.</p> <p>'Well, he's a lord, he has to be,' Parker observes.</p> <p>We all stare down at the squirrel, just now a livewire. 'When you start you get very nervous. But after a while you get to know how to relax into it,' Redesdale says. </p> <p>The first 17,000 are the worst, I suppose.</p> <p>The peer is confident there was no suffering. 'It was a bit bothered, but it wasn't too bothered, and then it was dead.'</p> <p>It is decided with something just short of enthusiasm that we will have the squirrels for tea. For a year now the RSPP has been supplying Ridley's Fish and Game of Corbridge with dead squirrels, and a market has developed for the meat. Parker gets 75p a squirrel and David Ridley, who runs the business, sells them oven ready at \u00a32.25 wholesale, \u00a33.25 over the counter. There has been a good deal of mail-order interest, mainly from restaurants and individuals in London. Over the summer demand has far outstripped supply.</p> <p>The only problem, Ridley suggests when we get there, is that unlike rabbits, squirrels take a long time to skin. One of his skinners has it down to a fine art. He blowtorches them first to get rid of the fleas and then gets to work on the fur. Even so it still takes three minutes per animal. </p> <p>That skinner is not around today so Parker does the squirrels himself on a bench alongside a deadpan pigeon plucker. While Parker tears at the squirrels' stubborn skins, David Ridley discusses ways of cooking squirrels. 'They have no fat on them and they live mostly on berries and nuts so the flesh is sweet. I've roasted them. I've flash-fried them with fresh thyme.' One restaurant has done well with a confit of grey squirrel served with pine nuts; Ridley and Redesdale have been discussing the possibility of the canap\u00e9 market. And yes, each squirrel they sell does indeed have to carry the label 'May contain nuts'.</p> <p>Back at Redesdale's cottage, we present him with the flayed rodents, now under cellophane. He looks at them with forced cheer.</p> <p>There must be times when he regrets becoming the squirrels' champion. </p> <p>'It's like everything,' he suggests, smiling. 'It seemed like a good idea at the time.' </p> <p>Is that how Helen, his wife, feels about it, I wonder. Over the past couple of days she has offered an affectionately ironic chorus to her husband's obsession. </p> <p>'There is,' she says diplomatically, 'no doubt they are doing brilliantly for the reds, but it can take over rather.'</p> <p>'I'll cook 'em!' Redesdale suggests brightly, before displaying a rather worrying unfamiliarity with the hob controls.</p> <p>Eventually the squirrel sizzles dutifully in the pan. Small tufts of fur still cling to its flanks. Redesdale pokes at it with a spatula and laughs a little nervously. </p> <p>'What is it?' asks his elder daughter.</p> <p>'It's squiwwel!' her sister confirms.</p> <p>'Perhaps I should have quartered it,' Redesdale says. The skinned squirrel lies spatchcocked on its back, paws upwards.</p> <p>Paul Parker is due but there is no sign of him; Bronwyn, who has joined us for supper, suggests he is feeling a little tired. Or maybe he's sampled Redesdale's cooking before.</p> <p>At the stove, Redesdale discusses other media opportunities. 'We have been approached to do a TV series,' he confesses. 'BBC3 I think.'</p> <p>It might, I suggest, make a nice antidote to Springwatch - Northumberland Slaughter</p> <p>'Isn't BBC3 the comedy channel?' Lady Redesdale wonders, drily.</p> <p>Redesdale serves up the squirrel. He cuts a piece off and tucks in with some bravado, offering a commentary while chewing. 'This is the saddle. It's not bad, there's no fat on it.' In a reluctant John Selwyn Gummer moment he feeds a little to his children, and gives a sizeable pink-looking haunch to me. We all chew ruminatively on the slightly raw squirrel and think for a moment. 'It tastes like chicken,' we agree. </p> <p>'Very good chicken,' Redesdale suggests, optimistically. Not for the first time, his wife raises an eyebrow. </p> <p>On the draining board two more skinned rodents are waiting to be cooked. The more he eats, though, the more Redesdale brightens. 'This is rather wonderful,' he declares. 'We can now officially eat them into extinction!' He returns to the flesh and bones on his plate with the look of a man who has woken with the solution to a problem that had troubled him the night before.</p> <p>'One down,' I say, swallowing a gamey mouthful, 'and only 2m to go.'</p>",
  "<p>One of the treasured trophies from my years spent editing the men's magazine Arena is a framed issue from 1994 which hangs in my loo, signed, 'To Kate, with love and admiration, Hugh M Hefner', while the signature was acquired when I visited the Playboy Mansion for the first time, three years later, to interview him for a previous incarnation of this magazine. </p> <p>To my surprise, Hef and I got on like the proverbial burning mansion, talking editor-to-editor about magazines, his professional legacy (every men's magazine from GQ to Zoo owes Hef a debt), about women, and men, and the gender chasm, and then, after an hour or so, when the ice had not so much been broken but crushed and stirred into a long cool cocktail, I accused him of having sold other men the idea that marriage was effectively the death of hope - that beyond the pram in the hallway, on the other side of the fence, lies a yellow-brick road leading to an orgiastic Ozworld of commitment-phobic male hedonism, and also that (all things considered, at the end of the day ...) he was therefore partly responsible for the recent breakdown of my brief marriage.</p> <p>Perched on the edge of a leather sofa in his study, wearing his black silk pyjamas, the then happily married (to former Playmate Kimberley Conrad) Hef took it like a man. He was intrigued, he asked insightful questions about my personal circumstances, he identified that 'You're still in pain, aren't you?', he was warm, kind, clever and avuncular (I asked if I could call him my 'Uncle Hef' and he laughingly agreed) and I wanted to hug him.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards we found ourselves upstairs, in his bedroom, on his circular bed, bouncing and giggling while the Playboy PR leaned against the door jamb, smiling: 'Kate, I gotta say, this never happens!' 'Well, it does,' said Hef, 'but not with journalists.' </p> <p>The interview never ran. On Sunday 31 August 1997 I was in the office attempting to finish the piece for the following Sunday's paper, but what with the breaking news of Princess Diana's death, I suspected that tomorrow we were likely to be tearing up what we had prepared and starting again. And lo, it came to pass.</p> <p>Some months later, news arrived that Hef was no longer happily married, that his ex-wife Kimberley had moved next door with the kids, and he was back out on the tiles with a bunch of blondes young enough to be his granddaughters, so the magazine's editor suggested I update the story. We spoke on the phone. I told him I was upset he'd reverted to such predictable type; I'd preferred the Hef who'd believed in happy endings. He laughed, said it was a happy ending, that there was a great deal to be said for Viagra ... We agreed to differ. 'Call anytime,' said Uncle Hef, sweetly, as he signed off. I didn't, of course, but I like to think he meant it. </p> <p>So I am saddened to discover that things are not going quite so well for 'Uncle Hef', now 83: the Playboy empire (run by his fiftysomething daughter from his first marriage, Christie Hefner) is suffering, its share price down to $2.33 from $12 a year ago, while for the first time the Mansion's infamous invite-only parties are taking bookings from paying guests ($5,000-$25,000 a ticket). And then, since two of his three current live-in-loves have just ditched him in favour of younger models (including 'No 1 girlfriend' Holly Madison, the woman he considers his soulmate. They'd tried for a baby and failed), Hef's personal life is also in disarray. Last week he was described as broken-hearted: 'I've been feeling like roadkill.' </p> <p>'We - men - are not the enemy,' Hef told me back in 1997. 'We both want similar things but we express them in very different ways ... Romantic love and marriage are dreams and myths, but who'd want to live without them? Even with what you've just gone through, what you still do not want to accept is that it was all a myth. What you want is for that myth to be true. And Kate, so do I ...' </p> <p>Hef, it turned out, was a closet romantic, generously living the dream so that the rest of mankind doesn't have to. He's all heart. I hope it mends soon.<br><a href=\"mailto:kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk\"><br>kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Me Cheeta is a truly terrible idea for a book: the cover is lousy, the first chapter lame, the entire conceit of a memoir written by a chimpanzee - Cheeta from the Tarzan films and the oldest chimp alive - stomach-churningly cute. And, as it turns out, it's also the best celebrity memoir you'll read this year, and it's not even a memoir. Or only ostensibly: it's actually a rather joyous satire on Hollywood's Golden Age, with Cheeta its simian F Scott Fitzgerald.</p> <p>He's rude, funny, vindictive, revelatory, brutal. The list of people he despises includes Rex Harrison ('a weakling and a bully and a near murderer, scumbag, self-pitier, miser, liar, ass'), his former co-star Maureen O'Sullivan ('about as effervescent as a gin and tonic left all winter in a shuttered summer house'), and the 'inimitable' Maureen O'Hara ('in reality highly imitable. I myself can do a reasonable Maureen O'Hara by simply screeching as loudly as I can and flinging my excrement around').</p> <p>Charlie Chaplin, meanwhile, is a 'utopian dolt, cradlesnatcher, self-mythologizer and (need I say it ?) sentimentalist', with 'his unerring knack for perfectly duff pseudo-poetry' and 'his three fucking Oscars. The difference between us, Charlie - the crucial difference... between us - is that nobody has ever once called my work \"dated\"'. Kate Hepburn has 'her Connecticutian sense of entitlement', Claudette Colbert is as 'tight with a compliment as she was with a nickel', while Marlene Dietrich is 'enigmatic and compelling and stinking of urine'. </p> <p>Cheeta is both the innocent abroad - when he's captured in Liberia and shipped to America he believes he's being taken into rehab - and the all-knowing cynic. 'Everything dream-sharp and sparkling,' he writes at one point, 'like Beverly Hills in Cary Grant's LSD-inflected eyes'. </p> <p>He takes to Hollywood so well because he recognises its hierarchies and divisions, the studio bosses, 'the seven Alphas' of LA. After describing a practical joke masterminded by Johnny Weissmuller and David Niven, in which Cheeta drove - and totalled - Douglas Fairbanks's Rolls-Royce, he points out that 'all of this was just to attract the attention of some sexually receptive females'.</p> <p>His relationship with Weissmuller is a loving portrait of the former Olympic swimmer turned Hollywood actor, who among the sharks and crooks of Hollywood really is an innocent abroad. The final meeting between him and Cheeta in Mexico, his health and money gone, is almost unbearably poignant. </p> <p>But there's so much to enjoy here, whether it's Cheeta's description of Weissmuller's marriage to Lupe V\u00e9lez - 'one of those lifetime monogamous arrangements (his third)' - or his attitude to his reviews: 'The garnering of critical acclaim has never meant much to me - quite unlike the role it played in Charlie's life, which was pretty similar to the role morphine played in Bela Lugosi's or the erect male sexual organ in dear, sweet Mary Astor's.'</p> <p>While there's a certain amount about animal rights in here - Cheeta as a sort of Black Beauty for the 20th century - it's as satire that it works best of all. Of his training he says: 'How could I have known that the starving and beating all formed part of Louis Mayer's painstaking grooming process - almost the same process as MGM put Ava Gardner through.' </p> <p>Me Cheeta is the unlikeliest contender for this year's Guardian First Book Award. It won't win (will it?) but you'll not read a better evocation of celebritydom than Cheeta describing his arrival in New York: 'If you want to know what being famous feels like, what it means - and I speak as perhaps the most famous animal alive today - then picture a human and a chimpanzee facing each other in awkward silence, with nothing to be said, the faint inanity of the interaction stealing over both of them. That's what fame is.'</p>",
  "<p>A pink sunrise over Green Bay. As the breath stands out in the freezing cold of an autumn Wisconsin morning, the roads around Lambeau Field are already stirring. It is game day for the Green Bay Packers - the American football team formed on a local street corner in 1919 and owned by their fans - and the Atlanta Falcons are in town.</p> <p>Gazebos, grills, hammocks, makeshift bars, tables and deckchairs have been left in preparation outside homes overnight. And when Lambeau Field's vast car park is opened four hours before the midday kick-off, the tailgate parties begin, as they do in every other available space around the stadium. </p> <p>On the back of cars, station wagons, pick-ups and vans, thousands of soon-to-be-very-drunk Cheeseheads, as Packers fans are known, many wearing hats shaped like a triangular cheddar slice, hang posters and pennants, and position armchairs and sofas. Music blares, barbecues are fired, bratwurst and steaks dipped in marinade, whisky, wine, vodka and endless crates of beer appear. A very merry time begins.</p> <p>'Look at my tattoos,' says a man who calls himself Santa. He is an enthusiastic 51-year-old with a long grey beard and flowing hair and must weigh around 20st. He is tailgating with friends behind an ambulance, which is parked next to a van that has two gigantic pink flamingos on the roof. Draped over the ambulance are bras - red, green, yellow, orange, blue, black, brown, and some that need cleaning.</p> <p>'There's Rudolph the Reindeer, this one's a little girl whispering into Father Christmas's ear,' Santa says pulling up his Packers shirt to show his tattoos. 'It's my job, every year I give out presents. I start 31 October. You want a beer? Soon I'll get the grey drained from my beard. It takes three goes for that. Then the hairdresser uses white toner to make it like Santa Claus. Every week it costs $175 (\u00a3100) for a retouch.' </p> <p>All of Green Bay, a tiny city of around 100,000 people on the shores of Lake Michigan, seems to have congregated here, as it does on each of the eight regular-season home games of the NFL season. Since 1960, every game at the stadium named after founder and first head coach, Earl 'Curly' Lambeau, has been a sell-out. There are 80,000 people on the season-ticket waiting-list and, with 30 or 40 becoming available each year, tailgating is how many Cheeseheads get closest to their beloved team. In a state with the second lowest beer-tax - six cents - and ranked America's worst for alcohol abuse, this means a lot of drinking. </p> <p>Santa's friend Dave will not reveal his surname 'in case my wife finds out'. He is wearing a sticker that says The Optimistic Gent, is drinking beer and is the ambulance owner. </p> <p>'We just got more,' roars a tipsy Santa pointing to a star-spangled bra. Bleary eyed, Dave explains. 'In 2000 when they began redoing the stadium we did a campaign, \"Support the Legend.\" And we kept on. Bras give support, right?' he says, not quite sure the joke is understood. </p> <p>Dave produces a collection of photographs - there are hundreds - that feature the owners of the bras swaying free in the cold Wisconsin wind. In place to protect the modesty of the topless women - who range in age - are Packers stickers shaped like Playboy bunnies. </p> <p>'It's freezing, there isn't much else to do in Wisconsin,' Dave says. 'So you drink and follow the Packers.' Which is what occurs until noon and beyond for a game the Packers will lose 27-24. Some Cheeseheads go into Lambeau Field, some pile into tents in the so-called Tundra Zone to watch on TV. Some just keep on drinking. </p> <p>The Packers' status as the only community-owned professional team in America has been in place since five local businessmen - known as the Hungry Five - formed the Green Bay Football Corporation to rescue the team in 1921. This makes the Packers unique, an anomaly, and Cheeseheads are fanatical followers. 'I came alone and it cost me around $2,500,' says Michael, a nurse from Denmark. 'My wife's not too pleased, but what can you do?' </p> <p>The term Cheesehead was appropriated from fans in detested rival city Chicago, who taunted them about Wisconsin being America's dairy capital. In 1987 Ralph Bruno made the first cheddar hat and wore it to a baseball game between the Chicago White Sox and the Milwaukee Brewers, the team from down the road, and an official name for one of the most loyal tribes in sport was born. In Britain only Newcastle are, perhaps, comparable. Except the Packers are a slickly run organisation. And boasting a record 12 NFL championships, the team of Lambeau, legendary coach Vince Lombardi, on-field generals Bart Starr and Brett Favre, also know how to win - fans call their very modest home city Titletown, USA and are not laughed at. </p> <p>Then there are the Packers' 112,015 shareholders. Many are third or fourth generation, with no thought of selling. 'I bought them for my mom and when she died I had them framed,' says Tom Parker, a fan who has hired the 'same driveway we got last year to tailgate with 20 friends' on a nearby street. </p> <p>'It's a fairy tale type story,' says Starr, their great quarterback who was MVP in the Packers' Super Bowl wins in 1967 and 1968. 'How it occurred is amazing. Now it may be small, but in those days Green Bay was tiny.' </p> <p>The team was formed in 1919 by Lambeau and George Calhoun, the sports editor of the Green Bay Press-Gazette following a chance conversation on the street. Calhoun had followed Lambeau's football career as a high-school full-back and at Notre Dame University. During Christmas 1918 Lambeau caught tonsillitis and after six bedridden weeks decided to stay in Green Bay for the winter rather than return to college. Wanting to continue playing, Lambeau squeezed $500 from the Indian Packing Company, a local meat-packing business, for whom he worked as a clerk. </p> <p>Calhoun, meanwhile, advertised in the Gazette for players. Two years after forming, the Packers joined the American Professional Football Association, forerunner of the NFL, and in 1929 they won the first of their 12 championships. </p> <p>Calhoun, who also liked a beer - one tale tells of him quickly downing 18 from a 24-tin crate - served as the Packers' media man until 1947, publishing a weekly press release called the Dope Sheet, which was revived two years ago. Lambeau retired from playing in 1929, aged 32, but continued coaching the Packers for another 20 years and was one of the initial inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Lambeau was finally forced out in a power struggle in 1949. </p> <p>In 1923, 1935, 1950 and 1997, the Packers issued shares. 'Other NFL teams have one owner, we have the community,' says Packers president Mark Murphy. 'Forty-five directors are voted in and approved by the shareholders. An executive of seven run the business.' </p> <p>After Lambeau left the Packers, having won six NFL titles, that business became a decade of losing until Lombardi's arrival in 1959. 'I was drafted in 1956. We had a losing season that year, in '57 and '58. He immediately turned it around,' says Starr of a genius who became a head coach at the relatively late age of 45, yet would have the Super Bowl trophy named after him. </p> <p>When Lombardi retired in 1968 he had masterminded victory in Super Bowls I and II. The second was reached in an amazing game against the Dallas Cowboys on New Year's Eve 1967. </p> <p>Known as the Ice Bowl, it also gave Lambeau Field its Frozen Tundra nickname. 'You don't want to know how cold,' Starr says. 'Bitter. Unbelievably.' The official temperature, with wind chill, was a staggering -36F. Unsurprisingly, the undersoil heating failed. With Dallas leading 17-14, Starr, who says he still suffers frostbite, had driven the Packers from their 32-yard line to within inches of the Cowboys end zone when he called a time-out with 16 seconds left. </p> <p>Starr takes up the story. 'I ran to the sidelines and said to coach, \"There's nothing wrong with the running play. The problem is the backs are slipping. I'm upright so I can shuffle and lunge behind them.\" So help me God. At a crucial, cold time like this, all Vince Lombardi said was, \"Then run it and let's get the hell out of here.\" I was chuckling running back to the line.' </p> <p>Starr scored with the play to win the game. Victory over the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl II followed. But it would be 29 years until Favre inspired a third Packers' win of the Lombardi Trophy, renamed following the coach's premature death, aged 57, in 1970. When Favre's victorious team returned home, 200,000 Cheeseheads awaited. </p> <p>How much, then, of the future depends on that support? 'Many people own shares, but it's symbolic,' says Scott Schwartz, whose 'Game Day' book is signed by Cheeseheads from all over the world. 'We don't have much of a say.' </p> <p>A Packers source explains. 'The stock is basically a donation. The most recent sale in 1997 made around $100m - each share was $200 - and older ones were made worth 1,000 of the new issue, so a few whose families or businesses bought stock in the first sale have most voting power.' </p> <p>Yet other fans seem more than happy with their contribution. And while a further scheme would again rely on the goodwill of a local community where the average salary is $33,000, the Packers have invested elsewhere. </p> <p>There is a 30-year waiting list for the 166 luxury boxes installed during the 2003 face-lift. That also raised capacity to 72,928, while doing an admirable job of retaining the stadium's original 1950s style. Land around Lambeau Field has also been bought to develop. </p> <p>Next Sunday at Wembley, the New Orleans Saints 'host' the San Diego Chargers. This follows last year's first regular-season game played there, in which the New York Giants beat the Miami Dolphins. The NFL have begun a programme where each team will give up a home game in order to expand the sport worldwide and Packers officials are in full support, but it is clear the fans are not keen. 'We would not like it - to Europe, to Madison in Wisconsin, anywhere,' says lifelong Cheesehead Marty Hendricks. 'People build their fall weekend around games and tailgating with friends and family. And I don't think most fans care too much about the NFL going global.'</p> <p>\u2022 Sky Sports is broadcasting more than 125 live NFL games this season via its interactive coverage on Sky digital</p> <h2>Take your medicine: rugby doctors set the standard</h2> <p>So, American football fans think they are party animals? In which case, they really should hop across the Pond and take a look at English rugby union supporters if they want to see true professionals at work.</p> <p>Take Twickenham, where bountiful quantities of the finest wines, spirits and beers are sunk with unfathomable zeal in the West car park. Mind you, the patrons who frequent the most famous car park in sport would not be so vulgar as to use the word 'tailgating'.</p> <p>But it's not just the West car park that resembles a lake of alcohol on Twickenham match days. Wander around the bars or the nearby pubs, and you will see pint upon pint being downed more quickly than it takes Usain Bolt to run 100m. That said, Bolt probably does a better rendition of 'American Pie' and 'Sloop John B' than most England supporters.</p> <p>Then there is the annual Army v Royal Navy match at Twickenham, which regularly attracts more than 40,000 spectators, some of whom can barely put one foot in front of the other - and that's before they even arrive at the ground. Perhaps not surprising, given that they will have been availing themselves of copious amounts of the hard stuff since leaving their military bases in the early morning.</p> <p>But there is simply nothing to match the final of the United Hospitals Challenge Cup, the world's oldest rugby tournament, which takes place at Old Deer Park, the home of London Welsh, in early spring. Flour bombs and egg-throwing are not quite as prevalent as they once were, but some of the imbibing among the on-looking medical students knocks Twickenham's finest wreckers into a cocked hat.</p> <p>It is a sight to behold as some of the country's most eminent surgeons-in-waiting - a number of them swigging voraciously from rapidly emptying bottles of whisky, brandy and port - stagger around so helplessly, they are quite possibly unaware that a game of rugby is actually taking place. Now, those are party animals.</p> <p>'It is a bit tamer than it used to be,' says Terry Gibson, the president of the United Hospitals RFC. 'But there is still a party atmosphere, with a lot of jocular ragging and people enjoying themselves in the bar.' No kidding. <strong>Christopher Lyles</strong></p>",
  "<p>Italy's only black MP has warned of growing racism after a surge in attacks on immigrants across the country.</p> <p>'Immigrants are becoming the enemy,' said Jean-L\u00e9onard Touadi, 49, who was born in Congo and went to Italy in 1979. 'With an economic crisis under way, Italy has found a scapegoat to blame its woes on.'</p> <p>Touadi, a member of the opposition Values party, spoke out after a spate of assaults on immigrants. In Milan last month Abdul William Guibre, 19, originally from Burkina Faso, was beaten to death in an attack which made headlines across Italy. After accusing Guibre of stealing a packet of biscuits, a bar owner and his son called him a 'dirty black' and set on him with a metal pole.</p> <p>A Senegalese man selling handbags in a Milan street market was beaten with a baseball bat after stallholders reportedly accused him of 'stealing work from Italians'. Outside Naples, six African migrants were shot dead recently by the local mafia, while in Rome a Chinese immigrant was beaten up by boys as young as 15. A Somalian-born woman claimed that at Rome's Ciampino airport she was strip-searched and verbally abused when going through customs. The government's response to the alleged airport incident was swift. The Interior Minister, Roberto Maroni, said he would personally sue the woman for lying. 'Between her version and that of the police I would have no doubt about believing the police,' said Senate leader Maurizio Gasparri.</p> <p>The attacks have come as Italy begins to come to terms with a new generation of black Italians, born to African immigrants who began to arrive in greater numbers towards the end of the 1980s. Milan residents expressed astonishment to reporters when the young blacks who demonstrated after Guibre's murder shouted slogans in thick Milan accents.</p> <p>One emerging black Italian hero making a name in Milan is 18-year-old Mario Balotelli, tipped by many as a future star of the national football team. Born in Palermo to Ghanaian immigrants, Balotelli is on the books of Inter Milan, champions of Serie A, and is one of the first role models for black Italians. Last week he scored two goals for the Italian under-21 side in a 3-1 victory over Israel.</p> <p>'There are now Italians here with non-Italian horizons and this is our future,' said Touadi. For the MP, who forged a career in journalism and local politics in Rome before entering parliament this year, the rising number of incidents is linked to the increasingly strident tone of Maroni's party, the anti-immigrant Northern League, which is a linchpin in Silvio Berlusconi's governing coalition.</p> <p>'The League is pushing discrimination, separation and xenophobia and dragging the government, and with it Italy, towards the systematic violation of human rights,' he said, citing proposals tabled this month by the party which call for the expulsion of legal immigrants who commit a certain number of offences, restrictions on mixed marriages and a new obligation on doctors to report illegal immigrants in their care. Previous moves to expel vagrant Romanians and jail illegal immigrants were challenged last week by the EU.</p> <p>'For the League, the real problem is not illegal immigration, it's immigration. They need to stop while there is still time,' said Touadi. With legal immigrant numbers rising 17 per cent last year to 3.6 million, Touadi said the spectre of fascism was returning to haunt Italy. 'We've seen Rome taxi drivers chanting \"Duce, Duce\" at the town hall when the new right-wing mayor was elected this year and now fans with swastikas are following the national football team. Italy will need millions of immigrants to maintain its workforce if birth rates continue to be low, and entire sectors of the economy, like hotels and agriculture, would go under now without them, but the government prefers demagoguery.'</p> <p>For Touadi, Italians are being led astray by their leaders. 'Italians are better than this, starting from the Catholic tradition of giving support, to the constitution, which emerged from fascism to focus on individual rights, to Italy's own history of emigration.'</p> <p>The brutal murder of an Italian woman in a Rome back street last year, allegedly by a Romanian immigrant, sparked a backlash against immigrants. 'There has been an increase in crime by immigrants - to ignore that would be false political correctness,' said Touadi. 'But how can the government focus only on them when four regions in southern Italy are controlled by the mafia?'</p> <p>The mafia, in turn, has become an enthusiastic employer of illegal migrants, using them to sell pirated CDs, fake Prada bags and cocaine.</p> <p>Touradi said the demonstration for Guibre in Milan brought together second generation Italians from different origins and religions for the first time. </p> <p>'They will now look for a political role,' he said. 'Their voice enriches Italian culture.'</p> <p>Pushing Italy towards multiculturalism may not, however, win over Italy's politicians, he warned. 'After the 7/7 bombings in London, politicians claimed the UK was paying for being too tolerant.' </p> <p>For Touadi, a compromise is in order. 'We need to prevent communities becoming too isolated. In Rome we worked to stop Chinatown becoming wall-to-wall Chinese stores, leaving room for the old Roman shops like the bakery.'</p>",
  "<p>My cobnut tree provides catkins each spring - so charming in a jug on the kitchen table - and strong twigs to support the pea plants in summer (for centuries the supple branches have been used for hedging and hurdles), but I have yet to taste any of its fruits. Since my tree first sprouted clusters of frilly-leaved nuts seven years ago, the local squirrel population have had every last one. I would like to say I don't begrudge them their autumn feast, but I do. Hazels, especially milky young cobs and the longer filbert, are a great favourite, especially when roasted and dipped in bitter chocolate. </p> <p>The nuts have long been a sweetmeat - the Spanish use them in turron as the French do in nougat, the Turkish drop them into their delightfully gelatinous lokum and the Italians use them in panforte. We have long used them in brittle, those snappish sheets of melted sugar that shine like polished amber. Once you crush the nuts and sugar together, making what is more correctly termed praline, you have a warm-flavoured sweet shrapnel with which to flavour cakes, chocolate, biscuits and ice creams.</p> <p>Praline, normally made with almonds and sugar, is one of those infuriating bits of kitchen stuff that can work like a dream or end in tears. I find it is best left to work out its own future with as little tinkering from the cook as possible. I put the sugar in a thick-bottomed pan over a low to moderate heat and leave it there. Once it starts to melt around the edges, I gently shake the pan a little to move the unmelted sugar to the edges. I don't stir. A little patience, a watchful eye and the occasional shake will see the sugar become liquid caramel in 5-7 minutes. You then tip in the skinned and toasted nuts and pour the whole lot out on to a baking tray lightly smeared with oil. </p> <p>But it is salt that really brings out a hazelnut's flavour. If I am making a sheet of nuts set into sugar I often dust them with a pinch - never more - of crushed sea salt before I add them to the melted caramel. Then I dip the brittle into dark chocolate.</p> <p>Nuts and chocolate is one of autumn's sweetest pleasures. I always skin them first then roast till they are a deep and toasty brown. The flavour of a browned nut is three times more interesting once they have been toasted in a shallow pan or on a baking sheet under a grill. Last week I made a praline with hazels instead of the more usual almonds, crushed the mixture coarsely and stirred it into one of those overly rich chocolate truffle mixtures. We ate it in slices too thin to hold together, with tiny pointed Concorde pears that I had poached till on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>Pears and nuts, pears and chocolate, nuts and chocolate - whichever way you configure it, it is a marriage that works. Whether you turn the nuts into praline and scatter them over poached pears, or serve the fruit in halves, stuffed with cream and a drizzle of chocolate and nuts, you will be entering into something of a classic culinary partnership that is as timeless as it is delicious. </p> <h2>Chocolate praline truffle cake</h2> <p>A cake for serious chocolate fans only. I serve this in extremely thin slices. The cake needs something to offset its extraordinary richness. Raspberries work beautifully, as do the poached pears with vanilla seeds below. Makes about 8-10 slices.</p> <p><strong>For the praline:</strong></p> <p><strong>100g shelled, skinned hazelnuts</strong><br><strong>80g caster sugar</strong></p> <p><strong>For the truffle:</strong></p> <p><strong>350g dark chocolate </strong><br><strong>(about 70% cocoa solids)</strong><br><strong>170ml double cream</strong><br><strong>85g butter</strong><br><strong>a little cognac or rum or Frangelico</strong></p> <p>You will need a 20cm x 10cm loaf tin, lined with greaseproof paper or clingfilm, and a baking sheet, lightly oiled.</p> <p>To make the praline, put the shelled nuts in a shallow pan and toast over a moderate heat until they are fragrant and a deep, golden brown. (If your hazelnuts still have their brown skins on, rub the nuts vigorously in a tea towel until the skins flake off, then toast the nuts once more.)</p> <p>Put the sugar in a small, heavy-based saucepan (it will burn in a thin one), place over a low to moderate heat and allow the sugar to melt and slowly turn toffee coloured. This is not the time to be distracted. An occasional stir or shake is useful, but too much will prevent it from melting and cause the caramel to crystalise. Stir in the toasted nuts, leaving them to cook in the caramel for one minute.</p> <p>Lightly oil a baking tray. You can use groundnut oil, but I prefer hazelnut oil if there is some around. Tip the praline mixture on to the tray and leave to cool. Should any of the caramel have stuck stubbornly to the pan it can be removed with a little boiling water.</p> <p>To make the truffle mixture, snap the chocolate into pieces and melt in a small bowl resting on top of a pan of simmering ...#8594; ...#8592; water. Stir just once or twice, no more. The base of the bowl should not be low enough to touch the water. As soon as the chocolate has melted, switch off the heat. Gently stir in 2 tablespoons of hot water and leave be.</p> <p>Scrape the praline off the tray, put into a plastic bag and bash with a rolling pin. You could use a food processor if you prefer, but take care not to crush too finely. It should be the size of coarse gravel rather than fine grit. Uneven size lumps add to the interest.</p> <p>Whip the cream till it will stand in soft folds rather than stiff peaks. Beat the butter with a wooden spoon till soft and light then stir into the melted chocolate until the butter is melted. Fold in the cream and crushed praline. Now is the time to add the cognac, rum or Frangelico if you are using it. Spoon the mixture into the lined tin and smooth flat. Leave overnight in the fridge to set. (If you are impatient, you can probably get away with 3 or 4 hours.)</p> <p>When the cake has set, slide a warm knife down the sides of the tin and unmould on to a serving dish. Serve in thin slices with raspberries or, even better, the pears below. </p> <h2>Poached pears with vanilla</h2> <p>I have always preferred Comice (the portly pear) for poaching, but I recently used the smaller Concorde and was very pleased with the way it became deliciously tender while managing to keep its shape. Unusually, this variety keeps its colour once peeled, taking much longer than usual to brown. Serves 4.</p> <p><strong>90g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>800ml-1 litre of water </strong><br><strong>a little lemon juice</strong><br><strong>a vanilla pod</strong><br><strong>8 small pears</strong></p> <p>Dissolve the sugar in the water over a low heat with a good squeeze of lemon juice and the vanilla pod. I like to split the pod down its length so that some of the seeds come out into the liquid as the pears cook. </p> <p>Peel the pears, rubbing the lemon shell over them as you go. You can either keep them whole or cut them in half and remove their cores. The former is more elegant, the latter more practical. Slide the fruit into the syrup. With the pan partially covered, bring the syrup to the boil, then turn the heat down immediately. </p> <p>Let the pears simmer very gently until translucent and tender to the point of a knife. Depending on the ripeness of the fruit, this will take anything from 15 to 35 minutes, maybe longer. They really must be butter-soft if they are to be good.</p> <p>Let the pears cool in the syrup for a good hour, then lift them out and put them in a shallow dish in the fridge.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>I eat at Scott's probably two or three times a month. I love the ambience and the food. I come here with my wife sometimes and we order this seafood dish, which is like a mixed grill, and we just stuff ourselves with that. I love fish of any description, especially crayfish and lobsters. Anything from the sea - except crabs in New York. I ordered them there expecting a crab in a shell and they brought a whole crab and you eat the lot - legs, shells, everything. Ugh. I swapped dishes with my wife on that one. </p> <p>I grew up in Clydebank, one of seven children and my mother was a very good cook - which is why we are all such big, strapping people. We were very poor so she bought everything fresh. After Sunday dinner we would get ice cream. I love ice cream and my first business was selling it. Some people can taste champagne and say where it's from. I can usually taste ice cream and say who made it. It's hard to describe the taste, but good ice cream should always be smooth. Lyons, Walls and H\u00e4agen-Dazs all make good ice cream. Near my villa in France (my biggest extravagance) we always have one of those when we leave the restaurant and walk along the front. </p> <p>The thing I love about France is that we'll be sitting there at nine o'clock at night with the kids. It is so usual to take your kids to restaurants at night time, which is nice. I hate stuffy restaurants in France. I wouldn't go to the <br>restaurants in France that I normally go to in London. I like to walk into a restaurant and just be casual - wear my shorts, order something, have the kids with me and not worry about them asking for ketchup.</p> <p>The family home is in Stockton-on-Tees and I come down to London during the week for meetings and stay in my flat in Covent Garden. </p> <p>When I was in the navy I did boxing, so I was very fit - and because I was so fit, I'd eat anything. We'd go down and eat mess food. I didn't mind the food on board - they did ice cream and jelly, which was pretty regular and I quite enjoyed that. We very seldom ate on shore because you had to pay for it whereas on board it was free. But we drank a lot on shore. Now I eat out too much and I don't go to the gym enough.</p> <p>The most expensive meal I had was at The Ivy. I took my wife and my two eldest daughters and my second-eldest daughter had it in her head to order the most expensive starter (caviar), the most expensive main course and most expensive pudding on the menu, regardless of what they were, so the bill was quite high. I think a good meal in London now has got to be around 100 quid a head but I think that was knocking on \u00a3200 a head.</p> <p>I think celebrity is such an amazing thing - I mean, anybody can be a celebrity. Whether it's a chef, entrepreneur or businessman, everyone seems to want their moment of fame. I love doing Dragons' Den and I enjoy being in the limelight - it's great fun, a great team and I've made some serious money from it as well. I'm never going to retire. I'm going to keep doing this until the day before I go in the coffin because I love and enjoy it. But I don't want to die the richest man in town and I've set up my own charitable trust. I'm not going to die before doing something.</p> <p>\u2022 Duncan Bannatyne's Wake Up and Change Your Life is published by Orion, \u00a318.99.</p> <h2>Scott's 20 Mount Street, London W1 020 7495 7309 </h2> <p><strong>History</strong><br>Founded by fishmonger John Scott in 1851, Scott's was originally in Haymarket and moved to Mount Street in 1968.

  "<p>I often stop and think of Cher. Especially when I am preparing dinner. In the film Mermaids she plays a mother who only makes finger food, because anything else is too much of a commitment. Which is why I love finger food; which is why I imagined that tasting menus (lots of small plates of expensive bites) would be brilliant; which is why I found myself, sweating, groaning and penniless after a week of attempting to dine from them, exclusively. </p> <p>Tasting menus have been around since the 1970s, but became fashionable in the UK in 2005, around the time that chefs became properly famous. Famous enough for diners to trust their choices, and to pay handsomely for their experiments. High-price micro-course menus multiplied, with every restaurant that rated itself designing one. The most expensive tasting menu in the world is $466 at l'Arp\u00e8ge in Paris. Baby carrots picked in the morning are sent on the 10 o'clock high-speed train from Le Mans in time for lunch. For $437 you'll get five courses at Alain Ducasse's Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e - service is included. In London, Gordon Ramsay does seven courses for \u00a3120, and Jamie Oliver's Fifteen does a tasting menu for \u00a3100 with a different half-glass of wine for each course. The more I read, the more I got excited: tasting menus sound amazing. Like being at a posh vol au vents party but without the standing around making small talk to people you're scared of.</p> <p>I emailed my friend Alice details of the restaurant we'd be dining at: Texture, round the corner from Selfridges. She was half excited, and half gutted that it had photos of what she thought were test-tubes of saliva on the website. Alice isn't used to fine dining, poor thing. She perked up when Xavier, one of the restaurant's founders, brought us champagne cocktails and a bowl of bacon-flavoured popcorn. From now on I will always carry an unsmoked rasher to the cinema, because it was delicious. As were the crisps made from cod skin. Seriously: nice. Each plate needed two waiters - one to carry the plates (we chose one fish tasting menu, and one meat, at \u00a359 per person) and another to place them carefully in front of us, before explaining each of the course's components, pointing with a taut little finger. Some dishes came on plates, others on slates. Some had intricate smears of sauce, others had slices of veal tongue. Some came with a pipette of extra sauce, some came in vases of dry ice. We ate it all. Including, six courses later, a pair of Fisherman's Friend meringues. I took the bus home before midnight, 400 flavours mingling in my belly. </p> <p>Many, many hours later I was hungry again, and seated beside a stuffed tiger at Les Trois Gar\u00e7ons in east London (tasting menu, \u00a375 a head). The amuse bouche involved a shot of sweet potato soup. I downed it, and was instantly full. Of course though, I continued the eating. Scallops! Cracked crab! Glorious, glorious beef! I went to look at myself in the mirror after course three. Still there, if a bit hazy round the edges. At the veal sweetbreads plate I started to feel like I'd flown too close to the sun. At the Swiss cheese course I had to lay down my little knife. We met the chef, and in our inebriated, sated states, fell in love with him. We ate his assiette of desserts and a spoonful of muscat grape sorbet, and we left, eyes watering, swooning, but in a good way. </p> <p>My third tasting menu was at the Orrery. For \u00a397 (including a selection of wines) you get eight courses, including a pre-dessert - a shot of cr\u00e8me caramel - and then two real desserts, one of which has a blob of beer ice cream on the side. I danced in my seat at one point. Really, I did. </p> <p>I woke up on Saturday morning full of dread. Dread and beef. It wasn't just the food that had worn me down though, it was the accumulated anticipation. The excitement of all the cutlery changes, and the numerous plates, some of them square - it must be bad for the nerves to gasp so much. I learnt that it really is possible to get too much of a good, hilarious, luxurious thing, especially when it involves foie gras, pan-fried. I cancelled the rest of my tasting menu reservations, and had some cheese on toast at home. When I put it on the plate though, it didn't look quite edible. I cut it into the shape of a tiny star, turned it onto a photo frame and added a swoosh of Tabasco. Better. </p> <p>Texture, 34 Portman St, W1, 020 7224 0028; <br>Les Trois Gar\u00e7ons, 1 Club Row, E1, 020 7613 1924;<br>Orrery, 55 Marylebone High St, W1, 020 7616 8000.</p>",
  "<p>Some of private equity's most powerful tycoons, including Blackstone founder Steve Schwarzman, KKR's Henry Kravis and David Rubenstein of Carlyle Group, flew to Dubai last week to lure investors from the cash-rich Gulf states, it emerged this weekend.

  "<p><strong>What she watched:</strong></p> <p><strong>Britain's Got the Pop Factor and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice</strong>, C4</p> <p><strong>The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall</strong>, C4</p> <p><strong>Wired</strong>, ITV1</p> <p>I'd always thought of Peter Kay as more of a nod-and-a-winker than an arch-satirist but with last Sunday's <strong>Britain's Got the Pop Factor and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice</strong> (C4's biggest audience of the year at 5.5 million), he's probably now situated somewhere in the satirical pantheon between Alexander Pope and Chris Morris.</p> <p>Admittedly, Reality TV talent shows are easy to have a pop at but this really was pitch-perfect, and made me - oh yes - laugh out loud, which hurt because I've got a sore throat and sinuses like favela drains, but hey, it was such an amazing journey</p> <p>'The journey' is to reality TV what 'the naughty step' is to Supernanny, 'fuck' is to Gordon Ramsay and 'credit crunch' is to Robert Peston, with no reality contestant allowed to escape its gruelling demands. Even if they turn up at the auditions theoretically to sing, most wannabes are sufficiently clued-up to bring (along with the Thermos and sandwiches) a bit of a back-story. </p> <p>This is not so much about impressing the judges as wowing the producers, who care considerably less about singing than they do about wringing every last viewer dry of tears.</p> <p>Thus Peter Kay gave us R Wayne (Our Wayne), who was evicted from bootcamp for not being interesting enough but immediately reinstated by Pete Waterman on compassionate grounds when Wayne's grandmother had a heart attack on hearing he'd been dumped from the show. Perfect. As were the almost uncannily plausible 2 Up, 2 Down, a group comprised of two couples, with both the women in wheelchairs.</p> <p>The auditions were fantastic: 'Two dwarves, two donkeys - it's like a Saturday night at Simon Cowell's,' deadpanned judge Dr Fox, thus going some way towards rehabilitating himself several years after famously declaring that 'paedophiles have more genes in common with crabs than they do with you or me ...' on Chris Morris's Brass Eye</p> <p>But the best bits were the finalists' absurd medleys - particularly Peter Kay-as-Geraldine's priceless segue from Springsteen's 'Born to Run' to 'Born Free' to 'Free Nelson Mandela' to Rihanna's 'Umbrella' (ella-ella-ella) - while the sight of Paul McCartney 'mentoring' Geraldine's renditions of TV themes, suggesting Home and Away might be preferable to Blankety Blank ('Paul had his heart set on something more romantic') was priceless, clearing my sinuses faster than Sudafed.</p> <p>The last time I cared about the charts was in about 1988 but I very much hope Geraldine's 'Winners Song' - a gloriously anodyne ballad, all the better for having been written by Gary Barlow - beats Leon to the number one spot this week, if only for the sake of the poor crippled pole-dancers.</p> <p>And thank you, Channel 4, for being kind enough to give us televisual yin and yang in the same week. After Britain's Got the Pop Factor, watching <strong>The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall</strong> made a bizarrely beautiful double-bill. I laughed, then I cried, then I craughed.</p> <p>Gaza, 2003, and a young photo-journalism student on his first visit to the area is shot in the head while saving Palestinian children from Israeli fire. Cut to a busy house in London, where Thomas Hurndall's family, not knowing he was in Gaza, learn he is in a coma in an Israeli hospital after working with the International Solidarity Movement, a non-violent Palestinian protest group. This is a very British, stoical, middle-class family, not the sort to veg out on a sofa on Saturday nights, immersing themselves in the Battle of the Journeys. They are the kind who get on with stuff unfussily, keeping their emotions on the back-burner.</p> <p>Kerry Fox and Stephen Dillane, as Hurndall's divorced parents Jocelyn and Anthony, were stupendously good, sorting stuff out, quietly, efficiently, united in grief but dealing with it separately. For a drama-doc, there was a great deal more doc than drama; no histrionics, lots of facts and an even-handed attempt to humanise the Israeli-Arab Bedouin sniper who shot Hurndall and who, eventually - after the initial whitewash by the Israeli Defence Forces was thrown out in favour of an independent inquiry - received an eight year sentence for manslaughter. This didn't sound much until one learned that this was more than four times longer than any previous sentence for an equivalent crime.</p> <p>The power of the film lay in its resolutely low-key stoicism. Anthony Hurndall may have been emotionally uptight but that made it all the more moving when he unravelled. In front of his ex-wife and the limp body of his comatose son, he declared: 'When I heard the news, I thought, Tom, if you're gonna go, I couldn't think of a better way for you to go than in an act of great compassion, bravery and humanity. And I couldn't be more bloody proud of you.' His upper lip trembled, Jocelyn gave a small tight smile, and the moment passed. 'Gotta go back to the office,' he said, turning on his heel.</p> <p>The only concession to drama was a series of flashbacks to the day Hurndall left home for the Middle East against his mother's wishes. This was played out several times, in increasingly lengthy shots, so that by the end we knew they had parted uncomfortably, Jocelyn turning her back on her son, he slamming the door and thus missing hearing her final, pleading 'Tom'. This was a beautifully played start to the emotional journey every parent dreads. I shivered, then decided to bloody well not cry, all right?</p> <p>Happy days - at least professionally - for Jodie Whittaker, who, fresh from an appearance in Tess of D's, last week played both Thomas Hurndall's grieving sister, Sophie, and hapless Louise, who has been sucked into Laurence Fox's big bank fraud in ITV1's pacy, convoluted and timely three-parter <strong>Wired</strong>. Young Whittaker is good at looking scared, angry, embarrassed, nervous and any number of other actorly emotions but I'm afraid she's a bit rubbish at playing mum to her daughter, Erica. In episode one she didn't touch her, much less hug her, just shouted at her to go to bed, or told her to write down the registration of the car whose driver may or may not be about to abduct mummy. Most of the time Erica looked at Louise as she might at the babysitter who suggests staying up and doing a few vodka shots before watching something cool on TV, like, uh, Dexter</p> <p>If Louise gets out of this alive she may want to take a different approach to the maternal journey but meanwhile, bring on the fraud. Call me perverse but I'm in the mood for seeing a bank brought to its knees and begging for mercy, though I do hope Louise is forsaking an Isa and keeping her bung in readies, under the mattress.</p> <h2>The Palais<br>Memory Lane, W6</h2> <p>In desperation, I recently turned to Facebook to ask whether the Clash first played the Hammersmith Palais in 1979 or 1980 . I was there (it was great) but I couldn't recall the date, having discovered that the 'archive' of papery ephemera I've been carting around for nearly 30 years had mysteriously vaporised. The subsequent correspondence was entertaining but the question remained unanswered. </p> <p>Until last week and the repeat of BBC4's Last Man in Hammersmith Palais, in which Suggs narrated a charming history of the former skating rink with the first sprung dancefloor in Europe, visited by everybody from Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford to Charles and Diana, with the acme of glamour presumably being Elton's 50th birthday party in 1997. From Dixieland to dub, swing, disco and bhangra, the Palais - thanks in part to the Clash's 'White Man...' and Ian Dury's 'Reasons to Be Cheerful, Pt 3' ('Hammersmith Palais, the Bolshoi Ballet ...') - was, according to the film's talking heads, always more than just another venue, until it closed last year. Oh, and thanks to Mick Jones for finally answering the question: 1980, apparently - though I still need the exact date ...</p>",
  "<h2>Favourite UK city: Edinburgh</h2> <h2>Why go now?</h2> <p>To miss the crowds. The Scottish capital is packed in August and again over Christmas and New Year, so the autumn lull is a better time to visit if you don't relish being elbowed off the pavements. Edinburgh's brooding, storybook architecture is at its most atmospheric during the darkening autumn evenings and the days are often crisp and sunny before the damp winter gloom of February and March takes over. A little later, on 27 November, 'Edinburgh's Christmas' sets up stall in Princes Street Gardens with a ferris wheel, ice rink and, new this year, a Spiegeltent (<a href=\"http://www.edinburghschristmas.com\">www.edinburghschristmas.com</a>).</p> <h2>Checking in</h2> <p>With <strong>Hotel Missoni's</strong> first British venture opening in March (<a href=\"http://www.hotelmissoni.com\">www.hotelmissoni.com</a>) and a <strong>Hotel du Vin </strong>launching in December (<a href=\"http://www.hotelduvin.com\">www.hotelduvin.com</a>), the competition to provide Edinburgh's coolest beds is hotting up. In the meantime, <strong>Tigerlily</strong> remains Edinburgh's most convincing boutique hotel, with boldly decorated but unpretentious doubles starting from \u00a3125, B&amp;B (125 George Street, 0131 225 5005; <a href=\"http://www.tigerlilyedinburgh.co.uk\">www.tigerlilyedinburgh.co.uk</a>). Avoid its underwhelming restaurant, though. A few doors down, the <strong>George Hotel</strong> has just opened a swish new extension. Doubles start from \u00a3109, room only (19 George Street, 0131 225 1251; <a href=\"http://www.principal-hotels.com\">www.principal-hotels.com</a>). Less pricey options include 24 Saxe-Coburg Place, where smart doubles start at \u00a370, B&amp;B (0131 315 3263; <a href=\"http://www.saxecoburgplace.co.uk\">www.saxecoburgplace.co.uk</a>), and <strong>Edinburgh Central Youth Hostel</strong>, where en-suite twins cost from \u00a337, room only (9 Haddington Place, 0131 524 2090; <a href=\"http://www.edinburghcentral.org\">www.edinburghcentral.org</a>).</p> <h2>Hit the street</h2> <p>If breakfast isn't included with your bed, start the day by fuelling up on porridge laced with raspberries, cream and sugar from <strong>Stoats Porridge Bar</strong> at Castle Terrace farmers' market (9am- 2pm every Saturday). Then, head uphill, skirting Edinburgh Castle, to zigzag down the Royal Mile and gawp at Holyrood Palace. If you're feeling energetic, stride up Arthur's Seat, an extinct volcano, or book a sightseeing trip (\u00a315) with recumbent bike specialists <strong>Laid Back Bikes</strong> (0131 226 4683; <a href=\"http://www.laid-back-bikes.co.uk\">www.laid-back-bikes.co.uk</a>). To delve deeper into the city's history, take a guided tour (\u00a310pp) of the ancient underground streets around Mary King's Close (2 Warriston's Close, 08702 430160; <a href=\"http://www.realmarykingsclose.com\">www.realmarykingsclose.com</a>).</p> <h2>Coffee break</h2> <p>The Swedes are all but taking over Edinburgh. <strong>Joseph Pearce's</strong> is the latest of a number of Edinburgh caf\u00e9-bars run by a couple of friendly Swedish expats.

Then there's <strong>Peter's Yard</strong>, a slick Swedish artisan bakery and caf\u00e9 over in the city's new Quartermile development (27 Simpson Loan, 0131 228 5876; <a href=\"http://www.petersyard.com\">www.petersyard.com</a>). </p> <h2>Neighbourhood watch</h2> <p>Village-like Stockbridge, at the base of the New Town, is full of character and quirky independent shops such as <strong>The Store</strong> farm shop (13 Comely Bank Road, 0131 315 0030; <a href=\"http://www.thestorecompany.co.uk\">www.thestorecompany.co.uk</a>), <strong>Diana Forrester</strong> homewares (22 North West Circus Place, 0131 225 5877; <a href=\"http://www.dianaforrester.co.uk\">www.dianaforrester.co.uk</a>), <strong>Iain Mellis</strong> cheese (0131 225 6566, 6 Baker's Place) and <strong>Chandlers</strong> for enamel pots and pans (68 St Stephen's Street, 0131 220 5472;<a href=\"http://www.chandlersonline.com\"> www.chandlersonline.com</a>). It's also home to <strong>Zanzero </strong>(14-16 North West Circus Place, 0131 220 0333; <a href=\"http://www.zanzero.com\">www.zanzero.com</a>), a breezy Italian restaurant that's the latest venture from the family behind Edinburgh's famous <strong>Valvona &amp; Crolla </strong>deli. Nearby Ann Street has some of the loveliest Georgian architecture in the city while the 'stock bridge' itself (by a branch of Pizza Express) marks the entrance to a leafy path along the Water of Leith - a gentle 20-minute stroll takes you through quirky Dean Village to the <strong>Gallery of Modern Art</strong>.</p> <h2>Retail therapy</h2> <p>George Street is the city's most prestigious shopping street. St Andrew's Square, at its eastern end, is home to an Edinburgh branch of Harvey Nichols though local fashionistas opt for <strong>Jane Davidson</strong> (52 Thistle Street, 0131 225 3280; <a href=\"http://www.janedavidson.co.uk\">www.janedavidson.co.uk</a>). Victoria Street is reliable souvenir-hunting territory, with posh Scottish interiors shop <strong>Anta</strong>, 'liquid deli' <strong>DemiJohn</strong>, <strong>Totty Rocks</strong> boutique and a run of offbeat art and clothing stores.

  "<p>It must have been sometime in 1979, or maybe 1980, when I saw Freddie Toal on the evening news. I remember that I was sitting in the living room of a flat in Kensal Rise, north London with some friends, when someone shouted out his name and I looked up and there he was, bedraggled and barely recognisable; a lad from home. </p> <p>He was not someone I knew very well, but I distinctly remembered him from the early years of the Troubles when we had both been involved in the rioting that was part of daily life in the Nationalist areas of Armagh. Back then, Freddie Toal had longish black hair and wore the young, working class uniform of denim jacket and jeans. On the news that night, though, he was wearing only a blanket, and was standing in a cell in the Maze prison. His hair was long, his face gaunt and the walls around him were smeared with his own excrement. He looked familiar but utterly altered.</p> <p>'For a long time, when I was on the blanket, I had no real idea what I looked like,' he says, some 30 years later, his long hair now gone, his speech quiet and measured. 'The only time I ever saw my face was this one time when the screws were sweeping piss into our cells. The sun suddenly shone through the window and, for a few seconds, I saw my reflection in a pool of piss. It sounds funny but it took me a while to register it was me. I looked like a wild man.'</p> <p>In Steve McQueen's much anticipated film, Hunger, which opens at the end of the month, there is a scene that must surely have been based on that image: two young men, scared but defiant, standing in a shit-smeared cell. It is powerful but not nearly as haunting as the footage that inspired it. The film tells the story of Bobby Sands, the leader of the IRA hunger strike of 1981, and the most iconic Republican figure to emerge out of the Troubles. It does not tell the whole story though, ending instead at the moment of Sands's death. The nine men who followed his example are mentioned only in a footnote. The mass protest that attended their deaths is never alluded to, nor the murderous violence that occurred across the already beleaguered province at the time.</p> <p>Both Freddie Toal and his close friend, Sean McGerrigan, were in the Maze prison at the same time as Bobby Sands. Having seen the film, I wanted to hear their story. We arranged to meet in a community centre near the Roman Catholic cathedral in Armagh, the town that we all grew up in and where, to varying degrees, we were politicised by the early years of the Troubles. I never graduated beyond the rioting stage, though, nor did I embrace hardcore Republicanism. I guess I was too interested in girls and rock music, and could not wait to leave Armagh. And, besides, I was scared of guns, and of those that wielded them. Back then, the Brits - and the RUC - were the enemy but I did not hate them enough to even think about killing them. Nor did I really believe in dying for Ireland; it just did not enter my mind.</p> <p>At that time, you only found out for certain who was 'involved' when they were 'lifted' by the British army in a dawn raid, or went 'on the run' across the border, or, in some cases, were shot dead while on what the IRA called 'active service'. Freddie Toal was 20 when he was arrested on a dawn raid in 1977. He was subsequently charged with, as he casually puts it, 'possession of rifles and carrying out some knee-cappings in the town'. Sean McGerrigan followed him into the H Blocks the following year. He was just 17 when he was 'lifted' from his family house in nearby Callan Street in 1978; he was subsequently charged with attempted murder and possession of firearms. </p> <p>In a way, his arrest was not that surprising. His brother, Peter McGerrigan, whom everyone knew by his nickname, Jake, was shot dead by a single bullet fired by a British soldier on the Windmill Hill housing estate in 1973. He was the first IRA volunteer to be killed by the British army in Armagh. He was just 18 years old. 'Jake McGerrigan was the year above me in school,' remembers Freddie Toal. 'He was the first of my generation to die fighting for Ireland. At his wake, I knew I had to avenge his death. The first thing I did was join the Fianna \u00c9ireann [Young IRA]. Before that, I just rioted and threw stones, but then I wanted the gun. If you had told me back then, at 17, what was ahead of me, I would not have believed you.'</p> <p>The blanket protest was already under way when he entered the H Blocks in January 1977, and he went straight on it. In 1976 the British government had decided to phase out special category status for convicted terrorists as part of a bigger process known as 'criminalisation'. Both Republican and Loyalist prisoners, who had until then been granted special category status, were now to be treated as common criminals. The protest began on 14 September 1976, when Kieran Nugent, the first IRA man to be convicted for terrorist offences under the new policy, reputedly said to a prison guard: 'If you want me to wear that uniform, you're going to have to nail it to my back.' He was given a blanket and escorted to his cell. Other IRA prisoners followed his example, and in 1978 the mass blanket protest turned into the dirty protest when IRA prisoners refused to leave their cells following another violent dispute, this time over a demand for extra towels in the communal washrooms. The prisoners' policy of non-cooperation meant that they were often confined for days on end in their tiny concrete cells with just a blanket, a mattress and a Bible. Refusing to wash or slop out, they began emptying their urine out over the floor and smearing their excrement on the walls.</p> <p>Another emotive scene in Hunger shows two prisoners sleeping on dirty mattresses while maggots wriggle in the mounds of rotting food and excrement that have been pushed into the corners. Was it, I ask Toal, who remained on the blanket for four years, really that bad? 'It was worse,' he says. 'For years afterwards I had nightmares about it. I'd wake up drenched in sweat, thinking I was back there.' </p> <p>Back then, the most vivid description of their conditions came from Cardinal O'Fiaich, the then-Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland, who visited the prison in 1978. 'I was shocked by the inhuman conditions prevailing in H Blocks 3, 4 and 5, where over 300 prisoners are incarcerated,' he said. 'One would hardly allow an animal to remain in such conditions let alone a human being.' O'Fiaich compared the H Blocks to 'the slums of Calcutta', adding: 'The stench and filth in some of the cells, with the remains of rotten food and human excreta around the walls, was almost unbearable. In two of them I was unable to speak for fear of vomiting.'</p> <p>His public statement prompted a response from the Northern Ireland Office, which began: 'These criminals are totally responsible for the situation in which they find themselves. It is they who have been smearing excreta on the walls and pouring urine through the cell doors. It is they who by their actions are denying themselves the excellent modern facilities of the prison.' </p> <p>The conflicting tone and message of those two statements, the one emotive and outraged, the other detached and clinical, prefigured the coming battle of wills between Republicans and the British state. In the eyes of the British government, led by Margaret Thatcher, the prisoners were simply murderers and gangsters and were to be treated accordingly. To the Nationalist population of Northern Ireland, who were becoming increasingly agitated about conditions inside the H Blocks, they were political prisoners standing up for a defining principle of Republicanism. To complicate matters further, word was filtering out of the Maze about the often violent ill treatment of the Republican Catholic prisoners by their mainly Loyalist Protestant prison officers.</p> <p>Toal and McGerrigan also talk quite calmly about the beatings they say they received 'on a regular basis' from their mainly Loyalist prison officers. They often occurred, they say, when they were being returned to their cells after Sunday Mass, or after a visit from someone on the outside.</p> <p>The IRA leadership inside the prison communicated with their counterparts on the outside through 'comms', tiny rolled up pieces of paper inscribed with minuscule writing that were secreted in prisoner's mouths, anuses, or underneath their foreskins. Toal describes how he was often 'grabbed by my hands and feet by four screws and spread over a mirror on the floor like a chicken, while a so-called medical officer officer stuck his fingers inside my ass.'</p> <p>Did they ever feel like giving in, abandoning their protest? 'What you have to understand was there was incredible camaraderie in there,' says McGerrigan. 'You always took strength from the fact that there were so many men on the protest. After a beating, the prisoners would often start singing Republican songs though the doors just to do the screws' heads in.' Toal concurs, though at times he has a haunted look when he talks about his experiences. 'It never entered my head to give up but I was always afraid of breaking under the beatings. You always had to be strong, not show weakness, keep your principles.'</p> <p>They tell me there were some 'decent screws' but that most of them were, as McGerrigan puts it, 'just plain sectarian'. One senior prison officer in the Maze at that time was a man called Paddy Joe Kerr, one of the few Catholics in the Northern Ireland Prison Service. He grew up close to where Sean McGerrigan did, and joined the prison service before the Troubles started. 'He had the power to stop the beatings but he never did,' says Toal. 'He was systemised against us,' adds McGerrigan. In 1985 Paddy Joe Kerr was shot dead by the IRA on the steps of Armagh cathedral as he and his young son were leaving Sunday Mass. </p> <p>By 1980 there were over 400 IRA prisoners on the blanket in the Maze and in Armagh women's prison. Their conditions and harsh treatment had now become a major focus of protest. More chillingly, the IRA had responded to the brutality inside the prison by targeting prison officers on the outside. By January of that year, 18 had been killed. As the dirty protest dragged on, and morale among the beleaguered prisoners began to waver, certain influential IRA men inside the H Blocks began to put pressure on the Army Council on the outside to be allowed to use the most extreme tactic of all: a hunger strike. </p> <p>The hunger striker has an almost mythological status in the annals of Irish Republicanism. Before 1981 the most celebrated hunger striker was Terence McSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork, who died in Brixton prison in 1920 after 74 days. One part of his inaugural speech could just as easily have described the Republican mindset half a century later: 'The contest on our side is not one of rivalry or vengeance, but of endurance. It is not those who can inflict the most but those who can suffer the most who will conquer.' </p> <p>On 27 October 1980 the first IRA hunger strike inside the H Blocks began. It ended in confusion on 18 December in what the Irish writer and historian Tim Pat Coogan called 'a burst of prison poker, which the authorities at first believed they had won'. No lives were lost but Republican prisoners realised quickly that they had been outplayed, and that none of their demands for special category status had been met. In November the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, had spelt out the British government's stance: 'Let me make one point about the hunger strike in the Maze Prison. I want this to be utterly clear. There can be no political justification for murder or any other crime. The government will never concede political status to the hunger strikers or to any others convicted of a criminal offence in the province.' The stage was set for the second and final round of what would be a bloody and protracted battle, and one in which Thatcher would face someone even more intransigent than herself. </p> <p>Freddie Toal recalls the moment he met Bobby Sands. 'It was 18 December 1980, the day the first hunger strike ended. He came into our cell. I remember he was stroking his beard as he spoke and you could see by the look of him that he was shattered. There were screws behind him so he spoke in Irish. He just said \"Ni bhfuair faic\" (\"We got nothing\"). Then he told us that there was going to be another hunger strike, and this time it would be to the end. He said: \"I will lead it, and I will die.\" That was the last thing he said to us.'</p> <p>The second IRA hunger strike, which began on 1 March 1981, was planned by Sands to develop in ever more dramatic stages, one man following another to his death. Sands himself was the first to die after 66 days without food. By then he had become a British MP, having famously taken the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat on 9 April 1981. In death he became, for a time at least, an icon. An estimated 100,000 people attended his funeral in Belfast on 5 May, streets were named after him in Paris and Tehran, and according to Tim Pat Coogan: 'The French government offered the Dublin government two gestures of solidarity, which Dublin declined. One was to boycott the British royal wedding, the other that President Mitterrand attend Bobby Sands's funeral.' </p> <p>Another nine IRA prisoners would starve themselves to death before the hunger strike was called off in October 1981. In the tense seven months it lasted, violence in Northern Ireland reached a pitch that recalled the dark days of the early Seventies: 61 people died, over half of them civilians, including a girl of 11 hit by a plastic bullet; 30 members of the security forces were killed by the IRA.</p> <p>I went home to Armagh for a short family visit in the late summer of 1981, and I can still remember the mood of dread, anger and simmering violence that seemed to have taken hold of the place. In a bar frequented by middle-class Catholics, school teachers, doctors and the like, I heard a collective hiss of pure hatred turn into a tumult of abuse when Margaret Thatcher appeared on the television in the corner. There was a cheer when the bar manager reached up and switched channels. Thatcher, it seemed, had galvanised the Catholic middle classes into voting for Sinn F\u00e9in. They have continued to do so, in ever-increasing numbers, ever since. </p> <p>Before the hunger strike, Sands had collected the names of over 70 IRA men who were prepared to fast until death. I ask Toal and McGerrigan if either of them considered putting their names forward. 'No, never,' replies McGerrigan. Freddie Toal just shakes his head. </p> <p>The following day I travelled up to Belfast to meet a man who did volunteer for the IRA hunger strike. His name is Pat Sheehan. He spent 55 days without food, and was approaching death when the hunger strike was called off, mainly because of intervention from relatives of the starving men. Sheehan is currently, he says, 'self-employed', and lives in a well-off, middle-class neighbourhood on the outskirts of west Belfast. He has a degree in philosophy, obtained while in the Maze Prison. The night before, he had watched Hunger, and was eager to talk about what he called 'the weird mixture of feelings it brought up'. </p> <p>Did the film, I ask, chime with his experiences of the H Blocks at that time? 'Most of the time, it did. The camaraderie was missing, though. But everything else was pretty accurate, the conditions, the beatings, the grimness of the blocks. It brought it all back.' </p> <p>Sheehan was arrested in February 1978 and charged with causing an explosion in the centre of Belfast. He received a 15-year sentence and moved to the H Blocks in March 1979. 'You were given a blanket and you went down to your wing,' he says, smiling at the memory. 'I was feeling apprehensive, a bit scared, and half expecting a beating from the screws as a welcome. It seemed very quiet, then I heard someone shout in Irish, \"New man on the block!\" and all hell broke loose. There was cheering and shouting and men banging the pisspots on the doors. I thought, the morale is high, the lads aren't cowed. It was,' he says, grinning, 'like walking out on to Croke Park to play for your county in an All-Ireland Final.' </p> <p>Sheehan said he put his name down for both IRA hunger strikes 'without hesitation'. He agrees now that this was 'a brutal thing to do' to his family. 'Absolutely, absolutely,' he says, nodding, 'but the thing was, and this came across in the film, we were absolutely focused. You had to be. So that nothing could deflect you.'</p> <p>When his parents and his older sister came to visit him, he waited for the right moment to break the news to his father. Instead, his father broke some bad news to him. 'He hung back after the others left, and whispered to me that my sister had just been diagnosed with leukemia and given five years to live. Looking back on it now,' he says, quietly, 'it might seem very callous of me to have gone ahead with a hunger strike in those circumstances, to take that decision when they were going through this awful moment. But I had made up my mind. I could not let the other men down.' </p> <p>How did his family react to his decision? 'They were devastated. Absolutely devastated. I can still remember the look on their faces when I told them. It was a terrible thing to see.' He says that his father 'became politicised during the hunger strike even though he was anti-violence to the day he died'. </p> <p>Nine men had already died when Sheehan began his hunger strike, and the 10th, Mickey Devine, died soon afterwards. 'In a way, you couldn't let their deaths affect you too much. I wasn't surprised when Bobby [Sands] died because we all knew he was going to go the whole way. It was more the inevitability of it that was terrible, but we stayed strong because we had to.'</p> <p>Was there a moment during his own hunger strike when he had any doubts about his decision? He thinks for a moment. 'Well, I was going into uncharted territory, so of course I had some doubts. Would I be able to carry it through to the end? I was as sure as I could be but, strangely enough, as time went on and I grew weaker physically, I became stronger psychologically until there was no doubt in my mind. Day by day, I became more certain.'</p> <p>Sheehan talks with remarkably little emotion of what he went through in the 55 days he inched closer to death. He says the worst part was 'the terrible realisation that you were not just feeling sick but becoming seriously ill, your own body rebelling against you'. In the last few days of his ordeal, he says, he was 'still lucid and very, very calm' but could only 'see shadowy, ghostly figures coming in and out of the room'. One of them was a doctor, who told him that even if he ended his fast, he would be permanently damaged and, in fact, might not even live. </p> <p>He tells me proudly that he has 'no lasting effects' from the hunger strike, and, in fact, 'recovered remarkably quickly'. In this, he is the exception: other surviving hunger strikers have had severe problems, usually with their eyesight and kidney function. Sheehan was 'almost totally blind' and 'lapsing in and out of unconsciousness' when the hunger strike was called off. A priest had granted him absolution, given him Communion, and performed the Last Rites over his bed. </p> <p>Can he describe how it felt to be pulled back from the brink of death? He sighs and shakes his head. 'To be honest, I had mixed emotions. On a purely personal level, I was glad that I had survived, but on another level I have to say I felt somehow disappointed, especially as the days went by and I received medical attention and started to recover. I think I had what is called survivor's syndrome. I felt guilty, definitely, about the lads who had died, about their families. And, in terms of the bigger political picture, I felt that stopping the hunger strike would demoralise and undermine the whole struggle.' </p> <p>The year after the hunger strike ended was, according to Sheehan, 'the most demoralising time for Republican prisoners'. Both Toal and McGerrigan had said the same thing. The following year, though, the prisoners had achieved all their aims, and more besides. Segregated from their Loyalist counterparts, and wearing their own clothes, they effectively ran the prison. 'When I was brought into prison in 1990,' the Republican activist and author Danny Morrison told me recently, 'a prison officer asked me if I had everything I needed. Then he said goodnight to me in Irish. Mad!'</p> <p>Why then, one has to ask, did those 10 men die? In one way, as Steve McQueen remarked recently: 'It was as if the whole history of the Troubles, and of Britain's relationship to Ireland, was distilled in that moment. It came down to two opposing and immovable forces: Margaret Thatcher and Bobby Sands.' Morrison, who was an envoy between the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership and the prisoners in 1981, concurs. 'I remember saying to Bobby, Thatcher will not back down. I came away knowing that his mind was set, too, though. He knew what he had to do and how it would end.' </p> <p>'Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart', wrote WB Yeats in his poem, 'Easter, 1916', about the death by execution of Irish Republicanism's founding heroes, among them P\u00e1draig Pearse, whose belief in blood sacrifice and martyrdom seemed at the heart of the IRA hunger strike of 1981. In retrospect, though, the tumultuous events of that time and in particular the election of Bobby Sands, can be viewed as a pivotal moment in Republican thinking, when Pearse's dark ideology reached its terrible crescendo then finally faded. It was the moment when, to paraphrase Danny Morrison, belief in the ballot box began to replace belief in the bullet. Everything that has happened since, including the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn F\u00e9in members taking their places in the Northern Irish Assembly as democratically elected representatives, has emerged out of that terrible summer of 1981. </p> <p>'Things change very slowly,' says Sean McGerrigan, 'and not in the way you expect. People might say that those men died in vain, but they died as part of a greater struggle. There will be a United Ireland but not in the way we envisaged it happening years ago.' </p> <p>Freddie Toal nods his consent. 'It was inevitable what happened,' he says. 'The environment we grew up in politicised us, and the H Blocks politicised us even more deeply. And if you came though what we did on the H Blocks, you have a special bond with the other men who did the same. Maybe it's hard for you to relate to that, just as it is hard to understand why we had to take up the gun, or why someone would choose to starve themselves to death for a principle.' </p> <p>He is right, of course. I have not been through what they have been through. And, despite our shared upbringing, and all that has happened since, I still do not fully understand what drove them to take up the gun or fuelled their monumental endurance, their unshakeable certainty. Nor, though, can I understand why, whatever their reasons for being imprisoned, they were treated in captivity as if they were less than human. Perhaps that is the unanswered question that still echoes most loudly, and alarmingly, in our fragile democracy in these still troubled times. </p> <h2>The toll - Hunger's strike dead</h2> <p><strong>Bobby Sands, aged 27 </strong><br>1 March-5 May 1981 (66 days on strike)</p> <p><strong>Francis Hughes, 25 </strong><br>15 March-12 May (59 days)</p> <p><strong>Raymond McCreesh, 24</strong><br>22 March-21 May (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Patsy O'Hara, 23</strong><br>22 March-21 May (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Joe McDonnell, 29</strong><br>9 May-8 July (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Martin Hurson, 24 </strong><br>28 May-13 July (46 days)</p> <p><strong>Kevin Lynch, 25</strong><br>23 May-1 August (71 days)</p> <p><strong>Kieran Doherty, 25</strong><br>22 May-2 August (73 days)</p> <p><strong>Thomas McElwee, 23</strong><br>8 June-8 August (62 days)</p> <p><strong>Michael Devine, 27</strong><br>22 June-20 August (60 days)</p> <h2>Northern Ireland - a history of protest</h2> <p><strong>1965</strong> The Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland meet for talks, a move which provokes tension among Unionists. </p> <p><strong>1966 </strong>Loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) forms in response to the perceived revival of the IRA, on whom they declare war.</p> <p><strong>1968</strong> Protests by the newly formed Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) descend into violence with loyalists attacking demonstrators.</p> <p><strong>1969</strong> <strong>12 August</strong> Simmering tensions erupt during the Battle of the Bogside which sees violent confrontations in Londonderry between police and nationalists and lasts three days.

Slowly, traditional instincts of left and right are reasserting themselves.</p> <p>'Politics becomes more important now - not in a partisan, point-scoring way but because the way in which you deal with the crisis does depend on your values. If you have got to respond quickly, you go with your core instinct,' says Cooper.</p> <p>'When your back's against the wall, Labour values become more important. The idea that you just leave people to sink or swim, that you abandon people to their fate in the way I think the Tories did to constituencies like mine in the Eighties, just feels so wrong and irresponsible and unfair when people are being hit by forces completely beyond their control.'</p> <p>Cameron, meanwhile, argues that classic Tory values of thrift and enterprise fit the new zeitgeist better. But both recognise that this is a battle of values, not economics: and the party bonding most plausibly with the overstretched couple who can't remortgage, the small business ruined when its overdraft is called in, or the father facing redundancy, wins.</p> <p>Hence Cooper, the mother of three who can talk approachably about how her neighbours manage tight budgets, is now being deployed as the human face of the credit crunch. For Labour strategists have identified an intriguing gender gap over the economy.</p> <p>Male voters need facts, figures and graphs in a crisis: women are quicker to fear for their jobs and homes, and to respond to human casualties. Men listen to Brown's lectures on the intricacies of short selling: women switch off unless he connects emotionally. And acknowledging female fears matters, because British women now make the majority of household spending decisions, from shopping at the supermarket to family holidays: when they stop buying, the retail economy hurts. We are likely to see much more of Cooper in the months to come.</p> <p>So has she ever known what it is like to be hard up and jobless? She hesitates before answering: 'I had one period of time when I was ill for a year and couldn't work for about 12 months. I just had to live on benefits for a period, and then could only work part-time for a while.' Virtually bedridden with ME, Cooper spent months watching soaps and worrying that life had passed her by, but insists she coped financially. 'It was manageable because I didn't have kids at the time. Often the big pressures are when people have to manage with a family.' Those pressures are now biting. And the first test looms of whether Labour's heartland voters will bite back.</p> <p>The area from the former mining villages of Cardenden and Markinch to the postwar new town that gives the Glenrothes parliamentary seat its name was once natural Labour territory. But nothing can now be taken for granted in the 6 November by-election. For weeks Labour has been resigned to losing: now, unexpectedly, comes a chink of hope. Lindsay Roy, Labour's candidate and the headteacher of Brown's old school in Kirkcaldy, believes the Prime Minister's stature has grown there because of, not despite, the economic crisis.</p> <p>'Somebody said to me that one reason they were changing from SNP to Labour is that they have money with HBOS and it's still in the bank,' says Roy, a 59-year-old grandfather who has worked the seat so hard he has lost a stone in weight. 'The implication was that if there had been an independent Scotland, perhaps the money would not have been there.'</p> <p>The omens are good enough for Brown to be planning a campaign visit: Roy says he is finding 'a lot of people who voted SNP for the first time in 2007, but now they are back with Labour'. Yet privately Labour staffers concede that last week's trump card - embarrassing SNP leader Alex Salmond for claiming Scotland could form an 'arc of prosperity' with virtually-bankrupted Iceland - has counted for little. Most voters in Glenrothes don't care about foreign policy, but about jobs.</p> <p>'One person said that it was all very fine that the bankers are getting bailed out, but it's time ordinary folk got some help,' says Peter Grant, the SNP candidate. 'They have all these billions of pounds to save the banks, but didn't step in with \u00a339m to save Farepak two years ago when a lot of people around here lost money and their children didn't have much of a Christmas. People haven't forgotten.'</p> <p>William Watson, a trained engineer who now runs Blueline Taxis in the town, agreed. 'I've seen nothing but manufacturing industries slamming the door in the face of the people; all the plants that gave people work have gone,' he explains. 'With the government bailing out the banks, I just don't know where the money is going to come from.'</p> <p>The Tories may in effect be out of the game in Glenrothes, which is a straight Labour-SNP fight, but nationally such concerns could present them with opportunities. At the height of the banking crisis, normal opposition politics had to be abandoned for decency's sake, and Cameron could not appear too sympathetic to the Tories' old friends in the City. Hence he and shadow Chancellor George Osborne decreed a period of 'consensus' with Labour, joining them in condemning extravagant City bonuses. But, to the alarm of many of his MPs, as a result they were blotted out of the media as Brown took credit for steadying the ship. The recovery in Brown's ratings caused barely disguised angst in the Tory high command.</p> <p>'If there is one thing the Cameron lot are terrified of, it is this sense that Brown is good in a crisis,' said one Tory MP. 'Yet by stepping back we let Brown be just that. We were nowhere.'</p> <p>As Tory frustration grew, Cameron and Osborne were savaged on the blogosphere for lacking policy and strategic touch. The ConservativeHome website carried a string of contributions complaining that the party leadership seemed dazzled in the headlights of a crisis for which it had no solutions. Andy Coulson, the head of communications, was said to be edgy about the lack of TV coverage for Cameron. The party says it has solid evidence that Cameron's ratings go up in direct proportion to the amount of airtime he has on prime-time TV - and he had not been on for days.</p> <p>The Tory tax-cutters came out to play too, arguing that the only way for a real Conservative party to react was to demand drastic spending and tax cuts to breathe some life back into the economy - rather than match Brown over tax and spend. Cameron's caution, they argued, was the last thing needed in the new economic world.</p> <p>Throughout the week, officials in Cameron's and Osborne's offices at the House of Commons worked late into the night to ensure that when their leader ended the truce with Brown on Thursday, with a speech in the City, the tone was right. Important ideological issues had to be finessed. How could the New Cameron Tories - who had never argued much for City regulation - now embrace it subtly without being accused of transparent opportunism? How could a party that had preached about the state staying out of the lives of individuals and the operations of businesses now tack the other way and welcome a good dose of state intervention to help save the economy? Cameron's economic policy was under the microscope as Brown received national and international applause.</p> <p>Friday's speech to the City was the moment when the gloves came off. The Tories would still back Brown over the banking rescue, but return to savaging his broader handling of the economy. The Prime Minister was branded a 'complete and utter failure' whose 10-year stewardship of the British economy allowed the country to build up staggering levels of personal debt. On Friday, Cameron visited South Yorkshire - where thousands of employees of Bradford &amp; Bingley and Halifax fear for their jobs - to hear voters' concerns. He now hopes to turn public anxiety into parliamentary gains in a part of England where his party desperately needs to break through.</p> <p>The 'Yorkshire triangle', which boomed on the back of financial services and now risks bust, is not the only northern region where the crisis is producing unexpected effects. Less than 50 miles away in Manchester, conventional wisdom is being turned on its head.</p> <p>Later this month, a referendum will be launched in the city asking drivers to pay a \u00a32 congestion charge to enter the traffic-choked city at rush hour. Far from being rejected by hard-up families, polling for the 'yes' campaign suggests opinion is now running at 52 per cent to 48 per cent in favour of this so-called stealth tax. Critically, \u00a33bn is promised for new public transport routes into Manchester as part of the deal - creating 10,000 jobs and allowing some families to ditch cars now becoming too expensive to run.</p> <p>'The economic scenario has transformed the debate,' says a source in the Yes Campaign. 'It's a major capital investment. This is, in effect, Manchester's insurance policy against a recession.'</p> <p>If it works, other cities will follow: Birmingham is watching closely. As is the Treasury. Could spending a few billion on better transport links in major cities be worth it to gain a once-in-a-lifetime chance to shift drivers on to greener public transport, creating jobs as a bonus?</p> <p>Such plans would be impossible if government cuts spending in response to shrinking tax receipts. But the Chancellor is now seriously considering a spending spree funded by borrowing. Just as Franklin D Roosevelt spent his way out of the Great Depression by building public works, Brown and Darling will back infrastructure projects that save jobs and stimulate the economy - initially, by bringing forward what had been long-term big plans. Shelter, the housing charity, is calling for government to buy land now while it is cheap and build social housing, keeping construction workers in jobs and providing homes for repossession victims.</p> <p>Can Brown flout the normal rules of politics and profit from a recession? A survey conducted this week by PoliticsHome.com suggests his popularity ratings are now back to April levels, before a disastrous summer of leadership speculation. He is seen as more intelligent and more decisive: the gap with Cameron is closing. 'Gordon's got his mojo back,' says one long-serving aide. So have his Cabinet: Peter Mandelson's return has, according to colleagues, brought a sharper analysis to the table that is worth any number of embarrassing tales about Russian millionaires in Corfu.</p> <p>Brown has also quietly reorganised Downing Street to focus on the economic crisis, seconding his head of policy, Dan Corry, to run a new Number 10 economics unit made up of special advisers poached from around Whitehall, including the Treasury's Sam White. Decks have been cleared of the battles hamstringing government, from 42 days' detention to children's Sats tests.</p> <p>And yesterday's controversial warning from minister Phil Woolas that immigration could become a 'thorny' issue as unemployment rises was a deliberate attempt to prevent the BNP making gains as the white working classes seek scapegoats for losing their jobs.</p> <p>The tectonic plates of British politics are shifting at a dizzying speed. In the Treasury there is unease at the pace at which the bank bail-out plan was put together, leaving many unanswered questions: it is still unclear how some of the attached conditions will work, never mind whether it will achieve its aims. The Treasury, accustomed to the ordered ritual of budgets, does not like making policy on the hoof. Unfortunately, that is a feeling that politicians entering this uncertain new dawn may have to live with for some time.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a>'s new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/immigrationpolicy\">immigration minister</a> was accused by members of his own party last night of 'pandering to right-wing extremists' after suggesting the number of migrants should be capped to ensure jobs for British workers during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">economic downturn</a>.</p> <p>Labour MPs and unions accused Phil Woolas of starting an 'auction of anti-foreigner rhetoric' with the Tories and far right. Woolas said in a newspaper interview that it had been 'too easy to get into this country in the past and it's going to get harder'. Signalling a new approach more in line with that of the Tories, he said ministers would not allow the population to rise above 70 million.</p> <p>'If people are made unemployed the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny,' Woolas said, suggesting he wanted jobs to be ring-fenced, where possible, for British workers.</p> <p>Up to now Labour has resisted pressure to impose an overall limit on migration from outside the EU, arguing that it can be managed through a points-based system under which entrants are assessed according to their skills and contribution to the economy.</p> <p>But with unemployment having risen to an eight-year high of 5.7 per cent, some in the Labour party now believe a stricter approach is needed, both for political reasons and to prevent community tension.</p> <p>Former Europe minister Denis MacShane said Woolas's remarks were potentially inflammatory. 'It's completely the wrong signal to send to the hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans, businessmen from Arab and Asian countries and even the 150,000 Russians creating and spending wealth in Britain, that we are thinking of shutting our doors,' he said. </p> <p>'At a time of economic downturn Britain should be a welcoming country for foreign investment.' He said the comments risked triggering an 'auction' in which political parties competed for the most anti-foreigner soundbites.</p> <p>Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said if Woolas was really calling for limits to be placed on those entering from Asian and African countries then he was 'wrong'.</p> <p>'There are already controls in place for these groups,' he said. 'If that is what he is saying there is danger this will be seen as pandering to right-wing extremists.'</p> <p>Britain's biggest union, Unite, suggested that such comments risked stoking tensions in the workplace.</p> <p>'Unite has called upon politicians from all parties to give leadership to avoid a rise in tension,' the union said. 'In turbulent times political parties should not divide workplaces or communities.'</p> <p>Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve accused Woolas of posturing without producing detail. 'We have been calling for immigration limits for years now but the government have repeatedly poured scorn on this,' he said.</p> <p> However Woolas was backed by other senior Labour figures. Frank Field MP, co-chairman of the Cross Party Group on Balanced Migration, described his contribution as a 'turning point in the whole debate on immigration'. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the population grew by nearly two million to 60,975,000 between 2001 and 2007.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said the government's points-based system provided 'a powerful and flexible set of controls' which allowed it to 'raise or lower the bar' according to needs.</p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research said fewer migrants were arriving in the UK and more were leaving. These trends were likely to be accelerated by the economic slowdown.</p>",
  "<h2>Best small tour operator<br>Audley Travel</h2> <p>I'm heading for bear country, a trip up the woody vastness of Canada's Yukon territory, following 400 miles of river before eventually chugging into Dawson City, famous for its Klondike gold rush of '98. So yes, I suppose you might call it gold country, but how can anyone think about gold with bears round every corner? Didn't I see a piece on the BBC website the other week about a poor couple who got eaten by bears? They're supposed to eat roots and berries, if you can believe that. Never trust a vegetarian who roars and weighs more than the 1968 Bulgarian women's weightlifting team, especially one that can run faster than you, swim faster than you and climb trees faster than you. </p> <p>Anyway I'm not going to dwell on it. Not till I get there anyway. I sit in Vancouver waiting for my delayed flight (grounded by a defective part) to Whitehorse, the Yukon capital, which with its 31,530 residents is the biggest speck on a map with not many specks. Staring at the polite notice reminding passengers not to bring antlers on to the plane, I remember that, in fact, there are more moose in the Yukon than people. So, moose country it is, then. I like the sound of that. Even at their grumpiest, I'm pretty sure moose don't eat tourists.</p> <p>Next day, in Whitehorse, I meet up with the rest of the group - three big guys from Manitoba, a couple of mums, some sensible teenagers. There's time to kill so we watch a short film about the gold rush and take an interesting tour round a 1929 paddle steamer that was kept busy going up to Alaska with its cargoes of Shredded Wheat and whiskey and, of course, people until someone thought of building a road in the 1950s. </p> <p>On a sunny day like today, it's hard to believe we're anywhere near the frozen north, but the river - wide, green and rolling - is solid ice in the winter. The thousands of gold-seekers who made it this far with their laughable homemade boats, having spent months dragging bundles of tents and frying pans and goats and kitchen sinks over precipitous mountains (the Canadian border authorities, rightly anxious about the lack of shops and restaurants near the Arctic Circle, specified a minimum ton of luggage per person), had to wait until the spring thaw before they could wave a happy goodbye to life's daily grind and pole off confidently into the world-class rapids here that no one told them about. </p> <p>Our guide for the week, Kyla, turns up, cheery, laidback and dreadlocked, and launches into the news of someone on the radio who was chased up a tree yesterday by a grizzly and had to be saved by his dog. It had the man's ankle in its jaws! Everyone thinks this is hilarious. I want to know when the guns get handed out. </p> <p>It's time to go. Kyla drives us down river a few miles until we see a hut and a wooden jetty. We were supposed to make the first part of the trip by boat, but now there's been a change of plan and we're going by float plane - a lovely old 1950s thing that comes buzzing in, closely followed by another. They glide across the water to pick us up, then we're off again, high above the river - sparkling and aquamarine now, with stretches of white glacial silt - watching our own shadow flit across the land and tree tops. Twenty minutes later we're splash-landing at Lake Labarge - our first stop. </p> <p>The shacks in the camp are brilliantly eccentric, built among the pines from raw planks and corrugated tin and canvas, the whole artfully crafted to resemble something knocked together in a hurry by someone without a spirit level. Inside, though, there's a luxury bed, a stove, fluffy bathrobes and five-star plumbing. </p> <p>After unpacking, we meet up for a walk to an abandoned Indian village. Showing us around is Jim, a First Nation man (Canada's version of native American) whose family lived on a settlement across the river from here, fishing and trapping and chasing caribou. We stand for a while amid the dilapidated cabins and bits of rusty ironware, swatting the mosquitoes while he tells us about his mother who worked on animal hides - tanning and softening them for moccasins and outer wear. To stretch the skin, Jim says, you had to wet it, scrape all the hair and the fat off and ferment it in moose brains. </p> <p>Over dinner at the main lodge (lots of great food, wine, and a nook with leather sofas, books and snowshoes above the fireplace) we talk about the migrations of indigenous peoples, mastodons, volcanoes, arrowheads - Jim's history and prehistory of the Yukon. Afterwards we take boats out on the lake, where Kyla shows me how to cast a fishing line without taking someone's eye out. Everybody catches a pike, quite possibly the same one. On the way back there's talk about bears. If it's a black bear you can usually scare him off, Kyla says, but grizzlies are different. It's best if you don't go off on your own, she adds, unnecessarily. </p> <p>Later, among my blurb I find a pamphlet about bear safety (Rule one: 'Never approach a bear'), with illustrations of pawprints and a photograph of an eight-foot grizzly sticking its nose into someone's tent. If a bear comes over and gives you a good beating, it may just be feeling defensive, it explains helpfully. Lie face down and protect your vital organs. I lock my door and scour the woods for movement. It's midnight and I lie awake watching the sky - only just dark now with streaks of pink still in it - through the crack in the curtains. I've never heard such quiet.</p> <p>There are pancakes for breakfast, thick but light as sponge and slathered with butter and hot blueberry sauce - eggs too, and herby sausages. Yum. It turns out the big guys went swimming last night after dark. The big guys are buddies - proper outdoorsmen with knowledge of hunting and tying knots. One, Brad, is a First Nationer and has a ponytail and an admirable Civil War moustache and goatee. I try to amuse them with my lack of everyday bush skills and fear of wild animals. Afterwards some of us go canoeing out to the beavers' dam up the creek while the big guys stick around the camp to fish. Kyla teaches me how to hold the paddle. When we stop for herbal tea (from her flask) she tells me about her passion for going out in horrifying Arctic conditions with a sled and a team of dogs. It may not entirely be a coincidence when in the afternoon we get in our speedy riverboat (it's a bit like a wide minibus) and visit some husky kennels upriver. The dogs are very welcoming. When one of them starts barking, the other hundred join in, just like a real family. I've never been anywhere as noisy in my life. The best of these yappers will be off on The Quest this winter - a 1,000-mile race from Fairbanks, Alaska, across the frozen wastes down to Whitehorse. In a big shed smelling of dog and hung with mushing boots, furs and harnesses, a woman tells us everything we need to know about trying to get the kettle going at 30 below zero without your fingers breaking off. It's enjoyment, but not as I know it. </p> <p>There are other excursions from Labarge to places of interest: an abandoned telegraph station, an abandoned Mountie post, an abandoned shipyard, where an entire steamboat has been hauled out of the water (and abandoned), its great wooden hull girded with iron bands, the curve of the wheelhouse shredded by time. There's something about all these ghostly outsized ruins - sagging cabins with their scattered detritus of rusty cans and holed buckets, a big red Chevrolet truck squatting in the bushes - that recalls the past more vividly than preserved historical sites. You get a sense of the sudden end of the importance to travellers of the river, which starts just above Whitehorse and flows north almost to the Arctic Circle, where it wisely turns left and heads for the Bering sea just across from Siberia, a total distance of 2,000 miles. You couldn't blame people for catching a bus when the Alaskan highway appeared half a century ago. </p> <p>We stroll about these encampments, Kyla identifying species of flora, moose dung, wild raspberries, edible fungi. We set up our table for a picnic of meatloaf, sandwiches, potato salad, apple cake, urns of tea and coffee. On the boat, and at the campfire after dinner, Kyla recites from the literature of the gold rush - a poem by Robert Service or a tale by Jack London, accounts of hardship, folly and dying of cold. </p> <p>On the third day we bid farewell to Labarge and board our planes for the long hop to Pelly River, further north. I sit up front, which means I get to steer if Derek, our pilot, has a heart attack. But it is soon clear that I'm the one likely to have a heart attack as Derek turns delightedly into Indiana Jones, plunging low between the riverbanks before banking and turning the horizon (and my breakfast) upside down. But soon we are droning over the endless hills and valleys - over Five Finger Rapids, over a lake whose chemical constituents have turned it a beautiful mouthwash turquoise, Derek telling us about aspects of the scenery in our headphones or exchanging wisecracks with the pilot in the other plane. </p> <p>Then, blimey, we see them, one, followed by another - bear cubs on a mountain top. There they go, scampering at the sound of our engines, the mother now emerging to look up at us with a cross expression. How thrilling! And of course bears can't fly. </p> <p>The Pelly River is a Yukon tributary and site of the territory's first homestead. The original building - a log cabin with a mossy roof - is still here, as is the current farm, built in the 1950s and still worked by the owner Hugh, who is well into his Seventies. </p> <p>We guzzle down a couple of beers and some home-baked snacks in the main lodge, a raw timber construction of barn-like dimensions with dining downstairs and a cosy bar where the hayloft should be, with rugs, old chests and agricultural paraphernalia. Our own cabins are like little houses on the prairie but with nicer baths. After an unusually meaty dinner (bison, reindeer, ham and cabbage), cooked by the excellent French chef, we pitch a few horseshoes before bed. </p> <p>At breakfast we hear of a grizzly that has been coming down from the hills in the past few days. It's not the news I've been waiting for. Luckily, we're out in the boat most of the time, with Kyla pointing out rock striations and eagles and tiny wild sheep on the high crags. </p> <p>One day we go to Fort Selkirk, an abandoned (though well looked-after) trading post and community, with restoration work going on and an interesting Indian cemetery with burial spots marked with little tents or sticks with feathers on. Afterwards we hike through the woods. Kyla has her bear spray, which according to my book is a useful deterrent, though on a windy day 'may disable the user'. Kyla advises us to make plenty of noise. </p> <p>I am hoarse with whooping by the time we all amazingly get out alive. There are still bears to be encountered though, albeit from the safety of our boat - two cubs and a grizzly idling along the waterside; a black bear emerging from the river. It's quite brilliant to see them.</p> <p>We were supposed to stay next at the 'Wilderness' camp but the builders are still in, so we head on to Dawson. It takes us the best part of a day to get there by boat, but the time is nicely punctuated by lunch, berry-picking in the bush (Brad considerately shows me fresh bear tracks) and a Robert Service poem from Kyla about premature death.</p> <p>Dawson is a great place to end up - it still looks like a pioneer boom town, full of drinking dens (Bombay Peggy's is my favourite, while the Pit is pretty much what it sounds like), spangly vaudeville shows and gambling, though it also has a bohemian feel to it. We all have a go at panning for gold, and listen to an elderly First Nation ex-trapper at the Cultural Centre tell tales of wolves and beavers (and of course bears) from the 1940s, when the Yukon was not very different from how it is now. </p> <p>On the day we leave Dawson, the big guys present me with a knitted, orange penis-warmer for the cold nights. I'm touched - I didn't get them anything.</p> <p>On the way home I have a relaxing day in Vancouver, a city where one may walk without fear. There's a spot of emergency souvenir buying in the old Gas Town area followed by a bike ride round the seawall of Stanley Park and a visit to the art gallery, which has an exhibition of work by the Chinese artist Zhang Huan, known for his uncomfortable-looking performances being covered in insects or dressed in raw meat. </p> <p>My guidebook recommends afternoon tea at the Wedgewood, which happens to be where I'm staying. Very civilised: doormen in top hats, Olympics on TV, an opportunity to wear normal shoes - it almost makes up for my not having seen a moose. And what were the chances of that?</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Phil Hogan travelled with Audley Travel (01993 838700; <a href=\"http://www.audleytravel.com\">www.audleytravel.com</a>) on an 11-day Great River Journey package.</p> <p>This includes eight days travelling along the Yukon River from Whitehorse to Dawson, as well as two nights in Vancouver and one in Whitehorse.

Leave the quinoa in a warm place for 24 hours until it is completely dry. Once dry, cook the quinoa in oil at 180\u00baC until it puffs up. Drain, soak up the excess oil on paper towel and season with salt while still hot.</p> <p>For the cooked quinoa, boil the quinoa in lightly salted water for 14 minutes. Drain and lay out on a tray to cool. Refrigerate.</p> <p>To make the Metil solution, blend the ingredients together at room temperature in a liquidiser until they form a smooth, even mixture. Strain and leave in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</p> <p>For the quinoa-coated langoustine, mix the cooked quinoa with the prepared Metil solution. Coat the langoustine tails with this mixture so that only the tail shell remains uncovered. Lay out on parchment paper and put in the refrigerator. </p> <p>For the spring-onion rings, peel and cut the spring onions into 2mm rings. Choose 28 rings with a 1.5cm diameter and soak them in water filled with ice cubes for 2 hours. Drain on a paper towel. Refrigerate. </p> <p>For the diced tomato blanch the tomato in boiling water, plunge it into iced water and then remove the skin. Cut the tomato into quarters and remove the seeds. Dice the tomato flesh into 0.5cm cubs. Refrigerate.</p> <p>To make the lime cubes and chopped zest, slice off the top and bottom of the limes to reveal the segments. Peel them in a spiral to expose the flesh and so that there are no traces of rind or pith, without altering the basic shape of the limes. Remove the segments from their membranes with a sharp knife. Cut the segments into 12 x 0.5cm cubes. Remove the zest and chop it into tiny 1mm cubes. Refrigerate each ingredient separately.</p> <p>To make the chilli oil, chop the chilli and leave to infuse in the oil for about 2 hours at 70\u00baC. Strain and put in a squeezy bottle.</p> <p>For the quinoa shoots, boil the quinoa shoots for 5 minutes in the measured water. Season with salt and keep hot. </p> <p><strong>Finishing and presentation</strong></p> <p>Lightly salt the quinoa-coated langoustine and fry both sides in olive oil. </p> <p>On the right-hand side of the plate, arrange a vertical salad made up of 7 spring onion rings, 7 tomato cubes, 3 lime cubes 4 small coriander leaves, and a little chopped lime zest. Finish with 4 drops of chilli oil, salt and a few drops of extra-virgin olive oil. </p> <p>Mix 60g of cooked quinoa shoots with 30g of puffed quinoa and heat under the salamander grill . </p> <p>Divide the mixture among the four dishes. Place as a bouquet in the base of the dishes.</p> <p>Cut the upper part of the tail off the quinoa-coated langoustine so that the top part of the tail is bare. Place a langoustine tail vertically on the left-hand side of the salad, leaving a space of 4cm in which to arrange vertically a spoon of langoustine essence and oil. </p> <p>The kefir comes in a separate jug so that the waiter can serve it in front of the diner.</p> <p><strong>Cutlery</strong> Spoon, fork and fish knife.</p> <p><strong>How to eat</strong> Each ingredient alternately.</p> <p><strong>Read Jay Rayner on meeting Adri\u00e0 and let us know what you think <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/oct/16/restaurants-restaurants\">on the blog <br></a></strong></p>",
  "<p>Once, at a restaurant called Babylon, I was served a chicken sausage that, even the waiters agreed, looked like a severed penis on a plate. I have eaten undercooked okra, the natural juices of which had the consistency of snot but none of the flavour, have cut into a microwaved Jamaican dumpling which was so hard it sprang off my plate and skittered away under the next table and been presented with plates of gristly student food by a bunch of avowed anti-Semites. The latter being all you deserve if you volunteer to go for dinner at the Nation of Islam Cafe. </p> <p>I have done all of these things partly so you wouldn't have to and partly because I am an eternal optimist. Then again, how can you be anything other than optimistic in life when you have had the sublime pleasure of being told by your employers that, for the foreseeable future, you will to be paid to go out for dinner and write smart-arse things about it? When good things like that happen to you, optimism becomes its own reward.</p> <p>It is now almost 10 years since I started going out for dinner and writing smart-arse things about it. That's a lot of smart-arse things and a lot of dinners. Well in excess of 700, if you include the meals eaten for other reasons (and there have always been other reasons). I have measured out my life in coffee spoons. And amuse-bouches that weren't all that amusing. I have endured mediocre cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es - plus a few good ones. And there has been pork belly. Lots and lots of pork belly. So much pork belly, that I now have to remind myself not to order it. Sometimes I forget to remind myself. I like pork belly. So shoot me! </p> <p>That single cut of meat is one of the abiding motifs of the past decade. When I kicked off at the end of the Nineties, it was almost never seen on restaurant menus. It was bracketed with offal. It was the stuff that got thrown away or given to the dog, but only if it had misbehaved. The business of going out to restaurants was still so tightly bound up with notions of status and largesse, that serving something that dangled so close to the earth was unthinkable. </p> <p>Let's be clear. Too much of eating out in Britain is still bound up with status and largesse. Old habits die very hard. But there is at least the whiff of democratisation in the air. It still costs too much. There's still a lot of Class A stupidity out there (who genuinely needs their wine glass filled for them?) but because there are so many more restaurants today there is also a lot more good stuff. Hurrah for that. </p> <p>The fact is that the late Nineties, when I first pulled up to the table, really was a different place. Marco Pierre White was still ruling his kitchens and, with a PR flourish, was only just about to 'give back' his three Michelin stars. (There was never anything to return. All he could ask was that Michelin stop grading him.) His prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a mouthy bloke called Gordon, was yet to win his third star, and out in Bray a former bailiff with an obsessive streak as wide as the Thames Estuary, was pottering around making smokey bacon ice cream and mixing white chocolate with caviar. Right up until the day in 2004 when he won his third Michelin star, Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck would be on the verge of going bust. </p> <p>At the very top end of the British gastronomic scene, it is the career paths and influence of Ramsay and Blumenthal that have dominated the past 10 years. For the first half of this decade Ramsay ruled supreme, with a brand of precise, shiny neoclassicism which seemed critic-proof (and believe me, I tried). Not only did he win his third Michelin star but he began to colonise the hotel restaurants of London like some multi-drug- resistant strain of TB.</p> <p>Ten years later, only someone determined to make the man a poster boy for tall poppy syndrome, could claim he was on the way out. Even with the recent departure of Marcus Wareing from his stable to go it alone, Ramsay still dominates London and his restaurants around the world have practically become embassies for Britain's newly self-confident gastronomy. And yet, for all that, he cannot claim to be at even the bluntest of cutting edges. His neoclassicism now looks like plain old classicism. Instead, the pace has been set by Heston Blumenthal, with his palate cleansers bathed in liquid nitrogen and his mustard ice cream with red cabbage gazpacho and his Sound of the Sea, a dish mimicking a beach laid with foam and seafood, to be eaten while listening to the crash of waves and the call of gulls on an iPod. </p> <p>Tricksy, yes, but intriguing and playful. Blumenthal's impact on luxury British restaurants is enormous. Here's a roll call of just a few of the places - generally outside London - that should acknowledge some debt to him: Midsummer House in Cambridge, l'enclume in the Lake </p> <p>District, Restaurant Sat Bains in Nottingham, Purnell's in Birmingham, Anthony's in Leeds, Restaurant Tom Aikens in London, Hibiscus first in Ludlow and now also in the capital. Even if the chefs deny Blumenthal's direct influence, without his bullet-headed stubbornness there would have been little appetite among restaurant goers for the sort of whiz-bang cookery these people now practise. His greatest contribution to British gastronomy: the triple-cooking method of preparing chips, which is now on menus across the country. Re-engineering the way people make something as simple as the chip is surely proof of culinary genius. </p> <p>Not that Heston's influence has been entirely for the good. There has been a whole bunch of young cooks who thought they knew what they were doing and quite simply didn't. I will never forget my visit to Langtry's in London where I was served a deconstructed prawn cocktail, described as their signature dish. God knows why anybody would want to put their name to this: a high ball glass filled with underpowered shellfish jelly, avocado cream and a cloyingly sweet Marie rose sauce ice cream. There are good reasons for not making ice cream out of mayonnaise and tomato ketchup, not least good manners. The tiny battered prawns, like so much gravel on the top, didn't help any. Oh dear. As I said at the time, Heston Blumenthal, this is all your fault.</p> <p>Mind you, British chefs and restaurateurs have proved more than capable of doing really stupid things all by themselves. The fashion-driven restaurant, which is sodden with bowel-twisting concepts, was there right at the beginning and is still there now. I recall, in 2000, a foul lunch at Asia de Cuba, where the culinary traditions of the East and Havana were forced into an abusive marriage at gunpoint, in one of the hotels owned by style victim Ian Schrager. As I said at the time: 'Presumably the intention is to attract a crowd so cool that they would rather die, darling, than kick up a fuss about being overcharged for shoddy service, a stupid concept and ludicrous food.' </p> <p>Only last year the same hotel group gave us Suka which, as I explained then, 'does to the noble culinary traditions of Malaysia what the Romans did to the Sabine women'. In between there was the mercifully short-lived Shumi, a rather less-than-needed fusion of Japanese and Italian food, the 'luxury' Ukrainian restaurant Divo, which made me understand why my forebears had left in such a hurry (to escape the cooking), and a plethora of places that thought Pan-Asian tapas was a good idea, because Thailand, Japan, Singapore, China and all points in between are obviously just the same place and anybody can cook that stuff. The nadir of these was Cocoon, where the music thudded, the waiters wore headphones and the ruched material on the ceilings looked like cat's arses. As my companion that night so wisely said, when naming Cocoon they should have stopped at the first syllable. </p> <p>But where ethnic restaurants have been created by people who knew the turf, good things have happened. Ten years ago all ethnic restaurants were essentially generic: Indian, Chinese, Japanese and so on. Now regionality has crept in. The likes of the Red Chilli group, from Manchester to Leeds and York, with their fiery Sichuanese broths that numb the lips and pound the tongue, have been followed by places like Bar Shu and Snazz Sichuan in London. There are Shanghaiese restaurants and Taiwanese restaurants, and a range of Indian places that want you to know that the dishes they are serving come from the Gujarat or the Punjab, Rajasthan or Goa. Good sushi is easier to come by. </p> <p>Because for all the bad news there has been lots of good. These, for example, have been the years of the tasting menu. Forget three courses. Laugh in the face of four. How about six, or nine, or more? For me it began in 2002 at Thyme, a modest neighbourhood restaurant in South London where chefs Adam Byatt and Adam Oates served me half-a-dozen beautifully measured courses, which made their point through a single thing - a cauliflower soup, a foie gras parfait - done brilliantly well. A couple of years later the gifted chef Andrew Tyler served me up nine dinky little courses at Restaurant 1880 only to be outdone, a few months after that by a Californian restaurant called Manresa, which managed 26. A lot of them - the sweet scallop tartar, the sea urchin sabayon - were truly fabulous, but it was a masterclass in overkill. At the end the chef came out and asked me if he had won, as if it had been a Grecian wrestling match. I agreed that he had.</p> <p>Elsewhere there was a move towards the eco restaurant, not all of which impressed. I was brutal early on about Barny Haughton's Bristol place Rocinantes, which made much of the sourcing of its ingredients but then buggered them up, and rude a few years later about his new venture, Bordeaux Quay, for the same reasons. But others, most notably Acorn House and the Water House in London, made the notion of the sustainable, environmentally aware restaurant work for one reason and one reason only: the most important thing was the food - lovely plates of braised meat, great seasonal vegetables - not the principles that got them to the table. Plus they made drinking tap water in restaurants not only an acceptable thing to do, but the only way to go.</p> <p>These, of course, were bespoke establishments, which recognised that there were small numbers of people out there with money in their pockets willing to spend it on the good stuff. More important than this was the way these improvements spread to the high street, realised in a series of increasingly reliable and customer-aware chains serving good food at good prices. I have long been an unembarrassed fan of Pizza Express, for offering a reliable product and great service at a reasonable price; I take my kids there on a regular basis. (Its recent tie-up with the terrific chef Theo Randall, who has come up with four new pizzas, is inspired.)</p> <p>It has been joined by the likes of Strada and the Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Wagamama, Giraffe, Carluccio's and, most recently, Jamie's Italian which seems set to become a major force in every market town in the country. Jamie Oliver's 15 project, designed to put the unemployable into employment, may have given him a warm fuzzy feeling; his high-street venture will give him an even bigger bank balance.</p> <p>But the real story of the decade belongs to that pork belly and, more importantly, the kind of place that would serve it, namely the gastro-pub. Apparently it's a horrible word. People spit it out. Egon Ronay once said that the gastro-pub has become to Britain what the bistro once was to France and I think he's right. </p> <p>Not all the news has been good. Some of the generic catering companies have got in on the act, offering prepackaged pre-chargrilled chicken breasts or weird sickly green curries or lamb shanks in a redcurrant gravy that makes your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth. Rule of thumb: if, at the bottom of a pub chalkboard menu, you see the words 'some dishes may contain nuts' - run away. It means the food wasn't prepared there and they don't know what's in it. </p> <p>But the good gastro-pubs have become a vital and unique part of our eating landscape. I have reviewed dozens of them: the Cow in Westbourne Grove, the Eagle and Child in Stow-on -the-Wold, the Blacksmith's Inn at Westow, The Fox in Shoreditch, the Charles Napier at Chinnor, the Sportsman at Whitstable, the Sun Inn at Dedham and on and on. These places generally obsess about ingredients and their provenance, do as little as possible to ruin them and then serve them with the minimum of fuss. Children are welcomed, rather than treated like scrofulous aliens. </p> <p>On top of this has emerged another trend, shepherded into the world by the gutsy, offal-led approach of Fergus Henderson's St John, which opened in 1994. That brusque no-nonsense meaty agenda has been picked up by the Anchor &amp; Hope in London, the Westerly in Reigate and many others besides and created, for the first time, a British style of cooking informed by a French sensibility but not mortgaged to it. So we get braised beef cheeks, or pig's head galettes or roast cod with cockles and outbreaks of samphire and watercress salad.</p> <p>And of course we get lots of pork belly. Would you be surprised to hear that this makes me very happy indeed? I thought not. In short, any decade that puts more pork belly on the menu has to have been a good one. And I have been very lucky to have eaten my way through it.</p>",
  "<p>If there are still critics of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray\">Andy Murray</a> south of the border, their numbers, surely, must be dwindling. The finest player Britain has produced since Fred Perry burnished his soaring reputation here in the semi-final of the ATP Masters Madrid by beating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/federer\">Roger Federer</a> 3-6 6-3 7-5.</p> <p>Murray will now play the rising French star Gilles Simon, who battled Rafael Nadal in an extraordinary 3hr 22min marathon and came through to win 3-6 7-5 7-6, winning the tiebreak 8-6. Simon, who had saved six match points in earlier matches, says he never gets tired. Murray will test that today.</p> <p>It was Murray's third victory over the former world No1 in five meetings and offered some measure of revenge for the defeat he suffered against Federer in last month's US Open final. Despite being unable to prevent Britain losing to Austria in the Davis Cup, there is very little Murray has done wrong in the past three months and, if anything, his world ranking of No 4 looks beneath him. With Novak Djokovic going off the boil, the 21-year-old Scot has certainly looked like the third best player in the world since August, especially as he beat Djokovic in successive weeks at Toronto and Cincinnati.</p> <p>His reputation in the place where it counts most, the tour locker room, is that of a player who has it all. Any coach and most rivals will talk to you about his unerring accuracy off the ground, his fine serve and his deceptive speed. And Federer, in particular, talks of his tactical acumen - the ability to think on his feet and change his approach if things are not going his way.</p> <p>That is precisely what he needed to do here yesterday after a tentative first set that had seen him still unable to shake off the nerves he had felt when facing his legendary opponent in his first Grand Slam final in New York. The previous day he had spoken of being more relaxed here - which was only natural, given the fact that he had not had to face Nadal in a protracted battle over two days, as he did at the US Open - as well as the brilliance of his own form while dismissing as good a player as Ga\u00ebl Monfils 6-2 6-2 here in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>But there was no doubt Federer deserved the first set, partially as a result of the kind of errors that cost Murray the break in the sixth game - a forehand that sailed long. But there were no histrionics, an improvement in his game that Federer noted afterwards.</p> <p>'You need to give young guys time to learn,' said Federer, who had temperament problems of his own in his teens. 'It's fun to see them learning.' But the Swiss found it less fun to see how Murray was able to turn the match around; slowly pressing the accelerator until his game took on a more aggressive mode.</p> <p>At deuce in the fourth game of the second set, Murray unleashed a superb forehand service return that Federer hardly saw and was in at the net on the break point to finish the game. Murray never allowed Federer a sniff of a break back as he levelled the match and, despite having to stave off a break point at 0-1 in the third, he seemed to have taken control when he got Federer 0-40 down in the third game. But Federer was playing at close to his best and reeled off five consecutive points to hold.</p> <p>Murray, looking composed by this stage, had another break point at 2-2, but Federer's responses were helping to elevate the contest to the kind of duel the capacity 9,600 crowd wanted.</p> <p>Murray continued to serve with great authority - he had not lost a point on his first serve in the second set - and with his returns starting to bite, Federer found himself facing another break point in the 11th game. After a great rally, the sting in the Scottish backhand was enough to force the error. Two aces helped Murray served out for this memorable victory</p> <p>'I am playing great tennis; yesterday I played great but with all respect to Ga\u00ebl Monfils [whom he beat in the quarter-final], he is not Federer,' said Murray. 'First, with Federer and Nadal, the respect you have for them is greater and when they are behind they are always going to come back at you. So it's tough to dictate a match. But I served huge; my second serve was very good. I stayed calm and found the big shot at the right time.'</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338627283\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1858822315_Bulli-Playout-QT-PAL-16-9final-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>In the end securing a table at the best restaurant in the world was pretty straightforward. All I had to do was decide at the age of 15 to become a journalist, then pursue that career with single-minded determination for the next 17 years, until some one had the ludicrous notion of appointing me restaurant critic, cling to the job with limpet-like commitment for the best part of a decade so that I was still in post when, praise be, chef of said restaurant was about to publish a book and was keen to talk to a newspaper about it. Though even then the table wasn't guaranteed. They weren't going to allow me to sit down to eat until I argued that the piece would make no sense unless I had experienced the intense theatricals and dramatics, the mouth fireworks and tongue gymnastics, the long-lauded wizardry and madness and flavour games for which elBulli was famous, all for myself. </p> <p>Even allowing for that last-minute bout of international negotiations \u2013 Ban Ki-moon would have been proud \u2013 my method of getting to eat at Ferran Adri\u00e0's restaurant in northern Spain really does make more sense than the alternative. There are just 52 seats at elBulli and it is open for only six months of the year, from spring until autumn. In short there are just 8,000 seats available in any 12-month period. These days, for those 8,000 seats, they receive two million requests, a dam burst of desperate, pleading, hungry, saliva-flecked emails fired off at the start of the season, upon which Adri\u00e0's staff must stand in judgment.</p> <p>The interest in elBulli and Adri\u00e0 may seem at times cultish, verging on the messianic, but in the feverish world of high-end gastronomy, where the pursuit of the next transcendent mouth experience is an end in itself, it does make a warped kind of sense. Since the late 1980s, when Adri\u00e0 and his team first started pushing the boundaries of food and cooking at their isolated restaurant in the mountains a two-hour drive north of Barcelona, they have never stood still. First they became famous for replacing sauces with foams and for presenting flavours through the medium of warm jellies. As those ideas spread about the world, becoming clich\u00e9s, they moved on, 'cooking' ingredients in liquid nitrogen or deconstructing famous dishes so that all you could do as you ate them was laugh. Others would be left behind scrabbling to catch up, while Adri\u00e0 forged ahead. As he would eventually say to me, 'The Bulli is always changing. The Bulli of today is not the Bulli of yesterday.' Just its name, the Spanish for bulldog, has become synonymous with revolution, innovation and \u2013 if you really do have an overly developed interest in your dinner \u2013 the promise of gustatory rapture and bliss.</p> <p>It's a hell of a lot to live up to. Indeed, the level of interest causes the restaurant problems. For the past three years it has been voted the best in the world, in The World's 50 Best Restaurants list, run by Restaurant magazine. Panels of judges covering different regions of the world are asked to name their top five, which must be made up of establishments in their region and outside it. The only other rule is that they must have eaten in the nominated restaurants within the past 18 months. So how, furious critics asked when elBulli was yet again named the best in the world earlier this year, can it keep coming out on top when it is almost impossible to get a table? </p> <p>Even as the chair of the British panel I cannot explain it; nominations are kept secret. But I can say this. Having eaten there, when it comes to drawing up my own nominations next year, elBulli will be right at the top. My meal there was quite simply the best of my life \u2013 the most intriguing, the most entertaining, the most delicious \u2013 which is a staggering achievement for a place hyped beyond all bounds of sense or logic. I went nursing a fear that I would be disappointed. I left all those fears by a ragged Catalan beach. </p> <p>All of which makes me hugely grateful for the publication of A Day at elBulli, the book which made my visit possible. There have been elBulli books before, of course, but those are less volumes to be read than catalogues to which one might refer. Assuming what you needed to know was exactly what elBulli was doing with porcini flavoured 'caviar' in 2003. Those huge, \u00a3100-plus-a-pop titles, like the exhaustive website, are a complete record of every single dish ever created at elBulli: their ingredients, their plating, their context. And there are many, many hundreds of them. They mark the place out less as restaurant and more as a living museum. Which makes Ferran Adri\u00e0 less chef than curator. Or, perhaps, artist in residence (last year he was invited to create a central work for the Documenta contemporary art exhibition in Germany, a kind of art Olympics held every five years.) </p> <p>A Day at elBulli: An Insight into the Ideas, Methods and Creativity of Ferran Adria is a very different kind of book. This one genuinely might sit on a coffee table, and you don't have to be a culinary propellerhead to enjoy it. It does what it says on the cover, but in a very elBulli kind of way. Over 20,000 photographs were taken, and more than 1,200 have found their way inside. From sunrise over the hidden cove it sits upon and the surf lapping at the shore, through Adri\u00e0's morning routine to the head-bowed, monk-like devotion of the 50 or so cooks and their mis-en-place, the invention of dishes, the drawing-up of menus, the opening of the gates, the dinner service and the clean-down to the final turning of the key in the lock, everything is here. It is detailed and intense. It is knowingly arty. It puts the phwoar into gastro-porn. </p> <p>The irony is, of course, that the chef is such a celebrated figure, in his native Spain such a national hero, that the routine the title suggests is now a rare luxury. Initially we asked that we be allowed to spend a day with Adri\u00e0. I imagined sipping thimbles of hot black coffee with him as the sun rose and then following him through the studious process of providing diners with a once-in-a-lifetime experience. But that wasn't going to happen. Too busy. Too many people to talk to. Too many things to consult upon. Instead we would be allowed just a few hours, and so I drew up a plan: how long we would conduct a formal interview, some time in the kitchen, a conversation about the creation of dishes. What I hadn't bargained with was the chaotic, ebullient, performer that is Adri\u00e0 himself. I made plans and the moment we met every single one was thrown out the window. </p> <p>I should have seen it coming. For the past three years, at the end of The World's 50 Best Restaurants event in London, Adri\u00e0 has been invited to <br>make a speech, and it has always been a drawn-out affair. His sentences are long and complex, and loop around on each other in a way that leaves poor translators rushing to catch up. His arms rise and fall with every clause and noun, and he is never done until he has invited every other Spanish chef in the room up on to the stage to link arms and sing 'We are the World'. Or something like that. By that point the translator is usually sobbing in the corner. It is not the highlight of the night, but it is very Adri\u00e0. </p> <p>And that's exactly what I get when we meet, on the terrace at elBulli: something rambling and passionate and hard to keep up with. The food served here may be decidedly modernist, looking to the future rather than the past, but the space in which it is served is homely, a hacienda-style lodge of rough-hewn stone and gnarled black beams and whitewashed stone shelves stacked with what look like old family portraits in tarnished frames. Adri\u00e0 suits the space. There is nothing sleek or, heaven forfend, hip about him. He is a short, stocky man of middle years, with a mop of curly hair which he probably has to be reminded to get cut now and again. He listens intently to me as the translator explains my plan \u2013 the set-piece interview, the tour of the kitchens, the exposition \u2013 nods at every point, says that's a great idea but then announces, a finger raised. 'But first I must explain to you the Bulli.' </p> <p>And we are off. We never sit down at all. Instead the interview is conducted entirely on the run. First he insists on describing the history, how it was opened in 1961 as a beach cafe and only slowly developed into a restaurant, the Michelin stars that it won and lost, until he arrived after military service in 1983, becoming its head chef a year later. In those days, he says, elBulli was in thrall to the ways of nouvelle cuisine, the movement which, in its purest form, eschewed the butter and cream of the Escoffier generation in favour of lighter, brighter, sharper flavours. With its love of fiddly curls of avocado and kiwi and its tiny portions it was eventually much mocked and pilloried, I say. He shrugs. 'Those who come up with something new are always criticised.' He describes himself as a student of nouvelle cuisine, says it is what 90 per cent of gastronomic restaurants are practising today. </p> <p>He picks up a copy of elBulli: 1983 to 1993. It is stuffed with pictures of the food they were serving then, bright colour plates full of scarlets and oranges; dishes of red mullet with tiny cubes of aubergine or fiddly dice of tomato with teeny slivers of meat served rare. There are dishes in there which are exact copies of others by the big gastronomic names of the day like Georges Blanc or Mark Haeberlin, whose food Adri\u00e0 had studied. Slowly, he says, they decided to attempt a site-specific kind of nouvelle cuisine, something which suited Spain in particular. He shows me a picture of a dish which he says is based on gazpacho, the various elements served dry around the plate rather than as a soup. </p> <p>Trying to sound clever I ask if that is one of his first deconstructions, the essentials of a dish taken apart and reconfigured so that you might consider it anew. He looks intensely at me, as if I am a promising but lazy student who has let myself down. 'No, no. This is an adaptation. With an adaptation you will always see the differences.' With a deconstruction it is less immediately obvious. Right. </p> <p>He picks up another volume and shows me a flow chart. It is a timeline of elBulli's food and its developments. Here, in the late 1980s, is where they started working on adaptations. Here, in the early 1990s, the deconstructions come in. Next, the foams and the jellies and so on. This, he says, is what I must understand. 'The mid-90s is when we started to create a new language.' </p> <p>Most leading chefs I have interviewed talk at some point about the land and nature's bounty. They reference some eye-moistening experience at their mother's apron strings. Not Adri\u00e0. The words he uses most are 'discourse' and 'language', 'creativity' and 'innovation'. </p> <p>'The Bulli is about creativity,' he says, a finger raised. 'If you don't understand this you don't understand the Bulli.' And ' creativity is a very fucked-up issue. It's not a game. It's not about playing around. It's a serious business.' For six months of the year, while the restaurant is closed, Adri\u00e0 retreats with his brother Albert, the pastry chef, and his key lieutenants, to a workshop in Barcelona \u2013 the Taller \u2013 to develop the menu for the next season. But these are never ingredient-led affairs. It is never about anything so banal as what they can do that's new with duck or seaweed or chocolate. It's all about method. 'To develop a new language you need a new concept, a technique, an elaboration.' </p> <p>'Who came up with beating three eggs and making an omelette,' he says, ' that's a new elaboration, a new technique.' The same is true, he <br>says, with the mixing of flour with water to make pastry, to make dough, which in turn lead to the creation of thousands of new dishes. 'Our dream is to be able to make new kinds of pastry or omelettes which in turn lead to new dishes.' To do this, over the years they have begged, borrowed and stolen. They have adopted Japanese techniques for making warm jellies from seaweed extracts (rather than from animal-based gelatins which melt just above room temperature). They have plundered industrial food processes, of the sort used to make the little jellies of pimento in the middle of stuffed olives, or mass-market emulsifiers of the kind used in salad dressing to make foams stay stiff. Sometimes they have built whole riffs around the art of happy accidents. They freeze-dry things. They vacuum-pack. They use pipettes and distillers. 'The more unique a language you create the fewer people understand it,' he says. 'For many people coming to the Bulli for the first time, it's like being spoken to in Japanese.' But here is what's changed, he says. Some years ago people eating there were simply baffled or dismayed by what they were being served. 'Now the people who come here are willing to be open to the experience.' </p> <p>And yet, he says, the restaurant is misunderstood. People assume it's all about the science, that it's whizz bang and pointy headed. I suggest he complains too much. After all isn't that his fault for constantly banging on about the need to innovate? He agrees that he is partly to blame, and mentions a photograph of him and Heston Blumenthal of the Bulli-esque Fat Duck \u2013 the two are firm friends \u2013 surrounded by clouds of vapour from liquid nitrogen. 'The science issue is a monster we must kill.' </p> <p>What he says we all must understand is that his kitchen is still a kitchen. 'There are 70 people working at elBulli. It is very artisanal.' And he leads me into it. There is no door; the front of house and kitchen flow into each other organically, but where the dining room is classical Spanish, the kitchen is full of clean, sharp lines and flat surfaces. It is a kitchen as imagined by James Bond designer Ken Adam. At the back is an acre of plate-glass window looking out on to the ragged rust-coloured rock of the cliff face. In front of that are three long workbenches. The middle one is surrounded by at least a dozen young cooks, heads bowed over tiny, intricate preparation works. They stand there for hours, are there mid-afternoon and still there all the way through the dinner service. Fewer than a dozen of the kitchen staff are paid to work at elBulli. The rest \u2013 like our own Jason Atherton of Maze one year \u2013 come here simply for the experience and to work for free. </p> <p>The bench on the right, he tells me, is where new dishes are being developed. Although a lot of menu development takes place off-season they open each season with the previous year's dishes, slowly but surely replacing them with new ones, those in turn being replaced. In all there are three menus a year. 'A few dishes stay on all year. Others are seasonal or involve rare ingredients so only stay on for a short while.' Next to us is a tiny pan containing a lightly steaming cloudy jelly with what looks like two chickpeas in it. 'When they cook chickpeas in the market the stock at the end turns into a jelly.' I am invited to try one of the chickpeas. It tastes as I expect at first, and then a nuttiness comes in. 'They are fresh hazelnuts,' the young cook next to me says, with a grin. 'This is not a finished dish,' Adri\u00e0 says. 'It is an idea.' </p> <p>As we talk another cook hands him a thin, crisp disc of dried fig, with a smear of something flavoured with vanilla and salt. 'We are looking to create a snack,' he tells me. He nibbles, looks off into a distant corner and then issues a command. Try something else with it. Now he's given a little crisp made of dried, toasted rice. 'This is what you get at the bottom of a paella pan when it starts to stick. We are thinking of making something with it.' There is a flat red disc, of concentrated dehydrated tomato, like a communion wafer, and then a tiny aubergine that has somehow been manufactured to look like an olive. Everything here in the low-lit kitchen is tiny, thimble sized, but in the mouth they clatter around with flavour. </p> <p>'Cooking is about how things taste,' he says. 'Obviously we use technology but that's not what matters. What matters is that you, the eater, finds it magical. It's an experience between the creator and the eater.' I ask him why he has decided to publish this book. 'I did this because I wanted to let people who couldn't get here visualise what it's about.' He admits that he could sell seats in his restaurant on eBay for thousands of Euros a time, that he could have 25 elBullis around the world and make a mint. But he doesn't. Instead there is just this one and, despite charging \u20ac200 for the menu per head, excluding drinks, it operates at a loss. It is all the other businesses \u2013 the consultancies with hotels, the more casual restaurants, his work with mass-market food producers and, yes, the books \u2013 which make the money. So is he now more of a communicator than a cook? He shakes his head. 'No, above all I'm a cook.' But more people consume his food by reading about it than eating it. 'It's the only thing I can't fix. It's a real shame. We're not proud of it.' </p> <p>It is heading towards six o'clock and I can feel the mood changing in the kitchen. From a sense of quiet industry, the pace has picked up. In the dining room, tablecloths are being ironed, cutlery laid. Adri\u00e0 says it is time for him to crack on and for me to go. He has issued orders. I am not simply allowed to stay here until dinner. El Bulli sits on a cove a 20-minute drive along a mountain road of hairpin bends from the tourist resort of Roses. Adri\u00e0 has ordered me to go back down there to my hotel, to freshen up, change and then come back. He has also asked that I do not drive myself back. 'You need time to relax, to swap from interviewer to diner.' I like taking orders from Adri\u00e0. I do as I am told. </p> <p>When it was over, when the last of the 42 (tiny) items we were served had been cleared away and we had drunk our espresso and finished raiding the cigar humidor containing only handmade chocolates and been given our individual menus, what stayed with me was the attention to detail. While for the diners it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, the staff have to do it every single night. And yet there is nothing jaded or casual about it. They not only accept, but embrace the notion of the singular event. Waiters happily take photographs of diners posing next to the elBulli sign outside. Every guest is led into the kitchen to meet Adri\u00e0 and to have their photograph taken with him, and he falls into position next to them with ease. Enquiries have been made beforehand over allergies or dislikes so every table can be told, truthfully, that the menu that evening has been tailored to them (though, in truth, there is no choice. Only one tasting menu is served and most people get exactly the same dishes.) </p> <p>It begins with a hollow sphere of ice, containing meltwater, to be sucked through a hollowed-out vanilla pod. The effect lies not just in the refreshing water with a hint of vanilla, but in the visual: the miraculous ball of ice which forces you to think of mountain air. Next, a cocktail of lemon and grappa and yoghurt, but served as a cream with a sugared surface as a very adult cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. And alongside this, tiny, dolls'-house tangerine segments, manufactured God knows how, which burst under the slightest tongue pressure. We are brought what looks like an ostrich egg, gently steaming with icy vapour. It is broken at the table. It feels in the mouth like an unsweetened white chocolate but tastes of very mellow coconut, which we are to dust with Indian spices. </p> <p>After an orchid flower, whose leaves have been made from a brittle paste of passion fruit, we are presented with a children's tea party of snacks: intense discs of parmesan, dark bitter-chocolate pyramids flavoured with pine nut, powerful crisps of tomato. And then, best of all, plump olives laid on a spoon before us. </p> <p>They are the colour and shape of olives but glisten and shudder. We put them in our mouths. It is the first example this evening of elBulli's current favourite technique \u2013 spherification \u2013 a liquid, pur\u00e9e or gel set within a tight membrane so that in the mouth it bursts releasing a rush of flavour, in this case the pure essence of olive. It works by dropping a ball of the pur\u00e9e into a setting agent, hence the sphere. They also do this with bright, milky mozzarella. But at elBulli they have worked out how to create shapes with it: tiny triangles of 'pesto' ravioli, say, or a long thin tube flavoured with miso and ponzu to accompany a razor clam. The latter also speaks of another recurring them, which is Japanese flavours and spicings. It is a curiously Asian meal. </p> <p>It is also full of whimsy. There is candyfloss encasing beautiful fronds of perfumed wild flowers. There is a set of odd-looking mouthfuls on a plate that, eaten together, taste exactly like spaghetti carbonara. We are presented with a single 'oyster leaf' holding a bead of shallot vinegar, and blow me, if the leaf doesn't taste exactly like an oyster. My companion is Stephen Harris, the chef from the Michelin-starred Sportsman pub near Whitstable. He announces he is going to find a supply of oyster leaves the moment he gets home. We have braised tomatoes injected with olive oil. Stephen spears one with a fork and it sprays juice across the table. 'Well,' he says, gleefully, ' if you're going to serve me fabulously weird shit like this, that sort of thing is bound to happen.' </p> <p>There is a single strawberry braised in gin and gnocchi made from jellified egg yolk, and a deconstructed walnut, endive and Roquefort salad. Most strikingly there is very little meat. There is a single cylinder of intensely savoury veal tendon, long braised unto jelly and filling the mouth with the essence of baby cow, and another plate dressed with tiny shards of suckling pig and alongside it a ham consomm\u00e9 bobbing with cubes of melon. But that is almost it on the animal-protein front. Few of the dishes are complex. They rarely attempt to make an impact through weird unimagined flavour pairings. It's about intensity and delivery. </p> <p>Does everything work? No, not entirely, and it's the weirdest that fail most. We are served a plate of a very sour Colombian fruit with the texture of mango that is then dressed with a pile of 'tagliatelle' made from frozen foie-gras fat. It has a curious, even unpleasant, cheesy back taste. There is another dish of a coconut cream and jelly which tastes of not very much at all. But those two duds \u2013 and there were only two \u2013 were more than can-celled out by the highs. Best of all: a crisp wafer of bitter chocolate laid with a game mousse \u2013 an oddly established combination these days \u2013 the flavour of which just went on and on. Stephen and I stared at each other across the table, our lips closed, and then silently began giggling, at a shared, if wistful joke. </p> <p>And all of this at a beautifully steady pace, as if a metronome were setting the rhythm of our meal. We were never without something to eat for more than a couple of minutes. We felt looked after, cared for, nurtured. The food we had been served may well have been at the very cutting edge, but the effect it achieved spoke to the eternal verities and virtues of great restaurants. And if that makes it sound like dinner at elBulli had sent me off on one, propelled me towards the pseuds'-corner realms of adolescent poetry and lovesick devotion, well, guilty as charged. What can I tell you? I'd had a good dinner. </p> <p>I do not get to speak to Adri\u00e0 again that evening. He is too busy seeing out the performances for the other diners who started later than us, but I keep thinking about something he had said that afternoon. 'I don't cook for other people,' he told me. 'I cook for myself.' It is, he says, all about happiness, his own and that of his diners. 'The happiness is the challenge which pushes us forward. It would be quite sad if we couldn't make people happy.' As our cab navigates the hairpins at frightening speed, I sit back in my seat, a picture of calm, and I conclude that I am very happy indeed. Ferran Adri\u00e0's work for the day is done. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Read more from Jay Rayner on meeting Adri\u00e0 and let us know what you think <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/oct/16/restaurants-restaurants\">on the blog <br></a></p>",
  "<p>It's worth stepping back and just keeping in mind the electoral college math that's likely to be at work here.</p> <p>It now appears, emphasis on appears, that Obama has all the states John Kerry won pretty well nailed down. New Hampshire was in doubt for a while but doesn't seem to be now. Those states come to 252 electoral votes.</p> <p>It also appears that he has two 2004 Bush states pretty well locked up, Iowa and New Mexico. Iowa has been in the Obama category for a while. New Mexico hasn't, and you'll still see it called a swing state on TV, but Obama seems to have <a href=\"http://www.electoral-vote.com/\">a double-digit lead there now</a>. They give Obama another 12 electoral votes, for 264.</p> <p>That's just six EV's away. So, consider all these battleground states: Florida (27), Ohio (20), North Carolina (15), Virginia (13), Missouri (11), Indiana (11), Colorado (9). That's seven states. Obama needs to win just one of them -- any one of the seven puts him over the top. So looked at this way, the bottom really would have to fall out, especially given that he has narrow leads in about five of these states.</p> <p>I've seen McCain and Palin in Pennsylvania in the last week and thought, \"What are they still doing there?\" The <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">polls say</a> it's 10, 12, 15 points. </p> <p>But if you think of the electoral map, the importance of Pennsylvania to McCain is obvious. It's 21 EV's. If lightning could strike and he could somehow pick it off, then Obama has a more difficult path. So that's why he still hangs around there.</p> <p>I say all this because you will hear people say things like \"Can Obama win Ohio <em>and </em>Florida?\" or \"Can Obama carry half of these swing states?\" But, assuming he holds the Kerry states plus Iowa and New Mexico, he doesn't have to do those things.<br></p>",
  "<p>As the growing season starts in Bolivia, thousands of families are struggling to cope with droughts in five of nine regions. The lack of water threatens to destroy a significant part of this year's staple cereal crop, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa\">quinoa</a>. </p> <p>Some farmers have begun growing drought-resistant crops, like Brazil nuts, to adapt to this change in climate. (Bolivia now exports 75% of the world's Brazil nuts, compared to just 20% from Brazil.) These efforts have been painfully slow, however, because they require not only fresh investment, but also expensive research to determine which parts of the country will be most vulnerable to droughts \u2013 and flooding. In other words, knowing what to prepare for, when to do it and where. </p> <p>It is worth pointing out that Bolivia as a nation is responsible for less than 0.1% of the global emissions of carbon dioxide. This is mainly because it is the poorest country in South America and relatively under-developed as a result.</p> <p>Clearly, to pull itself out of poverty, Bolivia needs to develop. The challenge will be to implement a development strategy that takes carbon emissions into account. I am a climate change adviser for <a href=\"http://www.cipca.org.bo/\">CIPCA</a>, which works with indigenous farmers around the country to help them improve their yields and adapt to climate change. In the UK, we receive support from<a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/\">Christian Aid</a>, which is lobbying heavily in Europe for tighter controls on emissions.</p> <p>It is good news that the British government yesterday pledged to cut UK emissions by 80% by 2050. But it is also important that the EU agrees to a strong target \u2013 at least the 30% cut by 2020 currently being discussed. I have come to London to take part in Christian Aid's <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/ActNow/Countdown-to-Copenhagen-climate-change/Index.aspx\">Countdown to Copenhagen</a> campaign to lobby the British government to push for a fair climate deal at the UN summit in Copenhagen in December next year.</p> <p>In Bolivia, there is a growing political awareness that we too need to develop in an environment-friendly way. Nonetheless, there is also recognition that no development is entirely free of environmental consequences. Bolivia is already feeling the consequences of other countries' carbon-heavy development, and many feel that it should not be doubly jeopardized by having its own development unduly constrained by environmental concerns.</p> <p>An idea which is gaining currency is the <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/ActNow/Countdown-to-Copenhagen-climate-change/Index.aspx\">Greenhouse Development Rights Framework</a>, which basically argues that countries must cut their emissions and pay for adaptation measures in relation to the amount they have emitted in the past. In other words, Bolivia has less responsibility for creating the problem, so it should receive more help in solving it.</p> <p>Bolivia, at the heart of the South American continent is a country with a comparatively substantial proportion of its population \u2013 around 40% -\u2013 still living in rural areas and depending mainly on traditional small-scale farming activities. This, along with a poor development of its economy and extremely high income inequalities (partly as a result of decades of having applied the IMF and World Bank liberalisation policies) has contributed to a high degree of vulnerability in the country as a whole. In La Paz, for example, scientists fear that the accelerated melting of the Andean ice caps will mean that there is not enough water to supply the city by 2009. The only way to combat this is to build large reservoirs to capture water in the rainy season for use in the dry season. But this costs money, which the government does not currently have.</p> <p>The great challenges ahead for Bolivia will be skilfully managing its key natural resources \u2013 its huge reserves of natural gas, in particular \u2013 and reinvesting the revenues in improving basic services such as health care, education and public infrastructure. Bolivia has the potential to lead the way in redefining the concept and paradigm of development. </p> <p>Unfortunately political unrest over constitutional reform threatens to derail this process. The moneyed elite in the eastern lowlands are pressing for greater autonomy after the government announced it will redistribute land and petroleum royalties to the country's indigenous majority.</p> <p>Last month, tensions over the constitution erupted into violence with 30 people killed in the northern province of Pando. I hope this conflict is not allowed to scupper Bolivia's development.</p>",
  "<p>Although the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1077816/The-BBC-tackle-Islam-differently-Christianity-admits-Director-General.html\">headlines</a> majored on the BBC's fearful relationship with Islam, there was another point hidden in the BBC director general's <a href=\"http://campaigndirector.moodia.com/Client/Theos/Files/MarkThompsonSpeech.doc\">speech</a> to the Theos Christian thinktank this week, and it is just as disturbing.</p> <p>Those of us who have wondered why there is such a ridiculous excess of religion on the BBC now have the answer. It is because Mark Thompson, an enthusiastic Catholic, wants it. Thompson is a great proselytiser for his faith in the mould of Lord Reith, who thought the BBC was \"the nation's church\". And, of course, the BBC gives him a very big pulpit to preach from \u2013 one that reaches into just about every home in the country, and which we all have to pay for.</p> <p>Thompson told Theos that there are now more religious programmes on BBC TV and radio than there have been for decades \u2013 whereas coverage has almost disappeared from ITV. </p> <p>\"My view,\" he told the thinktank, \"is that there is a difference between the position of Christianity, which I believe should be central to the BBC's religion coverage and widely respected and followed.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What Christian identity feels like to the broad population is a little bit different to people for whom their religion is also associated with an ethnic identity which has not been fully integrated. There's no reason why any religion should be immune from discussion, but I don't want to say that all religions are the same. To be a minority I think puts a slightly different outlook on it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He added that demographers predicted an increase in the number of Christians, Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs over the next 20 years, and a fall in the number of those who profess no religion or consider themselves atheists. Religion, he said, is back.</p> <p>Religion is indeed back, but not in the way Thompson would have us believe. It is certainly crazier and more violent than it has been for a long time and there is no way we can ignore its terrifying extremists, but there is no popular revival of religious belief \u2013 certainly not in Britain. A <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hors270.pdf \">Home Office citizenship survey</a> in 2001 showed that when respondents were asked: \"What says something important about you if you were describing yourself?\", religion came just ninth in the list of priorities. </p> <p>Even more significantly, four times as many thought religion was not important to their identity as those who did. The idea that most people's lives are motivated by religion is simply not true. The most comprehensive and trusted annual study of religious statistics, <a href=\"http://www.eden.co.uk/shop/religious-trends-6-2006-2007-pb-123867.html\">Religious Trends</a>, predicts that by 2040 half the population will identify itself as non-religious (up from 22% in 2001). Similarly church membership will have dropped from 7% of the population in 2001 to 5% in 2040 (with only 2% actually attending services \u2013 and most of them over 65).These are conservative estimates, and the reality is likely to be a whole lot worse for the churches. Certainly Islam is growing, and is predicted to grow further \u2013 from 1.8% of the population to 3.6% \u2013 but that will be almost entirely from reproduction and immigration, not because vast numbers of people are converting to Islam.</p> <p>The only group that <a href=\"http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/paul07/paul07_index.html\">is growing</a> \u2013 and growing rapidly \u2013 are those who say either they have no religion or that they don't believe in God. Yet this group hardly gets a mention on the BBC.</p> <p>As for Thompson's claim that there is a mighty audience for religious programmes, I draw his attention to a <a href=\"http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/psb_review/annrep/psb07/psb07.pdf\">survey</a> by Ofcom, the media regulator, which showed that religious programmes were not greatly valued by viewers \u2013 only 5% found them to be of any personal significance. Other research from Social Capital <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/may/01/raceandreligion.broadcasting\">showed</a> that in homes that had access to digital channels, there was an almost total flight from channels showing religious programmes.</p> <p>Thompson added: \"The fact that the same licence fee is levied from every household means that all audiences are of equal value to us. There is no specially favoured demographic, no premium market.\" </p> <p>Oh, give us a break! A few sentences later he says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I believe that the BBC has maintained the daily and weekly presence of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/\">religion on its services</a> with more consistency and commitment over decades than any other British media organisation, and also more than most of the rest of what you could call public Britain. This year we celebrated the 80th anniversary of the launch of the Daily Service. Songs of Praise, Choral Evensong, Thought For The Day, Prayer For The Day: the reflection of the cycle of the Christian week and the Christian year is there for anyone who wants to find it. So too \u2013 though admittedly less prominently \u2013 reflections of some of the key festivals of the UK's other major faiths. It's hard to square any of this with the idea of the BBC as the anti-God squad.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I remember meeting Thompson at the BBC some years ago in connection with the <a href=\"http://www.secularism.org.uk/\">National Secular Society</a>'s campaign to open up Thought for the Day to non-religious voices. He appeared to listen sympathetically to our point of view, but, of course, nothing happened. It is clear now that for all his vague promises, he had no intention of doing anything about the situation. This speech shows he holds non-believers in contempt.</p> <p>However, these latest revelations answer a question that we at the NSS has been asking for years: why, when all the research shows that hardly anyone wants to watch it, is the BBC absolutely awash with religion, particularly Christianity? It is all down to Thompson and his <a href=\"http://www.secularism.org.uk/bbcthinksitsjobistopromotereligi.html\">sidekick</a> Mark Damazer, the controller of Radio 4.</p> <p>It is disgraceful that these zealots should have their hands so tightly round the throat of the BBC and use their positions to promote their personal beliefs at licence-payers' expense. The NSS intends to make a complaint to the board of directors of the BBC about Thompson's blatant bias.</p>",
  "<p>The number of migrants coming into the UK must be curbed and subject to strict limitations because of the economic crisis, according to the immigration minister Phil Woolas.</p> <p>The increasingly tough economic conditions and people losing their jobs made the immigration issue \"extremely thorny\", he told the Times. The government would not allow the population to expand endlessly, he said.</p> <p>\"It's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it's going to get harder,\" Woolas said.</p> <p>A cap on immigration would be needed should numbers rise above a certain point, Woolas said, which would mean changes to the points-based system introduced to attract migrants considered valuable to the economy.</p> <p>\"This government isn't going to allow the population to go up to 70 million,\" he said. </p> <p>\"There has to be a balance between the number of people coming in and the number of people leaving.\"</p> <p>Woolas's comments are in contrast to ministers who have previously resisted calls for an overall limit on immigration.</p> <p>Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said he would be \"astonished\" at a Labour immigration minister \"in effect changing the policy\".</p> <p>\"His predecessor and the home secretary have made it very clear they do not support a quota,\" Vaz said.</p> <p>Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the population grew by nearly 2 million people to 60,975,000 between 2001 and 2007.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said that the point-based system provided a \"powerful and flexible\" set of controls which could be adapted according to business needs.</p> <p>\"Our tough new Australian(-style) points system plus our plans for newcomers to earn their citizenship will reduce overall numbers of economic migrants coming to Britain and the numbers awarded permanent settlement,\" she said.<br> \"Crucially the points system means only the migrants with the skills Britain needs can come - and no more.\"</p> <p>Keith Best, the chief executive of the Immigration Advisory Service, said quotas were not workable in a modern trading economy. </p> <p>\"What we want to see is migration benefiting the economic and social needs of the UK, and unfortunately when politicians start interfering, you end up with a command and control economy that we used to see in eastern Europe before the fall of communism,\" Best said.</p> <p>The former Labour minister Frank Field, who has called for tougher controls on immigration, said the government's position was \"moving step by step\".</p> <p>\"I think the key thing that we must now look to the government for is that they break the link between coming here to work and getting citizenship, thereby growing the population by creating more citizens,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p> <p>Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of anti-immigration group Migrationwatch said Woolas was the first Labour minister to link immigration and the population.</p> <p>\"If they succeed in delivering, they will have done our country a considerable service,\" he said.</p> <p>Habib Rahman, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \"This could drive a coach and horses through any notion of managed migration through the government's new points-based system \u2026 on which it held long and detailed consultations before unveiling it as the answer to the country's economic needs.\"</p>",
  "<p>Day 6. Talking to people and watching the media as we make our way across the Southwest, it sometimes feels as if the election is over and Barack Obama has nothing left to do but pack up for his move to the White House. Even as the Democratic nominee warns his legions not to get complacent, John McCain already looks like a sour old loser. Sarah Palin, once the emblem of right-wing populism, is all but invisible to anyone but the crowds who appear at her increasingly virulent rallies; about the only thing that can save her from oblivion is tonight's appearance on Saturday Night Live. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com\">Fivethirtyeight.com</a>, the hot projections site, is today projecting a veritable Obama landslide: 56.6 to 41.4 percent in the popular vote and 349.2 to 188.8 in the electoral college. It also says that Democrats could come out with a 15-seat lead in the Senate. RealClearPolitics, which averages all the national polls, is showing Obama with a more modest 6.9 point lead, but a stronger advantage in the electoral college. States like North Carolina and Nevada and even West Virginia, which McCain should have locked up long ago, are now classified as toss-ups. Four key states that Bush won last time\u2014Iowa, Virginia, Colorado, and New Mexico\u2014are at least leaning Democratic. </p> <p>In these and other swing states, Obama's disciplined ranks of youthful activists have invaded town after town. No one has seen this sort of political mobilization since the New Right rose to power in the Reagan Revolution in 1980.<br> Last night, after a 350-mile drive across the high desert from Sedona, Arizona, we entered the capital of the swing state among swing states: Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 2004, George W. Bush beat John Kerry here by just under 6,000 votes. In 2000, Al Gore beat Bush by only 366 votes. Before that, the state went for Clinton in his winning years, and George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan in theirs. According to RCP, Obama is now leading here by just over 8 points. </p> <p>The partisan breakdown varies wildly in different parts of the state: Down in the southeastern corner, on the Texas border, the Republican share of the vote can run as high as 70 to 80%; in the northern mountains, around wealthy, New Age Taos, the split is just the opposite. Bernalillo County, where we are now, is the most populous in the state, with more than 600,000 residents. It is also key to Obama's strategy this year. The campaign's aim is to run up such wide margins here (15,000-20,000) that McCain can't catch him even if he does well further south. And the Democrats aren't conceding the south, either, as Joe Biden arrived in the state for a rally down in Mesilla.</p> <p>Joe Monahan, the savvy local blog editor who runs <a href=\"http://www.joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/\">New Mexico Politics with Joe Monahan</a>, points out the Latinos make up a substantial slice of the population in New Mexico, some 44%. They are trending strongly toward Obama, but <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-newmexico16-2008oct16,0,3999043.story\u2014by \">a fifth remain undecided some accounts</a>, because of the conflict between progressive economic positions and conservative social views. The GOP's position in this community wasn't helped by the unexpected demise of Bernalillo County Republican Party chairman Fernando C. de Baca, who stepped down last month after telling a BBC reporter: \"The truth is that Hispanics came here as conquerors. African-Americans came here as slaves. Hispanics consider themselves above blacks. They won't vote for a black president.\" </p> <p>Native Americans are a higher percentage of the total here than in any other state, though still only about 10%. With margins as small as they have been in recent years, however, the <a href=\"http://nativetimes.bizweb5.tulsaconnect.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=195&amp;Itemid=28\">Native American vote could make a difference</a>. They usually voting in low numbers, but Obama has opened a campaign office on the Navajo reservation, and more near Pueblo and other Indian communities, and has won the endorsement of many tribal leaders. </p> <p>There is a solid McCain vote among those who work for Sandia Laboratories and on Kirkland Air Force base, and in much of the south, Joe Monahan says--but even there, cracks have appeared in a once-reliable Republican base. And the Democrats have registered some 35,000 new voters, far outstripping the Republicans\u2014though the \"voting fraud\" challenges have already begun here, as they have in other battleground states. (I'll be writing more vote about suppression tactics in New Mexico tomorrow.)</p> <p>All this may explain why the GOP is flying in Sarah Palin, who is to appear on Sunday at an airport hangar in Roswell. Maybe she can put things back together again, or at the very least stem the Obama tide. Roswell is of course notorious as the site of a supposed UFO crash in 1947, that left behind spaceship debris and alien corpses. (The U.S. military said the debris was from an experimental surveillance balloon, but believers insist this was a cover story.) </p> <p>With our editors working late into the night, we'll be posting two new videos tomorrow. Part of our team has already headed out for Colorado Springs, to take a look at its famous evangelical Christian community, and the rest of us will be following tomorrow, north on Route 25. But along the way we'll be stopping off in Santa Fe and some smaller towns, to check out the rallies and marches taking place all over New Mexico, aimed at getting people to take part in early voting, which begins tomorrow in locations all over the state.</p>",
  "<p>Race in America isn't simply a black and white issue. Here in New Mexico it's a black-brown issue, with tensions between the state's Hispanic community and African-Americans as well as between Hispanics and newer Mexican immigrants.</p> <p>It is those tensions that claimed a Republican leader last month after a blog-driven uproar over comments about whether the state's Hispanics would vote for Barack Obama.</p> <p>Demographically, New Mexico is unique. No ethnic group makes up a majority of the population, and the state is one of a handful of \"minority majority\" states in the US, said Trip Jennings, the news editor for the <a href=\"http://newmexicoindependent.com\">New Mexico Independent</a>. It makes the racial dynamics of the state more complex than most states in the US. <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/35000.html\">Hispanics make up 44% of the population</a>, Native Americans 10%, African-Americans a small percentage and the rest of the population is whites or Anglos as they are commonly referred to in the Southwest, Trip said.</p> <p>Even within the Hispanic community, there are divisions. The fact that the word Hispanic, or Hispano, is still commonly used sets New Mexico apart from other states. Hispanic fell out of use because it refers to someone of Spanish descent. The broader term Latino is more common in the US now. But many Hispanics in northern New Mexico still use this term because they trace their ancestry to the <a href=\"http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Francisco-V%C3%A1squez-de-Coronado\">Spanish conquistadors, who first came</a> to the area in the 16th Century. There is a tension between Hispanics who have been here for hundreds of years and newer Mexican immigrants, and there are historical tensions between Hispanics and the Native American nations here.</p> <p>These racial issues took the spotlight after comments by the chairman of the Republican Party of Bernalillo County, which includes the state's largest city, Albuquerque. Last month, a BBC reporter quoted Fernando C de Baca in a blog post as saying that \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/talkingamerica/2008/09/the_sound_of_ranchera_and.html\">Hispanics consider themselves above blacks</a>\". Mr C de Baca added:</p> <blockquote> <p>The truth is that Hispanics came here as conquerors. African-Americans came here as slaves. Hispanics consider themselves above blacks. They won't vote for a black president.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that his <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jHDrn1zIz7ZMmOW2UM_Fv-kRamcAD93E2PA80\">comments were taken out of context</a> and that he wasn't <a href=\"http://news21blog.org/2008/09/26/battle-for-the-west-nm-foot-in-mouth/\">referring to his own beliefs</a> but rather those of Hispanics who grew up before the Civil Rights movement. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MQLKGdtL2vQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/MQLKGdtL2vQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/MQLKGdtL2vQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\" /></object> </figure>   <p>\"That stirred a whole hornet's nest of controversy,\" Trip Jennings said.<br>Despite his claims that his comments were taken out of context, he was forced to step down.</p> <p>Trip says based on reporting on his site that some, albeit a small minority of the Hispanic community, still feel some animosity towards African-Americans. This minority of the Hispanic community feel that blacks \"got a bigger piece of the pie\" due to the Civil Rights movement, Trip said.</p> <p>These views have also been expressed by Democrats. Earlier this year, a Democratic <a href=\"http://newmexicoindependent.com/2238/racial-tensions-between-hispanos-and-blacks-real-or-imagined\">state senator Mary Jane Garcia here told the Rocky Mountain News</a> in neighbouring Colorado:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I don't know one single Hispanic over 50 who will cast a vote for Obama.\" She also conceded that \"there have always been conflicts between blacks and browns.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In the primary races, <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/07/09/obama_looks_to_power_of_latino.html\">Barack Obama lost the Hispanic vote by 61 to 35 percent</a> to rival Hillary Clinton. But polls show that <a href=\"http://newmexicoindependent.com/5072/todays-top-stories-obamas-support-in-nm-strongest-among-older-hispanics\">Barack Obama is doing well with Hispanics</a> which might be one of the reasons that recent <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nm/new_mexico_mccain_vs_obama-448.html\">polls give him a lead in this state</a> that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/nm/\">George Bush won by the narrowest of margins in 2004</a>.</p>"
