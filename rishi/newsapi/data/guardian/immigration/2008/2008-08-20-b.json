  "<p>A couple of months ago I came up with an excellent money saving wheeze. I'd club together with a bunch of foodie mates and buy a whole lamb carcass from my favourite butcher for around \u00a350. We'd get together over a few beers, cut it up ourselves and freeze the bits. Job done - best part of two hundred quid saved. I started calling around. <br> After working my way through the relevant section of my phone book it became quickly and bewilderingly apparent that no-one I know has a freezer; at least nothing beyond a tiny thing for keeping vodka cold and making ice. Not a single one of them, and bear in mind these are people who love to cook, had a full-sized chest or upright freezer. What on earth was going on?<br>When questioned, a lot of them mentioned <a href=\"http://www.iceland.co.uk/\">Iceland</a> in appalled tones. Something about the ubiquity of their ads (particularly the abominable 'driving home for Christmas'), thoughts of frozen <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/mar/23/broadcasting1\">turkey twizzlers</a> and an entire Christmas dinner for \u00a39.99. Some talked about their own parents, about stained fingers at the <a href=\"http://www.pickyourown.info/\">PYO farm</a>, Mum endlessly blanching veg and uninspiring dinners of freezer-burned runner beans. <br> <br>The Technicals - the deep food-geeks - waffled about ice crystals damaging cell structures. There were other excuses too but the real reason seemed clear: the whole idea of freezing is just a bit too naff for the fashionable modern food lover.</p> <p>Fortunately normal people don't seem to have such prejudices. According to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/21/foodanddrink.food\">story in today's Guardian</a>, the specialist frozen food retailers are seeing sales go up while regular supermarkets are suffering. Perhaps foodies are put off by the associations with thrift or a perception that low cost food is low quality, but anyone with a family to feed on a shrinking budget sees it as a distinctly smart idea.</p> <p>Frankly, I just don't get it. I love my freezer. With bulk-made dishes, gluts from market or garden, coffee beans, leftovers and ice-cream I sometimes don't even have space for the vodka. Then there are the small quantities of things that I just couldn't keep to hand without the freezer, cubes of frozen cream, wine, stock, demi-glace, chopped fresh herbs, chunks of pancetta, horseradish root and lime leaves. Though it would be nice to have a root cellar, an apple shed, a still room, a game larder and a small dairy, my freezer does duty for all of them - and doesn't contain a single turkey twizzler.</p> <p>So what's wrong with us? While the nation's mums have gone to Iceland, have foodies really forgotten the freezer?</p>",

Angela Gordon and her partner, Junaid Abuhamza, are also accused of \"causing or allowing\" the death of Khyra Ishaq, who was pronounced dead after paramedics were called to her Birmingham home in May. Gordon, 33, and Abuhamza, 29, both of Leyton Road, Handsworth, were remanded in custody and will next appear at the city's crown court on November 4, when they are scheduled to enter pleas to all the charges against them.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Blogger who wrote about leukaemia battle dies</h2> <p>Adrian Sudbury, the 27-year-old journalist turned blogger who chronicled his battle against leukaemia, died early yesterday. The Nottingham journalist's Baldy Blogger website has been flooded with tributes. The former Huddersfield Examiner reporter began the blog in March last year. He campaigned for better education about bone marrow donation, taking a petition of 11,000 signatures to Downing Street. The prime minister, Gordon Brown, yesterday paid tribute to him as a \"true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didn't\".<br><strong>Jemima Kiss</strong></p> <h2>Engineer aims to break wind-power speed record</h2> <p>A British engineer, Richard Jenkins, is hoping to make an attempt on the wind-powered land speed record this week, expecting to reach 120mph on a dry salt lake in the Australian outback, 300 miles from Perth. The current record, 116.7mph, was set by an American in 1999. Jenkins, pictured right, whose hi-tech craft Greenbird has a rigid vertical wing, says he has passed 120mph in practice. If he succeeds in breaking the record he will swap the wheels on his craft for ice skates, and attempt to travel at 150mph in the frozen wilderness of North America.<br><strong>David Adam</strong></p> <h2>Reheating tomato sauce aids anti-cancer role</h2> <p>Reheating tomato sauce can enhance its anti-cancer properties, researchers at Ohio State University in Columbus say. Previous research has shown that lycopene, an antioxidant in tomatoes, can help to prevent cancers. Reheating the sauce in combination with oil changed the molecular structure so the lycopene was more easily transported into the bloodstream and body tissues, the study leader, Dr Steven Schwartz, told the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia. In a trial people had more lycopene in their blood after eating the processed sauce than after eating ordinary tomato sauce.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>'Irreplaceable' papers lost in blaze at library</h2> <p>A fire which destroyed a library and around 27,000 books was being investigated by the police and fire service yesterday. Plympton public library in Devon was destroyed in the blaze, which broke out just after 4am. A Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said the timber library, built in the mid-60s, was \"totally gutted\". Plymouth city council said the fire in the single-storey building destroyed \"irreplaceable\" documents relating to local history . \"Some of the history of Plympton has gone up in flames,\" said a spokesman.

Margaret Wilkins (latterly Sainsbury) died on August 10, aged 73, her fame rooted in being Britain's \"first reality TV star\". The series drew more than 10 million viewers and illuminated working-class life for the first time on television. \"She was the head of a wonderful and interesting family who taught the middle classes to reassess their lives and how they viewed the so-called working class. She was brilliant,\" said Watson.

The broadcaster has been considering holding a talent search to replace Vorderman, as <a href=\"htttp://MediaGuardian.co.uk\">MediaGuardian.co.uk</a> revealed last month, after the long-serving presenter's resignation. Channel 4 said the talent search was open to all, with no previous television experience necessary.

She was elected MP for Keighley in 1997 and has campaigned on issues including forced marriage, domestic violence and honour killings. Cryer was a driving force behind a law enabling courts to intervene in cases of forced marriages which comes into effect next month. The 68-year-old told Labour party members she had decided to stand down \"mainly concerning my age, health and decreasing energy\".

  "<p>It's a wet afternoon in Anstruther and James Yorkston is perched on the bonnet of his car looking out to sea, blinking through the rain as he works his way through a vinegary bag of chips. It's a perfect setting for this returning folk hero - a man whose romantic songs are grounded in briny, everyday details. The musician has just moved back home from Edinburgh to the East Neuk of Fife, to be closer to King Creosote's highly influential Fence Collective, the group of local musicians with whom he grew up and which spawned, among others, the Beta Band and KT Tunstall.</p> <p>Yorkston laughs gently as raindrops collect in his sparse ginger hair. \"I love this place. When I moved back here, it was like that phrase old Scottish ladies say, 'Ooh, it's like a weiiiight has been taken off my shoulders!'\" He smiles. \"There was no background noise, no interference. My head was clear. I feel more disconnected from the music business than ever - in a good way. I'm purely thinking about the writing rather than anything else.\" </p> <p>And what writing it is. Over four subtle, gorgeous albums, Yorkston has helped broaden the reach of folk music in the 21st century, somehow managing to please the old folk guard, lovers of experimental music and the indie fan. Take his new album, Where the Haar Rolls In: not only does it include contributions from folk giants Norma and Mike Waterson, but it shimmers with the sounds of bouzoukis, prepared pianos (altered by placing objects on or between the strings) and even wine glasses. And it also comes with an endorsement from Radiohead's drummer, Phil Selway. \"Listening to James Yorkston's music is like coming across the interesting-looking person on the fringes of the party,\" he says.</p> <p>But Yorkston wasn't always quiet. In his youth, his tastes were raucous and his spirit rebellious. Born in 1971, he loved punk and hardcore groups such as the Damned, Agent Orange and Dag Nasty. He played in \"noisy, distorted guitar bands\" and spent his 20s doing odd jobs in bookshops and hotels while trying to hit the big time in groups called Miraclehead and Huckleberry. By the time he was 28, he'd had enough. He opted for what he calls self-imposed exile: going back to school to study, dropping the bands, and making music just for himself. \"It was desperation,\" he says over a lager after we've moved to a pub. \"It was a case of telling myself: you've got to grow up, go and study, make a career, and just record things at home on your guitar. If the songs don't go anywhere, at least you'll have a nice reminder of your youth.\" He smiles. \"Thankfully, things didn't turn out that way.\" </p> <p>Yorkston started to explore. He went back to the traditional songs of his childhood holidays in Cork and started spending more time in Anstruther, inspired by his friends' approach to music-making. Watching the likes of Kenny Anderson, the founder of Fence and also known as King Creosote, and his brother Gordon, a founder of the Beta Band, Yorkston was struck by their \"music that was so loose and so open. I suddenly realised this was the way music should be done.\"</p> <p>So in 1999, Yorkston recorded some demos, including the song Moving Up Country, Roaring the Gospel, still a staple of his live shows. He sent a tape to John Peel, who played it: \"I was ecstatic. Peel said it was his favourite song title of the year.\" Things started to happen. Yorkston recorded a Peel session and Scottish label Bad Jazz released Moving Up Country as a single. The mighty John Martyn then asked Yorkston to support him on a 27-date tour, and soon Yorkston was signed to Domino Records. His first album, also called Moving Up Country, was an instant critical success, becoming the Rough Trade chain's album of 2002.</p> <p>The title When the Haar Rolls In is an honest reflection of the despair Yorkston has felt in his life: the haar is the North Sea fog that often swamps Anstruther. \"Imagine the combination of a vicious dry ice machine and air conditioning that soaks you to the skin,\" says Yorkston. \"It always comes, it's just a question of when.\" He follows this dour observation with a smile, reflecting how the woe in his songs - which crackle with the brutal honesty of folk - is always tempered by wit.</p> <p>Such admissions aside, this is a good time in Yorkston's life. Last year, he got married; next month, they're expecting their first baby. Yorkston also seems liberated by the fact that Domino has allowed him to produce this album himself, after the Cocteau Twins' Simon Raymonde helped him with Moving Up Country. So is he pleased everything is going his way? He laughs. \"That's one way to put it. More than anything, though, I do feel free. I'm not worried, I feel calm. Everything is going as it should\" \u00b7</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Where the Haar Rolls In is released on September 1.

  "<p>Gary Glitter was refused entry to Hong Kong from Thailand last night after Thai officials had earlier failed to persuade the disgraced singer to board a flight to London. He had been due to arrive in Britain yesterday after being deported from Vietnam having served a sentence for child abuse, but the glam rock star refused to board a connecting flight to London after the plane touched down in Bangkok. </p> <p>The 64-year-old singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was released by Vietnam after serving two years and nine months of a three-year sentence for sexually abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11.</p> <p>He claimed to have had a heart attack in a hotel room in \"no man's land\" between disembarkation and immigration at Bangkok airport, but after he was seen by a doctor his demands to be taken to hospital were rejected. He spent some 20 hours in the transit lounge as Thai officials tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to board a flight to London.</p> <p>Colonel Puttipong Musikul, of the Thai immigration police, said Gadd had been in \"a great mood, laughing and chatting with our negotiators\", who were trying to persuade him to change his mind.</p> <p>Just before 10pm local time, he finally boarded a flight to Hong Kong. The Chinese authorities later informed their UK counterparts that they had barred him from entry after his arrival in Hong Kong. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Foreign Office in London said: \"It is a matter for the Chinese authorities to decide what action they take now.\" Sources said the Chinese authorities were considering returning Gadd to Thailand. Officials in Bangkok had earlier been adamant that he could not enter Thailand and had threatened to put him in a detention centre if he refused to leave the country.</p> <p>On his arrival in Thailand Gadd had refused to get on the plane for Britain, claiming he was being harassed by the media. \"I am not getting back on the plane with all the press there,\" he said. \"And I'm not going to London. You can't make me. I have done my time. I am a free man.\"</p> <p>News that Gadd has successfully evaded attempts to send him back to the UK is a blow to child protection charities and the government. A Home Office spokeswoman said that the government could not force him to return, and denied claims that he had been able to avoid returning to the UK after the Home Office issued him with a passport in November last year, while he was still in jail. The spokeswoman said Gadd had been issued with a passport in 2002 and the only method by which the government could remove an individual's passport was through the use of the royal prerogative, which was used \"mainly on national security grounds\".</p> <p>If and when he arrives in the UK, he will be met at the airport by police officers and served with an order which effectively will put him on the sex offenders' register.</p> <p>As Gadd was refusing to board the plane to Britain, Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on the movements of paedophiles, including increasing from six months to five years the duration of travel orders which prevent convicted paedophiles from travelling abroad. She had earlier told GMTV that Gadd was \"despicable\", and said it was \"pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again\". </p> <p>Gadd was convicted of downloading child pornography in the UK in 1999 after a computer repair shop found more than 4,000 images on his laptop. He served two months of a four-month sentence.</p> <p>He then left the country and moved to Spain and Cuba before travelling to south-east Asia. He was expelled from Cambodia in 2002 after the government deemed he posed \"a threat to the security of the country\".</p> <p>He was arrested in November 2005 as he tried to board a flight to Thailand from Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Gadd was investigated on suspicion of rape of minors, but only charged with obscene acts. He pleaded innocent, claiming he was teaching the two girls English, but was convicted and sentenced to three years in jail in March 2006.</p> <p>The one-time star known for his silver jump suits and platform heels had a string of hits in the 1970s, including I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am).</p>",
  "<p>Frozen food has an image problem. It's not only because Kerry Katona, face of Britain's leading freezer centre chain, Iceland, is the world's most-hated woman, according to a recent online poll of British women, the fourth most-hated woman in Britain, according to another survey, and the woman who appeared (with Jason Donovan) in the second most hated British TV ad. It's also because those frozen packages, stacked high and sold cheap, are not alluring. \"Frozen food displays appallingly because the freezer section is usually at the back of a store and because you just don't look at boxes covered in frost and go, 'Yum yum',\" says Ed Garner of market researchers TNS Worldpanel.</p> <p>And yet, according to TNS's latest analysis of the grocery market, published this week, frozen food sales are rising. Sales at Iceland, which has 724 UK stores, rose by 14.4% in the 12 weeks to August 10, while other British freezer centres experienced a 20.4% rise. And in supermarkets, frozen food sales have risen too: according to Datamonitor, the UK frozen food category has seen a 5% year-on-year rise, which is above average growth.</p> <p>What is going on? Is this a new ice age? Is the credit squeeze making us buy cheap and sometimes cheerless frozen stuff? Have frozen foods overcome some of their image problems? Has the myth that notionally fresh food is nutritionally superior to frozen food been exploded? Are we getting a taste for Findus's frozen Lasagne Novelli, with its unique camembert b\u00e9chamel prepared in Newcastle by a Michelin-starred Frenchman? Are chest freezers, those success symbols of the 70s, filling up again in garages around the country as cash-strapped Britons hoard supplies that might help them fill their faces cheaply until the economic upturn? Has Gordon Brown's homily about wasting food got through to people who realise that you can shove unused frozen beans back in the freezer, but that limp fresh beans are only fit for composting? </p> <p>\"All of those factors are involved, but the leading factor is price,\" says Garner. \"If you think about Iceland in particular it has a very strong discount image. A lot of their stores were located near to Kwiksave shops and when that chain closed last year Iceland picked up a lot of business. The new perceptions are that frozen food is great value and there's no waste.\"</p> <p>What impresses Garner is that frozen food is overcoming so many constraints as its icy fingers extend round our hearts. \"For example,\" he says, \"the average Waitrose shopper wouldn't be seen dead in Iceland.\" Not even if they were just looking for frozen organic salmon? \"Perhaps.\" But the constraints are not just image ones. \"Ours has been a convenience culture for so long,\" says Garner. \"When you go to the Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Food at the station on your way home from work, you're likely to buy a chilled ready meal. People want now food, but frozen food doesn't necessarily deliver that, even though it has been sold as convenience food. So as frozen food sales rise it's not about convenience, really: the most important factor is price. Admittedly, when you see three frozen sausages and mash for 89p, you think, 'What the hell is that made of?'\"</p> <p>Britain is being seduced by Kerry Katona's message. No, not the Carry On-style message she gave out when, in one mis-firing ad for Iceland, she picked up a packet of chicken, held it to her chest and asked a shelf-stacker: \"Excuse me, have these breasts been enlarged?\" To which he replied, coyly: \"I wouldn't like to say, madam.\" No, not that one, but her suggestion that mothers frequent its chilly overlit aisles (those high street simulacra of endless Arctic daylight) or stand on the doorstep awaiting the arrival of its refrigerated home delivery service because it's as cheap as chips. \"That's why mums shop at Iceland.\"</p> <p>But price is not the only explanation for frozen food's resurgence. Last year, a range of frozen gourmet meals was launched by Findus, designed by Jean-Christophe Novelli, the self-styled \"nation's favourite French chef\" (suck on that, Raymond Blanc). It targeted not just the Katona demographic of putatively thrifty mums, but dinner-party hosts and hostesses who couldn't be bothered (and, really, why should they?) to knock up a meal from scratch even for those they loved most. Intriguingly, the Novelli-Findus partnership stresses the appliance of science to the problem of ensuring that your thawed main course doesn't arrive on the plate as an ill-defined splodge. \"Jean-Christophe has spent many days and nights in Newcastle at the Findus factory,\" oozes the press release counter-intuitively, \"ensuring every single product meets his high expectations at every stage of the recipe development. Each dish is freshly prepared on site, then fast-frozen in a process that takes just 2\u00bd hours. By comparison, domestic freezers can take as long as 12 hours to complete the process and produce much larger ice crystals that affect the quality of the food when thawed and reheated.\" </p> <p>Novelli's Haddock Mornay features spinach that is \"hand-moulded and carefully placed in the tray; the fish is then positioned on top to protect the spinach; this is then covered with a sauce (that uses fresh double cream) and sprinkled with emmental and cheddar cheese (fresh, of course).\" If only Findus had hired Dervla Kirwan to reprise her sultry M&amp;S ad patter: \"This isn't just frozen spinach, this is hand-moulded frozen spinach.\" But, so far, they haven't.</p> <p>For Garner, this insistence that frozen food can be made superior to some fresh food is important in explaining its success. \"Firms such as Birds Eye have done a great deal to remove the view that frozen food is filled with preservatives and to argue for the view that it's better to have frozen than nominally fresh food that has taken a long while to get to you.\" Clarence Birdseye, the American reckoned to be frozen food's founder, worked in Labrador when the last century was in its teens, and was struck by how the Inuit froze freshly caught fish deep in ice at temperatures of -40C. When thawed it tasted fresh, indeed fresher than the fish he ate in New York. His patented double-belt freezer was aimed to simulate that Inuit sealed-in freshness.</p> <p>Birdseye's philosophy of sealed-in freshness is being reheated for new times. Consider the blurb for Iceland's 1kg bag of mixed vegetables: \"Frozen veg is so handy and healthy too because freezing locks in all the goodness. With this you're never stuck for a bit on the side!\" (Does every Iceland sales pitch involve a lame double entendre?) Consider too the recent success that Young's, the chilled and frozen seafood firm, has had with its relaunch of its Chip Shop range featuring sunflower oil to appeal to health-conscious customers. \"We've added about 700,000 extra households into the brand,\" said Helen Taylor of Young's. \"People who were buying infrequently are consuming it more and buying on a regular basis. People who were potentially rejecting it are now reappraising and trialling.\"</p> <p>Reappraising and trialling - it sounds as though the frozen food industry is skating on thin ice. Will this trend towards frozen food last? \"We don't really make predictions at TNS,\" says Garner, \"but I suspect that the issue of the strength of the trend depends on how long we continue with the credit crunch. At this stage no one really knows how long that will be.\" Which is why, if you have a chest freezer, you should consider stuffing it with frozen mini-kievs and rock-hard organic broccoli tout de suite.</p>",
  "<p>A species of snail with a taste for old buildings has been found for the first time in Britain, in the grounds of one of the country's most famous stately homes. </p> <p>The snail was \u00addiscovered at <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-cliveden\">Cliveden, Buckinghamshire</a>, the estate notorious as the original \u00admeeting-place of John Profumo and Christine Keeler, during the sex and \u00adspying scandal of the 1960s. </p> <p>But far from being a newcomer to the National Trust property the snail appears to have arrived more than a century ago, in a large marble balustrade imported from Italy in 1896. </p> <p>For 112 years the tiny mollusc \u2013 which at just 11mm long (less than half an inch) is about the size of a thumbnail \u2013 went unnoticed.<br> Then this summer a \u00adsharp-eyed \u00advolunteer came across it while cleaning statuary in the grounds of the estate. Realising it was a \u00adspecies that might not have been seen before, the volunteer sent it to Janet Ridout Sharpe, a snail expert based in Oxford. She identified it as \u00ad<em>Papillifera papillaris</em> \u2013 now \u00adnicknamed the Cliveden snail. </p> <p>Detective work revealed that the \u00adbalustrade where the snail colony, of about 100 individuals, was found, had come from the gardens of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Borghese_gardens\">Villa Borghese in Rome</a>. Common around the Mediterranean, this land snail is usually found in ancient buildings, having a preference for limestone and marble. <br> According to Matthew Oates, the National Trust's nature conservation adviser, the discovery reveals just how little we know about the wildlife right under our noses. \"For this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years, despite thousands of people visiting Cliveden every year, is remarkable,\" he said.</p> <p>Alan Stubbs, chairman of <a href=\"http://www.buglife.org.uk/\">Buglife \u2013 The Invertebrate Conservation Trust</a>, agrees. He points out that we do not need to travel to remote rainforests to find undocumented species: \"Britain's wildlife may be the most studied and surveyed in the world, but there are still many creatures so far undiscovered out there for us to find.\"</p> <p>Since 2003, four wildlife species new to Britain have been found on National Trust properties. Now the trust has launched a survey of all its houses and gardens to help in the search for any other so far undetected plants or animals. The organisation is asking visitors to keep an eye out for anything unusual. </p> <p>Many accidental imports, such as the harlequin ladybird, can be harmful to our native wildlife, but the Cliveden snail does not appear to fall into that category. Since the snails first arrived in Britain, more than a century ago, they have only moved from the balustrade to near the house \u2014 a distance of just 27 metres, or about 25cm a year.</p>",
  "<p>The war in Afghanistan is running out of control. The multiple attacks mounted by Taliban guerrillas on Nato occupation troops on Monday and Tuesday - in which 10 newly arrived French soldiers were killed near Kabul and a US base hit by suicide bombers - are the most daring since the US-led invasion of 2001. More than 100 people have been killed in fighting in the past three days, as the war against foreign occupation has spread from the south to the east and the area around the capital.</p> <p>The assault on the French reinforcements follows the killing of nine US soldiers in a single attack last month, and the freeing of hundreds of Taliban prisoners from Kandahar's main jail in a night-time raid in June. As Afghanistan experiences its own Iraq-style surge of US and other Nato forces, the death toll is rising inexorably. The number of occupation troops killed in Afghanistan overtook the Iraqi level in May. Attacks on US-led forces are up by 50% on last year, Nato air attacks have increased 40%, and more than 2,500 have already reportedly lost their lives in the conflict since January - getting on for half of them civilians.</p> <p>In a damning indictment of the impact of Nato's occupation on Afghanistan, aid agencies reported earlier this month that insecurity was spreading to previously stable areas and the killing of civilians by all sides rising sharply. The US air force seems to have developed a particular habit of attacking wedding parties - last month 47 civilians were killed in one strike - while British troops, who lost 13 soldiers in June alone, killed a woman and two children last weekend, which the high command naturally blamed on the Taliban.</p> <p>This is the conflict western politicians have convinced themselves is the \"good war\", in contrast to the shame of Iraq. Britain's defence secretary, Des Browne, recently declared it \"the noble cause of the 21st century\". Nicolas Sarkozy, who faces a similar level of domestic opposition to the Afghan imbroglio as in Britain, insists that France is fighting for \"democracy and freedom\". Barack Obama calls it the \"central front\" in the war on terror and, like Gordon Brown, is committed to transferring troops from Iraq to Afghanistan to bolster the fight.</p> <p>That will certainly jack up the killing and suffering still further. As Zbigniew Brzezinski - the former US national security adviser who masterminded the early stages of the mujahideen war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan - argues, putting more troops in is not the solution: \"We run the risk that our military presence will gradually turn the Afghan population entirely against us.\"</p> <p>The original aims of the invasion, it will be recalled, were the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, and the destruction of al-Qaida in the aftermath of 9/11. None of those aims has been achieved. Instead, the US and its friends brought back to power an alliance of brutal and corrupt warlords, gave them new identities as democrats with phoney elections, and drove the Taliban and al-Qaida leaderships over the border into Pakistan. </p> <p>Far from reducing the threat of terrorism, this crucible of the war on terror has simply spread it around the region, bringing forth an increasingly potent campaign of resistance and giving a new lease of life to a revamped Taliban as a champion of Pashtun nationalism. And as mission creep has detached the Afghan war from its original declared target of al-Qaida - let alone the claims made about women's rights, which have been going into grim reverse again in much of the country under Nato tutelage - it has morphed into the kind of war of \"civilisation\" evoked by Sarkozy and Browne, a certain recipe for conflict without end. No wonder British politicians have talked about digging in for decades.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the long-term cost of the west's shameless support for Pakistan's military dictatorship as the linchpin of its war on terror, while forever preaching democracy, became clearer this week. General Musharraf's welcome departure has left the country in political crisis and exposed the contradictions at the heart of the US relationship with the nuclear-armed state. </p> <p>Even while the Pakistani military has relied on the US alliance to underpin its strategic position with India, its intelligence arm, the ISI, has maintained links with the Taliban as a long-term regional investment - at the same time as the Pakistan army has fought the local Taliban under American pressure. Now the threat of full-scale US incursions against Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan's border areas risks profoundly destabilising one of the most combustible states in the world.</p> <p>Afghanistan was supposed to be a demonstration of Nato's expanded horizons in the post-Soviet new world order. Instead, as with Nato's disastrous engagement with Georgia, it has underscored the dangers of giving the cold war alliance a new imperial brief. The growing conflict must also be added to the litany of US foreign policy failures that have been overseen by George Bush - from Iraq, Iran, Palestine and Lebanon to Latin America and now the Caucasus - and the evident necessity of a new direction.</p> <p>That is likely to be a mountain to climb, even under an Obama presidency. The Afghan war certainly cannot be won, but the bitterly unpopular 2005 agreement for indefinite bases in the country left no doubt that the US is planning to stay for the long haul. Nato's secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, made clear in a speech to the Brookings Institution in Washington earlier this year that western interests in Afghanistan went well beyond good governance to the strategic interest in having a permanent military presence in a state that borders central Asia, China, Iran and Pakistan.</p> <p>The only way to end the war is the withdrawal of foreign troops as part of a political settlement negotiated with all the significant players in the country, including the Taliban, and guaranteed by the regional powers and neighbouring states. A large majority of Afghans say they back negotiations with the Taliban, even in western-conducted opinion polls. The Taliban themselves insist they will only talk once foreign troops have withdrawn. If that were the only obstacle, it could surely be choreographed as a parallel process. But given the scale of commitments made by the US and Nato, the fire of the Afghan war seems bound to spread further.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Even George Burley, who has optimistically spoken of Scotland's aspirations of qualification for the 2010 World Cup, would struggle to take positive results from this encounter. Scotland, without a friendly victory at Hampden Park in a staggering 12 years, showed little sign of ending that miserable run against Northern Ireland last night.</p> <p>Burley can legitimately point to the absence of key performers - Alan Hutton, Paul Hartley and Barry Ferguson among them - but this showing raised more questions than supplied answers. Guile, worryingly for the Scotland manager, was among the aspects so noticeably lacking in his players' display. Burley is still without a victory after three games and seven months in charge of the Scots.</p> <p>Nigel Worthington, conversely, can take satisfaction from Northern Ireland's robust showing which, but for a missed penalty kick, may have returned victory. The Irish even played the remaining 35 minutes with 10 men; onlookers could reasonably have suggested half of that number would have been adequate to keep an impotent Scotland at bay.</p> <p>Burley's pre-match promise of adventure was tempered slightly by a late injury problem sustained by Barry Robson, a blister on the Celtic midfielder's foot becoming infected. Kevin Thomson, a considerably less potent attacking threat, stepped in for his first cap. Scotland's manager had been boosted by the return of James McFadden to the international fold, the Birmingham City striker having missed his country's previous two outings because of injury. McFadden, whose cult status among the Tartan Army is somewhat out of sync with his recent achievements at club level, was handed a free role behind Kenny Miller in the home attack.</p> <p>Northern Ireland, similarly, could not be accused of arriving at Hampden Park with negative tactics in mind. Martin Paterson and Chris Brunt supplied wide support for David Healy, another iconic figure of the international game. While conspicuous for neat passing, the opening half offered little in the way of clear-cut opportunities. A 20-yard race between Miller and Johnny Evans to collect a fine James Morrison through ball was won by the Manchester United defender, before McFadden shot tamely at Maik Taylor. Healy, in reply, scooped over Craig Gordon's crossbar from 22 yards.</p> <p>Despite the manager's noticeable urging of the Scottish team forward, even when not in possession, they lacked the spark normally provided by McFadden to meaningfully impose themselves on proceedings. His 40th-minute overhit pass, intended for Miller, rather summed things up.</p> <p>Robson stepped from the substitutes' bench to replace Thomson during the interval, Scotland's lack of creativity obviously not lost on their manager. The substitute came within inches of reinvigorating a stale encounter almost immediately with a fierce, long-range drive.</p> <p>Controversy, mercifully for neutral observers, followed. Ryan McGivern, who had received a first-half booking for a late challenge on Scott Brown, hauled down the midfielder once again when bearing down on goal. A red card for the Irish player was inevitable, even in such low-key surroundings.</p> <p>Within 60 seconds, the visitors had been afforded a rare sight of goal, and from the penalty spot after Allan McGregor clipped the substitute Warren Feeney. Healy, normally such a composed figure in the green and white of his country, watched his spot-kick superbly saved by McGregor, who even held the striker's low attempt.</p> <p>Matters returned to their hitherto sluggish level thereafter. Burley now has plenty to ponder before a World Cup qualifying campaign opens with an away double-header against Macedonia and Iceland early next month. Northern Ireland, who travel to Slovakia on September 6, will be the more content to have seen out scoreless parity even if, but for McGregor's interventions, they could have extended Scotland's friendly anguish in more definitive fashion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday August 26 2008. We said Sammy Clingan was the Northern Ireland player sent off after picking up two bookings in the international friendly played against Scotland on August 20. It was actually Ryan McGivern who was sent off and this has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Frozen food is a bit like Botox. Everybody, very close up, can tell that the freezing has occurred. Sometimes results are mixed, and you would have been better off chucking it out (the food, not your face), and other times the results are so good that it gives you new faith in the power of human ingenuity. </p> <p>I split my freezer food into five categories. First, me: there is nothing so disastrous that I won't eat it (I'm talking exclusively about freezing now, and no longer about Botox). Second, my offspring: I won't feed him anything that tastes bad, but I will feed him stuff that looks funny. Third, dinners \u00e0 deux: I wouldn't cook anything that looked funny for my beloved, but I will play fast and extremely loose with use-by dates and freezer duration. Fourth, my extended family: I would try not to give them food poisoning, but I will feed them things that look a bit compacted and sorry for themselves. And finally, fifth, there are some frozen foods that actively cry out for the honour of being served at a dinner party.</p> <p>The more structured a vegetable, the worse it will fare in the freezer. When its water content becomes ice, those cells expand, so obviously when they revert to being water, they collapse. Complicated-looking things such as cauliflower go particularly fuzzy round the edges. But I don't care. I will eat it. I will also eat lettuce, even though it both collapses and discolours, and stilton, even though cheese aficionados would probably spit at me in the street. I don't care if it doesn't taste its very best. It tastes better than it would taste sitting at the bottom of the bin, without me eating it. </p> <p>A lot of fruit and vegetables look dispiriting straight from the freezer, but taste good and, in some cases, approximate in their defrosted state what you'd normally do to them anyway, so they're fine for children. Pellets of spinach are great. Bananas self-mash on their way back to room temperature, in so far as they retain the characteristic banana shape, but are soggy all the way through. Brilliant for babies. If only a baby could understand how helpful that was!</p> <p>All mashed vegetables freeze well because they have already collapsed, so cottage, fish and shepherd's pies are good for midweek dinners, especially if you do them individually (that way they look all gastropub). Likewise, fishcakes, fritters and such. Freezing is a good way to save mashed portions of huge root veg such as celeriac. Peas and sweetcorn freeze extremely well. If you want to try something a little more exotic, edamame beans freeze well, and are delicious and much more fancy than simple peas. Baby whole sweetcorn, likewise, is more eventful than regular sweetcorn. In terms of frozen fruit, I would recommend raspberries (which, in terms of freezer durability, are the pea of the fruit world) and that smoothie mix that many supermarkets sell, although what manner of person has a smoothie for dinner? </p> <p>When cooking for extended family, I often use frozen fish fillets. Sure, you might get a tastier bit of fish fresh off a van that has come straight from the coast, but your standard fresh fish in a shop is no more delicious and much more expensive than the frozen variety. The only reason I wouldn't dinner-party on fillets is that they do always flatten a bit, and they are often trimmed in a factory-style to make them all the same size, and that, people, does not spell: \"I put a lot of thought into this because you're my esteemed friends.\" I never buy fresh prawns: I think you pay an idiot's premium for assuming they're going to be better than frozen ones.</p> <p>I have two other general tips. Assuming that you already know not to freeze whole eggs (the yolks go funny), egg whites are wonderful for the freezer because they don't take up much space. Egg-white omelettes are brilliant. Honestly. I'm not just saying that to sound like Julia Roberts. However, meringue-ed egg whites don't freeze at all. That is, you can put them in the freezer, but they won't change format. They won't even get cold. It's weird, but quite handy, if you want to serve a meringue-containing dessert but don't want to have to remember to get it out of the freezer in time. </p> <p>Finally, something Delia told me about duck and other fatty meats (in one of her books. She doesn't phone me up or anything. Oh, imagine): fat doesn't freeze. It might get very very cold, but whatever happens to it doesn't preserve it. So, very fatty meats - and we're really talking water fowl, even lamb isn't fatty enough to qualify - will stay frozen beneath their fatty exterior, but could well have gone rancid on the surface by the time you eat them. This, incidentally, is why game is given such a long freezer life by vendors, often up to a year. It has little fat on it, because it spent so much of its short life running away.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Vegetables</strong></p> <p>Most vegetables will freeze well if blanched or cooked. Petits pois you buy from supermarkets, which are one of the best frozen foods you can get, will have been picked and dunked into salted, boiling water first. Raw tomatoes would turn to mush. </p> <p><strong>Onion</strong></p> <p>Freezing raw onion will ruin the texture but if you chop too much, it's worth frying them up then freezing them as onions are the base of so many dishes. Or you could use raw frozen onions, and any left over little bits of veg - carrots, celery - for stock.</p> <p><strong>Fruit</strong></p> <p>Only really good if it's going to be cooked, pureed or made into jam.</p> <p><strong>Ginger</strong></p> <p>Buy a big root of it, freeze it whole and break off whatever you need straight from the freezer, and you'll be able to slice it more easily.</p> <p><strong>Herbs</strong></p> <p>You can use hard herbs like thyme, rosemary and bay straight from the freezer. Soft herbs like basil go a bit tragic-looking but you can crumble them, which is handy. </p> <p><strong>Meat</strong></p> <p>Any meat freezes well while fresh. After a few months, though, it will get a bit of taint from having been in the freezer too long, or \"freezer burn\", which drys it out. Freezing meat and fish for too long won't affect your health but it won't be as pleasurable to eat. Recommended freezing times, like use-by dates, are a bit nanny really.</p> <p>Generally, frozen meat is better in a prepared dish such as a stew, or if you buy it fresh and freeze it yourself. People who produce quality meat aren't into the freezing market. </p> <p>Freezing changes fat so you'll never be able to get crackling, for example, crispy when you cook the meat after defrosting because it will have too much water in it. </p> <p>If you roast a chicken and don't have time to make stock, freeze the bones to make stock later.</p> <p><strong>Dairy products</strong></p> <p>Defrosted milk would be OK to put in a white sauce, but if you put it in your cup of tea it would be lumpy (because of the fat changing consistency). Same with double cream. Strangely butter freezes really well, and is a good thing to have as it goes off so quickly. You can use it straight from the freezer for cooking. Parmesan you can grate straight from the freezer. White sauces and custard can be frozen in ice cube trays or little pots. </p> <p><strong>Fish</strong></p> <p>Many of the recipes in our book involve frozen fish. You can put it straight into something like a cassoulet. A miso soup with salmon in it is great. </p> <p><strong>Pulses</strong></p> <p>I wouldn't freeze pasta but cooked rice and pulses do well. In Italy you can buy frozen borlotti and flagelot beans everywhere. You don't have to soak them and they're way better than tinned. Soak and cook too many so you can always freeze a batch for another dish.</p> <p><strong>Bread</strong></p> <p>Sliced bread for toast is perfect freezer food.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Kitchen Revolution by Rosie Sykes, Polly Russell and Zoe Heron is published by Ebury Press, \u00a325</p>",
  "<p>This time he remembered to do his shoelaces up. This time he ran hard all the way to the finish, looking neither to right nor left, and left out the extravagant look-at-me gestures. And this time he beat the most intimidating record in men's sprinting, one that those who were in Atlanta on an August night 12 years ago thought might stand for a lifetime.</p> <p>Perhaps Usain Bolt had taken the criticisms to heart. Or perhaps, when he arrived in Beijing for the Games that will forever define his career, he was taking Michael Johnson's great 200m record more seriously than he needed to take his first target, his own 100m mark, set three months ago.</p> <p>When he ran 9.72sec back in May, bettering Justin Gatlin's record by two hundredths of a second, he must have known that, on the right night and in the right conditions, he could go much faster. What happened in the Bird's Nest on Saturday night would have come as no surprise to him.</p> <p>Confronting Johnson's epic achievement was another matter, however. The 200m is his distance, the one at which, aged 15, he became the youngest ever world junior champion. Earlier this year he managed to talk his coach, Glen Mills, into letting him run the 100m because he fancied it, but Mills has always thought that he is built for the longer distance - and even for the 400m, if only he were willing to do the work and endure the pain it would entail.</p> <p>Considering that he has still to run the 100m a dozen times in competition, which makes him hardly even a novice, the results have been pretty respectable. The way in which he ran 9.69 the other night has made a record that traditionally comes down in hundredths look like a soft target. For him, at least. But when Johnson, on that electrifying Georgia night in 1996, settled into his unique shoulders-back style and persuaded his legs to whirr to a record of 19.32 for the 200m, a mark was established that might as well have been sealed in a lead casket and buried in an unmarked tomb.</p> <p>Everyone knew Johnson was good, but amazement was the only possible reaction to an achievement that represented as much of a paradigm shift as Bob Beamon's 8.90m leap in Mexico City in 1968. Forget the late Florence Griffith-Joyner and her tainted 100m and 200m records, which have stained the record books for the past 20 years and may last another 20. The fact that no one ever found it necessary to cast aspersions on what Johnson did is what made Bolt's mission last night a matter of such high seriousness.</p> <p>Yes, he did a little dancehall steppin' in his lane before stripping off his tracksuit, and he repeated the now-famous archery mime before pointing again at the word \"Jamaica\" on his chest. But once he was down in the starting blocks, the concentration was total.</p> <p>In his first appearances on the international scene it was often said that, at 6ft 5in, he had trouble with his starts because he needed to arrange his gangling limbs before hitting anything like a smooth stride. That has been emphatically disproved in Beijing, where his getaways have been things of near-perfection. At 0.182sec his reaction time last night was only the fifth fastest of the eight finalists, but within three or four strides he had begun to rip past the men on either side of him. When he came out of the bend, the contest was already over.</p> <p>Once again he moved majestically into the distance, leaving the rest looking as though they were in a separate race. And now, inevitably, came the moment that had been so eagerly anticipated when we would see whether or not he intended make Saturday night's ebullient but premature celebrations a permanent feature of his performances.</p> <p>The truth of it was there to be seen in the last dozen strides. Once more there was clear water, five metres of it, between Bolt and his nearest pursuer. But this time everything spoke of effort ratcheted up to the maximum. There was a grimace on his face, his fists were bunched tight, and he even dipped in the textbook manner as he crossed the line, striving to squeeze out the last hundredth of a second. And, by two hundredths, the record was his, along with the gold medal.</p> <p>So now he becomes the ninth man in Olympic history to claim the 100m-200m double, following Archie Hahn (1904), Ralph Craig (1912), Percy Williams (1928), Eddie Tolan (1932), Jesse Owens (1936), Bobby Morrow (1956), Valeri Borzov (1972) and Carl Lewis (1984): six Americans, one Canadian, one citizen of the Soviet Union - and, now, a Jamaican. None of his predecessors, however, broke both world records in the process, and those times of 9.69 and 19.30 are the unassailable facts supporting the argument of anyone wishing to acclaim Usain Bolt, who turns 22 today, as the greatest sprinter of all time.</p> <p>He will need to be around for a while longer, adding to his collection of medals and records, before the award of such a status is universally recognised. Over the past four days, however, under the world's gaze on the biggest stage available to any athlete, he has made his case.</p> <p>Perhaps it is too much to hope that he has also banished the suspicions that have undermined the integrity of Olympic sprinting for so long. But when you look at him, at his 6ft 5in, 13st 8lb frame and at the articulation of his limbs as he devours the track, you might be forgiven for believing that he, more than any leading sprinter for several generations, might just be able to achieve such feats without artificial assistance. There is none of the sense of physical distortion created by the excess muscle that powered recent generations out of the blocks. He looks balanced and natural. Well, we can hope.</p>",
  "<p><br>The three vital ingredients of an arthouse film: a child, a pylon, and silence. Photos: AFP/Getty/Peter Parks / Guardian/Christopher Thomond / Guardian/Sarah Lee</p> <p>Hi there! Just back from the <a href=\"http://pardo.ch/jahia/Jahia/site/pardosite/lang/it/pid/1\">Festival del Film Locarno 2008</a>. Expect you're eager to know if I spotted any of those little unsung gems which your local multiplex would never show because your philistine neighbours are too brutish to appreciate them.</p> <p>Sure did. Look out for <a href=\"http://www.movieplayer.it/film/20586/yuri-s-day/extra/\">Yuri's Day</a>, a masterly treatment of the Moscow glitterati's hankering for the Russian soul that they've left behind in their country's primitive, frozen backwoods. Directed by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1970598/\">Kirill Serebrennikov</a>, a delightfully black-goateed caricature of the festival auteur, it may well be on its way to a fairly small screen, quite a long way from where you live, rather a long time from now.</p> <p>However, it wasn't such forlorn masterpieces that imprinted themselves on my consciousness. Rather, it was the more numerous specimens of Euro-arthouse endeavour that were grotesquely, unbelievably bad. No, actually a good bit worse than that. In some of these proud festival entries, not the faintest prospect of entertainment, stimulation or enlightenment was to be discerned.</p> <p>How could these abominations ever have got past their creator's first two seconds of deliberation, let alone won funding from a regional film board, a festival invitation and respectful applause from an audience of supposed cinephiles? </p> <p>Well, it seems that, when it comes to appalling subsidised cinema, there are certain qualifications that help. Being in black-and-white scores a good few points. A really brilliant director might even manage to switch from b/w for the tragic bits into glorious colour for the redemptive, ecstatic bits. Exposure of the dark horror of life on the social housing estates lurking behind the bright facade of Europrosperity seems a sure-fire ticket to success, especially if accompanied by plenty of under-exposed footage of the grim landscapes of the urban edgelands, preferably featuring lots of pylons.</p> <p>Kids are a useful feature of the starkly realistic approach, preferably subject to plenty of tastefully off-screen abuse. Since they're kids, of course, it doesn't matter if they can't act. And, in the arthouse world, they don't even have to be cute. Better if they're not, really. If you can't find kids, desperate women will do instead. Supposed humour, even of the lamest kind, will be greeted with wild cries of glee by your delighted audience.</p> <p>If you're going the mystic, philosophical route, a completely meaningless screenplay is good. Or, no dialogue at all. Let the silences carry the message. A spot of homage to a cinema master won't do any harm. Bergman may seem a bit obvious, but never mind. Bad language will make you seem fearfully brave.</p> <p>You perhaps recognise the kind of thing. But why does it reach the screen?</p> <p>Several possible explanations for my perplexity come to mind. One may already have occurred to you. It's that I'm too ignorant, insensitive and soulless to appreciate the profound merits of arthouse cinema. Up till now, I've been prepared to take this one seriously enough. However, Locarno 2008 has tested my humility to destruction. So let's consider some other possibilities.</p> <p>Decision-making in subsidised cinema is ultimately in the hands of bureaucrats and politically-appointed placemen. Perhaps, if film-makers and critics were in charge, quality would win through? Unfortunately, the admiring commendations offered to the creators of utter dross by all too many of such eminent personages puts paid to that one.</p> <p>Maybe you think arthouse film-makers are ruthless cynics out to win glory and a living by pulling the wool over the eyes of the gullible. But it is not so. Hear these guys talk, and whatever else about them may arouse your doubts, their sincerity shines through. Something deeper seems to be going on.</p> <p>It isn't, of course, only cinema that's beset nowadays by well-meaning garbage. It's much of the rest of the arts as well. In painting, sculpture, poetry, opera, you name it, idiots seem to have taken over much of the asylum. It all seems to have started a century or so ago, when high artists in many spheres began to go obscurantist. They took this course partly to prevent the beginning-to-rampage masses from accessing, and thereby polluting, their sacred field of endeavour. Ironically, they seem to have achieved exactly the opposite effect.</p> <p>The incomprehensible can't be evaluated by any except its authors and their fellow-initiates. Art has therefore become whatever they say it is. But in so becoming, it has also turned into whatever anyone else says it is. This has made artistic expression a huge Big Brother house, in which anyone who can find a sponsor can pronounce himself or herself an artist and perhaps secure fifteen minutes of adulation from would-be art-lovers adrift in a rudderless world. You can do a stream of consciousness? Become a James Joyce for our time.</p> <p>In the arcane world of subsidised cinema, this means that you can achieve lift-off with little more than the desire to express what, if anything, is in your heart. This can therefore have essentially the same character, and, apparently, quality, as the potato prints blutacked to fridge doors by the proud parents of five-year-olds. So go on, indulge yourself.</p> <p>What you really need is the capacity to ingratiate yourself with an incumbent artistic elite. If they'll recommend you to the Ruritanian Film Funding Board you're on your way. Especially if you're Ruritanian. Ruritania needs a glorious film industry, just as it needs a national airline. Excellence won't be a requirement in our now irredeemably relativist world. Indeed, its presence might affront the democratic principle, for everyone must now be as good as everyone else.</p> <p>Disbursers of public funds can therefore find space for other considerations. If your project can involve or celebrate whatever supposedly disenfranchised group constitutes the politically favoured of the month, your prospects will grow even brighter.</p> <p>Your work needn't have the capacity to engage serious numbers of your fellow human beings, as commercial cinema has to aspire to. It's better if it doesn't, or why should it be subsidised? Your fate will be in the hands of the self-perpetuating incumbent art-movie clique and its fawning bureaucratic and political paymasters. Certainly, none of those whose opinions need bother you will be complaining that the emperor is looking a trifle under-dressed.</p> <p>One of the few non-subsidised auteurs at Locarno was the American indie producer <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0882927/\">Christine Vachon</a>. She said that several film-makers from the subsidised world had told her they didn't think an audience important. She politely <a href=\"http://www.pardonews.ch\">remarked</a>: \"If there is not a continual dialogue between film-makers and their audience, the work becomes a little flaccid.\"</p> <p>This was the 61st Locarno film festival. Can't wait for the 62nd.</p>",
  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>How have our eating habits been affected by the credit crunch?</strong></p> <p>A better question might be: how haven't they been affected? Every day, reports of the latest victim of the credit crunch flood in to Nibbles HQ. The news that <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/food-and-drink/organic-food-becomes-latest-casualty-of-the-credit-crunch-13929923.html\">organic food</a> is in its death throes, as cash-strapped consumers cut back on 'ethical shopping', was one of the most widely trumpeted tales. Naysayers with longstanding anti-organic chips on their shoulders fell over themselves to read the last rites to pesticide-free produce. However, reading beyond the apocalyptic headlines, it appears that the Soil Association is still anticipating a 5% growth in the organic market this year. So, although that represents a slowdown on last year, the industry still looks pretty healthy.</p> <p>In other credit crunch-related food news, <a href=\"http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2008/08/20/322897/credit-crunch-hard-on-independent-restaurants-in-major.html\">independent restaurants</a> are struggling, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/07/23/cnaldi123.xml\">discount retailers</a> are thriving, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2008/aug/18/shrinkinggroceries\">packaged foods</a> are shrinking and, tragically, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2008/aug/14/leekshowhitbycreditcrunch\">giant vegetable contests</a> are being cancelled.

Seasonal greens are still affordable, and we all eat too much meat and dairy, so re-weighting our baskets in favour of the former will help our waistlines, wallets, <em>and</em> the planet. Nibbles spent a green and thrifty morning just this Saturday, biking to the farmers' market and stocking up on the basics, including plenty of cheap fruit and veg and a couple of tasty pig's cheeks.

In 2005, it was hailed as the cure to all known nutritional ills, but it has since been eclipsed by a whole host of other foods desperate for their day in the sun: pomegranates, acai berries, broccoli, brazil nuts, anything and everything containing omega three \u2026 </p> <p>Call us pass\u00e9, but we're still scoffing the fat, dusky berries like there's no tomorrow. The possible health benefits are a bonus, but it's the taste that keeps us going back for more - blueberries are more subtle and complex, less in-your-face, than other berries.</p> <p>There's a whole host of dishes you can make with blueberries - jams, muffins, pies and so on - but we've only discovered one recipe delicious enough to stop us simply eating them all straight from the punnet.

Ros\u00e9 is in danger of turning into Coca Cola - everyone's drinking it. But despite its uncool ubiquity, Nibbles can't resist. We were recently tempted into a branch of All Bar One - a venue not necessarily renowned for its extensive wine list - to sample the limited edition range of ros\u00e9s, chosen by <a href=\"http://www.bibendum-wine.co.uk/retail\">Bibendum</a>, the online wine retailer. My goodness me, we were impressed - surprised, yes, but definitely impressed. The wines on offer include a Sangiovese from Oregon, with a deliciously fruity, rich flavour; a lighter Pinotage from South Africa; and for those who like a bit of sparkle injected into their evenings (or lunchtimes), a crisp Prosecco from San Polo in northern Italy. Each of the wines is available by the glass as well as the bottle, so the curious can sample each one - though not on the same night, perhaps.<br><strong>Rachel Holmes</strong></p> <h2>OFFER OF THE WEEK</h2> <p>This week's credit crunch lunch comes courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.danddlondon.com/restaurants/almeida/home\">Almeida</a>, north London's favourite French neighbourhood restaurant.

  "<p>MI5 has concluded that there is no easy way to identify those who become involved in terrorism in Britain, according to a classified internal research document on radicalisation seen by the Guardian. </p> <p>The sophisticated analysis, based on hundreds of case studies by the security service, says there is no single pathway to violent extremism.</p> <p>It concludes that it is not possible to draw up a typical profile of the \"British terrorist\" as most are \"demographically unremarkable\" and simply reflect the communities in which they live. </p> <p>The \"restricted\" MI5 report takes apart many of the common stereotypes about those involved in British terrorism. </p> <p>They are mostly British nationals, not illegal immigrants and, far from being Islamist fundamentalists, most are religious novices. Nor, the analysis says, are they \"mad and bad\".<br> Those over 30 are just as likely to have a wife and children as to be loners with no ties, the research shows. </p> <p>The security service also plays down the importance of radical extremist clerics, saying their influence in radicalising British terrorists has moved into the background in recent years. </p> <p>The research, carried out by MI5's behavioural science unit, is based on in-depth case studies on \"several hundred individuals known to be involved in, or closely associated with, violent extremist activity\" ranging from fundraising to planning suicide bombings in Britain.</p> <p>The main findings include: </p> <p>\u0095 The majority are British nationals and the remainder, with a few exceptions, are here legally. Around half were born in the UK, with others migrating here later in life. Some of these fled traumatic experiences and oppressive regimes and claimed UK asylum, but more came to Britain to study or for family or economic reasons and became radicalised many years after arriving.</p> <p>\u0095 Far from being religious zealots, a large number of those involved in terrorism do not practise their faith regularly. Many lack religious literacy and could actually be regarded as religious novices. Very few have been brought up in strongly religious households, and there is a higher than average proportion of converts. Some are involved in drug-taking, drinking alcohol and visiting prostitutes. MI5 says there is evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation. </p> <p>\u0095 The \"mad and bad\" theory to explain why people turn to terrorism does not stand up, with no more evidence of mental illness or pathological personality traits found among British terrorists than is found in the general population.</p> <p>\u0095 British-based terrorists are as ethnically diverse as the UK Muslim population, with individuals from Pakistani, Middle Eastern and Caucasian backgrounds. MI5 says assumptions cannot be made about suspects based on skin colour, ethnic heritage or nationality. </p> <p>\u0095 Most UK terrorists are male, but women also play an important role. Sometimes they are aware of their husbands', brothers' or sons' activities, but do not object or try to stop them.</p> <p>\u0095 While the majority are in their early to mid-20s when they become radicalised, a small but not insignificant minority first become involved in violent extremism at over the age of 30.</p> <p>\u0095 Far from being lone individuals with no ties, the majority of those over 30 have steady relationships, and most have children. MI5 says this challenges the idea that terrorists are young men driven by sexual frustration and lured to \"martyrdom\" by the promise of beautiful virgins waiting for them in paradise. It is wrong to assume that someone with a wife and children is less likely to commit acts of terrorism.</p> <p>\u0095 Those involved in British terrorism are not unintelligent or gullible, and nor are they more likely to be well-educated; their educational achievement ranges from total lack of qualifications to degree-level education. However, they are almost all employed in low-grade jobs.</p> <p>The researchers conclude that the results of their work \"challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why\". </p> <p>Crucially, the research has revealed that those who become terrorists \"are a diverse collection of individuals, fitting no single demographic profile, nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism\".</p> <p>The security service believes the terrorist groups operating in Britain today are different in many important respects both from Islamist extremist activity in other parts of the world and from historical terrorist movements such as the IRA or the Red Army Faction.</p> <p>The \"UK restricted\" MI5 \"operational briefing note\", circulated within the security services in June, warns that, unless they understand the varied backgrounds of those drawn to terrorism in Britain, the security services will fail to counter their activities in the short term and fail to prevent violent radicalisation continuing in the long term.</p> <p>It also concludes that the research results have important lessons for the government's programme to tackle the spread of violent extremism, underlining the need for \"attractive alternatives\" to terrorist involvement but also warning that traditional law enforcement tactics could backfire if handled badly or used against people who are not seen as legitimate targets. </p> <p>The MI5 authors stress that the most pressing current threat is from Islamist extremist groups who justify the use of violence \"in defence of Islam\", but that there are also violent extremists involved in non-Islamist movements. </p> <p>They say that they are concerned with those who use violence or actively support the use of violence and not those who simply hold politically extreme views.</p>",
  "<p>From the moment a Catherine wheel of light spirals down to a dot illuminating the first dancer, this hour-long performance takes off into computer-generated space. Generating gyroscopic lines of light drawn to a soundtrack of scratchy, squelchy, squealing electronic tones, Mortal Engine creates a landscape of visual acrobatics occupied by half-a-dozen bodies of Chunky Move, the acclaimed Australian dance company.</p> <p>Light is an integral part of the choreography, particularly when the dancers, with an extraordinary full-body Etch-A-Sketch technique, \"paint\" light and shadow on to the sloped floor that acts as a video screen. When a group of five comes into view, their dusty aura makes them fascinatingly alien. Later, as one couple hint at the body language of being in bed, there is a suggestion that all of the above is a dream.</p> <p>But the undeniable \"wow\" factor masks the limitations of the production. As abstract narratives of relationships and environments are explored, it becomes apparent the dancers' roles are somewhat reduced amid the technical wizardry. Balling up in foetal position, they are insects, primordial creatures, who seem unable to stretch out into fully operational human form.</p> <p>When a green laser is turned on the audience and clouds of dry ice draw the company towards a \"heavenly\" end, there is little doubt that the \"dance\" in this dance company's latest show has been pushed to the background.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336789709\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The convicted paedophile Gary Glitter was refused entry to Hong Kong tonight after flying there from Thailand, the Foreign Office confirmed.</p> <p>Glitter had flown to the Chinese territory after refusing to board a flight to London following his deportation from Vietnam.</p> <p>The 64-year-old former glam rocker, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was deported after serving almost three years in jail for sexually abusing two girls.</p> <p>Chinese authorities informed their UK counterparts that they had barred Gadd from the country after his arrival at 11pm local time (1600 BST).</p> <p>He had refused to board a UK-bound flight at Bangkok airport, saying he was having a heart attack. </p> <p>Thai officials threatened to transfer him to a detention centre if he continued to thwart efforts to remove him from the airport but police and airline officials said Gadd had boarded a flight to Hong Kong this afternoon. </p> <p>Gadd's demands to be let into Thailand were refused by the Thai authorities, who were prepared to exercise powers to deny entry to convicted sex offenders and would not allow him to pass immigration.</p> <p>Travellers are allowed to spend only 12 hours in transit at the airport before they are deemed to have violated Thai immigration law. Gadd was told he would not be allowed to leave the airport unless it was on a flight out of the country.</p> <p>He missed his connection last night. A second flight left for London at 12.25pm local time (6.25am GMT), but Thai Airways said Gadd was not on board. </p> <p>Major General Phongdej Chaiprawat, of the Thai police, said: \"He is banned from entering (Thailand) because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality. He is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination.\"</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We were last aware that he remained in transit. He decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory.\"</p> <p>It is unlikely that any south Asian country will accept Gadd. Cambodia has already blacklisted him.</p> <p>Gadd's deportation degenerated into confusion yesterday when he landed in Bangkok after a 90-minute Thai Airways flight from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, but refused to transfer to his connecting flight.</p> <p>Gadd demanded to fly to Singapore after Thai officials refused to let him into the country.</p> <p>He argued with immigration officers, insisting he had \"done his time\" and was a \"free man\", while Thai officials and British embassy staff tried to persuade him to board the London-bound plane. Then he complained of a heart ailment and booked himself into a VIP hotel within the airport. The hotel is technically international territory. This morning Gadd refused to check out, claiming to be unwell.</p> <p>He was released yesterday from Thu Duc prison, north of Ho Chi Minh City, after serving two years and nine months of a three-year sentence for the repeated sexual abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.</p> <p>He had been due to arrive at Heathrow this morning, where he would have been met by police and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said today that Britain could not enforce Gadd's return. A British police officer sent to escort him back to the UK admitted he had no legal jurisdiction and could only look on during yesterday's developments.</p> <p>Gadd was jailed in the UK in 1999 for downloading child pornography. On release he moved to Spain and Cuba before going to south-east Asia.<br>Cambodia expelled him over alleged sex crimes and he went to the Vietnamese coastal resort of Vung Tau, where he lay low until his presence was uncovered in 2005 by British tabloid newspapers.</p> <p>The two girls he was eventually convicted of abusing initially said he had raped them \u2014 a crime which carries the death penalty \u2014 but were reportedly paid off. Gadd was arrested trying to leave Vietnam and stood trial. He pleaded not guilty, claiming he had been teaching the girls English. He was sentenced in March 2006.</p>",
  "<p>These are interesting times for Warner Bros. Mere days after the studio announced it was pushing back Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince from November to July 2009 arrives word of a pending spot of legal handbags with 20th Century Fox over the movie rights to Alan Moore's graphic novel Watchmen. The fanboys have been making shrill, excitable noises about a Hollywood adaptation of Moore's postmodern take on the superhero genre ever since the book came out in 1986, and after numerous false starts it seemed that Warner Bros was nearing the finishing line. The cast had been chosen, Zack \"300\" Snyder had been installed as director and principal photography was complete.</p> <p>All that remained between now and the March 6 2009 release date was a truckload of post-production and effects work. Hard work, to be sure; but perfectly doable. Now the release is in peril after it emerged that Fox, which was the first major studio to acquire feature rights to Watchmen back in the late 1980s, may still own the rights. Of course, Fox is going to have a mighty battle on its hands if it wants to yank this one from Warner Bros' kung fu grip, but conversely it may not be easy for Warner Bros to hold on.</p> <p>Last Friday a US federal judge threw out a motion by the studio to dismiss a suit filed by Fox back in February in which the latter asserted its right to adapt the property. Warner Bros claimed Fox gave up the rights following an absurdly complex series of agreements with producer Larry Gordon in 1991. Fox insisted it never relinquished the rights. Warner Bros' lawyers then claimed that the legal team at Fox wore ill-fitting jackets and trousers. The attorneys for Fox retorted that Warner Bros' lawyers used inferior plastic surgeons, which prompted a counter-claim from Warner Bros that their opponents sweated a lot, whereupon Fox\u2026</p> <p>OK the last bit isn't strictly true, but you get the point. Get two teams of lawyers together in a room and the argument can run for years, to the detriment of fans. Friday's ruling by US District Court Judge Gary Allen Feess means the studios will now start to prepare their cases for possible litigation. The latest word is that Fox wants to put the kibosh on the whole movie. Talk about throwing a spanner in the works. This whole matter begs the question, why did Fox wait so long to do this and why did they allow Warner Bros to get this far, including last month's presentation at the pop culture jamboree Comic-Con when the studio screened early footage and paraded Billy Crudup, Malin Akerman, Jackie Earle Haley and the rest of the key cast before thousands of gleeful geeks? Perhaps it's schadenfreude on Fox's part because the reaction to the footage last month nearly blew the roof off the San Diego Convention Centre.</p> <p>The whole issue could seriously disrupt Warners' early 2009 schedule (not to mention that of Paramount Pictures International, which holds international rights), as it would any studio. These days the tentpole release \u2013 that's to say the mega-blockbuster that annihilates every other movie in its path, generates sufficient revenue to power a third world country and makes grown men and women quake in their boots \u2013 is everything for the studios. They influence the balance sheets of corporate parents and determine the fate of executives and A-list stars \u2013 unless you're turkey-proof like Will Smith.</p> <p>Nothing matters more to a studio than to plant a flag in the middle of the calendar one, two even three years hence. As territory marking goes this falls just below military engagement in terms of scale and cost and Warner Bros subscribes to macho posturing as much as any of its rivals. The reason it shunted Harry Potter back by eight months was to ensure that it had a summer tentpole in place next year. The studio has already tentatively set its 2010 summer titan, which ironically enough is another Snyder film called Guardians of Ga-Hoole 3D. For Paramount it's Star Trek and GI Joe, while Sony has dated the Da Vinci Code prequel Angels and Demons, Disney is looking forward to Pixar's Up and Hannah Montana The Movie and Fox has Night at the Museum II and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Watchmen had been earmarked for the increasingly lucrative early spring slot. Now the question is not so much whether it will open as planned on March 6, but whether it will open at all.</p>",
  "<p>To the Taekwondo and that rarity - a British failure. Michael Harvey, however, emerged with credit from his first-round clash in the -58kg category when he lost only 3-2 to Guillermo Perez from Mexico. It was a spirited performance from the 18-year-old, who came back from 2-0 down, and said afterwards: \"It's tough. It was close. I thought I got him but I didn't.\" </p> <p>All was not lost for the British because the venue, the Beijing University of Science and Technology, might provide some inspiration for 2012. All fortnight the British have gone into a funk as to how they might match, let alone better, the majesty of this Games. They have reasons to be fearful for from opening to closing ceremony it is hard to see how things might be improved upon. </p> <p>The trick, therefore, may be to move the goalposts. After this most brutally modern of Games there is much to be said for a retreat into antiquity. There is no need to build the stunning stadia and skyscrapers the Chinese have constructed: the infrastructure exists already. </p> <p>Let us open the doors of Oxford and Cambridge and hold the fencing and the judo, the boxing and the taekwondo there. Instead of housing the athletes in an anodyne village open the doors of Queen's and King's and let them in. Let them live among the classical architecture. Dream their dreams among the spires. Let the chapels be filled with choirs singing Tallis and Purcell. The Chinese have held many events in their brutalist universities; let us use the beauties of our two greatest universities as a backdrop to ours. In an increasingly thoughtless present, why not ponder some of the glories of the past? After strength, why not beauty? </p> <p>Back at the Taekwondo - think fencing with legs for swords - it was the women's -49kg which produced most of the excitement. This sport - women kicking the shit out of each other - strikes me as tailor-made to be run by Max Mosley should he wish to combine business with pleasure on his retirement from formula one.</p> <p>Chief kicker was Wu Jingyu who to the delight of the home crowd raced into a 4-1 lead in her semi-final before closing it out with a knee-high tackle that wouldn't have looked out of place in the Chelsea v Leeds 1970 Cup final replay. </p> <p>In the other semi-final, Dalia Contreras Rivero of Venezuela took on Buttree Puedpong of Thailand in something of a classic as the Thai scored late in the third round to take the game into extra-time. This settled nothing and all came down to the decision of superiority from the judges. This, to the consternation of those watching in Caracas, went against the Venezuelan. Puedpong, therefore, won the privilege of having the shit kicked out of her by the World Champion. It duly happened in a contest which ended 1 to -1, and the Thai was lucky to get -1. The delight of Wu was great.</p> <p>The men's competition was more open chiefly thanks to Yulis Gabriel Mercedes who, having beaten the Olympic champion, faced up to the World champion in the semi-final. He was leading when, with seconds remaining, a point was deducted for, I think, hugging - a controversial decision which led to a spiky debate in the Olympic Family section between a Senegalese and pony-tailed Spaniard. </p> <p>Undaunted, Mercedes scored in extra time and the watching pony-tailed Spaniard shrugged his shoulders in defeat. The final, against Harvey's conqueror, also went to extra time and on to the decision of superiority. Mercedes seemed certain he had showed more initiative, the judges disagreed, their decision sparking off one of the most joyous sights in the world of sport, that of happy Mexicans.</p>",
  "<p>The formal process leading to Georgia's membership of Nato has begun, partly because of Russia's occupation, <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidmiliband\">David Miliband</a> said today.</p> <p>In an <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2008/aug/20/borger.miliband.georgia\">interview with the Guardian</a> in Tbilisi, the foreign secretary said <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/Georgia\">Georgia</a> had been given a \"route map to membership\" after the formation on Tuesday of a joint commission aimed at forging closer ties.</p> <p>He said the commission was an important step towards implementing a pledge made by Nato leaders at a summit in April.</p> <p>\"I think the formal process kicked off yesterday with the establishment of a Nato-Georgia commission, and we have taken seriously the commitments the heads of government made in April,\" Miliband said. \"It's an important signal but there is also important substance to it.\"</p> <p>Some European diplomats have depicted the joint commission as a sop to Georgia, predicting its membership will be put on hold because of the conflict with Russia that started on August 7.</p> <p>Miliband rejected that view, arguing the commission would have practical consequences. \"In practical terms, Nato is offering close cooperation with the Georgian government and the Georgian military. That means helping the Georgians build up their capacity.</p> <p>\"It means building up proper interoperability with Nato, proper joint training. It also means ensuring the structures of cooperation ... are properly geared towards eventual membership. So this is a route map to membership.\"</p> <p>But as Miliband set out the government's position, <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-658,00.html\">Nick Brown</a>, Labour's deputy chief whip, appeared to contradict him by publishing an article saying that allowing Georgia to join Nato would be a mistake.</p> <p>Brown, a key ally of the prime minister, used an article for Comment is Free to argue against it being admitted to the military alliance.</p> <p>The Labour powerbroker made his comments in an article attacking the Conservative leader, David Cameron, for urging Georgia's membership to be brought forward.</p> <p>\"Cameron urges Nato to admit Georgia. Nato is a mutual defence pact. This position will have gone down very well in Tbilisi, but do we really mean to commit ourselves to an all-out war against the Russian Federation if something like this happens again? I don't favour that approach and I don't know anyone who does,\" Brown wrote.</p> <p>The Foreign Office said that although it was opposed to Georgia joining Nato immediately, the comments in Nick Brown's article did not reflect the government's position.</p> <p>Tensions have grown between Russia and Nato as former Warsaw Pact members and ex-Soviet republics on Russia's borders have joined the alliance.</p> <p>On the diplomatic front, Nato foreign ministers yesterday suspended their formal contacts with Russia as punishment. The alliance's secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, said \"there can be no business as usual with Russia under present circumstances\".</p> <p>Milband rejected the argument that Nato's expansion into Georgia and Ukraine would dilute its principle of collective defence. Sceptics have said western countries would not be willing to go to war on Georgia's side against Russia.</p> <p>Miliband said the Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - had been made full members without devaluing the importance of membership. \"Ten years people were saying, how could these countries be members of Nato?</p> <p>\"They are independent countries. They are not ex-Soviet Union. They are independent sovereign countries with democratic governments who have every right to make their own decisions on the basis of their own popular will.</p> <p>\"I think it's right to see Georgian and Ukrainian membership as part of a process to build up these countries as a permanent fixture of the international landscape, not just as an accident.\"</p> <p>Miliband this morning visited a camp near Tbilisi for people displaced by the conflict and heard what he described as moving \"human testimony\" from people caught up in the conflict. </p> <p>The foreign secretary met Malkhaz Sadlobelasvili, 49, who said that he had fled from his village near the border with South Ossetia last week.</p> <p>\"We escaped on a tractor. We had no choice. The fighting had started,'\" said Sadlobelasvili, from Pkhvenisi, adding: \"My mother is still there. She was too old to flee.\"<br> Another refugee, Ani Berdznishvili, 50, said she escaped from her home in Gori when the Russians bombarded the town. \"A bomb came down. It exploded and I saw four people killed in front of me. The Russians are barbarians. We hid in the basement.</p> <p>\"This is our territory. I only intend to go back to my city when the last Russian solider has left.\"</p> <p>Miliband said there was strong evidence that \"random killings\" had taken place in Georgian villages around Gori. He called for \"independent bodies, not governments\" to carry out an investigation into claims that South Ossetian and other Russian militias had killed civilians.</p> <p>Some 128,000 Georgians had been internally displaced by the conflict, Georgian's minister for health, Sandro Kuitashvili, said this morning.</p> <p>Russia had pledged to begin its pullout from Georgia on Monday and yesterday a small Russian convoy was reported to have left Gori heading north. But elsewhere in Georgia, Russian troops appeared to be expanding their operations.</p> <p>Russian troops yesterday paraded around 20 blindfolded and bound Georgian prisoners on armoured vehicles. They had been taken from the Black Sea port of Poti to nearby Senaki, according to Poti's mayor, Vano Taginadze, who said he was told they would be released today.</p> <p>The men, said to be Georgian soldiers and police, were taken captive because Georgia refused to let Russian armoured vehicles into Poti, Tagidnadze said. Russian forces in Poti had blocked access to the city's naval and commercial ports.</p> <p>Washington made clear it expected Russia to move faster. \"It didn't take them really three or four days to get into Georgia, and it really shouldn't take them three or four days to get out,\" said Gordon Johndroe, the White House national security spokesman.</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, said Russia was not only flouting its withdrawal commitment but its forces were \"not losing time\" in damaging Georgia by destroying infrastructure.</p>",
  "<p>American hoaxers used a rubber gorilla suit frozen in a block of ice to pretend they had found the remains of Bigfoot, it was revealed today.</p> <p>Two men claimed last week that they had found the body of Bigfoot in the woods of Georgia.</p> <p>The 2.3m (7ft 7in) \"corpse\", encased in ice, was sold to Tom Biscardi, a Bigfoot tracker, for an undisclosed sum after he was shown a DNA sample purported to have been taken from the remains.</p> <p>Pictures were posted on the <a href=\"http://www.searchingforbigfoot.com\">Searching for Bigfoot</a> website.</p> <p>During the thawing process, Bigfoot experts noticed that part of the creature's head was \"unusually hollow\", and their suspicions were confirmed when the ice melted to reveal a rubber foot.</p> <p>In 2005, Biscardi claimed to have captured a male Bigfoot - but that also turned out to have been a hoax.</p> <p>News of the latest alleged find was revealed last week by Matt Whitton, a police officer, and Rick Dyer, a former prison officer, who claimed to have stumbled across Bigfoot's body while out hiking. </p> <p>The pair described the creature as weighing over 560lb (255kg), with huge feet like a person's and reddish hair.</p> <p>Bigfoot experts reacted with suspicion and the story soon began to unravel.</p> <p>Yesterday, Steve Kulls, the host of Squatch Radio, a US internet radio station dedicated to Bigfoot, revealed the deceit. \"On August 16, the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the Searching For Bigfoot team,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The ice was being thawed slowly, and the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed. I extracted some from the alleged corpse, examined it and had some concerns.\"</p> <p>The team decided to burn a sample, which - unlike hair, but like a synthetic material - melted into a ball. </p> <p>\"Within the next hour of thaw, a break appeared up near the feet area,\" Kulls said. </p> <p>\"As the team and I began examining this area near the feet, I observed the foot - which looked unnatural - reached in, and confirmed it was a rubber foot.</p> <p>\"Later that day, we were informed that Mr Whitton and Mr Dyer had admitted it was a costume.\"</p> <p>Telephone calls to Whitton and Dyer went unreturned, but the voicemail recording for their Bigfoot Tip Line had been updated to say that the duo were also looking for dinosaurs.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Hayden, the CIA director, claimed in May that al-Qaida had been essentially defeated in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and was on the defensive throughout most of the rest of the world.</p> <p>An exception is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/algeria\">Algeria</a>, where an offshoot of al-Qaida has stepped up the tempo of deadly attacks in the past few months.

The same tactics have wrought a terrible toll in Iraq. </p> <p>The latest atrocities follow a particularly deadly in month in July.

Even ambulances have been targets, and foreign workers in Algeria's important energy sector have been singled out.</p> <p>The wave of assaults will confirm fears in north African and the western world that the Maghreb is an increasingly dangerous front in the fight against extremists. </p> <p>Violence in the region has increased dramatically since 2006, when the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GPSC), Algeria's last big extremist group from a particularly vicious insurgency and counter-insurgency in the 1990s, renamed itself al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, and was welcomed as a new recruit by Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Laden's deputy.</p> <p>Many of the group's attacks have taken place in the Tizi Ouzou and Boumerdes districts. These were hotbeds of Islamist resistance during the 1990s Algerian civil war, which claimed an estimated 200,000 lives and gave rise to the ruthless Armed Islamic Group, of which the GSPC is an offshoot. </p> <p>The Berber areas of the Kabylia mountains were the scene of some of the worst fighting during the country's struggle against French colonial rule.</p> <p>For the west, the fear is that the terrorists see Europe as their ultimate target \u2013 Moroccan nationals were involved in the 2004 Madrid bombings <br>\u2013 although their immediate fight is with the pro-western governments of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. </p> <p>The attacks coincide with an ambitious attempt by the French president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolassarkozy\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, to create a Mediterranean union of 43 countries, including the EU, Israel and states from north Africa, the Balkans and the Arab world. </p> <p>Sarkozy wants the union to tackle issues such as regional unrest, immigration and pollution, although critics say the scheme lacks substance. </p> <p>It can be assumed that al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and its allies in north Africa see this vision for the Mediterranean as anathema to their goals of expunging western influence from the Maghreb.</p> <p>The wave of bombings in Algeria bears out reports that the al-Qaida \"brand\" is gaining strength in north Africa. The Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported last year on movable training camps in place in the scrub country of the Sahel, the thinly populated, semi-arid region that includes parts of southern Algeria, Mauritania, Mali and Niger. </p> <p>According to the paper, north African activists had been been recruiting Islamist fighters in Spain and sending them to the Sahel for training, raising the prospect of more attacks on European soil.</p> <p>Faced with the growing terrorist threat in north Africa, the US has created the 10-country Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership and allocated $80m (\u00a341m) for arms, training and intelligence sharing. </p> <p>The American General William Ward told military chiefs in Senegal last year they shared a \"common goal of reducing the ability of violent extremists to harm or kill innocent civilians\". </p> <p>US officials say they do not want north Africa to become another Afghanistan. The risk is that heavy-handed counter-insurgency tactics will backfire, fuel popular resentment and alienate the populace from western-backed governments in the region.</p>",

  "<p>The disgraced former glam rocker Gary Glitter could find himself behind bars again after refusing to board a flight to London following his deportation from Vietnam after serving a jail sentence for sexually abusing children. </p> <p>The 64-year-old, whose real name is Paul Gadd, today remained in the transit lounge of Bangkok airport, where he had been due to change planes, but will be transferred to a detention centre if he continues to thwart efforts to send him back to the UK. </p> <p>\"Officials concerned are working through the process of putting him on the plane to take him out of the country, but if he continues to refuse to leave then he will be confined in the [airport transit] area temporarily before being taken into a detention centre,\" said Lieutenant General Chatchawal Suksomchit, the chief of Thailand's immigration police. </p> <p>His demands to be let into Thailand were refused by the Thai authorities, who are exercising powers to deny entry to convicted sex offenders and will not allow him past immigration. </p> <p>Travellers are allowed to spend only 12 hours in transit at the airport before they are deemed to have violated Thai immigration law. Gadd has been told he will not be allowed to leave the airport unless it is on a flight out of the country. </p> <p>He missed his connection last night, and a second flight left for London at 12.25pm local time, but Thai Airways said Gadd was not on board. It is unclear whether police will use force to put him on a plane. </p> <p>Major General Phongdej Chaiprawat, of the Thai police, said: \"He is banned from entering (Thailand) because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality. He is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination.\" </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We were last aware that he remained in transit. He decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory.\"</p> <p>It is unlikely that any south Asian country will accept Gadd. Cambodia has already blacklisted him.</p> <p>Gadd's deportation degenerated into confusion yesterday when he landed in Bangkok after a 90-minute Thai Airways flight from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, but refused to transfer to his connecting flight. </p> <p>Gadd demanded to fly to Singapore after Thai officials refused to let him into the country. </p> <p>He argued with immigration officers, insisting he had \"done his time\" and was a \"free man\", while Thai officials and British embassy staff tried to persuade him to board the London-bound plane. Then he complained of a heart ailment and booked himself into a VIP hotel within the airport. The hotel is technically international territory. This morning Gadd was refusing to check out, claiming to be unwell. </p> <p>He was released yesterday from Thu Duc prison, north of Ho Chi Minh City, after serving two years and nine months of a three-year sentence for the repeated sexual abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11. </p> <p>He had been due to arrive at Heathrow this morning, where he would have been met by police and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said today that Britain could not enforce Gadd's return. A British police officer sent to escort him back to the UK admitted he had no legal jurisdiction and could only look on during yesterday's developments. </p> <p>Gadd was jailed in the UK in 1999 for downloading child pornography. On release he moved to Spain and Cuba before going to south-east Asia. </p> <p>Cambodia expelled him over alleged sex crimes and he went to the Vietnamese coastal resort of Vung Tau, where he lay low until his presence was uncovered in 2005 by British tabloid newspapers. </p> <p>The two girls he was eventually convicted of abusing initially said he had raped them \u2014 a crime which carries the death penalty \u2014 but were reportedly paid off. Gadd was arrested trying to leave Vietnam and stood trial. He pleaded not guilty, claiming he had been teaching the girls English. He was sentenced in March 2006.</p>",
  "<p>Is your office unbearably quiet? Is tumbleweed drifting between the desks, the canteen suddenly deserted and the phones strangely silent? Once again this year I have asked myself why I choose to work in August when everyone else is out playing. I feel like a naughty school child kept in while the rest of the class gets ice-cream and a trip to the zoo.<br><br>As a self-employed freelancer I take the view that when everyone else is out of town, I shouldn't be. So I'm here, poised, waiting to fill all those lovely gaps caused by selfish staffers who want holidays when their kids are off. But it's tough going. Nearly everyone you need to reach is ... on holiday. August is a whole month of Friday afternoons when part of your brain refuses to engage and scolds you for swimming against the tide instead of in a pool or the sea like everyone else. </p> <p>It's not just my brain that's signed an annual leave form - I swear my computer keys are half asleep and every application I need to use takes twice as long. It seems that the hamsters running the internet are working to a skeleton staff in August, just like everyone else.</p> <p>So what's the solution? Join everyone else in a massive traffic jam or overcrowded airport? How about hitting the trains? I bet they're nice and packed too. Or you could pay three times as much for a break as you would at any other time of year, just for the privilege of not being stuck behind your desk while we're having such a lovely summer. </p> <p>There really is nothing quite so difficult for humans to bear as the feeling of missing out. Sure, you can look forward to your cheap late-season break when everyone else is back at work, maybe even allowing yourself a secret sense of smugness for still having your holiday to come while they can only look back on theirs.</p> <p>But I still dream of one day taking August off - it keeps me going while beach-boasting postcards drop through the letterbox.</p> <p>If you're stuck at work, how do you cope with the tumbleweed, treacle brain, motivational problems and deafening silence? Or is it just a case of grin and bear it?</p>",
  "<p>With Christine Ohuruogu overturning a lifetime Olympic ban to win gold in Beijing and John Terry recovering from his Moscow penalty miss to win the England captaincy, it seems that today's papers are filled with heart-warming redemption.</p> <p>Take <strong>Mika\u00ebl Silvestre</strong>, for instance. It appears that the out-of-favour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/20/arsenal.manchesterunited\">Manchester United defender is bound for Arsenal</a> in one of the most bizarre swoops seen since Vanilla Ice made a girl fall off a horse by jumping at her <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z1xqLPcE0c&amp;feature=related\">with his motorbike</a>. Roy Keane had been hoping to re-unite with his former team-mate, but will instead make do with signing <strong>David Healy</strong> from Fulham and <strong>Anton Ferdinand</strong> from West Ham.</p> <p>Such a daring move, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's that is, not Ice's, will almost certainly please Gunners fans, as Le Professeur has been insisting for the last few weeks that he has only been looking for a midfielder, despite all the evidence pointing a glaring need to plug the gaping hole in the Arsenal's dodgy defence. Like Ohuruogu and Terry before him, Silvestre, has thus been afforded another truly moving shot at the big time.</p> <p>And moving shots remind the Mill of two things. Deco's goal for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/18/premierleague1\">Chelsea on Sunday</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TjyR_3mUsM\">last scene</a> of the Shawshank Redemption, when Morgan Freeman's character meets up with that of Tim Robbins's on the sun-soaked sands of Zihuatanejo, Mexico. Freeman was nominated for an Oscar in that film and Tony Mowbray is looking to land one of his own by beating Newcastle to 20-year-old Argentinian forward <strong>Oscar Trejo</strong> of Real Mallorca. Mowbray has already returned from the Spanish holiday island with a nice sun-tan, a bottle of Sangria, a \u00a34.9m hole in his pocket and <strong>23-year-old midfielder Borja Valero</strong>.</p> <p>Spain, then, is clearly not a popular destination for footballers this week as Paul Ince is hoping to persuade Jordi L\u00f3pez to leave Mallorca for the tropical climes of Lancashire, while <strong>Tottenham plan to replace the outgoing Dimitar Berbatov with Diego Forlan of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</strong>. Once Berba's off, <strong>Hull reckon they can bring Fraizer Campbell back from United for \u00a35m</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Espanyol's Albert Riera</strong>, meanwhile, could be latest addition to Liverpool's expanding Spanish community as Rafa Ben\u00edtez concedes defeat in his bid to sign Gareth Barry, although word has it that <strong>Stewart Downing</strong> is having Spanish lessons ahead of a possible move to Anfield.</p> <p>Elsewhere, West Ham have gone to extreme lengths to boost their firepower by deciding to buy a tank. Chilean forward <strong>Sebastian Pinto</strong> is thus nicknamed and poised to join Upton Park on a season-long deal, and in what could be yet another emotional sporting return to greatness (or not) La Gazzetta Dello Sport reports that Milan have agreed a deal to take <strong>Andriy Shevchenko</strong> back to the San Siro on loan from Chelsea \u2013 a sweetener which has nothing whatsoever to do with Chelsea's sustained attempt to land the \u00a370m-rated Kak\u00e1.</p>",
  "<p>On a dry salt lake deep in the remote west Australian outback, a British engineer is preparing for the ride of his life \u2013 powered by nothing but the wind. </p> <p>Richard Jenkins hopes the perfect gust will blow his high-tech buggy to 120mph and into the record books. If he succeeds, it will mark the end of a decade-long quest for the wind-powered landspeed record. It would also convince him that a greater goal is within reach: by swapping the wheels on his craft for ice skates, and windswept Australia for the frozen wilderness of North America, Jenkins wants to go faster still, and become the swiftest naturally propelled human on the planet.</p> <p>Jenkins is currently making final preparations for the landspeed record bid at Lake Lefroy, 300 miles from Perth. Heavy rain has delayed the effort, but a suitable window of dry and windy weather is expected to open within days.</p> <p>His craft borrows technology from Formula One racing cars and has more in common with an airplane than a sailing ship. While conventional land yachts have a flexible sail, this vehicle has a rigid vertical wing, which generates thrust in the same way as a conventional aircraft wing produces lift. Combined with its streamlined shape, this allows the craft to travel at up to six times the speed of the wind.</p> <p>Jenkins said: \"Top speed is actually quite scary. The structure and tyre grip is all at the limit, so keeping it in a straight line under full control takes full concentration.\" </p> <p>Trials in 2007 had to be aborted because of difficulty harnessing the immense power generated in even light winds. On a Nevada salt lake in 2005, Jenkins lost control at 106mph. \"The winds out there are much more unpredictable, and in search of the perfect gust, I sailed into a pretty violent wind and dust storm. I lost steerage and span for about a quarter mile. Stopped when I hit the scrub on the edge of the lake.\" To achieve the high speeds, the craft does not travel straight downwind but at an angle.</p> <p>The existing record of 116.7mph was set in 1999 by the American Bob Schumacher in his \"Iron Duck\" craft. Jenkins says he has already beaten that twice, in practice runs on the 3000m tarmac runway at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. His claimed speed of more than 120mph remains unofficial because there were no independent observers. In 2002, Jenkins officially clocked 113mph there, enough to set a new British record. The world record needs to be set on a natural surface, which rules out the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336776020\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/8/19/1219141923913/RichardJenkins.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Jenkins\" width=\"220\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Jenkins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said: \"I have tried every year, with different vehicles in different continents, but it is a tough challenge. The previous record holders spent five years on standby, waiting for the perfect day, and they live there, in the desert. If you have to travel overseas, assemble a team, the vehicle, official observers and a film crew, for ratification purposes as required by the Americans, and the perfect wind, it takes many attempts.\"</p> <p>This month's attempt will see Jenkins race the fifth version of his wind-driven vehicle, which was originally called Windjet, but has now been renamed <a href=\"http://www.greenbird.co.uk/\">Greenbird</a>, as a nod to Donald Campbell's Bluebird, under a sponsorship deal with UK renewable energy firm Ecotricity. A second seat has been fitted, to allow Dale Vince, Ecotricity's managing director, along for the ride.</p> <p>Vince said: \"Campbell made his record attempts in what historians will look back on as the golden age of fossil fuels. Fast forward 80 years and we are coming to the end of the age of fossil fuels and the dawn of the age of renewables. The Greenbird symbolises this historical watershed.\" Ecotricity says it will incorporate some of the craft's design into its wind turbines.</p> <p>The weather at Lake Lefroy is expected to allow record attempts until the middle of next month. On a good day, the team could make up to 40 runs, covering more than 200 miles.</p> <p>Because the craft is optimised for top speeds, it is relatively slow off the mark and can take 40 seconds to reach 50mph, more than twice as slow as a Robin Reliant. Acceleration beyond that point is more rapid, and it can reach 100mph in just another 10 seconds.</p> <p>From September, the team's attention will switch to running the craft on ice. Despite wild pre-war claims for speeds as high as 140mph, the generally agreed record for an ice yacht is 80mph.</p> <p>Jenkins says, in theory, ice should be a lot faster than land, and that 150mph is a reasonable target. \"But my experience on land tells me it is all much harder than you think. It is not out of the question that there may be a fundamental reason why it is impossible to travel fast on ice due to the skate-ice interaction at high loads and speeds.\"</p> <p>A speed of 150mph would be tantalisingly close to the ultimate speed record for an Earth-bound non-motorised human, which was set at 156mph by the Italian speed skier Simone Origone in 2006. Free from the surly bonds of Earth, the Austrian speed skydiver Alexander Diem reached an eyewatering 313mph during a jump in 2007.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>2.05am:</strong> Morning. Well, Team GB have had a fine Olympics thus far. To ease you into the early hours I'll let you relive the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/christineohuruogu.olympicsathletics\">success of Christine Ohuruogu, who arrived later than a Virgin train</a> on the West Coast Mainline to snatch gold in the 400m. </p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>There was also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/chrishoy.olympicscycling\">Chris Hoy's small matter of making Olympic history</a> by winning three gold medals in cycling; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/beijingcycling\">Victoria Pendleton's sprint to her second gold medal</a>.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.paulgoodison\">Paul Goodison's leisurely sail to gold medal success in the Laser class</a>.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>In the meantime I'll get you all the information you need to guide you through the morning.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.10am:</strong> There are Brits in action already people. The inaugural women's 10k open-water swim is underway and Team GB's Cassie Patten and Keri-Anne Payne have medal aspirations. After the first 500m Payne is out at the front. But don't go expecting a medal yet as there's a lot of clear water left in this one. Payne obviously can't see where she's going, as she bounces off a bouy at the 13-minute mark.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.20am:</strong> This is very much the New Olympic Sport Morning. BMX action has just bunny-hopped into life on a dusty track somewhere in China. It's pretty exciting stuff, if I'm being honest. The BMX-er (is that what they're called?) flies down a hill and then jumps over a dozen or so humps - bobbing up and down like a grasshopper - and finally flirts over the finish line. It's all over pretty quickly, but it's fun while it lasts. Britain's Liam Phillips and Shanaze will be competing at some point. I'll keep you updated.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.25am:</strong> British pair Cassie Paten and Keri-Anne Payne are leading the 10k open-water race... but hold your horses Team GB fans, as third-placed Russian Larisa Ilchenko has never lost an open-water race, so how's that for having your chips dampened?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.30am:</strong> Wow! The BMX-ing is the BEST thing ever. An Australian called Kamakazi has just hopped his way around the track. Apparently he changed his name by deed poll because he's such a <em>crazy</em> guy.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.35am:</strong> Liam Phillips was so quick for Britain 37.392sec that I missed him. But he wasn't fast enough to gain the lead in the time-trial. I'll update you as to his place when somebody in Beijing can work out what's going on amid the din of an American PA and French electro duo MGMT.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.40am:</strong> A pleasant email from an antipodean: \"Without wanting to get ahead of myself, let me be the first Aussie to congratulate you Brits on finishing ahead of us on the medal tally. It's been a super effort.\" Thanks William Sinclair. \"But I'm hugely proud of the Australian athletes who have, as usual, punched miles above their weight and, to a man and woman, conducted themselves brilliantly. The fact we'll finish behind our brothers and sisters in Britain for the first time in 20 years is unfortunate, but I can guarantee you that, like a losing Ashes team, we'll be using this to come back stronger than ever!\" I can almost hear the collective sacking of sports coaches in Melbourne William. Meanwhile in the land of men's beach volleyball the US are one set up against Georgia in the semi-final. It's like watching <a href=\"http://www.audioshocker.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/maverick07.jpg\">that homo-erotic scene from Top Gun</a>.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.45am:</strong> All the BMX competitors have kept their helmets on so it's my reckoning that they're all 44-year old former skate-punks. BMX-ing was huge around the time of ET you see. On the subject of the BMX-ing: \"Is it me or is the course not challenging enough?\" asks Michael Lee. \"Seventeen riders gone so far and no wipe-outs. It is only a 36 second-long course, and all riders are separated by just a 0.9 second gap. Maybe a couple of 30 metre-jumps should be included. Over crocodile-infested water. That would make things more exciting. Are there any other suggestions how we could liven this event up?\" You're a hard man to please Michael. What about scattering tacks and oil on the rack? Perhaps even a few banana skins. failing that give them fixed-wheel bikes.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.55am:</strong> GB's Cassie Patten and Keri-Anne Payne are still leading the 10k open-water race. They're taking on water as they go. They have to grab it out of nets and then somehow drink it. THEY'RE SWIMMING IN A RESERVOIR! All they have to do is duck and swallow and they'd save seconds on the water pick-up. Jeez! Liam Phillips has finished 25th out of 30-odd BMX riders. He'll have another round to increase his position and then he'll race-off against a competitor in a seeded competition. So basically, he needs to hop round that track a damn sight faster if he expects to get a reasonable draw.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3am:</strong> The women have just set off in the first seeding run in the BMX race. The British competitor is called Shanaze Reade. She's the world champion in the event, and more impressively, she's from Crewe! Now I've got nothing against Crewe but it's not the first place I think of when I hear the words BMX. It's got an impressive <a href=\"http://cache.viewimages.com/xc/73433866.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=17A4AD9FDB9CF1930F65A344AAC8D0702100197CECAB3D92284831B75F48EF45\">Grand Junction</a> though.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.05am:</strong> I have just cursed Shanaze Reade. The poor girl takes a terrible tumble at the first corner and appears to have gashed her elbow and left leg. She manages to get back on and limp to the finish line, but now, everything is riding on her second run if she's to get a decent seeding.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.10am:</strong> That was a great shame for Shanaze Reade. Although, it was good to see her looking angry rather than crestfallen when she finished. There were no Radcliffe-like tears despite the crushing disappointment of eating dust. A pedant writes: \"You would have thought that if Mr Kamakazi was going to go to all the trouble of changing his name that he would at least have spelled kamikaze correctly. Maybe it's like getting an Equity card; there can't be two people with the same name and there is another BMXer with that name already,\" says Pommie Barsteward, who I presume changed his name by deed poll. I've not got an issue with the spelling Pommie Barsteward, but surely if they were true Kamakazes they wouldn't exist after the first round.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.15am:</strong> Beleaguered Georgia just can't get assistance from the US. They've just been beaten in straight sets 2-0 in the men's beach volleyball semi-final. In the other semi-final Brazil are taking on Brazil. Yesterday we had a similar situation in the women's competition in which two Chinese teams competed against each other. This seems a bit odd to me. I'd have thought each country should only be able to enter one team each. Perhaps it's because there are not enough countries who are decent at beach volleyball out there.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> The British pair of Cassie Patten and Keri-Anne Payne appear to be using tactics to prevent the imperious Russian Larisa Ilchenko from getting past them. It's not a bad idea because as it stands the Russian will have to swim sideways to get around them. There is the possibility of one of Ilchenko just getting rough and barging her way through though. Which could be her only option. The swimmers have all just taken on water again. It's a bit of a farce to be honest though, as they hardly get a gulp down them. It's due to finish in 35 minutes so stay tuned folks.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.25am:</strong> Liam Phillips has just made his second seeding run in the BMX but he couldn't improve on his first time so will probably have a tough draw in the quarter-final knockout stages.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.35am:</strong> The Brits are still in the gold and silver medal places in the 10k open-water swim. One of the coaches has been shown a yellow card for throwing a drink at his swimmer instead of holding it out on a pole. I wonder if that means he'll be banned from coaching in the next open-water swim? Which will be when? This is the first one of these that I've ever seen. In fact, (MBMer adopts Columbo-like pose) is the Russian only unbeaten because she's never raced before?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.40am:</strong> John Lamberson from beach volleyball-central, Hermosa beach, California, brings us the answer to the reason Brazil are playing Brazil in the men's semi-final. \"Each country is allowed a maximum of two teams, as long as they are ranked in the top 24 in the world at the time of the games. There are a number of fairly boring reasons for this rule, which would put your already drowsy readers to sleep...\" Eh watch it John! \"But I would like to mention that there is a very large and impressive list of countries participating in international competitions, including a group of plucky Brits. About the only place it isn't played is the middle east and Indian subcontinent, which is understandable due to a general aversion to standard beach volleyball gear (bikinis and such).\" This is the home of rules readers. Oh yes.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.45am:</strong> There's a little under a 1km left in the open-water swim and the Brits are still leading. Former swimmer and Michael Phelps lookalike Stephen Parry reckons there's going to be fisticuffs in the final straight. I'd like to see how that takes place when they're underwater. But when there's gold up for grabs the Brits have been up for a scrap. Could this be gold No17 for Britain?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.50am:</strong> This is the most exciting open-water race I have ever witnessed. I think you can guess why. The Brits are still gamely leading as they have done for 1hr51min so far. It's been one hell of a brave swim. None of the swimmers have been kicking their legs much in order to save their strength for the sprint finish, but expect them to start thrashing them like crazy anytime soon.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.55am:</strong> Ilchenko has started to make her move wide in order to try to pass the wall made by Payne and Patten. They need to up their pace here with just about 200m left. It looks like they've pulled away far enough from the chasing group to guarantee a medal apiece, but Ilchanko is coming alongside now.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.59am:</strong> Ilchenko is dead level with the Brits. She's showing rapid pace here.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4am:</strong> With 50 metres left Payne is level with Ilchenko while Patten has dropped into third. This is an exciting finish.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.01am:</strong> Ilchenko shows why she is world champion by pulling away by a couple of metres to take gold. Keri-Anne Payne finishes with a silver and Cassie Patten wins bronze. That was a brilliant effort by the British women. They put a hell of a lot of effort into leading for so long, but were rewarded.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>4.04am:</strong> \"Gregg... I can't get to a TV. Can you tell if any of the open-water swimmers are doing the Trudgen?\" asks Tim Maitland. MBMer frantically searches for dictionary and finds a load of French gobbledegook that he can't understand. MBMer reads rest of email and sighs with relief. \"It was the answer to a clue in the Times crossword in today's South China Morning Post (\"developing swimming stroke\" if you must know).\" I didn't see much trudgening going on Tim, but I can tell you that Cassie Patten is mighty upset about the race. Apparently that pesky gold-medal winning Russian, Ilchenko was pulling on her feet to stop her from racing away.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>4.10am:</strong> Right, back to the BMX and Shanaze Reade is about to go off on her second run. Remember she fell in the first so a good run is imperative if she is to give herself a decent draw in the semi-finals.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>4.14am:</strong> There she goes... This time she flies around the first corner safely, hops over a dozen sandy hills and clocks a time of 36.8 to put herself second in the seedings. That was more like it. She's the world champion and showed why with that zippy run.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>4.20am:</strong> \"Just noticed that, according to the BBC live text commentary page medal table, GB have 16 golds, 0 silver and 0 bronze. Have we had them taken away from us for boasting?\" asks a perplexed Mike Barraclough. Very strange Mike. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/medals/full\">Our site is still showing those medals</a> to be in place but if British athletes suffer some bedroom burglary in the athlete's village (note to self - I might want to edit that at some stage, sounds wrong) we know which media organisation to investigate first.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>4.30am:</strong> I can tell you that in the big one, oh yes, the one you've been waiting for: Men's Water Polo Classification 7-12, Match 1 - Match 3, the Canadians have been beaten by the Italians 13-11. Unlucky Canada. It's a bad day for fans of Maple leaves.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>4.37am:</strong> I've just allowed myself a minute to watch the Taekwondo. It's pretty brutal stuff. I get the impression, above all else, the aim of the game is to kick the opponent in the head as hard as possible. The way they throw their legs about it's like watching <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=IqhlQfXUk7w\">that clip from Monty Python's Ministry of Silly Walks</a>, but just a tad more violent.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4.40am:</strong> \"Is feet pulling ok then (all's fair in love and salt water?)\" asks Claire Garner, who earlier was stunned by my personal reply to her email request for the finish time of the open-water swim. We're a friendly MBM bunch here Claire. \"Or do we lodge an appeal or something?\" MBMer flicks through his open-water swimming rules book. MBMer finds rule ZX12: I believe the chance to appeal has been lost because Ilchenko wasn't sanctioned at the time. She could have been given a yellow card apparently, but wasn't. I think that's why anyway. Ah, the BMX men's quarter-finals have just started. Brill!</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4.45am:</strong> The first quarter-final gets off to a crashing start. This is great. BMXs tumble into each other left, right and centre as they fly over the jumps and race around the bends. From the resulting carnage M. Day of USA wins in a time of 36.170. In the second, less dramatic BMX quarter-final GB's Liam Phillips finishes fifth. There's a second run coming up though, so results will be confirmed after that.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4.50am:</strong> If you want to read all about GB's Keri-Anne Payne and Cassie Patten's silver and bronze medals in the open-water swim you can do so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>5am:</strong> The interweb's been down for a few minutes here so just catching up on your emails. \"I'm wondering if the delay in the 10km medals is because Ilchenko may be getting disqualified for the leg-pulling incident,\" asked Pommie Barsteward. I've just seen the medal ceremony I'm afraid Mr Barsteward so that's a no-goer.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>5.10am:</strong> \"\"What on earth is BMX-ing doing in the Olympics?\" Harrumphs John Senior. \"What next? Subbuteo? The 200m Scalextric time trial? On second thoughts, if the world champion's a Brit, let's pad the BMX-ing out with lots more categories for 2012. BMX Team Pursuit, BMX Individual Pursuit, BMX Madison, BMX Keirin, and BMX...\" Whoah, hold on John, the BMX-ing has been great despite whether the Brits are any good at it or not. Perhaps it could be padded out to include all that X-Games business. Skateboarding and rollerskating can get involved too. Sod the Olympic purists!</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>5.12am:</strong> Meanwhile, the second run of the BMX quarter-finals have started and Mikey Day of the US still leads overall. Romero of Argentina takes a horrible fall and eats the tyre of the rider in front of him. Oooh! There's blood gushing from his torn elbow. He looks alright, despite the pain. GB's Liam Phillips finishes sixth this time round so I expect he'll struggle to qualify.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>5.15am:</strong> \"Open water swimming is brutal,\" whoops Jacob Murray-White. \"They beat the hell out of <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/beijing2008/open-door-in-games-closes-for-hackett/2008/05/04/1209839456445.html\">[Grant] Hackett</a> in the qualification and he ended up being disqualified.\" It looked a bit tasty out there when Patten and Payne were trying to keep ahead of the pack, but I can't imagine swimmers have the energy or inclination to take a swing at each other.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>5.23am:</strong> \"Paul in Sydney here...\" Hiya Paul. \"Good to see the Aussie Kamakazi lived up to his name, by being involved in a crash in his heat of the BMX. But I suppose 'Clean Run To The Finish' doesn't make for as snappy a name?\" I think you'll find Rochdale rider Clean Run To The Finish didn't qualify for Beijing Paul. He was getting a tattoo of a bear put on to his forehead apparently.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>5.30am:</strong> \"Just saw the replays from yesterday's weightlifting,\" says eagle-eyed Kyle Hauptman. \"Steiner from Germany won the heavyweight division (105kg) by lifting 258kg in the clean and jerk (that's over your head and holding it there for a moment) on his last lift.\" Crikey! \"I'll throw this out there: of all the things that Olympians do, this could be the furthest from the average person's ability. A lot of things at the games are amazing, like swimming 10k, but just look at the weight these guys put above their heads. The human body/spine is NOT SUPPOSED to do that.\" Good shout Kyle, but you've flummoxed me. The only other thing I can think of is some of the jaw-dropping flips the gymnasts pull off. If we were all doing that whenever we made a trip to the corner shop the world would be a chaotic place.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>5.35am:</strong> The third run of the men's BMX quarter-finals has just kicked off. GB's Liam Phillips needs a career-best run to qualify for the semis. The 20-year-old looks pensive at the start. With the number of crashes there have been so far it's little wonder why. And off they go...</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>5.38am:</strong> Oooooooh! Ooooowwwww! That had to hurt. About five riders - including Briton Liam Phillips - clatter into each other as they hit the first corner. Phillips gets to his feet and finishes seventh, which means he won't make the semi-finals. This has been a brutal spectacle. Kyal Bennett of the US has to have treatment on his left arm for five minutes before finally getting to his feet and milking the crowd's applause as he limps to the finish line.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>5.45am:</strong> The wonderfully named Bob De Wilde (pronounced Builder) and Kamikazi are in action in heat three, run three. Australian Kamakazi tries to restore some national pride with a ballsy run to finish third. To all the Australian readers out there, your man should make the semi-finals now. Whether you care or not is another matter, but this is all that's happening at the moment so you'll have to bear with me.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5.50am:</strong> I can confirm that Australia's Kamikazi did indeed live to fight another day in the BMX. He qualifies with his compatriot Jared Graves for the semi-finals. I'm getting pretty delirious now so I'm going to pass the MBM baton onto Paolo Bandini, who looks much more alert than he probably feels. Thanks for all your emails. I hope we can get together again at the next big open-water swimming event. I can't wait!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>6.05am</strong> Good morning folks. I've just been sticking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicscycling1\">this report on the Shanaz Reade's BMXing efforts</a> up all over the website, so why don't you distract yourselves having a gander at that while I get myself sorted?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>6.15am</strong> Right then, the women's RS:X windsurfing is about to start, where Bryony Shaw is currently third in the standings, and can still win gold ... Actually, it already started once, but something went wrong so they're doing it all over again.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>6.19am</strong> Shaw's off to a good start, they're definitely saying that a lot on the telly, but frankly the pictures they're showing me aren't helping me to work out exactly how well. We basically haven't seen her since the start ...</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>6.23am</strong> A snipped of TV commentary insight: \"The wind has changed direction and that will favour Bryony Shaw ... But those pictures we're seeing now suggest I've actually got that wrong.\" I think my favourite thing about the Olympics is that in 64% of the sports involved, nobody <em>really</em> has a clue who's winning until the last 10 seconds.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>6.29am</strong> \"That Bmx sounds like good viewing,\" chirrups Scott Mellor, a man with a keen sense of hearing. \"Unfortunately I'm in China and the only coverage I have is of the baseball where the score is China 0-17 Cuba. As I'm not familiar with this sport, could you tell me - is this good or bad for China? Otherwise the other sport covered is trampolining which is something I stopped participating in when i was 14.\" Your loss on the trampolining Scott, and as for the baseball I'd say that's average to good going when playing against Cuba ...</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>6.33am</strong> OK, in the last five seconds, the Beeb's commentary team has stated that we could be on for silver ... or bronze ... or gold in the windsurfing if Shaw maintains her current positioning. Apparently it's all about where the Chinese sailor finishes.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>6.36am</strong> \"According to my Chinese colleagues, Team GB are second,\" pipes up Steve George apropos the windsurfing. \"Then again, two minutes ago they were asking me what the rules were ...\"</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>6.41am</strong> China are right back in that baseball game at 17-1.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>6.43am</strong> Ooh - could be trouble here in the windsurfing - Shaw was in the way of Spain's Alabau on a turn, and now the Spaniard's thrown a wobbly and called for the referee ...</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>6.44am</strong> ... But the umpire bounces over in his dinghy and raise a red flag against Alabau, meaning she has to do a penalty turn. Shaw looks a safe bet for a medal now, though it'll probably only be bronze.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>6.49am</strong> Yup, <strong>bronze it is for Bryony Shaw</strong>, and she looks happy with that. Rather more happy is China's Jian Yin, who finished behind Shaw in this race, but retains gold, leaving Italy's Alessandra Sensini to take silver.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>6.55am</strong> \"I'msohappyI'vehadsuchatoughweekandIlovemymumandshe'ssuchalegend andI'mjust so[badword]happy\", offers a painfully high-pitched Shaw in-between blubs of joy. Oh come now, it was only a <em>bronze</em> medal.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>7.05am</strong> \"While Team GB clearly deserves a great big pat on the back for doing so well in Beijing, I'm not sure if you understand quite what you're getting yourselves into,\" pipes up Scott Donaldson from Sydney. \"I'd say you're only a couple of gold away from having an absolute stormer by anyone's estimation. This runs the huge risk that you lot will go the way of the Australian sporting media: taking everything far too seriously and oscillating wildly between blind hero worship and vindictive tall poppy bashing ... with nothing (amusing or otherwise) in between.\" I'm going to assume Scott's never been in England when the football's been on before.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>7.13am</strong> Nothing too exciting for Team GB fans going on right now, so let's take a whizz round some of the other sports. France have beaten Russia 27-24 in the handball, Italy and Poland are tied at two sets all in the volleyball and a Canadian is running round the stadium wearing nothing more than a pair of bright red lycra hotpants at the softball. Have I just stumbled upon the real reason the IOC decided to cut the latter sport from the bill ahead of London 2012?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>7.20am</strong> \"Bryony Shaw deserves more credit than you have given her,\" states Jack Springate, correctly. \"Most of our medals at this Olympics have come from the great British pastime of sitting on your arse (cycling, rowing, sailing). Surely a medal at an activity which requires standing up out of your seat warrants greater appreciation?\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>7.28am</strong> \"Hi, I've put together a simple page that ranks countries by their medals per capita and also by the GDP/medals for each country,\" offers Tom - speaking as if <a href=\"http://www.symworld.com/medals/\">this</a> was a perfectly ordinary thing to do. My life feels that little bit more complted now I know that Bahrain has the best ratio of gold medals to population of any country.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>7.37am</strong> The men's RS:X is under way at last, with Britain's Nick Dempsey chasing another medal for Britain, having started the race second in the table. I'm not going to lie to you, I missed the start because I was busy watching Italy beat Poland in the quarter-finals of the men's volleyball.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>7.40am</strong> Tom's table (7.28am) is about to get a lot more complicated. \"If GDP matters, then perhaps government funding for Olympic teams should matter as well,\" parps Kyle Hauptman. \"The USA is one of the few teams that get zero government funding - their funding is entirely private. Most people don't know this.\"</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>7.44am</strong> Things aren't going well for Dempsey. At last check he was seventh, and on course to finish fourth over all, though my experience of windsurfing would suggest that this may also mean that he is in any position from first to last and could still be on for either a gold medal or a pelting with rotten eggs. In the meantime, the French contestant has fallen off his board.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>7.52am</strong> <strong>New Zealand have taken gold in the men's RS:X</strong>, but it's still not looking good for Dempsey, who needs to pass the Frenchman in front of him to get bronze ...</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>7.54am</strong> Yeah, Dempsey's bottled it. Well, \"bottled it\" is probably a bit unfair - it was a very short race, just one lap, which made it nigh on impossible to recover from a less than sterling start - but hey, fourth place finishes won't improve that GDP/medals ratio any ... \"Tom's tables are impressive, but not really water cooler material,\" opines Gary Naylor. \"How about number of medals compared to number of media staff in Beijing on expenses (the BBC's Phelpsian numbers may hurt GB there), medals compared to drug convictions, medals compared to tears shed on podium etc?\"</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.02am</strong> In their interview after the 10km open water swim, Patten and Payne suggested that they could look forward to business class flights home because they had both won medals. Extrapolating this further, can we assume that Yngling gold medal winner Sarah Ayton will be travelling in the posh seats, while fiancee Dempsey folds himself into an economy seat? Equally, will Mark Cavendish be the lone British cyclist in the back of the plane?</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.06am</strong> More fun with medal tables, as Tobias Trotter points us in the direction of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/08/04/sports/olympics/20080804_MEDALCOUNT_MAP.html\">the New York Times' medal <em>map</em></a>, which roughly resembles a normal map, only with each country replaced by a giant smartie that grows or shrinks in size depending on the number of medals they won in whichever Olympic year you select. Plus it's supported by some of the most gloriously awful muzak you've heard in some time.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.14am</strong> OK, I'm actually quite a big fan of incomprehensible sports, but seriously now, what on earth is synchronised swimming about?</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>8.20am</strong> I've been pondering over these last six minutes, and I've decided that synchronised swimming would definitely be my choice of sport to cut from the Olympics if the IOC wanted to get rid of one more before London 2012. Should the opportunity arise, I would replace it with crazy golf. Just because. Any other suggestions for sports we could do with in four years time?</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8.28am</strong> It's quarter-finals time in the men's basketball and Spain are 37-26 up at half-time against Croatia. Which is rather low scoring, when you think about it. Iceland are beating Poland 28-26 in the handball.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>8.34am</strong> At last, some clear-headed thinking from Andrew Jolly. \"I think we should replace the synchronised swimming with Morris Dancing,\" he poses. \"It's more or less the same, and let's face it, most countries other than GB are going to struggle to field a team.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>8.43am</strong> Right, the combined effects of sleep deprivation and a whole morning without a British gold medal have turned my brain to goo, so I'm going to hand over to fresh-faced Robin Lynch. Thanks for all your emails.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>8.46am: Morning all.</strong> If you've just started work and are looking forward to a long day's skiving, I'll bring you up to speed on today's highlights.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>8.49am:</strong> We could see a third British boxer through to the semi-finals when <strong>middleweight James DeGale</strong> takes on Kazakhstan's Bakhtiyar Artayev at 1.01pm.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>8.57am: </strong>In <strong>Athletics</strong>, the gold medal hopes (fairly optimistic hopes, to be honest) for Britain are <strong>Christian Malcolm</strong> in the Men's 200m (3.20pm) and <strong>Tasha Danvers</strong> in the Women's 400m (3.35pm). But of course, the big draw tonight will be <strong>Usain Bolt.</strong> Can he break Michael Johnson's record in the 200m? Will he actually run the whole race or stop halfway for a breather? What will Sue Barker say to a crestfallen Michael Johnson afterwards?</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> In the Men's Pole Vault qualifying rounds, <strong>Steve Lewis</strong> is Team GB's man. That's at 1.40pm.</p> <p>Wow, you guys really <strong>hate synchronised swimming</strong>. More on that in a minute.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.01am: </strong>Watch out for Britain's <strong>Emily Freeman</strong> in the Women's 200m semi-finals at 3.04pm, <strong>Michael Rimmer</strong> in the Men's 800m first round and Somalia-born <strong>Mohamed Farah</strong> in the Men's 5000m first round.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.03am:</strong> Finally, if you're Irish you can look forward (sort of) to <strong>Alistair Cragg</strong> in the men's 5000m first round and <strong>Darren John Sutherland</strong> in the middleweight quarter-final.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.08am:</strong> But the real battle for Ireland at these Games is the light-heavyweight semi-final between plucky upstart Kenny Egan and imperialist nemesis Tony Jeffries. That's on Friday.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> In alternative sports news, Ryan Spencer wants to boot out synchronised swimming and bring in the multi-event-athlon. The MBM lawyer is peering over my shoulder but I can reveal that the multi-event-athlon consists mostly of petty crime and drug dealing. And he wants to base it in my neigbourhood! Harrumph!</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> Leading the poll so far on new sports for Lahndahn 2012 are darts, snooker, morris dancing, <em>Eton Fives </em>and ....cheese rolling. Clearly you fine chaps have wandered on here by mistake while in search of the Daily Mail. But wait! Bruce Jackson raises a concern.<br> \"Synchronised swimming could be replaced by that chasing the cheese down a hill thing. Although there's always the suspicion that the French might be quite good at that,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>9.18am: </strong><strong>More French-bashing. </strong> This time it's Tim Maitland. And he's not kidding.</p> <p>\"In defence of synchronised swimming it did provide one of the greatest sports stories of all time when it was pointed out to the French team prior to the Atlanta Games that their routine re-enacting the Holocaust (I kid you not) might be... err... a tad tasteless.\"</p> <p>But Morris Dancing is acceptable?</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>9.21am: Mandatory score update.</strong>Spain lead Croatia in basketball 72-59. Tum-te-tum.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>9.24am:</strong> Joe Milton is getting a bit sweaty thinking about all those hormones in the Olympic Village.</p> <p>\"I think Kiss Chase is due a welcome return! And from what I hear about the antics in the Olympic Village it could be an interesting one,\" he snickers. </p> <p>Also in contention: British Bulldog, Kick-the-can and Truth or Dare.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>9.28am: </strong>Inevitably, gloriously, triumphantly, <a href=\"http://pseudscorner.blogspot.com/2007/02/blogging-admitted-to-olympics-shock.html\">Gary Naylor</a> suggests <strong>Blogging</strong> for the 2012 roster. And I think we've got a nailed-down gold medal right there. </p> <p>Do you lose points for flaming? Disqualification for using too many smileys? Bonus scores for raising LOLs from your rivals?</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>9.32am: </strong>\"What about the 800m Freestyle Moaning-about-the-weather?\" wonders Ben Holloway. I'd back it all the way Ben, if only because Ireland would take a clean sweep on the podium. All. Day.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>9.36am: </strong>And if you've been punching your screen with rage at the thought if your beloved synchro swimming, here's a report what I wrote all by myself from this morning's action.</p> <p>Russia's reigning Olympic champions, the \"two Anastasias\", defended their synchronised swimming duet gold medal on Wednesday with an almost perfect routine swum to the strains of Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt suite.<br>Anastasia Davydova and Anastasia Ermakova, undefeated at a major championships since finishing second at the 2001 worlds, scored a perfect 10 for technical merit from all five judges and earned another three 10s for artistic impression.<br>Added to a commanding lead from Monday's technical routine, they easily claimed victory with 99.251 points, bagging a second gold medal for a collection started in Athens. </p> <p>So there you go.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>9.38am:</strong> \"<strong>Beach Volleyball</strong> is the second most played sport in the world,\" lies Hazel Irvine. 800 million players worldwide, apparently. Keep the synchronised swimming I say, get beach volleyball <em>out</em> of there. I can't take it seriously since they played Tom Jones' magnum opus, <strong>Sex Bomb</strong>, during one of the games on Monday. I mean, really.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>9.38am:</strong>If this anti-synchro swimming tirade continues, I shall have to inform Lord Coe. Michael Lee makes an <strong>anti-public school jibe</strong>, which I cannot repeat here, but involves Eton Fives and onanism. Ugh.</p> <p>On a much more wholesome note, Mike Hopkin (who I suspect is a atudent, unemployed or 97) suggests Olympic Countdown. \"Played with proper English spellings of course, so we'll always beat the Americans!\" he huzzahs.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>9.43am: </strong>Stuart Wilson also went to a comprehensive school.</p> <p>\"What about scrumping for apples, where public school boys line up to sneak tasty golden delicious out of the orchard? The last one to get dragged back to the dormitories by the janitor for a good towel whipping is the winner.\"</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>9.49am: </strong>Just to bring you up to date on the BMXing, in case you didn't stay up all night/don't live in Australia/haven't grasped how internet browsers work. <strong>Shanaze Reade</strong> who is going for gold (Gold! Always believe in your sooooul) will be top seed in tomorrow's semi-final, despite falling over on her first run.</p> <p>Not so hot for <strong>Liam Phillips</strong> though. His Olympics are over after being knocked out in today's quarter-finals.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>9.51am: </strong>My local neighbourhood, as well being blighted by petty crime and soft drugs abuse, is being terrorised by BMX gang warfare. The Switchblades currently have the upper hand over the Cobras, but to be honest I suspect most of them have played Eton Fives in the past. And probably morris dancing too.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>9.57am: </strong>Earlier this morn, Britain's first <strong>Taekwondo</strong> competitor <strong>Michael Harvey</strong> suffered a gallant defeat to world silver medallist Guillermo Perez. Sadly for Mike, Britain don't cheer on gallant defeats any more. But he does have a chance of making the repechage if Perez reaches the final.</p> <p>Harvey thought he had scored a winning point in overtime after fighting back from 2-0 down in the -58kg bout to tie 2-2. But the pesky judges scored for the Mexican.</p> <p>Harvey said: \"I caught his pad but obviously it wasn't hard enough or the judges missed it. I thought I had a good chance going into that last round but obviously it didn't go the right way. I did well because I was up against the world silver medallist but he was there to be beaten and I'm a bit gutted that I've lost. It's great experience for London 2012 but I wanted to go a bit further.\"</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>10.02am:</strong> Staunch republican John Senior has a pop at them lot in Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>\"Cut the synchronized swimming and revive It's a Knockout for 2012.<br>Even better, let's have It's a Royal Knockout, with monarchs from<br>around the world whacking each other with giant foam sticks while<br>balancing on slippery poles above a pool of green slime. First one in<br>the gunk gets the guillotine...\" he cries, pasting his stamps upside down and tearing up \u00a35 notes as he does so.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>10.06am: Drugs bust.</strong> There could be a shake-up in the heptathlon final positions after Ukrainian silver medallist Lyudmilla Blonska failed a drug test on the 'A' sample. If she fails the 'B' too, she'll lose her medal. This won't really affect Team GB's Kelly Sotherton, who was fifth.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>10.15am:</strong> They haven't expelled athletes for swearing since 1912, but Britain's pottymouth windsurfing bronze medal winner Bryony Shaw pushed the IOC to their limits today (see 6.55am). It was one of the really bad ones, too.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>10.19am: Plucky underdog corner.</strong> Tired of exulting in Britain's successes? Feeling the burden of superpowerdom? Yearning for the good old days of taking on the big boys?</p> <p>Feast your eyes on this: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7738727\">Poland (population: 40,000,000) have lost to Iceland (population: mostly puffins) in the handball.</a> </p> <p>\"It was great, I still cannot believe it. We're such a small country and we won against a 40-million-people country. Now there's going to be a handball boom in Iceland,\" added the sadly misguided Alexander Peterssen.</p> <p>\"We get about 500 spectators per game,\" Iceland right back Olafur Stefansson added. \"It's understandable, sometimes there's bad weather and you don't want to go driving 20 minutes through the snow when you can watch TV instead.\"<br><em><br>Sometimes</em> there's bad weather?</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>10.25am: Drugs update.</strong> Roger Cook, who I fear is not thoroughly embracing the Olympic spirit, says: \"Don't be so negative about Kelly Sotherton's chances - look on it as one down, three to go.\"</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>10.28am: Olympic Swearing </strong> This why they call the BBC 'Auntie'.</p> <p>\"We apologise for any offense caused earlier today when Bryony Shaw swore live on air. Our reporter on the spot Rob Walker apologised immediately and Adrian Chiles apologised again when the footage cut back to the studio,\" a spokesperson said.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>10.39am: </strong><strong>Montenegro</strong> have beaten Croatia 7-6 in the quarterfinals of the Men's Water Polo. Which is nice, given that Montenegro only became an independent nation in 2006. They'll play Hungary in the semi-final. </p> <p>I understand Ukrainian heptathlete Lyudmila Blonska's 'B' test has come out positive for anabolic steroids, not that you'd know from looking at the official website of the Games, where all is sunny and bright and nothing bad ever happens.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>10.46am: Expert punditry.</strong> William Hoyle is extremely ticked off. It's a double-grrr situation.</p> <p>He fumes: \"That <strong>Blonska</strong> lady grrr\u2026.! If you could have chosen someone to fail a drug test it would have been her.\" Bit harsh William, no?</p> <p>He lists his reasons:<br>1) Dodgy eastern European attempt at dyeing hair\u2026.check<br>2) Ludicrously overly made up in attempt to hide steroid induced acne\u2026.check<br>3) No humility whatsoever for her drug induced past\u2026.check</p> <p>\"\"For her part, Blonska has responded to such criticism by saying that using steroids was \"a mistake in my life\", and adding, \"I have managed to prove that I can compete again\"\" So she got two years for her first \"mistake\" how can she explain her second - and proves that 2 year drug bans are a waste of time. Grrrrr.\"</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>10.52am: </strong>Five American bloggers have been arrested in Beijing for a pro-Tibet demonstration. No doubt they can live-blog from their cells. Or perhaps just a quick Twitter. With unhappy smileys.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>10.55am: Down with Camembert. </strong>Not content with stealing their Olympics, Fran Schindler is now attacking the French cheese industry.</p> <p>\"I'm not sure that Bruce Jackson has to worry too much about France's potential prowess at cheese rolling.

It looks like she won't be taking any part in that, even if she promises to be very very good. And given that she has already served a two-year suspension from 2003-05, a lifetime ban is very much on the cards. That'll learn you.</p> <p>The third-place finisher in the heptathlon was American Hyleas Fountain, who would be bumped up to the silver if Blonska is disqualified.

It's only two automatic qualifiers from each heat, and Rimmer was almost knocked back into fourth in the final 100m.\"I always perform better in the semi-final though,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>Inevitable gag:</strong> \"Is it just me or is there anyone else out there who just can't get Red Dwarf's resident smeghead out of their mind when we keep hearing about Michael Rimmer ?\" sniggers Steve Marsden.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>12.26pm:</strong> Ireland's Thomas Chamney finished fifth in his heat, so virtually no chance of making one of the fastest loser slots.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> <strong>Boxing</strong> Russia's Georgy Balakshin is taking on India's Jitender Kumar in the biggest clash of the superpowers since I Drago v R Balboa.</p> <p><strong>Britain's James DeGale</strong> is up in four bouts' time and <strong>Ireland's Darren John Sutherland</strong> in three.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>12.33pm: Diving</strong> Britian's Tonia Couch and Stacie Powell are currently performing in the <strong>Women's 10m Individual Platform</strong>. Scores coming up now....</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>12.37pm:</strong> It's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/20/birds_nest_view_live_minutebym.html\">Anna Kessel</a>! She's in Beijing! Not north London!</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>12.39pm: Diving </strong>It's not looking great for Tonia Couch or Stacie Powell at the moment. The top 18 qualify for the semi-finals and Tonia is currently 23rd after her first dive, while Stacie is 29th*. Will them to win, Readers. Shout at your screen. Invoke your chosen deity. Whatever it takes.</p> <p>*last.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>12.45pm: Athletics </strong>Almost done in the men's 800m heats. Next up on the track is the <strong>Men's 5000m</strong> heats, while in the field it's currently the <strong>Women's Hammer Throw</strong> final.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>12.51pm: Diving </strong>Ha! I told you organised religion works. Tonia Couch is up to 12th with her second dive. Stacie Powell's up next.</p> <p><strong>Athletics</strong> Bringing you updates on the hammer asap. It's all going horribly wrong out there...</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>12.52pm: Diving </strong>Boom! Powell up to 22nd. She'll need to reach 18th to make the semis though.</p> <p><strong>Hockey</strong> China have beaten Germany 3-2 and are into the women's final. The Netherlands vs Argentina up next.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>1.07pm: Athletics</strong> China's Wenxiu Zhang has just thrown 74.40m in the hammer, which is quite good, I believe, and puts her into top spot.</p> <p>Just to let you now that each competitor gets five dives in the 10m individual platform.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> Ireland's Darren John Sutherland is taking on Venezuela's Alfonso Blanco Parra in the middleweight quarter-finals. Ireland have only two medals so far, guaranteed bronzes for boxers Kenny Egan and Paddy Barnes, so a win here would be a welcome boost.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>1.12pm: Diving </strong>Tonia Couch scores 76.50 on her third dive, a big improvement on her first two, 67.20 and 63.00. She's in seventh now. </p> <p>In the <strong>Boxing</strong> Darren John is getting the better of Parra, who is swinging wildly. It's 3-0 to Sutherland.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>1.16pm: Boxing </strong>Great defence and a body shot with the left gives Sutherland a further point. </p> <p>And he does it again! 5-1 now, after the Irishman dropped his guard for the first time in the fight and let Blanco in for a jab. It' s looking good for a third medal for Ireland here.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>1.19pm: Boxing </strong>Parra beat Sutherland in the world championships but he is getting a pummeling here. And it's mostly due to a much improved performance from the Irishman, rather than a sloppy display from Parra. 9-1 at the end of the third and Blanco really cannot handle him, mentally or physically.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>1.21pm: Diving</strong> Now it's Powell's turn to zoom up the board. She lies in 15th after a third dive of 75.20. </p> <p>In the <strong>Boxing</strong>, it's medal number three for Ireland after a stunning performance from Darren John Sutherland. The Irish contingent are singing in the crowd and Jim Neilly is putting on corny Irish accents. Which is okay, cos he's Irish himself. But still a bit lame.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>1.26pm: </strong>Blanco is the world silver medallist, Jim tells me. It was 11-1 in the end to Sutherland. He <em>battered</em> him.</p> <p>Britain's James DeGale comes in now, he's got a big challenge against Kazakh fighter Bakhtiyar Artayev.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>1.30pm: Boxing</strong> It's cagey so far. DeGale leads 1-0 after the first round, a reward for a sharp left hook into Artayev's body.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>1.32pm: </strong>More of the same from DeGale. He's moved in for a fast attack after a strong defence..and again! He concedes one that time as well, but he's getting on top. It's 4-1 to the Briton at the halfway mark. Artayev must find a plan B.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>1.35pm </strong>They swap points early on, before another left jab from DeGale. He's standing back now on 6-3, and looking to take that lead into the final round.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>1.36pm: </strong>He's done better than that, he's bumped it up to 7-3 and we look set for another GB-Ireland semi-final. Sutherland and DeGale have fought each other five times so it should make for an interesting bout. Still two minutes to go though..</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>1.39pm: </strong>8-3 and DeGale is jumping with delight. That was a tough opponent - the world bronze medallist - and he outfought and out-thought him all the way through. Didn't go for unnecessary points and worked the counter-attack brilliantly. <strong>Bronze for Britain</strong> (at least). That's three bronzes so far for Britain, and three for Ireland.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>1.43pm: Diving </strong>62.40 for Tonia Couch on the fourth dive; not spectacular but enough to lift her in seventh place. She just needs a competent final dive top reach the semi-final. </p> <p>Stacie Powell on the other hand is in 19th and outside the qualifying positions. She'll have to do better than that next time around.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>1.47pm: Athletics </strong>Mo Farah is out front for Tea GB in the <strong>Men's 5000m</strong> first round heats. He looks comfortable. Well, as comfortable as a man can be after several laps of pegging it round an Olympic stadium in stifling heat.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>1.50pm: Athletics</strong> Farah leads but the pack are on top of him. It's four to go through with one lap to go. This is the clutch play...</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>1.52pm:</strong> Yargh! Mo is slipping back...he's going nowhere.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>1.52pm:</strong> They're sprinting away and Mo can only manage sixth. He'll have to wait and see if he makes one of the first loser slots.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>1.54pm:</strong> A bad run for Farah. He topped a group of six and the other five all left him for dust inside the last 100m. The second heat is coming up now; Mo put on a final sprint to make sixth in 13:50.95mins.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>2.02pm: </strong>In the <strong>Women's Hammer</strong>, Aksana Miankova of Belarus threw an Olympic record of 76.34m to take gold, with Cuba's Ypsini Moreno took silver with 75.20m and China's Wenxiu Zhang was third in 74.32m</p> <p>Minkova seems to have wandered in from the 5,000m; she is really quite slender. Especially for a hammer thrower. Dagger stares in the changing-room, I reckon.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>2.06pm: Factoid</strong> Three gold medals would lift Ireland to 18th on the medals table, as things stand. Three bronzes would mean....70th. In between Armenia and Taipei.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>2.08pm: Athletics </strong>Ireland's Alistair Cragg is in fact still in with a chance of making one of the <strong>Men's 5,000m</strong> fastest loser slots.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>2.11pm:</strong> Cragg ran 13:38.57mins with Spain's Aelemayehu Bezabeh ahead of him in 13:37.88mins. The final heat has just finished, and it's Australia's Craig Mottram in fourth with 13:44. That means Cragg will make the semi-finals with Juan Luis Barros of Mexico, who finished in 13:42.70mins.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>2.16pm: </strong>The <strong>Diving</strong> has finished and both Couch (12th) and Powell (14th) will make the semi-final. They face a stiff challenge to progress further than that though. China's Ruolin and Xin Wang Chen finished first and second with Canada's Emilie Heymans in third.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>2.23pm:</strong> Somewhere in Beijing there are men using poles to lift themselves over different poles. If anything amazing happens - such as one of the men <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/reutersComService_2_MOLT/idUKB18358820080818\">losing one of their poles</a> - rest assured you will be informed immediately . Well, not really. But definitely at some stage today.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>2.27pm: </strong>It's the <strong>Men's 110m Hurdles </strong>semi-finals coming up now in the Bird's Nest. This, of course, was the event which Chinese sporting icon Liu Xiang was expected to win, before he hobbled off in the first round with an ankle injury. </p> <p>And the Chinese are super annoyed. Because you can win all the judo, shooting and wrestling golds you want (and China currently have 45) but what you <em>really</em> want is a proper medal. Where people run and stuff.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>2.32pm: </strong>False start in the 110m hurdles first semi...Back you go.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>2.32pm: </strong>Here's a report from proper journalists on this afternoon's action. Read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicsboxing1\">this</a> for an account of James DeGale's pulverising of Bakhiytar Artayev. </p> <p>And in a crossover with our debonair chums on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media\">theguardian.com media desk</a>, here's some commentary on the<a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/08/the_bbcs_olympics_coverage_gol_1.html\"> BBC's coverage of the Games</a>.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>2.33pm: Athletics </strong>The favourite, Dayron Robles of Cuba, proves he is the bestest with first place in his <strong>Men's 110m Hurdles</strong> heat. Behind him are David Payne of the USA, France's Ladji Doucoure and Jamica's Richard Phillips.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>2.40pm </strong>In the second heat, and in the absence of Liu Xiang, China's Dongpeng Shi is carrying the hopes of 1.3b Chinese. No pressure there, then.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>2.41pm:</strong> Shi dives desperately for the line..and falls over as he does so. Maybe no one noticed?</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>2.42pm:</strong> Oh no! Fifth by two hundredths of a second for Dongpeng Shi. Let the gnashing of teeth commence. </p> <p>In first it's the USA's David Oliver then Poland's Artur Noga, Jackson Quinonez of Spain and another Jamaican, Maurice Wignall.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong><strong> Jackson</strong> is an unusual name in Spain, I would imagine.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>2.49pm:</strong> As promised, it's <strong>Men's Pole Vault</strong> news. Britain's Steve Lewis has successfully navigated the early stages of his qualifying round. There are two groups of 19, and 5.75m is the mark to beat. Failing that the 12 best performers in each round go through.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>2.59pm:</strong> <strong>Pole Vaulter</strong> Steve Lewis is out.There's controversy.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>3.05pm: </strong>I'll get the skinny on Lewis, as soon as the <strong>Women's 200m</strong> semi-final heat starring Great Britain's Emily Freeman is finished. So in around 20 seconds.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>3.06pm: </strong><strong>Women's 200m</strong> Alyson Felix, one of the favourites for this event, has won her heat. Emily Freeman is a long way back. Michael Johnson reckons that on these performances Jamaica's Veronica Campbell-Brown will take gold in tomorrow's final.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> It's time for the <strong>main events</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>3.14pm: Men's 200m FINAL</strong> In about five minutes we'll see if Usain Bolt can do better than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9w2-Z0qGzQ\">this</a>.</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>3.17pm:</strong> For many people, Michael Johnson's performance in the 200m at Atlanta was track running at its very best and his world record of 19.32secs was expected to stand for a long, long time.</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>3.18pm:</strong> Johnson predicts 19.5 secs. But he would, wouldn't he?</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong>: <strong>Don't forget</strong> Team GB's Christian Malcolm is running in this event, as is reigning Olympic champ Shawn Crawford. And also Kim Collins of St Kitts and Nevis. But they won't win*.</p> <p>*Disclaimer: They might win.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>3.22pm: </strong>They're off...Bolt is off on a flyer ... he's miles ahead...this is almost a joke... <strong>the world record is gone!</strong><br><strong><br>19.30 into a headwind!</strong></p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>3.24pm: </strong>Well that was amazing. I am shaking in my seat after an event that only lasted 20 seconds. Right from the start, Bolt peeled away in glorious fashion and unlike the 100m he kept it up right until the end.</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>3.26pm: </strong>From the man whose record we thought would stand for ever, Michael Johnson: \"I would have tried to hit the 100m mark at 10.2, 10.3. He looks to have hit it in 10 flat. He's bending into the line, not because he wants to beat the other guys who are well behind him, but because he wants that record.\"</p> <p>It's Martina Churandy of the Dutch Antilles in 19.82 and America's Shawn Crawford in 19.96. The USA's Wallace Spearmon was third, but has been disqualified for running out of his lane. We've just seen him walking round the track, celebrating a medal he's not going to get.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>3.32pm: </strong>They're now playing Happy Birthday in the stadium for Bolt, who turns 22 tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>3.37pm: Women's 400m Hurdles</strong> They're off! Tasha Danvers looking strong for bronze...</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>3.37pm:</strong> ...and almost silver...</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>3.38pm</strong> <strong>Bronze for Britain!</strong></p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>3.41pm:</strong> That's a magnificent result for Tasha Danvers, who wasn't expected to make the podium. Jamaica's Melaine Walker and the USA's Sheena Tosta, the two big stars, took gold and silver, but Walker slowed at the end and was almost caught by Danvers, who was almost passed herself by Ukraine's Anastasiya Rabchenyuk.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>3.43pm: </strong> That's yet another unexpected result for a British athlete and the third track and field medal for Team GB with Phillips Idowu still to come in the triple jump.</p> <!-- Block 186 --> <p><strong>3.46pm: </strong>Doug Falconer has spoken: \"How can Michael Phelps win 8 golds and not be the enduring icon of the Olympics ? Usain Bolt. That's how.\" Damn straight, Doug.</p> <!-- Block 187 --> <p><strong>3.48pm: Guardian Reports</strong> It's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicsathletics7\">Usain Bolt</a>! And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.bradleywiggins\">Bradley Wiggins </a>up to high-jinks!</p> <!-- Block 188 --> <p><strong>3:53pm:</strong> Tasha Danvers reached the Olympic final in Sydney, before taking two years out to start a family. This year she's had Achilles problems in May before struggling in the British trials in Birmingham. And now she's exceeded expectations and taken bronze.</p> <!-- Block 189 --> <p><strong>3.57pm: </strong>That's it from the Bird's nest for today. Don't miss <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/20/london_2012_should_move_the_go.html\">Will Buckley</a> on why those snooty toffs at Oxford and Cambridge should let Olympians use their facilities for 2012.</p> <!-- Block 190 --> <p><strong>4.16pm: </strong>Check back in tonight at 1:30am for live coverage, reports, blogs and unrestrained jingoism.</p> <p>Tomorrow's highlights for Britishers are <strong>Shanaze Reade</strong> at 3:30am in the BMX semi-final and hopefully final, and <strong>Phillips Idowu</strong> in the triple jump, starting at 1.30pm. Thanks for all your e-mails.</p>"
