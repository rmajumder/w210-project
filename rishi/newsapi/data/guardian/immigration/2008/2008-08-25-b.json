  "<p>Orlando Fals Borda, who has died aged 83, was an internationally respected sociologist of Colombia and Latin America and distinguished political figure active on the left. His two-volume work, La Violencia en Colombia (1962), Compiled with Eduardo Uma\u00f1a and Father Germ\u00e1n Guzm\u00e1n, detailed the terrible period of peasant slaughter that lasted for a decade after the assassination of the Liberal leader, Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n, in 1948. Soon recognised as a masterpiece, it introduced the complexities of Colombia's peasant politics to a wider world.</p> <p>Fals Borda came to believe that it was the duty of a sociologist not just to examine the social reality of the country, but to try to remedy the grave injustices that research uncovered. A close collaborator, with whom he set up the first sociology faculty in Latin America at the National University of Bogot\u00e1 in 1959, was Father Camilo Torres Restrepo, a charismatic priest who eventually joined the guerrillas of the National Liberation Army (ELN) and was killed in 1966. Fals Borda, equally committed to social and political change, chose a more peaceful road.</p> <p>Born in Barranquilla, northern Colombia, the son of presbyterian parents, Fals Borda completed his education in the US. There he studied with Nelson Lowry at the University of Minnesota, and later with T Lynn Smith at the University of Florida. Equipped with a doctorate in sociology, he re-established himself in Bogot\u00e1, determined to introduce the social sciences into Colombia's conservative curriculum. He had acquired an encyclopedic knowledge of the Colombian countryside, and worked in the ministry of agriculture from 1959 to 1961, but he was not a natural bureaucrat and had little enthusiasm for Colombia's string of governments that ignored the peasant population, and preserved the rights of landowners. He soon found himself a niche among Colombia's leftwing intellectuals and activists, helping to found Alternativa, a famous radical magazine in the 1970s, together with the writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and the journalist Enrique Santos Calder\u00f3n.</p> <p>In his academic role, Fals Borda developed a methodology known as participatory action research, combining research and theory with political participation. This became popular in several Latin American universities and intrigued his many admirers in Europe and the US. For years he was denied a US visa, his contacts with peasant movements regarded as subversive, but he eventually returned with honour in April 1995 to attend a conference of southern sociologists in Atlanta. There he delivered a speech in which he outlined four of his own guidelines for sociology researchers: \"Do not monopolise your knowledge nor impose arrogantly your techniques, but respect and combine your skills with the knowledge of the researched or grassroots communities, taking them as full partners and co-researchers. Do not trust elitist versions of history and science which respond to dominant interests, but be receptive to counter-narratives and try to recapture them. Do not depend solely on your culture to interpret facts, but recover local values, traits, beliefs, and arts for action by and with the research organisations. Do not impose your own ponderous scientific style for communicating results, but diffuse and share what you have learned together with the people, in a manner that is wholly understandable and even literary and pleasant, for science should not be necessarily a mystery nor a monopoly of experts and intellectuals.\"</p> <p>In January 1979, Fals Borda fell foul of the security statute enacted during the regime of President Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay Ayala. Together with his wife, Mar\u00eda Cristina Salazar, he was arrested and held incommunicado for three weeks, falsely accused of involvement with the M-19 guerrilla group. He was freed without charge, but his wife was not released until the following year. The M-19 guerrillas later came down from the mountains and formed a political movement, the Alianza Democr\u00e1tica M-19, and Fals Borda became one of their elected members in the constituent assembly of 1991. Later he became honorary president of the Polo Democr\u00e1tico Alternativo, which supported Carlos Gaviria as presidential candidate at the 2006 elections.</p> <p>Fals Borda wrote innumerable books and articles, publishing in 2003 after the death of Mar\u00eda Cristina, an autobiographical memoir, Antes la Crisis del Pa\u00eds, in which he recalled his friendship with Camilo Torres and reiterated his beliefs in the tenets of liberation theology.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Orlando Fals Borda, sociologist and political activist, born July 11 1925; died August 12 2008</p>",

  "<p>London 2012 has been wining and dining potential commercial partners in an attempt to harness the Team GB effect and wrap up its top-tier sponsorship programme before the year is out. While the venue-building Olympic Delivery Authority has been on the receiving end of generous hospitality from companies bidding for contracts, the organising committee for the 2012 Games has itself been lavishing hospitality in Beijing and London. The London 2012 commercial director, Chris Townsend, hosted a few select companies at the Beijing Games after they expressed a firm interest in taking up the London Olympics' \u00a365m top-tier sponsorship proposition. </p> <p>British success in the velodrome and on the rowing lake has, according to London 2012's deputy chairman, Sir Keith Mills, helped to \"accelerate discussions\". More talks were held at the handover party outside Buckingham Palace on Sunday where the top brass of potential backers were also invited.</p> <p>Having achieved two-thirds of its \u00a3650m sponsorship target already, London 2012 expects to bring in only two more top-tier partners, for a total of nine. It might seem that it would need all the revenues it can muster because the International Olympic Committee, which paid about \u00a3180m to Beijing, is set to lose the support of four of its 12 biggest commercial partners. But London 2012 has received assurances from the IOC that successors have been lined up to maintain or even increase central funding.</p> <p><strong>Gunnell vision</strong></p> <p>Sally Gunnell's grasp of what not to say when a microphone is put in front of her has clearly not improved since she left the BBC. Put up by London 2012 as one of the star former Olympians to big up the next Games, she was asked by the MC in the Mall on Sunday what the atmosphere must be like for British Olympians in Beijing. Gunnell, below, told the assembled audience of 40,000 who had schlepped from across the nation to be at the 2012 party: \"I wish I was there for the party.\"</p> <p><strong>Waiving the flag</strong></p> <p>London 2012 has cast itself as Britain's Olympics but the message has not translated well in the UK's devolved parliaments. Sunday's passing of the Olympic flag to London's mayor, Boris Johnson, has been commemorated with the raising of Olympic handover flags in 730 venues across the world. They have been flown at 62 Foreign and Commonwealth Office overseas missions and 13 British Council offices around the globe but conspicuously absent from the list of Olympic cheerleaders were the parliaments of Northern Ireland in Stormont and Scotland in Edinburgh. It comes at a time when there is rancour over that fact that only 10 of the more than 600 Olympic contracts won by businesses around the UK were handed to Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p><strong>Security shambles</strong></p> <p>Coming so soon after both Tessa Jowell and Sebastian Coe made more consumer-friendly security a key objective of London's hosting of the Olympic Games in four years, the admission system for Sunday's Visa 2012 handover party in the Mall was an untimely shambles. Ticket-holders were made to queue for hours outside the event as security staff, none of whom knew where anything was in the fenced-off complex, \"controlled\" access. Thousands funnelled in through two dozen gates at two pinch points while orange jackets laboriously checked bags and frisked party-goers before ripping ticket stubs and handing out wristbands. One woman who queued for 40 minutes said: \"This is embarrassing. I can't believe this is the first foreigners will see of London's Olympics.\"</p> <p><strong>Wiggins' lament</strong></p> <p>In a BBC interview in the Mall Bradley Wiggins decried the fact that sports coverage in \"football-obsessed\" Britain during the Beijing 2008 build-up had been dominated by Joey Barton's spell in jail. So the holder of three Olympic gold medals, one silver and two bronze must have been delighted that the biggest cheer in the Mall during the beam-back from Beijing of London's eight minutes was for David Beckham.</p>",
  "<p>Manchester City have made an official bid in the region of \u00a310m to bring Shaun Wright-Phillips back from Chelsea. The winger has become Mark Hughes' top priority for the final week of a transfer window in which City, for all their financial issues, could conceivably finish as the highest spenders in the Premier League.</p> <p>Having already signed the Brazilian striker Jo for a fee that will eventually rise to \u00a319m, plus the Belgian international Vincent Kompany for \u00a36m and Tal Ben Haim for an estimated \u00a35m, City are now ready to take their summer spending to the \u00a340m mark by taking advantage of Luiz Felipe Scolari's indifference when it comes to the player Chelsea recruited from Eastlands for \u00a321m three years ago.</p> <p>Chelsea are willing to accept an \u00a311m loss on the right-winger, whose availability has also prompted an inquiry from Everton about taking him on loan. City want a full transfer, something that appeals to Chelsea, and the only stumbling block is that Wright-Phillips is reluctant to leave London.</p> <p>The 26-year-old has misgivings about returning to Manchester and will need to be convinced not to remain on the fringes at Stamford Bridge. City hope he can be tempted by a salary that would make him the highest-paid player in the club's history.</p> <p>The money is available to City's owner, Thaksin Shinawatra, even though prosecutors in his native Thailand yesterday asked the country's supreme court to seize 76bn baht (\u00a31.2bn) of his assets frozen in Thai banks, accusing him of amassing extraordinary wealth after becoming prime minister in 2001. However, Shinawatra is confident of bringing in substantial investment to the club this week and has been negotiating with his associates from the Middle East over the past few weeks.</p> <p>If everything goes according to plan City will follow up their interest in Diego Milito, Real Zaragoza's Argentinian striker, and the Brazilian international Thiago Neves, who plays for Fluminense. City have had little encouragement over the last week and the club's executive chairman, Garry Cook, is concentrating on returning Wright-Phillips to a side that lacks a natural right-sided player.</p> <p>Chelsea hope the deal can be concluded as soon as possible so the money can be put towards their proposed \u00a328m signing of Robinho from Real Madrid. Although no fee has yet been agreed, Real paved the way for his departure by bidding \u00a337m yesterday for the Valencia forward David Villa. That was rejected but the Spain international has long insisted he favours a move to Madrid or Barcelona after Valencia struggled last season, and Villa may now agitate for a transfer. Madrid have made it clear they would be more prepared to lose Robinho, 24, once they have secured a replacement.</p> <p>City's Mexico forward Nery Castillo is set to end his spell at Eastlands and join Real Betis. He will undergo a medical today if a deal can be reached with Shakhtar Donetsk, who hold his rights.</p> <p>Chelsea's Andriy Shevchenko will complete his return to Milan today after undergoing a medical. The Ukraine international striker is expected to sign a one-year loan deal with an option to make the move long-term next summer.</p>",
  "<p>As the French president Nicolas Sarkozy thrashed out a ceasefire between the Kremlin and Georgia this month, a Georgian Airways plane touched down in Tbilisi carrying a team of his fellow countrymen who have been among the first on the ground in disaster areas and war zones for the past decade.</p> <p>The charity they work for has provided a vital service for bodies from the UN and World Health Organisation to Oxfam and Save the Children and has directly helped hundreds of thousands of people caught up in earthquakes, mud slides, famines and wars.</p> <p>The French team were taking telecoms equipment into the Georgian capital. T\u00e9l\u00e9coms Sans Fronti\u00e8res (TSF) has provided a vital link for aid agencies and a lifeline to friends and relatives from Iraq and Niger to Sri Lanka and Nicaragua.</p> <p>TSF - which has no connection with the medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res - is the brainchild of former caterer Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cazenave, whose only previous connection with the world of communications had been a brief stint with the French postal service that eventually split to form France T\u00e9l\u00e9com.</p> <p>Cazenave, transfixed by television news footage about the plight of the Kurds, got talking with a friend who worked for a British frozen foods company about how they could help.</p> <p>Ten days later, with $10,000 and 40 volunteers, they were ready to ship out clothes and other supplies in two lorries, one bound for Iran and the other heading for the Turkish border. In unmistakably French style, that first consignment also included 100,000 pieces of cheese. The trip to Kurdistan was followed by mercy missions to the Balkans the following year. But what surprised Cazenave on every trip was the reaction of the people he had come to help when it came time for the trucks to roll out again.</p> <p>\"When we left the camp they all gave us pieces of paper with a telephone number on them saying 'when you get back to France phone my friend, phone my father, phone my brother, say we are here, that their uncle is dead and that we are here and they have to help us'. That is how it began. During the war in Bosnia it was the same. In the 45 times I went there, every time we have come back from Mostar or Sarajevo and so on we had a list of people to call when we got home.\"</p> <p>He started to look into whether there were ways of setting up communications facilities into the refugee camps that had sprung up all over the Balkans and realised there was nothing.</p> <p>\"Every time we saw the same thing - there is a need for victims to be able to communicate. And all the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) also need telecommunications.\" </p> <p>So he went back to his local council with a proposal and the mayor bought Cazenave his first satellite phone.</p> <p>Now 53, the doughty Cazenave would not look out of place running a vineyard. The early days of TSF, officially started in 1998, confirms his job is a lot harder than it first appears. On one of his first outings he was threatened by an angry Albanian who put a gun to his head and the following year was taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs. </p> <p>\"Part of the problem is that I have a big mouth,\" he jokes in his heavily accented English. \"Now I am more, not relaxed, but careful about what I say.\"</p> <p>His first trip, to Albania in 1998, proved him right. He had gone out there with one satellite phone to help refugees from Bosnia.</p> <p>\"We opened our little centre, in a village school, and a load of people came. What was fantastic was that a few days later I remember seeing people arriving in cars to take away their family and we thought 'this idea is good'.\"</p> <p>When he got back, he founded TSF along with some of his former colleagues, including Monique Lanne-Petit, who remains a director.</p> <p>On one mission the following year in Macedonia, TSF had 400 people turn up to make calls the first day. Two days later there were 25,000 and a queue a mile long and the media started to take notice of the Frenchman with a satellite phone. From there the team went to Kosovo. Cazenove had 6,000 francs (\u00a3700) in his pocket and plans to stay for two weeks. He ended up staying for more than a year and by the end of it, TSF was operating under a UN mandate.</p> <p>TSF then became involved in disaster relief after the 1999 earthquake that struck Izmit in western Turkey. TSF volunteers took some of the kit from Kosovo to help out. \"It was our first intervention for a natural disaster. We stayed there for 10 days.\"</p> <p>Since then TSF has been out on more than 70 missions to 50-odd countries. It has attracted the backing of the Vodafone Group Foundation, the United Nations Foundation, the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO), satellite communications groups Inmarsat, Eutelsat and Vizada, telecoms companies AT&amp;T and Cable &amp; Wireless and the Regional Council of Aquitaine. It now has 20 full-time staff and twice that number of volunteers.</p> <p>Only two countries have defeated TSF. It reluctantly pulled out of Iraq, because the queues of people waiting to use the phone could attract suicide bombers, and Burma, where the regime refused it access to the Irrawaddy delta after the cyclone hit the region this year.</p> <p>TSF has expanded its operations in recent years, not just setting up communications hubs for NGOs, but also using the latest generation of satellite phones - which provide internet and send pictures - to put people in remote areas in touch with distant medical facilities.</p> <p>In the west African state of Niger, ravaged by famine, TSF has put in place communication services in 37 locations to help the government's national food crisis prevention system. In South America it trains people in impoverished areas to use the latest IT systems.</p> <p>At its core TSF does exactly what it started out doing 10 years ago and is doing it right now in Georgia: providing vital communications to people who have lost absolutely everything.</p> <p>During that 10 years, TSF has suffered only two accidents - give or take the odd kidnapping. One volunteer was injured in Iraq and more recently one of the team in Niger contracted malaria.</p> <p>Cazenave says: \"The most dangerous thing we do is use the local equipment, like cars and helicopters. We go to poor countries and the cars are old and we drive very fast because we have to arrive very quickly. The helicopters we have to use are sometimes helicopters that should not be made to fly but in an emergency you have no choice.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tsfi.org\">tsfi.org</a></p>",
  "<p>In his book Late Victorian Holocausts, Mike Davis tells the story of the famines that sucked the guts out of India in the 1870s. The hunger began when a drought, caused by El Ni\u00f1o, killed the crops on the Deccan plateau. As starvation bit, the viceroy, Lord Lytton, oversaw the export to England of a record 6.4m hundredweight of wheat. While Lytton lived in imperial splendour and commissioned, among other extravagances, \"the most colossal and expensive meal in world history\", between 12 million and 29 million people died. Only Stalin manufactured a comparable hunger.</p> <p>Now a new Lord Lytton is seeking to engineer another brutal food grab. As Tony Blair's favoured courtier, Peter Mandelson often created the impression that he would do anything to please his master. Today he is the European trade commissioner. From his sumptuous offices in Brussels and Strasbourg, he hopes to impose a treaty that will permit Europe to snatch food from the mouths of some of the world's poorest people.</p> <p>Seventy per cent of the protein eaten by the people of Senegal comes from fish. Traditionally cheaper than other animal products, it sustains a population that ranks close to the bottom of the human development index. One in six of the working population is employed in the fishing industry; about two-thirds of these workers are women. Over the past three decades, their means of subsistence has started to collapse as other nations have plundered Senegal's stocks.</p> <p>The EU has two big fish problems. One is that, partly as a result of its failure to manage them properly, its own fisheries can no longer meet European demand. The other is that its governments won't confront their fishing lobbies and decommission all the surplus boats. The EU has tried to solve both problems by sending its fishermen to west Africa. Since 1979 it has struck agreements with the government of Senegal, granting our fleets access to its waters. As a result, Senegal's marine ecosystem has started to go the same way as ours. Between 1994 and 2005, the weight of fish taken from the country's waters fell from 95,000 tonnes to 45,000 tonnes. Muscled out by European trawlers, the indigenous fishery is crumpling: the number of boats run by local people has fallen by 48% since 1997.</p> <p>In a recent report on this pillage, ActionAid shows that fishing families that once ate three times a day are now eating only once or twice. As the price of fish rises, their customers also go hungry. The same thing has happened in all the west African countries with which the EU has maintained fisheries agreements. In return for wretched amounts of foreign exchange, their primary source of protein has been looted.</p> <p>The government of Senegal knows this, and in 2006 it refused to renew its fishing agreement with the EU. But European fishermen - mostly from Spain and France - have found ways round the ban. They have been registering their boats as Senegalese, buying up quotas from local fishermen and transferring catches at sea from local boats. These practices mean that they can continue to take the country's fish, and have no obligation to land them in Senegal. Their profits are kept on ice until the catch arrives in Europe.</p> <p>Mandelson's office is trying to negotiate economic partnership agreements with African countries. They were supposed to have been concluded by the end of last year, but many countries, including Senegal, have refused to sign. The agreements insist that European companies have the right both to establish themselves freely on African soil, and to receive national treatment. This means that the host country is not allowed to discriminate between its own businesses and European companies. Senegal would be forbidden to ensure that its fish are used to sustain its own industry and to feed its own people. The dodges used by European trawlers would be legalised.</p> <p>The UN's Economic Commission for Africa has described the EU's negotiations as \"not sufficiently inclusive\". They suffer from a \"lack of transparency\" and from the African countries' lack of capacity to handle the legal complexities. ActionAid shows that Mandelson's office has ignored these problems, raised the pressure on reluctant countries and \"moved ahead in the negotiations at a pace much faster than the [African nations] could handle\". If these agreements are forced on west Africa, Lord Mandelson will be responsible for another imperial famine.</p> <p>This is one instance of the food colonialism that is again coming to govern the relations between rich and poor counties. As global food supplies tighten, rich consumers are pushed into competition with the hungry. Last week the environmental group WWF published a report on the UK's indirect consumption of water, purchased in the form of food. We buy much of our rice and cotton, for example, from the Indus valley, which contains most of Pakistan's best farmland. To meet the demand for exports, the valley's aquifers are being pumped out faster than they can be recharged. At the same time, rain and snow in the Himalayan headwaters have decreased, probably as a result of climate change. In some places, salt and other crop poisons are being drawn through the diminishing water table, knocking out farmland for good. The crops we buy are, for the most part, freely traded, but the unaccounted costs all accrue to Pakistan.</p> <p>Now we learn that Middle Eastern countries, led by Saudi Arabia, are securing their future food supplies by trying to buy land in poorer nations. The Financial Times reports that Saudi Arabia wants to set up a series of farms abroad, each of which could exceed 100,000 hectares. Their produce would not be traded: it would be shipped directly to the owners. The FT, which usually agitates for the sale of everything, frets over \"the nightmare scenario of crops being transported out of fortified farms as hungry locals look on\". Through \"secretive bilateral agreements\", the paper reports, \"the investors hope to be able to bypass any potential trade restriction that the host country might impose during a crisis\".</p> <p>Both Ethiopia and Sudan have offered the oil states hundreds of thousands of hectares. This is easy for the corrupt governments of these countries: in Ethiopia the state claims to own most of the land; in Sudan an envelope passed across the right desk magically transforms other people's property into foreign exchange. But 5.6 million Sudanese and 10 million Ethiopians are currently in need of food aid. The deals their governments propose can only exacerbate such famines.</p> <p>None of this is to suggest that the poor nations should not sell food to the rich. To escape from famine, countries must enhance their purchasing power. This often means selling farm products, and increasing their value by processing them locally. But there is nothing fair about the deals I have described. Where once they used gunboats and sepoys, the rich nations now use chequebooks and lawyers to seize food from the hungry. The scramble for resources has begun, but - in the short term, at any rate - we will hardly notice. The rich world's governments will protect themselves from the political cost of shortages, even if it means that other people must starve. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A hundred years after the appearance of one of the strangest and least enticing advertisements in newspaper history - \"Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages. Bitter cold. Long months of complete darkness. Constant danger. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success\" - a single brave soul is being sought to shuffle along in the heroic footsteps of Ernest Shackleton. </p> <p>To mark the centenary of the explorer's unsuccessful Nimrod expedition to the south pole, six descendants of Shackleton and his crew are offering a member of the public a place on their polar jaunt. This time round, the specification is a little less bleak.</p> <p>\"We want someone whose cup is always half-full, never half-empty; who will be the first to volunteer for the cooking rather than crawling into their sleeping bag; who can laugh at themselves and keep others' spirits up when the chips are down,\" said Lieutenant Colonel Henry Worsley, a descendant of Frank Worsley, Shackleton's skipper on the Endurance, the ship used on a later expedition.</p> <p>The adventurer will have to be fit, though, to keep up with the rest of the expedition, which consists of Worsley and five others, among them Shackleton's great-grandson, Patrick Bergel.</p> <p>Three of the latter-day explorers will set off in October on the same 900-mile, 80-day route chosen for Shackleton's 1908-09 expedition. Ninety-seven miles from the pole - at the point where low food stores and blizzards forced Shackleton and his team to turn back on January 9 1909 - they will meet the other four members of the group. From there, they will attempt to achieve what Shackleton never managed by hauling their 300lb (136kg) sleds all the way to the pole. The seven-strong team will take the compass that Shackleton himself used to navigate his way through the barren landscape and will rely on copious quantities of porridge to power them through the 10 hours of sled-lugging they will put in every day.</p> <p>Unlike Shackleton, they will not use ships or ponies. After flying in from Punta Arenas in Chile, they will be dropped on Ross Island, at the edge of the Ross ice shelf. If all goes well, they will fly out from the pole 80 days later.</p> <p>The final expedition member, who will take part in the second leg of the trek, will have to undergo fitness and psychometric tests and panel interviews. He or she will then have to see off competition from four other finalists during endurance training in north Wales to secure a place on the trip. </p> <p>To get a taste of the 50mph headwinds and -35C (-31F) temperatures in Antarctica, he or she will also have to complete a crossing of Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic.</p> <p>\"This is an amazing, unique opportunity,\" said Worsley, who has been in the army for 25 years. \"It has taken us five years to get the trip off the ground but anyone reasonably fit, who goes to the gym and is a strong team player, can apply to join us for the last 12 days of the trek.\"</p> <p>Worsley, 47, from Hereford, will undertake the full route with a City worker, Will Gow, and a shipping lawyer, Henry Adams. Gow, 35, from Ashford, Kent, is related to Shackleton by marriage, and Adams, 33, from Snape, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, is a great-grandson of Jameson Boyd Adams, Shackleton's number two on the unsuccessful expedition. </p> <p>As well as Shackleton's great-grandson, Bergel, 36, from London who works in advertising, the other expedition members are: Tim Fright, 24, from Billingshurst, West Sussex, a great-great-nephew of Frank Wild, the only explorer to accompany Shackleton on all his missions; and David Cornell, 38, from Andover in Hampshire, another great-grandson of Boyd Adams. </p> <p>The new expedition is being used to launch a \u00a310m Shackleton Foundation, which will fund projects that embody the adventurer's spirit and hunger for \"calculated risk\".</p> <p>This time round, though, there will be no wages at all for the intrepid explorers. The team members might, however, bolster themselves with the thought that Shackleton was knighted when he returned to the UK, despite falling 97 miles short of the pole.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To apply for the place on the expedition go to <a href=\"http://www.matrixgroup.co.uk/shackleton\">www.matrixgroup.co.uk/shackleton</a></p>",
  "<p>A thinktank close to the government has criticised current immigration policy, issuing a warning that the entrepreneurial spirit and inventive flair of migrant communities will be lost to the UK unless ministers change their thinking. </p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has found that employers and local economies benefit from the skills brought by migrants, but the full positive effects are not being realised since most migrants only stay in the UK for short periods.</p> <p>The IPPR says that of more than one million migrants who came to the UK from the eight countries that joined the EU in May 2004, around half have now returned home. The thinktank says councils and the government need to try to reverse this.</p> <p>The full report, which will be published next month, will suggest councils and businesses discuss with universities how to better harness the skills of their foreign students. It will also call for the accreditation of foreign qualifications, which enables migrants to be recognised in the UK, to be fast-tracked.</p> <p>The IPPR's findings will shore up one element of the government's position - that migrants add value to the British economy. Ministers believe immigration added \u00a36bn to the economy in 2006.</p> <p>The researchers argue that any analysis of the economic value of migrants should also take into account how they expand the market for local firms through links to their countries of origin. Harvard research done in California shows that for every 1% increase in migrant population, Californian exports to their countries of origin increased by 0.5%.</p> <p>The economic value of immigration was challenged by a House of Lords report in April which concluded that immigrants had \"little or no impact\" on the UK's economy, with a negative impact for the low-paid and an increase in house prices. The Lords, including two ex-chancellors, backed a limit on immigration levels, in line with the Tory party's position.</p> <p>But Laura Chappell, research fellow at the IPPR, also raised concerns about the government's points-based system, which calibrates how much the UK needs the skills of a worker or student seeking to enter the country.</p> <p>She said: \"Under the new system, no low-skilled migrants will be allowed into the UK from outside the EU. That is a large amount of people who are being written off ... but who add a huge amount to the diversity of an area and local economy.</p> <p>\"We're also worried that the system is based on a short-term economic analysis of what migrants bring to a country ... A migrant may be entrepreneurial once they have arrived in this country - ie, they 'create' a skill. We just don't know.\"</p> <p>The IPPR research draws on three studies conducted in the last few years in Germany and America, each showing that as the number of migrants in a community increased, so too did the number of inventions patented in that area.</p> <p>A home office spokesman said: \"Migrant labour is by no means the only solution to our tight labour market. The National Skills Strategy was launched to address the needs of our domestic labour force.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dems welcomed the report, but said the government was not flexible enough to balance the benefits the IPPR report suggested with the extra pressures that can be placed on local services by extreme and concentrated immigration.</p>",
  "<p>Oliver Tickell defends against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange\">my critique</a> his visions of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange\">4C leading to a catastrophic future</a>. Two casual observations lend themselves readily. First, Tickell has entirely abstained from defending his claim for human extinction from 4C. Thanks. Second, I was clearly wrong when I said that Tickell's claim for 70-80 metres of sea level rise had maxed out campaigners' scare potential because that means all ice is melted. Showing an amazing ability to raise the stakes none the less, Tickell now talks about sea level going 100m higher.</p> <p>The UN climate panel (IPCC) says that 4C will lead to a rise a hundredth of that figure; but Tickell simply claims such moderate projections are \"dangerously misplaced\". All I can see is that such facts are terribly inconvenient.</p> <p>He summarily dismisses (as \"outdated econometric models\") the analysis of one of the IPCC lead climate economist authors, when the model points out that the damage will be quite modest at 3.5% of GDP. He assures us this \"is not to dismiss economics as a whole\" \u2013 because he can find two economists who support his argument, embracing Stern and Weitzman eagerly. It is hard not to see this as opportunistic cherry-picking: Stern might have been incomplete but his work \"yielded many useful findings \u2013 not least that swift and decisive action to mitigate climate change is\" the right way to go.</p> <p>I will not deal with Stern here. Many others have pointed out that the Stern Report has seriously exaggerated the peer reviewed evidence and massaged the analysis to get his results (see, for example, Byatt et al, 2006; Carter, de Freitas, Goklany, Holland, &amp; Lindzen, 2006; Dasgupta, 2006; Mendelsohn, 2007; Nordhaus, 2006e; R. S. J. Tol, 2006; R. S. J. Tol &amp; Yohe, 2006; Varian, 2006; Yohe, 2006, see also <a href=\"http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110009182\">my critique</a> in my book Cool It). Weitzman, who Tickell likes when he agrees with him, actually criticises Stern: \"As economic analysis the Stern Review dwells in a non_scientific state of limbo.\" Even then, Stern never did a proper cost-benefit analysis. Such analyses overwhelmingly show that strong early carbon cuts are a bad idea.</p> <p>But it is interesting to assess Weitzman's argument (My arguments are partly indebted to <a href=\"https://ecgs.llnl.gov/2008/docs/1-Energy/Weitzman_comment_090407.pdf\">Professor Nordhaus (pdf)</a>). Tickell (and many other campaigners) fancies Weitzman, because his economic argument seems to support draconian climate policies. While very technical, it relies on a fairly straightforward gist. All risks you can think of \u2013 even catastrophic ones \u2013 have non-zero risk. Thus, it is possible (if not very likely) that global warming will not only increase the planet's temperature by 4C, but 10C. Heck, it might even increase beyond 20C \u2013 which Weitzman with armchair climatology, suggests might have a probability of 1%. Since evidence for or against such extremes is scarce, accumulating evidence can only slowly close us in on their true probability. Yet, for any given amount of evidence, there will always be sufficiently outrageous risks (think 30C) that are sufficiently unbound by evidence and sufficiently close to negative infinite utility that the total net utility is negative infinity. Thus, we should be willing to spend all our money to avoid it.</p> <p>Now, in principle all economists would agree that non-trivial risks should be included in the model, and for example, Nordhaus has done that analytically in cost-benefit models (they still show that large emission cuts are not warranted). However, the Weitzman result curiously means that the more speculative and fuzzy the extreme event, the more it counts in the total utility. </p> <p>This is an argument driven by a technicality \u2013 essentially a claim that we are willing to pay an infinite amount to avoid even an infinitesimal risk of annihilation. Yet we demonstratively aren't \u2013 and shouldn't be. Civilization-ending asteroids hit the earth once every 100m years, but at present we only spend $4m per year to track them. Maybe we should pay $1bn. But we shouldn't spend everything.</p> <p>This underscores the fatal flaw in the Weitzman argument. When we allow all scary, fuzzy concerns onto centre stage, there is no end to where we should spend all our money. Every conceivable policy measure has a non-zero risk of catastrophe and so should be avoided at any cost. Biotechnology, <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-strangelet.htm\">strangelets</a>, runaway computer systems, nuclear proliferation, rogue weeds and bugs, pandemics, and asteroids are just a small sample of the areas each of which we should spend all our money on.</p> <p>Tickell doesn't deal with these arguments at all. As with Stern, he simply picks Weitzman because the policy conclusion fits. Tickell then claims that spending $2tn annually on large-scale emissions cuts will provide the best insurance for mankind. But this ignores that investments in energy R&amp;D will probably long-term cut 11 times more CO2. Moreover, if our goal is not just to cut CO2 but to help people and the planet, we can do even more good by focusing on simple solutions such as investing in nutrition, health and agricultural technologies. Instead of avoiding a couple of thousand extra malaria deaths in a century cases through expensive CO2 cuts, maybe we should avoid a million malaria deaths now through low-cost health policies. </p> <p>Tickell's reply clearly shows what happens when policy drives the search for suitable facts. The IPCC is simply ignored, Stern is praised for his policy usefulness, Weitzman embraced irrespective of his analysis essentially leading to policy paralysis, driven by extreme and pervasive speculative risks. Not surprisingly, Tickell ends by saying \u2013 without a shred of evidence \u2013 that his policy would be the best solution, \"even without the threat of global warming\". </p> <p>Not only does Tickell abandon his central claim of human extinction, but he also abandons his entire argument for his policy. Not much remains.</p>",

  "<p>Went to dinner last night with my dear old friend J. and his groovy new wife E. on the apparently famous <a href=\"http://www.larimersquare.com/\">Larimer Square</a>. It was the first time any of us had been there.

The red and white design belongs to the Crossland family.</p> </blockquote> <p>Runners-up: Indiana, New Mexico and Rhode Island. Worst flag: Mississippi of course, which features the Confederate stars and bars. And why does the Union Jack occupy the upper-left quadrant of the flag of Hawaii?

  "<p>The controversial Ben Stiller comedy Tropic Thunder sped over the finishing line in first place at the US box office at the weekend, easily beating off the challenge of newcomer Death Race with a haul of $16.1m in its second week.</p> <p>The Jason Statham-headed action film about a prison where inmates compete in a brutal race for their freedom in souped up vehicles had been expected to take the top slot, but it could manage only third place on debut with a disappointing $12.3m.</p> <p>Another new arrival, comedy The House Bunny, took second place with a better-than-expected $15.1m.
