  "<h2>Great Britain</h2> <p><strong>1. Saltwater, Nottingham</strong></p> <p>The only rooftop bar in the city, Saltwater is a pretty impressive set-up; a terrace that can hold up to 250 party-goers, either for lazy days in the sunshine or slightly more energetic nights. The cocktail menu is impressive and the formal (yet still pretty affordable) indoor restaurant is a good spot for supper. Heat lamps and canopies mean you can party alfresco pretty much whatever the temperature; a good thing, with summers like ours.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>0115 924 2664; <a href=\"http://www.saltwater-restaurant.com\">saltwater-restaurant.com</a></p> <p><strong>2. The Roof Garden, Great John Street Hotel, Manchester</strong></p> <p>Feast your eyes on vistas of Coronation Street and Castlefield; not quite an idyllic Mediterranean scene but the cityscape makes an exciting backdrop for a drink or two, and there's even a hammock for total chilling. The Roof Garden is open until 10pm for non-residents (though only hotel guests can use the alfresco hot-tub so you might be tempted to check in too). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>0161 831 3211; <a href=\"http://www.greatjohnstreet.co.uk\">greatjohnstreet.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>3. The Glasshouse, Edinburgh</strong></p> <p>The Glasshouse offers a shady, lavender-scented haven away from the hustle of the streets below. There is an immaculate lawn, edged with tables where you can eat or just have drinks and watch the sun set over Calton Hill.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>0131 525 8200; <a href=\"http://www.theetoncollection.com\">theetoncollection.com</a></p> <p><strong>4. Coq D'Argent, London</strong></p> <p>Right in the throbbing commercial heart of the City of London - next to the Bank of England, the Royal Exchange and Mansion House - is this oasis of calm, a rooftop garden complete with lawns and ornamental box hedges. There's a (very) pricey indoor restaurant, but a more reasonably priced list of bar snacks for eating outside. Sit on the lawn with your drink or gaze smugly down on the suits hurrying along the pavements far below. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>020 7395 5000; <a href=\"http://www.coqdargent.co.uk\">coqdargent.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>5. Rockwell, Trafalgar Hotel, London</strong></p> <p>Arguably the best-located rooftop bar in the capital, perch on one of the stools that look out across Trafalgar Square and you're practically eye-to-eye with Lord Nelson. It's a small space, and the chic white sofas and parasols give it a slick, Ibiza-at-sunset feel. A word of warning - it's often closed for private parties, so ring ahead to check.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>020 7870 2900; <a href=\"http://www.thetrafalgar.com\">thetrafalgar.com</a></p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p><strong>6. Rooftop Bar, Hotel Raphael, Rome</strong></p> <p>In the heart of Rome, near the vibrant Piazza Nova, this is a great place for soaking up the atmosphere without having to contend with the tourist hordes. You can see the Vatican from the picturesque terrace and the surrounding patchwork of colourful roofs - stop for a coffee by day, or cocktail by night and if you're peckish you can dine on great Italian cuisine.<br><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 39 06 682831; <a href=\"http://www.raphaelhotel.com\">raphaelhotel.com</a></p> <p><strong>7. La Terazza Rose, St George Hotel, Rome</strong></p> <p>You have to like ros\u00e9 if you're going to drink at La Terazza; it's the only bar in Europe to be dedicated exclusively to ros\u00e9 wines. Actually, there is one other option - champagne, served up with platters of seafood which make a suitably swish supper for this sleek cream and stone-coloured space. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 39 06 686611; <a href=\"http://www.stgeorgehotel.it\">stgeorgehotel.it</a></p> <p><strong>8. Sky Lounge, Hotel Continentale, Florence</strong></p> <p>This wide, decked terrace, edged with long cream sofas and plumped-up cushions, at the top of the medieval Consorti Tower, is the cherry on the cake at the Continentale; perfect for peering down at the hordes on the Ponte Vecchio, or taking in the panoramic view along the River Arno and out to the countryside beyond. Open from 11am until midnight, it attracts a stylish crowd in the evenings. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 39 055 2726 4000; <a href=\"http://www.lungarnohotels.com\">lungarnohotels.com</a></p> <p><strong>9. Skyline, Hilton Molino Stucky, Venice</strong></p> <p>Come on up for breathtaking views along the Guidecca Canal as far as Piazza San Marco, while you enjoy an aperitif or cocktail. It's lovely by day and very romantic at night, with the lights of Venice twinkling on the water. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 39 041 2723311; <a href=\"http://www.hilton.com\">hilton.com</a></p> <h2>Croatia</h2> <p><strong>10. The Top, Adriana Hotel, Hvar</strong></p> <p>Hvar is Croatia's hippest destination; a picturesque town of polished cobbles and terracotta-roofed houses, with a clutch of newly renovated elegant hotels. One, the Adriana, has a fabulous bar - aptly named The Top; all sleek sofas, chrome bar stools on multi-level terraces, and a clientele of blinged-up Russians and yachting types, all keen to point out their gin palaces bobbing in the harbour below.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 385 2175 0200; <a href=\"http://www.suncanihvar.com\">suncanihvar.com</a></p> <h2>Turkey</h2> <p><strong>11. 360, Istanbul</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-381270343\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/08/30/roofist460x276.jpg\" alt=\"The 360 bar in Istanbul\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drink in the view: the spectacular 360 bar in Istanbul, Turkey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a city with many rooftop bars, 360 continues to be the most spectacular. A spacious restaurant with floor-to-ceiling windows opens out onto a huge terrace where you can eat, drink or - later - get a shimmy on with Turkey's rich and beautiful, when the bar turns into one of the city's hippest clubs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 90 21225 11042; <a href=\"http://www.360istanbul.com\">360istanbul.com</a></p> <h2>Cyprus</h2> <p><strong>12. The Cliff Bar, Grecian Park Hotel, Protaras</strong></p> <p>This lovely bar overlooking the sea is all dark wood floors, wicker furniture and comfy cushions.

The hotel's a delightful boutique pad in a restored 18th-century building and the roof's a very relaxing spot for chilling by day or night. It opens until midnight in the summer. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 351 2134 08220; <a href=\"http://www.bairroaltohotel.com\">bairroaltohotel.com</a></p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p><strong>14.

The Penthouse, ME, Madrid</strong></p> <p>Aim to get to ME, the former Hotel Reina Victoria, before midnight or you will spend the rest of the night queueing. Currently one of Spain's hottest bars, it's hard to tell whether the gorgeous clientele are punters or bar staff; the accent on good looks may well be down to the fact the bar is owned by Randy Gerber, otherwise known as Mr Cindy Crawford. Dress up, and pack a stack of euros - this kind of glamour doesn't come cheap.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 34 9154 18200; <a href=\"http://www.memadrid.com/\">memadrid.com</a></p> <p><strong>16. Universal Etnia Terrace, Hotel Azahar, Seville</strong></p> <p>Alfresco teahouse by day, cocktail spot by night, and rather crowded dance space in the early morning, the Etnia Terrace is the only rooftop spot in the old town that is open year round. Sometimes there are dance performances in the evenings, and the food options are startlingly eclectic - from sushi to ostrich and kangaroo steaks. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 34 9543 84109; <a href=\"http://www.espacioazahar.com\">espacioazahar.com</a></p> <p><strong>17. L'elephant, San Rafael, Ibiza</strong></p> <p>The wide, square terrace at L'Elephant has played host to just about everyone from Paris Hilton to Jade Jagger and doubles as a pre-dinner cocktail bar, and a post-supper club. It can be a little attitude-y, so glam up if you want to get in, but it doesn't get more classically Ibizan than lazing on one of the square, cream sofas with a capirinha, while the DJ gets all ambient beneath the stars.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 34 9711 98056; <a href=\"http://www.elephant-ibiza.com\">elephant-ibiza.com</a></p> <p><strong>18.

Galaxy Bar, Athens Hilton, Athens</strong></p> <p>Nibbling on dim sum while gazing at the Acropolis can feel a bit surreal, but the Galaxy Bar serves up an Oriental, rather than meze, snack menu on its open-air terrace. There is a formal restaurant as well, and later in the evening the whole set-up morphs into more of a club, with guest DJs keeping it buzzing until four in the morning.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 30 21072 81111; <a href=\"http://www.hilton.co.uk/athens\">hilton.co.uk/athens</a></p> <p><strong>21. Cavalieri, Corfu Town, Corfu</strong></p> <p>There's more to Corfu than grisly resorts such as Kavos; Corfu Town has stunning Venetian architecture, and elegant cobbled streets and squares - best looked down on from above with an icy gin and tonic. The rooftop bar at the Cavalieri Hotel offers the best vantage point, with views extending over the roofs to the countryside beyond. The ice cream is pretty spectacular too.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 30 26610 39041; <a href=\"http://www.cavalieri-hotel.com\">cavalieri-hotel.com</a></p> <p><strong>22.

Arrive early to bag a table on the outdoor terrace for an evening of vodka cocktails under the stars (there's indoor space too, with a glass wall when the weather turns). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 749 578 31234; <a href=\"http://www.moscow.park.hyatt.com\">moscow.park.hyatt.com</a></p> <h2>Czech Republic</h2> <p><strong>24. Bazaar Mediterranee, Prague</strong></p> <p>The long walk up Nerudova, is matched by the haul up the winding stairs when you finally reach Bazaar Mediterranee - but it is all worth it. The view is stunning. Avoid the downstairs restaurant that specialises in rather odd 'shows' (prancing chaps in spangly leotards) and instead sip a martini and gaze down at the tourist hordes battling up Mala Strana, Prague's busiest street. Booking essential. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>00 422 5752 5050</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p><strong>25.

  "<p>When Gordon Brown sits down tomorrow at the conference table with the 26 other EU premiers in the glass-fronted Justus Lipsius building on Brussels's Rue de la Loi, the significance will not be lost on any of those present. The last time they sat in emergency session was in 2001, immediately after al-Qaeda's attack on America. </p> <p>This time, they will be meeting to consider Russia's military actions in response to Georgia's attempt to retake South Ossetia. Those present are likely to agree with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband who declared last week that a new era in international relations was upon us: the post-post Cold War, as former US Secretary of State Colin Powell originally framed it. Russia's intention to absorb both South Ossetia and Abkhazia into the Russian Federation is being treated as a move of that magnitude.</p> <p>History, to reverse Francis Fukuyama's pronouncement on its ending, has decisively begun again. The 'new world order' envisaged in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, an order in which liberal democracies would proliferate across the world as the United States exercised a benign global hegemony, has proved to be a mirage. First 11 September and then the debacle of Iraq shattered that happy illusion nurtured in the thinktanks of Washington. </p> <p>Now, in the space of a few weeks, Putin's tanks have buried it once and for all. In the face of protests, exhortations and furious remonstrations, Moscow acted as it saw fit in what it considers the Russian backyard, and damned the consequences, assuming there would be none of any note. This is no unipolar world, designed to Western specifications.</p> <p>In Syria, Libya, even Turkey (a US and European friend) politicians and analysts have noted the consequences of the Georgian crisis - not for what Russia has done but for what the US, EU and Nato have been unable to do: exercise their power to protect an ally.</p> <p>Trading of accusations has accelerated, with Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin charging - in language that would not seemed out of place coming from the lips of dour Soviet Cold War-era Minister for Foreign Affairs, Andrei Gromyko - that the US had armed Georgia for war, and suggesting that US military advisers may have been present during fighting.</p> <p>'I do think this is a pivotal moment,' says Stephen Flanagan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, 'not least with Russia's rapid recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It puts into question one of the fundamental assumptions of the post-Cold War era - you don't change borders. Or at least you don't if you're one of the key stakeholders.'</p> <p>Flanagan's assessment is echoed by a senior European diplomat working on the Georgia crisis, who says: 'The widely held view among people who think about these things in Europe as well as Washington, was that Russia was determined to respect borders at the ending of the Soviet Union. That is the major change.'</p> <p>But if there is agreement that one era of diplomacy has passed, there is less agreement over the nature of the new period and how to negotiate its uncertainies.</p> <p>For Ivan Krastev of the Centre for Liberal Strategies - and Republican presidential nominee John McCain's foreign policy adviser, Robert Kagan - the Georgian crisis echoes the power plays of a century ago. 'Europe,' he wrote soon after the fighting, 'has entered a new 19th century, vapourising the end-of-history sentiment that shaped European politics in the 1990s and replacing it with an older, geopolitical calculus in a modern form.'</p> <p>On the surface, at least, the return to gun-boat diplomacy appears confirmed by the spectacle of the warships of five nations cluttering the Black Sea, and US and Russian troops competing over two of Georgia's ports. But if a new Cold War is coming it is clear it will not be much like the old - or even the brief outbreak of conflict in Georgia. With a high oil price, \u00a3300bn in its reserves, European dependency on Russian energy, and wider dependency on Russian co-operation in issues like Iran and the Middle East, Russia is already well-armed with the weapons needed to fight this war. </p> <p>While many analysts have taken the Kagan/Krastev line, others are sceptical of describing the new era solely in terms of a competition between the democracies and the autocracies. Clifford Gaddy of the Brookings Institution, who has met both Putin and George Bush on several occasions, believes that Georgia is a 'turning point' but is more cautious about apportioning the blame entirely on Putin and his vision of Russia.</p> <p>'The Georgia crisis is not unique in itself. It has simply been the event that wakes people up to what has been already happening. I really think that many leaders in the West failed to acknowledge what was happening. I liken it to a financial bubble, and the implicit assumption was that Russia was weak. We considered multiple models for Russia, except for the outcome where Russia became strong and \"bad\" as defined in our terms of 'good' - which means \"like us\". No one considered this outcome because no one imagined oil at over $100 a barrel.'</p> <p>Gaddy also rejects the idea that Russia is trying to re-establish an empire or bring back a Cold War similar in scope to the last. Instead, he sees the current crisis as the inevitable reaction to the experience of Putin and those closest to him over the question of Russia's 'security' during the 1990s - when Russia veered towards becoming a failed state. </p> <p>That concern, existential in Russian society, Gaddy believes was too easily discounted by the West as a rhetorical device of domestic politics: 'Russia in the 1990s was close to being a non-entity. Survival as a grand power was an issue.'</p> <p>Into this was interposed the issue of Nato expansion up to Russia's very borders, sold first by President Bill Clinton and then George Bush, as a mechanism for 'democratisation' that would guarantee security. Gaddy says: 'That push was counter-productive and largely responsible for what is happening today. If we push harder, [as Gordon Brown suggests] it will confirm Russia's worst fear over what Nato is about. That is what I am afraid of - by pushing ever-harder we end up in a dangerous place.'</p> <p>The feeling that the world stands in the midst of a definitive reorganisation is shared in Russia. 'We are on the verge of a new Cold War,' argues Sergei Karaganov, a former adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and now deputy director of the European Studies Institute in Moscow. 'It seems like a Cold War. I can only hope it will not be so deep.'</p> <p>For Karaganov, the conflict between Russia and the West has been an inevitable consequence of a scenario that many American writers have recently turned their attention to - the relative decline in US power and the unipolar world that dominated throughout the 1990s - and the emergence of a multipolar world that US and British foreign policy has been slow to react to and acknowledge. </p> <p>It is not just that the West and the EU has been losing infuence because of mistakes made in places like Iraq, says Karaganov. 'Russia has contributed to what is happening, too, by being too cocky in trying to restore its position in the world too quickly. Not so long ago we were almost a failed state. Now we are one of the world's three big powers again.'</p> <p>There will be much noise generated by tomorrow's meeting in Brussels, the likely outcome is an agreement on a series of minor punishments - not enough to reverse what has happened in Georgia, but enough, it is hoped, to discourage Russia in the future. </p> <p>Among them, it is expected, will be a review of joint Russian-EU partnership agreements; a declaration of support for Georgia's territorial integrity (if not necessarily its President Mikheil Saakashvili, who launched the attack that led to Russia's intervention); and consideration of new visa restrictions for Russians wanting to come into the Schengen Area.</p> <p>What none will be able to ignore, in a grouping that gets almost a quarter of its energy from Russia, is that the EU - like the US - has few weapons in its armoury to punish Russia, except by attempting to shame it at a time when Moscow appears determined not to be embarrassed, its President, Dmitry Medvedev, declaring the country is not afraid of a 'new Cold War'.</p> <p>There are a few unwilling to be drawn into comparisons with the last Cold War. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carter, now a lecturer in US foreign policy, believes the solution to the crisis lies in old-fashioned capitalist economics, an influence notably absent in the days of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>'It is serious, but it is neither fatal nor tragic. It is serious because Russia is going through a post-imperial crisis of leadership inspired by post-imperial nostalgia. It is not tragic or fatal, because Russia is not the Soviet Union. It is vulnerable, as the flight of capital from its stock market has already shown. </p> <p>'The difference between Stalin and Putin is that Stalin commited great crimes on a great scale. Putin has committed petty crimes on a petty scale. And what is certain is that Russia's new business elite is not going to be happy if they think their bank accounts could be frozen or their children cannot study in the West. What is required is calm, deliberate ostracism.'</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of people are scrambling to evacuate New Orleans this weekend as the city braces for its worst hurricane since Katrina struck with devastating force three years ago. </p> <p>The ferocious winds of Hurricane Gustav will test official promises to learn from the fiasco of 2005, when images of people left helpless as their city drowned were seen as a shaming episode in George Bush's presidency. </p> <p>At dawn yesterday long queues of traffic rolled out of New Orleans - cars stacked with clothes, boxes and bags - while inbound lanes sat empty. Hospitals began moving patients farther inland as forecasters said Gustav was gaining strength and hurtling towards America's Gulf coast. </p> <p>Police with bullhorns were set to go from street to street to warn residents and tourists that there will be no government shelters in New Orleans itself. The doors to the Louisiana Superdome, where many sought refuge last time, will be locked as officials gamble that they can get people on to buses and trains in time. </p> <p>Those among New Orleans' estimated 340,000 residents who ignore orders to leave must accept 'all responsibility for themselves and their loved ones', the city's emergency director, Jerry Sneed, has said. </p> <p>Gustav was yesterday upgraded to a category 3 storm, with winds near 115mph, and forecasters warned that it could rise to category 5, the same as Katrina. To add to the concern, tropical storm Hanna is also gaining in strength, and expected to follow in Gustav's wake. Bush has declared a state of emergency in Louisiana and Texas. Gustav has already struck the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, killing 81 people. Cuban civil defence forces have been put on alert, and a mass evacuation is under way in low-lying coastal areas, where mudslides and floods are feared. </p> <p>The hurricane was expected to move over western Cuba late yesterday and into the southern Gulf of Mexico early today. It is projected to hit west of New Orleans early on Tuesday. </p> <p>Officials say work has been continuing every day over the past three years to improve protective levees that were breached by Katrina. The devastation exposed deep poverty, racial tensions and federal incompetence as thousands of people were left stranded without aid. Katrina left about 1,500 dead on the Gulf coast, and an $80bn bill to repair the damage made it the costliest natural disaster in US history. </p> <p>In 2005, as many as 30,000 people who could not or would not evacuate crammed into the Louisiana Superdome and the riverfront convention centre. They spent days waiting for rescue in squalid conditions and some died. Stung by the images that flashed across the world, including the photo of an elderly woman dead in her wheelchair, officials promised that it would never happen again. </p> <p>This time, Louisiana has a $7m contract to provide 700 buses to evacuate the elderly, the sick and anyone without transport. Officials also plan to announce a curfew that will mean the arrest of anyone on the streets after a mandatory evacuation order goes out. Police and National Guards will patrol after the storm's arrival, and Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has requested additional search-and-rescue teams.</p> <p>Yesterday police were due to tour neighbourhoods, directing residents who are in need to pick-up points. The city has also planned to enlist churches to help tell people where the buses will pick up evacuees. </p> <p>But campaigners warned that official advice might not reach day labourers, homeless people and other marginalised groups. Saket Soni, director of the New Orleans Workers' Centre for Racial Justice, said: 'Hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan, and they will be left in the city.'</p> <p>Elouise Williams, 68, called the hotline last Thursday until she was 'blue in the face'. She was worried about getting a ride to the pick-up point and about what would happen to those who left.</p>",
  "<p>Oh, people can be such snotbags when it comes to Wales. How they go on and on about the rain, how it's always raining. How the concept of the gastropub has yet to make the great leap westward. How, just as you've lost your way, on a hillside, in the rain, a farmer will appear and tell you to buggeroffmyfieldrightnow.</p> <p>But that's enough about me. At least, having grown up in Wales, I also know about the green greenness of its hills and the soft softness of its rain. (Being Welsh, I am impervious to rain; it simply beads at my neck and runs off my back.) Not to mention the strange wondrousness of the vowellessness of its towns: Ynysddu, Bwlchgwyn, Eglwyswrw - hello? are you still with me? - and my very favourites, the delightful Plwmp and the marvellous Mwnt. Repeat after me, Rhosllanerchrugog, Dwygyfylchi, Blaenllechau. And yet I still find myself making snarky metropolitan comments about the poor quality of the cappuccinos and complaining about the over-dependence of the public houses on scampi and chips.</p> <p>And then I find myself driving through the clouds above the Preseli mountains and down into a forgotten valley behind the sea in Aberaeron to a hotel called Ty Mawr where the dreamiest combination of roast hake, samphire and Penclawdd cockle sauce is waiting for me. By coincidence, I ate at Rick Stein's Seafood Restaurant in Padstow earlier this summer, and that was good. But this, cooked by Paul Owens, a Swansea boy, with all ingredients sourced within what seems like 500 yards of the house, is, I would say, even better.</p> <p>It turns out that I haven't been paying attention. Or that I've missed the signs. Or maybe I saw them (when I went to the pub in Little Haven, Pembrokeshire, earlier this year, it had turned into a boutique hotel, which is quite annoying, actually, when you're after a drink and it's been fully booked for weeks) and yet I still didn't put the pieces together.</p> <p>But something has happened. People keep on saying the C-word: Cornwall. And while there have been new gastro places creeping over the border from England for a while now, the Felin Fach near Brecon, and the Bell at Skenfrith, it's West Wales - an arc that takes in Cardigan Bay in the north down to Gower in the south - that has changed quite recently and quite suddenly; overnight it seems. </p> <p>The great perk, it turns out, of being a depressed rural economy, where the average GDP is less than 75 per cent of the European average, is that millions of pounds of EU money has been pumped into tourism in the last two years. Which, it turns out, buys an awful lot of fancy bath taps. </p> <p>But back to Ty Mawr. It's where Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller stayed last year when they were filming The Edge of Love and I've brought my poorly mum along for the ride - she has broken her shoulder - and the hotel feels like something that the doctor ordered: it's so friendly and comfortable, owned and run by Martin and Cath in an unpretentious way. Fifty yards down the road there is an organic farmshop and a couple of miles away on the coast in Aberaeron, there is the incredibly chic and stylish Harbourmaster Hotel and Restaurant and next door a new luxury B&amp;B, 3 Pen Cei.</p> <p>I have never been to Aberaeron before and the last time my mum came through was 25 years ago when 'it was all grey' but now it is a jumble of pastel-painted buildings around a tiny port. 3 Pen Cei is a model of how all B&amp;Bs should be - newly renovated, spotlessly clean and sprigs of lavender left on top of fluffy white towels in the limestone-tiled bathroom. </p> <p>And the Harbourmaster is, well, the sort of bar and restaurant that seems almost visionary for a small seaside town in the middle of mid Wales. There are huge copper lights above the bar, a stuffed albatross in a glass case (killed accidentally by the owner's grandfather while rounding Cape Horn), local art, wood-panelled walls, sofas, cushions made from woven Welsh blankets, and it's packed with what are mostly Welsh-speaking locals.</p> <p>Both the Harbourmaster and 3 Pen Cei have plaques on their walls saying they have been assisted, financially, by the Welsh Tourist Board, and they are textbook examples of how regeneration money can work. The Harbourmaster has put Aberaeron on the map, made it the perfect minibreak location with lovely old-fashioned New Quay (so much nicer than Cornwall's Newquay), quaint Llangrannog, and marvellous Mwnt just down the road.</p> <p>'It's where Rhodri has his caravan,' my mum tells me as we head for Mwnt, driving through the rain down a narrow lane to a huge wild cliff by the sea where a tiny, whitewashed chapel stands in the middle of a field. 'Rhodri?' I say. 'Rhodri Morgan, of course,' she says. The First Minister of Wales; there's a static van that's, apparently, the Welsh version of Chequers.</p> <p>I can see why he likes it though. At 6pm on Sunday, the bell is ringing and then, just audible over the rain and the wind and the waves on the beach and the seagulls circling overhead, there comes the strains of a hymn, sung in Welsh, floating out the door.</p> <p>I drop my mum in Cardiff, head off back up the M4, head back down, and then pick up my sister and we arrive at Llys Meddyg in Newport, Pembs (you always have to say Newport, Pembs, to distinguish it from the rather less lovely Newport, Gwent) just in time for dinner. I love Llys Meddyg right from the off. It has been boutiquified but in the best possible way. The rooms are stylish with huge baths but still manage to be super cosy with Welsh Melin Tregwynt blankets on the bed, and it is all so friendly and informal. Having locked Meg, the dog, in the car, we discover that she is welcome inside, the basement bar is packed, and Sian, my sister, immediately starts spotting former HTV news presenters from the Seventies. </p> <p>Scott Davis, the chef, worked in London and New York for 12 years for the likes of Gordon Ramsay and Jean-Jacques Rachou, and is a sort of Welsh Jamie Oliver, full of puppyish enthusiasm for unlikely root vegetables. 'Even five years ago, even two years ago, I wouldn't have been able to come back to Wales and work,' he says. 'But the restaurant scene has been utterly transformed. This place would have been unthinkable a few years back.'</p> <p>He has taken on a bunch of 16-year-olds from Carmarthen college and is training them up; after dinner they are in the bar, as is Ed, the owner, who comes from a local farming family, and his wife, Lou - and his sister, Lottie, and his mother, Cecilia, are somewhere around the place too. By 1am, the bar is still hopping, nobody is showing any sign of going to bed, and I take myself off to walk the dog and find that the pub next door is also rammed. Newport, Pembs, is jumping, I tell you.</p> <p>The next morning, I spot one of the trainees, bleary-eyed, who tells me how he got to bed at 3am, and then Scott who had gone to a party up in the mountains, thrown by 'some alternative lifestyle people' and had been up until 4am.</p> <p>There are a lot of hippies around Newport, he says. 'There's five families who live in mud huts up in the woods. You see them in the wholefood shop. They smell a bit, mind. But you get lovely vegetables off the hippies. Oh, they wouldn't let a fertiliser within a hundred miles of them. Beautiful, they are.'</p> <p>It is sad to say goodbye, although Cecilia cheers me up by recounting a scene she has just witnessed in the kitchen. 'Scott says to one of the boys, \"Does it say 'twat' on my forehead?\" And he walks up to him, studies his forehead, and then says, \"No Scott, it seems to have gone now.\"'</p> <p>We walk Meg on Newport's huge stretch of sand, Carningli, the mountain of angels, towering above it, and then meander down the coast, to sweet little Porthgain, and on to St David's, where it's all strange religious sects and wholefood shops and where Sian and I drive around and around the one-way system, squabbling as we go, and then it's on to the surfers' favourite, Newgale, where we are buffeted by the winds, and south to Bosherston, where in the dunes by the beach we stumble across a naked flasher. 'Shocking,' says Sian. 'On National Trust land.' </p> <p>Our very last stop is Laugharne, where Sian is entirely over-excited at the prospect of staying at Hurst House on the Marsh, having been there for a coffee a few months back and having practically bled from the eyeballs when presented with the bill.</p> <p>Laugharne, on the Taf estuary, is where Dylan Thomas wrote Under Milk Wood, the play for voices that depicts 24 hours in the life of a Welsh fishing village, Llareggub - Buggerall spelled backwards - based largely on Laugharne. There is a fantastic ruined castle, an idiosyncratic guesthouse and restaurant, The Cors, a new, slightly offbeat literary festival, and Cross House and Brown's Hotel where Thomas used to drink and still a sense of what he called 'the strangest town in Wales'.</p> <p>We drive through and on past some pebble-dashed bungalows, turn left at a caravan site and then on into the vast marshes next to the sea. It feels like the ends of the earth, and there, amid the sheep, is Hurst House. It is a converted farmhouse, an offshoot of Hurst House private members' club in London, and was co-owned by the actor Neil Morrissey and businessman Matt Roberts.</p> <p>We haven't escaped the headline on the front page of the Carmarthen Journal though which points out that the hotel went into administration this month and Neil Morrissey is no longer involved, although Roberts has found a new investor and bought the company back.</p> <p>To be honest, none of this is exactly surprising because the hotel is exquisite, gorgeous, beautifully done, with roaring log fires whichever way you look, and one-off glass ornaments, and bare stone walls, and wooden floors and antique vases and tables and a glamorous bar. Our rooms are opulent verging on the baroque. I don't really take too much notice of the taps in my bathroom until I spot them for sale in a shop in Narberth for \u00a3375 a pop. That's \u00a31,500 on bath taps in my bathroom, alone. We start referring to it as The Moneypit.</p> <p>But the food just doesn't quite match the decor. Dinner comes to well over \u00a3100 and Sian's bit of cod looks like it must have shrank in the wash. Still, it is amazing that it is here, a triumph of hope over marshland, and we enjoy chatting to Mr Jones of Carmarthen who turns out to be the frozen food mogul of mid-Wales.</p> <p>The weirdest thing happens though when I go to bed and turn on the TV to see if there is anything on. There is: Under Milk Wood, the hallucinatory 1972 film version is on BBC2 Wales with Richard Burton as the narrator, Peter O'Toole as Captain Cat, Sian Phillips as Mrs Ogmore-Pritchard, and sensationally, Liz Taylor, as Rosie Probert, her eyelids painted emerald green.</p> <p>It is the urtext of modern Welshdom, as marvellous and strange as Laugharne feels the next day when I walk across the marshes and climb Sir John's Hill with its views across the silent mudflats and the sandy expanses of Pendine all shrouded in mist.</p> <p>We peer inside the shed where Dylan wrote Under Milk Wood and his great and wonderful poem 'Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night' about his father dying. We visit The Boathouse which is now a rather understated museum and watch a film which recounts his last words, the best, surely, of anyone's anywhere: 'I've had 18 straight whiskies,' he said. 'I think that's a record.'</p> <p>Oh those Welsh men. We go to see his grave in the churchyard and note that his wife Caitlin outlived him by 40-odd years. Do not go gentle into that good night, Dylan. You didn't even heed your own words. Bloody typical, I think as we trudge back to the car. </p> <p>That's the thing, about Laugharne, about Wales, in the end, it can never just be about jaunty puffs for boutique hotels. There's always an edge. </p> <p>Cornwall, my elbow.</p> <h2>Glossary</h2> <p><strong> Can you tell me where I can buy some fresh organic milk, half a dozen free range eggs and a joint of hand-reared Welsh black beef please?</strong><br>Ble alla'i brynu llaeth ffres organig, hanner dwsin o wyau buarth a darn o gig eidion buwch ddu Gymreig os gwelwch yn dda?</p> <p><strong>Yes, I quite agree, you're right: AA Gill is a talentless schmuck who looks like a hobgoblin.</strong><br>Ie, rwy'n cytuno - chi'n iawn, mae AA Gill yn hen iolyn di-dalent sy'n edrych fel bwgan!</p> <p><strong>No, no, no!

  "<p>THE TWO women seemed like captured war trophies. Debra Bartoshevich and Cynthia Ruccia were both former supporters of Hillary Clinton's campaign. Now they were backing John McCain. In front of the TV cameras at a Republican press conference in Denver last week, they were introduced by Carly Fiorina, a top McCain aide and a possible vice-presidential choice before he settled on Alaska governor Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Both women were vociferous in their support of McCain and slammed Barack Obama for - in their opinion - abusing America's female vote. 'The [Democratic] party is allowing 51 per cent of the country to be bashed,' said Ruccia, a Clinton supporter and Democratic official from Ohio. Bartoshevich, once a Clinton delegate from Wisconsin, went even further. She is now the star of a Republican 'attack ad' appealing for Clinton supporters to abandon Obama. 'I have spoken to a lot of Democrats who are the same as I am. But they are not ready to come out,' she said. She added that she was going public to encourage them to jump ship too. 'I want others to feel that they can come out,' she said.</p> <p>That was music to the ears of Republican strategists and a worry for Democrats. Never before have women voters been so much the focus of concerted political attention. Clinton's sprawling, dramatic battle with Obama has put the female vote firmly in the headlines. By the end of the fight, Clinton had moulded herself into the unabashed champion of women, demanding that their voice be heard. Now Obama is scrambling to make sure those voters stay in his coalition. The surprise factor is that the Republicans have joined the chase and are aggressively pursuing the same target. McCain is heaping praise on Clinton and her achievements. Now he has picked a mother of five from Alaska as his running mate. Battle has been joined. The war for the women's vote could define the final two months of the election.</p> <p>In front of a cheering crowd in Dayton, Ohio, Palin herself left little doubt as to her role and intentions in the coming fight. In scenes unthinkable in a normal election year, the crowd witnessed the spectacle of the Republican vice-presidential choice lauding the achievements of Hillary Clinton. She praised Clinton's 'determination and grace' in her fight against Obama. The crowd seemed confused, with a few groans being muted by half-hearted cheers at Clinton's name.</p> <p>But Palin was not put off. She promptly stole one of Clinton's old stump speech lines. 'Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest ceilings in America,' she said. Palin then cast herself firmly in the light of women's rights, following on from the ground broken by Clinton and Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic pick for vice-president. 'It turns out the women of America aren't finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all,' she said.</p> <p>The pitch to bring in women on the McCain ticket was obvious. But it will be no easy task. Women in America are generally more sympathetic to a Democratic candidate. Recent polls have shown that six out of 10 women count themselves as Democrats or Democrat-leaning. In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, Obama attracted 55 per cent of the female support compared with McCain's 37 per cent. But Palin is not the only weapon in the Republican armoury. Figures like Fiorina - a former top businesswoman - have been increasingly visible in recent weeks. Then there is Cindy McCain, John McCain's wife and the potential next First Lady of America. With her demure attitude and blonde good looks, Cindy is wildly popular with traditional Republicans, superb at chatting to supporters in diners and coffee shops. 'She is a wonderful campaigner. People react to her,' said one Republican aide.</p> <p>It makes a contrast to her opposite number, Michelle Obama. A black lawyer with working class roots, she is from a world far removed from Cindy McCain's wealthy childhood in Arizona. Michelle is also at ease giving speeches but has a frank and fiery style. She is in many ways the archetype of the aspirational professional married woman and is a powerful draw to female voters.</p> <p>There is another side to Cindy McCain, one that reflects decades of travel to war-torn spots around the globe as part of her medical charity work. Recently, as her husband took a hawkish line on the Russian invasion of Georgia, it was his wife who popped up in a refugee camp in the aftermath of the country's short-lived war. 'My job in all of this is to make sure that the international community does not forget what is going on here,' she told reporters. Such comments did a lot to dispel the common notion of Republican First Ladies as 'Stepford Wives' adept only at lunches and buffets.</p> <p>Such developments pose a dilemma for the Obama camp. The campaign knows that it cannot afford to be complacent when it comes to female support. Palin in her speech steered clear of any ideological positions and instead touted her personal story as a mother of five. She called herself 'just your average hockey mom in Alaska' and emphasised her working-class background and that of her husband.</p> <p>But the Obama campaign has worked hard during the past week to shore up its support among women, especially the 18 million who backed Clinton. The effort was led by Clinton. She gave a speech in Denver attacking McCain and strongly supporting Obama. Much of the first three days of the convention was devoted to patching up publicly the divisions left over from the long nomination fight. A symbolic roll call included Clinton's name. It was stopped by Clinton herself, who then asked the convention to acclaim Obama the nominee. It was a powerful endorsement of his candidacy. Her husband, Bill Clinton, who has seemed lukewarm towards Obama, also made an impassioned plea for his election. Hillary then rejected recent Republican ads that have featured her criticising Obama.</p> <p>Certainly the former Hillary supporters promoted by the McCain campaign seemed to have trouble responding to policy questions about why they had switched sides. Ruccia, who confessed that she was pro-choice on abortion, is now supporting a Republican ticket on which both names are anti-abortionists. Bartoshevich is in the same position. 'I am not a one-topic voter. I take a look at other things,' she said. 'Things like the economy. I look at his [McCain's] experience in foreign policy.'</p> <p>That may be true. But to stop similar voters switching sides, the Obama camp believes that it will only have to emphasise Palin's red-blooded conservatism. Democratic strategists are betting that few women will be swayed by Palin once her opinions become widely known. She is a staunch opponent of abortion rights and a committed evangelical Christian. She is sympathetic to teaching creationist theories in schools. She is also a proponent of gun rights and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association. It is unlikely that seeing Palin blasting away with a machine gun will persuade too many Democratic women voters that she is a genuine kindred spirit.</p> <p>But Palin does owe Clinton a huge debt. Her nomination for vice-president is a product of the campaign Clinton ran and the nerve it touched among millions of women across America. Just as Obama's run for office energised black Americans and young voters, Clinton's historic efforts triggered a political awakening among many women. That is what McCain is hoping to tap into by choosing Palin and by taking advantage of Obama's decision to pass over Clinton for his own running mate.</p> <p>Clinton's run for the White House was full of ironies. She began as favourite but ended as a scrappy, passionate underdog. The ultimate party insider, she became the voice for a downtrodden generation of Democratic women. In the end she may still achieve her goal of putting a woman in the White House, albeit as vice-president not commander-in-chief. Yet that woman will not be Hillary Rodham Clinton. It could instead be a gun-toting former beauty queen. In an election already replete with surprises, no one could have predicted that.</p>",
  "<h2>Virgo</h2> <p><strong>23 August-22 September</strong></p> <p>Multi-tasking is all very well, but the message from last night's Virgo new Moon is not to scatter your energies. Self-discipline is key: finish what you've started, accept responsibility and play for the long term - autumn provides a rare opportunity to be architect of your own destiny. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Richard Gere, 31 August 1949</p> <h2>Libra</h2> <p><strong>23 September -23 Ocober</strong></p> <p>Last night's new Moon calls for a spot of inner communion and reckoning with the past. The trio of Mars, Mercury and Venus in your skies demands the prompt dispatch of business, with the 24th (when Mercury turns tail) as a deadline. Venus, your guardian planet, favours an image overhaul, bouts of shopping and largesse towards friends. </p> <h2>Scorpio</h2> <p><strong>24 October-21 November</strong></p> <p>Some people with whom you spend time - colleagues, say - are allocated rather than chosen, but at least make a decent job of rubbing along with them. Group involvements are September's special topic, a time to decide who shares your ideals and to ensure you're not hanging with the same old crowd out of laziness or misplaced duty. You want opportunity, not obligation. Romance? A hush hush job this week. </p> <h2>Sagittarius</h2> <p><strong>22 November-21 December</strong></p> <p>Yesterday's new Moon signals the renewal of your onward professional march. As you're operating under Saturn this autumn, patience, accountability and observing due protocol all come before cutting a dash for glory. Plain speaking (your forte) has to come with tactics, not just bravado. That said, it's a fine week for networking and, come Saturday, showboating. Romance? Oh yes. </p> <h2>Capricorn</h2> <p><strong>22 December-19 January</strong></p> <p>Full of good resolutions? Yesterday's new Moon gives you a green light to implement them, especially if you were born in early January. The long-term view is what you're after, and help from lifestyle gurus is to be welcomed. </p> <h2>Aquarius</h2> <p><strong>20 January-19 February</strong></p> <p>The 'romantic spirit' is your calling card for the next month, so strike out for majestic landscapes or get close to current crushes. Even hardy romantics can't live on air indefinitely, however; yesterday's new Moon asks you to get hard-nosed about money, especially deals with partners and exes.</p> <h2>Pisces</h2> <p><strong>20 February-20 March</strong></p> <p>Yesterday's new Moon offers a chance to wipe the slate clean with significant others and start over. A little formality will do no harm, especially if you are declaring a partnership null and void. Even if you are on an even keel with your other half, form-filling and forelock-tugging is a feature of the season. Single? The liaisons look attractively secretive.</p> <h2>Aries</h2> <p><strong>21 March-19 April</strong><br>Three planets in opposition make for a spicy mixture of passion and provocation over the coming weeks. Going head to head with rivals can be healthy and bracing, and romantic chases can be fun, but as this is a protracted story, ensure that terms and conditions with your intended/ex/business partner are clear at every stage. </p> <h2>Taurus</h2> <p><strong>20 April-20 May</strong></p> <p>The more you adopt a Virgo attitude the better - not the food fads and health quirks necessarily, but stripping away affectation and getting back to basics. At work and home, organise, clean and discard. Attend to tedious postponed tasks. Analyse problems systematically. When you're done being a paragon of virtue, you can slip back to being a gutsy, red-blooded Taurus, but work comes first.</p> <h2>Gemini</h2> <p><strong>21 May-20 June</strong></p> <p>2008 offers no better time than now to take a difficult, strategic decision - one involving your property or your family, maybe, or a change of tack in your career. It's a case of knowing where you belong and accountability - the buck stops with you. If you're in a groove, three planets in a fellow air sign promise to sweeten things and supply all the personal action you can handle.</p> <h2>Cancer</h2> <p><strong>21 June-22 July</strong></p> <p>Yesterday's new Moon makes this a good time to wipe the slate clean with siblings and friends with whom you are on less than splendid terms. It's a time for consolidation and counting your blessings, with teachers, sponsors and mentor figures looming helpfully over the coming weeks. Practical chores are best done now - the equinox (on the 23rd) strews banana skins in your path.</p> <h2>Leo</h2> <p><strong>23 July-22 August</strong></p> <p>Feeling royally flush? Yesterday's new Moon emphasises that there are no fiscal problems you can't solve with a bit of belt-tightening, while Saturn insists you don't turn away. Planets elsewhere represent a wild card in your favour when cavorting around town, networking and trading. Best not play too fast and loose, however - you'll be held to your word.</p>",
  "<p>Letter writing has disappeared so completely from many people's lives that we now romanticise the practice. Not everyone who wrote enough letters to yield a large book, like this one (which includes only about half of what survives from Dirk Bogarde's output), had a great deal to say. The form need not be a minor one and plenty of letters reach print which are miracles of breadth or colour - condors and macaws - but most letters have always been pigeons, even crows.</p> <p>John Coldstream, the editor of Ever, Dirk, sees the book as completing a 'quartet' in different media, made up of an Arena documentary first broadcast in 2001, Coldstream's authorised biography and an archival website, but it's hard to see how it qualifies as necessary or even desirable. Any biographically important letters have already been quoted by Coldstream (and aren't reprinted here). </p> <p>As a witness, Bogarde was amazingly unreliable: it's easy enough to give the wrong date for your parents' marriage, more of a challenge to get the number of your own siblings wrong (by two). John Coldstream corrects many errors of fact, but in the case of a 1991 letter to Philip Hoare, who was researching a biography of No\u00ebl Coward, he simply adds a footnote: 'A knowledgeable insider says, \"There is more romance in this letter than in Peter Pan.\"' </p> <p>Bogarde wasn't a self-revealing correspondent in any orthodox sense. He exchanged letters with Penelope Mortimer from 1971 (and, unusually, thought highly enough of her side of the correspondence to keep and bequeath it), but in 1991 wrote, in answer to an emotionally challenging letter: 'You DONT [sic] know me', with a kind of pride.</p> <p>The earliest letter printed here is from 1969, when Bogarde had already been established as an actor for a couple of decades and had started working with Visconti. In that year, he and Anthony Forwood, his business manager and life partner, moved to Europe (first Italy, then the South of France). Letters to an earlier partner, Jack Jones, dating from the Forties and Fifties, were destroyed at Bogarde's request, though Jones got back in touch in 1975. The editor describes Bogarde's replies to Jones as emitting 'the unmistakable sound of Dirk's teeth being gritted and ground while he responds as cordially as possible to someone who represented a period in his life when he both wanted and, because of his subsequent, almost immediate celebrity, needed to bury.'</p> <p>That applies reasonably well to the first letter reprinted here, but not to the second, from 1980. I hereby give notice that if I ever mention, in a letter to an old flame, that I can still get into a pair of breeches I had made for me 40 years previously, and that they still hug my figure ('Tight then, and tight today'), I am not doing the opposite of flirting.</p> <p>In the late Seventies, Dirk Bogarde began to make the transition from acting to writing (memoirs, but also novels). Coldstream heads his introduction with something Bogarde wrote to his first editor, Norah Smallwood: 'I am really not a bit happy unless I am writing. Even a letter will do.' The need to write, though, doesn't impose on a general public the need to read. Letters enabled Bogarde to establish relationships that were simultaneously intimate and distant, something that suited his temperament. </p> <p>The commonest feature of these letters is a strict instruction not to reply, which put this very rejection-minded man in a strong position. Either you wrote back, which showed that he was important to you, or you didn't, in which case you were only doing as he asked. The casualness was highly artificial, as became clear when a correspondent took it at face value (as he wrote to Penelope Mortimer in 1983: 'Who stopped first, answer me? You or I? I know. Yew [sic]').</p> <p>Dirk Bogarde's books were painstakingly shaped and rewritten. Writing letters functioned as a sort of five-finger exercise for him, but they were exercises mainly in the key of G: gush and grumble. The English moan is a complex phenomenon. Well-off expatriates moan about little things ('I refuse to pay five francs 50 for a small root of impatiens'; 'We cannot really afford to have [meat] more than once a week') because things are so nearly as they want them, or because they don't want to discuss their real worries, or for superstitious reasons. If you stop grumbling, the gods may suddenly notice how fortunate you are and take steps.</p> <p>Letter writing was part of Dirk Bogarde's life-support system, but what part, exactly? Perhaps it had a sort of renal function, clearing the blood of toxins. Many of these letters express the negatives of his virtues, such as a reflex of ungraciousness after generous hospitality, written when the washing-up was a stronger memory than the meal (which Forwood cooked anyway). 'A huge, really big, leek-pie, which Dick had two helpings of, TWO chocolate ice creams with nuts and cream walloped on top, half a round of cheese, lots of bread and butter, figs from the garden and TWO bananas from the greengrocer!' If that's what happens when you invite your dear neighbour Dickie Attenborough to dinner, either don't ask him again or don't expect leftovers next time. </p> <p>Another guest, the British consul's wife, may have thought she was making things easy for her host by drinking only hot water, but no ('A bit tiresome topping up her cup all afternoon ... ').</p> <p>Looking back on his correspondence with Dorothy Gordon, which he edited and published as A Particular Friendship, Bogarde said: 'The me of the letters is almost unbearably AWFUL! I can't believe that she was so diverted ... so adoring ... so amused. I thought He was poisonous!' Better to discharge the mild social poisons, though, than let them fester.</p> <p>It's true that you can assemble a sort of portrait of Dirk Bogarde from what's on offer here, but only a partial and diminished one. You could do something similar by trawling through his bins, recording the relative number of bottles - wine, whisky and water - or charting the way, in his solitary life after Forwood's death, soup tins gave way to Sloane Street sandwich wrappers and then to chicken bones when he learned to cook at last.</p> <p>In a way, it's all here, but none of what matters. 'Tits Jackson' abruptly becomes Glenda, 'magical to work with'. A denunciation to Norah Smallwood of Private Eye ('All grace, all decency, all honour is sacrificed'), which had carried a snide attack on her, omits the information that he was a shareholder in the magazine. The man who was brave enough to play the lead in Victim (1961), and was in a loving same-sex relationship for half a century, tells his 18-year-old niece in 1991 that he has recently been 'slammed as a homo' in Paris Match but that it is 'actually quite untrue'. His inadequacies are all on display here, but not what he brought to the screen, something made from the same materials but transformed by intelligence. Not his wounds, but his woundedness.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Madonna</strong> <br>Parc des Sport Charles Ehrmann, Nice </p> <p>Usually, the first few dates of a world tour staged by Michigan's biggest export since the automobile are rife with controversy. Last time around, for 2006's Confessions tour, Madonna hung herself from a glittering black cross. For 1990's Blond Ambition tour, it was simulated masturbation. Catholic authorities usually make banning noises when Madonna's visa request comes in.</p> <p>But this year's Sticky &amp; Sweet world tour feels different. Less sticky, perhaps, even though this is a hot French summer night, and the gig-goers of Nice scoff waffles and doughnuts. The outrage is minimal. Throughout the two hours of her show, watched by Nice's mayor and Elton John, she fakes one orgasm, kisses a female doppelganger on the lips, calls us motherfuckers and says: 'Mon fesse' (my arse) in ropey French. That's about it for fluids'n'sacrilege, two formerly key ingredients of a Madonna globetrot. The tour began in Cardiff last weekend not with a bang but with a grumble. She came on late. Tonight, the screens fail for a song and a half and a guitar is out of tune for a bit. No scandal here, just technical hitches, for which she politely apologises.</p> <p>Is it that Madonna, now 50, has finally grown up? Is it a newfound piety instilled by kabbalah? Perhaps. But after a quarter of a century of provocation, we are now probably unshockable. Madonna would have to fellate a donkey while dressed as the Pope to get cab drivers tutting now. </p> <p>No, the hoopla this time is merely political. Republican senator John McCain has objected to being part of a montage of world ills that obliquely aligns him with war, famine, pestilence and Nazi Germany, while his Democratic rival Barack Obama ends the sequence elided to Gandhi, John Lennon, ice cream and fluffy bunnies (well, not quite, but you get the idea). This is the 'Get Stupid' sequence of the gig, in which video projections of Madonna lecture us about imminent Armageddon, while the real, sinewy thing executes one of her umpteen costume changes elsewhere. Pop concerts are obviously not the best arena for nuanced political debate but, even by stadium standards, this is a point too crudely made. </p> <p>Moreover, Live Nation, Madonna's concert promoters, have issued a guide to Sticky &amp; Sweet, listing the quantity of freezers, trampolines and lipstick used on tour. While it's nice to learn of some gofer trawling eBay for vintage pantyhose for Mrs Ritchie and dancers (100 pairs), this litany of products, designers and equipment feels de trop. One fan here has T-shirt that reads: 'Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, jet priv\u00e9', a French philosophical discourse Madonna might readily subscribe to.</p> <p>Still, we do not come to Madonna for dignified austerity, and the Sticky &amp; Sweet tour delivers on visuals, pace and sheer physicality. Divided into four suites, each with its own theme, the show radically remixes old favourites and showcases the newer songs from her Hard Candy album. 'Candy Shop' and 'Beat Goes on' kick off with Madonna on a throne and in a retro convertible car, all soundtracked by some headily futuristic R&amp;B. Pharrell Williams, Timbaland, Kanye West (and, later, Justin Timberlake and Britney) all do their guest bits on giant video screens while Madonna and troupe contort below. </p> <p>In the absence of stickiness, perhaps the sweetest segment of the night is the homage to Eighties New York. 'Into the Groove' is reinvented in a blizzard of hip hop scratching while Madonna skips between two ropes, double-Dutch style. On the screens, Keith Haring visuals mirror the skipping below. In his memoir, Madonna's brother Christopher Ciccone accuses his sister of forgetting her gay roots since marrying Guy Ritchie, whom he portrays as a casual homophobe. So it is nice to see Haring's work onstage and the loyal gangs of gay men, lesbians and transsexuals out in support tonight.</p> <p>Less successful is the Gypsy interlude, where Madonna follows her infatuation with New York gypsy punk band Gogol Bordello to its logical conclusion. 'La Isla Bonita' is transported many miles to the east, with Madonna gripping a rose in her teeth and galumphing alongside Romany musicians and dancers.</p> <p>To be fair, she becomes more respectful, taking a break from centre-stage to watch them perform 'Doli Doli', a Romanian folk song. But it all ends with 'You Must Love Me', Madonna playing guitar on a stool and laboriously enunciating the Evita number. It is ghastly. </p> <p>Indeed, whenever Madonna picks up a guitar - which is often - the songs wilt a little. As the loveliness of 'Ray of Light' disappears under the groans of Madonna's axe, she increasingly recalls Courtney Love, who was, for a time, grunge's Madonna. Of course, she can't be all-disco, all the time, but Madonna is always at her finest singing about dancing while doing just that. So 'Give it to Me' - with its added cheesy rave stabs - brings the fourth quarter to a euphoric end. The body is where Madonna's true genius lies; all the head stuff is just a distraction.</p>",
  "<p>Is it too late to save Eric Pickles from himself? By rights, the popular architect of the Tory victory in Crewe and Nantwich should not have much longer to wait before he becomes chairman of his party, replacing Caroline Spelman (victim of unfortunate mix-up involving public money and her children's nanny). When they were invited to pick a fantasy chairman to preside over the party conference, visitors to the Conservative Home website recently offered Pickles their overwhelming support, with 52 per cent of the vote.</p> <p>What possessed them? Although the poll was held a few weeks before shadow health spokesman Andrew Lansley declared that fat people have no excuses for their behaviour, that does not exonerate the Pickleites, who must already have been well aware of David Cameron's engagement with fat politics, from his concerns about chocolate oranges and undisguised disgust for those who eat too many of them. </p> <p>'We talk too much about people being \"at risk of obesity\" instead of talking about people who eat too much and take too little exercise,' he said, in his celebrated attack on moral failure in the broken (except for Boris Johnson's bit) society. </p> <p>So the time has long passed since Pickles could claim that he is just big-boned. Did his supporters not consider, in their enthusiasm, what message the choice of an obese-looking party chairman would send out to fat people who must learn, as Lansley re-emphasised, last week, that 'the buck stops with them. They can't shuffle off the responsibility'? </p> <p>Although his party has not, as yet, completed the downloadable table which will tell us, at a glance, the body mass index of every sitting Tory MP, it must be clear, even to non-dieticians, that Pickles's figure betrays him as exactly the type of person whose slack, self-deluding, ultimately irresponsible behaviour must cease, before the country is flattened by their collective weight. </p> <p>'Changing our culture is not easy or quick,' Cameron warned. 'You cannot do it top-down. But you can give a lead.' The wonder is that Pickles has not followed it already. But conference is still four weeks away. That leaves ample time, on the No Excuses diet, for him to rediscover his bikini body.</p> <p>Week One. Goal: re-education. This is when Pickles should completely undress and take a good, hard look at himself in the mirror. How did he get here? It's not good enough to blame lack of tone on the influence of obese friends and colleagues, such as Nicholas Soames or Lord Strathclyde. 'Peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour,' says top dietician Lansley, 'and they are classic excuses.'</p> <p>Week Two. Goal: healthy eating. And where better to find nutritious inspiration than in the fantastic Unilever range of products? In his No Excuses speech, Lansley announced that Dave Lewis, chairman of Unilever UK, is to chair the Tories' new 'Responsibility Deal' on public health. </p> <p>For breakfast, Dave, who graduated in something or other from Trent Polytechnic, recommends a yummy Magnum, as advertised by slender Hollywood actress Eva Longoria. 'Did you know,' he says, 'that, eaten sensibly, ice cream can be part of a healthy balanced diet?' Yet another reason, as the food industry has been arguing, to abandon the stigmatising traffic light labelling system. Isn't it much fairer on ice cream to stigmatise people instead? </p> <p>Lunch: Eric should choose from Unilever's range of tasty Pot Noodles; just one will supply around 25 per cent of his daily recommended sodium allowance! His light evening meal could be anything from the Unilever list, from a delicious bowlful of Hellman's mayonnaise to a comforting cup of Bovril (assuming the source of the recent salmonella outbreak has now been identified). </p> <p>Week Three. Goal: enjoy exercise! Eric will find out how fun and exciting this can be if he tunes into CBeebies' LazyTown, featuring the Tories' favourite keep-fit instructor, Sportacus. This character is mentioned so often in connection with Tory health plans that you might easily get the impression that Sportacus, Cameron and Lansley are collaborators. But that would mean helping fat people, and as Sportacus creator Magnus Scheving says: 'LazyTown does not align itself with political parties.' </p> <p>Week Four. Goal: developing self-esteem. By now, Eric will be admiring his new curves and wondering how he could ever have fallen for the line, promulgated by the authors of last year's Foresight survey, that the UK's adiposity explosion is related to conditions in the 'obesogenic society'. </p> <p>A top priority in Lansley's No Excuses programme is to keep the public away from that kind of damaging misinformation. 'Tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity,' he warns, 'and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid: an excuse.' So even if Pickles already knows about the dire consequences of dietary abundance, human biology and a sedentary lifestyle, please don't mention this to any other Tory MPs who might use it as an excuse not to shed pounds of unattractive flab.</p> <p>It's hard to judge, at this early stage, how the Cameron anti-fat campaign compares, in hostage-to-fortune terms, with John Major's back to basics. Even supposing there are fewer extremely fat Tories than priapic and/or corrupt ones, there could still be morale implications for his plumper backbenchers, struggling for survival in the party of the thin. How long before some sobbing junior minister describes the horror of the constant weighing and hurtful criticism from party whips? At least fashion's size zeros get to be supermodels. </p> <p>Far riskier, however, is the possible impact of insulting one quarter - the obese section - of the adult population. Last week's map of obesity 'hot spots' suggests that not all of these potentially offended people are the deprived inhabitants of guaranteed Labour seats (supposing such places still exist). There are quite a few inexcusably obese people, it turns out, in Tory seats like Kensington and Chelsea. And, as much as the careers of Gillian McKeith and Anne Diamond reveal a surprising tolerance, on the public's part, for dietary advisers who may be unqualified, unhinged or five stone overweight, it seems to draw the line at abuse. </p> <p>Jamie Oliver is unlikely, ever, to regain the popularity he enjoyed before he put on a fat suit and advertised his moral superiority over the 'fucking arseholes' and 'tossers' who feed their children badly. And Oliver, at least, offered recipes with this analysis. The Tories' intentionally arm's-length initiatives amount to Cameron's rebukes, Lansley's 'no excuses', the promotion of Unilever's Mr Pot Noodle, and an end to traffic light food labelling. </p> <p>Of course, while obese people remain a minority, their demonisation might turn out to be a terrific vote winner. Easy to spot and fun to tease, they are also the perfect guinea pigs for Cameron's new, bottom-up approach to governance. It might just work. And if it doesn't, there's a perfectly good excuse: it's the fat people's fault, with knobs on. That's something to think about, Eric Pickles.</p>",
  "<p>The science of demographic projection and the art of scaremongering enjoy a relationship akin to that of the sadist and masochist: first comes the threat, then the relish with which the punishment is anticipated. Thus forecasts of increasing population numbers are guaranteed to produce dystopian visions of social collapse.</p> <p>The godfather of apocalyptic demographics was the Rev Thomas Malthus, who famously proposed in the late 18th century that unchecked population growth would lead to starvation. Population, he said, was destined to increase exponentially in relation to food supply. In the event, Britain's population grew from a hungry eight million in Malthus's time to today's well-fed 61 million.</p> <p>The cleric's name long ago became a byword for catastrophic pessimism, but there have been plenty of other doomsayers who have followed in his arithmetically wayward wake. It could be said that a recent editorial in the British Medical Journal emerges from the same tradition. Last month, John Guillebaud, professor of family planning at University College London, called for a reduction in the UK birth rate to help combat global warming.</p> <p>The lesson to be drawn from Malthus, however, is that we should never underestimate the human capacity to misrepresent the future or our ability to deal with it when it does arrive.</p> <p>Nevertheless, if human ingenuity is boundless, the planet and, in particular, that small corner lying off the coast of north-west Europe, is not. There is a finite space in which to fit people. The UK, after all, is significantly smaller than France or Germany.</p> <p>Last week, the European Commission announced its most recent population predictions. Britain came top of the league with an estimated growth in the next 50 years of 16 million people. With a total of 77 million inhabitants, Britain is predicted to become the most populous country in Europe.</p> <p>To those who view the world through a purely economic prism, these figures are a cause for celebration. As the headline in the Guardian put it: 'Germany shrinks, France grows, but UK population booms', making it sound as if Team GB had added a further gold to its Beijing tally, this time in the reproduction event. The paper pointed out that the projected rise meant 'the UK has less to fear about any \"generational wars\" brought on by the \"demographic timebomb\" of ageing and shrinking populations where those in work cannot support the pension needs of retired citizens'.</p> <p>This has become the rationale for the policy of population expansion. To deal with greater life expectancy, runs the theory, we need to produce or, rather, import more people. But it's worth considering where this cycle will end. How, for example, will a population of 77 million deal with paying for the pensions of its retired citizens? Presumably by expanding to 100 million. Then what?</p> <p>Still, let's resist the Malthusian temptation to overdramatise the situation and assume that a larger population will not lead to a global warming crisis, that there won't be a shortage of food or shelter, or an increase in disease. Instead, we can frame the problem in more modest terms: will an increase of 16 million people improve the quality of our lives? Will life become more pleasurable, less anxious, more satisfying?</p> <p>It's impossible to know the future, but there's no excuse for ignoring the present and just now things feel a little cramped in Britain, especially in the south east. Roads are almost permanently clogged, public transport is a mess, schools and hospitals are full and the sense of friction, the tension of reduced personal space, is often palpable. Would these problems be alleviated with another 16 million, the majority of whom would settle in the south?</p> <p>Such is the draw of the south east that the Policy Exchange think-tank recently suggested that the inhabitants of cities such as Sunderland and Liverpool should move there. Neither is there a shortage of economic migrants from across the rest of the world who also view the south east as their destination point. The European Commission estimated that immigrants would account for 10 million of Britain's 16 million increase in numbers.</p> <p>And here we come to the main problem of discussing the benefits and drawbacks of population growth. Immigration is inextricably tied to the issue of race. To wonder if 10 million new migrants is a good thing is to stray into territory most notably occupied by racists. In fact, immigration has become a much more complex matter than race; it's not uncommon, as author Mike Phillips noted last week in these pages, to see black Londoners complaining about the presence of white Poles. None the less, it's a sensitive matter and that's one reason the immigration debate has been restricted to the more neutral ground of economics.</p> <p>Bodies such as the Institute for Public Policy Research maintain there is a net benefit for the economy and there seems little doubt that much of the dynamism of modern Britain is due to the impact of migrants. However, economic success is not the only guide to a nation's health.</p> <p>As one economic migrant, Nemanja Vidic, Manchester United's Serbian defender, observed of the British last week: 'They just don't have time to feel the joy of life. Through the week they all work so hard. They only talk to people at lunch break. Then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day.'</p> <p>The UK economy has modelled itself on the American version, in which GDP growth and population growth are inseparable. But Britain is not America. There is not a sense of unlimited space on these islands or such a such a strong notion of Darwinian individualism.</p> <p>So the consequences of an entrepreneurial culture based on endless supply of renewable labour are something the nation at large needs to consider and one of those consequences is a population of 77 million.</p> <p>There's nothing wrong with asking, in the spirit of free inquiry, whether that may not be just a little too much.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Nick Cohen is away</p>",
  "<p>In the early Eighties, when I was 14, I embellished my hair with streaks of peroxide, and spent every penny I could scrape together on synthesisers. There was the Gnat, a tiny instrument with a heat sensitive keyboard that played to itself in warm rooms. There was the Juno-6, the DX21 and, most tragically of all, the SH101, which you slung over your shoulder and played as if it was a guitar. Which it wasn't. All of these were bought on Denmark Street, London's famed Tin Pan Alley, where music publishers clustered in shabby offices, and potential rock stars loitered, awaiting discovery.</p> <p>At number 9 Denmark Street was the Giaconda Cafe, where David Bowie found his musicians and the Clash drank tea in downtime from being awfully cross about a lot of things. But those days are gone and now naturally enough the site has been reinvented as a restaurant called the Giaconda Dining Room. Remarkably though, in an age when restaurants seem to be getting more expensive rather than less, this is one location on Denmark Street that will not be separating me from my spare cash unnecessarily. It is what central London desperately needs: an intelligent place selling quality, unfussy food at a reasonable price. This is not as simple as it sounds. The problem is that food costs are rising much faster than inflation, which makes it a tricky proposition.</p> <p>The Roux-trained Australian chef Paul Merrony is attempting to make the sums add up by keeping things simple. The Giaconda pulls on a gastropub ethic, only without the gastropub. The tight, 30-seater space is basic and spartan: creamy coloured walls, dark-chocolate-painted woodwork and tables, a few bottles of wine on display. There are two whip-smart waitresses out front, a very small brigade out back and a menu - starters at \u00a36, mains at around \u00a310 - that is not frightened of the cheaper cuts. Naturally I indulged in them, with a pig's trotter dish to start followed by a tripe stew, which makes it sound like I donned clogs for the evening and went all Lancashire.</p> <p>The ingredients might be from north of the Wash, but the preparation was from south of the Seine. The trotter meat had been removed from the bone, stewed down to a sticky unctuousness and formed into a cake, then fried off to give it a crisp, irresistible crust. All of this was served on a sprightly dressed salad with a soft boiled egg. The tripe came in an Iberian-inspired stew of chorizo, smoked paprika and butter beans with whole cloves of braised garlic. It was slippery and rich and bursting with flavour. Another starter of marinated raw salmon came layered with slices of cucumber and fennel, and was the kind of thing humid summer evenings cry out for. Ditto slices of pink, thinly sliced veal on a radicchio and potato salad. The menu is full of these classic dishes, paying scant regard to geography save that it favours the robust end of the European tradition. So there is a pumpkin risotto and a shellfish bisque, fish cakes or crab omelette. There is roast chicken for two, steak tartare or an Italian pork sausage stew and a whole lot more besides. If, as a meat eater - there is nothing among the mains for vegetarians - you can't find something here to eat, then you and I will never be friends.</p> <p>Desserts are designed for ease of service: some softly stewed apples with caramelised walnuts mixed into a dollop of whipped cream, a cylinder of nougatine glace, all smooth ice cream and caramel crunch with some impeccable raspberries. There is Eton mess and tiramisu and chocolate truffle cake. So no, not exactly surprising, but each is executed with the requisite skill. Almost all the wines are under \u00a330, and as you <br>arrive they bring you a carafe of carbonated filtered tap water. </p> <p>You may in weeks to come see some of my so-called rivals also giving this place rave reviews. This will suggest that the Giaconda Dining Room is some exquisite gastro-palace. It isn't. It is a small, humble, perfectly positioned restaurant, doing what it does very well. And, as I say, we have very little of that in Britain today. Certainly it's one of the best ways to spend your money on Denmark Street. Unlike that ludicrous bloody synthesiser that thought it was a guitar.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A dark grey limousine pulls up at the Miami Beach bar. From the back door, a woman's slender leg emerges. But its owner has her entrance ruined when she plunges her white sandal-clad foot into a puddle. A male friend rushes to lend a hand. 'What is to be done about all the potholes in Angola?' she asks. 'Buy a 4x4,' comes the answer. 'Everyone else has.'</p> <p>With a heavy helping of rich man's logic, Angola is this week heading into its first elections for 16 years. The last elections, in 1992, led to a return to war. </p> <p>The parliamentary poll is a crucial test for this south west African country - hitherto associated with conflict and land mines - which is the world's fastest-growing economy. Luanda, remarkably, has overtaken Tokyo as the most expensive capital on the planet. In three years, the former Portuguese colony's oil output will match Kuwait's. Angola is China's single biggest oil supplier. And the supplies are not about to run out.</p> <p>But for ordinary Angolans - who between 1961 and 2002 endured successive wars - the boom remains elusive, although economic growth last year was estimated at 24 per cent. The population of 12 million languishes in the lower development indicators of life expectancy, education and wealth. The gap between rich and poor is a chasm: while the middle classes pay $20,000 a month rent for an unimpressive one-bedroom flat in central Luanda, millions live in shanty towns around the capital. Aid statistics show two thirds of the population are surviving on less than $2 per day.</p> <p>Unemployment is high - between 40 and 60 per cent - and infant mortality rates are among the worst in the world, with about a quarter of children dying before the age of five.</p> <p>Be patient, says the government, which has rolled out a propaganda machine aimed at securing a high turnout on Friday and as many votes as possible for the ruling party, the formerly Marxist, now born-again-capitalist Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA).</p> <p>Many are convinced by the party's calls for patience - especially among those who have got rich quick. They can be found drinking whiskies with ice made from mineral water in the nightspots of the capital's Ilha peninsula - Tamariz, Eden Club, Caf\u00e9 del Mar - and, of course, the Miami Beach. It is co-owned by millionaire businesswoman Isabel Dos Santos. She is the eldest daughter of 66-year-old President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Dos Santos, who has been in power since 1979. At the Marinha Casino, a local businessman sips a Coke as he waits his turn at the blackjack table.</p> <p>'Angola is going its own way,' he says. 'With its oil and diamonds, it does not need to listen to the development advice of the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. The government has taken out oil-backed loans from the Chinese and Brazilians and is paying them back through construction contracts.</p> <p>On the evening television news, the President is seen inaugurating successive infrastructure projects: sanitation works that will bring drinking water to 80 per cent of the population by 2012, a fleet of 150 new fishing vessels. Estate agent Diogo Rodrigues said property prices had risen by 100 per cent a year during the past three years.</p> <p>He said: 'Studio mezzanines that we pre-sold in March for $350,000 are now reselling at $550,000.

Angola, which has its own reserves of uranium, is also considering investing in nuclear power.</p> <p>After initial disdain, prompted by China's aggressive entry into Angola three years ago, European diplomats realised there was plenty of business for everyone. In interviews with journalists, some now heap praise on the MPLA's stated plan to achieve economic support for the poor through a trickle-down effect.</p> <p>Another was more sceptical: 'The idea of building roads, hospitals and schools is great. But you also need nurses and teachers and it is not clear where they are going to come from.'</p> <p>British businessman Tom Gowans, who has been in Angola for 15 years, argues that President dos Santos is presiding over an 'African solution to an African problem'. Gowans, who works for Aggreko, a Dumbarton company that leases electricity generators, said: 'Encourage investment and you end conflict. We have taken electricity to Cabinda - a region where there have been calls for independence. Now that the area has electricity, the investors are coming, there are jobs and there is cool beer in the fridge.'</p> <p>While European diplomats and foreign and local business leaders glow with enthusiasm at Angola's oil boom, academics, human rights activists and opposition politicians are more cautious. An economist, who asked not to named, said the government had 'sold Angola's soul to the Chinese who are building low-grade roads and structures that will disintegrate in five years'. </p> <p>He added that 80 per cent of Angola's earnings stem from oil: 'Far more needs to be done, urgently, to diversify income generation. The biggest worry is that the government has simply been doing all this building so as to win the elections.'</p> <p>Opposition politician Carlos Leitao said Friday's parliamentary elections - which are due to be followed by presidential elections next year - are likely to be marred by 'massive fraud'.</p> <p>'The MPLA wants to be the single party in charge,' he said.

  "<p>When exactly was the moment when a change of government first seemed inevitable? Was it a year ago, when George Osborne made his speech about inheritance tax and Gordon Brown packed away his election plans? Was it when Blair finally decided to give up on New Labour last May? Jesse Norman, the Conservative Party candidate for Hereford, would take it back further, to 29 June 2005 when David Cameron uttered these, not quite memorable, lines: 'We recognise that government doesn't have all the answers, and we instinctively assume the best in people. We trust people. We don't view society from above, like some national project to be managed, directed and monitored. We look at society from the bottom up. Individuals. Families. Communities. Voluntary organisations and faith groups. Businesses. All the complex wonder of a modern, diverse country. We do think there's such a thing as society, we just don't think it's the same thing as the state...'</p> <p>This was Cameron launching his bid to be Tory leader, and making Ken Clarke look old overnight. It was the moment, Norman suggests, when the public first appreciated that crucial possibility: that there might be an alternative. 'People won't change their mind if there is nothing to change it to.' </p> <p>Cameron's choice of venue to launch this speech was as symbolic in retrospect as what he was saying. He was talking at the think tank Policy Exchange, of which Norman was then executive director. Cameron and his team were keen students of the mythology of the rise of New Labour, and they believed that no party rebranding could be complete without an ideas engine to nurture policy and personnel. Blair had had the Institute for Public Policy Research and Demos; Cameron would have Policy Exchange, established three years earlier for that purpose by moderniser-in-chief Francis Maude. </p> <p>In the three years since Cameron's speech, as his star has risen so has that of Policy Exchange (despite the embarrassment of Newsnight's expos\u00e9 of its questionable research into radical Islam, and the recent report suggesting northern cities were doomed). Its staff has increased from 5 to 35, its budget, mostly donations from the City, has grown nearly tenfold. One of its founders, Nick Boles, has become head of policy for Cameron; its former chief researcher, James O'Shaughnessy, is now chief researcher at Tory central office; current director Anthony Browne has just been appointed head of policy for Boris Johnson in London. </p> <p>When Policy Exchange was awarded Prospect magazine's think tank of the year award, a year after Cameron spoke, it was commended for its 'zip' and 'high impact'. Ed Balls MP, then still Economic Secretary at Gordon Brown's Treasury, presented the prize, noting that excellent think tanks were a necessary condition for parties hoping to take power, but, he hoped, not a sufficient one. By the time of this year's Policy Exchange summer party, attended by the entire Cameron court, and a good proportion of New Labour's old entourage, there was a glister of a movement that believed it was winning the argument. The only question that remained was what exactly its argument was. </p> <p>With this in mind, and conference season approaching, I spent the last week asking think tanks if they knew what Cameron was thinking, and what they thought he should be thinking. The most quoted line at the time of that inaugural speech was, 'we do think there is such a thing as society', but in hindsight the first line, Jesse Norman suggests, was as crucial: 'We don't have all the answers'. </p> <p>'I think Cameron is brave to stand up and say he is still coming to a view on certain questions,' Norman argues. 'It takes balls to say, \"We know there is something out there and we don't know what it is yet, but we are finding our way towards it.\"' </p> <p>It's a cop out, too, though, isn't it?</p> <p>'You have to draw a distinction between ideas and a viewpoint,' Norman suggests. 'Ideas come and go, what really matters is an intellectually distinctive viewpoint.' </p> <p>Does Cameron have a new viewpoint in his view?</p> <p>'He has set out the ley lines of a new viewpoint.'</p> <p>Some of Cameron's ley-lined viewpoint is contained in a book Jesse Norman wrote entitled Compassionate Conservatism, published by Policy Exchange. 'The beautiful thing was these ideas we'd been discussing for a long time were suddenly what was required,' Norman says. 'The same thing is about to happen in economics.' He has another book coming out, explaining that. </p> <p>Called? </p> <p>'Compassionate Economics.'</p> <p>Of course. How compassionate, exactly?</p> <p>'Conservatives are currently in the business of replacing the state-versus-individual dichotomy. The new relationship is more like state-versus-individual and many other institutions. Those institutions will be at the core of how we relate to each other on a local level...'</p> <p>Isn't that what New Labour used to call community?</p> <p>'Community is such a loaded term...'</p> <p>And isn't 'compassionate conservatism' a rephrasing of the fabled third way?</p> <p>'The third way is such an empty phrase...'</p> <p>I wonder if Norman sees Policy Exchange as a networking agency as well as an ideas forum. 'I don't see anything that could be described as a \"set\",' he says. 'Just a number of people with a shared viewpoint.' A bunch of people, you might say, in search of a big idea.</p> <p>Just before Beijing I was sitting watching Boris Johnson give a speech to the CBI about the London Olympics. Boris opened with typical blunderbuss bravado. Who, he asked, did they think his political hero was? The CBI, not the most volatile of crowds, sat silent. 'Come on!' roared Boris, with half a smile. 'Who do you think?' There were murmurs of Margaret Thatcher and Genghis Khan. 'I'll tell you,' said Boris eventually. His hero was the mayor in the film Jaws. When the town's population was being eaten by a shark the people rushed to the mayor and asked what he was going to do. What was his policy? The mayor answered that he had no policy, that he was going to do nothing, he was going to leave it to them to sort it out. 'A hero!' Boris declared in triumph.</p> <p>There is something seductive in your big idea being to let others have ideas. It is, as Cameron (and Boris) are keen to suggest, the perfect antidote to the top-down nanny state. The astute Anthony Browne, formerly of The Observer, and the man now charged with concocting Boris's policy of as little policy as possible, is still in his office in Policy Exchange until a successor is appointed. Why has his think tank become so close to Cameron? It's partly, Browne suggests, because in opposition 'they don't have half a million civil servants - or however many it now is - doing their thinking for them'. But despite appearances to the contrary, he insists, Policy Exchange is not a revolving door to Central Office. It also has strong relationships and influence with the government and Nick Clegg's Liberals. </p> <p>'What is extraordinary,' Browne suggests of the current moment, 'is that on a huge range of policy issues there is a great deal of consensus: the big state has run its course; everyone except the old hard left believes you need to introduce more choice and competition into the public sector. The question is how you achieve that.'</p> <p>When I suggest that Cameron (and Boris) are making a virtue of not having defined ideas, but rather having moods and attitudes, Browne says, 'The funny thing is the Conservatives actually have a lot of new policy.' Though when he runs through those new policies - welfare to work, more choice in education, and so on - they have a familiar ring.</p> <p>Over the summer much was made of Cameron's embracing of the idea of Nudge, the readable, much hyped book by the Chicago economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstran, that suggests that rather than being told to behave better by politicians it is more effective to 'nudge' (or trick) people into doing so. Thus rather than having an opt-in organ donor card and a big education campaign, it is far more useful to have an opt-out system and rely on people's inertia. This kind of anecdotal marriage of psychology and economics loads the dice in favour of civic virtue without legislating for it. A 'real third way' as its authors inevitably claimed.</p> <p>Will Browne be proposing that Londoners are nudged? </p> <p>'It is certainly fashionable,' he says. 'And it is important to use every tool in the box.'</p> <p>The Fabian Society historically stands for a lot of the possibilities of the planned economy that Policy Exchange derides. Its current director, Sunder Katwala, speaks to me on the phone while exploring a personal version of work-life balance by trying to control his one-year old on his lap. Does he believe that nudging rather than dictating is the way forward? </p> <p>'I think the social responsibility argument that Cameron uses [it's not the government's fault if you are fat] is a clever way of limiting expectations. It allows you to say, two years into office: \"Well, we the government are a little disappointed in you the people.\" You might well want to make a virtue of doing as little as possible in government - Harold Macmillan going to read Jane Austen in the garden of No 10 - but it is also a political reality that if ever anything bad happens then the public demands that the government does something about it. It may be not quite enough to say, \"Well, it's not really our role.\"'</p> <p>What can think tanks contribute? </p> <p>'Public narrative and arguments that link together ideas.'</p> <p>Most good ideas, the American novelist Nicholson Baker once observed, have about the size and complexity of a wheelbarrow. Take the idea of fairness. We probably come to an understanding of what it means at roughly the same age as we understand how a wheelbarrow operates. As a result, fairness is a concept much loved of politicians intent on plain-speaking. Tony Blair, in 2003, when things started to go wrong, vowed to his cabinet that he would submit all of his policies to a 'fairness test'. George Osborne has spent the past week 'campaigning on fairness' making it a 'narrative'. Osborne chose to launch this notion in a speech not at Policy Exchange or the Adam Smith Institute, but at Demos, one of the iconic New Labour think tanks. At the other, the IPPR, Michael Gove, the shadow education secretary, was making claims to that other rather fashionably desired quality 'wellbeing' (expect a speech on that other think tank buzz word 'fraternity' to follow).</p> <p>Richard Reeves, biographer of JS Mill, and cogent theoriser of wellbeing, has just taken over as director of Demos. What does he think Osborne and Gove were up to? 'Well,' he says, 'it is getting harder to tell where a particular idea might be picked up. But let's be honest about this. It serves the Tories' purpose well to have George Osborne at Demos. They are signalling that they are open to ideas from all quarters.'</p> <p>And are they?</p> <p>'Cameron makes a virtue of being a non-ideological politician, all of which makes him as difficult to fathom as Blair. But there will come a point when he will have to answer, for example, how many post offices should we close? And then he could take the Thatcher line - let the market speak - or he might choose to pursue his arguments about social value...' </p> <p>Where the Tories are winning, Reeves believes, however, is in their attitude to ideas. 'On the Conservative side there is huge amount of intellectual energy. Whatever you think about the Nudge thesis the fact is that Thaler came over and the Tories invited him in. Labour just ignored him altogether. It used to be the case that the government policy unit would interrogate someone like that as a matter of course. If you talk to people in the Labour party about ideas for policy at the moment they will say, \"For God's sake, don't tell anyone about this,\" while the Tories don't really mind if their ideas get \"adopted\".' As Osborne suggested in his talk: 'The more that Labour gets started on this agenda, the less work we will have to do on it when we get in.'</p> <p>At Demos, there is perhaps a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about some of this. While the government is mired in its difficulties, the Tories are using think tanks as their playground just as Blair did while Major was embroiled with the 'bastards' within. In creating their 'new consensus' they are borrowing (or retrieving) many of the opposition's clothes. Geoff Mulgan, co-founder of Demos, can look on perhaps in satisfaction at the way the Tories are moving across tribal lines in their search for policy in the way that he encouraged Blair to do 15 years ago. Mulgan has now himself moved on from the pure 'blue-sky thinking' - fixed-term marriages, legalised drugs and the rest of the original Demos manifesto - that eventually led him all the way to the head of Downing Street's policy unit. He now runs the Young Foundation which he characterises as 'a \"do\" tank rather than a \"think\" tank.' It is, of course - this being Mulgan - the future. </p> <p>'There has been a shift in the way the world works,' he says, ever alert to the new new thing. 'The old think tank days of publishing pamphlets and hoping they will get into a party manifesto are no longer effective. At the Young Foundation we put things into practice. At the moment we have about 35 new organisations under way or starting up, ranging from new ways of providing elder care to new model schools - we are launching several possibilities in America, and in China. We are anti-hype. We tend to quote Harry Truman: \"It is amazing what you can achieve when you don't try to take the credit.\"'</p> <p>In this sense, he suggests, it is not quite so important for the public to find out what Cameron believes as it is for him to discover what works. 'And he gets that point - in the way that most of the commentariat don't, because they are stuck in the printed word.' </p> <p>David Green of the think tank Civitas has also made Mulgan's journey from theory into action. A veteran of both Seventies labour councils and the Eighties free-market Institute for Economic Affairs, Green says: 'We had been talking about it for 20 years, and we thought it was about time we got around to doing it.' Civitas has an experimental primary school and a 'boxing academy' for some of the most challenging teenagers in north London. </p> <p>'We have just had our first GCSE results in,' Green says. 'One got a C in maths and one got a D. In the great scheme of things this is not an outrageous success story but we took the most demanding pupils out there, and we will improve our techniques based on what we now know.'</p> <p>Green believes that such experiments are in themselves the way forward for Cameron. He looks to Richard Reeves's idea of 'character' - set out recently in Prospect - which harks back to Baden-Powell among others, as one way to help restore what he calls the 'de-professionalised' society Labour has created, in which doctors, teachers and the police are able to take less personal responsibility. </p> <p>There was a time when the government's strategy unit under Geoff Mulgan, would invite the likes of Green in to say his piece. 'That hasn't happened lately. You can draw your own conclusion from that. It seems to me the government is trying to hunker down and defend what they have thought in the past. That is probably suicidal for a political party.'</p> <p>Cameron, meanwhile, in Green's experience, seems happy to borrow from anywhere. 'He seems to rather like a phrase I used many years ago: \"There is such a thing as society but it is different from the state...\"' Green says. </p> <p>Cameron may not have any answers himself but he might know a man who does. 'The solution to many of their problems is just that: experimentation and free inquiry,' Green says. But then, as a think tank director, he would say that wouldn't he?</p>",
  "<p>Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell faces damaging claims over its influence on a supposedly independent environmental audit to determine whether the world's biggest oil and gas project would receive vital bank funding.</p> <p>Dozens of emails released by the government under the Freedom of Information Act show how Shell officials in London attempted to downplay and edit international environmental criticism of the $22bn Sakhalin II energy scheme off the east coast of Russia, which has subsequently been all but fully financed. </p> <p>The exchange reveals anxiety from an unidentified party, thought to be a UK government agency, at how Shell was 'stage managing' the review conducted by AEA Technology, the one-time Atomic Energy Authority, now an environmental consultancy. </p> <p>The report, published last November, was used by banks to assess whether funding Sakhalin II was consistent with environmental and social protocols. </p> <p>Sakhalin II will produce 1.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide - three times the UK's annual carbon footprint. It also threatens the long-term future of the endangered western gray whale as well as rare fish and other wildlife. Shell owns a 27.5 per cent stake in the Sakhalin Energy project, with Russia's Gazprom holding just over 50 per cent.</p> <p>Email exchanges spanning three months and 40 pages show how officials at Shell sought to downplay the significance of a critical Russian environmental audit by persuading AEA to disperse its findings through the report, rather than leaving them in one potentially damning appendix. Questions from a leading environmental group over whether permits were sought before drilling work began were similarly downplayed, as were experts' concerns over the impacts of continuous noise on the critically endangered whale.</p> <p>That Shell, headed by Jeroen van der Veer, seemingly was allowed by the authority to amend the finished report has called into question the independence of the process, claim environmental campaigners. </p> <p>Doug Norlen, policy director of US-based Pacific Environment, said: 'The AEA report lists [Sakhalin Energy] as its client, even though it is meant to be independent. That's bad enough, but Shell stage-managed the whole process. They set the agenda, scheduled meetings and even participated in the editing of sections. I believe this to be a stark and vivid example of manipulation. In addition to skewing the review it destroys the pretence that banks have used ethical considerations before deciding whether to fund the project.'</p> <p>A spokesman for Shell said: 'The opportunity for Sakhalin Energy and its shareholders to provide comments on a draft report of this kind is routine and designed to ensure accuracy. The findings contained in AEA Technology's report are entirely theirs.'</p> <p>An AEA spokesman maintained the report was independent and while Shell and various banks made suggestions it was under no pressure to accept them. 'AEA maintained ownership of the report. In some cases it accepted suggestions and in others it rejected them. AEA stands by its final report in providing an accurate, balanced and independent view of the overall project.'</p> <p>Among banks which have lent Sakhalin II money is Credit Suisse, which advised Gazprom and Shell on the project. It declined to comment.</p> <p>However, the row has deeper significance. Shell is the oil major with the biggest interests in the Arctic. Earlier this year, it controversially spent more than $2bn acquiring drilling leases in Alaska's Chukchi Sea. It is also spending billions exploiting tar sands in Canada, a hugely energy-intensive process. Campaigners say Shell will use audits similar to that of Sakhalin to argue it is taking adequate steps to protect the environment. </p> <p>The 90 billion barrels of oil expected to exist in the Arctic are more than all the known reserves of Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Mexico combined.</p> <p>In recent years Shell has sought to soften its image after seeing its reputation trashed following the murder of Nigerian tribal leader Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was protesting at seeing his homeland damaged by Shell's oil extraction.</p> <p>The firm moved into renewables and placed great store by corporate social responsibility messages. But in the last year, it has seemingly changed tack, ditching renewable energy projects and aggressively bidding for licences in the Arctic, gambling that the world's thirst for oil will outweigh other concerns.</p>",
  "<p>My seven-year-old son slumped onto the heavily patterned carpet of Istanbul's Blue Mosque and looked up at me with a crumpled face. 'Mum, it's just a big empty room,' he moaned. I turned to his sister Emelye, nine, who, a little earlier, had seemed intrigued by the sound of the muezzins calling Muslims to prayer. 'Look at all the beautiful tiles on the walls,' I whispered. Em shrugged before collapsing onto the carpet next to Luke.</p> <p>Day two of our trip to Istanbul and things were not looking good. Over the road, inside the Hagia Sofia Museum, the children had played hide-and-seek around the giant columns for 10 minutes before pleading to leave. </p> <p>They had been eager to go to the Grand Bazaar, though probably because I had told them it was 'like the Arndale Centre, but older'. When they failed to find a Turkish branch of ToysRus in the ancient alleyways Luke wailed: 'This place is full of rubbish.' Only a refreshing glass of mint lemonade at the historic Fes Cafe and the sight of a man selling spinning tops for two lira (less than \u00a31 of his pocket money) cheered him up.</p> <p>A suggestion of a cruise along the Bosphorus had resulted in collapsed shoulders and cries of 'Boring!' though the children could have watched the men fishing from the Galata Bridge, next to where the boats depart, for hours.</p> <p>They enjoyed a trip to buy Turkish Delight at Haci Bekir, a shop close to the Spice Bazaar where the sweet was apparently invented - and bought boxes of the stuff for show-and-tell sessions at school - but really none of Istanbul's attractions could compete with the hotel swimming pool and the PlayStation thoughtfully provided by the super child-friendly Ritz-Carlton.</p> <p>Every time we left the hotel, the children nagged to go back, but thankfully it was close enough to the city's old European quarter, where all the main sights are huddled, for us to make brief excursions. But on the fourth day we gave up sightseeing altogether and went where all children long to go - the beach. </p> <p>Now you would be correct in thinking that Istanbul isn't known for its seaside resorts, but floating in the Sea of Marmara, a short scenic ferry-ride away, are the Princes' Islands where you find sandy coves and calm waters, ideal for little bathers. Known in Turkish as Adalar, these nine small islands - four of them inhabited - are popular with the Turks, but have gone largely unnoticed by international visitors. You certainly won't find them in holiday brochures.</p> <p>Ferries to the islands depart regularly from Kabatas which, as luck would have it, was just a short stroll from our hotel. We joined the hordes of mainly day-trippers on the 90-minute ride to Buyukada, the largest island, where we had booked a hotel for three nights.</p> <p>Had we only gone to Buyukada and back, it would have been a worthwhile excursion. Emelye and Luke jostled for a place at the ship's railing where they stood mesmerised for the entire journey. Buyukada, meaning Big Island, is the last stop, and every hour ferries spill passengers onto the jetty who head for the fish restaurants strung along the harbour, the ice-cream parlours on the street leading up to the main square or one of the many cycle hire shops.</p> <p>As no cars are allowed on Buyukada, or indeed any of the islands, we had no choice but to haul our luggage the short distance up the hill to the Splendid Palace, a grand twin-domed, red-shuttered affair. Built as a hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War, it is now one of the oldest hotels on the island. With cavernous rooms, dodgy plumbing and peeling paint, it still has the air of an infirmary but no matter - it has a lovely outdoor pool. Outside, horse-drawn cabs with red leather seats and fringed canopies wait to take passengers on tours of the island, which is just 4km long by a little more than a kilometre wide.</p> <p>Next morning, after breakfast on the hotel terrace (where we ignored the strong whiff of horse dung from the waiting carriages), we strolled down to the main square where we managed to cobble together a decent picnic, buying hunks of cold cheesy pasta from the bakery, grapes and apricots from the grocers and sticky baklava from the cake shop in the ferry terminal.</p> <p>On hired bikes (swapped next day for a couple of tandems; harder work for the grown-ups but more fun for the kids) we cycled west out of the only town along the only metalled road, which loops round the island in a loose figure of eight. We passed tall wooden mansions standing shoulder-to-shoulder, some grand and imposing with fragrant, manicured gardens, one or two so dilapidated I half expected to see Morticia Addams standing on the porch. </p> <p>With no cars to worry about, my only concern was the occasional horse-drawn carriage coming careering round a bend or the odd construction lorry rattling past, but as we moved further away from the town the traffic thinned and we let Luke race ahead while Emelye, who likes to go at her own pace, lagged some way behind, happily day-dreaming.</p> <p>Puffing uphill, we reached a cool picnic spot in a shady pine grove overlooking the still, blue sea, where horses wandered around freely, but we pressed on a little further to keep our promise and take the children to the beach. Yoruk Ali is a sandy cove and one of two pay-to-use beaches about a 15-minute bike ride from the town. In return for the \u00a35 entry fee you get a sun lounger and parasols.</p> <p>Utterly content, the children spent the day swimming in the icy water, collecting armfuls of seaweed and poking harmless small jellyfish while we lounged around undisturbed, stirring for the odd dip.</p> <p>Back in town in the evening, the last of the day-trippers had drained away and the streets were almost deserted. The only sound as we sat in a seafront restaurant mopping up meze with fresh bread were waves lapping the shore and the ha ha haaaa of the seagulls. The (many) dogs wandering the streets were silent. There was nothing for them to bark at.</p> <p>The Princes' Islands are so called because they once provided refuge for exiled emperors and empresses. Leon Trotsky also lived on Buyukada for four years from 1929 after being exiled from Russia. It was here he wrote his autobiography and his History of the Russian Revolution. After he left, he described it as 'an island of peace and forgetfulness'. Only slightly less tranquil now, I'd recommend anyone visiting Istanbul, with or without kids, to stay in Buyukada - or at least pop over for the day.</p> <h2>Is Turkey safe?</h2> <p>Turkey has long struggled with incidents such as last month's bombing in the Istanbul suburb of Gungoren that killed 17. That was the worst attack since 2003, when four bombs exploded in Istanbul, killing 60. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the 2003 blasts, but Turkey has also suffered at the hands of the PKK, a group which demands a separate country for the Kurds. In 2006, three explosions in Marmaris injured 10 Britons. Having said all that, the Foreign Office does not advise against travel to the country, merely suggesting visitors avoid political gatherings, are vigilant in cities and have full travel insurance. One survey this summer found Turkey had overtaken Spain as the most popular destination for Britons.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Easyjet (<a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">easyjet.com</a>) has twice daily flights from London Luton to Istanbul from around \u00a380 return.

  "<p>It's Monday lunchtime and Steff's Place is packed. A simple chrome kiosk with a brightly coloured menu opposite the luggage carousels in terminal three of Copenhagen's Kastrup airport, it's a local institution. The reason? As the Danish diaspora returns home, even before they pick up their suitcases their thoughts turn to one thing: hot dogs. </p> <p>The Danes are the world's most dedicated devourers of hot dogs with more than 50 different kinds of sausages available, from the humble r\u00f8de p\u00f8lser to the exotic-sounding kaempe knaek. Around 50 million sausages are produced for the fast-food market each year by leading Danish manufacturer Tulip, and Copenhagen is home to hundreds of p\u00f8lsevognen (sausage wagons), many manned round the clock for the quintessential Danish experience of a hot dog on the way home after a night on the Carlsberg. </p> <p>I'd come to the Danish capital to explore the national obsession with hot dogs and my first mouthful at Steff's Place piqued my appetite to know more. The simple hot dog of sausage, ketchup or mustard and fried onions, washed down with a cold local lager, tasted divine. Despite all the sleek eateries and stylish cafes that typify the burgeoning Danish gourmet scene, nothing could beat a dog at Steff's Place. </p> <p>That was, however, until May this year when the L\u00f8gismose Grill bar opened and had the cognoscenti positively drooling at the prospect of a place where man and sausage could live in perfect harmony. L\u00f8gismose is part of Nimb, a new boutique hotel and restaurant in the city's historic Tivoli Gardens - the first accommodation actually inside Tivoli since the gardens opened in 1843. With its 13 rooms, a fine-dining restaurant, in-house deli and the cellar-bar Vinotek for tapas and wine, it oozes effortless Danish style. </p> <p>So do the hot dogs. 'I got the idea from the p\u00f8lsevognen across the road outside the central train station. I wanted to make hot dogs that were pure and high quality,' says head chef, Thomas Herman, giving me a crash course in the art of preparing the perfect Danish hot dog. </p> <p>He insists the secret is to cook every-thing fresh on the grill. He has the smoked sausages specially prepared by a butcher in southern Jutland and the soft-dough brioche rolls prepared by a Japanese bakery. In a nod to the gastro-science of Heston Blumenthal, the onions are fried in duck fat and rosemary to add depth to the flavour, while the remoulade, the tartar-like sauce accompaniment, is prepared from a marinade of mushrooms and pickled vegetables. Hot dogs are traditionally washed down with chocolate milk, flavoured with vanilla, and Herman serves them with milk produced by the hotel's own organic dairy. </p> <p>I'm about to tuck in when Thomas, who plans to expand the brand into a chain of gourmet hot-dog grills around the country, calls for a moment's contemplation of our creation.</p> <p>'The perfect hot dog has three elements: the smoked flavour of the sausage, the sweetness of the sauces and the cinnamon-flavoured bread, and the sharpness of the onions,' he says.</p> <p>'We grow up with hot dogs in Denmark. I remember going ice-skating with my father and we would always grab a hot dog on the way home. Hot dogs taste of nostalgia.' </p> <p>After my class, I take a brisk pre-dinner constitutional around Tivoli with its mix of family-friendly attractions, gardens and 40-odd places to eat, ranging from organic frankfurters at Hot Dog Corner to The Paul, a Michelin-starred eatery run by British-born chef, Paul Cunningham. A ride on the Flying Carpet, named after the story by the city's most famous adopted son, Hans Christian Andersen, is the essential way to work up an appetite. </p> <p>Dinner that night is simple, home-cooked Danish fare - a piece of succulent beef, preceded by six oysters, at the hotel's Restaurant Nimb. Seated on a high chair, I have a view of the chefs at work to my left and a vista across the gardens, glazed by hazy, summer sunshine, to my right. </p> <p>But, before retiring to my room, I can't resist one last taste of hot-dog perfection. After a drink in the candlelit bar with its huge murals by the artist Cathrine Raben Davidsen, I sneak next door to the L\u00f8gismose Grill bar for one final bite. The bread is melt-in-the-mouth soft, the remoulade tantalisingly tangy and the sausage smoked to perfection. Steff's Place was good, but I have now joined the rarefied ranks of the hot-dog connoisseur - and found a little piece of hot-dog heaven. </p> <p>\u2022 SAS Scandinavian Airlines (<a href=\"http://www.flysas.com\">flysas.com</a>) flies to Copenhagen from Heathrow, London City, Birmingham, Manchester and Aberdeen from \u00a3118 return.

  "<p>There must have been red faces at the Hong Kong Jockey Club during the Olympics when the show jumping stage of the men's Modern Pentathlon became a muddy farce. </p> <p>Of the 36 riders who took part, all incurred penalty points and five failed to complete the course. British competitor Sam Weale went into the event in eleventh but despite putting in a round where his horse refused twice at the fourth obstacle he moved into third. The combination of rain-softened conditions, a raucous crowd in a cramped arena and fences too difficult to jump (they were lowered before the women's contest the next day) proved too much for the horses used - thoroughbreds loaned out by the HKJC whose names were changed for the day. The idea of each horse - drawn by lottery - being used twice during the event was quickly scrapped once it started to look as if some had never seen a fence before. </p> <p>Not that the HKJC can be accused of cutting. They spent US$150million on facilities for the visitors and the stables had air-conditioning, water dispensers, padded floors and walls to prevent injury and most intriguingly - play rooms. </p> <p><strong>Super Sundays in America</strong> </p> <p>Sundays are often billed as family fun days at British racecourses and the situation is the same at a number of American tracks - although the generosity of their offers puts their British counterparts to shame.</p> <p>With this being a Bank Holiday weekend in the US, today's Family Day at Ellis Park in Kentucky includes free admission to all and a $1 flat fee for hot dogs, draught beers, soft drinks, ice cream and popcorn. A band will perform after racing and all racegoers will receive a free duffel bag.</p> <p><strong>Putin's pal misses variety day</strong></p> <p>It was disappointing that Mourilyan could not take up his entry and make his British debut at Sandown yesterday, although the four-year-old's owner may not totally have fitted in among the various minor celebrities parading on Variety Club day at the Esher track. Mourilyan races for Ramzan Kadyrov, the colourful president of Chechnya. Kadyrov, whose close friends include Vladimir Putin, believes in polygamy and keeps a lion and a tiger as pets. He also has his own private army who have faced accusations of rape, torture and kidnapping from human rights groups. </p> <p><strong>Thommo's great gaffe</strong></p> <p>Derek Thompson's presence as raceday host and paddock announcer at Great Leighs caused its usual mixture of humour and embarrassment as the Essex track hosted a three-day Summer Carnival last week. One particularly cringeworthy moment came when the Channel 4 presenter, meandering around the winner's enclosure with a microphone, spotted a man in a wheelchair. After a bit of general banter, Thommo asked him: 'So tell me about this machine, how fast does it go?' On getting the reply 'About three miles per hour', Thommo guffawed: 'Ho ho, I hope your tips go faster!' </p> <p><strong>What's in a name?</strong></p> <p>Trainer George Baker has often been mixed up with his jockey namesake, but there could be even greater confusion next year. A yearling Camacho colt bought last week at Doncaster sales by owner Harry Findlay is going to be named George Baker. He will be trained by George Baker and will be ridden by his namesake (right). 'I spoke to the jockey GB last night and he seemed as thrilled by this plan as we are. George Baker will be trained by George Baker and ridden by George Baker,' says the trainer on his blog.</p>",
  "<p><strong>'I'm excited. We've got great talent here in the UK and hopefully we can showcase that - we're happy that we're developing the team and getting better.'</strong></p> <p>Luol Deng, NBA superstar, August 2008, discussing his hopes for British basketball and the Great Britain team in the London 2012 Olympics. </p> <p><strong>'Yes. I've set it out as saying that's something that can happen.'</strong></p> <p>NBA commissioner David Stern, March 2008, on plans for expansion into Europe during the next decade.</p> <p><strong>'This is the crucial time for British basketball. But we need Luol Deng on court. He could still play in the European qualifiers starting on Wednesday against Israel. I was only 20 per cent hopeful we could find a solution. Now, it's 75 per cent.'</strong></p> <p>GB basketball chief, Chris Spice, last week, discussing the NBA insurance policy that threatens Deng's international future, and which has disastrous implications for GB's London 2012 hopes and the overall prospects for the sport.</p> <p>Luol Deng is a Sudan-born 23-year-old who, with his family, fled to Egypt from his homeland before being granted asylum in Britain and growing up in south London. He is also a 6ft 9in basketball player who has just signed a mammoth $71m, six-year deal for the Chicago Bulls in the NBA, making him one of the biggest fish in a league that broadcasts to 215 countries in 41 different languages, and is the focal point of a sport that Fiba, the governing body, says is enjoyed by more than 400m people worldwide. </p> <p>Yet despite the riches and glamour he enjoys, Deng is fiercely loyal to the country that offered refuge to his family, making him determined to ensure Britain qualify for London 2012. That ambition began last summer when he played in all six matches that drove the team to promotion into Division A of the European Championship for the first time - a status that, Fiba insists, must be maintained if Britain are to play in the Olympics.</p> <p>Now, in three days, GB begin a round of six matches over a fortnight in the hope of qualifying for next summer's finals in Poland. Success will mean that their vital Division A status cannot be affected until after Fiba makes its decision in 2011. This crucial period starts with a meeting against Israel on Wednesday, includes a showpiece meeting against the Czech Republic on Saturday at a sold-out O2 Arena and finishes against Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina on 20 September. The squad is missing four players who have been pulled by their clubs, as well as Ben Gordon, Deng's team-mate at the Bulls. But GB were buoyed yesterday by the news that their star performer will be allowed to play after British Performance Basketball (BPB) agreed to meet the demands of Deng's American insurers.</p> <p>Deng's international future will also hugely affect the plans of the NBA to expand the sport here. A London franchise based at the O2 - and David Beckham, who is often seen at LA Lakers games, has expressed an interest in owning a team - would be an attractive prospect for Stern's organisation, who have just sold out a second successive NBA exhibition match at the O2 in October.</p> <p>And, if the domestic professional game is to grow - it has been factionalised, and the British Basketball League is not currently on television - and a sport second only to football in participation among children aged 11-16 and played by nearly 300,000 adults is to develop, then a Deng-led GB team is a prerequisite.</p> <p>'One reason football maintains its popularity is because kids look up to the superstars of the Premier League,' says John Amaechi, who, in the 1990s, became the first British player to break into the NBA. 'And if we're concerned with a legacy from the London Olympics, and a sport that can appeal to urban and other areas by penetrating the strata of young people in Britain, a game with no fixed demographic, that includes girls and boys, Asians and blacks, then it's basketball,' adds the owner of Manchester's Amaechi Centre, one of only two dedicated basketball sites in the country.</p> <p>'What do we need?' asks Pops Mensah-Bonsu, who grew up in Tottenham and played for Hackney White Heat in east London before making it into the NBA with the Dallas Mavericks. 'Basically to have an effect in the Olympics or European Championship. And especially for players like Luol Deng or myself - if we can have a positive impact in the NBA or Europe, kids will start noticing there's another sport in England.' </p> <p>Deng's international future was in jeopardy because of a minor back injury he suffered playing for the Bulls last November that caused MetLife, the NBA's insurance company, to refuse him cover. This means that BPB - formed after the Olympic bid was won in 2005 - had to find an insurer suitable to the Bulls and NBA, and pay an insurance bill of around \u00a3250,000 to allow Deng to face Israel on Wednesday. They have now found the extra premium and arranged alternative insurance. Justifying the outlay, British Basketball Performance Director, Chris Spice, said: 'Although no team is completely dependent on one player, we have concluded that this year's key first campaign in EuroBasket Division A would be heavily weakened by the loss of Luol as part of the line-up.</p> <p>'We see no medical reason why the NBA insurers have demanded this comp-letely new element to Luol's insurance, but as their demand came so late and out of the blue, we have had no choice.' </p> <p>'We cannot say how this problem will affect his participation in future years, but hope the American parties will acknowledge the medical situation as we believe it to be and change their demands.' The NBA's deal with MetLife allows the insurance company to refuse cover for 14 players based on their medical situation and length of contract. It is not known how many in total are non-American - the NBA will not say - but it is an issue executives at BPB feel may be relevant to Deng's situation.</p> <p>'We'd like to know exactly how many of the 14 are not Americans,' says a BPB source. 'Because if you're a foreign player in the NBA then by definition you'll be wanted for your national team in the summer when internationals are played and increase the risk of injury. </p> <p>'It's a little like here in the Premier League and the club versus country dispute - and may be a way of the NBA saving money.'</p> <p>Although this appears to make the NBA's position in the dispute confused - after all, it is in their interest to see Deng play for GB if it is to continue its expansion plans - Observer Sport understands the league is working hard for a long-term resolution to the situation. </p> <p>'Playing for Great Britain is very important to me,' said Deng. And he does not rule out playing one day for a London-based NBA franchise. 'I'm happy with Chicago. But if the NBA's going to experiment then that would be great. I just want more than anything kids here and all over Europe to play basketball. For my hometown to have a team - that would be unbelievable while I'm still playing.'</p> <p>At the end of this year, UK Sport decides the funding for the next four-year cycle that will take basketball into the London Olympics. If, despite the presence of Deng, results go the wrong way for GB - the women's A Division record is currently three defeats and a victory - the elite game could suffer a financial body blow that will also have implications at grassroots level. </p> <p>A competitive national basketball team and the possibility of an NBA franchise based on these shores would have seemed highly unrealistic until very recently for a sport that was disorganised and suffered from in-fighting at club and international level. Following the failed attempt to qualify for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Great Britain dissolved as an entity and there were disputes between the various home nations. </p> <p>And after a record 14,251 watched the Manchester Giants play the London Leopards in 1995, the club game also began to slide. 'Until two or three years ago, the British Basketball League [formed in 1988] hadn't been a good model for at least a decade,' says an executive closely involved in the restructuring of the sport since 2005. 'The BBL had money left over from the ITV Digital deal, but didn't invest and was run by people owning teams whose objective was making money. But it has got better.'</p> <p>Although basketball has been played for over a century here and the English Basketball Association formed in 1936, it was not until 1972 that the English National Basketball League for Men was born, followed by a national league for women three years later. </p> <p>'I grew up playing the game,' says Mick Luckhurst, who swapped sports to become a kicker in the National Football League for the Atlanta Falcons in the 1980s before presenting Channel 4's coverage of the NFL. 'In 1977 I played for a club called the Avenue in London. We were under-21 champions in 1976 before I went to the States. But the standard then was night and day. I couldn't get into a high-school team as a college player - that's why I switched.</p> <p>'I've been over here for 30-odd years and what's happened?' asks Luckhurst, whose daughter Nikki made her debut for GB women this summer. 'Suddenly England guys are coming over to America with Europeans and playing in the NBA. The NBA players are in Europe and the last two Olympics [before Beijing] the Americans got their butts kicked. The world has changed.'</p> <p>Luckhurst believes basketball is simple for young children to play at home. 'Absolutely. How much does it cost? You need a basketball and a hoop. Over here every house has a backboard - you'll see that more and more in England.'</p> <p>Sport England says there are '4,217 courts marked out in halls across England' and just 281 of these 'have no public access.' But there are issues preventing the sport becoming a popular pastime. </p> <p>'The difficulties are facilities, getting a game - there are a shortage of competitions - and cost,' says England Basketball chief executive Keith Mair, who also coached New Zealand at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. 'We've heard of some junior women teams in the national league only practising one hour a week. You won't get much improvement like that.</p> <p>'We're based at the England Institute of Sport in Sheffield. The court here started at \u00a315 per hour for the public but now it's \u00a337, and it's going up in January. In France, for example, you can play anywhere because it's free.'</p> <p>Mensah-Bonsu, who is now 24 and plays for Joventut Badalona in the top division of Spain, which has the strongest men's and women's leagues in Europe, says that growing up in Tottenham 'you wouldn't see anybody out playing. The kids now are the generation we have to focus on. Basketball definitely has to become an extra-curricular sport - it's a chance to give them something to do and go find a club. That's what I had to do - my dad took me along.'</p> <p>Amaechi is scathing about the structure of the professional game, and efforts made to grow the sport. 'It's God-awful,' he says of the BBL, which consists of 11 English and one Scottish franchises. 'The BBL is the worst basketball in the world - its standard, style of play, and professionalism. And in terms of development, I'd have them go away. England Basketball has it down better,' he says of Mair's organisation, which looks after the senior men, women and age-group leagues all the way down to under-13 level. 'I would direct you to what Ron Scott is trying to do at the British Basketball Association.'</p> <p>Scott is chief executive of the BBA which, he says, plans to launch an 'eight-franchise league in September 2009 between the GB and NBA [exhibition] games, and will attract quality players from the US, UK and Europe.' The BBA's board includes Ed Tapscott, former CEO of the Charlotte Bobcats, the last start-up NBA franchise, and Mark Pannes, once the youngest ever NBA vice-president of marketing. 'We're committed to building the sport here with a broad base of UK and US business and basketball experts.'</p> <p>What does he think of the BBL? 'We've tried to work with them but they don't respond to e-mails. They can't produce any meaningful sport. Guildford Heat was the BBL's best team last year - well, they played in the ULEB Cup [Europe's second-tier competition] and didn't win a game. The overall player budget for the best of the franchises is not even \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>'And they can't attract television - when we launch, we'll pay for our TV production for the first one or two years.'</p> <p>BBL chairman Paul Blake refutes these claims. He points to his own Newcastle Eagles franchise and its 'community-based programme - the model all BBL clubs are operating - which allows children of 11 to see a possible career pathway in the sport, and is also educational. There were no junior clubs here in 2000, now our foundation runs 15 and their leagues, which range from under-12 to senior level. Also, our membership has grown in the last eight years from 178 to 1700.'</p> <p>And the threat of the BBA? 'The BBL have had a contract for 20 years to run men's premier professional basketball. I'm not entirely sure how any new operation would be able to exist.'</p> <p>While UK Sport gave just over \u00a33.6m to BPB and sent Kristy Lavin, GB Women's Player of the Year, to Beijing as part of the BOA's Ambition Programme because, she says, 'the majority of people that have medalled have already attended an Olympics', Amaechi feels more frustration at the government's approach.</p> <p>'Sure, GB had a good haul of medals in Beijing but in sailing and rowing - I live near Moss Side in Manchester and I'm not sure how many boats I'll see there. We can't get the co-operation to build more basketball centres. It has to come from Sport England,' he says of the organisation that distributes public money for infrastructure. Its figures state that since 2005 more than \u00a314m has been given to basketball, though it does say 'these are for projects where basketball is classified as the lead sport, so do not represent the total investment that has benefited basketball.'</p> <p>What would certainly be of benefit for the sport is a British superstar playing in the most glamorous league in the world who is also the leader of a Great Britain team in the four-year build-up to the London 2012 Olympics. At the moment, then, much would seem to depend on Deng's long-term international future. 'This country has so much talent, so much to offer this sport,' he says.</p> <p>Hopefully, it will get a chance to do just that.</p>",
  "<p>Early on Friday 1 August 2008, Nicholas Rice made a mistake that may just have saved his life. He spilled a pan of water. The Californian was sitting in his tent at Camp IV on the shoulder of K2's south-east ridge, preparing to leave for the summit. Getting ready to do anything at 7,900 metres above sea level takes a long time. Melting the snow for that pan of water must have taken an hour. It's as if time accelerates, leaving you plodding along behind, taking an age to put on boots, an epoch to fasten crampons and zip up clothing. To a brain fogged from lack of oxygen, mistakes come easily.</p> <p>Rice had planned to be on his way at 3am, but the mishap set him back. As he fumbled the pan, water had slopped over his socks. Stuffing his feet into high-altitude climbing boots when they were wet did not appeal. He risked frostbite setting out like that, so he decided to dry them out first. For a 23-year-old, Rice has a lot of high-altitude experience and a wise head on his young shoulders. K2 would still be there next year. The trick, as British mountaineer Don Whillans used to say, would be to make sure that he was.</p> <p>Once his socks were dry, Rice headed out into the freezing Karakoram morning. With around 30 climbers ahead of him, the route to the summit was clearly marked. From the tents at Camp IV, a snow slope steepens gradually as it rises to meet a band of rock about 250m up the slope. Kicking his feet into the steps left by the other climbers, Rice began to follow them. He was the last man to leave for the summit that day.</p> <p>The steps led to a snow-filled gully in the left-hand end of the rock band that sits beneath an enormous ice cliff, called a serac, some 90m high at its apex. A serac forms when a glacier pushes over a steep drop on a mountainside. As this ice creeps down the mountain, chunks drop off without warning. Warmer conditions can provoke a serac fall, but they also happen in the dead of night. What tons of falling ice will do to a body does not take much imagination.</p> <p>For this reason, mountaineers avoid climbing underneath seracs - if they can. Yet, sometimes, the only practicable route means exposing yourself to the possibility that a huge mass of ice might break off and crush you at any moment. The top of the south-east ridge on K2 is one of those places. It is the kind of situation in which you have to make a simple calculation: is this worth it?</p> <p>Rice knew that where the gully ran up against the gleaming grey ice of the serac, the footsteps would turn left to where the ice cliff diminished. The ground here is more awkward and steeper. It takes climbers to the ridgeline above the vast gulf of the mountain's south face, a drop of 3,000m to the glacier. It is also the key to passing the overhanging serac and reaching the easier-angled slopes above, which lead to the summit. This section is called the Bottleneck. Even before this summer, more than 10 climbers had died here.</p> <p>After an hour's effort, Rice began to reconsider his attempt. He was not using bottled oxygen and, despite the effort of punching up the snow slope, his hands stayed frozen. 'I could have summitted,' he told America's NPR radio via satellite phone a few days later, 'but I wasn't going to lose a finger. Not even the tip of a finger.'</p> <p>Rice could feel the day turning against him. He could see dozens of climbers ahead, in their own private worlds as they struggled towards the summit. Their sheer number was a threat. He could feel his fingers wooden inside his mitts. His instinct nagged at him to descend, so he did. Released from the agony of grinding uphill, Rice was soon back in his sleeping bag. Little more than a day later, 11 of the climbers gasping in the thin air above Rice's tent were dead, turning the 2008 season into the second-worst on record. </p> <p>K2. 'K' for Karakoram, which is the name of the range of mountains, '2' as opposed to K1, which, as the 1856 Survey of India discovered, had a local name, Masherbrum. K2 was just too remote for the locals to bother. Those who see it up close for the first time are left in a state of mild shock. At Concordia, where the Baltoro Glacier meets the Godwin-Austen Glacier flowing from K2, it fills the sky. Reinhold Messner, the first person to climb all of the world's peaks over 8,000m, once said: 'An artist made this peak.' Its irregular triangle snags a climber's mind like a barbed hook. On the Pakistan side, the altitude at Concordia is 4,700m, just three hours from base camp, while the summit rises up almost another 4km into the deep blue of high altitude. On its steeper north side, in China, it climbs 3.2km in just 3km of horizontal distance.</p> <p>The Australian Greg Child, who reached the summit by its north ridge in 1990, summed up the appeal: 'K2 just has something about it. Partly it's the shape and beauty and symmetry of the thing. And partly it's the infamy - the stories of what's happened to people who've tried it: how fucked up they've become and how many have died. K2 is simply not an amateur's mountain.'</p> <p>The bald statistics are bad enough. There have been around 300 ascents of K2, and 77 deaths. Journalists frequently divide the first number by the second to come up with a death rate of one in four. That is way off the mark. The first figure does not include those who don't reach the summit. Even so, the fatality rate among those who do make the top is around 11 per cent, worse odds than one in 10 and an indication that it is in the descent that many of the dangers lie. When friends go to Everest, it does not trouble me. On the far fewer occasions one goes to K2, I feel anxious. I felt it most strongly talking to English climber Alison Hargreaves, just before she left in 1995 on the second leg of her attempt to climb the three highest mountains in the world in one year. She was blasted off the summit ridge by hurricane winds on 13 August, killed along with five others. Eight died that season, five the year before. And five the year before that.</p> <p>When Nicholas Rice moved up to make his summit bid, he had been on the mountain for more than two months. K2 base camp is not an easy place to be for that length of time. After two months, sleeping in a tent and defecating al fresco begin to grate. Jim Curran, who witnessed the 1986 tragedy, when 13 climbers from nine different parties died, and wrote a definitive history of the mountain, saw first-hand the slow mental attrition of waiting for a chance at the summit.</p> <p>From Everest base camp, he explains, you can walk four hours and be lounging on grass, drinking beer with trekkers. It takes more than a week to trek the 40 miles from the last village to K2 base camp. 'K2 stands absolutely on its own. The approach is hard. The base camp feels like the Moon. The mountain itself looks utterly impregnable, and there's no easy way up the thing.'</p> <p>Worse, the weather is like a slow form of torture. Once acclimatised, climbers wait in nervous anticipation. On Everest, weather patterns are predictable. Climbers expect a weather window during the latter half of May. On K2, you cannot be sure when, or even if, good weather will arrive. Three seasons this decade there has been no ascent at all. That has not happened on Everest since 1974. 'The problem is that the good weather spell is often enough to get to you to the top but not to get you down again,' Curran says.</p> <p>Of course, given that no one knows for sure how long the good weather will last, when - if - it arrives, those climbers still interested rush up the mountain. That is why K2's accidents often happen all at once and it is what happened at the end of this July. A number of teams converged at Camp IV on the shoulder of the south-east ridge, some via the Abruzzi Spur, others up a parallel route on a spur to the left called the Cesen Route.</p> <p>The latter included Wilco van Rooijen from Holland and members of his international team. Van Rooijen had been to K2 before and had climbed Everest without oxygen. Irish climber Gerard McDonnell was part of this group. They had been on the mountain longer than anyone else, the first of a reported 16 expeditions to climb on K2 this season, and were making their third attempt on the summit. With that number of expeditions there were bound to be tensions. You need to co-operate, but you do not want to let a less competent party spoil your summit bid. Especially if you have been waiting two months.</p> <p>Rice also used the Cesen Route. Joining him was a Frenchman, Hugues d'Aubar\u00e8de, an insurance agent from Lyon, aged 61 and on his third expedition to K2. At that age, time was not on his side. He had come alone with two Pakistani porters to support him, Meherban Karim and Jehan Baig. D'Aubar\u00e8de said that over the course of the expedition he came to regard Rice like a son.</p> <p>A Korean team had fixed rope on the Abruzzi Spur and they, too, were at Camp IV. There were also teams from Italy and Serbia, and strong Norwegian and Basque climbers. One of the Italians was a professional mountain rescuer, Marco Confortola; the Norwegians included 33-year-old called Rolf Bae and his new wife Cecilie Skog, a former nurse who is the only woman to have completed the so-called 'explorer's grand slam' (climbing the highest peak on each continent and reaching both poles). Bae, a world-class polar traveller, had just spent 27 days climbing a vertical and overhanging granite wall called Great Trango Tower in northern Pakistan, a climb far harder than K2. Finally, there was an American-led expedition that included Australians and a Swede, Fredrik Strang.</p> <p>Later, from his hospital bed, van Rooijen would say that there had been too many climbers on the mountain that day. Some of these expeditions were marriages of convenience, sharing the cost of logistics to achieve a personal goal. Some were close-knit teams from the same country. Some climbers were much stronger than others. And some, according to comments Confortola made later, were not as good as they thought they were. He called these, sarcastically, 'professori'. Critically, all these groups understood co-operation was vital, especially in the business of fixing ropes. But things don't always work out that way, especially when language differences mean K2 is, most years, a 4km-high tower of Babel. </p> <p>At 11pm on the night of 31 July, as Nicholas Rice rested in his tent, he was disturbed by Sherpas and Pakistani porters getting ready to leave for the upper section of the mountain. Although none of these expeditions was a commercial guided trip of the kind now seen on Everest, many of them had hired one or two Sherpas, flown in from Nepal to add logistical muscle.</p> <p>Victor Saunders, an experienced Everest guide whose company Basecamp is organising an expedition to K2 next summer, says bringing one Sherpa over costs around \u00a35,000. But they are worth the money. 'When the Pakistanis are good,' he says, 'they are very good. But currently they are not as reliable or experienced as the Sherpas.' Given that the local population and the Sherpas both speak a dialect of Tibetan, the two groups, Muslim and Buddhist, can work together well. But on the morning of 1 August, the Sherpas were anxious because, according to Rice, the Pakistani porters were slow to get going and in poor morale.</p> <p>It was these porters' job to go ahead and fix ropes at the steeper sections of the Bottleneck, to give those that followed extra security and a fast way off the mountain. A complex deal, some of which was lost in translation, had been agreed between the Dutch, Italians, Koreans and Americans about who would do what to ensure that sufficient rope was properly fixed and that the route was marked. Some K2 climbers may feel this was asking for trouble.</p> <p>It seems the first Western climber to leave was the Basque, Alberto Zerain. He alone would have a perfect summit day. At around 2.30am, Rice heard the Dutch team, d'Aubar\u00e8de and the Serbians leaving camp. Later, the Italians, Norwegians and finally the Americans left, crampons squeaking in the snow, breath rasping in the dry air, as they climbed off into the night, their headlamps points of light on the black mountain. </p> <p>At 7am, after his aborted attempt, Rice woke in his tent. The Americans were coming back. They told him that the Sherpas and Pakistanis had not fixed the rope at the top of the snow gully and across the traverse, but lower down where it wasn't needed. Not wanting to stand around while the ropes were brought up and fixed on the more difficult traverse, and anxious about the numbers of climbers, they had decided to go back to Camp IV. Other teams waited.</p> <p>That, at least, is what Rice put on his blog when he got back to base camp. But it's not what Confortola said in a phone interview after his agonising descent. He said that five Sherpas had been assigned to fix the traverse out of the Bottleneck, but that others had completed this task using low-quality anchors fixed into the ice and cheap rope. 'You couldn't even tie hay bales with it.'</p> <p>Who fixed these ropes is one of several unanswered questions, but if it wasn't the Sherpas, it was most likely the Pakistani porters. Sorting these ropes out took time and slowed the climbers down. Getting up and down in daylight was everyone's priority. At around 8am, a Serbian, 32-year-old Dren Mandic, became detached from the fixed rope and fell, his body accelerating down the slope before coming to rest above Camp IV. </p> <p>Accounts differ as to how he came to be off the rope - perhaps he was trying to overtake another climber - but van Rooijen said: 'That was a really stupid accident. These accidents are not supposed to happen on K2. People are not used to climbing these technical parts. Everest you can climb without technical experience.' Traversing out of the Bottleneck, he said, is 'a very technical traverse at 8,200 metres'.</p> <p>The other Serbians and their porters descended to help Mandic, but he was already dead. Two of the American team who had returned to Camp IV, Strang and Eric Meyer, climbed back up to see if they could help bring Mandic's body down, only to find a chaotic scene. In the rush to help, one of the porters, Jehan Baig, also lost his footing and fell to his death. When Strang brought news of this back to Camp IV, Rice packed at once to descend. His K2 season was over.</p> <p>Confortola says it was he who refocused the group on getting busy with the climb and, once they did, progress was better. The Koreans were using oxygen and drew ahead of the Norwegians, followed by the Dutch, Confortola, d'Aubar\u00e8de, and McDonnell. But the first to reach the summit, at 3pm, was Alberto Zerain. Not bothering to wait while the ropes were sorted out, he had climbed on, reaching the top with plenty of daylight left to make a safe descent.</p> <p>Two of the Norwegians, Cecilie Skog and Lars Naesse, reached the summit two hours later. Oystein Stangeland had turned back earlier, for reasons that have not yet become clear, while Rolf Bae, perhaps exhausted from his climb on Great Trango, had fallen behind on the ascent. According to a spokesman for the Norwegians, Bj\u00f8rn Sekkes\u00e6ter, the three reconvened just below the summit and made the descent together with Bae in the lead. As he crossed back into the Bottleneck, he caught the full force of a huge chunk of ice that peeled off the serac some time in the early evening. 'Cecilie was behind Rolf, attached by rope, and she felt a shiver,' Sekkes\u00e6ter reports. 'It only took Rolf; the rope snapped under the weight of the ice.' Bae was killed outright. </p> <p>One can only imagine what Skog must have been feeling; the couple had been married since just May 2007. However, she needed to continue the descent and the ropes that had been set up earlier had now been washed away by the ice slide. She and Naesse used a 100m Kevlar rope to abseil down one of the steeper sections, but the line was not long enough. They were forced to climb down backwards until they reached the less precarious part of the shoulder on the south-east ridge. They eventually reached Camp IV between 11pm and midnight. 'Rolf's accident was pure bad luck,' Sekkes\u00e6ter told OSM. 'He didn't trip, he didn't make a mistake. Other people died from doing the wrong thing, like unclipping themselves from the rope... But he wanted to be on K2, so he was on the right spot at the wrong time.' </p> <p>In a seemingly unrelated incident, Jumic Bhote, one of the Koreans' Nepalese porters, was also hit by ice, and a second Nepalese, Pasang Bhote, tried to help him. Both fell to their deaths.</p> <p>Above the Bottleneck, a number of climbers were either just reaching the summit or were on their way down. These included Wilco van Rooijen and Cas van de Gevel with their Sherpa Pemba Gyalje, Gerard McDonnell - the first Irishman to climb K2 - Marco Confortola, and Hugues d'Aubar\u00e8de with his Pakistani high-altitude porter, Meherban Karim. 'I'm too cold,' d'Aubar\u00e8de told friends at home from the summit via satellite phone. 'I'm too happy.' Three of the Koreans, Park Kyeong-hyo, 28, Kim Hyo-gyeong, 33, and Hwang Dong-jin, 44, were also still descending to the Bottleneck. </p> <p>Confortola knew they had to hurry. He reached the top at 7pm in temperatures of -20C. As night fell, this would plummet to something like -40C. In down suits but with no tents or sleeping bags, or a stove to melt snow, surviving the night would be a bitter struggle. All the climbers had missed the previous night's sleep. None would be able to get much rest that night either. And they were still above 8,000m. In the death zone.</p> <p>'I was with the Dutch,' Confortola says. 'I kept looking at my wristwatch. We were so late. On the top I've literally taken four pictures, and then we started down. Problem was, during the descent, no one had the route flags we had agreed to bring. I had a few in my sack, but not enough. And during the night, a bit tired, a bit confused because we climbed without oxygen, disaster struck.'</p> <p>There was no moon as he descended with McDonnell. The two had become good friends, despite the language barrier, and Confortola had nicknamed McDonnell 'Jesus', because of his beard. At 8.30pm, still above the serac barrier, Confortola heard a sound and told the Irishman to stop. Below, they could see the three Koreans had fallen or been hit by ice. Assuming they could not survive the fall, Confortola decided enough was enough, and suggested they bivouac. They would go on when they could see what was happening. </p> <p>Later, reports claimed that the 10 climbers were trapped above the Bottleneck because the ropes had been swept away when Rolf Bae died. But Cas van de Gevel and Sherpa Pemba Gyalje managed to use what light was left to descend to Camp IV that evening. It was the lack of visibility that stopped the others. In the morning they would be able to see to climb the difficult ground back to the gully leading down to Camp IV.</p> <p>Confortola dug shallow pits to sit in, perched above the huge drop of the south face. He extended McDonnell's a little because the Irishman was suffering more. Wilco van Rooijen, similarly disorientated, also bivouacked. Hugues d'Aubar\u00e8de, older and running on empty, seems to have collapsed and died on the descent from the summit. His porter Meherban Karim fell, attempting to climb down without him.</p> <p>During the night Confortola had rubbed the Irishman's legs while he made himself shiver to keep his body temperature up. In the morning, he and McDonnell were in a state of abject exhaustion. At first light, he saw van Rooijen descending. They tried to talk to each other but, Confortola says: 'My English is awful.' After the Dutchman was gone, McDonnell moved across the slope to urinate and spotted the Koreans. They were still alive. He called out to Confortola.</p> <p>Struggling down the ropes, Confortola and McDonnell tried to improvise a rescue. The Koreans had spent the night hanging off a fixed rope and were most probably beyond saving. At least one was badly injured, and two were unconscious. Confortola noticed one had lost his gloves and boots, so he stuck a spare glove on his exposed foot. The Koreans' limbs would have been frozen solid, but still, Confortola tried to get them upright. Time seemed to slide past unnoticed.</p> <p>At 3pm, four Sherpas arrived to help and Confortola abandoned his efforts to save the Koreans in order to save himself. 'I tried everything and more, but I simply couldn't do it, could not take them back home. In my role of mountain rescuer I felt worthless, I felt useless. I come down, do the traverse, descend the Bottleneck, and then at the bottom I hear this big booming noise. I look up and 400 metres above there's this big avalanche coming down from the serac, and below some boots. I've recognised them - it was Jesus.'</p> <p>With the Koreans beyond help, and McDonnell dead, one of the Sherpas, Pemba, brought Confortola down to Camp IV. Even then they were hit by another fall of ice. Then Pemba went out to look for van Rooijen, who had failed to find the camp. They missed each other. Van Rooijen had descended on the wrong side of the ridgeline as clouds gathered, obscuring features that could have guided him home. He was forced to spend a second night out, his lips and tongue blistered from dehydration, his mind hallucinating wildly as exhaustion took its toll. Next day he stumbled into Camp III on the Cesen Route, where team-mates fed him drink and oxygen.</p> <p>The combination of the high death toll and K2's grim reputation put the tragedy high on news bulletins around the world. Stories of desperate rescue attempts and climbers trapped high on the mountain were fed by phone calls and emails from base camp. Very quickly, those early news stories gave way to gloomy commentaries on the credentials of those tackling the mountain.</p> <p>After putting the story on the front page, the New York Times website was filled with readers' comments, mostly saying the same thing: 'Utterly pointless'; 'Reckless incompetents commit utterly predictable suicide'; 'No sympathy. Sorry.' Under the headline 'Does Climbing Matter Anymore?', the paper quoted veterans including Reinhold Messner railing against what climbing on K2 had become: 'People today are booking these K2 package deals almost as if they were buying some all-inclusive trip to Bangkok.'</p> <p>Mountaineer and historian David Roberts warned that money was warping the motivation of those on the highest peaks. True, there were some old-school climbers around, 'but now climbers are sponsored. They are making big bucks on speaking tours. There is a whole new breed of wannabes who see it as a shortcut to fame or at least notoriety.'</p> <p>To older mountaineers, there were some obvious ironies in these comments. Messner, after all, has made a fortune from sponsorship deals and lecture tours. He had dubbed K2 the 'mountain of mountains' on the cover of one of his many books. In the building of K2's brand, the Italian lent a considerable hand. To suggest K2's slopes were clogged with incompetents was laughable.</p> <p>Still, it must be irksome for those who have shared in K2's greatest triumphs, the noble rescues, the dedicated teamwork, to see that heritage diluted by the image of lesser talents who buy and bluff their way to the kind of glory true heroes earned the hard way. Imagine if you could pay cash to play in a rematch of the 1966 World Cup final. And now imagine how Bobby Charlton would feel about that.</p> <p>As it happens, those mountaineers breaking new ground are rarely found on K2 these days. They do not rely on ropes fixed to the mountain by someone else. They do not use porters. K2 was first climbed as long ago as 1954 via the Abruzzi Spur. It's tough, it's dangerous even by Himalayan standards, and it gets respect from the very best. But standards have moved on since 1954. A lot.</p> <p>Messner, however, has left a curious legacy. A dozen or so others have now repeated his feat of climbing the 14 peaks over the height of 8,000m, including Briton Alan Hinkes. The simplicity of the idea and the fact that most of these peaks are well known makes it an easy sell to sponsors. It's like a freakishly dangerous form of Munro-bagging. Partly thanks to Messner's list, many of these giant peaks - Everest, K2, Nanga Parbat - are fixed in the public's imagination. The routes of their first ascents, done more than 50 years ago, attract more climbers than all the other thousands of peaks in the Himalaya put together. A small semi-nomadic international community of high-altitude climbers return again and again to these Himalayan giants like bees to a flower. The attrition rate seems quite horrendous to outsiders, but it's a dramatic, adventurous life that attracts dramatic, adventurous people.</p> <p>The aftershocks of this year's season on K2 will resonate for a long time. Marco Confortola remains depressed and angry, particularly about the death of McDonnell. He must face up to a long and painful recovery from frostbite, as does Wilco van Rooijen. Both men were evacuated by helicopter to hospital in Islamabad. Cecilie Skog flew back to Norway within days of reaching base camp, escaping the media to be with her family.</p> <p>Many questions remain. No version of events has emerged that answers all the contradictions and gaps in the narrative. It is possible, given the confusion generated by exhaustion and hypoxia, it never will. Facts and the memory of them can seem hazy at sea level, let alone among a strung-out group of climbers whose brains are dying.</p> <p>Those who believe high-altitude mountaineering has become a selfish and consumerist travesty of itself will find the facts to fit their theories. But it is worth stating that among the climbers on K2 this year, Rolf Bae was truly gifted, while van Rooijen and Confortola showed incredible stamina. Many climbers and porters fought hard to help each other, at grave risk to their own safety. </p> <p>Climbers die in the Karakoram every year. But then climbers die on Mont Blanc or in Scotland. Mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, whether practised by saints or sinners. Many climbers, I would guess, would be only too pleased if newspapers listened to the readers of the New York Times and stopped reporting accidents. Nicholas Rice, meanwhile, is thinking about going back. 'Maybe not next year. Maybe not the year after. But I can say for sure I'll come back. It's always been a dream of mine to be up there.' </p> <h2>K2: Death and the mountain</h2> <p><strong>1953</strong></p> <p>On one of the earliest expeditions, injured American Art Gilkey is in a makeshift stretcher when he slips from the mountain and disappears. The memorial at base camp to all K2's dead is named after him.</p> <p><strong>1986</strong></p> <p>Alan Rouse becomes the first Briton to conquer K2, on 4 August. He dies six days later, trying to wait out a storm. Thirteen people died on the mountain in this year.</p> <p><strong>1995</strong></p> <p>'Summit or die, either way I win,' says Rob Slater before tackling K2. Ominous words: the American and six others, including Briton Alison Hargreaves, are killed in a freak storm.</p> <p><strong>2004</strong></p> <p>Seven climbers die from June to August, including three South Koreans, found in a crevice in their sleeping bags, and Manel de la Matta from Spain, who develops appendicitis during his descent as part of a Catalan expedition.</p> <p><strong>2006</strong></p> <p>Four Russians die 200 metres from the summit when struck by a 'silent' avalanche.</p>",
  "<p>I hurry, straight off the plane from London, to Gate 14 at Rogers Centre, home of the Toronto Blue Jays, just in time to see one of the greatest short stops in baseball history. Roberto Alomar, who retired in 2004 after a 16-year career, is being elevated to the team's 'Level of Excellence', a series of hoardings around the stadium that commemorates key Blue Jays figures; he makes a speech, a sell-out crowd go crazy beneath the fireworks, and I know that I have, once again, made the right choice: spending my holiday alone on the other side of the world, watching a sport that leaves almost everyone I know cold. </p> <p>Alomar was adored during the Blue Jays' most successful era, which brought them back-to-back World Series glory in 1992 and 1993. I came to Toronto in 1994, and they haven't won a single thing since. I think, without them knowing it, I may be their curse. </p> <p>So, let me begin at the start.</p> <p>I was 18 years old, and had been brought up in Belfast with a football glued to my feet, when I scored a free trip off the back of 'the Troubles': young Catholics and Protestants sent on holiday together on government money, to spend the best part of three months hugging each other and apologising on behalf of our religions. Who was I to argue? </p> <p>I ended up staying in Canada for a year, working for the Toronto Sun and blagging couch space from those who found my accent threatening enough not to refuse. I earned about $180 a week, which ruled out restaurants, clubs and all but one strip joint (thank you, Zanzibar). The search for budget entertainment led me to baseball and a cheap seat in the heavens. I would have preferred to watch the local ice hockey team, the Maple Leafs, but those tickets exist in a parallel universe I have yet to discover. And since the demise of the Montreal Expos in 2004, the Rogers Centre has been the only ballpark in a country obsessed with the rink: so, outsider as I was, I already had something in common with my fellow fans. </p> <p>My holidays since have repeated the same pattern: ignoring every other destination on the planet to immerse myself, here, in baseball. The Major League season runs from April to October and each team plays 162 games, across an entire continent. In a normal week they play six games - and my plan is to see them all, beginning with a three-game, opening week home series against the 2007 World Series champions, the Boston Red Sox.</p> <p>My seat as I watch Alomar pick up his award is at level 'five hundred' - back in the heavens, close to the spot where I watched my first ever game. Given the occasion, the fact that the Red Sox are here and it's the first home game of the season, imagine the type of money I had to fork out to be here at all. $60? $100? Try eight dollars, or four quid in real money. Later in the week I will shell out \u00a328.50 to sit right behind home plate, close enough to hear the umpire's 'ssttrrriikke!', the dull thwack of ball on leather mitt and, best of all, the unique sound of a bat sending one up, up, up and gone.</p> <p>Baseball fans could not be any more different from football supporters. Here, everyone drinks alcohol and mingles freely in the stadium, seldom reacting to a rival fan in the very next seat as they goad a nearby outfielder. When the game is over, they trundle home safely. The police presence is almost nonexistent and the only trouble I witness is two slightly drunken fans being ejected from the ground for informing Red Sox legend Manny Ramirez, in a deafening rasp, that he 'fucking sucked', which, to be fair, he did. (He has since been traded to the LA Dodgers.)</p> <p>Tonight, the Jays defeat the Sox, as home pitcher AJ Burnett strikes out a line of household names. Walking back towards my hotel, I join in with the 20,000-strong mindless chants of 'Boston sucks! Boston sucks!' I am happy for many reasons but, above all, because I've witnessed a home run, and from the moment I saw my first - hit by Joe Carter, another man honoured in the Level of Excellence, nearly 15 years ago - the feeling of wide-eyed wonder has never changed. </p> <p>It remains the main reason I love baseball. I reckon, given enough time, I could put a football past a world-class keeper. In fact, I once scored a penalty against Chris Woods (OK, he was no longer England's No 1, but one pen, one goal). I'd also back almost anyone, given a full day, to sink a tricky 20-foot putt, catch a 50-yard pass or score a three-pointer. For the life of me, though, I can't see how I could smack a Major League pitch into the bleachers. There is only one place I can test this theory - so I pull on my jersey and head to a batting cage.</p> <p>On arrival, I am faced with three options; slow, medium and fast. I decide to start at medium, just to pick up the gist. The ball is to be spat from a machine at around 68mph. I stand ready, I hear the click of the machine, closely followed by a thump from the hanging pad directly behind me. I didn't see the baseball, but I can only assume that, at some stage, it whizzed past my ear. Fast forward one hour and I have actually managed to crack a few, even venturing into the fast cage, albeit for the pointless ceremony of it all. My wrists are throbbing and my ankle hosts a resplendent purple bruise, the result of a botched shot cannoning from bat to leg.</p> <p>Battered but not yet beaten, I try pitching. I simply have to toss the ball as hard as I can at a computer generated batter, no more than five yards away from my virtual mound. I stand tall, wind up, cock the leg and let rip with such velocity that I fear a hernia. It registers at 42mph. I try another 30 or so times and that turns out to be my fastball. Top Major League pitchers throw a fastball somewhere in the region of 100mph.</p> <p>My friend Greg Brady, a Toronto sports presenter, sums it up best: 'You can play them all, Colin, but you have to be born to play baseball.' He tells me this six beers - and 90 minutes - into game two of my journey. It is only 14 hours since the end of last night's game, yet I have never heard a player bemoaning the workload. The 'Bo Sox' travelled to Tokyo to launch the Major League season and the jetlag is beginning to show. We whack them all over the ballpark and run out winners by 10-2. In the third game, the Jays complete the sweep, and I get to see Frank Thomas crush a 'grand slam homer' - when there are runners on every base, meaning the team scores four runs - into the crowd, which leaves me on the floor, eyes watering with adrenaline, and a temporary lapse in the methodology of breathing. It is the most gratifying baseball experience of my life. </p> <p>Roy 'The Doc' Halladay is Toronto's most popular ball player. He's a pitcher who could have walked into any World Series side of the past decade, but has chosen to remain with just one team. My team. Meeting him is, for me, the equivalent of a beer with Stevie G or a kickabout with David Healy.</p> <p>Media relations in American sports are, however, a far cry from the protectionism of the Premier League. When I return to the Rogers Centre the following day, I'm told to make my way on to the pitch, where reporters and photographers are mingling freely with the players from both teams - only hours before their next game. As I sit in the dugout - the dugout! - waiting for The Doc, I receive numerous hellos, and tips of caps, from the Jays players. There are no stipulations from the press officer, apart from a polite request to put my coat on over the Halladay jersey I am wearing, as he's 'quite modest and that might be a bit, you know...'</p> <p>The Doc turns out to be a bashful, respectful figure. His story is little-train-that-could inspiring. Plucked out of high school by the Jays, his first season in the Major Leagues was a disaster, and he was sent back down to one of the club's minor-league teams, broken and worth very little to anyone. The Jays kept faith. And, after completely rebuilding his pitching style, he returned a different man. He has been their number-one pitcher ever since, even picking up the Cy Young Award, baseball's equivalent of the golden boot.</p> <p>Pitchers are gladiators. They stand elevated above all other players and if they have a bad day the team generally lose. There are not many other roles within team sports where one player feels such pressure. I ask him to take himself to Yankee Stadium, bottom of the ninth, everything resting on his shoulders. How does he not blow up? 'After I make a pitch, I have to start thinking about the next one,' he says matter-of-factly. After doing it over and over it's just like throwing down in the bullpen with nobody there. </p> <p>'For me it's the competition. There are so many things going on and so many things to pay attention to, that's always intrigued me. With pitching, so much goes into it: tendencies, what batters do, what they don't do, different counts, where to throw the ball...' It's a long, long list by the time he finishes. </p> <p>He says he stays in Toronto because 'there is not that separation between the athlete and other people. I like being a normal person.' Truth is he's anything but normal. He's the superhuman backbone of the only baseball team in Canada, yet he can walk down any street and 'people say hi and let me be on my way'.</p> <p>And that's what I do. He thanks me (me!) for talking to him (him!) and heads towards the locker room. First pitch is in 90 minutes.</p> <p>I'll gloss over the remaining three games of my trip as we are whitewashed at home by the Oakland A's - marking the lowest point of any overseas mission I have made to watch baseball. After I leave, the Blue Jays go on the road and sweep the Texas Rangers and the same inconsistency continues to dog our season. But then, unpredictability is part of baseball's appeal - any side, on their day, can beat the Yankees (who I hate with every bone in my body).</p> <p>Yes, the sport has its flaws. It is, of course, still trying to find real solutions to a serious steroid problem. Personally, I could do without the marketing during every break in play (Eat pizza! Use this razor! Drive this car! Drink this beer! Now, God damn it! All at the same time!). And the sheer weight of games means some midweek match-ups are attended by no more than the most obsessive fans, and can seem like an afterthought.</p> <p>What is even more disturbing is that George W Bush, in a recent interview, named Roy Halladay as his favourite player. Still, even with the dubious ignominy of wholeheartedly agreeing with an opinion held by Dubya, I am happy to be a fool in love with baseball. I get butterflies before first pitch, I swoon over strikeouts and I go weak at the knees when it's going ... going ... going ... gone.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Major League regular season finishes on 28 September, before the top teams progress to the play-offs and then the World Series, which starts on 22 October.

  "<p>Hurricane Gustav strengthened to a major category 4 storm as it hit Cuba today, on course to hit the US Gulf coast three years after Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>The storm knocked power out in many parts of Cuba's capital, Havana, as 150mph winds blasted rain sideways though the streets. Cuban state television announced that all buses and trains to and from Havana will be suspended until further notice.</p> <p>Whilst Cuba raced to evacuate more than 240,000 people, the main roads leading out of New Orleans were filling up with traffic as residents tried to escape the path of the oncoming storm. </p> <p>\"If it continues on its current path we will start the mandatory evacuation process first thing in the morning at 8am (1300 GMT),\" the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, told reporters at City Hall. \"We will make the call for the definitive mandatory evacuation.\" </p> <p>So far, city officials have evacuated 1,200 people by bus and 1,500 people by train, Nagin said. About 20,000 residents have registered with the city to be evacuated from 17 pick-up points across the city, he said. </p> <p>Earlier today the US National Hurricane Center in Miami called the storm dangerous and said it had reached the status of a major hurricane, the second of this Atlantic season after Bertha in July.</p> <p>Gustav, which killed 78 people in the Caribbean, rolled over the Cayman Islands on Friday with fierce winds that tore down trees and power lines. It is expected to head into the Gulf of Mexico by tomorrow.</p> <p>Gustav first struck Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, the smaller eastern-most 'Sister Islands' in the chain. Storm surge and heavy rains flooded the streets. </p> <p>More than 1,100 people were in government shelters as high waves and heavy winds battered the chain of islands. No injuries were reported. </p> <p>\"We're just trying to wait it out,\" said Juliana O'Connor-Connolly, who represents the islands in the Cayman legislature.</p> <p>She said about 40 people were riding out the storm in her farm on Cayman Brac, which at 65-feet elevation is safe from flooding but still vulnerable to winds that ripped out hundreds of fruit trees on the farm. </p> <p>By 5am EDT today, Gustav was centered about 255 miles east-southeast of the western tip of Cuba and moving north-west.</p> <p>Caymans authorities did not impose a curfew but urged people to remain indoors to avoid interfering with emergency workers. </p> <p>Hotels asked guests to leave and, after the airport closed, prepared to shelter those who remained. </p> <p>Chris Smith, of Frederick, Maryland, said his hotel handed out wrist bands marked with guests' names and room numbers so that \"if something happens they can quickly identify us\".<br> The storm killed four people in a day-long march across the length of Jamaica, where it ripped off roofs and downed power lines. About 4,000 people were displaced from their homes, with about half of them relocated to shelters.</p> <p>The Jamaican prime minister, Bruce Golding, said the government sent helicopters Friday to rescue 31 people trapped by floods. </p> <p>At least 59 people died in Haiti and eight in the Dominican Republic.</p> <p>Gustav could strike the US Gulf coast anywhere from the Florida Panhandle to Texas, but forecasters said there is a great chance that New Orleans will get hit by winds of at least tropical-storm force.</p> <p>As much as 80% of the Gulf of Mexico's oil and gas production could be shut down as a precaution if Gustav enters as a major storm, weather research firm Planalytics said. Oil companies have already evacuated hundreds of workers from offshore platforms. </p> <p>Retail petrol prices rose in the US yesterday for the first time in 43 days as analysts warned that a direct hit on Gulf energy infrastructure could send pump prices hurtling toward $5 per gallon. </p> <p>Crude oil prices ended slightly lower after a volatile session, as some traders feared supply disruptions and others bet the US government will release supplies from its petroleum reserve. </p> <p>Along the US Gulf coast, most commemorations of the Katrina anniversary were canceled because of Gustav, but in New Orleans a horse-drawn carriage took the bodies of Katrina's last seven unclaimed victims to burial.</p> <p>The US president, George Bush, declared a state of emergency in Louisiana, a move that allows the federal government to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance in storm-affected areas.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Portsmouth</strong> got their first goals and first points of the new season with an impressive 3-0 win at <strong>Everton</strong>. Harry Redknapp's side came into the game lying bottom of the table after their opening two fixtures, but with the Peter Crouch-Jermain Defoe partnership showing signs of fruition they were too strong for a disappointing Everton.</p> <p>Portsmouth took the lead in the 12th minute as Defoe latched on to a Crouch flick-on, turned Joleon Lescott and finished from 10 yards. David James was required to be at his best when he saved from Mikael Arteta before the visitors doubled their lead five minutes before half-time. Lassana Diarra found Glen Johnson who played a neat one-two with Defoe before calmly sliding the ball past Tim Howard. </p> <p>Everton had a chance to get back in the game when they were awarded a penalty at the start of the second-half, but even from 12 yards they could find no way past James, who brilliantly saved Aiyegbeni Yakubu's spot-kick. </p> <p>Portsmouth made the game safe in the 68th minute and again it was Defoe on the scoresheet. The England international picked up a pass from Sean Davis and chipped Howard to score his second and Portsmouth's third. </p> <p>The <strong>West Ham United</strong> manager Alan Curbishley was thankful for Paul Ince's return to Upton Park to take the pressure off his shoulders, and after seeing his side overcome <strong>Blackburn Rovers</strong> 4-1 Curbishley must be wishing Ince could return every week. </p> <p>West Ham began slowly against a fired-up Blackburn, but the home side took the lead against the run of play in the 12th minute as Julian Faubert's free-kick was met by Calum Davenport who headed past Paul Robinson in the Blackburn goal. Curbishley's side then doubled their lead just eight minutes later when Mark Noble's shot was deflected past Robinson by Christopher Samba.</p> <p>Blackburn got back in the game two minutes later when Jason Roberts turned Davenport and slotted past Robert Green for his second goal of the season. Ince's side could have been level before half-time when Matt Derbyshire wrongly had a goal disallowed for offside, and again could have equalised shortly after half-time when they were awarded a penalty, but Green produced a stunning save low to his left to deny Roberts. </p> <p>Blackburn thoroughly dominated the second half as they pushed for an equaliser, but somehow couldn't find the breakthrough. West Ham made the game safe with two goals in injury-time, first through the substitute Craig Bellamy before Carlton Cole added a fourth. </p> <p>The last time <strong>Hull City</strong> and <strong>Wigan Athletic</strong> met in a league match was in League Two in 1996 in front of 3,500 people at Boothferry Park. It was a different story at the KC Stadium as they renewed a rivalry more traditionally associated with rugby league. </p> <p>The visitors took the lead in the fifth minute when Kevin Kilbane's inswinging corner was put into his own net by Sam Ricketts. Emile Heskey and Amr Zaki were causing all sorts of problems for Phil Brown's side, and Wigan doubled their lead after 13 minutes. The Egyptian striker Zaki found Antonio Valencia who sprinted half the length of the pitch to score.</p> <p>Steve Bruce's side wrapped up the game 20 minutes into the second half when Valencia found Zaki, who shifted the ball to his left-foot before firing in his third goal of the season. Heskey made it four in the 68th minute, latching onto a hopeful punt from Chris Kirkland, and registered his first goal of the season. Bruce's decision to sign Zaki is looking inspired as the Egyptian registered his second of the game when he fired in off the bar with nine remaining to cap a magnificent 5-0 win for Wigan.</p> <p><strong>Middlesbrough</strong> maintained their impressive start to the new season with a 2-1 win over <strong>Stoke City</strong> at the Riverside. The visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 36th minute when Amdy Faye was shown a straight red card by the referee Mike Dean for a high challenge. Afonso Alves struck an unstoppable shot past Thomas Sorensen in the Stoke goal from the resulting free kick. </p> <p>The home side had the chance to make the game safe from the penalty spot halfway through the second half, but Stewart Downing saw his spot-kick come back off the crossbar. They were made to pay moments later when Justin Hoyte, making his home league debut, bundled a Liam Lawrence cross into his own net. </p> <p>The Turkish international Tuncay Sanli won the game for Gareth Southgate's team with five minutes remaining when he beat the Stoke offside trap and shot past Sorensen as the Stoke defence waited for the referee's whistle. </p> <p><strong>West Bromwich Albion</strong> should have taken all three points at the Reebok against <strong>Bolton Wanderers</strong>, but had to make do with a 0-0 draw. The home side had goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen to thank for their point, as the Finnish international saved from James Morrison and twice from Ishmael Miller, who should have have won the game for the visitors. Bolton nearly snatched all three points when Kevin Davies twice had the ball in the net in the final five minutes, but both efforts were correctly ruled out for offside.</p>",
  "<h2>Three ways to use pegs</h2> <p>There are loads of ways you can use pegs! We've thought of three things to do with them \u2014 can you think of anymore?</p> <p><strong>1 Play a peg hunting game</strong></p> <p><strong>Rules</strong></p> <p>1 You need two players/two teams and at least five different coloured pegs. Give each peg a points value (eg five for the red peg, four for the yellow one three, and so on). If you want to make the game easier, use brightly coloured pegs; if you want to make it harder, paint wooden ones to blend into the surroundings. Take another peg and paint it gold \u2014 this will be worth 10 points.<br>2 Take it in turns to hide the pegs \u2014 the person who is hiding them can make the game more interesting by writing clues on scraps of paper and placing them around the house or garden (again, using pegs!). The other player/team has 10 minutes to find as many pegs as they can, and by doing this, gain more points.<br>3 The player/team with the most points at the end of the game \u2014 it can be a short (hide the pegs once each) or long game (hide them five times each) is the winner. </p> <p><strong>2 Make a pegasaurus</strong></p> <p><strong>You will need</strong><br>\u2022 Four toilet roll tubes <br>\u2022 Paperclips<br>\u2022 Scissors<br>\u2022 Pegs <br>\u2022 Paint and pens</p> <p>1 Attach three toilet rolls together using paperclips: this will become your dinosaur's body. Cut all the way down the top toilet roll, as indicated.<br>2 Cut your fourth toilet in half lengthways and flatten it out. Cut a rectangle from this piece of card \u00ad\u2014 this needs to be about 2mm longer than the length of a toilet roll. Insert this into the cut you made in step one. Cut another length of toilet roll and fold it in half. Attach with paperclips to make your pegasaurus's head.<br>3 Paint the toilet rolls: if you're trying to make a realistic-looking dinosaur, go for green. Otherwise, you could make your pegasaurus pink, purple, blue, or even red with yellow spots! If you are using wooden pegs, paint these too.<br>4 Now you're ready to start attaching the pegs! To make the spine, add as many or as few as you want to the rectangle of card you made in step two. To make legs, attach a peg horizontally to the toilet roll, and then add a peg vertically to that one.<br>5 Add final details to your dinosaur with paint and pens. If you get bored with how your pegasaurus looks, you can always give it a makeover by using different pegs!</p> <p><strong>3 Make a peg tree desk tidy</strong></p> <p><strong>You will need</strong><br>\u2022 One kitchen roll tube<br>\u2022 One toilet roll tube<br>\u2022 Cardboard<br>\u2022 Sticky tape<br>\u2022 Pegs <br>\u2022 Paint, glitter, or anything else to use for decoration</p> <p>1 Decorate your kitchen roll tube and toilet roll tube.<br>2 Cut out a rectangle of thick cardboard: this will be the base. Use sticky tape to attach the two cardboard tubes to the base. Again, decorate this.<br>3 Attach pegs to top of the kitchen roll tube to create branches. You could make different coloured branches for different people in your house, or to hold different types of things.<br>4 Fill the toilet roll tube with pens (you never know when you might need to write a note and put it on your peg tree!) and you're ready to start using your new desk tidy.</p> <h2>Five tiny things to do today</h2> <p>1. Take 10 minutes to drink a glass of water, without letting the glass leave your lips <br>2. Draw the best present you can think of, then give your \u00addrawing to a friend<br>3. Find out five facts about cows <br>4. Think of 10 uses for a roll of sticky tape<br>5. Make an instrument from \u00adsomething you'd find in the bathroom. </p> <h2>Evolving pavement art</h2> <p><strong>Step one</strong></p> <p>Choose a paving slab or brick on the floor and decorate it with chalk \u2014 you could draw a landscape on it or just fill the space with different patterns. Take a photo.</p> <p><strong>Step one</strong></p> <p>Return to your piece of art a few hours later and take note of how it has changed. Has it rained? Have people been walking over it? Write a few notes about how your picture has evolved and take another photo. Go back to your picture every few hours; keep taking photos and writing notes.</p> <p><strong>Step three</strong></p> <p>When your picture has finally disappeared, make a collage of the photos you took and the notes you made. </p> <h2>The Joker</h2> <p><strong>Why are vampires artistic?</strong> </p> <p>Because they are good at drawing blood!</p> <p><strong>What do you call a dinosaur fossil that doesn't want to work?</strong></p> <p>Lazy bones!</p>",
  "<p>In one of Barack Obama's biggest applause lines <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/08/29/MNU212KB7R.DTL\">in Denver on Thursday</a>, he said John McCain had voted with George Bush \"90% of the time\" and warned, \"I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.\"</p> <p>Now McCain has made his vice presidential pick, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSN2940588620080829\">Alaska governor Sarah Palin</a>, it ensures with something approaching 100% certitude that America is about to get one kind of change that Democrats have been pushing for years now.</p> <p>When George Bush leaves the White House, America will have its first black president or its first female vice president, and - given McCain's advanced age and Palin's youth and vigour - possibly its first female president as well. Diversity indeed.</p> <p>At their <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/us/politics/29text-palin.html\">public announcement in Ohio</a>, the Republicans played the gender card for all it was worth. McCain said that he was \"especially proud\" to be announcing this decision during the week that \"we celebrate the anniversary of women's suffrage.\"</p> <p>Palin, for her part, noted that the announcement came \"88 years almost to the day after the women of America first earned the right to vote.\" She braved boos from this mostly Republican audience by praising Hillary Clinton's \"determination and grace\".</p> <p>The Alaska governor continued: \"It was rightly noted in Denver this week that Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America, but it turns out the women of the America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.\"</p> <p>What does Palin bring to the ticket?</p> <p><strong>Youth:</strong> She's two years younger than Barack Obama and about a thousand years younger than McCain.</p> <p><strong>A woman's touch:</strong> The McCain campaign believes she can help peel off disaffected, middle-aged women who supported Clinton in the primaries.</p> <p><strong>Beauty:</strong> Late, Late Show host Craig Ferguson said that she gives off a \"naughty librarian vibe\" and more than a few male voters (of all ages) may appreciate that.</p> <p><strong>Pro-lifery:</strong> Palin is a member of <a href=\"http://feministsforlife.org/news/ffl-member-sarah-palin-vp.htm\">Feminists for Life</a> and just this year gave birth to a boy with Down Syndrome. Try arguing with that one, Joe Biden.</p> <p><strong>Biography:</strong> She cleverly but not inaccurately calls herself a \"hockey mom\" of five whose involvement in the PTA drew her into politics.</p> <p><strong>Reformist cred:</strong> McCain and company railed against the \"bridges to nowhere\" that Alaska's ethics-challenged delegation had secured funding for. It was governor Palin who made sure money for the bridges was spent on other, less objectionable projects. She ran for mayor of Wasilla on the promise to lower her own salary once in office - and did so.</p> <p><strong>Oil:</strong> Palin is very pro-drilling in the ANWR oil reserve and at the same time has a history of tangling with Big Oil as ethics commissioner of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and then as governor, giving her more credibility to make the case. That hit John McCain's sweet spot.</p> <p>There is, of course, a lot that Palin doesn't bring to the ticket. Her state is not likely to give its whopping three Electoral College votes to Democrats. She is fairly green, currently in the middle of serving her first term as governor. She has no experience in national politics or foreign policy.</p> <p>McCain picked her for tokenism and for a more interesting reason. Obama seems to believe that \"change\" simply means more government coupled with an increasing willingness of citizens to shoulder more responsibilities - we should pay more, work harder, and be happy about this. Thus McCain can't ever really be an agent of change.</p> <p>But there are duelling versions of reform. Obama wants to assign government a much larger role as \"our brother's keeper.\" McCain now claims to represent a more centre-right reformist tradition.</p> <p>The Republican is not anti-government but he is skeptical that more government is part of the answer to all of life's problems, and he's expressed a willingness to rethink some of his government's current commitments (though not, alas, in Iraq). He's picked the little-known Alaska governor to send the message that he means it.</p>",
  "<p>At least 20 people have died after an overcrowded rescue boat capsized in flood-ravaged parts of northern India.</p> <p>Officials said the situation was worsening because of heavy rains and a greater discharge of water from neighboring Nepal.</p> <p>The rescue boat capsized last night in Madhepura district, 95 miles north-east of Patna, the capital of impoverished Bihar state.</p> <p>\"The boat was overcrowded because people panicked to be rescued and clambered on board,\" said police superintendent O N Bhaskar. </p> <p>Eight people swam to safety and 32 were rescued by army troops, he said.</p> <p>An army rescue worker was among those killed.</p> <p>The death toll from this year's monsoon season across India has climbed past 800. Some 1.2 million people have been marooned and about 2 million more affected in Bihar, where the Kosi river has burst its banks and submerged all roads leading to the region. </p> <p>Rising waters have swept away and drowned at least 75 people in Bihar since the start of the monsoon season in June, said Prataya Amrit, secretary of the state's disaster management department.</p> <p>Aid agencies claim the Indian government is playing down the scale of the disaster and not taking into account thousands of people who they say are missing after the Bihar floods.</p> <p>India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has described the situation as a national calamity. </p> <p>Authorities have rescued nearly 140,000 people and put most of them in state-run relief camps, Amrit said.</p> <p>The situation was getting worse because of heavy rains in the region and the breach in the embankment in the Kosi river that is swelling on the Nepalese side.</p> <p>\"We can't assess the extent of the damage. It is colossal,\" Amrit said. \"But we will only be able to tell the extent after the water recedes.\" </p> <p>The Indian government has made available more than $200m (\u00a3110m) to combat monsoon flooding. </p> <p>Almost 1,500 soldiers have boosted rescue efforts in Bihar state with air force helicopters dropping food to hundreds of thousand of people stranded by the rampaging river. </p> <p>India's monsoon season, which lasts from June to September, brings rain vital for the country's farmers but often also causes massive destruction. </p> <p>Despite rescue operations, officials in Bihar have warned that the real danger is still ahead. </p> <p>When the swollen Kosi river burst its banks in Nepal just north of the Indian border, it changed course, flowing through a fresh channel 75 miles to the east that has no protective embankments. </p> <p>The river traditionally swells to a flood peak in October. </p> <p>In 2007, monsoon floods killed more than 2,200 people across south Asia and left 31 million homeless, short of food or with other problems. The UN called last year's floods the worst in living memory.</p>"
