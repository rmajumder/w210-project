  "<h2>What happened when The Observer's Laura Potter attempted to find the ingredients and cook a dish from the Blumenthal cookbook ...</h2> <p>Should I go for the bacon and egg ice-cream? Pah, which of us hasn't cooked a recipe containing 24 egg yolks? I plumped instead for a maltodextrin DE19-infused sardine on toast sorbet. </p> <p>First stop: Tesco. Sardines: check. Milk: check. Maltodextrin DE19: hmm. I scoured the 'home baking' aisle to no avail. Google had informed me this elusive ingredient was a 'sweet to taste hygroscopic powder ... creamy white in colour' created by the 'partial hydrolysis of starch'. A tub of rice pudding it is, then. Next testing ingredient: malic acid. Turns out this is nothing more than an alias for E296, so I substituted a bag of strawberry laces - malic acid does, after all, feature ninth in their ingredients list. </p> <p>The cooking was surprisingly hassle-free but rancid smelling. It took an hour and a quarter of toasting, soaking, simmering and blitzing to create what looked like a sardine smoothie. I guessed how many melted strawberry laces would achieve the prescribed PH 5.6. The proof would be in the tasting. </p> <p>Next morning my housemate begrudgingly accepted the challenge. Her verdict: 'Putrid.' After reaching for something, anything, to banish the taste from her palate, she asked the all-important question 'when the hell are you supposed to eat that stuff?' </p> <p>Well, Heston? I'm unsure our friendship will recover; what I am sure of is that I won't be adding The Big Fat Duck Cookbook to my Christmas list.<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/oct/04/foodanddrink.hestonblumenthal\"><br>Food blog: Who will buy Heston's weighty tome?</a></p>",
  "<h2>Davies in line to net new job</h2> <p>Tristan Davies, the talented former Independent on Sunday editor, is in the running for a new job - Sunday Times online editor. Davies, who oversaw the Sunday Times' redesign earlier this year, is said to be under consideration for the post, created after News International shuffled its website executives. This happened following the appointment of Times Online editor-in-chief Anne Spackman as comment editor of the Times last week. </p> <h2>Sun raises eyebrows</h2> <p>Last week, the Sun claimed David Cameron, who went for early morning jogs at The Tory conference in Birmingham, upset a member of the public by running too close to her. 'The woman lifted a hand as if to say \"back off\",' it reported. 'Cameron raised an eyebrow and trotted on by.' Perhaps the raised eyebrow was a gesture of recognition rather than reproach; the woman was a member of Cameron's press team, who was gesturing to photographers to move out of her boss's path. </p> <h2>A bit of a boob</h2> <p>A mix-up at a distribution company on Friday meant Radio 4's Today programme received Capital Radio's morning papers, while Capital's Johnny Vaughan was handed Today's delivery. That left John Humphrys et al leafing through Closer and Heat, but if there was a discussion on the size of Jordan's assets, we must have been asleep at the time.</p> <h2>What are the odds?</h2> <p>The Daily Mail was forced to take down its gambling website, www.mailbingo.com, briefly last year after The Observer revealed that it didn't contain the customary advice on gambling addiction. Now the paper is running prominent ads for its revamped site in the Mail without publishing the address of advice group gambleaware.co.uk alongside it, in apparent defiance of industry etiquette. Tut tut. </p> <h2>On the couch</h2> <p>In his barely anticipated new book, Sky political editor Adam Boulton, pictured, recalls the resignation of Tony Blair, noting with distaste that the former PM chose to reveal the timing of his departure on 'the least combative and most inconsequential forum he could find' - the GMTV sofa. Boulton, a former TV-am reporter, makes this observation in his tome about the Blair years, a free copy of which was sent to the offices of the uncombative and 'inconsequential' GMTV last week. </p> <h2>Did I mention the advert?</h2> <p>The current edition of Private Eye carries a spoof poem 'by' Felix Dennis, the gregarious publishing magnate turned poet (page 18) which includes the line 'don't mention the free wine (or murder)'. Did editors know the Eye was also running a full-page ad for Dennis's forthcoming poetry book tour, 'Did I mention the free wine?' (page 31)?</p> <h2>TV loses its fizz</h2> <p>ITV's party at the Tory conference came as it announced swingeing job cuts - so full marks to the bright spark who, at the last second, swapped the free champagne on offer for white wine. The champers is also on ice at the BBC, after accountants discovered it spent \u00a350,000 on bottles of bubbly for award-winning staff last year. They will now receive a 'well done' card instead.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 7 2008. Tristan Davies oversaw the Sunday Times' redesign earlier this year, not the Independent on Sunday's. This has been corrected</p>",
  "<p>If you want to put on a stone (6.3kg) in weight, this is the cookbook for you. Retailing at an astonishing \u00a3100, Heston Blumenthal's lavish new volume of recipes registers more than 12lb on the bathroom scales. And that is without its silver, duck feather-embossed box.</p> <p>What may be the most exclusive cookbook ever produced goes on sale this month, featuring 516 pages of fabulously photographed, jewel-like dishes that bear as much relation to the cuisine of the nation as Vivienne Westwood's clothes do to those on the rails at Next. These are not recipes for those with a modest galley kitchen either, since the book is almost as wide as a standard-sized hob. </p> <p>According to members of the public who were among the first to look into the tome's mysteries this weekend, Blumenthal, who is famed for his outr\u00e9 experiments with the scent and sound of eating, needs to wake up and smell the coffee. Its esoteric contents are best summed up by one bemused woman who, after flicking through the first edition, wondered: 'Where would you get 250g of spinalis dorsi?'</p> <p>Yet the book is arguably a democratic move from Britain's most avant-garde gastronome. For \u00a3100 you can sample at home the food on the menu at the restaurant that is repeatedly judged the best in Britain, The Fat Duck at Bray in Berkshire. This is a fraction of the cost of an average bill at Blumenthal's triple-Michelin-starred headquarters, famed for its 18-course tasting menu. Perhaps it is a bargain then, assuming that your kitchen is already equipped with an atomiser, a vacuum chamber and a laboratory-style centrifuge. </p> <p>Before Blumenthal opened the Fat Duck in 1995, he had spent only one week working at Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, but his extraordinary culinary theories have swept the country. In 2004 he opened his own research and development kitchen, pursuing the kind of alchemy behind two of his trademark dishes, smoked bacon and egg ice-cream and snail porridge. His concentration on extracting intense flavours from his ingredients, however long and arduous the procedures involved, has seen him dubbed 'the emperor of molecular gastronomy'. For scientific know-how at the stove, he is rivalled only by his friend Ferran Adri\u00e0 of the renowned El Bulli restaurant in Spain.</p> <p>At a time when celebrity chefs are identified, much like rock stars, by their first names alone, Heston's magnum opus will be up against new recipe books from Nigella, Jamie, Rick and Gary this Christmas. But while all his competitors' titles will have high production values, Blumenthal's qualifies as a piece of conceptual art. You would not want to accidentally drip it with glucose syrup or Sicilian mandarin essential oil.</p> <p>Among the other unlikely ingredients listed in the book are spray-dried carrot powder, maltodextrin DE19, yellow pectin and golden frankincense tears for making reserved frankincense hydrosol.</p> <p>So that's the science part over, though Blumenthal would probably claim its importance has been over-emphasised by his critics. Two years ago he launched a manifesto in collaboration with Adri\u00e0 and a third top international chef, Thomas Keller, to try to clarify his key principles. The point of his work, he said, is not the technical wizardry itself but the search for flavour. 'The danger is that technology overtakes the value of the dish,' Blumenthal said.</p> <p>The 42-year-old cook argues that evoking the nostalgia of early taste experiences is crucial to enjoying food. The new book explains how he developed a vegetable dish that reminded him of childhood breakfasts.</p> <p>'We began crystallising pieces of parsnip to make them look like a breakfast cereal that could be served with a jug of parsnip milk,' he writes.</p> <p>Truly more like a coffee table than a coffee table book, this publication is not a practical aid for the busy cook.</p> <p>'It could be much smaller and have an additional book, with all the design material,' said Nicola Daniel, 29, an undergraduate course officer from Wembley, north-west London. 'Why would you buy such a huge book for such a huge price?'</p> <p>Robin Syred, 29, an office manager from Balham, south London, agreed about the size. 'You wouldn't want to get it messy,' he added.</p> <p>Mohamed El Sayed, 42, a chef from Archway, north London, and his fellow chef, 39-year-old Dominique Ait El Manceur from Charlton, south-east London, both agreed it was impractical. 'It looks like a nice encyclopaedia,' said El Manceur. Curator Eline van der Vlist, the woman who wondered where she would find spinalis dorsi, thought the cookbook looked more like an art catalogue.</p> <p>Jamie Gavin, 25, a press analyst from Islington, north London, said: 'It is very aesthetically pleasing and the book is a commodity in itself, but you could get the same information on the internet for free. It is too expensive.'</p> <p>Even with his hot temper and reported love of kickboxing, Blumenthal will now find it hard to control the free exchange of his kitchen secrets. A cheap click of the mouse is going to appeal to many of his fans more than the thought of paying \u00a3100 to lug home The Big Fat Duck Cookbook. In fact, since the chef is thought to have been forced to give up his favourite sport after a back operation, it is probably best if even he doesn't try to pick it up without some help.</p> <p>\u2022 Heston Blumenthal's <strong>The Big Fat Duck Cookbook</strong> is published by Bloomsbury, price \u00a3100.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/oct/04/foodanddrink.hestonblumenthal\">Food blog: Who will buy Heston's weighty tome?<br></a></p>",
  "<p>If the Scottish clubs' performances in Europe this season are transferred to the national team, reports of Saturday's vital World Cup qualifier against Norway at Hampden Park will probably have to be displayed within a black border.</p> <p>Among the four representatives on the continent, 10 matches have been played without yielding a victory. The depth of the misery may be measured by the fact that Queen of the South from the First Division - their entry to the Uefa Cup qualifying stage earned as Scottish Cup runners-up to Rangers - are the country's leading scorers, with two of the pathetic aggregate of three goals.</p> <p>Celtic's 0-0 draw with Aalborg in their Champions League Group E opener was followed by last Tuesday's 1-0 defeat by Villarreal in Spain, a fixture in which the Parkhead side's resistance may have been much more creditable than most expected, but was insufficient to remove at least a little of the tarnish from the national image.</p> <p>Those who thought that Rangers' capitulation to FBK Kaunas of Lithuania at the qualifying stage of the Champions League would be the nadir of the country's efforts abroad had not allowed for Motherwell's comprehensive beating by AS Nancy in the first round of the Uefa Cup or for the prospect of Celtic finishing bottom of their group.</p> <p>Having reached the last 16 of the tournament in each of the past two seasons Gordon Strachan's team were accompanied into the current campaign with expectations of another telling challenge for a top-two placing.</p> <p>With the double-header against Manchester United looming on 21 October and 5 November, there is every possibility that they will require at least a score draw from their visit to Aalborg next month to remain ahead of the Danish champions and take the consolation prize of qualification for the knockout stage of the Uefa Cup.</p> <p>The majority of the Hampden crowd next weekend, however, will be encouraged by the fact that Scotland have already surpassed the clubs by winning a match, the 2-1 defeat of Iceland in Reykjavik last month helping to reduce the pain of their opening loss to Macedonia in Skopje four days earlier. That Norway should have been held to a 2-2 home draw by Iceland on their first outing is another reason for optimism.</p> <p>George Burley, the Scotland manager, has too much respect for his counterpart, Age Hareide - a friend and former East Anglian rival when a Norwich player while the Scot was at Ipswich - and enough awareness of his own squad's limitations to indulge in bravado, but there was no missing his confidence as he discussed the prospect of putting daylight between himself and Hareide before the away match against Holland in March.</p> <p>'The Norwegians are tall and physically strong, as you would expect,' said Burley, 'but height is something we're used to coping with. There is a possibility that the match will be more like a British cup tie than the usual World Cup game, but we have our own style and we will concentrate on that. We have skilful players who can take opponents on and go past them and our game is more about accurate, short passing and good movement.</p> <p>'Results haven't been as kind to Norway in recent years as they once were and they have been unconvincing defensively, as we saw in their draw with Iceland. We would like to believe we can exploit that. But they also play a diamond in midfield, with Steffen Iversen behind the two strikers, one of whom will certainly be John Carew. It can be a pretty aggressive style, as they showed when Iversen scored both against Iceland.'</p> <p>Carew and Iversen, with 146 caps between them, are challenged in experience only by the 73 appearances of John Arne Riise, the former Liverpool left-back now with Roma. All three are capable of inflicting damage on any defence that loses concentration, but Burley insists that the trio will not be isolated for special attention.</p> <p>With James McFadden and Kenny Miller the likely attacking pair and a midfield quartet - probably Darren Fletcher, Scott Brown, Barry Robson and Shaun Maloney - encouraged to play in forward areas, Burley said the intention is to put Norway on the defensive. </p> <p>'Cutting off the supply to Carew will obviously be our aim when they have the ball,' said Burley. 'But we will be more concentrated on imposing our style, keeping them preoccupied at the back. It is a big occasion for both sides, as we consider each other as rivals for one of the top two places.'</p>",
  "<p>In one photograph a young boy, his arms spread as if in supplication, gazes listlessly at the ceiling as a woman - his mother, we presume - cradles him tenderly in her arms. In another, a grey-haired man attached to an oxygen cylinder sits cross-legged on a hospital bed staring vacantly into the middle distance. In two further pictures we encounter similar expressions, this time in the eyes of a man bundled up in bed taking his meds and a baby framed against the film of a chest X-ray occluded by ghostly white shadows.</p> <p>The child in the first picture is Chan Thai, a 12-year-old from Svay Reing in Cambodia. He is pictured in the throes of tuberculosis meningitis, a disease that should no longer afflict children in this century. The names of the others have not been recorded, but whether from India or Lesotho, Swaziland or Siberia, they too are victims of TB, a disease now re-emerging in a deadly new form with devastating consequences in villages, shanty towns and cities across the globe.</p> <p>'Tuberculosis is a shocking disease,' explains James Nachtwey, the American war photographer behind these extraordinary images. 'I'm a very experienced journalist. I've seen a lot of terrible things in this world, but witnessing TB is something that affected me as profoundly as anything I saw in Iraq or Afghanistan. My heart went out to the victims and when people see these photographs I hope their hearts will go out to them, too.'</p> <p>Starting this weekend, Nachtwey will get his wish when TED, a New York-based organisation that brings together leading scientists, thinkers and designers committed to social change, begins exhibiting his photographs in galleries around the world. The brainchild of Chris Anderson, a former magazine entrepreneur, TED grants $100,000 to three outstanding people each year and gives them 'one wish to change the world'. Nachtwey's was to use his skills as a photojournalist to raise global awareness of 'extensively drug resistant tuberculosis' (XDR-TB for short) and in the process demonstrate the power of news photography in the digital age.</p> <p>With TED's funding, Nachtwey travelled to countries as diverse as Cambodia, Siberia, Rwanda and India, documenting the depredations of XDR-TB and the efforts of governments and NGOs to pioneer new treatment programmes that may arrest the disease's progression. On Friday, TED unveiled a slide show of more than 50 of Nachtwey's images at the Lincoln Center in New York and the National Theatre in London. Over the next few weeks the same photographs will be shown on outdoor screens in 50 cities worldwide and on the internet as part of a multimedia campaign that aims to harness the power of the web and 'viral marketing' techniques. At the same time the UK think-tank Demos will exhibit Nachtwey's photographs in a gallery in Brick Lane, east London, renamed the Emergency Room.</p> <p>Nachtwey's aim is to bring TB more into the 'mass consciousness,' in the hope of kick-starting an action campaign that can leverage more funds for aid. 'The problem at the moment is that very few people in the West are even conscious of TB,' he says. 'The more people are aware of it, the easier it is to raise funds and get sponsorship for research.'</p> <p>Tuberculosis is one of the oldest diseases known to man and certainly one of the deadliest. Evidence of tuberculosis has been found in the skeletons of Egyptian mummies and in an Iron Age settlement in Dorset. Scientists estimate that in the past 400 years TB has killed some 2bn people worldwide, and disfigured, crippled and blinded countless more. It is not for nothing that the 17th-century English writer and preacher John Bunyan called TB 'the captain of all these men of death'.</p> <p>Spread like the common cold or flu by coughing and sneezing, the tubercle bacillus most commonly infects the lungs, slowly eating away at the spongy tissue essential for respiration and forming abscesses that discharge foul-smelling pus. However, the microbe spares no part of the human body and can also spill into the digestive tract, causing ulcerations of the throat and bloody diarrhoea, or into the bloodstream where it causes a condition known as milliary tuberculosis that can prove fatal to the kidneys, heart and other organs. If it crosses the blood-brain barrier, TB can also cause meningitis, coma and death.</p> <p>More usually, however, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a seductively slow assassin. Hippocrates labelled the disease phthisis - from the Greek term for 'wasting' - because of the way that patients under its influence seemed to gradually wither away, and even after Robert Koch's groundbreaking isolation of the bacillus in 1882 doctors continued to refer to TB as 'consumption' well into the Twenties. At the height of the disease's prevalence in the 18th and 19th centuries it claimed the lives of as many as 100,000 Britons every year. Prominent victims included John Keats, Emily Bront\u00eb and Robert Louis Stevenson - associations that gave it an aura of romance and poetry. However, for anyone who has witnessed the disease at close hand, there is nothing romantic about TB, and today it is back with a vengeance.</p> <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that every year TB kills 1.6m people - or one person every 18 seconds (by contrast, malaria is responsible for some 1m deaths worldwide, or roughly one person every 30 seconds). Although that is still short of the annual death toll from HIV/Aids (between 1.8m and 2.3m), separating the two diseases increasingly makes little sense. 'If there's a high population with HIV, then people are much more susceptible to the disease,' explains Nachtwey.</p> <p>Born in Syracuse, New York, Nachtwey made his name as a witness to some of the world's bloodiest and most intractable conflicts. A five- times winner of the Robert Capa Gold Medal, he covered the Troubles in Northern Ireland in the early Eighties, the Serb invasion of Kosovo in 1999 and countless other war and famine zones from Bosnia to the Sudan. In 2003 Nachtwey was on assignment with a US Army platoon in Iraq when an insurgent tossed a grenade into his Humvee. The grenade severed the hand of one of his journalistic colleagues, but Nachtwey still had the wherewithal to photograph the medics who came to their rescue before he passed out.</p> <p>He first became interested in TB in 2000 when Time magazine sent him to South Africa to cover Aids. The government was still in denial over the scale of the epidemic, but visiting villages and wards where people with HIV were sent for 'treatment for TB', it soon became obvious that the two diseases were linked and the problem was growing.</p> <p>Then, in 2003, the Cambodian Health Committee (CHC), an independent NGO that is the brainchild of Harvard infectious disease expert Dr Anne Goldfeld and a former Cambodian refugee worker Dr Sok Thim, invited Nachtwey to document their in-country treatment programme. Nachtwey travelled with Thim to Svay Reing, delivering drugs to remote rural areas and going on house visits. It was during one of these visits that he photographed a 12-year-old peasant boy who had just lost his mother to TB. Nachtwey arrived just as the boy, dressed in Buddhist robes, was preparing to lead the funeral procession through the paddy fields to the funeral pyre. His photograph of Va Ling, clutching a framed picture of his mother to his chest, is both moving and timeless. Exhibited in 2007 at the United Nations in New York on the occasion of World TB Day, it was this photograph - and the reaction to it - that convinced Nachtwey that a slide show of similarly arresting images could be a means of raising consciousness of TB worldwide.'There are lots of very impressive statistics about TB, but I wanted to put a human face on it.'</p> <p>With TED's help, Nachtwey visited seven countries blighted by XDR-TB, returning to Cambodia and South Africa but also documenting new TB hotspots such as Rwanda, Lesotho, Swaziland and Siberia. </p> <p>An airborne rod-like microbe, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is most commonly transmitted in air droplets when someone coughs or sneezes. The good news is that unlike a cold or flu, TB is not highly contagious - it usually takes several hours of continuous exposure for a sick person to transmit the disease to someone who is healthy. The bad news, however, is that the bacillus can hang around in the atmosphere for weeks or months - much longer than other bacteria - and although 60 per cent of those infected will successfully fight off and destroy an infection, one in three people continues to carry the bacillus in dormant form. The danger is that if their immune system is suddenly compromised or they are infected with HIV, these latent infections may revive.</p> <p>Even so, if TB is diagnosed early, it is eminently treatable, usually with a six- to eight-month course of oral antibiotics. However, if patients fail to complete the prescribed course of treatment, the bacteria may become resistant, meaning doctors have to prescribe other harder-to-tolerate second-line medications, for periods of between one and two years. This in turn makes compliance even harder, resulting in a vicious cycle of rising rates of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and new infections.</p> <p>Resistance to streptomycin, the original TB drug, was first reported in 1948. Since then the bacillus has also bred resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid - the front-line combination therapies recommended by the WHO - as well as to many second-line oral antibiotics and third-line injectable drugs. </p> <p>The result is that last year there were 500,000 new cases of MDR-TB, of which 2 per cent were deemed by the WHO to be XDR-TB and 'virtually untreatable'. Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and Tomsk Oblast in Siberia, which houses a 7,000-strong prison population, were particularly hard hit with some of the highest rates of MDR-TB ever recorded.</p> <p>In South Africa TB is closely linked to rising rates of HIV, whereas in Russia the resurgence of the disease can be traced to the economic dislocation that followed the demise of the Soviet Union. As health and social services collapsed and alcoholism skyrocketed, many people developed TB because their immune systems, weakened by drugs, alcohol and poor nutrition, could no longer keep latent TB in check. During the long, cold Siberian winters, the hallways and unventilated cells of the Tomsk jails also provided ideal conditions for the transmission of the virus, resulting in the prisons becoming an 'epidemiological pump' spreading the disease throughout the general population.</p> <p>As part of his journey Nachtwey visited one of the Tomsk prison colonies. His guide was Partners-in-Health (PIH), a Boston-based NGO founded by Dr Paul Farmer that helps manage treatment programmes inside Siberian prisons, as well as in community settings.</p> <p>When PIH first arrived in the region, the WHO had effectively written off MDR-TB as untreatable. Instead, it was insisting that Russia adopt its directly observed therapy short course (DOTS) treatment programme, despite the fact that in many parts of the country chemists had run out of the oral antibiotics.</p> <p>Armed with a $10m grant from the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria, PIH adopted a different strategy. Beginning in 2000 it encouraged local doctors, first in the prison system and then throughout the region, to treat all cases of MDR-TB aggressively. At around the same time, the WHO agreed to green-light the supply of second-line drugs at sharply reduced prices. The result was that the cost of treating a patient was halved, from around \u00a36,000 to \u00a33,000, and compliance rates shot up. Today, PIH claims its 'DOTS-plus' programme in Siberia is achieving a near 80 per cent cure rate. However, while the deaths from TB are down, drug resistance is still rising - about 15 per cent of new cases according to the latest figures.</p> <p>Despite this setback, Nachtwey insists PIH's programme is a rare success story. 'They've shown that in most cases TB can be cured - you can actually be healed.'</p> <p>Nachtwey was similarly impressed by PIH's facility at a hospital in Maseru, Lesotho, which it runs in partnership with the government and which boasts similar cure rates. And in India, which has the highest number of TB cases of any country in the world, he spent 10 days visiting hospitals and clinics in Mumbai and Chennai, where he found government programmes are also well organised.</p> <p>However, the country he knows best and where he has seen the most marked progress is Cambodia. When Sok Thim and Anne Goldfeld founded the CHC in 1994 the country had some of the highest TB rates in the world. As in Russia, the MDR-TB cases were considered untreatable. Goldfeld and Thim changed all that by offering patients free medication if they signed a contract pledging they would finish their treatment and by getting friends and family to serve as co-guarantors. At the same time CHC negotiated nutritional supplements from the World Food Program, thus reducing the likelihood that patients and their families would go hungry - a key factor in speeding recovery. </p> <p>The result is that CHC has treated 13,000 Cambodians for TB and boasts cure rates as high as 95 per cent. At the same time, Goldfeld, who also runs a biomedical research lab at Harvard, has been able to identify a key susceptibility gene for TB and a unique immune reaction that helps the microbe evade human immune defences - research that may eventually lead to new treatments and vaccines.</p> <p>Now, with the help of the WHO, Goldfeld is negotiating wider access to subsidised drugs and running a trial looking at the best timing for medications for patients with dual TB/HIV infections.</p> <p>'Our programmes show that everyone can be well if you give them the right education and support,' says Goldfeld. 'It doesn't matter if you live in the city or the poorest part of Cambodia. If you get the drugs to people and provide communities with food and other forms of support, TB can be beaten.'</p> <p>However, for all the progress that has been made in Svay Reing, CHC operates on a shoestring and can't be there to treat every patient or prevent every new infection. This is the true tragedy of TB. Sometime between the Twenties (when French researchers first developed the BCG vaccine) and the Fifties (when the vaccine was first given to schoolchildren in Britain and other European countries), the West took its eye off the ball. Thinking that TB had been consigned to the dustbin of medical history, we failed to invest in new drugs or better vaccines that would extend the protection conferred by the BCG to adults in later life. As Paul Farmer, the founder of PIH and a medical anthropologist with years of experience treating TB and other infectious diseases puts it: 'In failing to curb tuberculosis a window of opportunity has been slammed shut. We must acknowledge that our guilt surpasses that of earlier generations who lacked our resources.'</p> <p>Chan Thai is a case in point. Tuberculosis meningitis is extremely rare in the UK thanks to immunisation with the BCG and good child healthcare services. Not so in Cambodia. Nachtwey and Goldfeld first encountered Chan Thai at the local hospital in Svay Reing where his mother had brought him for emergency treatment. One of four children from a farming family, Chan Thai had collapsed suddenly at home with a fever and convulsions. At hospital he was given a spinal tap and a cocktail of antibiotics. Even so, doctors couldn't prevent him suffering further seizures and slipping into a coma. Fortunately, he recovered and was eventually able to return home. </p> <p>Nevertheless, when Nachtwey took his photograph, says Goldfeld, Chan Thai was still clearly mentally discombobulated - hence the vacant, far-away look in his eyes. 'This is not MDR-TB, this is what even normal TB can do,' says Goldfeld. 'Although the picture was taken in Cambodia, it could have been taken in Kosovo or Cuzco - anywhere that TB is rampant.'</p> <p>Details of Nachtwey's slide show are on <a href=\"http://www.xdrtb.org.\">www.xdrtb.org.</a> For further information about TB worldwide or to donate to TB Alert, go to <a href=\"http://www.tbalert.org\">www.tbalert.org</a> or <a href=\"http://www.stoptb.org\">www.stoptb.org</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The idea was some winter sunshine: two weeks in an exclusive \u00a3220-a-night resort in Gambia. A little light sunbathing. Nothing more strenuous than listening to the fish jumping outside the window of their state-of-the art lodge, which floated on the Mandina Bolong river and had five dedicated members of staff on hand to meet their every need, even a canoeist to row them over to the restaurant.</p> <p>Almost three years on, Brian Harrold, 61, and his partner Pamela Morgan, 55, have returned to Gambia six times, spending \u00a3120,000 of their own money along the way. Not to stay at the eco-lodge, as sumptuous as it was, but because, a few miles from their hotel, on their first trip, they came across what might be called the 'real' Gambia.</p> <p>They were half way through a walking safari with their hotel guide, Lamin, when Pamela noticed a wisp of smoke in the distance.</p> <p>'What happens over there?' she asked. (I have the impression Pamela asks this kind of question quite a bit.)</p> <p>'You can't go there,' said the guide.</p> <p>'That's where we want to go,' said Brian. (I have the impression Brian doesn't often take no for an answer either).</p> <p>They made a pact. If Brian and Pamela didn't tell his boss, Lamin would take them to the village that was the source of the smoke.</p> <p>Most tourists in Gambia never see the local villages. Even the journey from the airport to the main tourist beaches has been sanitised for the sake of the country's ever more lucrative tourist industry. Transfer coaches hum along a new dual carriageway, lined with flags. </p> <p>What visitors rarely discover is that on the Economic Development Index Gambia is at number 192 out of 208 countries. Life expectancy is 56 years; infant mortality rate is 112 out of 1,000 (compared with six out of 1,000 in the European Union). Lack of clean water is one of the major causes of infant deaths.</p> <p>If we're honest, most of us who have ever been on a luxury holiday to a developing country make a deal with ourselves. We become, temporarily, severely myopic. Lying on a beach, or lazing by the pool, we know we're a cocktail coaster away from abject poverty but we edit out the reality. And why not? We tell ourselves. We're on holiday. We deserve it. What can we do about it anyway?</p> <p>Brian and Pamela were seasoned travellers. After careers building up separate, highly profitable businesses in manufacturing and the motor trade, they were enjoying their early retirements, comfortable in the knowledge that there was enough money in the bank. As well as lots of golf (they'd met five years ago on a golf course), they'd trekked in the Himalayas, done charity work in Thailand. However, nothing prepared them for the village of Bafaluto.</p> <p>'Houses made from mud, holes for windows and doors,' remembers Pamela. 'Two or three families in each house. Really clean but absolutely nothing inside them: no chairs, no tables, no beds. Just what looked like an empty duvet cover to sleep on.' Brian adds: 'No sewage system, no electricity, no clean water, nothing.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, the villagers were friendly, if surprised, to meet this couple from County Antrim. Two bottles of very warm Fanta were rustled up by way of refreshment.</p> <p>That evening, sitting down to a delicious dinner back at the hotel, the couple were uncharacteristically quiet with one another.</p> <p>'Well, what are we going to do about it?' said Pamela.</p> <p>'About what?' said Brian.</p> <p>'You know bloody well about what,' she said.</p> <p>'We'll go back tomorrow and have another look.'</p> <p>The following day they went with a retired headmaster, Momodou Joof, to see the village chief. 'We would like to do something for you,' they told him. 'It was as vague as that,' recalls Pamela. 'In my mind I was probably thinking five grand or something.'</p> <p>The chief's reaction was lukewarm. 'They never expected to see us again,' says Brian.</p> <p>Two months later, Pamela and Brian were back in Bafaluto, sitting under a large mango tree with Momodou, several government officials, and 120 representatives of the 600 villagers, a mixture of men and women (Pamela's only stipulation was that the women should have their say.) </p> <p>On the ground, in the red dust, they traced a map of the village. Next they debated what they needed. A grid was drawn: six squares, six options. A clinic, a school, electricity, a clean water supply, a road and a vegetable garden. Each villager was given a white stone with which to cast their vote.</p> <p>'The decision was debated and made exactly as it would have been in a boardroom, except it happened on the ground,' says Brian. A clean water supply and a vegetable garden were the unanimous choices. Momodou, whom the couple had grown to trust, was asked to go away and get the price.</p> <p>An easily available, clean water supply had the potential to save lives and transform village routine, particularly for the women. Each day they would fetch water from the well. Each bucketful had to be boiled, which meant finding wood too. It was arduous work. In the rainy season, from June to October, it was even worse.</p> <p>The couple gave Momodou a laptop and a digital camera which meant they could monitor progress by way of daily emails and picture updates. By November 2007, with the help of a hydrologist, a six-inch borehole had been dug, 80 metres deep; solar panels installed for the electricity to pump the water into a storage tank from which it could feed taps throughout the village. </p> <p>They were just weeks away from fresh clean water. In the meantime, three acres had been cleared and six irrigation wells hand dug which meant they could grow fruit and vegetables to harvest four times a year. A fence was built to keep out animals. Now they had a way of earning money which would pay for the upkeep of the pump.</p> <p>I wonder what it is about this pragmatic, rather self-effacing couple that has made them give up hundreds of hours, not to mention a hefty chunk of their savings. </p> <p>True - they're more financially secure than most people. But not many retired entrepreneurs would bother with this kind of unglamorous and ambitious charity work. At one point they even drove to Gambia from Spain, through Mauritania and Senegal, in their 4X4: 5,000km with the boot packed with sanitary towels and seeds for the villagers.</p> <p>'You can only play so much golf,' says Brian. 'Apart from raising a family, this is by far the most worthwhile thing I have ever done.' He thinks about the many young Gambian men who risk their lives to reach what they hope might be new opportunities in Spain. 'Instead of spending millions building big fences along the north of Morocco, if we fed the money into the villages they wouldn't want to leave. We've spoken to migrant workers - every one of them would rather be back home with their family.'</p> <p>Now they've set up a charity, Ping, (People In Need in Gambia) and are working with another village, Njongon, which is on the North Bank, a remote and even more impoverished part of Gambia. </p> <p>Nine other villages have come forward saying they need help. People are moving to Bafaluto because they can see how the village's fortunes have improved since getting the water supply. The success convinces Brian and Pamela that the work is a comparatively cheap, quick and effective way to transform people's lives but now they need outside donations, perhaps, even, a major sponsor. They want to raise \u00a31m.</p> <p>'We've proved that our money could do what we wanted it to do,' says Pamela. 'It was value for money when you think of the number of lives it has helped. What we need now is outside financial assistance. If people will donate, we will be as careful with their money as we were with our own. </p> <p>'We didn't go on holiday to say: let's find a mission. But when we walked out of the hotel and went to where the Gambian people were we found there was a whole different world out there. We couldn't ignore them.'</p> <p>\u2022 To find out more and to make a donation visit <a href=\"http://www.pingcharity.co.uk\">pingcharity.co.uk</a></p> <h2>Volunteering holidays</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338307131\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/christyopehrhillembed.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Hill teaching in Vietnam\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Hill teaching in Vietnam</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>'I was working in the city and at a bit of a crossroads'<br>Christopher Hill, founder Hands Up Holidays</strong><br>'Before I set up Hands Up Holidays I was working in the City in banking and head hunting. I was at a bit of a crossroads. I'd learnt some good business skills but was a bit disillusioned and looking for something else. Two travel experiences in 2002 led me to change direction. First I went to Guatemala to learn Spanish and ended up teaching the family English, before travelling round the country. </p> <p>'Then I went to South Africa and a friend who is a tour guide put me in touch with a house-building association and I helped with building work in a township outside of Cape Town, before exploring southern Africa. I loved the combination of cultural immersion with giving something back and the adventure of travelling. Slowly the idea for Hands Up Holidays began to form. I went back to the City until the end of the year, then took time out to study and work on my business plan.</p> <p>'My very first itinerary, prepared by my friend the tour guide, was in South Africa. I was close to launching when someone in the travel industry told me I should wait until I had more destinations to gain more credibility, so I ended up travelling a lot and building up relationships with volunteer projects and local tour operators. When we launched in 2006 we offered about 20 destinations. The idea is that a Hands Up Holiday is a starting point for people to dip their toes into volunteering, then hopefully go on to do something more substantial. </p> <p>'We also encourage people to volunteer back at home in their own communities, and become advocates or on-going sponsors for projects they've worked on. Projects range from being a reading partner in schools in countries where they speak English such as South Africa, to repair and renovation work or environmental conservation.</p> <p>'It's very rewarding for our clients, as well as the communities they're helping. There's no comparison to what I was doing before; setting up Hands Up Holidays satisfied my passion for travel and desire to make a difference and I wouldn't go back.'</p> <p>\u2022 Hands Up Holidays (0800 783 3554; <a href=\"http://www.handsupholidays.com\">handsupholidays.com</a>)</p> <h2>School exchange programme</h2> <p><strong>'Ghana was a real eye-opener for our pupils'<br>Deborah Sharman, head of food and nutrition, West Buckland School, Barnstaple, Devon</strong><br>'I went to Ghana with Explore on a two-week tour in December 2004 and loved the country. I didn't know anything about it before I went, I ended up there by default really (Thailand was where I'd planned to go) but it was such a fascinating experience, the people were so lovely and there was a real buzz about it.</p> <p>'When I found out that the tour guide's brother was a teacher, too, I started to think about how we might be able to work together. I work in a small private school in north Devon and the children aren't exposed much to other cultures so I thought it would be a great opportunity for them to learn about other children's lives in Ghana.</p> <p>'I applied for funding from the British Council and received a Reciprocal Visit Grant, which meant myself and a colleague were able to visit the school to set up the project and two teachers from Ghana were able to come to us. </p> <p>'It was eye-opening. The school is in a village called Boanim in the Ashanti region. It's very basic with open-sided classrooms, and the primary school just has corrugated tin roof huts with dirt floors. We brought as much educational equipment with us as we could and we were welcomed with a ceremonial pageant by the chief and the elders.</p> <p>'We started a correspondence programme between the pupils, and began fundraising for more books, educational games and stationery to take out. Last year, we took four girls from the sixth form to visit the school, staying in the family compound of one of the teachers. It was an incredible experience for the girls - they were shocked by the poverty and learnt a lot. It was wonderful to see how much they got out of it and the relationships they formed with the Ghanaian children. </p> <p>'We're now hoping to raise more funds to continue the project. It's been so interesting and rewarding; we want to plant 150 teak trees there to mark our school's 150th anniversary this year too.'</p> <h2>Favela project in Rio</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338307132\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/favelaembed.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer painting a favela home\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A volunteer painting a favela home</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>'People can really make a difference'</strong><br><strong>Kate Nowakowski, co-founder Jingando Holidays</strong><br>'It all started when I was travelling in Brazil. I met Teresa who was volunteering there, we were both looking to leave what we'd been doing in the UK (I was in media and she was a manager at Centrica) - and both wanted to learn to dance samba. Slowly an idea started to form. </p> <p>'People feel daunted by Rio and it's hard to get beyond the usual tourist traps. We built up relationships with locals and really got to know the city and felt we could offer an insider's guide and unique holiday experiences. We got involved with community work in the favelas (slums), painting people's houses, and found that visitors were really interested in joining in. So we started Jingando Holidays, which offers holidays in Rio combining dancing and community work and the chance to see Brazil from a local's point of view. The people are poor financially but culturally rich, it's good to give something back and people really do make a difference, even doing something in an afternoon or a day can have an impact. </p> <p>'We're involved with the Julio Otoni favela project helping fund a community centre and out-of-school activities to keep kids off the streets. We're also developing a footwear brand, Jingando shoes, bringing fashion and ethics together and making sure the money comes back to the locals. It's all been a fantastic experience - it's important to do something for reasons that aren't about making money and are environmentally and socially positive.'</p> <p>\u2022 Jingando Holidays (020 8877 1630; <a href=\"http://www.jingandoholidays.com\">jingandoholidays.com</a>)</p>",
  "<p>The bike was hanging off the railings, a metre or so above the ground, gleaming spectrally in the dusk. It was painted white and its luminosity emphasised the simple sweep of the frame, the elegance of its engineering. Only up close could you see that it looked so stark and sculptural because all the extraneous bits - chain, brake cables, the rubber on the handlebars and pedals - had been stripped away. It was only the skeleton of a bike and there was a plaque hanging off the crossbar: 'In memory of Smudge, 1971-2008.'</p> <p>When I first noticed it, I had no idea this bike was part of a viral campaign of memorialising that had started five years earlier and has since surfaced in more than 50 cities, from Vienna to S\u00e3o Paulo, Whangerei to Toronto. But in subsequent weeks, I spotted two more skeletal white bikes within a few miles of the first, commemorating the deaths of cyclists on the streets of London. </p> <p>In the past year, ghost bikes have appeared in Wales, Oxford, Brighton and York, as well as in the capital. Many are the work of cycling groups that want not only to remember the dead, but to draw attention to the vulnerability of cyclists; bikes as both a shrine and a political statement. Not all cyclists are in favour, however; some argue that they give the impression cycling is more dangerous than it is.</p> <p>Within half an hour's bike ride from my house, I can see three, which seems a scary amount of death on two wheels. Yet that impression is not borne out by the facts, even taking into account two highly publicised fatalities in London in the past fortnight. (Both involved lorries, which are implicated in the overwhelming majority of cycling deaths in the capital.) Since 2000, cycling in London has doubled, but there are 19 per cent fewer deaths than in the mid-1990s, an average of 20 a year. Nationally, 136 people were killed cycling in 2007 and 146 the year before.</p> <p>Some ghost bikes are temporary - the Oxford and York bikes have gone and one in Greenwich Park, south east London, was 'reluctantly removed after a month' following discussions with the Royal Parks. Some local authorities are more tolerant - the Brighton bike has been in place for nearly a year, while Transport for London, which controls the major routes in the capital, says: 'We wouldn't expect to be asked permission for a ghost bike and we wouldn't seek to remove it.'</p> <p>The ghost bike for Smudge was locked to the railings on the corner where he died by friends, who tend it with fresh flowers. A laminated order of service is attached to the frame and a photograph to the front wheel, from which you learn that Smudge's real name was Antony Smith, that he came from Clitheroe, Lancashire, and had a nice smile. They played Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' at his funeral. On the front of the order of service, it said: 'You hold your child's hand for a while, but you hold his heart for ever.'</p> <p>Other ghost bikes are left by family, like the one in north Wales that Peter Cawley set up recently to commemorate his brother Barry, 37, killed by a speeding car in July 2000. Some are installed under cover of darkness, as if they had washed up through the traffic of their own accord; others with a small ceremony, as when Greenwich Cyclists, which is campaigning to ban cars in Greenwich Park, kept a minute's silence for Lennard Woods, killed there in June 2007, which was attended by his wife and daughters. </p> <p>The dispersed, viral and largely spontaneous British ghost bike phenomenon has its origins in St Louis, Missouri, where, in 2003, a young man called Patrick Van der Tuin saw an SUV hit a woman in a cycle lane. Later, under cover of darkness, he placed a white bike at the scene with a notice saying: 'Cyclist struck here.' Passing it each day, Van der Tuin was impressed by the effect his installation seemed to have on drivers: they were slowing down, taking notice. So, one Sunday night, he and a few other enthusiasts set out after dusk with 15 twisted cycles on their bike racks. Stopping at intersections where they knew cyclists had been hit, they locked them to street lamps and signposts and moved on.</p> <p>The idea of the white bike as a haunting symbol was already in the air: in April 2002, San Francisco-based artist Jo Slota had begun painting abandoned bikes he found on the streets, documenting the results on his Ghost Bike website. Between 2002 and 2005, Slota painted 23 broken bikes - sometimes a complete frame, sometimes a lone wheel left pathetically propped in a rack. 'I see them as \"dead bikes\",' he said, 'and paint their remains to emphasise their ghost-like quality.' Initially, he resented cycling activists appropriating his guerrilla art tactics and ghost bikes name, although he now feels flattered that his idea has proved so potent and adaptable.</p> <p>The bikes arrived in Britain when Steve Allen, a website designer and keen cyclist, heard that 23 activists in Seattle had spent three months collecting online submissions of cycling accidents, not necessarily fatalities, and had mapped them on a website. In August 2005, the Seattle group placed 40 ghost bikes at the worst locations, each with a notice saying: 'A cyclist was struck here.' They refused to reveal their identities, claiming they wanted to keep the focus off individuals and on road safety.</p> <p>Allen developed a UK version of the site, with the initial aim of mapping dangerous intersections and marking them with white bikes, rather than commemorating the dead ('We don't put out the bikes; other people do that'). But the focus of the website has since shifted, mainly in response to the impact of ghost bikes in New York. </p> <p>There, a group called Visual Resistance, which specialises in politically engaged street art, started creating ghost bikes to mark the 20 deaths on average a year in the city. Their campaign was aided by tolerant city authorities and 45 ghost bikes are still in place in New York's five boroughs. They have now become the responsibility of the Street Memorial Project, a coalition that also campaigns for pedestrians. </p> <p>'The instinct has been to treat these crashes as akin to weather, as something we can never change,' says spokesman Wiley Norvell. 'Ghost bikes defy that convention. They make people aware of the individual who has died. And they work as visual, artistic traffic calming.'</p> <p>The New York bikes have become a powerful symbol. In residential areas, they are visited every day, supplied with fresh flowers and regularly repainted. They have also become a poignant focus for campaigning. On the first Sunday in January, cyclists organise a memorial ride taking in all of them and installing new ones to mark deaths in the preceding 12 months.</p> <p>The British ghost bike phenomenon remains much more diffuse and less well understood. A memorial to James Foster in Essex Road, on the Hackney-Islington border in London, has recently been vandalised; it is now missing its front wheel, pedals and handlebars and hangs off its post looking battered and lost. James's friend Sarn Baggett, who built it out of spare parts at Mosquito Bikes, where he and James both worked, says all the components were unusable. Perhaps the vandals didn't understand the bike's significance, although it is also possible that people in London are simply less civilised and sympathetic than those in New York.</p> <p>James, who was 37, was pushing his bike across the road when he was hit by a car driven by 24 year-old Sabrina Harman. She was over the drink-drive limit and speeding and had a previous conviction for drink-driving. She had been banned for a year and still had not regained her full licence. </p> <p>Foster was well-known and much loved among London cyclists. A tall Tasmanian, with long red dreadlocks, he shared a house with nine other Australians and New Zealanders. Baggett remembers him as 'a classic gentle giant with a massive smile', while his friend Therese Kilpatrick recalls 'a quiet, exceptional person who was incredibly generous with his time, who respected everyone'. He loved cycling and skateboarding and anything to do with adventure; he was also deeply concerned about the environment.</p> <p>Steve Allen cites his death as one of the reasons why he wanted to set up the Ghost Cycle website. The idea of a ghost bike, though, was Sarn Baggett's. 'A group of us gets together for a drink every year to remember him and it seemed like a good way of marking the fifth anniversary of his death. At that stage, I'd only seen ghost bikes on websites. I built it, then painted it in a couple of afternoons.' The bike appeared on the street in July this year. When I last spoke to Baggett, he was still very annoyed at the vandalism, but thinking of rebuilding it.</p> <p>Even with the long-term decline in cycling deaths, it seems likely that the numbers of ghost bikes will continue to grow, probably becoming as familiar as the floral shrines to the dead that now decorate the pavements. While campaigners are right to argue that one cycling death is too many, it would be unfortunate if the proliferation of ghost bikes frightened off nervous waverers, because there is quite a lot of evidence that the more cyclists there are, the safer cycling becomes. But if, as activists insist, white bikes grab the attention of motorists, give them pause and remind them to take care, they will mark the past and help safeguard the future.</p> <p>The other reservation sometimes expressed about ghost bikes has to do with the families of the dead. It's all very well for cyclists to erect memorials to their friends, who may have been cycling enthusiasts, but some families want to be left to get on with their grieving. They don't want to become advocates for cycling safety.</p> <p>Alison Swann heard about the ghost bike commemorating her brother, 'in rather an unfortunate way, through the local paper'. James Danson-Hatcher had been killed eight months earlier, at the age of 23. A keen photographer and cyclist, he had spent a spring day cycling on the Downs above Brighton and had been on his way home when he was hit by a car doing close to the 60mph speed limit. The driver was not prosecuted. </p> <p>Despite this less than ideal beginning, Alison has become an enthusiastic supporter of her brother's ghost bike, both as memorial and warning. 'James was a bit of an activist. He was into green issues and he was a very proficient cyclist. My mum and sister and I all agree that he would have thought it was a brilliant idea. Car drivers fundamentally believe they own the roads. They don't have the 360-degree awareness they need. If ghost bikes can help make people more conscious of sharing the roads, they must be good. I think it's rather beautiful, actually.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ghostcycle.org\">ghostcycle.org</a></p> <p><strong>James Foster, 36</strong><br><strong>Died July 15 2003</strong></p> <p>James Foster, an Australian who had lived in London for several years, died after he was hit by a speeding car while wheeling his bike across Essex Road in north-east London. The driver had a previous drink-drive conviction and was over the limit. James, who worked at Mosquito Bikes on Essex Road, was a distinctive and popular figure, and the inspiration for the original Ghost Cycle website in the UK. His friend and colleague at Mosquito, Sarn Baggett, built and painted the ghost bike, which was installed on the fifth anniversary of his death. It has since been vandalised. </p> <p><strong>James Danson-Hatcher, 23</strong><br><strong>Died May 4 2007</strong></p> <p>James Danson-Hatcher was on his way home from an afternoon's cycling on the South Downs when he died in a collision with a car at the junction of Devil's Dyke and Saddlescombe Road.

  "<p>Gordon Brown and other European Union leaders called last night for a global economic summit to 'rebuild the world's financial system' as they held emergency talks on how to prevent a repeat of the current international credit crisis.</p> <p>At a hastily convened meeting in Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the heads of the EU's four biggest economies - Germany, France, the UK and Italy - were united on the need to call all leading economic nations together to create 'a new financial world just as Bretton Woods did 60 years ago'.</p> <p>The summit, planned for next month, is expected to include the G8 leading industrial nations, as well as India, China, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico. Sarkozy, who called last night's meeting in his role as EU President, said it was time for governments to clamp down on speculators and restore a moral element to the heart of a regime that had failed.</p> <p>'We need to literally rebuild the international financial system. We want to lay the foundations of entrepreneurial capitalism, not speculative capitalism,' he said.</p> <p>As part of a rolling programme of announcements, the EU's 'big four' agreed to release \u00a312bn of emergency aid to ailing small businesses across the EU immediately, and a further \u00a312bn as soon as possible after that. The European Investment Bank had said the money would be released gradually over the next four years. </p> <p>Calling for a more co-ordinated response to the credit crisis, Brown said international co-operation on regulation was needed. 'We are seeing, in addition to the national action we are taking, that these global problems about oil, about the credit crunch, need global solutions,' he said. 'I think in the next few weeks we have got to show how we can do more in Britain and across Europe to help small businesses, as well as households, through what is a difficult economic time but where I believe Britain can lead the way out of the difficulties.'</p> <p>Action was needed, and would be taken, to protect all solvent banks in the EU. 'I want the message to go out from this meeting today that no sound solvent bank should be allowed to fail for lack of liquidity,' Brown added. The meeting's main pledges on restoring sound financial systems will be looked at next week by finance ministers from all 27 EU states during talks in Luxembourg.</p> <p>Germany repeated its opposition to the use of taxpayers' funds to help ailing banks after calls from France for a European equivalent of the $700bn US bail-out agreed on Friday night. Germany's Economy Minister, Michael Glos, said such a \u20ac300bn rescue fund was a non-starter. 'I do not think it can be justified in this situation to ask the state to restore trust that has been gambled away with large-scale debt relief plans financed by tax money,' he said.</p>",
  "<p>A British study, commissioned by Nasa, has concluded that many of the world's greatest expeditions, including the Apollo moon missions, were either short-term or long-term failures - or both. Although hailed as heroes, Raleigh, Shackleton and other explorers made less of an impact on world affairs than previously thought, says the report.</p> <p>Now space agency managers hope this study of failures will help them guide America to success when it starts sending men and women to the moon and beyond in the next 10 years. Researchers analysed six voyages. Only Columbus's and John Franklin's 1845 expedition to find the Northwest Passage - on which all his 129 crewmen died - had any strategic merit, it was found. The Apollo missions achieved their initial goal of putting men on the moon but failed to fulfil Nasa's long-term hopes of opening the solar system to human exploration. </p> <p>Three other expeditions were studied by Professor Tim Bedford and colleagues at Strathclyde University's management science department: Raleigh's 16th-century attempt to set up colonies in America; Scotland's bid to establish a colony in Panama in the 17th century; and Shackleton's 1914 exploration of Antarctica. Each was both a short-term and a long-term failure.</p> <p>The analysis is being studied by Nasa as it prepares for more space exploration with a manned rocket programme in 2015. 'Our most important observation was that, of the six great expeditions we looked at, all - with the exception of the Apollo moon landings - were failures in terms of meeting their original objectives,' said Bedford. Columbus failed to find a new route to Asia. Shackleton failed to cross Antarctica in 1915 after his ship was trapped in sea ice. Franklin and his crew died seeking a passage to the Pacific. Raleigh's colony was wiped out. Worst of all, the Darien scheme was such 'a political, economic and social disaster' - thanks to English and Spanish opposition - that it bankrupted Scotland and forced it to agree to the 1707 Act of Union. With Columbus and Franklin, the failures were mitigated by long-term beneficial results; the former discovered the New World, while ships sent to find Franklin made key discoveries that led to the finding of the Northwest Passage.</p> <p>By contrast, Apollo achieved its goal of putting men on the moon before the Russians, but the equipment used had no application for other projects. The programme cost \u00a370bn in today's money. Nasa has since struggled to find a reason to put men into space; hence the interest of executives setting up the Constellation programme which will take astronauts back to the moon next decade and later to Mars. 'We presented our study to senior Nasa managers, including Jeff Hanley, head of the Constellation programme,' said Bedford. 'We made it clear we are risk analysts, not historians... We also made it clear that even failed expeditions can teach us something. You cannot look at Shackleton - who saved all his men in dreadful circumstances - and not be roused by his achievement. Apollo 13, which nearly ended in disaster, is probably the most inspiring of all the moon missions.'</p>",
  "<p>Peter Mandelson yesterday buried the threat of a Blairite coup against Gordon Brown, declaring he was 'joined at the hip' to the Prime Minister, who would lead Labour into the next election. </p> <p>He spoke as it emerged that Brown had been snubbed by Jon Cruddas, the left-wing standard bearer and former deputy leadership challenger, who yesterday rejected several offers of a government job. His decision to remain on the back benches has scuppered plans for a 'unity government' representing all strands of party thinking.</p> <p>However, Mandelson's intervention in effect confirms that the leadership ambitions of David Miliband are dead in the water, with Tony Blair's inner circle rallying around the Prime Minister at a time of economic and political crisis. The new Business Secretary took the job only after gaining Blair's approval for the move. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer, Mandelson insisted that he and Brown had 'never entirely lost our friendship' and said he had been at times 'a bit combative, probably a bit prickly', but suggested the past should be left behind.</p> <p>Mandelson said he and the Prime Minister had 'learnt lessons' over their years of feuding. Warning that the government must get better at forging and selling new policies, he added: 'I think all the cabinet share this view. And I think they also know what's been missing, and what has to be put in place.'</p> <p>His words raise questions over his precise role in preparing for the next election, with widespread speculation that he is seeking a more hands-on role in co-ordinating the government's message. Reports that he would be named election co-ordinator - Douglas Alexander's role in the cabinet - were denied by Downing Street yesterday, but sources said further changes to the political and spin operation around Downing Street are likely in the coming weeks. </p> <p>Brown has also bowed to pressure to move his parliamentary aide, Ian Austin, his eyes and ears among Labour MPs. He will be replaced by Jon Trickett, who is close to the soft-left Compass group of MPs and will be expected to bind potentially rebellious left-wingers in behind the government, just as Mandelson's appointment ties Blairites to it. </p> <p>Eyebrows were also raised after Shriti Vadera, the controversial trade minister and ex-City banker, was given a powerful new role based partly in the Cabinet Office overseeing business and enterprise issues across the government. The promotion of Vadera, who advised Brown closely on the recent rescue packages for failing British banks, will be seen as offering him an alternative voice on economic policy from the Treasury. </p> <p>Barely 24 hours after joining the government Mandelson was last night embroiled in his first row after being forced to deny claims he had 'dripped pure poison' about Brown in a private conversation with a senior Conservative. Weeks before rejoining the government he is said to have complained that Brown had left Labour vulnerable to the charge of creating a 'culture of debt'.</p> <p>The new Business Secretary insisted the allegations were 'baseless fiction' and Tory propaganda. However the reports will worry Labour MPs planning to raise concerns about Mandelson's appointment when the Commons returns this week. In his interview Mandelson insisted his problems with the Brown camp were in the past. He said: 'What's important is what things are like now, and will be in the future. Certainly from here on in we're joined at the hip.' </p> <p>Ed Balls and Alexander, who have both clashed with Mandelson in the past, issued supportive statements yesterday although Balls admitted the appointment was 'a risk'. </p> <p>The Prime Minister was yesterday struggling to complete his reshuffle from Paris. He began moving junior ministers on Friday afternoon in what was expected to be a routine operation but by last night was still unable to name his government after meeting a number of obstacles.</p> <p>Cruddas had indicated he wanted a government job after refusing one last year. However, he is understood to have held out for a role in party management which Brown was not prepared to offer, and rejected several other posts, including one overseeing apprenticeships and skills. He has told friends he will concentrate on fighting the BNP in his constituency. </p> <p>Chris Bryant and Si\u00f4n Simon, both involved in the September coup that forced Blair to name his departure date, yesterday won government jobs while health minister Ivan Lewis - tipped for the sack after criticising the Brown regime - survives but will move departments. Phil Woolas, whose Oldham constituency gives him experience of fighting the BNP, is immigration minister while rail minister Tom Harris, author of a candid political blog, was sacked.</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow evening in America, women's football fans will sit down in front of their television screens to watch the draft for the new Women's Professional Soccer league, followed by a live phone-in and discussion on Fox Sports.</p> <p>It is a scenario that women's football fans in this country can only dream of. In England it is still a major coup to be able to watch live games on TV, let alone football discussion shows at prime time. The difference will be more marked still when the US launch their revamped professional league in April, having targeted some of the best players in the world - including two-time Fifa world player of the year Brazil forward Marta - and England stars Kelly Smith and Karen Carney.</p> <p>With the FA's announcement of plans for a summer Super League to be launched in 2010, including central contracts for England players, and Hope Powell's England side qualifying for the European Championships last week, it is a buoyant time for the women's game. But compared with what is going on around the world, is enough really being done to elevate women's football in England?</p> <p>Already Sweden's most successful team, Umea IK, pay professional wages to 75 per cent of their players and rival men's teams in terms of their TV coverage, many of Germany's players have semi-professional status, Holland's new league is tied to and funded by the men's Eredivisie so that women footballers have their playing expenses covered, and Australia's new W-League is fully professional. English domestic football could end up playing a frustrating game of catch up.</p> <p>Sue Tibballs, chief executive of the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation, is measured in her assessment. 'What the FA are proposing is a great first step, but it's a cautious one. They could actually take a few big strides, and then you'd suddenly see the thing taking off.'</p> <p>At the newly franchised Chicago Red Stars, head coach Emma Hayes - former assistant coach at Arsenal ladies - is frustrated by the gulf in ambition between US and English football. She says the English approach to developing the game is 'Victorian'.</p> <p>'Working in women's sport in England is so hard, it's draconian,' says Hayes, who reluctantly left Arsenal at the end of last season fearing a dead end in the domestic game. 'Arsenal is my club and I love it more than anything else, it's in my blood, but I want to be the best coach in the world and that's why I came here. This country loves women's football. Loves it.'</p> <p>While Hayes welcomes the FA's announcement, she is concerned the proposals will not do enough. 'If we're going to do it let's do it properly with long-term intentions and not just knee-jerk reactions to a few players being targeted by another league. I hope the FA get their act together. They have enough money to do it, they just don't want to consider financing it.'</p> <p>The current proposals will cost an estimated \u00a31m-\u00a32m a year including central contracts at around \u00a316,000 per player, although this last figure is unconfirmed by the FA. It is a modest outlay for an organisation with an annual turnover nearing \u00a3240m and a pittance compared with WPS budgets of around \u00a31.5m per club, plus the added benefit of sharing facilities and costs with Major League Soccer clubs.</p> <p>The introduction of salaries for England players is a huge development - with many top footballers currently paying to play - but Hayes says it falls short. 'Yes it's great they're supporting national team players but is it really viable? Why would [England footballer] Rachel Yankey give up her business interests [coaching schools] for \u00a316,000? And what about the other players who won't be paid?'</p> <p>The salaries are part of an incentive to keep young talent in the game as well as preventing England's best players from being lured Stateside. The words 'danger' and 'threat' have been on everybody's lips after WPS approaches, and when Kelly Smith admitted being open to a return to America - she played for Philadelphia Charge in 2001 under the previous WPS incarnation - feathers were ruffled.</p> <p>But Hayes believes the focus is all wrong. 'Their initial reaction is they don't want to lose players, but it's great that women footballers are in positions of choice, it's improving the game worldwide. That should be the bigger picture. You can't have a stranglehold on players.'</p> <p>WPS commissioner Tonya Antonucci says she expects English football fans will be 'delighted' to see their players competing in the new league.</p> <p>'It's an opportunity to watch great soccer first and foremost, but we're also providing a platform for players to improve their games and to grow the sport as a whole.' Antonucci says the league should act as a 'beacon' for the rest of the world, and could include international club competitions in future.</p> <p>The global approach seems to have bypassed domestic football here. The English league is not attracting players from outside the British Isles, European footballers don't want to come here, and players outside the EU cannot come because of immigration laws and the non-professional status of clubs. Hayes believes this must change. 'I get approached all the time by quality American footballers who would love to play in England, but we're losing them to Finland and Sweden. We should be challenging that legislation, or finding a way around it.</p> <p>'I want to come home at some point,' says Hayes, 'I really do. But I'm here to improve my country and I want to learn everything I can before I return. I just wish that same learning intention was adopted back home.'</p> <p>After a meeting between the FA and women's Premier League clubs yesterday, an FA spokeswoman said: 'This is the start of something really exciting for women's football in England. We have a well-thought-out approach, not a knee-jerk reaction. We have done a lot of research and this is the start of a four-year strategy for women's football.'</p>",
  "<p>A tiny port of blocky, single-storey, windowless houses built of stone and adobe, Eyl sits beneath the cliffs of a flat-topped and arid mesa. Its dirt roads - little more than paths - are scattered with rocks and goats wander through. Welcome to the pirate capital of the Horn of Africa.</p> <p>Yesterday, just off this lawless coastline, six American warships were circling the hijacked Ukrainian freighter the MV Faina, laden with a cargo of 33 tanks, small arms and ammunition and bound for southern Sudan until it was seized and a $20m ransom demanded. One of the pirates, Sugule Ali, warned last week that they would fight any attempt to re-take the ship until the last of them was dead. Suddenly, the attention of the world is focused on this forsaken corner of the world, where piracy and extortion have become a way of life. </p> <p>The drama in the Gulf of Aden is the latest and most dramatic of 50 serious attacks on ships in this region in the past year. And in the dusty little fishing ports and towns that dot the coastline, an entire economy has been privatised by the overlapping criminal enterprises whose business is the smuggling of weapons and people, obtaining 'taxes' and protection fees from the foreign fishing boats that ply Somalia's waters, and preying on the yachts and cargo vessels that sail off its coast. </p> <p>'It is pretty Wild West,' says Alixandra Fazzina, an award-winning photographer who recently spent time in Somalia's lawless ports documenting the activities of the criminal gangs for a book. 'Fishing and taxes on fishing used to be the country's biggest source of revenue. Now they can't even fish. There are no ice factories and no government. So the fishermen have turned to piracy and people and weapons smuggling.'</p> <p>State writ does not run here. There is no attempt by Mogadishu to fine those illegally fishing in the Gulf of Aden. So sea militias grew up that imposed their own ad hoc fines and taxes, a process that has transformed into outright hijacking and an economy based on criminality.</p> <p>Boatyards produce not fishing boats but vessels intended for smuggling and piracy. Fuel suppliers and merchants equip the boats. Restaurants have grown up to feed hundreds of hostages taken from the tankers and carriers sailed into the waters around Eyl. Officialdom from top to bottom in areas like the autonomous Puntland exists solely to oil the wheels of organised crime. 'Some of these organisations are quite sophisticated,' says Fazzina. 'They'll use their own CB radio networks to organise the laundering of their money.'</p> <p>Eyl has become the modern era's equivalent of Tortuga, the historic Haitian base of the notorious Welsh pirate Henry Morgan. It suddenly bustles with the pirates' go-betweens, the accountants and middlemen and negotiators in their four wheel drives, each time a new captive ship is sailed in. Around \u00a317m has been raised in ransoms in the past 12 months.</p> <p>Most of the money, usually 10-20 per cent of that demanded by the hijackers, is moved quickly along the line to the so-called 'Big Fish' in the clans - in the government of the provincial capital, in Mogadishu and in the Somalian diaspora in Nairobi and Dubai where those behind the piracy are allegedly to be found.</p> <p>'In Bosaso you do see new buildings paid for with crime,' says Fazzina. 'There are smugglers I met who can earn up to $5,000 a month.' The big money, however, is in the ransom payments delivered to the pirate organisations, estimated by security firm AKE, which handles hijackings for a number of shipowners, to number about 15 large gangs.</p> <p>Operating under names such as the 'Somalia Youth Coast Guard', believed to be holding the Faina, and the 'Somali Marines', which captured the luxury French yacht Le Ponant earlier this year triggering a reprisal raid by French commandos, the gangs operating out of Eyl are generally members of rebel regional clans linked to local leader Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed.</p> <p>The Special Representative for the UN Secretary-General for Somalia, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, has directly accused the rulers of Puntland of permitting piracy, even alleging that ransom money would 'be used to fund the 2009 presidential elections in Puntland'.</p> <p>John Chase, managing director for intelligence and crisis response at AKE, says while many groups originally employed the Islamic hawala banking system as a method to launder money, increasingly groups are asking for cash. </p> <p>'There are some groups still asking for hawala, but there are other groups asking for money to be delivered by tug. And yes - that means sacks of money.' </p> <p>Sometimes, however, it is not the money that is most challenging. </p> <p>'The boats will be held for a while. If they are on their way to port they can be short of food. Then the demand is: \"Bring us a cow or some goats killed in the halal way otherwise we are going to start lopping off some heads.\"'</p> <p>The reason for the explosion of piracy is bluntly described by Michael Howlett of the International Maritime Bureau which runs a piracy monitoring centre from Malaysia. 'There are a number of reasons but there being no effective government is the top of them. It has also been fuelled by the willingness to pay ransoms. 'These guys are well organised. It is a business. It is not opportunist and it is supported by members of the Somali community in Dubai and Nairobi. They have mother ships from which they launch their high-speed boats.' Howlett is not optimistic that the current stand-off over the MV Faina will see a willingness to clamp down on Somalia's pirates. 'The current naval forces in the Gulf of Aden are effective. But there aren't unlimited assets for dealing with this problem. Already we are seeing some of the piracy being displaced from the Gulf of Aden to the east coast where incidents are now increasing.'</p> <p>The increasingly aggressive international response to the problems of Somalia's pirates is threatening to make the pirates themselves more dangerous. Where once crews could be expected to be treated relatively well - despite the death by heart attack of the Faina's master - the commando raid launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in April in which six pirates were captured has resulted in instructions from some pirate leaders to kill any Europeans caught if their comrades are not released. In a telephone interview with the Voice of America radio station at the end of September, a man identified as Bileh, the spokesman of the pirate group in Eyl, warned that if other European Union nations refused to negotiate the release of his compatriots, his group would behead any European hostages. However the current confrontation off Eyl is resolved, the battle with the pirates of Puntland is only just beginning.</p>",
  "<p>Before I arrive in Dubai, I meet 'Clare' on an expat website who insists I visit her at her home in the Meadows, a housing development in the city's suburbs - 'to give you an idea of how so many people get misled into thinking they are in Milton Keynes'. Half an hour in a taxi later, past the skyscrapers, and the construction sites, and the six-lane highways, and minibuses of Indian and Pakistani workers being shuttled from one project to another, I'm in a straight-out-of-a-David-Lynch-film picture-perfect suburban road lined with picture-perfect suburban villas.</p> <p>And there's Clare. 'That's what I wanted you to see!' she says before I'm even out of the car. 'Look at that.' I'm looking at a wheelie bin and not really understanding her point. 'People see the wheelie bin and they think it's all familiar, and normal, and therefore nothing bad can happen. Ha!' </p> <p>The Meadows is a gated enclave with a uniformed security guard and lush green landscaping, and Clare is a British expatriate wife whose husband is a contractor. To all intents, they're living what looks very much like the good life: there's a pool in the back garden, year-round sun, and in the living room Sky News is on. </p> <p>'Oh yes, it looks good, doesn't it? But we've all made a pact with the devil to be here. You get the tax-free salary, but in return you have to give up all your rights. There's no accountability, no transparency, no rule of law. There's no legislative body. Very few employment rights. It looks like a modern country, but it takes more than a few skyscrapers to create one of those. Scratch the surface and it's a different story. And if you're a silly young girlie who gets into trouble, then forget it.'</p> <p>There's a particular silly young girlie Clare is referring to: Michelle Palmer, a 36-year-old advertising executive who in July this year was arrested for allegedly having sex on a beach with Vince Acors, a 34-year-old visiting company director from Kent. </p> <p>It's been a tabloid sensation. Palmer's 'Bridget Jones' lifestyle endlessly examined; at least a dozen conflicting versions of the story printed - they did have sex, they didn't have sex, Palmer may or may not have waved her shoe and called the policeman 'a fucking Muslim' - the case comes to court this week and the prosecution is said to have concrete DNA evidence to prove they didn't have sex, but beyond that, almost nothing is certain other than the fact that, if convicted, they both face up to six years in jail.</p> <p>And whatever the verdict, Palmer has already lost her job - with the publishers ITP which produces Time Out Dubai and whose chairman is Andrew Neil; but then there's no such thing as unfair dismissal in the United Arab Emirates - and been mauled in the press. The Daily Mail is in strict accordance with sharia law on this point: it's the woman's shame. </p> <p>In Dubai, it's shocked the local population and split the expat community between those who feel sympathy and those who think she deserves nothing less than a stoning. </p> <p>'What I can't believe,' says Clare, 'is the amount of venom directed towards her. The reaction here has been unbelievable. I think people are under such pressure. They know it's not the dream. And they need a scapegoat. The fact is that if you can ascribe blame to someone else's misfortune, then you are indemnifying yourself against it happening to you.'</p> <p>There are a lot of Brits in Dubai. A lot of people that it, or something similar, could have happened to. People who don't much want to contemplate how the judicial system works (at best haphazardly, at worst unequally), or how long you can be detained without trial (months at a time) or what the British embassy will do to help you (not a lot). In the past year, 230 Britons have found themselves imprisoned for offences ranging from driving under the influence to bouncing a cheque.</p> <p>It's a minimum four-year term if any trace of drugs is found on you: the Radio One DJ Grooverider, caught with 2.16g of cannabis, spent 10 months inside before being pardoned two weeks ago, and Cat Le-Huy, a producer with Endemol, spent three weeks in jail without being charged, for possession of Melatonin - jetlag pills.</p> <p>The Palmer-Acors case is about much more than any of this, though. It's exposed the very contradiction that has made modern Dubai what it is: a tolerant haven in an intolerant region. And it's the tension between the two Dubais: the socially conservative society whose penal code is based on sharia; and the other Dubai, the increasingly visible Dubai, whose numbers are growing with every fresh planeload of people who land at the airport and wear crop tops to the mall and drink shooters in the bars. </p> <p>It's to Dubai's enormous credit that these two halves have so far been accommodated side by side, but the strain has started to tell. When I visited last week, it was Ramadan and the restrictions in Dubai are far harsher than in any other Arab country I've visited. Eating and drinking during daylight hours is illegal; even for non-Muslims, having a sip of water can mean a jail sentence. I got the timing of my trip all wrong. I'd wanted to check out the Friday 'brunch' scene, all-day boozeathons which provided the setting for the Palmer-Acors romance, and I email the editor of an English language newspaper in a panic. </p> <p>'Don't worry,' he emails back. 'You'll see plenty.' And it's true: I can't drink coffee at the Starbucks next to my hotel, food is only served in a curtained-off enclave, and the clubs are closed - a DJ called Michael Robert describes the usual scene as 'like Ibiza but minus the drugs, the fights and the aggro'. But after 7.30pm, all across the city, in any number of bars, it's like downtown Croydon at closing time on a Friday night. </p> <p>At Long's Bar, it's a crush of short skirts and spaghetti straps - alcohol is illegal if you're a local, and practically a social obligation if you're not. And afterwards, a local journalist takes me on a tour of 'the dark side', taking in a hooker bar in a four-star chain hotel. Prostitution is illegal, but absolutely blatant - every shape, size, nationality, ethnicity and possible aesthetic taste catered for. </p> <p>But then, somehow Dubai manages to be all things to all people. It's capitalism's ultimate expression: the land of opportunity, the most developed city in the Middle East, a free port. It's ruled absolutely by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and is a constituent part of the UAE, a federation of seven emirates, including, down the road, immensely oil-rich Abu Dhabi, whose ruling family has just bought Manchester City. Dubai, on the other hand, never had much oil; it's been forced to develop in other ways, to provide whatever is needed, and it's done so more quickly and successfully than anyone could anticipate. It knows what the rest of the world wants and has built it before anyone else has even realised.</p> <p>Alexander McNabb, a PR executive and the writer of a blog called Fake Plastic Souks, arrived 15 years ago, when 'it was still a village, a strange and very foreign place'. It was the entrep\u00f4t of the Gulf and its R'n'R facility, where oilmen came to relax - they knew the rules and relished the freedom. It's this that's changed. There are now 100,000 Brits living and working in Dubai. And last year 1.1m UK tourists visited - despite summer temperatures of 50C plus, it's now the second most popular long-haul destination after Florida. And the ways in which the city is changing are in many ways a reflection of Britain itself.</p> <p>Now, says McNabb, 'you drive your western car to your western office. At the weekends you go to the western hotels and have your western buffets and western-style beach club, and it's quite easy to ignore the fact that you're abroad.'</p> <p>He's right. It is easy. It's four days before I hear any actual Arabic. Most remarkably of all the remarkable things about Dubai is that it's occupied almost entirely by foreigners: native Emiratis make up barely 20 per cent of the population. They're a minority in their own country. </p> <p>When I meet Sultan Al-Qassemi, a businessman and journalist, he points out that the Emiratis are handling this rather better than the British would. 'Can you imagine? It's the equivalent of there being 55m foreigners in Britain, and just 5m of you. It's a unique case, and I think we deserve extra credit for the way we are handling it. The country is completely open. It is a utopia! Anyone can come here! We are one of the most tolerant countries in the world. And all this has happened in a single generation. Thirty years ago, it was desert.'</p> <p>He sends me down the road, to the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding and I arrive in time for iftar - the breaking of the fast. There's a group of expats and we're given dates and water, and then platters of home-cooked food are brought while young Emiratis tell us about their culture. It's fascinating: they're so friendly, and articulate and welcoming. 'It's so difficult to meet Emiratis, to talk to them. In a year, I haven't properly met one,' a British woman named Paula tells me. </p> <p>Khulooda, a bright and sparky 21-year-old in a fringed abaya, tells me she's studying marketing and tourism. She thinks people maybe need to do a little more research about the country before they arrive. That maybe people should wear more appropriate clothing when they go to the mall. That Palmer and Acors should have known better. I think maybe she's right. And I hope, for her sake, that she goes into some other industry instead. </p> <p>A decade ago, who had even heard of going on holiday in Dubai? But what Dubai has proved is that if you build it, they will come. For if there's one thing Dubai can do, it's build: one third of the world's cranes are here at any one time, most of them directly outside of my hotel window. I try and count them but give up at 70. The highest is perched a kilometre up in the air, on the top of the Burj Dubai, already the tallest building in the world, and it's not yet finished. Next month, the biggest shopping mall in the world will open, the Dubai Mall, and shortly you'll be able to fly into the world's biggest airport - six runways and the size of Hong Kong island. What's more, if you stay in your hotel, you need never even know you're in an autocratic Islamic state where it's illegal to hold your wife's hand in public, or be gay, or found with 0.003g of cannabis - less than a grain of sugar - on the sole of your shoe, as Keith Brown was, a youth worker from the West Midlands who was sentenced to four years in jail. </p> <p>But the hotels are wonderful. And even the Observer's modest budget runs to a five-star number. I'm on the 35th floor, with vertiginous views down, vertiginous views up. It's slightly queasy-making, more so after I talk to Chris Davidson, a Gulf political expert based at Durham University. </p> <p>Two of the 9/11 hijackers were from the UAE, he tells me. And every weekday, the malls are full of able-bodied young men simply hanging out. 'They're the first generation who've had this cradle-to-grave security, who receive a house from the government and money to get married, who've not known hardship or what it is not to have air conditioning. How are they reacting to what they see happening to their country? And if something did happen here, tourism would collapse overnight. Real estate would collapse. Dubai is so fragile. It's the result of a global boom and it's never properly been put to the test.'</p> <p>Economically, nobody's sure how it will weather the global crisis. The region is awash with ever-increasing petrodollars, but Dubai's construction projects are highly leveraged. And culturally, tourism is Dubai's great unmentionable can of worms, its fault line. A blogger, who'll only identify herself as Secret Dubai, tells me Dubai's marketing machine has deliberately created 'the false sense of westernness, of a trashy holiday resort'. And, according to Davidson, it's reached 'a critical mass. Previously people were corralled into five-star enclaves; what the Palmer-Acors case shows is that they're starting to leak out.'</p> <p>The week I visit, Atlantis opens - a mega resort owned by Sol Kerzner, the South African who gave the world Sun City. It's a vast pink edifice that looks like something Katie Price might design, built on an artificial island shaped like a palm tree. </p> <p>It's actually only one of three palms under construction, which together will add 520km of beaches to Dubai's coastline, and where the Beckhams are alleged to have 'bought' a villa, along with Rio Ferdinand and Michael Owen. It's all PR, but then nowhere in the world wants the Beckhams to love it as much as Dubai. It's more of a WAG than almost any other place on earth: flashy, artificially enhanced, desperate to please, all things to all people.</p> <p>I tour the resort and dutifully write down the stats: $1.5bn to build,1,539 rooms, a Nobu and a Locatelli restaurant, a $25,000-a-night suite, 65,000 marine animals, a 1.4km beach.</p> <p>Do you think most tourists even know it's Ramadan, I ask.</p> <p>'That's a good question,' says the PR, a South African. 'I think they receive information at the airport.'</p> <p>Actually, they don't, I say. We ponder this for a moment, and then she tells me about what a wonderful life she's had since she moved there.</p> <p>Back in the Meadows, Clare invites me to an expat ladies' coffee morning. It's not an obvious place to go and meet a hotbed of radical malcontents. The lawns are neat, the communal pool still inviting. And yet... Nobody's managing to save. Rents are sky high: \u00a345,000 a year for a modest villa, paid in advance. And you can't move jobs: your visa is sponsored by your employer. </p> <p>Jane says: 'If I knew now what I knew then, I just wouldn't have come.' She's spent months and months trying to get her daughter with mild ADHD into any sort of school. Laura bought a house, in a 'lovely, quiet, very green development' and the road in front of it has just been torn up to build a six-lane highway. And Rebecca, who's lived in Dubai for 13 years, tells story after story of the Dubai-dream-gone-wrong. </p> <p>'People just don't know what they're getting themselves into,' she says. 'There's no social infrastructure, no safety net, nothing.' You don't even have to do anything wrong; a bad case of bad luck is enough. She puts me in touch with Richard, a twinkly fortysomething who came to Dubai as a salesman with a multinational company. 'And then, in one month, I had a car accident, lost my job, and my marriage fell apart.'</p> <p>Richard fell behind on his car payments, his bank loans, his credit cards. 'Everybody lives beyond their means here. It's all front. It's like Dubai - a totally false appearance to what it actually is.' He was charged by the police with defaulting on his loans and his passport was confiscated. 'So I couldn't get another job and I couldn't pay the debt, and I couldn't leave the country... and to cut a very long story short, I got 12 months.'</p> <p>It's quite a story. He's only been out two weeks, but he's still managing just about to smile. But not even the judges are Emiratis: they're on short-stay visas like everyone else, and the only thing he had going in his favour, he says, is that he wasn't Asian. 'Tons of them are in for practically nothing: jaywalking or owing \u00a310.'</p> <p>All over Dubai you see construction workers outside in the searing heat. They're the ones building Dubai - they live in what are openly called 'labour camps', have very often paid hundreds of dollars to an agency for a visa and are trapped for years until they've paid off the debt. The 7,500 workers on the Burj Dubai are paid $7.50 a day; unskilled ones $4. It's how globalisation works, of course. We get to buy our cheap Primark tops because in a factory far, far away somebody isn't paid very much to make them. But in Dubai, you see it every time you step outside.</p> <p>Nick McGeehan, founder of an organisation called Mafiwasta, tells me it's more than that. 'The difference is that the salaries paid in sweatshops in foreign countries reflect the economic weakness of that country. Furthermore, the people who work in them go home to their families at night.'</p> <p>He was an oil contractor but was so appalled at the plight of these workers that he set up Mafiwasta and is attempting to make a legal case that the UAE government is complicit in these workers' enslavement. He forwards an email to me he's recently received from an Indian recruitment agent. She's trying to help 133 men she sent to Dubai to fulfil a contract who haven't been paid, whose passports have been confiscated, who are not just living in inhumane, insanitary conditions but had been denied even basic necessities such as drinking water.</p> <p>'It's very unusual for an agent to come forward, and even more so to have one who actually cares about what happens to the workers,' says McGeehan. The only recourse, he tells her, is to get it in the newspapers... </p> <p>Both Secret Dubai and Chris Davidson have fallen foul of the UAE's censorship laws. The Secret Dubai blog, winner of a Webby award, is blocked - along with My Space, Flickr and Friends Reunited - and Davidson's recently published book Dubai: The Vulnerability of Success was, like Harry Potter, banned, although the ban has now been lifted.</p> <p>Mostly though, the authorities rely on editors to self-censor - an even more effective weapon. 'I defy a journalist who has been here a few months, who has got their child into a school, to rock the boat,' says Davidson. I interview a high-profile Emirati academic, and later he rings me up and says: 'You're not going to write anything... critical, are you? Our culture is different from yours, you see. But I didn't say anything negative, did I?'</p> <p>He points me, as several others do, toward Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science at Emirates university, and possibly the most outspoken person in the country. 'He says really quite remarkable things,' the other academic tells me. 'And he gets away with it. It's very surprising.'</p> <p>Maybe he's fearless. Or maybe it is, as he says, that others need to be braver. 'We have to have more accountability of the government, more criticism of the policies. More talk about our future and where we are going. Dubai is an amazing place. We are so much further ahead than the rest of the Middle East, but we can't be first on social indicators and last on political ones... It's an embarrassment.'</p> <p>Even more than that, he says, the place needs to take a long, hard look at itself. Because in 2015, he estimates, Emiratis will make up 10 per cent of the population. And in 2025, at the same rate of growth, zero per cent. 'At the moment when we have everything, we're in danger of losing it all - our very identity.'</p> <p>I don't go out of my way to track Palmer and Acors down. The case is being heard this week so it's a particularly sensitive time for them. And anyway, they're not really the story. They were drunk and foolish and they might pay an exceedingly high price for their actions, but more than anything else they're simply fallout from an ideological schism that is not of their making.</p> <p>I don't look for them, but almost everyone I meet is acquainted with one or both of them. Palmer has been in hiding for the past two months, reportedly suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. And Acors? He's there in Long's Bar when I visit. In fact, he's not just in the same bar, he's standing drinking with the same group of friends.</p> <p>I'm all set to question him, but his friends take me aside: 'He's just an ordinary bloke. He won't talk to you. Just leave him alone.' So I do. It's true, he's just an ordinary bloke. In an extraordinary place. At precisely the wrong moment in time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday October 13 2008.

  "<h2>Jacqui Smith exposed in bondage sensation</h2> <p>Here is something for the Home Secretary to look forward to as she returns to Westminster after the summer recess. A not entirely family friendly group campaigning against the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which comes into force in the new year, is stepping up its campaign and Jacqui Smith is to be its primary target. The campaigners' argument is with the part of the bill that will make it illegal to possess 'extreme pornographic images'. This amounts, they claim, to censorship.</p> <p>Leading the charge is artist Ben Westwood, son of fashion designer Dame Vivienne, who says: 'It's a breach of human rights.'</p> <p>This column has learnt of a plan by Westwood and his friends to project a large image of Jacqui Smith, gagged and tied to a chair, on to the Houses of Parliament. It is, perhaps, important to point out that this is a composite artwork put together by Westwood, not a genuine picture of the Home Secretary. 'It's slightly silly,' admits my source. 'But it also makes an important point about Smith's attempts to gag artists and members of the fetish community.'</p> <p>The exact date of the proposed stunt is a secret in case anyone tries to interfere, but I understand it will take place towards the end of November.</p> <p>Other opponents of the bill include the rather more strait-laced campaigning organisation Liberty, 40 serious academics who question the research behind the bill which suggests viewing such images can affect behaviour, and - pleasingly - the International Union of Sex Workers. </p> <p>It's quite a coalition even for the tough Smith to take on and perhaps it is just as well that she can enjoy the support of the rather more experienced Justice Secretary Jack Straw, who shares responsibility for the legislation.</p> <h2>Daryl Hannah's vegan cred gets booted into touch</h2> <p>Animal rights activists are nothing if not consistent. It was surprising, therefore, to see vegan actress Daryl Hannah, a supporter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, wearing suede boots to Richard Branson's party last week. 'They were my mum's,' she explained. 'I only wear leather when it's a gift.' </p> <p>She's over here to film a movie called Blind Man's Bluff, based on Gilbert Adair's novel A Closed Book, which tells the story of a Booker Prize-winning writer who goes blind following a car crash. Hannah said, after some thought about just what his name was, that it will star Tom Conti and be shot at Knebworth. </p> <p>As befits a talented actress, Hannah has a healthy understanding of the importance of her work. Reflecting on the 1982 film Blade Runner, which made her famous, she added: 'It has influenced whole generations of people. It is such a part of our culture, a bit like Shakespeare.' Yes, a bit.</p> <h2>If Peston's hearing voices, it'll be Dave </h2> <p>BBC business editor Robert Peston has acquired a number of new fans thanks to the credit crunch. David Cameron is apparently not among them. At the Tory conference, he entertained friends with an impersonation, giving crazy emphasis to random words and pulling his face into a mad grin with lots of stutters.</p> <p>I look forward to their next on-air meeting.</p> <h2>George's jollies</h2> <p>Harry Mount, George Osborne's Bullingdon contemporary, launched his book, A Lust for Window Sills, on Tuesday in Marylebone, where I learned the popular shadow Chancellor belonged also to a second private student society: the Gridiron Club, described by Tatler as 'mind-fryingly dull'.</p> <h2>It's Lazarus ... again</h2> <p>Welcome back Peter Mandelson. Readers may remember I reported that the new Secretary of State for Business had been discussing a peerage during his rapprochement meeting with Gordon Brown in March. It is interesting to note the simultaneous demotion of Gordon's spin doctor Damien McBride. Nicknamed 'McPoison', he does not see eye to eye with Mandy who, friends suggest, finds him 'unsavoury'.</p> <p><strong>Newts for you</strong></p> <p>During the London mayoral election, Boris Johnson was teased for being more at home on Have I Got News for You than with the finer points of his policy brief. So who is to be a guest presenter in the next season of the show? None other than Ken Livingstone.</p> <h2>Buffett's booked</h2> <p>Warren Buffett's authorised biography is on the shortlist for the Financial Times Goldman Sachs business book of the year. Buffett has just bought $5bn of Goldman shares. The book has been serialised in the FT. No one suggests the judges would be swayed by such details.</p> <h2>Glad you asked</h2> <p>At last year's Cancer Research UK 'Turn the Tables' fundraiser, where politicians grill journalists, host Michael Portillo 'forgot' to allow a question from a Pendennis reader to be asked. I am assured it won't happen again. So email your question to be put either by Ken Livingstone to Today's Evan Davis or Tory business spokesman Alan Duncan to Sky's Adam Boulton at lunch on 13 October.

  "<p>The 'suitcase girl' who discovered $800,000 in cash and ignited a political scandal across South America - then capitalised on it to forge a career as a Playboy pin-up - has relived her moment of glory in a Miami courtroom.</p> <p>Mar\u00eda del Luj\u00e1n Telpuk, 28, an Argentinian former airport security officer, is testifying in court about the moment she intercepted a suitcase and provoked a row between the governments of Argentina, Venezuela and the US. Claims of high-level corruption, cover-ups and vendettas have followed and commentators have dubbed the scandal 'Maletagate'; maleta is Spanish for suitcase.</p> <p>The furore catapulted Telpuk to stardom as a glamour model, dancer and television celebrity. Telpuk, who promptly underwent breast augmentation surgery, has since appeared on the cover of several magazines, including the Argentinian edition of Playboy in which she appears naked, holding a suitcase, under the headline 'Corruption Laid Bare'.</p> <p>She told a Miami court on Friday what happened at Buenos Aires airport on the night of 4 August, 2007, when passengers disembarked from a flight chartered by Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA.</p> <p>Telpuk asked a Venezuelan-American businessman, Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson, what was in his suitcase. 'At first he said books,' she told the court. 'Then he said \"just some papers\".' Antonini's demeanour changed when she ordered him to open it. 'He became serious and he was staring me straight in the eye. That's when I got a suspicion that something was going on,' said Telpuk. It was packed with wads of $50 bills. </p> <p>Prosecutors allege that it was a clandestine payment from Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to the election campaign of Cristina Kirchner, a left-wing ally who was sweeping to Argentina's presidency.</p> <p>Both leaders have dismissed the accusation as an attempt by Washington to smear two governments which have challenged 'gringo hegemony' in Latin America. </p> <p>Telpuk has testified in the trial of Franklin Dur\u00e1n, a wealthy Venezuelan businessman who is accused of acting as an illegal agent for his government. He and four others were arrested in Miami after allegedly pressuring Antonini, who resides in Key Biscayne, Florida, to conceal the truth about where the money came from.</p> <p>The unusual nature of the charge and the elaborate FBI sting - Antonini co-operated with the Bureau - has prompted widespread speculation that the trial is a politically motivated attempt to embarrass Washington's enemy, President Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>After finishing her testimony next week, Telpuk is expected to return to Argentina, where she is training to become a professional ice-skater to participate in the Skating for a Dream television show.</p>",
  "<p>Malcolm Lowry's flawed masterpiece, one of the great novels of the 20th century, was fortunate to come the way of the 78-year-old John Huston. He knew Mexico, he did well by literary works (Moby-Dick, The Red Badge of Courage) and was fascinated by faithful failures, heroic losers, doomed questors. Lowry's hero, the alcoholic British consul in Cuernavaca, is a Huston hero on a colossal scale, and his sense of damnation is a reflection of the decline of Western civilisation as he views it on the last day of his life in 1938. Albert Finney is superb as the consul and he's ably supported by Jacqueline Bisset as his ex-wife and Anthony Andrews as his half-brother. Huston and co-writer Guy Gallo ironed out a convoluted novel into a linear narrative, but retained its political thrust and striking motifs and symbols. An admirable film that does justice to Lowry and invites us to read or reread his book.</p>",
  "<p>The black Fiat Punto, loaded with cocaine, broke through a road block near Casal di Principe in the hinterland of Naples. Policemen Francesco Alighieri and Gabriele Rossi gave chase. In the pursuit their car keeled off an overpass, wrapping itself around a tree, killing both of them. They had only been in the area a week, drafted from northern Italy following the murder of six Africans by the local Casalesi criminal syndicate. For hours afterwards the lanes around Casal di Principe were scattered with characters in sunglasses sitting in cars and talking on mobiles. Menacing, but hardly mysterious, for these are the sentinels of the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia which is about to achieve worldwide notoriety as the subject of a major new movie. Gomorrah, released this week, will bring worldwide attention to the Camorra: the most potent criminal organisation on the planet.</p> <p>The scenes described above are not from the film. The police chase took place nine days ago when I returned to the area 14 years after last reporting on the Camorra as Italy correspondent for the Guardian. This week the army was being mobilised into the area as three of the top Casalesi were arrested. </p> <p>Gomorrah won the Grand Prix at Cannes in May and was last week chosen as Italy's entry for the Foreign Language Oscar. It is based on a book by Roberto Saviano, who grew up in Casal di Principe and lived alongside the Casalesi clan of the Camorra, one of its most powerful and ruthless. His father, a doctor, was beaten and obliged to hide for months after treating a man the Camorra had wounded. Saviano saw his first corpse in the street when he was 13 but 'never got used to seeing murder victims'. After studying philosophy at Naples University, Saviano observed then wrote about the Camorra with brazen fearlessness. </p> <p>His book had a raw vividness, an attention to human detail and a dimension of outrage that caught public attention in a way that other diligent and brave reporters over decades have not. Now copies of Gomorrah are piled up for sale at every bookshop and motorway service station. It has sold 1.8 million copies and been translated into 32 languages. With the film, Saviano is even more famous, and more of a target. He was threatened by the bosses of his hometown clan and lives under 24-hour armed police watch 'somewhere,' he says, 'in the north of Italy'.</p> <p>We meet at his publishers, Mondadori, in Rome. 'I like these interviews,' he says. 'They give me some sense of space and communication. I live this enclosed life, physically and psychologically. First it was one guard, then two, three, four and five. Two bulletproof cars now. And I can never go home. I love the beauty of Naples, but what happens there I despise; that is what I wanted to write about and do something about.' </p> <p>Saviano made that decision after 14-year-old Annalisa Durante was killed in crossfire between Camorra factions. In the book he describes her friends at the funeral: 'Many of these girls will soon marry Camorristi... Many will bear children who will be killed ... But for now they are just little girls in black. They weep for a friend ... Annalisa is guilty of having been born in Naples. Nothing more, nothing less. As her body is being carried away in its white coffin, a classmate calls her on her cellphone. The ringing in the coffin is the new requiem... No one answers.'</p> <p>In conversation, he adds: 'That they could kill children like that reached a point beyond my understanding, and that moment I decided something had to be done.'</p> <p>The film of Gomorrah is savage, squalid, claustrophobic and relentless. The action is authentic, in gratifying contrast to the grotesque romance of films like The Godfather. 'All Camorristi love Scarface,' says Saviano. He cites newer role models - The Matrix and Pulp Fiction - as 'how the Camorristi want to see themselves'. Among the newly powerful women, Saviano points to a gangster called Immolata Capone who dresses in the same yellow as Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. Saviano calls his book a 'non-fiction novel'. 'There is no need to make anything up. Everything is from real life. Some things have been changed to protect people but I knew the people in this book.'</p> <p>For all their wealth, the Camorristi can be parsimonious. Last week I tracked down the flat in Via Canonico Stornaiuolo that was home to the boss who terrorised the Secondigliano district of Naples during the savage Camorra war which is backdrop to the film. I found a modest place of peeling plaster. When, in 2005, the police came for Paolo Di Lauro, whose empire was worth billions, the only personal assets they discovered were playing cards, cheap furniture, a TV, cigarettes and peppers drying on a newspaper. And this was the man who established what Saviano calls 'the biggest narcotraffic holding company, nationally or internationally' in the world.</p> <p>The English edition of Saviano's book is subtitled Italy's Other Mafia in recognition of the incorrect supposition among British and American readers that the Sicilian Mafia is the premier organisation. The Neapolitan Camorra was Italy's original Mafia by a century; it commands a higher turnover - and a higher body count than any criminal syndicate in the world: 4,000 over the past four decades.</p> <p>I was unaware of this when I started to report from Italy in 1990. The Camorra first attracted international attention in 1991 when it was found to have ensnared the footballing Messiah of Naples, Diego Maradona. He bought his cocaine from the Camorra, and became a trophy for the bosses, photographed in their shell-shaped baths and at weddings of their children. 'It is a very strong identity, to be Neapolitan,' says Saviano. 'You love the place, and you hate it. I am estranged from it now, which is extremely difficult.' </p> <p>Naples is a proud but battered city where life is agrodolce, bittersweet: a city of breathtaking beauty but perched on a fault line and nestled under a volcano. Much of life is lived in shadow yet there can be no secrets in the warrens of alleyways, steps and courtyards from which great domes and fa\u00e7ades of tatty baroque churches rise like cliffs from the old stone propped up by scaffolding. Naples is the last great pagan city - of dolls, puppets, cards, magic and the significance of numbers, with which Neapolitans interpret dreams. Naples has a bright face but the Vesuvian city is ridden with the apocalyptic cult of death. After Maradona's Napoli won its first ever championship in 1987, graffiti appeared on the cemetery wall: 'You don't know what you missed.' Next day came the reply: 'Don't be so sure we missed it.' </p> <p>The Camorra was forged at the time of backlash against the revolutionary French republic of Naples. Into the vacuum between a liberal intelligentsia and reactionary elite, the Camorra moved as 'protection' for the masses in Europe's third city and, crucially, its biggest port, a portal for smugglers and extortionists. The Italian Mafia was first crushed by, then absorbed into, Mussolini's fascist regime. As Tom Behan writes in See Naples and Die, the rebirth of the modern Camorra was ironically due to the return of its Sicilian rival after the war. But the Camorra and Mafia were different - the former urban, the latter rural; the Neapolitans bound only by criminal commercial interest, the latter by family ties also. The Sicilians subscribed to a veneer of 'honour' to which the Camorra paid little heed. The Camorra has been more cynically flexible than Cosa Nostra, more fickle in its recruitment, loyalties and hostilities.</p> <p>Only one Camorra boss seriously allied himself to the Sicilians: Michele Zaza (aka Michel O'Pazz or Mad Mike), a shrewd smuggler-turned-gangster. Others saw no need to be bound to Cosa Nostra, markedly Raffaele Cutolo, who in the 1970s founded the New Organised Camorra, re-establishing Neapolitan control. The earthquake of 1980 relaunched the Camorra in terms of capital with some \u00a316bn earmarked for reconstruction siphoned off by gangsters and by politicians building themselves villas while some made homeless by the earthquake were still billeted in a lunatic asylum in Naples in 1993. The looted funds stoked the first Camorra civil war between Cutolo and the 'New Family' of clans led by Zaza and his heir, Carmine Alfieri. By 1991 a courageous Naples examining judge called Paolo Mancuso was able to tell me that the Camorra had overtaken Cosa Nostra as a criminal business operation but that 'what marks them out is that their legal income is now greater than their illegal one. The Camorra has become a social, financial and political institution.' </p> <p>The Camorra's coup was to realise that cocaine rather than heroin would become the drug of super-liquidity. They built international connections accordingly, in Colombia, Venezuela, Spain and along the French Riviera. They became the first capitalist operation to penetrate post-communist Eastern Europe, to deal in drugs, clothing and arms, in particular Kalashnikovs made under Soviet licence, with which the Camorra can now equip any army or militia suffering an embargo or supply problem. The profits were so great that the Camorra was obliged to invest imaginatively and semi-legally: in construction (it built much of the Costa del Sol), football pools and gambling, agriculture, car franchises, tourism, banks, social services, prostitution, waste disposal and textiles - even haute-couture, whether 'Made in Italy' or 'Made in China'. </p> <p>The Camorra had meanwhile entwined itself with senior Christian Democrats and other politicians to form a terrifying power machine in Naples. Thousands in Naples owed their livelihoods to either Byzantine political patronage or to the Camorra, or both. There were no rights, only privileges for those who paid the Camorra or a politician in cash or votes. </p> <p>Through the collapse of Christian Democracy and the advent of a leftist local authority and a right-wing Silvio Berlusconi to national government, the system remained intact. Saviano explains that few in Naples use the term 'Camorra' any more. The clans call themselves 'Sistema'- the System. It is impregnable, like cement, he says. </p> <p>'Cement' is the title of Saviano's chapter about his home town, the stuff of construction, legal or illegal, completed buildings or those left paid for but abandoned as concrete skeletons. 'Successful Italian businessmen come from cement,' says Saviano. 'Before transforming themselves into fashion models, managers, financial sharks and owners of newspapers and yachts, before all this and under all this lies cement.' The English translation, for some baffling reason, castrates the climax to this passage, which in Italian reads: cemento armato - armed cement. </p> <p>The last article I filed from Italy, in March 1994, concerned the Camorra's execution of Father Giuseppe Diana, or Don Peppino, as he prepared the host in his church in Casal di Principe. Saviano, then 16, knew him, and remembers the Christmas Day on which he distributed a tract defying the Camorra. It was the worst form of denunciation for murderers who think of themselves as Catholics. </p> <p>Saviano recalls how rival Casalesi clans, in order to show that the murder was not their doing, pledged to find the killer. Saviano, meanwhile, was thinking about the power of the word. 'While Don Peppino's assassins were talking about cutting up flesh to seal their position,' he wrote, in the book's pivotal passage, 'I was still thinking about the priest's battle and the primacy of the word... words against cement mixers and guns... to testify, take a stand. The only way to eliminate a word like that is to kill it.' Which is what the Camorra wants to do to Saviano, now it has disposed of Don Peppino. </p> <p>'If that book had sold 10,000 copies, they would not have had the slightest fear, and I would still have my freedom,' he says. 'But so many people have now read about who they are, and this they cannot forgive. They have been denied their romance.' </p> <p>Part of the book and all of the film is set in Secondigliano, heartland of the Camorra. That is where I found myself last week on Corso Secondigliano. Turn right at the heavily fortified 'Penitentiary Centre', and there they are: the Vele (the Sails, because of their shape), hideous blocks built in the 1960s, turned into the biggest drug marketplace in the world, and then its most ferocious criminal battlefield. This neighbourhood is called Scampia, one-time fiefdom of a man few outsiders had heard of until 1998, when a teacher ticked off his son's girlfriend for being lazy in school, and was beaten senseless. In 2002 police traced 160kg of heroin and cocaine to his door. A man called Paolo Di Lauro, aka Ciruzzo the Millionaire. </p> <p>Di Lauro's trafficking system was so pervasive that Saviano details a lucrative scheme for local pensioners, who could get a good return by putting their savings into cocaine. 'No substance gets introduced into the European market without first passing through Secondigliano,' writes Saviano, describing the squalid inferno of product tests carried out on pathetic addicts to gauge the effects of 'cutting' drugs, and then the war which followed a revolt against Di Lauro by lieutenants wanting a bigger share, and Di Lauro's terrible revenge.</p> <p>One ventures into the Vele with trepidation. Many of the apartments are empty, some burned out. But people are surprisingly ready to talk, not about the Camorra per se ('What Camorra?' says one man) but about the film. 'I was in it!' boasts a girl. 'In the bit when they kill the lady at the end! You can see me!' </p> <p>A woman whispers hoarsely on a stinking walkway between front doors: 'There is nothing that hasn't happened here. I read his book too. It's true, every word, God bless him.' </p> <p>'When the cameras arrived,' says Saviano, 'most people wanted to be part of it, to advise on how to make the film and get it right. Once the people had decided they wanted the film to be made there, there was nothing the Camorra could do. They didn't want this film but they had to allow it. That alone was something.' </p> <p>Casal di Principe is the fiefdom of the Casalesi clan and now-jailed boss Francesco Schiavone, called Sandokan after the pirate. He strangled the heir to the leadership with his bare hands at a cartel meeting, then became the mogul of Camorra construction, arms dealing and garbage disposal. I pull up at the Caffe Penelope, attacked by Sandokan's men during the Casalesi wars, and make some stupid remark in nostalgic praise of Maradona to a man at the bar reading a football paper. I ask if he has read Saviano's book. He stirs sugar into his coffee and replies with a nod, then a stare and silent grimace which says, today of all days, with those cops dead: 'Don't try to talk. Leave.' My appointment here with one of the bravest reporters in Italy, Rosaria Capacchione, has been postponed because of the car chase and three important arrests of Camorristi, which she must cover for her paper, Il Mattino. One of a roll of honour of brave writers on the Mafia, of whom Saviano is the most prominent, Rosaria works the area under police guard, and no wonder. Only the other day she was again singled out, along with Saviano, by lawyers for Camorristi in the dock at neighbouring Santa Maria Capua Vetere for her reporting on a trial. The Casalesi have wanted Rosaria dead since 1995 when she was tailed by gunmen after revealing the contents of two supergrass confessions against Sandokan while he was still at liberty.</p> <p>As Saviano says: 'The Mafia makes for the best and the worst. It's hard to find the best sometimes but it is there - the tenacity of the good people in this battle, which seems so hopeless. No Italian political party can fight an election campaign by going against the Mafia. Politics is an alibi - there is this idea that if you have politics that is corrupt you have the Mafia, and if you had clean politics, the Mafia would disappear. It's not like that. Political parties cannot rid us of the Camorra because the Camorra has no politics beyond the money it makes; no ideology apart from its business interests. This can only be done by getting at their economy and their roots in society. And the way to do this is by mobilising civil society, challenging the way they operate, refusing to take part.' </p> <p>In last week's L'espresso magazine Saviano lambasted the passive complicity of the city's middle class - Napoli Bene, as they are called - confronted in this particular case by a story linking the undersecretary of state for economy in Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet, Nicola Cosentino, and senior local politicians from his party, with the garbage disposal rackets run by the Camorra. Saviano says: 'The reaction of this strata [the middle class] has been \"So what?\" or \"Why should that amaze you - isn't that how things work?\" The professional ranks, the intellectuals, the employers - in short, the bourgeoisie of Campania which is always seen as a noble stratum - seems incapable of protesting.' </p> <p>'I have no illusions about the fascination with the Camorra, with the bosses,' concludes Saviano. 'To say they have no fascination is a lie. I'm not going to say that you don't earn more money or that you will not get more pretty women if you become a Camorrista. But what do you do then? You can't leave where you live, you can't talk to anyone apart from your own kind, and the only women you will meet are the ex-girlfriends of your own men.

  "<p>It was billed as the 'craziest and most exclusive car rally ever', a strictly invitation-only event in which wannabe playboys drove high-performance Ferraris, Porsches, Lamborghinis and Bentleys to Europe's most exotic cities, where they partied with glamour models as if the credit crunch had never happened.</p> <p>But yesterday the organisers of the Carbon Black rally, in which 60 drivers raced 30 vehicles across five countries from the UK to Monaco, experienced a different sort of crunch after two of their vehicles were involved in a collision while allegedly trying to outrun Italian police. Now the cars have been confiscated and the drivers fined.</p> <p>The crash has highlighted the increasingly high-risk nature of the unofficial road races that are alarming police on the continent, who say there are now around eight similar events each year. </p> <p>A burgeoning industry operating the events, which cost tens of thousands of pounds to participate in, has sprung up in the UK over the past decade. But as the events' profiles have increased, so, too, have the accidents. Last year, a husband and wife in Macedonia died when their VW Golf was hit by a Porsche 911 Carrera driven by two Britons competing in the better-known Gumball rally, whose celebrity participants have included Vic Reeves and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.</p> <p>This time the collision was of a more modest nature, although police say it could have been much worse. </p> <p>The crash happened after the drivers of three of the competing cars raced down a mountain motorway in Liguria, in north-west Italy. Startled motorists alerted police as a red Ferrari, a black Lamborghini Murcielago and a yellow Porsche 911 picked up speed just outside the village of Carrodano, where the road begins a steep descent into a series of tunnels and bridges on the way into Genoa. </p> <p>Clinging to rocks, the highway affords stunning views over the Mediterranean, but is often clogged with trucks and slow-moving traffic. As more motorists called in to express alarm, patrol cars picked up the trail of the super-cars that were reportedly swerving around the Italian drivers observing the 110kmh speed limit. </p> <p>In an alleged attempt to avoid the police, the Lamborghini veered off the road at an exit, slowing down rapidly to make a turn. Following closely, the \u00a3130,000 Porsche collided with the rear of the \u00a3200,000 super-car, while the Ferrari skipped the exit and sped off towards the French border. 'We hope to get him,' the officer said. 'A red Ferrari is more difficult to hide than a Fiat 500.'</p> <p>After confiscating the Porsche and the Lamborghini, Italian police condemned the drivers for 'threatening the lives' of other motorists, but praised their 'gentlemanly apologies and good behaviour'.</p> <p>The two men were stripped of their licences and face fines of up to \u20ac5,000, as well the permanent seizure of their cars. 'We have enough deaths on this road as it is,' the officer added. 'However polite these people are, they should know races belong on the racetrack.' </p> <p>Police said the two men, one believed to be in his forties and the other in his thirties, were calm as they climbed out of their mangled cars and tested negative for alcohol. According to the Carbon Black website, Mark Hinchcliffe from Surrey was listed as the main driver of the Porsche. The main driver of the Lamborghini, which is registered in Germany, is thought to come from Cheshire.</p> <p>'They were in a hurry to get to Monte Carlo and, after we had gone through the paperwork, an English friend in a Range Rover arrived to take them there,' said the officer. </p> <p>Perhaps it was no surprise the men were in a rush. The party in Monte Carlo promised to be one to remember, according to organisers. 'After dropping off the cars, we will set sail on board our very own luxury super-yacht, with the drinks flowing and the party pumping. We will watch the sun go down as we turn up the heat for the most extravagant party Carbon Black has ever staged!' the events organisers promised on their website.</p> <p>Carbon Black is owned by Paul 'Nods' Naden, a 39-year-old businessman who made a fortune selling his personal loans business. 'Carbon Black is strictly invitation-only and provides a more exhilarating, exclusive and extravagant alternative to other over-commercialised rallies,' it boasts on its website.</p> <p>Naden is clearly turning his pleasure into a business. According to one report, he owns four Ferraris, three Lamborghinis, two Porsches and a Bentley Continental GT. He also has a property in the luxury Sandbanks complex in Dorset. In addition to Carbon Black, he owns a stake in a Serbian steel factory and his portfolio includes properties in the UK and eastern Europe, a golf course in South Africa and a lingerie business. </p> <p>'Money is a measure of success, but it's the challenge of being the best that I enjoy the most,' he said in one interview.</p> <p>Carbon Black seems to reflect his luxurious tastes. A sophisticated internet site and a satellite tracking system allow fans to follow the race and watch video clips and photos of the cars and parties. Other vehicles competing in the race include a McLaren SLR, Porsche Cayenne and an Audi R8.</p> <p>Starting out at a stately home, Stapleford Park in Leicestershire, competitors enjoyed archery and clay pigeon shooting before they were flown by private jet to Prague for a night of 'chilled' partying. Then it was a race to Budapest, where the competitors were booked into what organisers describe as the city's 'hippest' fusion restaurant, before making the journey into Italy. </p> <p>Along the way, drivers were joined by an array of lingerie models who helped them party at the end of each day. Carbon Black's website shows the women in a variety of poses and outfits and boasts their parties are 'like no other'. A promotional video promises this year's event would deliver even more 'wild times' than the rally last year across Eastern Europe.</p> <p>But such antics are starting to provoke a backlash. The events' image as an extended jolly for privileged trustafarians who show little concern for speed limits has seen them lose some of their allure. </p> <p>Following the fatal collision last year, the Gumball rally was temporarily scrapped. An internet hate campaign sprang up against the event, which was quickly relabelled 'Scumball', and authorities in Germany and Turkey subsequently banned it. Nicholas Morley, a property developer, received a suspended sentence for his part in the fatal crash. His brother, Oliver, was participating in this year's Carbon Black event.</p> <p>There are suggestions that similar events, such as the Bullrun in the United States and Carbon Black, may have been tarnished by such negative publicity. Indeed it is not the first time the Carbon Black rally has found itself attracting headlines for the wrong reasons. Two years ago, seven of its competitors were fined for driving at up to 200kph on motorways in south-west France, where the speed limit is 130kph.</p> <p>Yesterday a spokeswoman for Carbon Black declined to comment on the latest controversy to befall the company. Naden, she said, could not be contacted. </p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting by Hannah Gousy</p>",
  "<p>Wolves, who lost their unbeaten Championship record in midweek, suffered another blow as they conceded three goals again in a 3-1 defeat at <strong>Swansea</strong>.</p> <p>Swansea took only 26 seconds to open the scoring, with Jordi G\u00f3mez taking a pass from Andrea Orlandi and firing a low shot past the keeper. Wolves responded in positive fashion through an Andy Keogh equaliser, but they were then destroyed by two goals from Jason Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Reading</strong>'s 3-1 home win over <strong>Burnley</strong>, which ended the visitors' seven-match unbeaten league record, provided further evidence of the influence of their Republic of Ireland international right-winger Stephen Hunt. According to Reading manager Steve Coppell, none of his players has shown greater determination to get back into the Premier League than Hunt. 'He has no respect for his opponents,' Coppell said. 'He showed that in the Premier League last season and he has continued in the same way. It just doesn't matter who he is up against. He plays flat out in an old-fashioned way, and the fans love that.' </p> <p>Hunt has transformed himself since being given a free transfer by Brentford three years ago. He recalled: 'I was disappointed the way I left there as I had a lot of affection for the club, but the manager [Martin Allen] didn't really believe I had an injury when I was sidelined and I went through stuff that toughened me up and made me stronger mentally.'</p> <p>Hunt's impressive form this season has been highlighted by the number of goals Reading have scored from his set pieces, especially his corners. Striker Kevin Doyle, the main beneficiary of this aspect of Hunt's game, says: 'His accuracy is remarkable. He seems to be able to put the ball in exactly the same spot from every corner.'</p> <p>His brother Noel Hunt scored the first goal against Burnley, from a Jimmy K\u00e9b\u00e9 cross. But with Burnley threatening to get back into the game, Stephen Hunt made it 2-0. With Shane Long scoring Reading's third goal, the one from Burnley's Chris McCann was no more than a consolation. </p> <p>The pressure on <strong>Barnsley</strong> manager Simon Davey to give some of their fans the sort of excitement they experienced during the team's FA Cup run last season was eased when they came from behind to thrash <strong>Doncaster</strong> 4-1. Barnsley, one of the lowest-scoring sides in the country, fell behind through a Brian Stock penalty after Barnsley captain Stephen Foster had needlessly pushed Lewis Guy. Barnsley were then reduced to 10 men following Darren Moore's red card, but Foster made amends by getting Barnsley's equaliser and their other scorers were Jamal Campbell-R yce, Jon Macken and Iain Hume. </p> <p><strong>Nottingham Forest</strong> 's position at the bottom of the table became more pronounced when they fell 2-0 at home to <strong>Crystal Palace</strong> - the latter's first away league win of the season. Palace went ahead through Paul Ifill, following an excellent Ben Watson free-kick, and Shefki Kuqi scored their second goal.</p> <p><strong>Derby</strong> recovered from the blow of their keeper, Roy Carroll, being sent off - when they were 1-0 ahead - to beat <strong>Norwich</strong> 2-1. Carroll was shown the red card for a professional foul, which was followed by Sammy Clingan getting Norwich's penalty equaliser. But Derby got their noses in front again through Nathan Ellington. </p> <p>One of the best goals - not to mention one of the most dramatic - came from <strong>Blackpool</strong> substitute Alan Gow in the 1-1 draw at home to <strong>Cardiff</strong></p> <p>The visitors looked to be heading for a deserved win when their substitute Paul Parry curled in a fine effort seven minutes from the end, but midfielder Gow responded with a superb left-footed shot from 20 yards in the fifth minute of stoppage time. It was Gow's first goal for Blackpool following his loan transfer from Rangers at the start of last month.</p> <p>The first-ever Football League match before a sell-out crowd at London Road - albeit one of only 13,100 - was marked by <strong>Peterborough</strong> beating <strong>Leeds</strong>, the League One title favourites, 2-0. Peterborough got their first goal just after the interval following an excellent exchange involving Russell Martin and Shaun Batt on the right flank, before Batt's cross was driven back across the goal by Dominic Green and George Boyd did the rest. </p> <p>Leeds claimed that Green had handled the ball, but they clearly had nothing to complain about when Craig Mackail-Smith added the other Posh goal, following more good work by Martin.</p> <p><strong>Leicester</strong>, the leaders, squandered a 2-0 lead at <strong>Huddersfield</strong> but claimed all three points with a winner from Lloyd Dyer. The hype over Robbie Savage's Brighton debut was forgotten as Glenn Murray stole his thunder with a hat-trick in the 3-3 draw against <strong>Cheltenham</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Rotherham</strong>, who started the season with a 17-point deduction, got themselves to the plus-one point stage as they came from behind for a 3-1 win over struggling <strong>Grimsby</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's first Muslim minister, Shahid Malik, has been promoted to the department of justice as part of Gordon Brown's cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>The Dewsbury MP, who is currently a minister for international development, said he hoped to make Britain \"a more just society\" in his new role as a minister in the department for justice. </p> <p>\"While I have truly loved my international role working to deliver justice for the poorest around the world, I'm now relishing the opportunity to make Britain an even fairer and more just society for all its citizens,\" he said.</p> <p>As an MP, Malik gained experience of violent youth crime in Britain when a teenager was murdered by a gang of young people in his constituency in May this year. </p> <p>After the killing, the MP, who lives just a few minutes walk from the scene of the attack, called for \"a change in society\", warning that too many young people were adopting a culture where violence was an accepted part of life.</p> <p>In another government move, Tom Harris, transport minister, has been sacked. The Glasgow South MP said: \"Obviously I'm disappointed; I really enjoyed being a minister. But I was always realistic - ministerial jobs come and go, but the role of an MP is more important than any other. And of course I will continue to support the government from the backbenches.\" </p> <p>The finishing touches to the government reshuffle are being announced over the weekend. The posts of immigration minister and police minister at the Home Office have yet to be filled. </p> <p>A number of senior ministers have today been speaking out in support of Peter Mandelson, who has been brought back to the cabinet as business secretary. </p> <p>Ed Miliband, who was appointed to the new post of Energy and Climate Change Secretary in yesterday's reshuffle, said Mandelson would make the government \"stronger\".</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: \"Peter Mandelson has people who like him and people who don't like him, but even his critics would accept that this is someone of immense talent and someone of even greater experience now that he has been the EU Trade Commissioner for three years.\"</p> <p>Ed Balls, the schools secretary, described Mandelson's appointment as \"the right thing to do\".</p>",
  "<p>Imagine the mess we'd be in, I found myself thinking, if the Labour party hadn't been wound up in 1983. It was one of those idle \"counterfactual\" reveries we historians indulge in during momentous events like our current crisis of capitalism. Remember that time 25 years ago when the British progressive left realigned, in the wake of Thatcher's second and most decisive general election victory. The 1980s seem so long ago, so it's worth recapping just what happened then, if only to put in sharper relief what might have happened since, had Britain become part of the \"new Europe\" outpost of American neoliberalism about to be thrown to the wolves of \"market readjustment\".</p> <p>Michael Foot resigned as Labour leader, still clutching <a href=\"http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/man/lab83.htm\">the longest suicide note in history</a>. Torn between hard left and demoralised right, Labour couldn't decide how to elect a new leader, let alone who it might be. The \"new realists\" in the trade unions, quick to spot a bad deal, decided they'd had enough. The curious historical phenomenon of Labourism \u2013 Britain's very own historic compromise between capitalism and the working class \u2013 had run its course. The unions withdrew their money and support from the old party, rendering it financially and organisationally unsustainable. As eminent historian Eric Hobsbawm pointed out, the social and cultural roots of Labour among the huge but essentially subordinate British working class had begun to wither at least 30 years before.</p> <p>It took a lot of painful haggling, but eventually a new Progressive Alliance took shape on the left, comprising the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDP-Liberal_Alliance\">SDP-Liberal Alliance</a> (excluding the Owenite \"social marketeers\", who were absorbed by the Thatcherites), Labour's \"democratic left\" around Bryan Gould, the small but influential \"Euro-communist\" wing of the Communist party, the \"realo-s\" of the Green party, and even some of the more thoughtful \"wet\" Tories. It was strongly pro-European, anti-nuclear weapons in principle but flexible on detail, committed to decentralisation of the public services and constitutional modernisation (including proportional representation for every election), and determined to make private business fulfil its social responsibilities. It recognised that the more populist elements of Thatcherism \u2013 council house sales, for example \u2013 would be difficult to reverse, but argued that they should be counterbalanced by policies to promote equality and social mobility, with an honestly redistributive tax system and Scandinavian-scale public spending and welfare.</p> <p>Thatcher won in 1987, at the height of City deregulation and the privatisation boom, but by 1992 the Tories were exhausted. The progressive alliance \u2013 confident in strategy, policies, image, local base and national leadership \u2013 was able to form a new government. The first few years were difficult, as powerful City and media interests did as much as they could to undermine it. But the government's programme of \"Red-Green Austerity\", with fairer distribution of wealth and resources and managed, environmentally-friendly reining-in of economic growth, and above all improved work-life balance, won overwhelming public support. People realised that a slower, gentler, more sociable way of life was much better than the rat-race of unbridled capitalism.</p> <p>The small rump of New Labour MPs from the old Labour heartlands was reduced to criticising the new government on the basis that, with its neo-protectionist economic policies, it couldn't bring Britain the benefits of globalisation. Their working class constituents \u2013 primary beneficiaries of the new quality of life \u2013 soon saw through that, and New Labour was forced to join the Progressive Alliance as a very junior partner. Gordon Brown was, briefly, a parliamentary under-secretary.</p> <p>Now look at the turmoil in \"new Europe\", and imagine how things might have turned out for us if the PA hadn't effectively quarantined the City of London from the real economy of Great Britain. Our revived and modernised manufacturing base, our rational and manageable housing market, our self-sufficient and nearly carbon-neutral energy and transport systems, our democratised and reinvigorated health and education services (with physical fitness, mental health and genuine educational achievement rising at historic rates across all ages and classes), our training-centred labour market and points-based immigration system, not to mention the broader cultural and social improvements in the way we regard and treat our fellow citizens, would all be at serious risk. Thank goodness \u2013 and the 1983 trade union \"new realists\" \u2013 that they're not.</p> <p><em>Is the future Conservative?, a debate by Comment is free &amp; Soundings magazine will take place in London at Kings Place on October 6 at 7pm.
