  "<p>A migrant worker has admitted mutilating and murdering a woman whose head was found wrapped in a black plastic bag by children on a beach in Scotland. </p> <p>Aleksandras Skirda, 19, pleaded guilty in the high court in Edinburgh yesterday to torturing and killing Lithuanian farm worker Jolanta Bledaite at her home in Brechin, Angus, in March, and then using her bank cards to steal \u00a31,400 from cash machines in several nearby towns.</p> <p>He butchered her body, dropping her remains into Arbroath harbour, and then threw her torso hidden inside a suitcase into the sea at the same place the following day. Bledaite's severed head was found by two sisters aged 8 and 11 as they played on Arbroath beach the next day. The police found her severed hands nearby and her body in the suitcase.</p> <p>Skirda's admissions came at a pre-trial hearing in open court before Lord Uist, where it emerged that he is expected to give evidence against his co-accused, fellow Lithuanian Vitas Plytnykas, 41, when the case comes to trial in February.</p> <p>Plytnykas yesterday submitted a \"special defence\", the legal term in Scottish courts for an alibi or incriminating another, claiming that Skirda was solely responsible for murdering Bledaite. </p> <p>He denies all the charges, including allegations that he cleared Bledaite's possessions out of her flat, burned her papers and belongings and threw a knife into a nearby river. Lord Uist told Skirda, who has no previous convictions, that he can expect a life sentence.</p>",
  "<p>Jon Cruddas is right to highlight the government's failure to make a decision on the future of the post office card account (Poca), and the devastating effect that the loss of the Poca contract would have on what remains of the post office network (A ready made People's Bank, October 13). Card account transactions bring in an average of \u00a3249 income for sub-postmasters per month, accounting for 10% of their net pay. The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters has warned that a further 3,000 post offices could be forced to close if the government does not award the Poca contract to Post Office Ltd, in addition to the 2,500 branches which have already closed. </p> <p>Cruddas may not be aware that one political party has already warned of the devastation that would be wreaked by awarding the Poca contract to anyone but Post Office Ltd, and which has pledged to increase the functionality of the card account. A Conservative government would reform Pocas to enable people on lower incomes to benefit from the lower energy and water tariffs enjoyed by customers paying by direct debit.</p> <p>Approximately 8 million people in the UK do not have a bank account or \"act as unbanked\", withdrawing all their cash weekly. Many of these use a Poca. We would enhance Pocas so they can be used to pay utility bills by direct debit, cutting the bills of up to 2 million people by up to \u00a3200 a year, as well as generating new income for post offices. The government has rejected this policy because it contradicts its policy of managing the decline of the post office network, rather than developing new revenue streams. Cruddas will hopefully now join us in calling on them to reconsider.<br><strong>Alan Duncan MP</strong><br>Shadow secretary of state for business </p> <p>I have never understood how the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) could claim to control inflation without including house prices within its remit. Its purpose has been to focus on the consumer prices index, which excludes the costs of housing.</p> <p>Homes, our most expensive purchase, inflated madly; yet the government and the MPC boasted for many years that they were keeping inflation down. They were not telling us the whole truth.</p> <p>Now that the elephant in the room has crashed through the floor, I hope this will serve as a warning to future chancellors that they cannot ignore house prices when assessing inflation. The Bank should change to an inflation target that uses the retail prices index.<br><strong>Dr Amanda Goodall</strong><br>Warwick Business School </p> <p>According to Jackie Ashley (Comment, October 13), for much of Labour's period in office, Gordon Brown has been weighed down by the burden of asking what he was for. Now he knows. Or we hope that he knows: could it be that he's best at clearing up his own messes?</p> <p>In 1998 it was plain that the City, bankers and anyone else concerned with the greedy business of money \"making\" money would also have free licence to seduce the UK into an almighty addiction to debt. All the time, Brown looked the other way - to the detriment of several potentially radical policies, including ending child poverty. Now, political commentators appear to be swallowing the government propaganda line that Brown has only freshly arrived centre stage. Ashley writes: \"Brown has not yet spoken to the country as he ought to ... There was never a greater need for the right words, well spoken.\" Two from Brown will suffice: mea culpa.<br><strong>Yvonne Roberts</strong><br>London </p> <p>Your mini-profiles of the big four banks' CEOs include a line saying how much each of them \"earned\" last year. I think you mean \"got paid\". It is impossible to imagine any merit, effort or action on the part of these bankers that would justify saying they \"earned\" the seven-figure sums you report.<br><strong>David Hopson</strong><br>West Wittering, West Sussex </p> <p>Now that Gordon Brown has implemented some of Michael Foot's 1983 manifesto, in particular the nationalisation of banks, which was laughed at by the rightwing electorate, perhaps the prime minister will appear at the Cenotaph in November sporting a green duffel coat.<br><strong>Dennis Ruston<br></strong>Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire</p>",
  "<p>I was an ardent Anglophile until I moved to London. That was when I found out that having loved British culture since teenhood and been on vacation here a few times was no preparation for living here. Everything that had seemed exciting and fascinating about Britain when viewed from across the Atlantic was much less so up close when I arrived in 1982, dragging along a pink holdall packed with a flouncy vintage wardrobe and enough money to last six months. I had assumed that knowing everything there was to know about UK pop music was the only qualification I needed to feel at home in London and start a life here. How wrong could I have been?</p> <p>I'd been working as a waitress in a cocktail bar (someone should really make a song out of that) in New York, devoting my spare time to seeing gigs by British bands and buying their records from import shops. With no particular career ties to New York, I decided one New Year's Eve to go to my favourite city to live like a Londoner for a while. Ten months later, after saving $3,000, I arrived at Heathrow on an overcast October day.</p> <p>Hardly anything was as I'd expected. Spending the first three months on friends' sofas, then moving into a house-share in Deptford, south-east London, opened my eyes. And what I was learning, I didn't like. Everyday life wasn't the whirl of bands and stylishness I'd envisaged; it was perpetually grey skies, aloof people who resisted my overtures of friendship and a freezing house with the toilet in the backyard (this detail shocked me more than almost anything else; even more incredibly, my three housemates - all Brits - didn't seem to mind). </p> <p>Within a couple of months, I caught a cold that refused to go away, and I spent the next year snuffling into a hankie. With nothing to do during the day, when my housemates were at college, I rode around on buses and tubes to see where they went, then felt depressed by what I found: semi-detached 1930s suburbs that stretched to the horizon. Plodding around Epping or Uxbridge in the middle of a weekday, I couldn't get my head around the idea that Britain was not the arty wonderland of my delusions but, well, this.</p> <p>Why was everything so drab? How did people stand the dreariness? And, most frustratingly, why were they so resistant to getting to know people outside their usual social circle (ie me)? \"Yeah, but we're not shallow like Americans,\" one of my housemates \"explained\" when I asked. \"When you do become friends with a British person, they're your friend for life.\" Fantastic, but what did you do until the British person decided they'd known you long enough to admit you to their gang?</p> <p>What really brought me up short were the miners' and the Wapping printers' strikes. I just didn't get them. No American industrial dispute in my lifetime had riven the country as these did, and, ignorant of the background issues, I couldn't understand why they roused everyone I knew to such a pitch of (mainly anti-Tory) emotion. I knew nothing of British politics and social structures, why people were judged by their accents or why class was mentioned so often in newspaper leader articles.</p> <p>Young people were much more politicised than my friends at home, and took it as read that I was, too. \"Aren't you ashamed of what Reagan is doing?\" I was asked more than once - a question I couldn't answer, having spent most of his presidency pretty well oblivious to him. I'd come to England armed with only one fact about the UK government: that the prime minister was a woman, which seemed an excellent thing. As for the royal family, I had republican sentiments, insofar as they went, and instinctively hated the tabloids' deference to them. But it took a long time to unravel the ins and outs of it all, and while I slowly learned that the privatisation of national industries was a bad thing, and Margaret Thatcher and John Major even worse, my British friends - I'd finally made some - treated me </p> <p>with the condescension of people who knew their country was morally and culturally superior to mine.</p> <p>So you'll appreciate that I was almost entirely unsuited to living in England. Yet I refused to go back to New York. I was here, and I was going to stay here and figure the damned place out if it killed me. A member of my family was English, and I was able to get leave to remain. Ambivalently settled into long-term residency, I adopted a PJ O'Rourke-like bullishness about my Americanness. In his 1988 book of travel essays, Holidays in Hell, the Ohio-born journalist addresses a rant to a British acquaintance who had complained that Americans saw war as a John Wayne movie: \"We think war is a John Wayne movie. We think life is a John Wayne movie - with good guys and bad guys, as simple as that. And let me tell you who those bad guys are. They're us. WE BE BAD.\" </p> <p>As America's image went downhill through the 90s, I felt compelled to defend it, PJ-style. Don't diss my country, OK? And then 10 years had passed, and I was still here, but something else had taken root alongside the defensiveness. I could appreciate things now: the quiet beauty of the countryside, which had got under my skin and made me want to protect it; London's scruffy complexity, and the way most of its inhabitants good-naturedly put up with each other; the feeling that even if this is a sinking ship, it'll go down with humour and irony intact. Everything that had originally seemed shabby and desperate now felt comforting and homely. When Madonna refused to give birth to her second child in London because she considered the hospitals \"old and Victorian\", I was outraged. I knew how they appeared in her eyes, but also that if it had been me, I wouldn't have wanted to have the baby anywhere but my local King's College Hospital in south London (opened 1909), with its exemplary staff. I'd met some of them when I spent five days there with a broken knee, and thought them wonderful. Back in New York, my mother, who was socked with hefty health-insurance premiums every month, marvelled at the idea that the NHS had fixed my knee for free. \"They didn't charge you anything?\" she kept asking.</p> <p>I had even developed a fondness for the Queen - not the institution she represents, but the woman herself - as the one constant in my two decades here. And with all that came awareness that I loved this country. Around this time, about two years ago, I began to think about applying for citizenship. It would make my attachment to London feel complete - like getting married after lengthy cohabitation. And it would be a statement of commitment.</p> <p>When I found out how laborious the application process is, it took another year to get around to it. There's a 20-page form requiring two British referees, details of every absence from the country in the past five years and a tonne of documents, including tax returns and passport. But before you can send it, you need to pass the Life in the UK test, which was introduced in 2005 to ensure applicants had a grasp of what Britishness was about. My test centre was on a Clapham industrial estate, where 25 of us - a mix of South Americans, Africans and a sweet Iraqi guy who was taking it for the third time - were sitting in front of computers to answer the 24 questions. Bags had to be left on a table, and phones switched off. We were warned that if a phone rang during the test, its owner would automatically fail. </p> <p>We also agreed not to disclose details of the questions, so all I can say is: I'd thought 20 years of living here meant I'd sail through, but I was wrong. Now I understand why almost 200,000 of the 650,000 tests taken so far have ended in failure. I was expecting gifts such as, \"Who is the heir to the throne?\" but this was really tough. Despite a week swotting up with the official preparation guide (\u00a310 from WH Smith), I was flummoxed by half the questions. So much for 20 years.</p> <p>I passed, though, and duly sent everything to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, with a cheque for \u00a3655 (increased from around \u00a3250 in 2006). Four months later, the IND replied, saying my application had been approved. And two weeks ago, at a ceremony for 40 of us at Lambeth Town Hall, I became British. </p> <p>The Mayor of Lambeth presided as we recited an affirmation of loyalty to the Queen, tinnily accompanied by a taped version of the national anthem. Then the mayor, who wore leisure slacks under her impressive robes, presented us with citizenship certificates. In the queue, I had a Turkish woman in front of me and a Colombian man behind, illustrating as well as anything the breadth of cultures drawn to this fantastic city. </p> <p>We had to speak over the noise of drilling outside, and Sellotape was peeling away from a picture of the Queen stuck to a curtain at the front of the room. Twenty years ago, the mildly shambolic state of it would have appalled me. Now I felt a surge of fondness at the Britishness of it all. When I got home, feeling slightly giddy, my housemate asked how my \"investiture\" had gone, and has since taken to calling me Sir Caroline. And my friend Amber gave me a card saying, \"Now you have to have a kebab and a fight to celebrate!\" It looks like I'm finally in the gang.</p>",
  "<p>\"Life's not fair\" - that was the advice the feminist, economist and socialist Irene Bruegel, who has died aged 62, gave to her children. She deployed her prodigious appetite for life to fight for equality and against injustice, inspiring and cajoling others to do likewise until a chronic liver disorder stopped her. In 2002, she founded Jews for Justice for Palestinians (JfJfP), today one of the largest and most influential of Jewish voices against the Israeli occupation.</p> <p>Irene was born in London to German-speaking Jewish social democrat refugee parents. The family returned to Prague while she was still a baby, but her parents had to flee soon after without her, and it took some time before they were reunited in north London. Other refugees often passed through that intensely political household, an experience that fuelled Irene's drive to fight for the dispossessed.</p> <p>She attended Henrietta Barnett and South Hampstead high schools before studying economics at Sussex University (1964-67) and taking an MA in urban planning at University College London. Her career spanned education, policy research and local government. Her first job was at the Centre for Urban and Regional Studies in Birmingham (1968-70), followed by a year at the Centre for Environmental Studies, Lanchester Polytechnic and the Architectural Association (1971-76), what was then North East London Polytechnic (1976-80), the National Children's Bureau (1980-83), the Greater London Council in its glory days until it was abolished by the Thatcher government in 1986, the Centre for Local Economic Strategies in Manchester (1986), the London Strategic Policy Unit (1986-87) and the London borough of Ealing (1987-89). </p> <p>She returned to academia at South Bank University in 1990, where she was promoted to reader in urban policy in 1995 and professor in 2000. Since her retirement in December 2006, she had taught an evening course at Birkbeck College on researching London's localities, a subject she loved.</p> <p>Irene was a gifted teacher who expected high standards from students, while understanding their needs and never patronising them if they did not have conventional qualifications or felt unsure about whether they belonged in a university. As a researcher, she never lost sight of the big picture, though her work was meticulously grounded empirically. She made a significant contribution to the understanding of gender and class as a system spanning both the labour market and the family.</p> <p>All the while, Irene was politically active - starting with the Young Socialists, the Labour party, and the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign. She was part of the 1970 Ruskin conference that founded the new women's movement in the UK, and was active in campaigns for equal pay and abortion rights. She took part in debates about the relationship between feminism and socialism, and scorned the idea that one had to trump the other.</p> <p>In the 1960s, she joined the International Socialism group (now the Socialist Workers party), which provided the framework for her activism for more than a decade in trade unions, the Conference of Socialist Economists, and other organisations. But Irene never subordinated her free-thinking to demands for political orthodoxy, and, as the space for debate within IS/SWP shrank, she grew increasingly distanced from it. The final straw was its hostility to autonomous women's organisation, and she left in 1979. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, she rejoined the Labour party, but quit over the first Gulf war. She supported Women in Black for Justice against War, the European Forum of Socialist-Feminists, and more recently campaigns over adult education, the treatment of refugees and the impact of climate change. Local issues were also important, such as a fight against London Underground's refusal to renew a local dry cleaner's lease, and she hurled herself into a campaign to keep her beloved ladies' pond on Hampstead Heath open and free.</p> <p>After visiting the West Bank in 2001, she rounded up some dozen like-minded Jewish friends, mostly women, to found the JfJfP to campaign for an end to the Israeli occupation and a just settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Now more than 1,300 strong, the group has been instrumental in shattering the illusion that all Jews unconditionally support the Israeli government.</p> <p>Irene's partner, Richard Kuper, was JfJfP's co-founder. Theirs was a remarkable relationship; each was intellectually autonomous, but they often worked together. They also raised four children in a highly political, intellectually vibrant household that welcomed activists from all over the world with Irene's wonderful soups and cheesecake.</p> <p>No matter how much Irene persuaded her friends to do, she would always be doing more - too much, as it turned out. But somehow she managed to reconcile being in a rush with always having time for people, and never made one feel small for not managing the level of activity that she did. She died peacefully, surrounded by her family: Richard, her children Dan and Jo, and stepchildren Martin and David. Her rare gift for friendship transcended political and intellectual differences, and she would have been astonished and delighted at the huge turnout at her funeral.</p> <p>\u2022 Irene Bruegel, academic and activist, born November 7 1945; died October 6 2008</p>",
  "<p>Once notorious for its slums, gangs and industrial dereliction, Glasgow's resurrection as one of the country's trendiest and liveliest cities has been confirmed. </p> <p>The travel guide Lonely Planet has confounded the sceptics who disparage the city for its hard-drinking, violent reputation by claiming it is one of the world's top 10 cities for visitors - on a par with Chicago, Lisbon and Mexico City.

  "<p>All credit to the Guardian for giving a higher profile to Black History Month (Black history timeline, October 13-17). I hope it stimulates further attention and debate - what has been missed and what should be added chief among them. My nomination for key figures is Thurgood Marshall, special counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People - which celebrates its centenary next year - and director-counsel of the NAACP's legal defence fund from 1940-61. During those years, Marshall chiselled away at the legal foundations of segregation, culminating in the landmark 1954 Brown v Board of Education school desegregation case. In 1967, he was appointed the first black US supreme court justice by President Johnson. Without Marshall and the defence fund's work, Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement may not have emerged when and as successfully as they did.<br><strong>Professor John Kirk</strong><br>Royal Holloway, University of London </p> <p>I am delighted with the Black History Month initiative, both online and in the newspaper.

  "<p>The revival of the markets has postponed the sensation that violent revolution is imminent. No longer are the sages telling us the entire system is minutes away from total collapse. The first aid, devised by Gordon Brown and hailed and emulated from the US to the eurozone, seems to have soothed the fevered brow of the moneymen. For now at least. </p> <p>Still, even if the mob is not about to storm finance ministries from Paris to Washington, few doubt that we are witnessing an epochal event, living through one of those moments on which history pivots. Newsweek International editor Fareed Zakaria writes that he had always wanted to experience the kind of event \"one reads about in books. Well, this is it\". In the Financial Times, Philip Stephens says that two centuries of US and European domination are now at an end, as the western economic model is humbled. Robert Peston announces the end of the Thatcherite age. On these pages yesterday Steve Bell consigned the lady herself to the dustbin of history. </p> <p>Of course, these verdicts might turn out to be overblown. Some are counselling that the great turmoil of 2008 will turn out to be less tempestuous than advertised. For one thing, the Brownian notion of part-nationalising the banks could work, turning what would have been a major depression into a mere, if harsh, recession. In that case, the political impact would surely be muted. The ground was laid for Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal not simply by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, but the lines of the destitute queueing for a bowl of soup. In this view, a convulsion to the financial system will not, by itself, be enough to usher in a new political era; not unless the tremors shake the real-world economy and society along with it. </p> <p>Still, let's accept that the events of the past few week are indeed epochal. Most are quite clear on what has ended: the era of let-it-rip, unfettered market capitalism has surely drawn to a close. As Andrew Simms, policy director of the New Economics Foundation, puts it: \"This is to finance-driven capitalism what 1989 was to Soviet communism.\" In both cases, too much unaccountable power had concentrated in too few hands, with too little transparency, as those in charge lived in a financial fantasy land, playing with numbers wholly detached from productive economic activity.</p> <p>If that's now all over, what's coming next? The first shift might be a radically different approach to public spending. Now that they have seen their governments spend eye-popping sums of money to get out of a crisis, won't voters demand similar largesse to solve other pressing problems? For decades, politicians have told constituents that there simply isn't the cash to pay for, say, the \u00a33bn that would be needed to halve child poverty by 2010, or the annual \u00a38bn it would take to get 20% of our energy from renewable sources. Now, though, those look like paltry sums next to the \u00a337bn the government plans to inject into Britain's ailing banks. Saving post office branches in deprived areas at a cost of \u00a3150m? Small change! In this way, the rhetoric of public discussion on spending could change drastically, with voters' patience for arguments of prudence evaporated. \"If you could find the money to clear up the mess left by a few greedy fat cats,\" voters will say, \"then you can find the money to fund this bus service/save this village school/renationalise the railways.\"</p> <p>Or it could go the other way. The politicians may find that, though the public mood becomes more conducive to active, high-spending government, they simply lack the means to pay for any of it. They will have already borrowed to the hilt for the banks bail-out and will have nothing left, resources further depleted by the coming recession. In this atmosphere of fiscal tightness, ministers could skirt round vexed ideological terrain and simply plead poverty. There would be no need for an embarrassing U-turn on, say, the principle of ID cards: Jacqui Smith could say she still thinks they are a good idea but, at an estimated \u00a36bn or more, we simply cannot afford them. Ditto Trident renewal: Brown could insist he maintains his faith in nukes but say that at, \u00a320bn, revamped weaponry is a luxury Britain cannot afford. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the public failure of unregulated free markets has been so visible it could lead to a demand that financial institutions now operate by criteria other than the narrow, selfish measure of their own bottom line, taking into account the wider needs of society as a whole. If that sounds like woolly, hopelessly utopian thinking, consider this. RBS is set to be majority-owned by you and me, the taxpayer. HBOS is not far off. Now what will those banks do when faced with people falling behind on their mortgage payments? In the past they would have ordered repossession, which made sense in terms of pure profit and loss. But now there will be other factors to consider, because these banks will no longer work solely for dividend-hungry shareholders but for the taxpayer. Every family that has endured a repossession costs the public purse, through rehousing, most obviously, but in myriad and less visible ways - right down to the burden that falls on the NHS as it repairs the mental and emotional damage inflicted by forced eviction. </p> <p>Now since RBS's imminent owners - us - have to pay those bills as well, we will surely demand that the bank slow down rather than move in for the kill, perhaps through restructuring the debt of that struggling homeowner or at least running a \"full-impact assessment\" of repossession. The government already promises to impose demands on the banks they part-own, including gentler treatment of small businesses. But once taxpayers realise their new-found power, there is no reason to assume it will be confined to just those areas. We could insist the banks we partly own behave in an entirely new way. </p> <p>No less clear a lesson of 2008 is that we have to live much more closely within our means. That must apply to individuals, reining in the credit- card habits of the past decade, and to governments who have perpetuated what Zakaria calls \"a great fraud\", spending ever more without raising taxes. The result in the US is a national debt of $10.2 trillion. </p> <p>That act of denial has to end now. It will mean either cutting back on spending or increasing taxes, or both. But that needn't be as gloomy as it sounds. Revenues could rise by taxing those things we want to see the back of anyway: starting with a windfall tax on the energy companies, penalising them for their reliance on fossil fuels. As for spending, we could shed the waste - ID cards and Trident renewal - and spend what we have on a massive effort to green our society, from home to factory. That would obey classic New Deal logic, providing jobs, helping those in fuel poverty, tackling climate change and keeping the economy ticking over - all at the same time.</p> <p>Simms at the NEF thinks we may end up going further, moving to shorter working weeks as people accept that they will earn less and consume less - but will have more time for family, friends and life. That seems like a radical fantasy now, but who knows? For when old dogmas die, there is room for all kinds of new thinking.

  "<p>Not long after I took office as Mexico's foreign minister in 2001, a novel problem came across my desk. An Argentine naval officer who had resettled in Mexico under an assumed name was wanted by Spain on charges of genocide, torture, and terrorism. The officer, <a href=\"http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR410042001?open&amp;of=ENG-MEX\">Ricardo Miguel Cavallo</a>, was implicated in abuses committed in 1977 and 1978 at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War\">notorious Naval Mechanics School</a> in Buenos Aires. According to the Spanish indictment, Cavallo belonged to the operations unit of a group actively involved in kidnapping and torturing people whom the military regime perceived as leftist.</p> <p>The question before me was whether to extradite Cavallo to Spain, a third country, to face trial for human rights abuses committed in Argentina. Signing the papers would be groundbreaking, as it would signal for the first time that suspected rights abusers might face trial anywhere in the world if justice was not likely at home. </p> <p>For me, the decision was straightforward: the crimes demanded justice, and Cavallo was more likely to be held to account in Spain than in Argentina. Amnesty laws in Argentina at the time shielded him from prosecution. I signed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/19/argentina.theeditorpressreview\">the extradition papers</a>. </p> <p>Since then, many inroads have been made to ensure that the world's most serious crimes no longer go unpunished. The international criminal court is up and running, and 107 states, including Mexico, have ratified the treaty establishing the court and acceded to its jurisdiction. </p> <p>National courts, such as those in Spain, play an increasingly strong role in combating impunity through the exercise of universal jurisdiction. The rise of these types of prosecutions has in turn motivated countries, including Argentina and Chile, to repeal their amnesty laws so that suspected war criminals can be prosecuted at home. The trials of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/europe/2001/yugoslavia_after_milosevic/\">Slobodan Milosevic</a> and <a href=\"http://charlestaylortrial.org/\">Charles Taylor</a> have demonstrated that even heads of state are no longer safe from prosecution. The comfort level for perpetrators of these crimes is shrinking as the options for prosecution expand. </p> <p>Whether the progress in this battle against impunity continues or slides backwards is now in the hands of the United Nations security council. On July 14, the ICC prosecutor, Argentine lawyer Luis Moreno-Ocampo, announced that he was seeking an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for orchestrating the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/sudan.warcrimes\">atrocities in Darfur</a>. Immediately after the announcement, Sudan's government and its allies began a diplomatic campaign aimed at securing a security council deferral of the investigations for 12 months. They are attracting wider support than they should \u2013 in part because of fear of retaliation against UN peacekeepers and humanitarian workers. </p> <p>But the security council must be extremely cautious in considering any suspension of ICC proceedings. Such a decision would be a serious setback to the movement to end impunity for the most serious crimes. It would show that indicted warlords and dictators can avoid justice by holding the security council hostage to threats of more violence. </p> <p>Suspending the ICC's work in this way would undermine its potential for deterrence, one of the purposes for which it was established. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/14/sudan.humanrights\">Postponing the case</a> against al-Bashir would seriously undercut the important principle \u2013 which has gradually been taking root worldwide \u2013 that no one is above the law. </p> <p>The security council's decision to refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC prosecutor in March 2005 was itself a major milestone in the battle against impunity. That decision demonstrated, for the first time, that there was an institution that could investigate and prosecute the most serious international crimes regardless of where they occur. </p> <p>Apart from being a victory for international justice, the referral was also a promise to victims of the horrific crimes in Darfur that the perpetrators of the crimes against them would one day be held accountable. For the security council to step back from that commitment would do more than abandon the victims in Darfur. It would be a major blow to those around the world who have struggled to put an end to impunity for perpetrators of humanity's most terrible crimes. </p> <p><em>Jorge G Casta\u00f1eda, former foreign minister of Mexico (2000-2003), is a global distinguished professor of politics and Latin American studies at New York University</em></p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",

  "<p>It used to be said in Las Vegas that there were only two groups that the could get 500 Latinos in a room: The Catholic Church and the Culinary Union, says Hugh Jackson, the blogger behind the <a href=\"http://www.lasvegasgleaner.com/\">Las Vegas Gleaner</a>. Long before the Democratic Party realised that Latinos would be a force in politics, the Culinary Union was aggressively organising the community.</p> <p>Latinos make up 25% of the population of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, but they usually only vote by about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-nevada-polls\">half of the numbers in which they are eligible</a>, Hugh said. Will the efforts of the Culinary Union and the Obama campaign actually get Latinos out to vote?</p> <p>Some say that if Latinos, who traditionally lean strongly Democratic, would have turned out in 2000 that Nevada would have gone to Al Gore, sending him to the White House, Hugh said.</p> <p>\"Everyone wonders if this will be the year that Latinos show up,\" he said.</p> <p>The Culinary Union isn't leaving that to chance. The union had to work hard to unite its 100,000 members after the state's causcus. Ignoring the union's endorsement, many of its members rebelled and supported Hillary Clinton. She narrowly won the state.</p> <p>In the lead up to the general election, the union has workers <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/oct/09/close-ranks-around-obama-unions-hit-streets/\">six days a week canvassing to get voters out</a>.

John McCain has been an advocate for immigration reform, an unpopular position within his own party, but something that is important to a senator from a border state. He hasn't said much about immigration reform, which might be a mistake as we found in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/13/uselections2008-barackobama1\">speaking with Latino students in California</a>. He <a href=\"http://washingtonindependent.com/7855/mccain-courts-latino-vote\">revisited this issue in September</a> as Obama increased his lead amongst Latino voters, but has said little since. </p> <p>McCain <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14444.html\">can't win for losing</a>. His reform efforts are largely forgotten in among Latinos, and he's being punished for the \"other Republicans' <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/20/nation/na-martinez20\">hostility to illegal immigration</a>\". </p> <p>Immigration isn't on most people's radar this election. The economy is the issue by overwhelming margins. Hugh said that he has yet to see a single political ad on immigration this year.</p>",
  "<p>The eurozone has stood up. One is entitled to adapt a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong#Leadership_of_China\">quotation of Chairman Mao</a> on this occasion, since last weekend has seen the People's Republic of China playing a major role in the ongoing bail-out of the American investment banking industry. But even more significant was that it has also seen the clearest demonstration by the states participating in the European single currency that their response to the current crisis will be to deepen yet further their economic coordination and integration.</p> <p>The line has been drawn under last week's unfortunate \"go it alone\" initiatives started by Ireland and given weight by Germany. In the new committee of the president of the European Union, the president of the commission, the chairman of the eurozone and the governor of the European Central Bank, we have the start of an institutional framework for the political governance of the eurozone. In the structures to guarantee inter\u2013bank lending, although the funding remains at national level, we have the first steps towards true transnational burden sharing. In the announcement of the taxpayers funds to support banks in difficulties, we have the beginnings of a common fiscal regime. When all this is taken together with the European Central Bank's capacity to cut interest rates, which is now far greater than that of either the Federal Reserve or of the Bank of England, we have the makings of a fundamental shift in the economic leadership of the west from America to Europe.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, the UK Treasury deserves considerable credit for having established the policy principles for dealing with this crisis, which have now been adopted by the governments of the eurozone. But then, it had to. Britain's banking system, because it has mirrored more closely American rather than continental European practice, has faced far deeper problems than the financial institutions of the eurozone, with the possible exception of those of Ireland. The continental European perception, which has so outraged British Eurosceptics, that this crisis has been fundamentally made in America, and constitutes the comprehensive defeat of the highly leveraged Anglo-Saxon banking model, remains entirely valid. </p> <p>Central to the Eurosceptics' criticism has been their claim, as argued by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/europe-eu\">Simon Tilford and Philip Whyte</a> in the Guardian, that the widening of the spreads between, for example, the yield on German and Greek government bonds, suggests that the euro is about to fall apart under the pressure of profound intra-member state macroeconomic imbalances. This is based on the assumption that Portugal, Italy, Greece or Spain, the much derided \"Pigs\", would be far better off with their own currency, which they could devalue in order to restore external competitiveness. But if anything has been demonstrated by the recent market turmoil, it is the paramount importance of credit-worthiness. The yield spreads on government borrowing of countries which cannot print their way out of their obligations to their creditors, is the surest guarantee that ultimately fiscal disciplines will prevail.</p> <p>No such certainty is available for those whom the British government will be wishing to entice into gilts in order to fund a banking bail-out, which, in terms of percentage GDP, far exceeds anything being undertaken in the eurozone, including Ireland. Moreover, we are already seeing the impact of sterling's devaluation against the dollar on our import prices. Once global price stability is restored, the inflation restraint upon the UK economy is likely, once again, to become acute, since the rise of Asia is now structurally inflationary. If, on the other hand, we face a prolonged global recession, substantial enough to blunt these price pressures, fiscal contraction will make the burden of funding government debt intolerable. The eurozone allows its members, even its weakest ones, to substantially evade this most painful dilemma. </p> <p>It would be difficult to imagine a more favourable environment, both from the point of view of high and low politics, in which to relaunch the campaign for Britain's full commitment to the European Union, including joining the single currency. The high politics are that the west must now find much greater unity of purpose if it is to preserve its values in the face of what has been a massive loss of leadership and power to Asia and, in particular, to China.</p> <p>A powerful, united and prosperous Europe is now the key to the continuing strength of western values. One that will be able to forge a partnership of equals across the Atlantic and rally into its sphere of influence the remainder of the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and north Africa. But such a grand and generous ambition will only be possible if Britain is fully engaged in the European project. No European country has a greater understanding of the Atlantic dimension of European civilisation. No European country is more experienced in a global role. It is no exaggeration to say that if Britain becomes committed to the promotion of genuine international democracy which the European model represents, then it will still be possible to be optimistic about the eventual triumph of liberalism and individualism. </p> <p>Then there are the low politics, which have already been signalled, almost too perfectly, by the return of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4878623.ece\">Peter Mandelson</a> to the cabinet. The chancellor's statement in the House of Commons yesterday, in which he vindicated Gordon Brown's almost honorary membership of the Councils of the eurozone, and his assessment that the weekend's events had reinforced the importance of Britain's membership of the European Union, are the first expressions of a new strategy. Europe is once again becoming the Conservative party's Achilles heel.</p> <p>With a prospective Obama presidency abandoning the notion that Britain should choose America rather than Europe, the proposition which was the neocon lifeblood of Tory Euroscepticism, with the British public generally blaming America for the coming recession and with the whole ideological climate having shifted sharply from right to left, Cameron faces an impossible task. No amount of abandoning not just his tie, but also his business suit and sounding like a Marxist in relation to City bonuses can draw the poison against Europe, which now infects every level of his party. The more Gordon Brown plays the European card over the coming months, the more certain he can be of transforming the turnaround of the past fortnight into a platform for another election victory, or at the very least, a hung parliament. Europe should be the new axis which would make an eventual cooperation with the Liberal Democrats possible, perhaps at last, even to the extent of a new progressive coalition.</p> <p>Of course, there are still severe challenges ahead. Brown remains a deeply compromised figure as a credible pro-European and he cannot escape the blame for a severe recession, which is now unavoidable. There is also the nagging concern that the possibility of <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/node/14204\">Scottish independence</a> will undermine our image amongst global investors of absolute constitutional stability and thus threaten our capacity to fund the bail-out of our financial system and counter the cyclical deterioration of our public finances.</p> <p>It could also undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland, a prospect rendered more dangerous by the deep dysfunction of politics in the Republic, as expressed by the no vote on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/13/ireland\">Lisbon treaty</a>. This puts into even sharper relief Cameron and Hague's determination to oppose its ratification to the limit. There is also the marked trend in today's Conservative party, as it is forced away from its traditional pro-American stance, to anchor its continued hostility to Europe in a narrow English nationalism; one which the pressures of recession could drive towards extremist attitudes on issues such as immigration and welfare.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a closer commitment to Europe could sustain the union and the peace settlement in Ulster and create a framework for a new economic policy, including eventual membership of the euro that would offer the best prospect of an early recovery in growth. In any event, Europe, the great sleeping issue of British politics, which has destroyed, in one way or another, every government since Suez, is once more at the centre of our political debate.</p>",
  "<p>History seems to show that big crashes teach big lessons \u2013 and many of the new rules born out of panic and chaos remain both in law and common sense. So the humbling of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10880718\">Wall Street</a> and the City of London has ended the idea that the market rules and financial capital is king. </p> <p>Instead the state has returned with a vengeance \u2013 nationalising and regulating its way back into the public's mind. Government is back in the US, Japan and the European Union and is busy attempting to stave off \"a meltdown\". Meanwhile the world is kept afloat by China and India.</p> <p>Neither Asian giant will be untouched by the crisis \u2013 and growth will slow in both countries. The <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/index.php\">International Monetary Fund</a> sees China growing at 9.3% this year, down from 11.9% last year. India will manage 7.%, off from 9.3%.</p> <p>Economic developments have political consequences. But they are not the ones you might expect. The question here is not about growth but about the model of government \u2013 what works best after the crash?</p> <p>India's government would like to take the credit for running the world's second fastest growing major economy over the last five years. It would also like electors to believe it had nothing to do with the \u00a3500bn that has evaporated from the country's stock markets since January.</p> <p>The fact is none of this is relevant to Indian democracy. Most governments in India are thrown out of office because voters do not believe they have done anything that deserves keeping them in.</p> <p>Paradoxically the lack of democracy in China has meant that performance is a necessity. Beijing's Communist party has to deliver public goods such as education and electricity to remain in power.</p> <p>India's democrats stay in office because the public had to vote for someone. When the polls arrive, 80% of the time Indian politicians are booted out. Little wonder communists in Beijing think elections are bourgeois diversions.</p> <p>India has built its economy without the tools of an autocratic state. The country has a legal opposition and channels for protest. But it has not had a revolutionary break with the past. There is no need for the elite to overthrow the Indian state because they benefit hugely from it. After all, why would they get rid of a social structure that maintains their privileges?</p> <p>Indian democracy appears a squabble for spoils rather than an urge to improve. What the west cannot see is that India's democracy is largely built around competition by different groups, who vie to control parts of the economy. They have a shared interest in making the economy grow but only to seize a larger chunk for themselves.</p> <p>That's why caste remains such a big issue \u2013 especially when government jobs and university places can be got on the basis of your ancestor's alleged persecution. India is also a rural, unindustrialised giant, so issues of class are a much smaller factor than in the west.</p> <p>This is kind of talk does not sit well with the western narrative that the development of individual reason led to capitalism and more individualistic societies. That's because it's wrong. The west got rich first and then got democratic. It was not a pretty process.</p> <p>Because the poor did not have rights, the transformation from agriculture to industry was a violent one. In England, peasants in the 18th century were simply thrown off the land. Parliamentary acts, pushed through by a landed upper class, cut down the amount of common pastureland. The result was to create a rootless labour force that fuelled the industrial revolution. China's modern-day version is just on a bigger, perhaps bloodier, scale.</p> <p>If India is to take advantage of its newfound economic might and create an industrial base for deploying mass production and employing its teeming millions, then it will need to reconcile politics with history. If India cannot industrialise, it will never be rich. But Indian democracy has shied away from the conflict that development brings \u2013 preferring talking to doing.</p> <p>Although no one wants violence, Indian democracy is failing to deliver the step change it needs and instead is planting the seeds of its own demise. The fate of the world's cheapest production car \u2013 the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Nano\">Tata Nano</a> \u2013 is symbolic of problems inaction will bring.</p> <p>The administration of West Bengal could not manage to negotiate with a few thousands farmers for a 1,000 acre plot of land to build a factory for the Nano. Instead the car plant will now be in <a href=\"http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=336735\">Gujarat</a> \u2013 boosting the profile of Narendra Modi, the rightwing Hindu leader of the state whose administration has been accused of orchestrating mobs to kill Muslims in 2002.</p> <p>Modi is a populist leader with a demagogic style. He is revered and feared. The US has twice refused him a visa on state department advice. Yet in taking up the Tata project he is seen as a man who gets things done when others cannot. Modi is a religious conservative who promises a reactionary revolution from above.</p> <p>Modi is also a clever politician, building a nationwide reputation as an economic reformer who has cracked down on corruption. He appears to recognise that the globe is at a turning point and portrays himself as seeking office by accident, swept into power by circumstance. If that were to happen India would regret it. So would the rest of the world.</p>",

  "<p>A proposal for a giant global fund to pay the owners of the world's forests not to cut them down has received a guarded welcome from environmental groups. They warn of the risks of giving rich nations a cheaper alternative to cutting their own greenhouse gas emissions and to the human rights of the tens of millions of people who live in or who depend on forests for their livelihoods. </p> <p>The independent report, revealed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/greenpolitics-climatechange\">the Guardian</a>, was written for the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and states that an international carbon market could prevent the deforestation that is a major contributor to climate change and inject much needed funds into poor countries.</p> <p>The report calls for an international agreement to halve the carbon dioxide released through deforestation by 2020. It acknowledges this will be costly but estimates such action could be worth $3.7tr (\u00a32.1tr) to the world's nations in net benefits over the long term. If nothing is done to slow rampant deforestation, the report states, the resulting climate change will cause impacts costing governments nearly $1tr a year by 2100. </p> <p>The report was written by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Eliasch\">Johan Eliasch</a>, a businessman appointed by Brown to be his special adviser on forests. Deforestation is responsible for at least 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing it is seen as one of the quickest and cheapest ways of cutting emissions. </p> <p>The report recommends that forests be included in the emerging global carbon market. By giving standing trees a carbon value, it says, \"the cost of halving global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 50% in 2030\". </p> <p>The Eliasch review acknowledges it could take at least five years before the global carbon market is operating and that not all countries would currently agree to such a system. </p> <p>It notes that countries that would benefit from international payments to protect their forests should be required to comply with international agreements that require them to respect human rights and to protect the environment. </p> <p>The countries that might benefit are some of the most politically volatile, and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 corrupt in the world. It says that in the short term the international community should pay up to $4bn to 40 forest countries to help them reach acceptable standards of governance. </p> <p>Environmentalists welcomed the report as a sign of deforestation being taken seriously by governments, and agree the issue must be tackled, but urge caution over how it is done. \"Sufficient and long-term funding is needed to act as an incentive to protect forests,\" said Emily Brickell, climate and forests officer for <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\">WWF-UK</a>. </p> <p>But protecting the needs of people was also paramount, she said: \"More than one billion of the world's poorest people rely on forests for their livelihoods, so any measures to reduce emissions from deforestation must ensure that local communities enjoy continued access to, and benefits from, forest resources.\"</p> <p>Andy Tait, Greenpeace's head of biodiversity, expressed concern over the effect the plan would have on emissions in rich nations. \"If Gordon Brown accepts these proposals he will give a green light to companies to use forest protection abroad as a cheap alternative to making the dramatic cuts in the industrial and energy sectors that we need here in the UK. Allowing forests to become a get-out-of-jail-free card for the big polluters would be extremely bad news in the fight against climate change.\"</p> <p>The reliability of the carbon market is also a key factor, said Simon Counsell, director of the <a href=\"http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/\">Rainforest Foundation UK</a>: \"There is a serious danger of placing excessive hope in what might be very unreliable and speculative forest protection carbon credits. </p> <p>\"Avoided deforestation carbon credits might well turn out to be sub-prime, as weak tropical country governments fail to deliver actual reductions in deforestation, or as forests increasingly become susceptible to fire and disease because of the warming effects of climate change itself. Trading off our own emissions against hoped-for reductions in deforestation could be a catastrophic lose-lose strategy.\" </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>'s international climate campaigner Tom Picken, the plan does not address the deeper causes of deforestation: \"Financial packages are needed \u2013 but we must also address the underlying causes, such as biofuels, excessive meat consumption and industrial logging.\"</p> <p>Under the proposed scheme countries would be rewarded with carbon credits, which could be exchanged for cash on the global market, for not cutting down forests and for reforesting previously logged areas. While the international community would monitor forest loss via satellite, it would be left to national governments to decide how money earned would be distributed and what measures would be needed to prevent illegal logging. </p> <p>The review says countries could tackle deforestation in different ways. The most controversial would be to pay logging companies not to fell trees, or subsistence farmers not to clear land. In addition, countries could greatly increase their policing of forests or could tax heavily anyone who clears forest.</p> <p>But it accepts that halting deforestation will be difficult. \"Such delegation [of responsibility] will involve significant costs ... which may be very challenging for many forest nations in the short term. Demonstration activities to test these approaches will be needed.\" It accepts there are significant human rights and land-ownership risks.</p> <p>\"Risks include increased state and outside expert control over forests, support for anti-people conservation and land speculation\", says the report.</p>",

By this morning, the Marek fire was 70% contained.</p> <p>One man interviewed on the local NBC affiliate said that he had been prepared to evacuate. \"We live in southern California,\" he said, speaking through a smoke mask. \"Fire, flood, drought, earthquake - those are the four seasons, right?\"</p> <p>The two fatalities came on Monday.

The winds spread acrid smoke through the area and hindered authorities' ability to use fixed-wing aircraft to drop fire retardant. </p> <p>However the winds did not reach the heights feared Monday night, peaking at 60mph, and allaying concerns that the fires could reach the coast.

  "<p>There was, lest you missed it, a rather important basketball game in London last weekend. A cracking tie that went to the final seconds before being resolved. Two teams going full tilt with a frenetic comeback from the favourites that almost came off, offering value for money for everyone in the house.</p> <p>Unfortunately only a few hundred people turned up at the City Academy in Willesden to see <a href=\"http://www.bbl.org.uk/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&amp;id=949\">London Capital sneak past Guildford Heat in the British League</a>, a stark contrast from the 18,000 or so who, the next day, gathered only 12 miles away to watch the New Jersey Nets face the Miami Heat in a tight, but ultimately, meaningless NBA exhibition. And therein lies the timeless contradiction that the sport in the UK must confront.</p> <p>Travelling to the 02 Arena on what passes for a Sunday service on the London Underground, it wasn't hard to spot an NBA fan. There were plenty of Dwyane Wade replica Heat jerseys, more than a few Celtics and Lakers tops, and \u2013 on an optimistic note \u2013 a decent sprinkling of Chicago Bulls apparel bearing the name of Britain's very own Luol Deng.</p> <p>Not once, though, did I spot anyone wearing a single item of clothing proclaiming their bonds with their local team. The odd Great Britain vest, sure. But the NBA, as befits the world's best league, is king. How, realistically, can its domestic distant cousin ever hope to compete for a share of the spoils, particularly if \u2013 as Commissioner David Stern confirmed \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/oct/13/ussport\">London is to be the site of regular season contests</a> in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics?</p> <p>Stern has promised to lend his brand \u2013 and his people - to help ignite a more widespread interest in the sport in the UK. \"We're looking to make a human and financial investment over the long-term, not just once a year,\" his chief European chief emissary Sophie Goldschmidt told me. \"We want to build from the ground upwards, which means more initiatives in the future, more TV coverage and bringing our top stars over.\"</p> <p>All help gratefully received, some might say. But part of British basketball's image problem has always been an unfair comparison with the NBA. Stood side by side, the indigenous product comes off second-best. And while Stern might be sniffing the possibility of long-term financial rewards, there is a real danger that his efforts, however well-intentioned, might suck vital life out of what is already here.</p> <p>The NBA as competition, rather than partner? Even the chief of the Euroleague and long-time Stern ally, Jordi Bertomeu, <a href=\"http://www.euroleague.net/item/36129\">conceded last week that both were rivals</a> \"in the sponsorship market and in the search for economic resources in general\".</p> <p>Should you not tread lightly to avoid trampling toes, I asked Stern? \"We've been in business now in Europe for two decades. Actually more. I accompanied the New Jersey Nets to Italy in 1984. The first McDonald's [Championship] was played in Madrid in 1988,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I would say to those who are currently involved that they should be working with us. We have partnered in these games with the Euroleague. Three Euroleague teams are coming to the USA to play five games in this exhibitions season. And we need to work together to grow the sport and if us being here on a regular basis means that happens, I think we would be welcomed.\"</p> <p>Stern, history has shown, is usually proven right. However, as many are reserving judgement as rushing in. Speaking to a number of figures in British basketball in recent days, there is a widespread consensus that talk is cheap but real impact will require real money. And I understand it, a recent proposal put to the Football Foundation, which would have seen basketball coaching being offered to kids along side soccer, was placed on ice because the NBA baulked at providing the necessary financial support.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is up to the indigenous authorities, teams and contributors to help themselves. Achievement by Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics would provide the biggest fillip of all but even that is already in danger. The original bid included a promise that the London Games would leave behind a home, of sorts, for basketball. Instead Boris Johnson's re-think has seen the idea mooted to host all bar the semis and final <a href=\"http://www.basketball247.co.uk/news/archives/00000207.shtml\">in a temporary building shipped in from Switzerland </a>or, shockingly, at the past-its-sell-by-date Wembley Arena. Stern, creditably, joined the condemnation of that idea. \"We want the sport to be showcased well,\" he said.</p> <p>Perhaps next time the NBA stages a game in London, he could invite the Capital to come along and provide the warm-up? Then as many as possible could see not just the best of the best for one night only, but also what is on offer, on their doorstep, all year round, once the circus rolls out of town.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Brighton. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Mike Lord (keyboards, vocals), Paul Steel (bass, vocals), Sandy Buglass (guitar, vocals), Stuart Provan (drums). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Stars and Sons is/are the brainchild of Brighton boy wonder Mike Lord, who has given up promising careers as, variously, a refuse disposal coordinator (OK, binman), telesales drone and ice-cream vendor in an Essex zoo to make lush pop music on a budget in his bedroom. He named his group \u2013 featuring, on bass/vocals, early New Band of the Day maverick and fellow Brian Wilson nut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/04/popandrock1\">Paul Steel</a> \u2013 after a song by latterday baroque popsters Broken Social Scene. Not surprisingly, Stars and Sons sound a bit like that Canadian collective, with their chaotic swirl of influences that includes everything from the dream-pop of My Bloody Valentine to the piano-pop of Ben Folds Five and the Technicolor extravaganzas of Flaming Lips, only, of course, without the major label backing. <br> After the recent commercial failure of Jack McManus and Julian Velard we're less than confident that this brand of Andrew Lloyd Webber-goes-pop has any appeal in the wider world. But we're not going to assess its chances of achieving success; instead we're going to applaud Lord's ambition. We're not market analysts, we're pop fans. It's Good for Me has some of the camp grandeur of Mika, who now that we think about it didn't do too badly, thank you very much, with this sort of rocked-up music for musicals. He even refers to \"my loyal subjects\" at one point with the haughty glee of Freddie Mercury before describing himself, unless we're hearing things, as \"Julian Cope on caffeine\". When he starts warbling in his distinctive falsetto about levitating cars and medicating his troubles and strife on the busy, bustling low-rent Queen-rock of Future Proof \u2013 you can just imagine the glockenspiels, tubular bells, trumpets and choirs \u2013 we start to cheer. And that's without mentioning the hand-painted sleeve that debut single In the Ocean arrives in \u2013 all splotchy and blotchy, 500 of them were hand-finished using kids' poster paints, and if you sniff it, your whole childhood will come flooding back in a Proustian rush. Or not. The band appear to have got high on the paint fumes, because accompanying the single is a trippy but actually mightily impressive DIY promo, filmed using Lord's dad's video camera. A veritable Michel Gondry-on-a-shoestring freak-fest, it includes an underwater dance scene with a girl wearing a Scarlett Johansson mask and climaxes with Lord being tossed from a wardrobe into the sea. Lucky he was just inhaling paint.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Camper than a row of tents at a gay holiday village where the redcoats wear pink coats.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> We thought Mika's success would have opened the door for legions of glam-popsters, but sadly not, which doesn't augur well for the enterprising Lord. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Attract a small number of loyal subjects. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Dance underwater with Scarlett Johansson. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> In the Ocean is released by Alcopop on November 17. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Ben Folds, Eels, Flaming Lips, Queen. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/starsandsonsuk\">www.myspace.com/starsandsonsuk</a>. <br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Women.</p>",

  "<p>I still have never gotten over the impulse to over eat when I am on holiday. This past August my husband Damian had been hired to DJ a party in Florence so I decided to tag along. Stretching it into a week for some relaxation and gastronomy, we booked a room in a 14th -century agriturismo. In the heart of Chianti, we were living the Tuscan dream thanks to the recommendation of an American friend who has lived there for twenty years. Lori is a writer. Her latest book; a collaboration with her husband Jason Lowe, Beaneaters and Bread Soup is a collection of stories, portraits and recipes from the very region in which Damian was spinning records. <br><br>One morning after four cappuccinos and two ice-creams, there was still no way we could ignore the smell billowing out of a little bakery in the town of San Casciano. Inside, the locals knew exactly what they were getting, and they liked to get it quickly. There is no tolerance for loitering. So when it was suddenly my turn, I nervously nodded, \"si, si\" to the healthy looking woman behind the counter wielding the huge knife. The parcel she pushed into my hand was still warm and slightly sticky where the juices could not be contained. We paid and once out on the street, we ripped open the paper and devoured its contents. A soft, foccaccia-like bread dotted with wine grapes and rosemary. That evening, we were invited to the home of a dear friend of Jason and Lori's for a pizza-oven party. On the way through the winding valleys, Lori insisted we stop off for an aperitivo. The unassuming shop sold everything from sacks of flour to Campari on the rocks. Under a glass case on the counter, was the remaining slice of another one of these grape breads. Schiacciata, Lori informed me, is a product of the crush. This version was made with fennel seeds rather than rosemary, and was even better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338580574\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/14/1223984710590/icecream.jpg\" alt=\"cake mix\" width=\"345\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carefully add the eggs to the cake mixture</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Ptak/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, in October, it is the time of the uva fragola, or the strawberry grape. If you have never tried one, I implore you to do so. They are the flavor of childhood grape bubblegum. There is a grape in California called the concord grape, which is what purple grape juice is made from. It has a very similar pungency and is irresistible. The fragola grapes are not the easiest variety to find here in London, but they turn up at Borough Market and other small delis. Their one drawback is that nestled in the silky flesh is a seed the size of a birdshot.</p> <p>I use them to make an icing for my cupcakes at Broadway Market but I wanted to try to use them in some way to evoke the wonderful flavour of the schiacciata I decided to make an upside-down cake with them despite the little problem of the seeds. I pounded some fennel in the mortar and sprinkled that into the cake mixture. This is a wonderful cake even if it looks slightly menacing with its deep purple colour. The one good thing about the seeds I decided, is that it slows you down so that you don't eat the whole cake at once.</p> <p>Fragola Grape Upside-Down Cake</p> <p>For the caramel:<br>100 g unsalted butter<br>150 g light brown sugar</p> <p>400 g fragola grapes, washed and pulled from their stems</p> <p>For the cake:<br>125 g very soft unsalted butter<br>180 g caster sugar<br>2 eggs<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>1 teaspoon salt<br>1/2 cup buttermilk (or whole milk if you have that to hand)<br>1 1/2 cups plain flour (typt \"00\" if possible)<br>2 teaspoon baking powder<br>2 teaspoons fennel seeds, crushed in a mortar </p> <p> <br>First make the caramel. Put the butter and brown sugar in the bottom of an 8\" cake tin and place the tin directly on the flame of your stovetop/hob. Stir constantly until the butter-sugar mixture comes together and bubbles. Set this aside to cool.</p> <p>For the cake, cream the butter and caster sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and mix until incorporated. Add the vanilla and salt. Add half of the buttermilk and mix. Then, having sifted together the flour, baking powder and fennel, add half of that to the mixture. Add the remaining milk and finally the remaining flour. </p> <p>Now that the caramel has cooled, cover it with the washed grapes. Over that, pour the cake batter and smooth the surface. </p> <p>Bake in a 170\u00b0C/375\u00b0F oven for about 40 minutes. The top should spring back when baked. Let the cake sit for about 15 minutes before running a knife around the edge and inverting it onto a serving plate. If it is too hot, it can fall apart. Wonderful for breakfast as well.</p> <p>\u00b7 This blogpost was amended on Wednesday October 15 2008. In the recipe above we should have written vanilla extract not essence.

  "<p>He's already been banned from China after his film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/71555/seven.years.in.tibet\">Seven Years in Tibet</a> upset the communist authorities. Pretty soon it's likely Jean-Jacques Annaud won't be too popular in certain parts of the subcontinent: the Oscar-winning French director's next project looks likely to be the terrorism thriller Kashmir, set in the disputed region on the border of India and Pakistan.</p> <p>In the story, which has been penned by DB Weiss, three ex-mercenaries head for the region after hearing that a terrorist leader with a $30m price on his head is going to be in town for a while. But it turns out that each of them has another reason for being in the area, and tensions mount as they near their objective.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117993921.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">Variety reports</a> that Annaud is in final negotiations to direct, and, as is his wont, has made up his mind to shoot as close to the area he is depicting on film as possible. However, given the politically tense nature of Kashmir, location scouts are also looking at sites in Argentina, Mexico and other parts of India. You know, just in case.</p> <p>Annaud's first feature film, Black and White in Color, was awarded the best foreign language Oscar in 1976, but he is perhaps best known for 1997's critical flop Seven Years in Tibet which managed to cause a certain amount of controversy. Two years after the film's release Annaud confirmed that, while most of the film was shot in Argentina, two crews had secretly shot footage in Tibet. The Chinese authorities banned Annaud and stars <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/bradpitt\">Brad Pitt</a> and David Thewlis from ever entering the country due to positive depictions of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dalailama\">Dalai Lama</a> in the film.</p> <p>Pitt's portrayal of the Austrian mountaineer and one-time SS Nazi Heinrich Harrer was also the subject of a certain amount of attention: he came third in a BBC poll of the all-time worst movie accents.</p>",
  "<p>In theory I should now be dead. Not from disease or an accident but because of the simple fact that my head was set to be severed from my body with a sharp sword in a public square in Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital. </p> <p>In 2001, I was condemned to die in this brutal archaic fashion after being caught up in what became known as the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/09/saudiarabia.paulkelso2\">Saudi Brits</a>\" affair. Along with eight others, I was rounded up by the panicked Saudi authorities after a series of attacks on foreigners in the kingdom suddenly started to make this expat country of choice seem distinctly unsafe. </p> <p>Desperate to pin a nascent anti-government insurgency on squabbling \"bootlegger\" foreigners (anything rather than concede that ultra-safe Saudi Arabia had an internal terrorism problem), we were to be the sacrificial lambs. Remember those bizarre, wooden \"confessions\", haltingly delivered by scared looking men on national Saudi television? One of those came from me. If I looked petrified it may have been because I'd been dragged to prison, threatened, sleep-deprived and beaten so severely that I almost died from heart attacks. </p> <p>In a numbed state of shock, I would have confessed to anything. As it was, I said I'd committed a series of laughably implausible \"turf war\" crimes that never even existed. The farce continued. I was subjected to two perfunctory, completely scripted trials at which I was told to plead guilty and beg for mercy. I was sentenced to death, tried again twice without even being in the courtroom at all, and again sentenced to death by beheading. </p> <p>This, remember, is what happened just a handful of years ago in a justice system of an influential Middle Eastern country that enjoys excellent diplomatic relations with most of the world's powerful countries, including Britain. It was only this time last year, for example, that we were rolling out the red carpet for King Abdullah's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/oct/30/thestatevisitofkingabdull\">state visit</a>. </p> <p>So, how did I come to be alive to write this for the Guardian today? Simple. Belonging to a wealthy \"client\" nation like the United Kingdom means that while you can be tortured and falsely imprisoned in Saudi Arabia, in practice you are not going to suffer a brutal demise in \"chop chop\" square in this execution-addicted country. </p> <p>At the time of my ordeal there was much talk of \"diplomatic efforts\" to secure our release. This was mostly UK government spin \u2013 they had to put it about that they were trying hard to get us out. Yes, they will have exerted pressure on the Riyadh authorities but I later learnt that I and my fellow detainees had been released as part of a \"prisoner exchange\" involving five Saudis being held by the US at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. </p> <p>Finally released in August 2003, after 964 days of solitary confinement, torture and dehumanising terror, I harbour no illusions about what saved me: my passport. There was no apology, no official pardon, just a perfunctory granting of \"clemency\" and immediate expulsion from the country. An accident of birth had preserved me and eventually my release became a political expediency. </p> <p>Ironically, even the manner of my release further confirmed the politically corrupt nature of the Saudi system of justice. Foreign workers like me, subject to bogus trials and languishing in miserable jails, can only hope that the Saudi lottery of false mercy will save them. Meanwhile, of course, Saudi's poor migrant workers from Somalia, Bangladesh, the Philippines or Pakistan are virtually doomed if they face a capital charge (not all for lethal crimes, incidentally). </p> <p>Anyone who might somehow think that Saudi justice is harsh but fair should read a new <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_18728.pdf\">Amnesty International report</a> (pdf) which shows that the legal system is heavily rigged, with well-connected Saudi nationals up to eight times more likely to negotiate \"blood money\" pay-offs to victims' families that lead to commutation. </p> <p>Certainly one shouldn't forget that ordinary Saudis without the right connections are also going to their deaths in this lethal lottery of a justice system. The latest figures show that this blood-soaked country is on average executing at least two people every single week. </p> <p>In my experience what passes for a judicial system in Saudi Arabia has less to do with investigating crime and punishing criminals, and far more to do with maintaining control and compliance among both its own citizens and its community of ex-patriot workers. </p> <p>Why should we care? Well, apart from the fact that thousands of British people go to work in this country every year and that Britain continues to maintain extremely cordial relations with the Saudi royals, this wretched system is simply an affront, not only to justice but to our common humanity. </p> <p>If ever there was an advertisement for the abolition of the death penalty and for all that is wrong with its application, Saudi (in)justice provides it. </p> <p>I can only ask: when are western governments going to stop pandering to the Saudi princes? Or could it be that they prefer to go on burying their heads in the sand?</p>",

  "<p><strong>October 13 session</strong></p> <p><strong>42 day pre-charge detention</strong><br>Plans to increase pre-charge terror detention from 28 to 42 days will be dropped from the counter-terrorism bill after a crushing Lords defeat, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, announced. </p> <p>She said the measure will instead be the subject of a separate piece of legislation to be brought before parliament if required.</p> <p>Flanked by the prime minister, she said in an emergency statement: \"Some may take the security of Britain lightly - I don't.\" The counter-terrorism temporary provisions bill stood ready to be introduced \"if and when the need arises\".</p> <p>Earlier the Lords rejected government's plans for a 42-day limit by 309 votes to 118. Lord Dear, former chief inspector of constabulary, moved the amendment to bar any extension beyond 28 days. He said: \"This attempt to appear tough on terrorism, I believe, is a shabby charade which is unworthy of a democratic process and we should reject it.\"</p> <p><strong>Cash injection for banks</strong><br>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, defended the dramatic cash injection for the banks as a \"significant step\" to restoring confidence in the system. He said the measures were \"essential to stabilise the financial system and help the UK economy\".</p> <p>Darling stressed the need for governments to work together to counter the crisis, insisting it was increasingly clear the package formed \"the basis of an international consensus on the right response to these events\". </p> <p>MPs cheered disclosure that there would be no bonuses this year for board members of banks seeking multi billion pound cash injections - HBOS, Lloyds TSB and RBS.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, agreed the bank rescue was the \"only option\" available to the country but warned taxpayers were in no mood to celebrate the \"painful end to the age of irresponsibility\".</p> <p><strong>Landsbanki</strong><br>The Bank of England is providing a loan of \u00a3100m to Icelandic bank Landsbanki to help maximise payouts to UK creditors, Darling announced today.</p> <p><strong>Peter Mandleson</strong><br>The business secretary, Peter Mandelson, took his Lords seat as Baron Mandelson of Foy in the county of Herefordshire and Hartlepool in the county of Durham. He will be known simply as Lord Mandelson. Wearing the traditional ermine-lined scarlet robes, he swore allegiance to the Queen in a short ceremony.</p> <p><strong>Missing data</strong><br>A computer hard drive reported missing last week by an IT firm contracted to the defence ministry may have contained personal information on 1.7 million people, armed forces minister Bob Ainsworth disclosed. He said information on the disk, which went missing at the EDS site in Hook, Hampshire, was \"unlikely\" to have been encrypted.</p> <p>Ainsworth said the disk drive had been used with the military training administration and financial management information system (Tafmis) and \"may, in the worst case, contain details relating to 1.7 million individuals who have enquired about joining the armed forces\".</p> <p><strong>Tony Blair</strong><br>Speaker Michael Martin pledged to look into reports that former prime minister Tony Blair \"deliberately misled\" parliament. Tories John Maples and Peter Luff said documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that in 1997 Blair personally intervened to secure Formula One's exemption from a tobacco advertising ban just hours after meeting the sport's boss, Bernie Ecclestone.</p> <p>Martin asked the two MPs to write to him so that his officials could look into the matter. He said: \"I am deeply concerned that two honourable members have said they were deliberately misled. And albeit that the person concerned is out of the house, I am deeply concerned about that matter.\"</p> <p><strong>New academy schools</strong><br>The schools secretary, Ed Balls, announced plans for three more schools to be transformed into academies. They are Unity College, Northamptonshire - to be sponsored by the Church of England diocese, Rossmore School, Poole - to be sponsored by the local diocese and Bournemouth University and St Lukes, Portsmouth - to be sponsored by the charity ARK, supported by the Church of England diocese.</p> <p><strong>Lord Adonis</strong><br>Balls said he tried to persuade Lord Adonis, architect of the government's education reforms, to stay in his department. He added that Lord Adonis moved to the transport department because he \"wanted a new challenge\". His comments came as Tory Graham Stuart (Beverley and Holderness) said: \"You may have been envious of the success and the cross-party support enjoyed by the architect of the academies programme, Lord Adonis. But was that really reason enough to force him out?\"</p> <p><strong>Human rights</strong><br>Reforms of major international organisations are needed to promote and maintain democracy and human rights throughout the world, Europe minister Caroline Flint said. The UK will work to make changes to the UN and the European court of human rights as part of its dedication to democratic values, she told MPs.</p> <p><strong>Gurkhas</strong><br>A Bill that would allow more Gurkhas to remain in the UK after they are discharged from the British army cleared the Lords, watched from the public gallery by actress Joanna Lumley. Last month a high court judge ruled the government's immigration policy that excludes some Gurkhas was unlawful and in need of urgent review.</p> <p>Lord Brett, for the government, said: \"In light of the ruling of the court, urgent action is being taken to publish new guidance and to review all cases outstanding by the end of the year.\"</p> <p><strong>First world war veterans</strong><br>The surviving first world war veterans have been invited to take part in a ceremony to mark the 90th anniversary of the signing of the armistice, veterans minister Kevan Jones announced. It was hoped the veterans would lay a wreath during a service on November 11, exactly 90 years after the guns fell silent in the trenches.</p> <p><strong>Sexually transmitted infections</strong><br>A sexual \"free for all\" among young people is leading to serious public health problems, Tory former minister Robert Key (Salisbury) warned. He said young adults were engaging in alcohol-fuelled sex, leading to increasing levels of sexually transmitted infections. Children's minister Beverley Hughes said: \"I certainly agree that for a minority of young people this is a problem and I think we have got to take it seriously and we are doing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Have you noticed how environmental campaigners almost inevitably say that not only is global warming happening and bad, but also that what we are seeing is even worse than expected? </p> <p>This is odd, because any reasonable understanding of how science proceeds would expect that, as we refine our knowledge, we find that things are sometimes worse and sometimes better than we expected, and that the most likely distribution would be about 50-50. Environmental campaigners, however, almost invariably see it as 100-0. </p> <p>If we are regularly being surprised in just one direction, if our models get blindsided by an ever-worsening reality, that does not bode well for our scientific approach. Indeed, one can argue that if the models constantly get something wrong, it is probably because the models are wrong. And if we cannot trust our models, we cannot know what policy action to take if we want to make a difference. </p> <p>Yet, if new facts constantly show us that the consequences of climate change are getting worse and worse, high-minded arguments about the scientific method might not carry much weight. Certainly, this seems to be the prevailing bet in the spin on global warming. It is, again, worse than we thought, and, despite our failing models, we will gamble on knowing just what to do: cut CO2 emissions dramatically. </p> <p>But it is simply not correct that climate data are systematically worse than expected; in many respects, they are spot on, or even better than expected. That we hear otherwise is an indication of the media's addiction to worst-case stories, but that makes a poor foundation for smart policies. </p> <p>The most obvious point about global warming is that the planet is heating up. It has warmed about 1C (1.8F) over the past century, and is predicted by the United Nations' climate panel (IPCC) to warm between 1.6-3.8C (2.9-6.8F) during this century, mainly owing to increased CO2. An average of all 38 available standard runs from the IPCC shows that models expect a temperature increase in this decade of about 0.2C. </p> <p>But this is not at all what we have seen. And this is true for all surface temperature measures, and even more so for both satellite measures. Temperatures in this decade have not been worse than expected; in fact, they have not even been increasing. They have actually decreased by between 0.01 and 0.1C per decade. On the most important indicator of global warming, temperature development, we ought to hear that the data are actually much better than expected.</p> <p>Likewise, and arguably much more importantly, the heat content of the world's oceans has been dropping for the past four years where we have measurements. Whereas energy in terms of temperature can disappear relatively easily from the light atmosphere, it is unclear where the heat from global warming should have gone \u2013 and certainly this is again much better than expected. </p> <p>We hear constantly about how the Arctic sea ice is disappearing faster than expected, and this is true. But most serious scientists also allow that global warming is only part of the explanation. Another part is that the so-called <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticmet/patterns/arctic_oscillation.html\">Arctic oscillation</a> of wind patterns over the Arctic Ocean is now in a state that it does not allow build-up of old ice, but immediately flushes most ice into the North Atlantic. </p> <p>More importantly, we rarely hear that the Antarctic sea ice is not only not declining, but is above average for the past year. IPCC models would expect declining sea ice in both hemispheres but, whereas the Arctic is doing worse than expected, Antarctica is doing better. </p> <p>Ironically, the Associated Press, along with many other news outlets, told us in 2007 that the \"<a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/11/america/Arctic-Melt.php\">Arctic is screaming</a>,\" and that the Northwest Passage was open \"for the first time in recorded history.\" Yet the BBC reported in 2000 that the fabled Northwest Passage was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/918448.stm\">already without ice</a>. </p> <p>We are constantly inundated with stories of how sea levels will rise, and how one study after another finds that it will be much worse than what the IPCC predicts. But most models find results within the IPCC range of a sea-level increase of 18-59cm (7-23in) this century. This is of course why the thousands of IPCC scientists projected that range. Yet studies claiming one metre or more obviously make for better headlines. </p> <p>Since 1992, we have had satellites measuring the rise in global sea levels, and they have shown a stable increase of 3.2mm per year (1/8 of an inch) \u2013 spot on compared to the IPCC projection. Moreover, over the last two years, sea levels have not increased at all \u2013 actually, they show a slight drop. Should we not be told that this is much better than expected? </p> <p>Hurricanes were the stock image of <a href=\"http://www.climatecrisis.net/\">Al Gore's famous film</a> on climate change, and certainly the United States was battered in 2004 and 2005, leading to wild claims of ever stronger and costlier storms in the future. But in the two years since, the costs have been well below average, virtually disappearing in 2006. That is definitely better than expected. </p> <p>Gore quoted MIT hurricane researcher <a href=\"http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/home.html\">Kerry Emmanuel</a> to support an alleged scientific consensus that global warming is making hurricanes much more damaging. But Emmanuel has now published a new study showing that even in a dramatically warming world, hurricane frequency and intensity may not substantially rise during the next two centuries. That conclusion did not get much exposure in the media. </p> <p>Of course, not all things are less bad than we thought. But one-sided exaggeration is not the way forward. We urgently need balance if we are to make sensible choices. </p> <p><em>Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2008. <br><a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">www.project-syndicate.org</a></em></p> <p><em>Due to an editing error in this article the extent of the decrease in global temperature was given as between 0.01C and 0.1C per year, rather than per decade.

  "<p>This piece, by the way, is not about judicious critical sifting \u2013 it is simply a reader's reaction to gulping down the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booker-prize\">Booker </a> shortlist \u2013 which I have done in preparation for reporting (fairly and without prejudice, of course) the result tonight.</p> <p>I began with Steve Toltz, whose debut <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/370\">The Fraction of the Whole</a> struck me as fresh, vivid, funny, breezy and original until about halfway through. Then, for me, it rather ran out of steam.</p> <p>Much had been made by the judges, or at least by their chairman Michael Portillo at the shortlist briefing, of the breathtaking modernity of the other first novel on the lineup: <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/358\">Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger</a>. True, it investigates the dizzying world of Indian entrepreneurs with an almost Dickension sense of the way the worlds of the rich and the intolerably poor connect and collide. For me, though, this interesting material wasn't quite enough to catapult it into the realms of a really first-rate novel.</p> <p>Linda Grant's <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/364\">The Clothes On Their Backs</a> \u2013 about the London child of Hungarian immigrant parents who discovers her oddly glamorous uncle and a hidden family history \u2013 was readable. But not, in the end, a contender, I felt.</p> <p>Sebastian Barry's <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/360\">The Secret Scripture</a> is simply beautifully written, and you really want to get to the bottom of the lives of his two narrators \u2013 one an old woman who has lived most of her life in a lunatic asylum, the other her psychiatrist. But oh! it's depressing. Yes, if last year's winner, Anne Enright's The Gathering, was accused of being a work of Irish miserabilism, then her book has nothing on this. Grinding poverty, prejudice, fear, violence, misogyny, perverted religion: all are here. In a funny way (perhaps because of the Enright) I think it's unlikely to win, though who knows? It's the favourite.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/363\">Amitav Ghosh's Sea of Poppies</a> is a virtuoso number: a wonderful multilayered novel about a group of disparate characters in 1830s India whose lives knit together as they come together to take to sea on the ship Ibis. The poppies of the title are opium poppies \u2013 the coming opium wars between Britain and China form the backdrop to this story, the first in a trilogy. One the real joys of this book is the language \u2013 Ghosh mingles English, American, Indian, Anglo-Indian and Lascar dialects with wonderful abandon. It's very rich. The smart money, they say, is on this book.</p> <p>In the end, my book - the one to which I've really bounded back with joy when I've had a train journey, or at bedtime, or at any other time really - is Philip Hensher's <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/360\">The Northern Clemency</a>. Much, I must say, against my expectations. I wasn't looking forward to getting through his doorstop (a fear that turns out to be stuff and nonsense - just a couple of weekend's reading). But his saga of rather ordinary Sheffield families from the 1970s is strangely compelling. His characters are wonderfully drawn. There's an almost Proustian care in detailing (the curious dynamics of a party; the particular atmosphere of a municipal swimming pool). I loved it.</p>",

Millions of new voters have registered this year, many of them from traditionally disenfranchised groups: the poor, the young, and people of color. A majority of these new voters are clearly fall into the Obama camp, so the GOP has mounted a campaign to root out what it claims is widespread voter fraud.</p> <p>They claim that people are registering to vote multiple times, or under false names, or in the wrong jurisdictions, or are not entitled to vote (for example, because they are have no home address or are undocumented immigrants or convicted felons). </p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/opinion/16fri1.html\">New York Times put it in an editorial last year</a>, \"In partisan Republican circles, the pursuit of voter fraud is code for suppressing the votes of minorities and poor people.\" <a href=\"http://projectvote.org/index.php?id=265&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=2601&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=263&amp;cHash=981996ec36\">The myth of voter fraud</a> is a powerful tool to combat the expansion of Obama's voting base. And the tactic is clearly alive and well in Nevada, where the following stories emerged in the past week alone:</p> <p>1) Last Tuesday, members of the new \"Election Integrity Task Force,\" under the leadership of Nevada's Secretary of State Ross Miller (a Democrat, by the way), <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/oct/07/acorn-office-vegas-raided-voter-fraud-probe/\">raided the Las Vegas office of the ACORN</a>, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which has registered thousands of low-income people. They seized eight computers and twenty boxes of documents, citing allegations of fraudulent registrations made by ACORN. \"We've been told that some of the allegedly erroneous applications even included the names of players from the Dallas Cowboys football team,\" Miller said. It's no surprise that ACORN's work is under scrutiny: They have registered more than 100,000 new voters in Nevada alone. </p> <p>2) In Washoe County, so many Democrats have registered to vote that the two party's numbers are now virtually even where Republicans once had a sizable lead. In response, the <a href=\"http://rgj.com/article/20081009/NEWS19/81009043&amp;OAS_sitepage=news.rgj.com/breakingnews\">local Republican Party is disputing</a> what it claims may be fraudulent registrations. In an obvious reference to the ACORN case, country GOP chair Heidi Smith declared last Thursday: \"We're going to request a list of all registered Democrats to check for all the Dallas Cowboys and 49ers and any 'Sherwin Williams' or anything out of the ordinary.\" Smith said she was disputing the registrations after receiving numerous complaints from Republican voters who had received flawed registration cards. The Washoe County Registrar, however, said he had received no reports of voter card errors. </p> <p>For more examples, vote suppression tactics in Nevada are being tracked on some local blogs, including <a href=\"http://desertbeacon.blogspot.com/search/label/Vote%20Suppression\">Desert Beacon</a>, and <a href=\"http://zekesaysso.blogspot.com/\">Zeke Says So</a>.</p>"
