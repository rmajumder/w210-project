  "<p>The life of my father, Geoffrey Holmes, who has died aged 90, was changed by two small newspaper advertisements, the first in the Daily Telegraph, the second in the New Statesman.</p> <p>The first led him to join the metals manufacturing firm London and Scandinavian Metallurgical (LSM) in 1939, a company founded by German Jewish refugees. There he was plunged into an extraordinary world of anti-fascist \u00e9migr\u00e9s, including communists, revolutionaries, pacifists, chemists, artists and musicians in wartime London. His whole working life was spent with LSM, where, through experience and professional diplomas gained at night school, he became chief chemist and an expert in the analysis of the rare metals. </p> <p>The second advert proposed \"English lessons in exchange for German\". This led Geoffrey to Rosl Windler, a Jewish refugee, whom he would later marry. Through Rosl he also met Trude Falk, whom he married after Rosl's death in 1974. He counted himself among the lucky few to have experienced two silver wedding anniversaries. </p> <p>Born in Essex, my father was never able to go to university, because his father died when he was 12. In the late 1930s, he was a member of the pacifist Peace Pledge Union. But meeting Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria changed his view of the war, and he volunteered for the Fleet Air Arm. However, because of the importance of the metals industry, his job was declared a reserved occupation.</p> <p>Later, he lived for 54 years in the house he designed and built in Sheffield, where he participated in a range of cultural and scientific organisations. After he and Trude moved to Lewes, Sussex, in 2005, they took part in the social and intellectual activities that went on there.</p> <p>Geoffrey was a principled man. He was proud to have campaigned in the 1945 general election, and was a supporter of the traditional Labour party. A firm atheist, he believed in the principles of the scientific method. He was also deeply interested in the world around him. His reading included AE Housman, Primo Levi, Trollope, Raymond Chandler and Richard Dawkins - as well as the Guardian. </p> <p>I found myself admiring my father more and more each day as he approached the end. He prepared himself and others with the calm rationality and thoughtfulness that defined him. He is survived by Trude, myself and daughter-in-law Ann, and grandchildren Alex and Tammy.</p>",
  "<p>Here is a nicely photographed, but bland, insipid and weirdly passive-aggressive little film that has been knocking around since 2005, and long been available in the US on DVD. It is set largely in rural Minnesota just after the first world war, when migrant incomers from Scandinavia and Germany, who have arrived to try their luck working the land, face suspicion and out-and-out hostility from the locals on account of the fact that they are still thought of as The Enemy. Elizabeth Reaser is Inge, the beautiful enigmatically smiling German woman who has come over to marry honest, stolid Olaf (Tim Guinee). Bureaucratic niggles mean they can't get a judge to hitch them, so they cause scandal by living together anyway. Alan Cumming plays Frandsen, the quirky guy with loads of kids and no money who befriends them. Reaser's performance is fairly annoying, as she sports her silent, martyred little smile and goes into Jane Campion Piano mode. And the plot does not make satisfactory sense as Olaf makes a grand gesture to help Frandsen out of a financial jam in the final reel - we aren't shown how exactly he thinks his gesture will help, and what precisely is at risk for him personally if it does not work. The \"flashback\" structure moreover fails to add depth. An unusual little picture, but there's not much more to be said for it than that.</p>",
  "<p>A British Airways plane that crashed at Heathrow airport in January was probably brought down by a freak build-up of ice that blocked the fuel supply to its engines, air accident investigators said yesterday.</p> <p>The British Air Accidents Investigation Branch said authorities in Europe and the US should immediately impose interim safety measures on some Boeing 777 aircraft. The crash of flight BA038 was probably caused by a sudden restriction in the aircraft's fuel supply, the AAIB said, following an \"unusual\" combination of factors during the flight from Beijing to Heathrow. The AAIB made three recommendations: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> That Boeing and engine maker Rolls-Royce impose interim measures to reduce the risk of ice forming in aviation fuel in some Boeing 777s;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> That aviation watchdogs in the US and European Union investigate the threat to other makes of aircraft and engines;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> That US and EU authorities review safety requirements for aircraft engines.</p> <p>One expert said aircraft on long-haul journeys may have to fly at lower altitudes until the definitive cause of the crash is discovered. Kieran Daly, group editor of Air Transport Intelligence, said the Boeing 777 would not be the only aircraft affected: \"The AAIB is saying that, for all we know there could be a problem with essentially any long-haul aircraft.\" The AAIB interim report also suggested that the problem could be solved by an anti-icing device used by the military.</p> <p>However, the report stressed the unusual circumstances behind the crash: \"This is the first known occurrence of this nature in any large modern transport aircraft.\" The AAIB said a number of factors probably conspired to bring down BA038 several hundred metres short of Heathrow's south runway at 12.43pm on January 17. Yesterday's interim report said thrust in both the aircraft's engines probably failed because water in the fuel had frozen at altitude, possibly during unusually cold conditions over Siberia, and formed small ice crystals that were released as the plane landed, blocking the fuel supply.</p> <p>The AAIB said: \"This ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel whilst the aircraft operated for a long period, with low fuel flows, in an unusually cold environment.\" </p> <p>Investigators said three unique factors came together in flight BA038 that had not been found in 13,000 other flights: the length of time that fuel temperatures stayed below 0C; low fuel flow demands in cruising flight, and high fuel flow demands during landing. They added that the amount of water in the fuel supply - around five litres - was not abnormal.</p> <p>Boeing said last night that it had devised \"a number of operational changes\" to prevent ice building up in 777 fuel systems that used the type of Rolls Royce engine involved in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said it supported the AAIB recommendations.</p> <p>Flight BA038 struck the grassy approach to Heathrow's south runway, crushing its undercarriage - which became detached - and skidding on its belly for several hundred metres. The engines, wings and tail fin of the aircraft were badly damaged by the impact.</p> <p>The 136 passengers and 16 crew were evacuated on emergency slides. </p> <p>One passenger suffered a broken leg in the crashlanding and eight others had minor injuries. The senior first officer on the flight, John Coward, 41, was hailed as a hero for steering the jet over the airport fence and on to the ground, 300 metres short of the runway.</p>",
  "<p>BP has agreed a peace deal with its Russian partners over the future of their joint venture, TNK-BP.</p> <p>The oil firm announced yesterday that embattled chief executive Robert Dudley will leave TNK-BP by the end of the year, as part of an agreement hammered out with the four Russian billionaires who also own the business. Dudley's departure, along with a boardroom shake-up, is the price of ending one of the most vicious internal feuds in recent corporate history.</p> <p>The deal appeared to have been closely coordinated with the Kremlin. It follows an unprecedented campaign by state agencies against TNK-BP that prompted Dudley to flee Russia, citing harassment. But BP and its Russian partner Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR), who will each continue to own half of the venture, said that the changes were being made for commercial reasons.</p> <p>Under the memorandum of understanding signed yesterday, three new independent directors will be appointed to TNK-BP's board. Instead of five directors appointed by BP and five by AAR, each side will have four representatives. AAR sources said the new structure would guarantee that the incoming chief executive acted in the interests of all shareholders.</p> <p>AAR, a consortium controlled by the four oligarchs, had repeatedly demanded Dudley's removal, claiming he was biased towards BP. Dudley is working from an undisclosed location in central Europe after leaving Russia in July when his visa renewal was refused. In August he was fined 500 roubles (\u00a311) for breaking the country's labour laws as the dispute intensified. Most of the firm's international staff - including 148 seconded from BP - have also left.</p> <p>Dudley's replacement will be nominated by BP but will have to be approved by the whole TNK-BP board. BP said it plans to find a Russian-speaking candidate with extensive Russian business experience. It is understood that the new chief executive must be independent of BP and AAR - which would rule out Viktor Vekselberg, the billionaire oligarch and TNK-BP investor whom AAR has proposed as a new CEO.</p> <p>In coordinated statements, senior Kremlin figures welcomed the settlement. Igor Sechin, Russia's powerful deputy prime minister, said that it was \"a positive signal for the Russian market. We support the development of TNK-BP and believe that this company has excellent long-term prospects.\" </p> <p>Another influential aide to Russia's president Dmitry Medvedev, Arkady Dvorkovich, suggested Russia was open to \"major projects\" with the \"active participation of foreign investors\". </p> <p>The row is widely perceived to have damaged Russia's reputation as an investment destination - a perception compounded by Russia's invasion of Georgia last month.</p> <p>\"TNK-BP is one of the most ambitious and promising projects of this kind. We therefore are pleased that the shareholders resolved their differences through business negotiations, and we are confident this will serve as an important message for foreign companies investing in the Russian economy,\" Dvorkovich said.</p> <p>Under the deal, a 20% stake in TNK-BP could be sold to outside investors at some point in the future through a stockmarket flotation, subject to approval by the Russian government.</p> <p>The Russian oligarchs also welcomed the move. Mikhail Fridman, who had previously accused BP of using \"Goebbels propaganda\" in its battle with AAR, said, \"AAR is very optimistic about the prospects for TNK-BP, both in Russia and internationally. As long-term investors, we are ambitious to see our joint venture with BP achieve great success.\"</p> <p>BP was likewise relieved that the months of warring were over. </p> <p>\"The agreement will create a stable base from which to grow the joint venture to the benefit of everyone involved, including the Russian state, for which strong capital investment and continued technical innovation to boost declining oil output are so important,\" said BP chairman Peter Sutherland.</p>",
  "<p>The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, yesterday issued a direct challenge to Moscow's sway over Georgia, pledging Washington's support for its eventual membership of Nato, while denouncing Russia's \"illegitimate\" invasion. \"Georgia will be in our alliance,\" Cheney said after talks with President Mikheil Saakashvili. </p> <p>Cheney used his one-day visit to Georgia to reinforce battle lines in the increasingly direct struggle between Washington and Moscow for the upper hand along Russia's southern border. His visit to Azerbaijan, Georgia and Ukraine was aimed at stressing America's \"deep, abiding interest\" in the region, in response to the claim by Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev, that Moscow had \"privileged interests\" in former Soviet states.</p> <p>The US challenge was undermined by the collapse of Ukraine's pro-western coalition on the eve of Cheney's arrival in Kiev at the end of his three-country trip yesterday. The crisis threatened to derail President Viktor Yushchenko's efforts to win Ukraine Nato and EU membership.</p> <p>Cheney made clear however that it would not shake Washington's deep involvement in the region, now focused on Georgia after last month's conflict with Russia over South Ossetia. </p> <p>Shrugging off Russian recognition of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, he declared the Bush administration's \"strong commitment to Georgia's territorial integrity\". The US would stand with Georgia, he said, \"as you work to overcome an invasion of your sovereign territory and an illegitimate attempt to change your country's borders by force\".</p> <p>He also made a point of reaffirming US support for Saakashvili, who Moscow has derided as \"a political corpse\". In pointed contrast, Cheney told the Georgian leader: \"You have been fearless in response to the occupation of your country and steadfast in your principles. We respect you.\" </p> <p>The two men made a joint appearance near an aircraft factory destroyed by Russian bombing, to watch a US military transport plane unload blankets, part of the $1bn in emergency aid the US has offered Georgia to help the country rebuild. The package makes Georgia the biggest recipient of US aid after Israel, Egypt and Iraq.</p> <p>US officials stressed the package did not include aid to rebuild Georgia's military. That will be decided later this year.</p> <p>Georgian membership of Nato is due to be discussed at an alliance ministerial meeting in December. Russia insisted yesterday that such a move remained a red line in east-west relations. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's representative to Nato, said Moscow would respond by halting co-operation with Nato over Afghanistan. </p> <p>Cheney's trip coincided with the collapse of Ukraine's government after a split between Yushchenko and the prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko. Their coalition collapsed over Russia's invasion of Georgia - with Tymoshenko positioning herself as a rival candidate to Yushchenko in Ukraine's presidential election next year. Yushchenko has lambasted Russia's occupation of Georgia, while Tymoshenko has refused to criticise the Kremlin directly.</p>",
  "<h2>WHO condemns 'tax on the sick' in poor countries</h2> <p>Impoverished people in the developing world are being taxed for being sick by governments that put duties on medicines, experts at the World Health Organisation said yesterday. A report by the WHO's essential medicines group on access to basic drugs found that people in some countries paid 6.5 times more than the international reference price. What has made medicines unaffordable for the poorest is governments' failure to stock generic copies of drugs out of patent. In the UK 70%-80% of medicines are generics, but in many developing countries the figure is only 10%-20%. <br><strong>Sarah Boseley</strong></p> <h2>Monk smoking out wasps burns down temple</h2> <p>A Japanese monk trying to rid his temple of a hornets' nest panicked when the wasps flew out at him and dropped a flaming stick, burning his temple to the ground, police said yesterday. The Buddhist monk put lighted rags on the stick, prodding it into the nest, but dropped it and ran as the hornets appeared, said Yuichi Ozaka, a Niigata police official. He said Atsushi Sato, 41, had burns on his ears, face and left hand, but had not been stung. The temple in the city of Ojiya, northern Japan, was burned to the ground, along with the nest, Yuichi said. Police said Atsushi's burns were not life threatening. <br><strong>Associated Press in Tokyo </strong></p> <h2>Commuters burn trains in protests over delays</h2> <p>Argentine commuters are so frustrated by delays that some are setting fire to trains. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to quell protests in which passengers burned trains at Merlo and at least one other location near Buenos Aires yesterday. A spokesman for Buenos Aires Trains admitted the company has trouble meeting rush-hour demand for trains running west from the capital, despite a schedule that has trains leaving every eight minutes. Police have not yet reported the number of injured or detained during yesterday's incidents. Similar protests erupted in November 2005. <br><strong>Associated Press in Argentina</strong></p> <h2>Asian elephant is cured of heroin addiction</h2> <p>An elephant that became addicted to heroin at the hands of illegal traders will return to Yunnan wild animal park after a three-year rehab programme, China's state media said yesterday. Xiguang, a four-year-old male Asian elephant, was fed bananas laced with heroin to pacify him after he was captured by smugglers along the China-Burma border in March 2005, the Xinhua news agency said. When he was found months later in China's south-west, he was sent to a protection centre on China's Hainan island. There he received daily methadone injections and is now fully recovered. <br><strong>Associated Press in Beijing</strong></p>",
  "<p>The infant science of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2\">geo-engineering</a> \u2013 one that so many would gladly see strangled in its cradle \u2013 could grow into the best job creation scheme for universities ever invented. Every one of the contributors to the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions special on how to confront global warming with <a href=\"http://publishing.royalsociety.org/index.cfm?page=1570\">gee-whizz technology</a> warns that the engineering is difficult, the outcome unpredictable, the side-effects possibly perilous and the expense prodigious. And that before any of it gets attempted, more research will be necessary.</p> <p>For those who have been asleep in the back of the class: a tiny rehearsal. Geo-engineering is one of the get-out-of-jail-free cards routinely played by the climate change sceptics when it begins to look, even to them, as though global warming might after all be a reality and that profligacy with human resources might \u2013 just might \u2013 have played some marginal role. Well, they say: why give up our cars, our technology, our cheap air travel and our patio heaters? Human ingenuity will surely find a way out of the situation. What's wrong with uncontrolled growth? Surely more wealth means more technological potential, higher population levels mean an even bigger crop of really clever people to find future solutions. And, they point out, so many doomsayers have been wrong in the past, who says the current bunch will be right now?</p> <p>So according to this argument, geo-engineering could be the perfect technological response to a problem fuelled in the first place by profligate technological invention. Why not place a tier of sunshades a million miles from Earth, at a strategic point between the planet and the sun to deflect or absorb a proportion of the solar radiation? Why not erect thousands of vast structures to absorb surplus carbon dioxide and bury it, the way trees soak up the stuff and turn it into wood? Why not darken the clouds with sulphur particles, and recreate the murk of acid rain, but at least stop the poles from melting?</p> <p>Why not cruise across the oceans in robot wind-powered sailing vessels spraying fine particles of brine toward the clouds, to seed condensation and make them whiter and more reflective? Why not dust the oceans with iron filings and trigger carbon-consuming plankton blooms, or achieve the same effect by mixing deep and surface ocean waters, with an array of vast floating funnels? Some or all these things would bring the planetary thermometer tumbling to comfortable levels, and then we could go on as before.</p> <p>And this is the point at which the scientists published by the Royal Society become embarrassed cheerleaders for the technological fix. It would be so much better, they all agree, if the world changed its ways, reduced its dependence on fossil fuels, and tried to live sustainably.</p> <p>But since almost nobody shows any real signs of wishing to adopt the sustainable answer \u2013 and that includes most of the nations that have signed up to the Kyoto protocol, never mind the ones that have no intention of doing so \u2013 then we had better think about some other options now, they argue, because a decade down the line it will be too late. It may seem daft to mitigate the challenge of energy profligacy by expending even more energy, of responding to uncontrolled economic growth by spending even more money on even more ambitious projects, but \u2013 they argue \u2013 tough. What else should we do? Let us at least look at the technological challenges.</p> <p>So in each paper, in the preface and in the critiques, the ideas come with explicit or implied intellectual health warnings. The stratagems may not work at all, or they may work too well and threaten to tip the world into an ice age, or they may seem to work for a while but just trigger some other, unforeseen chain reaction in the great climate machine, and so make things worse, or they may alleviate global warming in one of the few areas of the planet where people would welcome it but make things even worse for rival or partner nations across the sea or on the other side of the mountain range. The ideas might be sound, but the proposed technologies might not be up to the challenge, and require rethinking. The energy costs might be too high (although hardly as high as the cost of doing nothing and letting global warming run away) or the scientific understanding behind the logic of temperature manipulation on a planetary scale might turn out to be incomplete.</p> <p>That's where the academic job creation programme begins. Climate modellers think they understand the climate machine well enough to make a set of predictions about the future. But it is one thing to make detailed predictions about temperatures and sea levels in 2100, after not just you but your grandchildren are dead; quite another to devise a set of actions that could take charge of global thermometer in the next decade, and on your watch. To do that, researchers would have to understand the behaviour of the planet in the finest detail: the role of sea-spray in the condensation of clouds, the intricate pattern of the winds all the way up to the stratosphere and beyond, the chemistry of clouds, the significance of dust storms in the Sahara and central Asia, the enigmatic interplay between ocean temperatures and continental weather systems, the importance of forests and grasslands and the knock-on effects of precise human behaviour. A series of geo-engineering studies would make researchers ask themselves questions, and test hypotheses, and begin to understand the planet in an entirely new way.</p> <p>It would be money well spent. This is the only home we have: the more we appreciate it, the better. It would be money even better spent if \u2013 while university departments were working on space mirrors, chemical sunshades and the greening of the oceans \u2013 governments and peoples took the hint and found effective ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, restore the rainforests and protect the oceans. That way, we'd all win: we'd save the planet and at the same time understand more about the planet we had just saved; we'd save money on fuel and we wouldn't even have to build the expensive planet-saving machinery the research was designed to test.</p> <p>The only flaw is that the British may not have the maths, physics, geochemistry or geophysics or engineering graduates to even begin the job, let alone finish it, but that's a different problem.</p>",
  "<p>Only a week ago few people outside Alaska knew anything at all about Sarah Palin. Seven days on she has become the biggest hot-button political story in the English-speaking world, and her fame is rocketing. Hers is the name in the headline that guarantees a million website hits. But does all that make Palin the defining factor in November's US election? I don't think so.</p> <p>There has been a concerted attempt by the Republican machine in St Paul this week to trash the American media as being too liberal and too establishment to understand the Palin phenomenon. Maybe it is true that the first reflex in some of the political media was to dismiss her as an amateur, a gimmick or just a rightwing crazy. But the media are energised by stories, not ideology. The danger now, after the impact of her speech on Wednesday, is not that the media will underestimate Palin but that it will overestimate her.</p> <p>As Hurricane Sarah blasts through American politics, many lose their bearings and get the whole Palin thing out of proportion. That is nowhere more true than here in St Paul itself. Yes, she lit the touchpaper on a convention that had previously been a damp squib. But the overcompensation is absurd. It sometimes feels as though the selfsame people who at the start of the week were saying that Palin was certain to lose John McCain this election are now saying that she is certain to win it for - and in spite of - him.</p> <p>This is madness, short-termism and loss of judgment. Yesterday, post-Palin but pre-McCain, her convention debut was the only game in town. Did you see her? What did you think? Wasn't it electrifying? Today, post-McCain and pre-whatever the next thing is, Palin is already beginning to slip back into some sort of bigger and more considered context. Give it a week, give it a month, and it will all look rather different again.</p> <p>That doesn't in any way mean that Palin has not made a major impact. She is an exciting rightwing newcomer and modern democratic politics is far more receptive to good women leaders than some critics pretend, as the flawed Palin and the flawed Hillary Clinton have both proved. But this isn't a movie. This isn't Geena Davis in Commander in Chief. It isn't Jane Horrocks in The Amazing Mrs Pritchard. Palin is one important factor among several in this election, and the real challenge, especially here in the eye of the storm, is get her into some perspective.</p> <p>Karl Rove, who is entitled to be listened to with wary respect on such matters, said after her speech that Palin brought three things to the Republican ticket this year. She was, he said, a capable executive, she knew about energy policy, and she could attack with a smile on her face. She made a good populist pitch, he added, but she might have been unwise to keep the Palin family issues in play without absolutely nailing them. It was a pretty sober assessment by an arch-partisan. There was no hint there that this was a transformative candidacy or that the old rules suddenly no longer applied.</p> <p>Indeed, if you probe Rove's three positives, none of them stands up particularly well to scrutiny. Palin may be a competent executive, but two terms as mayor of a town of 10,000 people followed by 18 months as governor of America's third least populated state do not add up to conclusive proof that she is ready to lead the country. She may indeed know about energy policy - it was one of the more substantial parts of her speech - but she is also a driller from a pro-drilling party that is heavily financed by drillers and she said not one word on Wednesday about climate change. Even in gas-guzzling America, that is not self-evidently a populist pitch.</p> <p>Palin can certainly attack. That line about being a pitbull in lipstick was a cracker. You knew instantly where the Sarah Barracuda tag came from. And she proved it in the speech too, with sharp, brutal blows about Barack Obama's years as a community organiser, about his disdain for guns and religion, and about the Styrofoam Greek columns of his Denver acceptance speech. But will either male or female voters want a long-term relationship with a political dominatrix from the Arctic? That's another question.</p> <p>Do not, in any case, exaggerate the importance of the running mate in American presidential elections. Traditionally, the role of the number two on the ticket is to carry their own state, to attack the other party's presidential nominee, and to do well in the televised vice-presidential debate. Palin looks well equipped to do all three. As well as Alaska, she will play well in swing states such as Nevada and New Mexico. But even if she does well against Joe Biden on October 2, how much will it matter? By far the most celebrated knock-out blow in a veep debate in modern times was delivered by Lloyd Bentsen on Dan Quayle in 1988. Yet who ended up in the White House? </p> <p>In the short term, Palin's unquestionable achievement is to have energised a Republican convention and a Republican base that remains uneasy about McCain. Hers was the sort of speech that George Bush, at his best, could do with great effect. Yet it would be a mistake to cast Palin simply as a social conservative from central casting, bent on reviving the culture wars of the 1990s - even though, in some respects, that is the effect of her candidacy.</p> <p>There was a smarter framing of Palin's candidacy in the New York Times this week by the conservative columnist David Brooks. Palin, he suggested, is that rarest of beings - an American politician who sees the world in the same way as McCain sees it. As with McCain, the thing that seems to make Palin get up in the morning is the desire to root out corruption and selfishness. Like him, she is less interested in the left-right or identity prism than in the crusade of virtue against vice. The problem, says Brooks, is that a McCain-Palin administration would be light on pragmatism and deal-making. It could all be a recipe for glorious failure.</p> <p>If that is right, or even half-right, it is a necessary reminder that this election is not about Palin. The contest is between a candidate who wants to break with Bush's policies and one who wants to break with his instincts. It is between Obama and McCain and, though there is still all to play for, it very much remains Obama's to lose.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>They entered the room in single file, hips swaying, lips pouting, eyes shining, to be unveiled and paraded. Six gorgeous women. </p> <p>But the solemnity of the occasion indicated they were more than that. They were a nation's glory.</p> <p>Selection and training was complete and this was the finished product: glossy beauties given the task of maintaining Venezuela's dominance in international beauty pageants.</p> <p>The seriousness of the mission was underlined by the reverential way Venezuela greeted this week's debutantes at a press conference in Caracas. On their slender shoulders rested the country's hopes of retaining the Miss Universe title.</p> <p>\"We have trained them well and trained them to win. We don't want to be runner-up,\" said Osmel Sousa, president of the Miss Venezuela pageant. \"They are disciplined. They are ready.\"</p> <p>The Olympics barely registered here - Venezuela took just one medal, a bronze - but passions are stirring for the coming beauty contests in which the country hopes to prevail.</p> <p>It is an obsession that has won Venezuela more Miss Universe and Miss World titles than any other country and a reputation as a pageant superpower.</p> <p>\"When it comes to this we don't improvise anything. We are organised and dedicated, we don't rest,\" said Carlos Bardasano, vice president of Cisneros Group, the media conglomerate that owns the Miss Venezuela pageant.</p> <p>This week's unveiling, akin to a sheet being whisked off a new formula one car, was a prelude to next week's contest to crown Miss Venezuela, an annual television ratings topper.</p> <p>Elsewhere such contests can run into trouble. Feminist protests forced Miss Sweden to withdrawn from an international pageant in Mexico and riots in Nigeria, where the exhibition of female flesh was deemed offensive, turned into a bloodbath.</p> <p>In Venezuela there is no such risk. Many ordinary Venezuelans, male and female, proudly assert that this is a land blessed with two things: oil and beautiful women. There are thousands of local beauty contests held annually in schools and villages and banks offer loans for nose jobs.</p> <p>President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has railed against widespread cosmetic surgery - girls as young as 15 request breast enlargements as birthday presents - and has tried to steer the country in a more socialist and less materialistic direction.</p> <p>But not even the commandante criticises the pageants. As a young army officer in 1975 he compered a contest and married a blonde model-turned TV presenter. In July he congratulated Dayana Mendoza, who took the Miss Universe crown in Vietnam.</p> <p>Her victory restored Venezuela's fading lustre. After dominating pageants in the 1980s and 1990s the country endured a 12-year title drought. Some attributed it to perceptions that its contestants were more surgically enhanced than others, or unease at Ch\u00e1vez's broadsides against the United States.</p> <p>\"If somebody asks about politics I tell them to change the subject,\" said Sousa, 60, the national pageant president.</p> <p>A dapper dandy who has been dubbed a Henry Higgins, he said the country was on track for more triumphs thanks to natural talent and the academy he runs in Caracas. \"It is a school for beauty. What we do there is make a few changes.\"</p> <p>From a field of some 500 women numbers are whittled down to 70, then 28. Aged from 18 to mid-20s, the successful applicants' key ingredient is height. Anything else, said Sousa, can be added or taken away. </p> <p>The would-be Misses rise at dawn to attend a gym and spend the rest of the day learning to dance, walk in heels and answer rapid-fire questions in 30-second soundbites.</p> <p>\"It's like a military school, it is really tough,\" said Miss Trujillo, one of the six shortlisted hopefuls paraded this week. \"Apart from the exercise there is the diet, chicken and salad, chicken and salad.\"</p> <p>All the women spoke of the discipline in terms of awe. \"I tell you, if our sports learn the same discipline you will be seeing a lot of success in five years time,\" said Veronica Arcay, aka Miss Portugesa.</p>",

  "<h2>Lucy Shuker, 28, tennis player</h2> <p>In just five years, Lucy Shuker has become the British number one women's wheelchair tennis player. \"Of all the girls going to the Olympics, probably none of them has the level of disability that I have. They have a lot more of their body that works.\" So what makes her the number one? \"Sheer determination,\" she says. \"And talent. </p> <p>I love it. I train very hard and I seem to have the ability to do it.\" </p> <p>In 2001, Shuker came off her motorbike. She spent 10 months in hospital. \"The first time I got into a wheelchair, it was just horrendous,\" she says. \"I suddenly realised that this is what my life was going to be like. It was awful. I remember crying for the rest of the day. They weren't sure if I had severed my spinal cord, but the day I got the results of the MRI scan confirming that I had felt like my world just crumbled.\"</p> <p>In hospital, she met Peter Norfolk, the veteran wheelchair tennis champion, who encouraged her to try the sport. She had played badminton all her life, and now tennis became a way of rebuilding her confidence and gave her a focus. \"Without it, I think I would have suffered a lot more. I would have got a lot unhealthier and possibly felt sorry for myself,\" she says. \"I liked that I was doing a sport again. Just because you are disabled, it doesn't mean you can't participate in something. I love the playing, I love the training. And it opens your eyes when you meet people of all disabilities - you see people for who they are, not what they are. My friends and family have been really supportive, but it's probably only been the last two years that I felt I've really found 'me' again. I love my life now. Yes, it's different, and would I change things if I could? Probably. But it's a hypothetical question. It will probably never happen. You have to live with it and accept it and move on. I've dealt with that. It's just a part of my life - it doesn't define me.\" </p> <p>Shuker, who lives in Taunton in Somerset, says she is playing some of the best tennis of her life. \"I have beaten the world number two so, on my day, anything is possible and I have the ability to compete against the top girls. When I first started playing, it was my goal to get to the Paralympics. Then you think, 'I don't just want to get there - I want to win medals.' \"</p> <h2>Darren Harris, 35, judoka</h2> <p>Four years ago, Darren Harris failed to qualify for the Athens games in judo, and decided that wouldn't happen again. \"When I didn't qualify, I gave up my job in computer programming so I could do this full-time,\" he says. \"It's kind of impossible to have a full-time job and get all the training in and take this seriously.\" He now trains every day, sometimes three times a day, and is one of four visually impaired judo athletes who will represent Britain in the Paralympics. </p> <p>Harris started judo 10 years ago. \"I liked the fighting,\" he says with a laugh. \"It's that one-to-one thing, you against an opponent.\" He is too modest to list his achievements, but last year he won a silver medal at the European championships, and followed it with a gold medal at the German Open earlier this year. For several years, he was the captain of the England blind football team, although now he concentrates on judo. </p> <p>Harris developed retina blastoma, a cancer of the eye, when he was two years old; the radiation treatment destroyed the tear duct and scarred the cornea, and his eyesight deteriorated. \"I can see big things, large objects, and some colours, but not any detail,\" he says. What sort of effect has it had on his life? \"It's probably been a blessing, really. When I was younger, I hung around with the wrong sort of people so it got me out of that.\" He insists that he doesn't feel he has missed out on anything. </p> <p>Visually impaired judo means judokas have to have a keen sense of anticipation. \"If you know someone is going to throw their arm over you, then you are kind of prepared for it. I know he will try to do it, I just don't know when - so you have to be alert and react fast enough. If you can see, sometimes your reactions are a little quicker - you know exactly where someone's coming from. I struggle with right-handed people grabbing me from over the top. If I could see that arm coming, I could stop it before he's got that grip. Sometimes it's harder breaking a grip than stopping it in the first place.\" </p> <p>Is he nervous about the games? \"I'm trying not to think about it. I can't worry myself about it. </p> <p>I'm just trying to improve each day, and when I get there, that will be good enough.\"</p> <h2>David Wetherill, 18, table tennis player</h2> <p>This quaint community hall, clapboard painted in ice-cream colours, in a tiny village in Cornwall, is where David Wetherill's table tennis career began when he was 11. \"My dad played here, so that got me into it,\" he says. \"It's so fast and something I can play without too many limitations. I just love it. I get a buzz from table tennis. I used to think my dad was really good and I used to aim to beat him.\" It wasn't long before Wetherill was thrashing him. </p> <p>Now Wetherill, who is ranked number nine in the world, plays against former international players at a larger club in Plymouth and trains for more than 20 hours a week. Table tennis is China's national sport and he knows that it won't be easy to beat the Chinese players. \"You've just got to go and play,\" he says. \"There's no point thinking about the result. It will be nothing like I've ever done before. I used to get nervous, but I don't any more. You can only do your best, can't you? I'm definitely able to win the gold medal.</p> <p>\"There's nobody who I think I can't beat so, psychologically, I think I'm in a good position. The pressure is going to be all on them. I'm not ranked or seeded to win a medal, so there is no pressure on me.\" Whatever happens in Beijing, it is London in 2012 where Wetherill hopes to hit his peak. He is the youngest of the 11 British table tennis players selected for the Paralympics. \"With disabled table tennis it can be a lot more tactical because people have to play on their opponent's disabilities,\" he says. </p> <p>Wetherill was born with a condition called multi-epiphyseal dysplasia, which affects the bones and joints. He had a childhood spent in and out of hospital - one of the reasons, says his mother Liz, why she thinks he has such determination and strength. \"I struggled with my A-levels. I was really stressed out, and they probably suffered because I was training most days,\" he says, though I later find out that by \"suffered\" he means that he wasn't getting the straight As he was used to. \"But this year with the Paralympics was always going to be the important year for me. Table tennis is my life, really.\" </p> <h2>Danny Crates, 35, 800m runner</h2> <p>Everything seems to be conspiring against runner Danny Crates. He has had a year of minor injuries and an ankle injury put him out for several weeks. Still, he is trying to remain positive. \"To have got to 2008, and been the best shape I have ever been in, for it to go all so wrong is hard,\" he says. \"It has been a really upsetting winter, but it wouldn't help me if I got down. You have to have a positive mental attitude and I'm mentally strong and a very determined person.\" Is he worried he might not make it to the start line? \"No, not a chance.\"</p> <p>If Crates's luck changes, and the training goes well, Beijing will be his third Paralympics, and he will be defending the gold medal he won in Athens. He describes that as \"the ultimate moment in my sporting career. It wasn't just the medal - I had 30 of my friends and family out there with me. T hat's what makes it. I won bronze at Sydney and it wasn't enough. For the next four years, I had only one dream and that was to be a champion. I always set my expectations high. Second is nowhere for me. </p> <p>I go out there to win.\"</p> <p>Crates, from Essex, was 21 and working in Australia when a car crash cost him his right arm. \"I came home and the first 18 months were tough, but I compensated for that by enjoying myself. I went out a lot and drank and partied hard. But I picked up my dreams again.\" He had been a promising rugby player, and six months after the accident he was back training on the pitch. \"I had wanted to be a professional rugby player, but didn't have that determination to put in the extra training. But to see that disappear with the crash, you realise what you might have had.\"</p> <p>He was persuaded to give athletics a go in 1997, and started winning international competitions in 1998. He trains twice a day, for 11 months of the year, and supplements his income with after-dinner speaking and motivational courses. \"When I think of Beijing it's upsetting because I haven't prepared like I want to, but as long as I can get out and get running, it will be like this winter never happened. I'm fit and strong and I'll hit the track running. When you start to pick up and it clicks into place, it feels like you're floating above the track.\"</p> <p>Does he feel he has missed out on anything? \"There are obviously frustrating times. My wife and I have a nine-month-old son and that can be tough, knowing I won't be able to be as boisterous with him as other dads. But I wouldn't change it for the world. A few years ago, they did a hand transplant and I think they've since done an arm transplant. It's wonderful, incredible medicine. Would I consider having it done? Not a chance in the world. My life is about being an amputee now and I thoroughly enjoy it. Have you seen how fast the guys with two arms can run? It will ruin my career if you put an arm back on again.\" </p> <p>He laughs. It has changed me. It has made me more focused and determined - my wife would probably argue I'm too focused and determined - but it has given me a drive to achieve.\"</p> <h2>Helene Raynsford, 28, rower</h2> <p>Helene Raynsford doesn't look much like a rower. At Caversham Lakes, the Olympic training facility near Reading, giant men and women mill around. Raynsford is tiny. \"I do get mocked for having really short arms,\" she says, smiling. \"But it's what you do in the boat, isn't it?\" Such understatement: Raynsford holds the world record for arms-only single scull rowing and is tipped to win a gold medal at the Paralympics. Incredible, when you realise she has been rowing for less than three years.</p> <p>Raynsford was 21, in her final year of her medical biochemistry degree, when she suffered a brain injury that devastated her body and has left her without the use of her legs. \"I had to learn pretty much how to do everything again,\" she says. \"It affected my memory, my fine motor skills. I'm really lucky: I made a massive recovery, and a lot of that is down to sport and getting active. If I hadn't, I would still be dependent on people. It took me a while to relearn skills, but I went back to university, I started working, I live on my own.\"</p> <p>Raynsford trained at the Royal Ballet School until she was 17, which may be a hint as to why she is so disciplined. \"You've always got to strive to be the best. This is the same - you have to eat, sleep, breathe it if you want to go all the way. But I despised playing hockey and rounders at school, so I've not always been sporty.\" </p> <p>She had been playing wheelchair basketball, but discovered rowing when, as part of her job for the Department of Health, she went to Dorney Lake at Eton, where the world cup was taking place. \"I didn't know you could row if you were a wheelchair user. I saw a guy in a wheelchair who was wearing a top with 'GB rowing' on it, and I asked him how he rowed. He said 'Why don't you come and have a go?' I started doing it in my downtime of the basketball season. I wasn't interested in competing - I just quite liked the idea of sitting in the boat, watching the ducks.</p> <p>\"In 2006, when I decided to switch to rowing, I wrote my new year's resolutions in my diary - along with stuff like not biting my nails, I wrote that I wanted to go to the world championships.\" She did and won the gold medal for the single-scull arms-only race, setting the world record. \"Life is different now,\" she says, \"if you look at it from going from the Royal Ballet School to being in a wheelchair, but I don't really see it like that. I don't think, 'woe is me'. That's what happened, and let's get on with it.\"</p> <p>Now that razor-sharp focus is on Beijing, after a gruelling year training in all weathers. \"I've had to put my career on hold for a bit. It's fairly full-on. Do you want to go out and party on a Friday night, or do you want to go to the Olympics?\".</p>",
  "<p>Cyprus, that small, beautiful, troubled island beloved of British holidaymakers, is again <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/world/europe/04briefs-TWOSIDESHOPE_BRF.html?ref=europe\">making news</a>. It may, for a change, be good news. The days of division and distrust could finally be coming to an end.</p> <p>The first United Nations sponsored talks for more than four years have just started in a ramshackle building situated in the no man's land between the Turkish north and the Greek south.</p> <p>Most observers feel that it is different this time. The leaders of the two sides, north and south, Greek and Turkish, are genuine in their desire for a settlement to the \"Cyprus problem\". Demetris Christofias, president of the Republic of Cyprus, and Mehmet Ali Talat, the Turkish leader in the north, are in complete <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/cyprus.greece\">agreement</a> about the future, a future they see together, not apart.</p> <p>A sea change has indeed taken place in Cyprus. At the <a href=\"http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3133036,00.html?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf\">presidential elections</a> in the republic held in February this year, the two candidates who gained the most votes, Christofias and his right-wing opponent Ioannis Kassoulides, were both in favour of a settlement. The separatist former president, Tassos Papadopoulos, came a poor third.</p> <p>The same is true in the north; Talat has a strong record of working to reunite Cyprus. Unlike previous attempts to find a solution, Cypriots are this time talking to Cypriots with minimum foreign interference. Importantly, both sides are aiming for the same conclusion.</p> <p>There are of course other players. Aside from the UN, which always sought to be the honest broker in past attempts to bring peace to Cyprus, Turkey is an obvious force to be reckoned with. But now Turkey wants to join the European Union, there is for the first time a key that can open the door to a solution in Cyprus. </p> <p>The democratically elected president of Turkey, together with the prime minister, has made clear the connection between Turkey's European Union prospects and a settlement in Cyprus. Now that the court case brought by Turkey's chief prosecutor against the AKP to which both PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul belong has failed, Turkey is free to pursue its European ambitions. A settlement in Cyprus is a prerequisite for their success.<br> The previous ruler of the northern part of Cyprus (the internationally unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus), Rauf Denktash, was, to all intents and purposes, a puppet of Turkey. He also took it upon himself to derail every attempt to negotiate a solution to the division of the island. He has now gone and Turkey has turned itself around, even apparently reconsidering its need to maintain a large military presence on the north of the island. Likewise the Greeks in the south are more amenable to a settlement that they were even four years ago when they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/24/cyprus.helenasmith\">rejected</a> the plan put forward by the then UN secretary general, Kofi Annan.</p> <p>Other countries with interests in Cyprus are supportive but wisely for the present keeping quiet. It goes without saying the UK is completely behind a solution. The US was very much in favour of achieving a settlement during the previous round of talks and there is no obvious reason why their attitude should have changed.</p> <p>Cyprus is a problem the international community wants to end. Turkey is as signed up for a deal as it has ever been. Despite the opening of several border points, the Cypriot capital Nicosia remains the only divided capital in Europe. There is every chance that this sad and sorry situation may come to an end very soon.</p>",
  "<p>If Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/barackobama.democrats20081\">convention speech</a>, with the white columns in the huge stadium was grand opera, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin's was soap opera</a>. The message was not that we should overlook her inexperience, but rejoice in it. We should vote for her because she was a hockey mom. The content of her speech was dumbed down in a way that was exquisitely handcrafted.</p> <p>In the hall, the audience was festooned with folksy placards handcrafted by the same sophisticated but ultimately stupid whiz-kids who put the <a href=\"http://bastardlogic.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/mission-accomplished.jpg\">Mission Accomplished banner</a> on the USS Lincoln five long years ago. The crowd is different, however. At a Republican convention there is always an undercurrent of bitterness and anger, a readiness to boo at the mention of, for example, community organising, or Senate democratic majority leader Harry Reid, or chant \"<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/03/steele-gives-gop-delegates-new-cheer-drill-baby-drill/?mod=googlenews_wsj\">Drill baby, drill</a>\", as the crowd offers to drive their gas-guzzlers over all obstacles.</p> <p>Of course, the crowd had been primed for bitterness by none other than New York's own Napoleon, the bitter and vicious Rudy Giuliani who always gives the impression of payback time for perennial bullying in his schoolboy days. However, any crowd that cheers Giuliani for celebrating McCain's response to Putin's Cossack raid into Georgia, \"We are all Georgians,\" is not up for cerebration. Whose big talking got the Georgians into that predicament? And is McCain in a refugee camp with Russian tanks stopping him from moving about his own country?</p> <p>Technically, Palin's speech was not a patch on Obama's. I ran it past the reading level test on the spell checker. His had come in at a reading level of fourth grade, with no passives. Hers was a reading level of over ninth grade with six per cent of passives. Strangely, although she was clearly intended to evoke the solidarity votes of small town America, her speech writers, Bush's hand-me-downs, were worried about her pronunciation, and spelt out some difficult words for her on the teleprompter: \"habber-dasher\" for haberdasher, \"new-clear\" for nuclear to avert the Bushian \"noocoolear.\"</p> <p>However, even if the style was higher than Obama's, the content was not. It was aimed at people of faith, who could believe in three impossible things before breakfast. Her speechwriter <a href=\"http://www.matthewscully.com/\">Matthew Scully</a> wrote a book about the ethical treatment of animals, which is perhaps why his residual ethics eschewed any mention of shooting wolves from aircraft that may have sullied the hockey mum image. Nor indeed did he mention that her enthusiasm for hockey led her to <a href=\"http://current.com/items/89268486_as_mayor_hard_core_fiscal_conservative_sarah_palin_left_wasilla_20_million_in_debt\">increase the local sales tax</a> \u2013 including on food \u2013 to build an ice-hockey stadium so that her son could indulge his passion closer to home.</p> <p>The speech was almost certainly inspired by <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken\">HL Mencken</a>'s thought: \"On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron\". But that is unfair. Both she and her speechwriters are very clever, and unscrupulous, and they want to make her fit that role. They are basing their campaign on the premise that the American electorate wants a president on the edge of Alzheimer's and a vice-president who is auditioning for a part in a schmaltzy soap opera.</p> <p>She mentioned, to cheers that her husband was a proud member of the United Steelworkers Union, she glided over pathological Republican attempts to crush unions, and inhibit their organising efforts. But then, nor did she mention her <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1837918,00.html\">run-in with the town librarian</a> (surely along with the little red school house, an American icon) over censorship, her attempts to promote creationism, her belief that God wants federal funding for Alaskan pipelines, her doubts about global warming, or her pursuit of personal family feuds against public employees. This is a serious omission, and almost perplexing since it could prove that she may indeed be a worthy successor to Dick Cheney as a vice-president, and indeed a better shot, hitting wolves rather than colleagues. But then, Cheney wasn't mentioned either.</p> <p>Her balancing budgets may have been helped by a $1,000 per head per annum pork-barrelling operation from federal funds for her small town, helped by <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/stevens/story/499537.html\">Senator Ted Stevens</a>, one of the \"good ol' boys\" she was supposed to have cleaned out, but who is currently campaigning for re-election even as he faces Federal corruption charges.</p> <p>She complained that Obama did not mention victory. But if pressed, she might have to explain why diverting troops from the search for Bin Laden in Afghanistan to Iraq and bogging down in both places occasioned mention for victory. Almost as eloquent in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.georgebush\">deafening sound of silence was any reference to President Bush,</a> which is surely churlish. The USA has had eight years of the policies she was prescribing \u2013 and is teetering on the edge of an economic catastrophe, but she just ignored it.</p> <p>Polls suggest that the American public oppose almost every one of Palin's concealed policies. This speech casts the forthcoming telection as an IQ test for the American electorate. If it fails, I foresee long lines outside Canadian and European consulates as the elite (anyone with an IQ over a 100) tries to get out.</p>",
  "<p>A British Airways plane that crashed at Heathrow airport in January was probably brought down by a freak build-up of ice that blocked the fuel supply to its engines, air accident investigators said today.</p> <p>The British Air Accidents Investigation Branch said authorities in Europe and the US should act immediately and impose interim safety measures on all Boeing 777 aircraft.</p> <p>The dramatic crash of flight BA038 was probably caused by a sudden restriction in the aircraft's fuel supply, the AAIB said today, following an \"unusual\" combination of factors during the flight from Beijing to Heathrow.</p> <p>Today's AAIB interim report makes three recommendations: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> That Boeing and engine maker Rolls-Royce impose interim measures to reduce the risk of ice forming in aviation fuel in some Boeing 777s.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> That aviation watchdogs in the US and European Union investigate the threat to other makes of aircraft and engines.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> And that US and EU authorities review safety requirements for aircraft engines.</p> <p>One expert said aircraft on long-haul journeys may have to fly at lower altitudes until the definitive cause of the crash is discovered. </p> <p>Kieran Daly, group editor of Air Transport Intelligence, said: \"This report indicates that the conventional wisdom in the industry regarding the potential for ice to form in fuel systems on long-haul flights may well be incorrect. There could be circumstances where the aircraft has to fly at a lower altitude.\"</p> <p>He added that the Boeing 777 would not be the only aircraft affected: \"The AAIB is saying that, for all we know there could be a problem with essentially any long-haul aircraft.\" </p> <p>The report also suggested that the problem could be solved by introducing an anti-icing device used by the military which could prevent a similar incident happening again.</p> <p>However, the report stressed the unusual circumstances behind the crash: \"This is the first known occurrence of this nature in any large modern transport aircraft.\" </p> <p>The AAIB said a number of factors probably conspired to bring down BA038 several hundred metres short of Heathrow's south runway at 12.43pm on January 17. </p> <p>In the report, investigators said thrust in both the aircraft's engines probably failed because water in the fuel had frozen at altitude, possibly during unusually cold conditions over Siberia, and formed small ice crystals that were released as the plane landed - blocking fuel supply to the engines.</p> <p>The AAIB said: \"The investigation has shown that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted - most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. This ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel whilst the aircraft operated for a long period, with low fuel flows, in an unusually cold environment.\" </p> <p>Investigators said three unique factors came together in flight BA038 that had not been found in 13,000 other flights: the length of time that fuel temperatures stayed below 0\u00b0C; low fuel flow demands in cruising flight; and high fuel flow demands during landing. They added that the amount of water in the fuel supply - around five litres - was not abnormal.</p> <p>Boeing said it had devised \"a number of operational changes\" to prevent ice building up in 777 fuel systems that used the type of Rolls-Royce engine involved in the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said it supported the AAIB recommendations.</p> <p>Flight BA038 struck the grassy approach to Heathrow's south runway, crushing its undercarriage - which became detached - and skidding on its belly for several hundred metres. The engines, wings and tail fin of the aircraft were badly damaged by the impact.</p> <p>The 136 passengers and 16 crew on board were evacuated from the plane on emergency slides. One passenger suffered a broken leg in the crash-landing and eight others had minor injuries.</p> <p>The senior first officer of the flight, John Coward, 41, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/04/britishairways.theairlineindustry\">hailed as a hero</a> for steering the jet over the airport fence and on to the ground just short of the runway.</p>",
  "<p>It will take some time for the implications of the conflict between Georgia and Russia to be truly understood. Between the unfolding facts on the ground and the flurry of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/russia.georgia\">diplomatic activity</a> in <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/03/europe/EU-EU-Parliament-Georgia.php\">the EU</a> and by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7597336.stm\">the US</a>, there is an impression of developments and change \u2013 but these can only be seen as short term, since the issues at the heart of this situation are far broader than a specific border or state. Indeed, they encompass the very meaning of the international system, and especially the interpretation of international law. Neither an emergency <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL236403420080902\">EU summit</a> nor a visit by US vice-president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/sep/04/georgia.russia\">Dick Cheney</a> to the region will address these, nor will bellicose declarations by Russia. And since the UN is effectively neutralised, due to Russia's refusal to allow a debate on the Georgian conflict, it is unclear when a proper consideration of these core issues can even begin to take place.</p> <p>While any attempt to reduce this debate to simple propositions will do none justice, for the purposes of clarity it is possible to suggest that the western approach holds international law as an absolute arbiter on all issues, both between states and within them. In other words, it is there for state, peoples and individuals alike \u2013 and it tends to attempt to uphold the rights of all three, though in reality it usually comes down firmly on behalf of the state, and so by default sanctifying the integrity of states and international borders, while accepting alterations, such as in the case of Kosovo. Russia, China and other non-democratic regimes see the issue entirely differently. For them international law is solely about the interaction of states: its viability and jurisdiction stops at a state border and national law reigns supreme within any state. The individual, and a people, are therefore beyond the scope of international law within this approach, while territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders are enshrined \u2013 with no exceptions. Within this reading, Kosovo is an unacceptable heresy, to be ruthlessly stamped out.</p> <p>Kosovo keeps coming up because it has become the nub of the Georgian conflict \u2013 which only underlines the need for a far more fundamental debate. And while the west adamantly refutes any comparison between the two, Russia is equally adamant it has served as a precedent for its own actions. Neither side is correct.</p> <p>Within the western perspective, the liberation of Kosovo from Serbia \u2013 starting from a lengthy bombing campaign in 1999, followed by a UN administration of a de facto separate Kosovo, and ending with its self-declared independence \u2013 was a necessity driven by Serbia's systematic abuse of the Albanian majority in Kosovo. As such, it has been defined as a \"unique case\" rather than a precedent in international law, since the circumstances were deemed to be sui generic, not least because the Kosovo issue could be seen as the last unresolved part of the long wars of Yugoslav secession. In truth, this perspective is at best flawed \u2013 there was unfortunately remarkably little that was unique about the circumstances of Kosovo, in which Milosevic let his forces loose upon unprotected civilians: another unchecked despot, whose crimes and misdemeanours were awful but never plumbed the depths of a Mugabe or the Burmese junta, to mention just two of the current cast. What was unique was the guilt of the west over the Yugoslav wars, and especially the Srebrenica massacre \u2013 and the need to assuage it with a large gesture. Moreover, the fact that the west has adamantly refused to act over other despots who decimate their own populations has definitely underlined its belief that Kosovo was unique, and its lack of intention in repeating the move.</p> <p>From the Russian perspective, the 1999 Nato bombing of Kosovo \u2013 and ultimately Serbia \u2013 was unacceptable on two counts: first, it was illegal, since all the action was undertaken without a UN security council resolution. Second, it was a violation of the two issues of international law Russia considers most crucial: absolute acceptance of international borders and territorial integrity; and the inapplicability of international law within a nation state. Within this reading Kosovo was recognised as part of Serbia, and there it had to stay \u2013 while the international community was not at liberty to intervene in the affairs of another state, even if it was persecuting its citizens. To make matters worse, little recognition was given to Russia's crucial role in delivering a halt to the bombing in 1999: working through the OSCE, it was Russia that brought Serbia to the table rather than <a href=\"http://www.kommersant.com/p741721/r_1/US_Kosovo_Frank_Wisner/\">Maarti Ahtisaari</a>, though the west has always given all credit to the latter. And while Russia was party to security council resolution 1244, which gave Kosovo de facto independence under a UN administration, Russia always maintained that it was unacceptable for it to become independent de jure, since this would be a violation of international law. It has therefore refused to recognise an independent Kosovo, and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/67abec7c-6cba-11dd-96dc-0000779fd18c.html\">blocked any attempt</a> to address the matter in the security council over the past <a href=\"http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnN28360832.html\">six months</a>.</p> <p>The Russian invasion of Georgia, and its decision to keep a presence within that state in violation of its signature upon the ceasefire agreement brokered by France, undermines its own argument about respecting territorial integrity and international law. If it had stuck with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are recognised internationally as part of Georgia, it would have been on sticky ground \u2013 but it could still have claimed to have done no more nor less than the west did in Kosovo, including its unilateral recognition of the two regions' independence. It would have been a tenuous proposition, but nonetheless one far more difficult to counter in the west than the one currently maintained by Russia. For by entering Georgia proper, destroying its military infrastructure, and now declaring its democratically elected ruler a \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/world/europe/03russia.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin\">political corpse</a>\" as in one who cannot be dealt with, Russia has basically shown its intentions have little bearing on asserting international law. </p> <p>The west, on the other hand, must stop pretending Kosovo was anything but a dangerous precedent in international law and the viability of the international system. It is. And if it becomes possible to twist out of the current situation due to Russia's excesses \u2013 it will no doubt happen again, somewhere else. Maybe the Kurds, or the Transnistrians, or the Chechens \u2013 the world is full of peoples who want to shake off unacceptable rule and become independent states. Ironically, Georgia, much like many other former Soviet states, was deeply worried about the precedent of Kosovo before it took place, fearing the South Ossetians and the Abkhazians would use it to break away and declare independence \u2013 a move that would have been difficult to counter in the international community. In the event, by Russia taking the step \u2013 or rather several steps too far \u2013 the two regions have lost the opportunity.</p>",

And she is black, one of a tiny number of African Americans at the Republican national convention being held in St Paul this week.</p> <p>A glance around the Republican national convention this week shows a sea of white faces. Only 36 of its delegates are black, less than 2% of the total. At the Democratic convention in Denver last week, 1,087 delegates were black, about a quarter of the total.</p> <p>The Republican party has no African Americans in the US House of Representatives and Senate, while the Democratic party has one African-American US senator -- Barack Obama -- and 42 in the House. The Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies, a research group that studies African-American politics, has identified seven black Republican nominees for federal office this year -- out of more than 460 races -- and said none are likely to win.</p> <p>While the Democratic party last week made history in nominating the first ever black candidate of a major party for president, the Republican party, which in the 19th century freed the slaves and passed measures aimed at welcoming them into American society, remains bereft.</p> <p>Honeycutt, a physician, is running for congress in an overwhelmingly African American district in Georgia. But in her campaign material she hides her party affiliation.</p> <p>\"I don't want to turn them off by saying I'm a Republican right up front,\" she said in an interview in the convention hall. \"I see blacks voting Democrat because their mother did, their father did, their friend says to vote Democrat. And they're not taking the time to do due diligence and see what does the Democrat party stand for, what does the Republican party stand for.\"</p> <p>Indeed, surveys show African Americans tend to be culturally conservative and churchgoing, favour state aid to parents who send their children to private and parochial schools, and are sceptical of the social security programme, a signature issue of the Democrats.</p> <p>In the face of polls showing African Americans vote, Honey and other black Republicans say that the group is a natural constituency for their party.</p> <p>\"Black folks need to know what the policies are, what the planks in the Republican platform are,\" Honeycutt said. \"They need to see that that is exactly how they live, the conservative lives that they live.\"</p> <p>Black Republicans point to the early history of the party. It was founded on opposition to slavery, and President Abraham Lincoln, who led the north to victory in the civil war that ended slavery, was a Republican. The Republican party also led the fight for a series of constitutional amendments granting citizenship to those slaves, while Democrats in the mid 19th century tended to represent racist Southern interests. Martin Luther King was at one point a Republican, and President George Bush appointed two black secretaries of state.</p> <p>But in the last sixty years, the Democrats largely usurped the Republicans as the party of civil rights. In 1948, Democratic president Harry Truman desegregated the US military, and in the 1960s Democrat Lyndon Johnson shepherded through landmark civil rights legislation even as he acknowledged it would cost him support among southern whites. Arican Americans attracted by Johnson's civil rights record then rose within the party and organised the black community for the Democrats.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidates, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, made appeals to southern whites that were deemed racially tinged. Culturally, the Republican party since the 1960's has seen its base move toward the Southeastern United States, home to the old slave states and to segregation, and the western states where few African Americans live.</p> <p>\"The south becomes Republican, giving blacks all the more reason to become Democrat,\" said Don Rose, a veteran of the civil rights era and press spokesman for Martin Luther King's Chicago campaign.</p> <p>In the 21st century, the lingering Republican deficit among African Americans is clear: In 2004, Bush won 11 percent of the black vote, a figure roughly on par with every election since 1964.</p> <p>John McCain has this year made explicit appeals to black political groups, but his home state of Arizona has a tiny black population.</p> <p>\"In addition, Senator McCain does not comfortably weave expressions of faith and religious beliefs into his campaign's narrative - something that many African Americans can relate to, even if they do not support the candidate,\" writes David Bositis of the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies.</p> <p>\"Minorities believe that the GOP is unwelcoming,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia. \"Blacks see the Republican party as the home of almost all those who today oppose or want to slow civil rights enforcement.\"</p> <p>Black Republicans acknowledge they need to improve their outreach without pandering to blacks or adjusting their policies in a way that would drive away white members of their base.</p> <p>To that end, the National Black Republicans Association has posted billboards across the country reminding Americans that Martin Luther King was a Republican. Richard St Paul, a black Republican city councilman in New Rochelle, New York, said the party should recruit more black candidates.</p> <p>And he is unapologetic about his opposition to Obama, who would be the first black president.</p> <p>\"It's fantastic that Obama has reached that plateau,\" St Paul said. \"Nothing says that I have to support a person just because we're the same colour. Martin Luther King said it's not about the colour of the skin but about the content of the character.\"</p> <p>Rufus Montgomery, an African-American Georgia delegate to the national convention, is sceptical the party should change much at all, noting that Republicans have won the White House in seven out of the last 10 elections without substantial support from blacks.</p> <p>He resorted to a metaphor from American football: \"When you're up 42 to 6 at the half, you don't change your strategy.</p> <p>\"The principles and policies of the Republican party: when that appeals to someone they are welcome to join us.\"</p>",

  "<p>A British Airways plane that crashed on the runway at Heathrow airport in January was probably brought down by ice restricting the flow of fuel to the engines, the Air Accidents Investigations Branch has found.</p> <p>It has recommended that airlines introduce interim measures for all Boeing 777 aircraft to reduce the risk of another such accident. The AAIB found that the crash was \"the first known occurrence of this nature in any large modern transport aircraft\".</p> <p>Flight BA038 from Beijing struck the grassy approach to Heathrow's south runway at 12.43pm on January 17, crushing its undercarriage - which became detached - and skidding on its belly for several hundred metres. The engines, wings and tail fin of the aircraft were badly damaged by the impact.</p> <p>The 136 passengers and 16 crew on board were evacuated from the plane on emergency slides. One passenger suffered a broken leg in the crash-landing and eight others had minor injuries.</p> <p>The senior first officer of the flight, John Coward, 41, was hailed as a hero for steering the jet over the airport fence and on to the ground 300 metres short of the runway.</p> <p>Releasing its fifth report on the incident, the AAIB focused on the aircraft's fuel system. It concluded: \"The investigation has shown that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted - most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. </p> <p>\"This ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel whilst the aircraft operated for a long period, with low fuel flows, in an unusually cold environment.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lots of bells and whistles and tout le monde et sa femme foregathered at the National Theatre to hear plans for the Cultural Olympiad this morning. I've done more on this in tomorrow's paper and there's a piece by Natalie Hanman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/04/cultural.olympiad.coe\">here</a>, plus, I've appended some highlights of the programme below. But my overwhelming personal thought today was, Does anyone care? Does anyone seriously remember any element of cultural olympiads past? Will it make the slightest difference to anything at all? </p> <p>As soon as I hear of culture decreed by committee, my heart begins to sink. My instinct is that the great arts organisations of London and UK in general will come up with good stuff for 2012 off their own bats - clearly it is a great moment to be showcasing British culture to the world (and frankly, the gold medal for best artistic nation has already been won, hands down, by us). But a lot of woolly rhetoric about \"celebrating youth, diversity and creating a lasting legacy\" has absolutely damn-all to do with art and reeks of the world of the cultural committee room - that benighted and accursed space. And all these titles that sound like something from north Korea - director of culture, ceremonies and education, kind of thing - well, it brings me out in a rash.</p> <p>Cultural Olympiad: some highlights</p> <p>- Shakespeare Festival: masterminded by the Royal Shakespeare Company and involving major international productions of plays in spring and summer 2012. - Artists Taking the Lead: a series of 12 major artists' commissions to be sprinkled around Great Britain. Artists may submit proposals for works in any genre, from opera to sculpture. - Stories of the World: led by the British Museum, a series of exhibitions across the country will use objects and artefacts to tell the stories of the British people's connections across the world through empire and immigration. - Film Nation: Bringing together great film-makers with young people to unleash the talent of those making films on phones and other new digital technology. There will be a short film competition and an online documentary project with work made by young people. - Festival of Carnivals: street theatre, spectacle, parties and picnics in summer 2012.</p>",
  "<p>Surrey's efforts to sign Shoaib Akhtar for the final three games of their relegation-threatened season have been thwarted because the fast bowler does not have the correct visa. However, the club hopes still hopes the Pakistan international will join when he has obtained the necessary paperwork.</p> <p>\"He is on his way back home,\" said a friend of Shoaib. \"He will soon be going back after fulfilling the necessary visa formalities.\" The setback means Shoaib will only be able to play for Surrey's last two matches of the season, which may prove too late to help the club in their bid to stay in Division One. </p> <p>\"We did everything we could to get him here, but it hasn't worked out,\" said Surrey chief executive Paul Sheldon. \"We thought he'd make an impact as he wanted to get his career up and running again.\"</p> <p>Shoaib was hoping to earn himself a recall to the Pakistan Test side, having not played first class cricket since the end of 2007. In April this year it appeared his career was over after he was banned from cricket for five years by the Pakistan Cricket Board after he publicly criticised the body. That ruling was first suspended to allow him to compete in the IPL, before being reduced to 18 months and then finally overturned.</p> <p>The PCB will also be disappointed by Shoaib's visa problems. Despite previously being reluctant to allow their fast bowlers to play county cricket, the board was keen for Shoaib to regain match fitness.</p>",
  "<p>BP has agreed a peace deal with its Russian partners over the future of their joint venture, TNK-BP.</p> <p>The oil giant announced this morning that the embattled chief executive, Robert Dudley, will leave TNK-BP by the end of the year as part of an agreement hammered out with the four Russian billionaires who also own the business. His departure, along with a boardroom shake-up, is the price of ending one of the most vicious internal feuds in recent corporate history.</p> <p>Today's deal appeared to have been closely coordinated with the Kremlin. It follows an unprecedented campaign by state agencies against TNK-BP, which prompted Dudley to flee Russia in July, citing unprecedented harassment. But BP and its Russian partners Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR), who will continue to each own half of the venture, said the changes were being made for commercial reasons.</p> <p>Under the memorandum of understanding signed today, three new independent directors will be appointed to TNK-BP's board. Instead of the current split of five BP directors and five from AAR, each side will have four representatives each. AAR sources said the new structure would guarantee that the new chief executive acted in the interests of all shareholders.</p> <p>AAR, a consortium of four oligarchs, had repeatedly demanded Dudley's removal and claimed he was biased towards BP. Dudley is currently working from an undisclosed location in central Europe after fleeing Russia in July after his visa renewal was refused and he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/23/bp.russia\">fined 500 roubles (\u00a311) in August for breaking the country's labour laws</a> as the dispute intensified. Most of the firm's international staff - including 148 secondees from BP to TNK-BP - have also left.</p> <p>Dudley's replacement will be nominated by BP but will have to be approved by the whole TNK-BP board. BP said it plans to find a Russian-speaking candidate with extensive Russian business experience. It is understood that the new chief executive must be independent of BP and AAR, which would rule out Viktor Vekselberg - the billionaire oligarch and TNK-BP investor whom AAR proposed as a new chief executive earlier this year.</p> <p>In a coordinated series of statements, senior Kremlin figures welcomed the peace deal. Igor Sechin, Russia's powerful deputy prime minister, said he was \"pleased\" negotiations between AAR and BP had been successful.</p> <p>\"This is a positive signal for the Russian market. We support the development of TNK-BP and believe that this company has excellent long-term prospects,\" Sechin said.</p> <p>Another influential aide to Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev, Arkady Dvorkovich, suggested that Russia was open to \"major projects\" with the \"active participation of foreign investors\". The row is widely perceived to have damaged Russia's reputation as a safe investment destination, a perception compounded by last month's Russian invasion of Georgia.</p> <p>\"TNK-BP is one of the most ambitious and promising projects of this kind. We therefore are pleased that the shareholders resolved their differences through business negotiations, and we are confident this will serve as an important message for foreign companies investing in the Russian economy,\" Dvorkovich said.</p> <p>Under the deal, a 20% stake in TNK-BP could be sold to outside investors sometime in the future through a stockmarket flotation, as long as the Russian government gives its approval.</p> <p>The Russian oligarchs also welcomed the move. Mikhail Fridman, who had previously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/17/bp.oil\">accused BP of using \"Goebbels propaganda\"</a> in its battle with AAR, hailed \"an exciting new chapter in the development of a great company\".</p> <p>\"AAR is very optimistic about the prospects for TNK-BP, both in Russia and internationally. As long-term investors, we are ambitious to see our joint venture with BP achieve great success,\" he said.</p> <p>BP was also relieved that the months of warring were over.</p> <p>\"The agreement will create a stable base from which to grow the joint venture to the benefit of everyone involved, including the Russian state for which strong capital investment and continued technical innovation to boost declining oil output are so important,\" said the chairman, Peter Sutherland.</p> <p>Shares in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bp\">BP</a> rose by 2%, up 10p at 516p.</p> <p>Tony Hayward, BP's chief executive, also paid tribute to Dudley. Calling him \"an absolutely outstanding CEO of great courage and strength of character\", Hayward said Dudley had originally planned to step down at the start of 2008 but had stayed on to help the venture. </p> <p>Most analysts agreed that the damaging battle between AAR and BP was now over. \"I don't think this has been damaging to Russia. It's a business matter. There are some legitimate reasons for AAR to be unhappy,\" said Artyom Konchin of the Aton brokerage in Moscow. He added: \"It's been three or four months.

  "<p><strong>10.45am</strong> A delayed start at The Riverside, and I'm not entirely sure why, <em>writes Richard Rae</em>. Well, the outfield is too wet, according to the umpires, who've scheduled another inspection for 11.15am - but you can't help feeling if the groundstaff had had the blotter working an hour earlier ..... in fairness, I don't know for sure what time they got here this morning, but I'm told operations didn't begin before 8.30am, and if so, it clearly wasn't early enough. It's dry and sunny, but it won't be later today, according to the forecast. Maybe that's the problem - everyone knows there won't be too much play over the next three days, so they're not over-extending themselves for the sake of half an hour this morning. Anyway, an 11.30am start is my optimistic guess.</p> <p><strong>11am</strong> Scarborough - another prompt start here, for which we're all grateful considering the weather all over the country, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>. Sussex are clearly determined to capitalise before the rain reaches this corner of the east coast, and have moved quickly to 226 for four, wicket-keeper Andrew Hodd now within 19 of a second championship century.</p> <p>Yorkshire have opened their attack with Deon Kruis and Adil Rashid, rather than giving the ball straight to Tim Bresnan after his arrival from Cardiff late last night. It's a big day for them off the field as they hope to be given planning permission by Leeds City Council for a new pavilion at Headingley in a meeting this afternoon, while they have also announced ticket prices for next year's Ashes Test. These sound pretty steep, starting at \u00a345 for members and \u00a350 for non-members in the family stand, but not compared to Edgbaston where, according to Yorkshire's chief executive Stewart Regan, the cheapest available seat is \u00a375.</p> <p>Quick update, Hodd has gone, lbw to a ball from Rashid that straightened significantly, leaving Sussex on 227 for five.</p> <p><strong>11.25am</strong> Optimistic was the word. Early lunch (at 12) here at The Riverside, with a view to starting at 12.45pm. It is of course beginning to cloud over. A warm, sunny morning has been entirely wasted. Hey ho.</p> <p><strong>11.40am</strong> You'll never guess what, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at Canterbury</em>. It's been raining. Kent and Surrey will take an early lunch at 12.15pm and hope to start at 12.55pm, but the showers are intermittent and I'm not especially optimistic.</p> <p>Surrey fans, meanwhile, may be interested to know that the club has not given up hope of signing Shoaib Akhtar, despite the visa difficulties that prevented him from entering the country in time for this match. They have three games left, including this one, to avoid relegation (they are currently 18 points adrift of Yorkshire at the bottom of the table and 20 behind seventh-placed Lancashire), and the word is that Surrey are crossing their fingers Shoaib can make it for the crucial home games against Hampshire and Nottinghamshire.</p> <p><strong>12.15pm</strong> Scarborough - that placid start was deceptive, as Hodd's departure triggered a clatter of wickets which saw Sussex all out for 265, and Yorkshire now four for one. But the one isn't Michael Vaughan - he's just allowed the first four balls he faced from Sussex debutant Mohammad Sami to pass outside his off stump. Andrew Gale is the man out, lbw playing all around a full swinging delivery from veteran left-armer Jason Lewry. Good news for the Adil Rashid fan club, as he took three of the last six Sussex wickets to end with four for 56, on the ground where he made such a stunning impact two years ago.</p> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong> Scarborough - Vaughan update. He left a fifth ball, again from Sami, then drove his sixth, a straighter half-volley, handsomely through mid-off for four. But four balls later he should have been out, driving loosely at an outswinger and edging high to third slip's left. But Mike Yardy put him down. Could this be Vaughan's day? Yorkshire now 10 for one, by the way.</p> <p><strong>12.35pm</strong> Graeme Swann joined Nottinghamshire's side a day late for their top-of-the-table championship match against Somerset after the end of England's one-day series, <em>writes David Hopps at Trent Bridge</em>. His chances of getting a bowl this morning did not seem too good when Somerset resumed at 143-7 - but so spirited was their resistance that he had to intervene to prevent a calamitous Notts morning session.</p> <p>Somerset finished on 252, adding another 109 in 26 overs, with Peter Trego supplying a forceful 86 from 108 balls, an innings full of boisterous sallies off the back foot. The Notts seamers, who had been so dominant on the opening day, were brusquely repelled, leaving Swann to join the attack with Somerset 232-8 and Trego 82 not out.</p> <p>Swann did not play a game in England's one-day series - his county teammate Samit Patel was preferred - so he could have been forgiven for feeling a little rusty. But his intervention soon ended Trego's assault as a legside clout was intercepted at deep midwicket by Mark Wagh, a fine running catch. Trego's ninth-wicket stand with Andrew Caddick was worth 90. The match could not be more finely balanced, but it needs to develop quickly today with heavy rain forecast for tomorrow's third day.</p> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong> Bah, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at Canterbury</em>. It's raining once more and we are yet to see a bowl balled. Surrey have now failed to get on the pitch for four-and-a-bit successive days of championship cricket following their washout at Blackpool last week, and a quick glance at the <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/radar/\">Met Office rain radar</a> does not make comforting viewing.</p> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong> Michael Vaughan's Scarborough misery continues as the third innings of his comeback ends in another failure, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>.</p> <p>The former England captain made 19, his highest score since he took a holiday following his emotional resignation, although that was thanks to being dropped by Sussex's Mike Yardy off his 10th ball.</p> <p>There were a couple of elegant off-side boundaries and one good flick off his legs, all off Mohammad Sami, the Pakistan paceman making his debut for Sussex.</p> <p>But after enjoying the unusual sensation of being not out at lunch, he only lasted another four balls after the interval as, facing Sussex's wily left-arm seamer Jason Lewry for the first time, he dealt with three deliveries swinging back into him before following one that was cleverly slanted away, edging a catch to wicket-keeper Andrew Hodd.</p> <p>Vaughan made 10 and 0 in Yorkshire's last championship game against Kent at Scarborough last week, and has now managed only 196 runs from eight championship innings this season at an average of just over 20.</p> <p><strong>1.35pm</strong> Just to rub Vaughan's nose in it, rain has now stopped play, 15 minutes after his dismissal. Yorkshire 35 for two.</p> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> Scarborough - it's stopped raining, the umps have inspected once, but it rained pretty hard, so they're having tea at 2.40pm then looking again at 3pm. The skies look a little ominous.</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong> Play has been called off for the day at Canterbury, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>, which will do little to aid Surrey in their bid to avoid their worst season since 1855. According to a diligent colleague of mine in the press box, that year was the last time Surrey failed to win at least three games in a county season. So far in 2008 their tally of victories is a big fat zero, which means they need to win here, then overcome Hampshire and Nottinghamshire at The Oval to avoid accusations of a 153-year nadir. With more bad weather forecast tomorrow, I suspect their goose is already cooked.</p> <p><strong>3.25pm</strong> Good though it is to be watching any cricket all, the 40 overs played in the afternoon session at The Riverside have not been riveting, <em>writes Richard Rae</em>. The bald figures are that Durham have scored 100-0 in that time (taking their score to 242-3), and are clearly intent on accumulating what bonus points they can before the weather closes in again.</p> <p>Will Smith has gone on to his century, off 217 balls, and Dale Benkenstein to his 50, off 137. Smith has become Durham's top runscorer of the season in the process, though that isn't saying too much (he's now got 744). Lancashire haven't bowled badly, but there has been a wearying sameness about their attack - Cork, Chapple, Smith, Newby and Croft are all much of a muchness in terms of pace. The first over of the innings that wasn't bowled by a seamer was the 68th, when Stuart Law invited Francois Du Plessis to throw up a few leg-spinners. He immediately turned the ball, one a long way, and Law must be regretting his decision not to include Gary Keedy. Though again, given Keedy's record this season, he didn't have that much to lose. Lancs look very flat.</p> <p><strong>4pm</strong> Scarborough - wireless connection has returned to the press box here just in time for the resumption of play, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>. Could be a sticky old session for Yorkshire, given the amount of rain that has fallen.</p> <p><strong>4pm</strong> Just thought I'd add a couple of snippets before signing off, <em>writes Lawrence Booth in Canterbury</em>, where the entire square is covered and the rain continues to fall. It seems that the visa Shoaib Akhtar used to try to get into the country yesterday was the same one that had allowed him a safe passage through customs during his stint with Durham in 2004. Obviously the representatives of Her Majesty at Heathrow, where the Surrey leg-spinner Chris Schofield was sent to collect Shoaib yesterday, have a stricter outlook on life these days.</p> <p>The decision to send Shoaib straight back to Pakistan has left Surrey in an awkward position for a game they must win, since the overseas pro he was going to replace - Australia's Matt Nicholson - had already signed off during Tuesday night's Pro40 defeat against Kent at The Oval. \"He could have played in this match,\" said the Surrey coach Alan Butcher, \"but he's flying home in a few days' time and he probably wouldn't have been in the right frame of mind. There's still an outside chance Shoaib could be available for our last two matches.\"</p> <p>Kent supporters, meanwhile, will be relieved to learn that their South African coach Graham Ford looks like he's staying put rather than taking up the New Zealand job. \"I'm very happy with the set-up here at Kent,\" he told the Kent Messenger. \"I'm working with a fantastic cricket management team and captain and those relationships have developed well and are going nicely. Certainly I have no firm feelings at this point of wanting to head off in any other direction.\"</p> <p><strong>4.45pm</strong> The great thing about all this rain is it gives you an opportunity to get your county records bang up to date, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. And, now that has been attended to, and the coloured pencils have been put back in their box, we even have a little bonus at Trent Bridge: 18 more overs beginning at 5pm. An awful lot will have to happen to get this game back on track. Nottinghamshire resume on 3-0, 249 behind.</p> <p><strong>6.20pm</strong> Notts' experimental opening pair, Will Jefferson and Bilal Shafayat, might have been designed as an optical illusion rather than an answer to their batting problems at the top of the order, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. Jefferson, at nearly 6ft 10ins, is the tallest county cricketer in the land, whereas Shafayat, if he stands on tiptoe, just about musters 5ft 7ins. Stare at them long enough as they stand 22 yards away from each other and eventually you imagine that the Trent Bridge pitch is steeply sloping.</p> <p>They put on 157 against Sussex at Hove last week, but the new alliance might yet fall foul of Health &amp; Safety because if they ever try to punch gloves there is the danger that Shafayat will be left with a bloody nose and Jefferson will collapse to the crease clutching his groin.</p> <p>There were few excuses for glove punching on this occasion. A cautious opening stand ended on 40 - immediately after Somerset got the ball changed - when Jefferson edged Charl Willoughby to the wicketkeeper. Andre Adams was sent in as nightwatchman, but he is not really cut out for such responsibilities and he carved to gully in the same over. Notts completed an awkward 18 overs in milky evening sunshine on 46-2. They trail Somerset by 206.</p> <p>Shafayat was almost dismissed on three when he drove Andrew Caddick to short extra where Max Waller's claim for a catch, supported by his teammates, was not upheld by the umpire Patsy Harris. Both Harris and his fellow official, Tim Robinson, are former Notts players. It says a lot about cricket's deep well of goodwill that nobody is the slightest bit concerned at such things.</p>",
  "<p>Thrillingly, kids, there is news of Kate Middleton, Lost in Showbiz's second favourite indolent arriviste.</p> <p>In recent months - years, maybe? - Prince William's girlfriend has had to endure the barbs of those vulgarians too benighted to understand the demands of being a permanently-auditioning consort. Waspish courtiers have reportedly nicknamed her \"Waity Katie\"; even the Queen was said to have been concerned that the public perceives madam as workshy.</p> <p>And so it is that this week \"close family friends\" have decided they can brook no more, and have taken to the pages of Hello! magazine, where they unleash the most momentous employment news. To wit: Kate already HAS a job. </p> <p>Before we find out what is is, though, they are good enough to remind us why other employment possibilities were discounted. She wanted to work in a gallery, but couldn't, because of \"the galleries' wide, plateglass windows\". She briefly worked in some capacity at Jigsaw's HQ, but as her boss points out: \"she needed an element of flexibility to continue the relationship with an incredibly high-profile man and a life that she can't always anticipate.\"</p> <p>And now? Well, these friends harrumph, Kate \"actually does have a 'proper job' in an office \u2026 She is busy nine-to-five, five days a week\". But where? </p> <p>Why, at her parents' <a href=\"http://www.partypieces.co.uk/\">children's party planning business</a>, of course! </p> <p>Kate \"is helping to put together the all-important <a href=\"http://www.partypieces.co.uk/pages/cataloguerequest/cataloguerequest.asp\">catalogues</a> for the mail order outfit\". Also: she's on a charity committee organising a rollerdisco next month.</p> <p>So there you have it. And whilst it's tempting to see Kate's move into the notoriously competitive helping-your-parents-with-their-brochures field as indicative of a new career ambition so ball-breaking that it could derail her glacial progress toward the status of royal fiancee \u2026 really, nothing could be farther from the truth. You can't fight nature, and no matter how many high-level sections of that 24-page catalogue she arduously approves, nor how many ice sculptures she orders for the rollerdisco, sooner or later her biological sloth is going to start ticking. </p> <p>As Spinal Tap's David St Hubbins once observed, if he weren't in a band, he'd be \"a full-time dreamer\" - so let's accept that the ad-hoc-brochure-assistant game is going to lose one of brightest stars someday soon, and just pray the rollerdisco isn't a casualty too.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337286269\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Mr Chairman, delegates and fellow citizens: I am honoured to be considered for the nomination for vice-president of the United States ...</p> <p>I accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America. </p> <p>I accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election ... against confident opponents ... at a crucial hour for our country. </p> <p>And I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions ... and met far graver challenges ... and knows how tough fights are won - the next president of the United States, John S McCain. </p> <p>It was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves.</p> <p>With their usual certitude, they told us that all was lost - there was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war. </p> <p>But the pollsters and pundits overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off.</p> <p>They overlooked the caliber of the man himself - the determination, resolve and sheer guts of Senator John McCain. The voters knew better. </p> <p>And maybe that's because they realise there is a time for politics and a time for leadership ... a time to campaign and a time to put our country first. </p> <p>Our nominee for president is a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by.</p> <p>He's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years, and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight. </p> <p>And as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief. I'm just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way. </p> <p>Our son Track is 19. </p> <p>And one week from tomorrow - September 11th - he'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country. </p> <p>My nephew Kasey also enlisted, and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf.</p> <p>My family is proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform. Track is the eldest of our five children. </p> <p>In our family, it's two boys and three girls in between - my strong and kind-hearted daughters Bristol, Willow and Piper. </p> <p>And in April, my husband Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical.</p> <p>That's how it is with us. </p> <p>Our family has the same ups and downs as any other ... the same challenges and the same joys. </p> <p>Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge.</p> <p>And children with special needs inspire a special love. </p> <p>To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters.</p> <p>I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House. Todd is a story all by himself. </p> <p>He's a lifelong commercial fisherman ... a production operator in the oil fields of Alaska's north slope ... a proud member of the United Steel Workers' Union ... and world champion snow machine racer. </p> <p>Throw in his Yup'ik Eskimo ancestry, and it all makes for quite a package. </p> <p>We met in high school, and two decades and five children later he's still my guy. My mom and dad both worked at the elementary school in our small town. </p> <p>And among the many things I owe them is one simple lesson: that this is America, and every woman can walk through every door of opportunity. </p> <p>My parents are here tonight, and I am so proud to be the daughter of Chuck and Sally Heath. Long ago, a young farmer and haberdasher from Missouri followed an unlikely path to the vice-presidency. </p> <p>A writer observed: \"We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty, sincerity and dignity.\" I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised Harry Truman.</p> <p>I grew up with those people. </p> <p>They are the ones who do some of the hardest work in America ... who grow our food, run our factories and fight our wars.</p> <p>They love their country, in good times and bad, and they're always proud of America. I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town. </p> <p>I was just your average hockey mom, and signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids' public education better. </p> <p>When I ran for city council, I didn't need focus groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters, and knew their families, too.</p> <p>Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown.</p> <p>And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves. </p> <p>I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a \"community organizer,\" except that you have actual responsibilities. I might add that in small towns, we don't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening, and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren't listening.</p> <p>We tend to prefer candidates who don't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco. </p> <p>As for my running mate, you can be certain that wherever he goes, and whoever is listening, John McCain is the same man. I'm not a member of the permanent political establishment.</p> <p>And I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone. </p> <p>But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion - I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country. Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reasons, and not just to mingle with the right people.</p> <p>Politics isn't just a game of clashing parties and competing interests. </p> <p>The right reason is to challenge the status quo, to serve the common good, and to leave this nation better than we found it.</p> <p>No one expects us to agree on everything.</p> <p>But we are expected to govern with integrity, good will, clear convictions and ... a servant's heart. </p> <p>I pledge to all Americans that I will carry myself in this spirit as vice president of the United States. This was the spirit that brought me to the governor's office, when I took on the old politics as usual in Juneau ... when I stood up to the special interests, the lobbyists, big oil companies, and the good-ol' boys network.</p> <p>Sudden and relentless reform never sits well with entrenched interests and power brokers. That's why true reform is so hard to achieve. </p> <p>But with the support of the citizens of Alaska, we shook things up.</p> <p>And in short order we put the government of our state back on the side of the people.</p> <p>I came to office promising major ethics reform, to end the culture of self-dealing. And today, that ethics reform is the law. </p> <p>While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governor's office that I didn't believe our citizens should have to pay for.</p> <p>That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay. </p> <p>I also drive myself to work.</p> <p>And I thought we could muddle through without the governor's personal chef - although I've got to admit that sometimes my kids sure miss her. I came to office promising to control spending - by request if possible and by veto if necessary. </p> <p>Senator McCain also promises to use the power of veto in defense of the public interest - and as a chief executive, I can assure you it works.</p> <p>Our state budget is under control.</p> <p>We have a surplus.</p> <p>And I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending: nearly half a billion dollars in vetoes. </p> <p>I suspended the state fuel tax, and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress.</p> <p>I told the Congress \"thanks, but no thanks,\" for that bridge to nowhere.</p> <p>If our state wanted a bridge, we'd build it ourselves. When oil and gas prices went up dramatically, and filled up the state treasury, I sent a large share of that revenue back where it belonged - directly to the people of Alaska. </p> <p>And despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists, who kind of liked things the way they were, we broke their monopoly on power and resources.</p> <p>As governor, I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people.</p> <p>I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history. </p> <p>And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly $40bn natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence.</p> <p>That pipeline, when the last section is laid and its valves are opened, will lead America one step farther away from dependence on dangerous foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart. </p> <p>The stakes for our nation could not be higher.</p> <p>When a hurricane strikes in the Gulf of Mexico, this country should not be so dependent on imported oil that we are forced to draw from our strategic petroleum reserve.</p> <p>And families cannot throw away more and more of their paychecks on gas and heating oil. </p> <p>With Russia wanting to control a vital pipeline in the Caucasus, and to divide and intimidate our European allies by using energy as a weapon, we cannot leave ourselves at the mercy of foreign suppliers.</p> <p>To confront the threat that Iran might seek to cut off nearly a fifth of world energy supplies ... or that terrorists might strike again at the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia ... or that Venezuela might shut off its oil deliveries ... we Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas. </p> <p>And take it from a gal who knows the north slope of Alaska: we've got lots of both.</p> <p>Our opponents say, again and again, that drilling will not solve all of America's energy problems - as if we all didn't know that already.</p> <p>But the fact that drilling won't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all. </p> <p>Starting in January, in a McCain-Palin administration, we're going to lay more pipelines build more nuclear plants create jobs with clean coal ... and move forward on solar, wind, geothermal and other alternative sources.</p> <p>We need American energy resources, brought to you by American ingenuity and produced by American workers. I've noticed a pattern with our opponent.</p> <p>Maybe you have, too.</p> <p>We've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers. </p> <p>And there is much to like and admire about our opponent.</p> <p>But listening to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the state senate. </p> <p>This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting, and never use the word \"victory\" except when he's talking about his own campaign. But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed ... when the roar of the crowd fades away ... when the stadium lights go out, and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot - what exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish, after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet? The answer is to make government bigger ... take more of your money ... give you more orders from Washington ... and to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world. America needs more energy ... our opponent is against producing it. </p> <p>Victory in Iraq is finally in sight ... he wants to forfeit.</p> <p>Terrorist states are seeking nuclear weapons without delay ... he wants to meet them without preconditions.</p> <p>Al Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America ... he's worried that someone won't read them their rights? Government is too big ... he wants to grow it.</p> <p>Congress spends too much ... he promises more. </p> <p>Taxes are too high ... he wants to raise them. His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan, and let me be specific.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes ... raise payroll taxes ... raise investment income taxes ... raise the death tax ... raise business taxes ... and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars. My sister Heather and her husband have just built a service station that's now opened for business - like millions of others who run small businesses. </p> <p>How are they going to be any better off if taxes go up? Or maybe you're trying to keep your job at a plant in Michigan or Ohio ... or create jobs with clean coal from Pennsylvania or West Virginia ... or keep a small farm in the family right here in Minnesota.</p> <p>How are you going to be better off if our opponent adds a massive tax burden to the American economy? Here's how I look at the choice Americans face in this election.</p> <p>In politics, there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers. </p> <p>And then there are those, like John McCain, who use their careers to promote change.</p> <p>They're the ones whose names appear on laws and landmark reforms, not just on buttons and banners, or on self-designed presidential seals. </p> <p>Among politicians, there is the idealism of high-flown speechmaking, in which crowds are stirringly summoned to support great things. </p> <p>And then there is the idealism of those leaders, like John McCain, who actually do great things. They're the ones who are good for more than talk ... the ones we have always been able to count on to serve and defend America. Senator McCain's record of actual achievement and reform helps explain why so many special interests, lobbyists and comfortable committee chairmen in Congress have fought the prospect of a McCain presidency - from the primary election of 2000 to this very day. </p> <p>Our nominee doesn't run with the Washington herd.</p> <p>He's a man who's there to serve his country, and not just his party. </p> <p>A leader who's not looking for a fight, but is not afraid of one either. Harry Reid, the majority leader of the current do-nothing Senate, not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee. </p> <p>He said, quote, \"I can't stand John McCain\". Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps no accolade we hear this week is better proof that we've chosen the right man. Clearly what the majority leader was driving at is that he can't stand up to John McCain. That is only one more reason to take the maverick of the Senate and put him in the White House. My fellow citizens, the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of \"personal discovery.\" This world of threats and dangers is not just a community, and it doesn't just need an organizer. </p> <p>And though both Senator Obama and Senator Biden have been going on lately about how they are always, quote, \"fighting for you,\" let us face the matter squarely. </p> <p>There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you ... in places where winning means survival and defeat means death ... and that man is John McCain. In our day, politicians have readily shared much lesser tales of adversity than the nightmare world in which this man, and others equally brave, served and suffered for their country. </p> <p>It's a long way from the fear and pain and squalor of a six-by-four cell in Hanoi to the Oval Office.</p> <p>But if Senator McCain is elected president, that is the journey he will have made. </p> <p>It's the journey of an upright and honourable man - the kind of fellow whose name you will find on war memorials in small towns across this country, only he was among those who came home. </p> <p>To the most powerful office on earth, he would bring the compassion that comes from having once been powerless ... the wisdom that comes even to the captives, by the grace of God ... the special confidence of those who have seen evil, and seen how evil is overcome. A fellow prisoner of war, a man named Tom Moe of Lancaster, Ohio, recalls looking through a pin-hole in his cell door as lieutenant commander John McCain was led down the hallway, by the guards, day after day.</p> <p>As the story is told, \"When McCain shuffled back from torturous interrogations, he would turn toward Moe's door and flash a grin and thumbs up\" - as if to say, \"We're going to pull through this\". My fellow Americans, that is the kind of man America needs to see us through these next four years. </p> <p>For a season, a gifted speaker can inspire with his words.</p> <p>For a lifetime, John McCain has inspired with his deeds.</p> <p>If character is the measure in this election ... and hope the theme ... and change the goal we share, then I ask you to join our cause. Join our cause and help America elect a great man as the next president of the United States.</p> <p>Thank you all, and may God bless America.</p>"
