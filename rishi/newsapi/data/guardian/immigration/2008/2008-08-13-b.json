  "<h2>Post-it Flag Highlighters</h2> <p>When I first saw these pens (highlighter pens with tiny Post-it notes in the barrel) I thought: \"What a gimmick!\" Fast forward a few weeks and I'm using mine all the time. Just make sure any books you fluoro-up are yours!<br><strong>Price: \u00a32.34 </strong><br><strong>Stockist: <a href=\"http://www.3mselect.co.uk\">3mselect.co.uk</a></strong></p> <h2>Canon Ixus 75</h2> <p>Although this is a little long in the tooth, in my opinion it's still the best small digital camera you can buy. If someone you love is going to university and you want them to stay in touch - they can email you photos - get them this. It takes great pictures easily, and also shoots video. I've even taken pictures of pages of books, as a sort of impromptu photocopying, with it. Make sure you upgrade the memory card though. <br><strong>Price: \u00a3129.99</strong><br><strong>Stockist: <a href=\"http://www.currys.co.uk\">currys.co.uk</a></strong></p> <h2>Griddle pan</h2> <p>Every student knows how important toasted sandwiches are. A sandwich toaster is a beast of limited use, however, and you never seem to be able to get quite enough filling in. Instead, a griddle pan - like a frying pan but with raised ridges - can be used for griddling veg, meats and fish, and if you pair it with a panini press you'll be equipped to create a toasted sandwich of unrivalled deliciousness.</p> <p><strong>Lakeland griddle pan Price: \u00a334.99<br>Stockist: <a href=\"http://www.lakeland.co.uk\">lakeland.co.uk</a> Tel: 01539-488100</strong></p> <h2>Panini press</h2> <p>Although this can be used with any pan, it comes into its own at making black-striped toasted sandwiches when used in conjunction with a griddle pan.

  "<p>A small German town was yesterday reeling from an attack at a popular Italian ice- cream parlour in which three people were shot dead and one was seriously injured. </p> <p>Four men reportedly stormed the De Rocco ice-cream parlour in R\u00fcsselsheim south-west of Frankfurt on Tuesday evening and shot three people dead before fleeing down a street.</p> <p>Two Turkish citizens, aged 49 and 28, were arrested yesterday following a manhunt involving more than 200 police with helicopters and sniffer dogs. Police were continuing their search. </p> <p>One of the victims was a 55-year-old Greek woman identified as Anna K, who ran a Greek restaurant next to De Rocco's. She was caught in the crossfire after leaving the cafe as the dispute escalated, and died from internal bleeding in the arms of her husband at the scene.</p> <p>The two other victims were men of Turkish origin aged 26 and 29. The first was described by police as an attacker, whose 21-year-old brother was seriously injured and under police protection in hospital last night. The second dead man was said to have been sitting at the table when the men opened fire.</p> <p>The attack has raised fears that provincial Germany is becoming a battleground for gang warfare after an incident almost exactly a year ago in which six Italians were gunned down at an Italian-run pizzeria in Duisburg, north-west of Frankfurt. It was quickly established that the Calabrian mafia, known as the 'Ndrangheta, was responsible for that shootout and had taken advantage of the relative obscurity of provincial Germany to continue a decades-old feud. The killings were the first time a mafia syndicate had carried out a revenge attack on foreign soil.</p> <p>Yesterday police refused to rule out a mafia or organised crime connection in the R\u00fcsselsheim killings, but said the Turkish origin of the victims and attackers in the latest incident suggested the attacks were not linked. \"We don't know why the attack took place in the ice-cream parlour,\" Roland Desch of Hessen police said.</p> <p>The brutality of the killings has shocked Germany and raised concerns that it is becoming a hub for economic crime.</p> <p>\"This is a very complex case,\" said Stefan M\u00fcller of the state of Hesse crime squad. He added that the killings, which involved knives as well as two guns, could have been \"honour killings\" which either had to do with a dispute or were sparked by rivalries between gangs. </p> <p>The police said there was evidence that a motive for the attack may have been unpaid gambling winnings and it may be linked to another gambling dispute three years ago. At least two of the men involved in the incident were caught up in a dispute involving knives at a Turkish community centre in R\u00fcsselsheim last Saturday.</p>",
  "<h2>Vandals break window by Chagall in Metz cathedral</h2> <p>Vandals have shattered part of a stained glass window by the artist Marc Chagall at Metz cathedral. The French culture ministry said experts would repair the 60 by 40cm hole by piecing together shards of glass. Emmanuel Etienne, a ministry architect, said the window, completed in 1963, depicted Adam and Eve. He said the vandals climbed on to scaffolding last weekend to break the window and enter the cathedral. Crowns from statues were also stolen and graffiti was scrawled on stones. The ministry said yesterday that those responsible faced up to seven years in prison and a \u20ac100,000 (\u00a380,000) fine. <br><strong>Associated Press in Paris</strong></p> <h2>Kashmir curfew violators warned they face death</h2> <p>Police drove through the deserted streets of a town in Indian Kashmir yesterday blaring warnings from loudspeakers that residents would be shot if they broke a curfew imposed after 16 people were killed in riots between Muslims and Hindus. The violence has rocked the region since June 23 over a plan to transfer land to a Hindu shrine in India's only Muslim-majority state. The warnings in Kishtwar town came a day after thousands violated the curfew to attend the funeral of a separatist leader, Sheikh Abdul Aziz, killed by police while trying to march to the Pakistan-controlled portion of Kashmir. <br><strong>Associated Press in Srinagar</strong></p> <h2>Pirates attack British ship off the Gulf of Aden</h2> <p>Yemeni authorities say pirates have attacked and possibly hijacked a British-flagged commercial ship off the Gulf of Aden. A Yemeni naval official says Aden's port received a distress signal from the ship on Wednesday after it came under heavy attack. After sounding an alarm, port officials lost radio contact with the ship. It was believed to be about 100 miles (160 km) off the coast. Another official said the ship \"has clearly been taken over by the pirates\". Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were told not to talk to the media. The ship, en route from south-east Asia, was carrying wood. <br><strong>Associated Press in San'a</strong></p> <h2>Anti-Iraq army deserter to be deported back to US</h2> <p>One of the first US army deserters from the Iraq war to seek refugee status in Canada is to be deported. Jeremy Hinzman said yesterday that he was ordered out of the country by September 23 by Canada's Border Services Agency. Hinzman deserted in 2004 after learning that his unit was to be deployed to Iraq. He refused to participate in what he calls an immoral and illegal war. \"I'm disappointed, but I think that every soldier that has refused to fight in Iraq has done a good thing and I'm not ashamed,\" Hinzman said after the decision. \"I don't know how political it was. I had a high profile case.\" <br><strong>Associated Press in Toronto</strong></p>",
  "<p>In the vast expanse of sporting occasions such as the Olympic Games one is invariably tempted to grab on to small mercies, even when they are of dubious provenance. Into this category must fall the news of reconciliation between Tom Daley and Blake Aldridge, the British diving pair who fell out when the latter accused the former of buckling under pressure only to be revealed as the kind of colleague who phones his mum in the heat of competition. </p> <p>Those who feared for the future of Britain's unsynchronised synchronised diving team are to worry no longer, according to Daley and Aldridge's team-mates, Sonia Couch and Stacie Powell, who revealed: \"The team are all one big happy family.\"</p> <p>Cynicism in this space has been suspended for the duration of this Olympics but so has credulity. Unlike Aldridge, I would never phone my mum when I'm supposed to be working but when I do get the chance to ask for her opinion on this alleged d\u00e9tente my guess is that she will say what she always says when confronted with the PR piffle dressed up as candour; and the band played Believe It If You Will.</p> <p>This is not to besmirch Couch and Powell, who have Daley's interests foremost in their minds, but simply to draw attention to yet another worrying contribution to an Olympic fairytale that grows less enchanting with every passing day. </p> <p>The media loves a charming, precocious teenager, even to the extent of putting up with blatantly commercial aspects of the teenager's public appearances (one more mention of Team Visa from Daley and I swear I will switch to American Express). But a charming, precocious teenager who finishes last in his event and finds himself in an unseemly squabble?</p> <p>Well, the media is a fickle beast, disinclined to associate itself with what it perceives to be failure except, perhaps, when there is more trouble to be stirred. That, of course, could be the media's problem but for the moment the problem is all Tom Daley's.</p> <p>Such fretting might be misplaced. The teenager still has a chance to wipe away the unpleasantness of the last few days when he competes in the individual 10m platform diving event - the young prince may yet kiss the medal! - but even if that does happen it will not diminish the feeling he should never have been in Beijing in the first place.</p> <p>No doubt some will point to Daley's polished performances in front of the cameras and argue he is well equipped to cope with the attention. But what <br>this argument fails to address is the fact that sometimes preciousness has to be saved from itself. The question right now is this: who will save Tom Daley from himself?</p> <p>Certainly not Steve Foley, the performance director of the British diving team, who was asked this week if he was concerned that the events of the last few days might have damaged the teenager's career. On the contrary, he said, \"all of this will be really good for him in the long run\", before proceeding to evoke a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who goes on to rule the world. \"If you look at theway Earl Woods handled Tiger, he exposed him to pressure situations [like this].\"</p> <p>No doubt Foley knows what he is talking about when it comes to diving, but clearly he knows the square root of diddly-squat when it comes to Earl Woods and his son. Certainly, Tiger appeared on American television at the age of two but when he was old enough to understand what was going on - when it was time for the serious business of making the most of his talent - Earl Woods made sure he did so far from away the public gaze. Tiger was allowed to develop his game, to develop his sense of self, at a pace he dictated and not a pace dictated by others.</p> <p>Woods Sr would no more have allowed his young charge to be exposed to the world's media, aged 14, than he would have allowed him to skip his homework in order to play an extra few holes of golf at night. That's why he can rightly be said to have written the definitive book on how to nurture sporting genius - a book that those people advising Tom Daley need to seek out as soon as possible.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Tom, these people are currently looking in the wrong corner of the bookshop. They should get themselves out of the teenage fantasy section and over to the shelf marked sport and non-fiction.</p> <p><strong>Dubya's flagging appeal a damning indictment </strong></p> <p>As a part-time resident of the United States I have developed a deep affection for the country. I am also proud to have made a lot of good friends over there, none of whom resemble the caricature of the loud-mouthed, ignorant and insular figure peddled by America-haters around the world. They are smart, decent and (in most cases) liberal people. So I can only begin to imagine their embarrassment as they watched George W Bush represent their country in Beijing this week.</p> <p>The evidence of Dubya's visit has been plastered across the world's newspapers and how damning it has been; from the photograph of him apparently examining the backside of a member of the US women's beach volleyball team, to the shot of him at the aquatic centre, as clueless as Forrest Gump, holding the American flag upside down as he cheered on Michael Phelps. It would be funny if he wasn't the occupant of the White House. What a relief it will be for America and Americans - for the world, in fact - when this hapless bozo finally leaves office in January next year.</p> <p><strong>With the greatest respect this was not the greatest</strong></p> <p>The temptation to turn the 2008 Olympics into a contest between the United States and China is understandable. Human curiosity is best engaged by a compelling narrative and what could be more compelling than a narrative that pits East against West, declining superpower against emerging superpower?</p> <p>Sunday evening's basketball match between China and the US was the most obvious example of this obsession, and it was a perfect example of why we should not buy into it. The match was, in essence, a non-event; a walkover dressed up as the \"greatest event\" in the history of the Olympics.</p> <p>As I type this sentence 204 medals have been awarded so far in these Games, of which 53 have gone to either the hosts or the US - a hefty proportion, no doubt, but hardly indicative of what you would call a two-horse race. </p> <p>Anyone who suggests otherwise should be forced to spend five minutes on the judo mat with Elnur Mammadli, who won a gold medal for Azerbaijan in the 73kg division, or race against our very own road cycling gold medal winner Nicole Cooke over 80 miles. They might realise then how disrespectful they are being to the athletes from elsewhere in the world.</p> <p><strong>Read my lips, she wasn't the only one miming</strong></p> <p>A good journalist rarely introduces himself into his work but it was my birthday recently, so I possibly deserve a little leeway. In any case, my own personal experiences as an, ahem, former rock 'n roller might shed some light on the great \"faking\" scandal that has engulfed the Games.</p> <p>Apparently, Lin Miaoke, the nine-year-old girl who \"sang\" Hymn to the Motherland during last Friday's opening ceremony was - shock horror - miming.</p> <p>Big deal. Back in the days when I had a bit more hair and had the chance to appear on Top of the Pops (anyone under 25 should ask their dad), me and my musical colleagues would never have dreamed of doing anything else other than mime. It removed all the variables involved with live television, such as equipment failure and the bass player getting smashed in the BBC bar before show-time.</p> <p>Such experiences also gave me an uncanny ability to tell when people singing \"live\" are in fact doing no such thing. Suffice to say, I would be willing to bet my life that Lin Miaoke wasn't the only one miming last Friday.</p>",
  "<p>You'll need to be the master of your money matters and the boss of your budget when you start university this autumn. </p> <p>Not sure how? Don't worry, you'll be cracking your financial whip in no time once you've read this advice from savvy students and finance experts.</p> <p>\"Keep track of every penny from day one and it'll help avoid more serious financial problems later on,\" says Catherine McGrath, director of current accounts at Lloyds TSB. Sound obvious? Even excessive? Maybe, but it works.</p> <p>The way to do it is to keep a weekly, monthly or termly record of everything you buy so that you can see how much you are spending on food, bills and going out. Then you can work out how to cut back. Student welfare advisers can give you an estimate of typical costs if you aren't sure whether you are over-spending on socialising or transport, for example.</p> <p>Set up a separate bank account with a set amount for your day-to-day spending. This way, the money that's meant to last until the end of term does just that.</p> <p>Next, get yourself discounts on train travel and other stuff with a young person's railcard and a National Union of Students (NUS) card. Make it your business to find out about other offers, such as two-for-one meals at restaurants.</p> <p>\"Think about simple things like making a packed lunch rather than buying a sandwich,\" says McGrath. Consider living with your parents for a bit rather than renting.</p> <p>Here's an absolute must: check you are getting all the cash you are entitled to. There are all sorts of bursaries and grants out there.

It might be useful to see debt in terms of traffic-light colours. Student loans are green because they are pretty safe. Credit cards are orange, so don't overuse them. Store cards and personal unsecured loans are red because they have outrageous rates of interest and steep repayments.</p> <p>\"Keep an eye on how much tax you are paying,\" says David Malcolm, a student finance researcher at the NUS. \"If you earn less than the personal allowance, reclaim your tax.\"</p> <p>And why not make money from your hobby?

  "<p>Roger Landes, who has died aged 91, was a star of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in wartime France. Between 1942 and 1944 his exploits around Bordeaux with the Scientist network saw him organise parachute drops and sabotage before escaping into Spain, returning to France and ultimately clashing with General de Gaulle. His undercover achievements earned him the Military Cross and bar.</p> <p>Landes was born in France. His father was the grandson of a refugee from Russian Poland in 1848; his mother was Russian. They ran a jewellery business in Paris, which collapsed in the Depression. They moved to London, leaving Landes and one of his two brothers to finish their education. The boys also moved to London after the Munich crisis, and Landes, who had graduated from L'\u00c9cole des Beaux Arts, became a quantity surveyor for the London county council.</p> <p>He was called up into the Royal Corps of Signals in March 1941. As he spoke French better than he spoke English, he was interviewed as a possible recruit for SOE. He jumped at the opportunity to go back to France, despite being warned that the chances of his returning alive were about evens. He was commissioned, underwent rigorous training on how to be a secret agent and, as he already knew the Morse code, was trained as a wireless operator.</p> <p>This was one of the most dangerous SOE jobs in western Europe; by 1944 they had a life expectancy of about six weeks, so efficient were the Germans' direction-finding teams. Landes took the warnings seriously, and was never himself in Nazi hands, though he had several near squeaks.</p> <p>On the last night of October 1942, he parachuted into France near Orleans, codenamed Aristide. He was to work around Bordeaux for the formidable Claude de Baissac, who ran the Scientist circuit there. After establishing several wireless sets that worked well, Landes had plenty to do, for the area was full of targets worth attacking, notably the port of Bordeaux itself, which the Germans were using for blockade-running to and from Japan.</p> <p>The attached submarine base was too heavily guarded for SOE to make any mark on it, but the blockade-running ships were another matter - though one of the Scientist teams, armed with SOE's limpet mines and ready to strike, was surprised to see a blockade-runner from Japan sink in front of them. It had been attacked by similar mines laid by Royal Marine commandos, better known as the \"Cockleshell heroes\".</p> <p>As well as sending and receiving reports, Landes' task was to arrange by wireless telegraphy with London all the parachute supply drops of war stores, a complex business. In nine months, he arranged 121 RAF drops.</p> <p>Strictly, Roger was supposed to keep himself to himself. But he and de Baissac were too gregarious for that, and met often. De Baissac introduced Landes to his second-in-command, the far-right Colonel Grandcl\u00e9ment, who nonetheless disapproved of the Vichy collaborationist leader Marshal P\u00e9tain. </p> <p>However, when, in March 1943, de Baissac was flown to England for rest and re-briefing, the Gestapo picked up Grandcl\u00e9ment and persuaded him to change sides to help them fight the Soviet menace.</p> <p>When Grandcl\u00e9ment went to call on a friend, a 50-year-old police inspector, Charles Corbin, Landes was there, along with Madame Corbin and their teenage daughter Ginette. Grandcl\u00e9ment explained that he was going to tell the Germans where the resistance arms were stored. Landes reached for his pistol, but thought he ought not to shoot a man in the presence of ladies. Instead, he and his friends, on bicycles, moved about a third of the arms before Grandcl\u00e9ment's German friends could reach them; Landes and Corbin then got out into Spain, walking through Andorra, and back to England.</p> <p>SOE approved his action, secured him a Military Cross, and parachuted him back in on March 2-3, 1944 to set up a fresh circuit codenamed the Actor in the Bordelais. By the time de Gaulle's regional military director arrived, Landes had already got almost all the potential resisters left in the Bordelais organised to start work when the invasion began. Thereafter the two men worked closely, making life almost unbearable for the local Wehrmacht, which withdrew in August; Landes was awarded a bar to his Military Cross.</p> <p>When de Gaulle went to Bordeaux in September he ordered Landes out of the country instantly. But the order led to a crowd of about 4,000 gathering outside Landes' hotel to demonstrate for the agent and against the general. </p> <p>That October, Landes settled in north London and married Ginette Corbin, with whom he had a son. He remained in the army for a while, and then returned to the LCC architect's department before working for a chain of jewellers, retiring as chief buyer. Ginette died 25 years ago; his second wife, Margaret Laing, whom he married in 1990, and his son from his first marriage survive him.</p> <p>Roger Landes, wartime secret agent, born December 16 1916; died July 15 2008</p>",
  "<p>Russia's unjustified military action in Georgia, an EU and Nato aspirant state, provides the situation to judge whether the European Union has truly come of age and can punch its weight in the world. The suspension of EU-Russia negotiations on a new bilateral pact; freezing talks on visa-free travel for Russian citizens; and holding back EU humanitarian aid to Chechnya until Russia ends aggression in Georgia are three simple actions the EU can take. Once fighting dies down, the EU must also offer to send police to help keep the peace in Georgia's breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abhkazia and speed up free-trade and visa deals with Georgia and Ukraine, showing that those countries are not part of a grey zone for Russia to expand into.</p> <p>Russia's incursion into Georgia has thrown EU-Russia relations into turmoil in the gravest European security crisis since the 1999 Kosovo war. What is now required is for the EU to show that it has the strength and backbone to act and ensure that Russia does not get away with this naked aggression. In the early 1990s the EU let down the people of the Balkans as it stood by while the region tore itself apart, we cannot stand by and let this happen again.<br><strong>Alex Orr </strong><br>Edinburgh </p> <p>One of the arguments put by the Stop the War Coalition against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was that they would lead to ever more wars and global instability in which ordinary people would pay the price. The crisis in Georgia vindicates this argument. \"Georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity should be respected,\" thunders George Bush, the commander-in-chief of an army occupying the sovereign territory of Iraq and Afghanistan and openly preparing to make war on Iran.</p> <p>The same western leaders who earlier this year recognised the independence of Kosovo from Serbia are in no position to criticise Russia's involvement in South Ossetia. The US and UK drove a coach and horses through international law and cynically manipulated the UN - invoking it when it seemed to support their position, ignoring it when it didn't - to make war on Iraq. They mapped out the bloody path that Russia is following today. Who else will go down it tomorrow?<br><strong>Sasha Simic </strong><br>London </p> <p>The South Ossetian conflict raises, yet again, the need for a set of international rules to protect minority populations within states that overrides national sovereignty when those minorities are being abused. Such rules were being discussed as a consequence of the greater Serbian project and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, before they were spuriously used as one of the justifications for the war of aggression against Iraq. Even Russia must surely agree with this proposal now, given this accords with what it has said and done in South Ossetia. A political, diplomatic and legal template is far superior to rockets and war.<br><strong>Joe Murphy </strong><br>Manchester </p> <p>Simon Jenkins's suggestion that situations such as Zimbawbe or the Caucasus should be left to sort themselves out is a sad admission of defeat of liberal conscience (Comment, August 13). I agree President Bush is the last one entitled to lecture others on issues of intervention, and that realism in developing political relationships to prevent conflict is clearly needed. But the abuse of power under humanitarian pretext by the US and others does not make it less important for the world to take its responsibilities to protect people affected by widespread and systematic human rights abuses more seriously. Challenging outdated understandings of absolute state sovereignty, which reduce citizens to subjects of power politics, is essential in a world in which we share a common future.<br><strong>Michael Hammer </strong><br>Executive director, One World Trust </p> <p>\"What can have an impact on the Russians without damaging us more than them,\" asked one European official.

  "<p>The word besprizornik might be variously translated as \"waif\" \"street urchin\" or even \"orphan\", and it points to a social phenomenon in 20th-century Russia which has been hardly visible to many western observers. The upheavals of two world wars, the two revolutions of 1917, the purges of the 1930s and after, and the deportation of entire ethnic groups (especially between 1940 and 1945) left thousands, if not millions, of minors fending for themselves or abandoned to the very untender mercies of Soviet children's homes.</p> <p>The prose writer and liberal activist Anatolii Pristavkin, who has died of pancreatitis aged 76, was himself a besprizornik. The same might be said, in the Soviet context, of the best of his work.</p> <p>While the Soviet Union was in business, Pristavkin was a conventional, sometimes engaging, creator of realist narratives, easily accommodated within the canons of socialist realism while exhibiting civic-mindedness and a liberal view without ever straying into the dissident camp. But as the Soviet system unravelled in the 1980s, he became a champion of liberal values. </p> <p>In interviews he displayed an indulgence to youth's waywardness, which many of his age would not readily share. His argument was that the sins of the fathers had been visited on the sons, and that the older generation should bear its share of the blame. He was instrumental in the founding of the April group, which opposed the conservative establishment within the Writers' Union. In the 1990s he headed the Pardons Commission, which sought to liberalise the Russian justice system, led to the quashing of some 57,000 Soviet-era convictions - and was axed by Vladimir Putin in 2001. </p> <p>Ironically, he was born in Liubertsy, a Moscow suburb that became associated with neo-fascism and skinhead yobbery in the late 1980s. His mother died when he was nine and his carpenter, cobbler and handyman father a few years later. Shunted around various orphanages during the war, he was working in a canning factory at the age of 12.</p> <p>After the war, he worked on the construction of a hydro-electric station in Siberia and at an aviation factory, studied at an aviation institute and, in 1952, was called up in to the army. From 1954 to 1959, he studied at the Gorky Literary Institute in Moscow. By the early 1960s he was on the editorial board of the Young Guard literary journal and he joined the Communist party in 1965. He won the 1978 Writers' Union prize for his book On the Angara.</p> <p>Yet he had a richer and more complex side. The post-Stalin atmosphere was freer and more bewildering, as Nikita Khrushchev, Soviet leader from the mid-1950s, zigzagged between permissiveness and castigation with regard to the arts. When Khrushchev was ousted in 1964 and Leonid Brezhnev came to power, inaugurating \"the period of stagnation\", writers and artists found themselves in more settled, but still complicated times.</p> <p>Pristavkin can be viewed as a barometer of the shifting cultural climate. In 1967 a Soviet reviewer of his novel Golubka noted that the work \"continues his stories about builders, steeplejacks, engineers, hospital nurses, party workers and geologists\", but did not rise to a new level. Yet assessment of Pristavkin changed radically with the appearance of his outstanding novel A Golden Cloud Spent the Night, known in English as The Inseparable Twins (1991). </p> <p>The Russian title refers to a few lines from Lermontov that one of the twins learned in their orphanage. The story is set during the last year of the second world war when a colony of orphans are evacuated to the Caucasus. The 11-year-old heroes, Kolka and Sasha - the inseparable twin brothers - are delighted. Constantly hungry, they have been trying to tunnel into the bakery to steal extra bread.</p> <p>As with Pushkin, Lermontov and Tolstoy before them, the southern mountainous regions of what was once the Russian empire and was then the Soviet Union will offer the brothers freedoms, natural beauty and romanticism not to be found in European Russia. But in 1944 Stalin decided to deport the Chechens from their homeland for alleged Nazi collaboration. The twins are separated by Chechen fighters and Sasha is killed by them. At the end of the book Kolka befriends a Chechen boy, his new \"brother\" despite his being \"black\". The sad, bitter tale ends with the kind of grim irony with which it started: \"Thank you, Comrade Stalin, for our happy childhood.\" </p> <p>The work was finished in 1981 but not published until 1988. Its success rests not just on its literary qualities, but on the fact that it addresses an episode in Soviet history which has become increasingly relevant. The war in Chechnya is not a done deed. Moreover, the book deals head-on with problems of racism. Ostensibly the Soviet Union was a friendship of nations, but in practice it was rife with xenophobia and inter-ethnic tensions which, as current events show, burgeoned horrifically when the old order collapsed. Pristavkin's two subsequent works on the same theme, Cuckoos, or a Sad Song for the Calming of One's Heart (1989), and Riazanka (A Man from the Suburbs) (1991) were less successful.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Marina, two daughters and a son.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Anatolii Ignatievich Pristavkin, writer, born October 17 1931; died July 11 2008</p>",
  "<h2>Couple charged with murder of girl, seven</h2> <p>The mother and stepfather of a seven-year-old girl who allegedly starved to death are to be charged with her murder, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday. A spokeswoman for the CPS said it had authorised West Midlands police to charge Junaid Abuhamza and Angela Gordon with the murder of Khyra Ishaq, who was found dead at her Birmingham home in May. Gordon, 33, and Abuhamza, 29, had been accused of \"causing or allowing\" the death of Khyra, who died after paramedics were called to her home in the early hours of May 17. Both face separate charges of cruelty to five other children.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Hope fades for boy, 14, missing after dive</h2> <p>A search for a 14-year-old boy who went missing while diving with his father was scaled down yesterday as rescuers lost hope of finding him alive. The pair, from South Wales, were diving from an inflatable boat. The boy vanished shortly after they resurfaced off Berry Head near Brixham, Devon. The rest of the diving party - the boy's mother, aunt and uncle - were unable to start the boat. Father and son trod water but the boy suddenly vanished. A rescue operation was launched on Tuesday afternoon.

The incident took place on August 2 but the video only came to light yesterday.

  "<p>The outcome of six grim days of bloodshed in the Caucasus has triggered an outpouring of the most nauseating hypocrisy from western politicians and their captive media. As talking heads thundered against Russian imperialism and brutal disproportionality, US vice-president Dick Cheney, faithfully echoed by Gordon Brown and David Miliband, declared that \"Russian aggression must not go unanswered\". George Bush denounced Russia for having \"invaded a sovereign neighbouring state\" and threatening \"a democratic government\". Such an action, he insisted, \"is unacceptable in the 21st century\".</p> <p>Could these by any chance be the leaders of the same governments that in 2003 invaded and occupied - along with Georgia, as luck would have it - the sovereign state of Iraq on a false pretext at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives? Or even the two governments that blocked a ceasefire in the summer of 2006 as Israel pulverised Lebanon's infrastructure and killed more than a thousand civilians in retaliation for the capture or killing of five soldiers?</p> <p>You'd be hard put to recall after all the fury over Russian aggression that it was actually Georgia that began the war last Thursday with an all-out attack on South Ossetia to \"restore constitutional order\" - in other words, rule over an area it has never controlled since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Nor, amid the outrage at Russian bombardments, have there been much more than the briefest references to the atrocities committed by Georgian forces against citizens it claims as its own in South Ossetia's capital Tskhinvali. Several hundred civilians were killed there by Georgian troops last week, along with Russian soldiers operating under a 1990s peace agreement: \"I saw a Georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children,\" one Tskhinvali resident, Saramat Tskhovredov, told reporters on Tuesday.</p> <p>Might it be because Georgia is what Jim Murphy, Britain's minister for Europe, called a \"small beautiful democracy\". Well it's certainly small and beautiful, but both the current president, Mikheil Saakashvili, and his predecessor came to power in western-backed coups, the most recent prettified as a \"Rose revolution\". Saakashvili was then initially rubber-stamped into office with 96% of the vote before establishing what the International Crisis Group recently described as an \"increasingly authoritarian\" government, violently cracking down on opposition dissent and independent media last November. \"Democratic\" simply seems to mean \"pro-western\" in these cases.</p> <p>The long-running dispute over South Ossetia - as well as Abkhazia, the other contested region of Georgia - is the inevitable consequence of the breakup of the Soviet Union. As in the case of Yugoslavia, minorities who were happy enough to live on either side of an internal boundary that made little difference to their lives feel quite differently when they find themselves on the wrong side of an international state border. </p> <p>Such problems would be hard enough to settle through negotiation in any circumstances. But add in the tireless US promotion of Georgia as a pro-western, anti-Russian forward base in the region, its efforts to bring Georgia into Nato, the routing of a key Caspian oil pipeline through its territory aimed at weakening Russia's control of energy supplies, and the US-sponsored recognition of the independence of Kosovo - whose status Russia had explicitly linked to that of South Ossetia and Abkhazia - and conflict was only a matter of time. </p> <p>The CIA has in fact been closely involved in Georgia since the Soviet collapse. But under the Bush administration, Georgia has become a fully fledged US satellite. Georgia's forces are armed and trained by the US and Israel. It has the third-largest military contingent in Iraq - hence the US need to airlift 800 of them back to fight the Russians at the weekend. Saakashvili's links with the neoconservatives in Washington are particularly close: the lobbying firm headed by US Republican candidate John McCain's top foreign policy adviser, Randy Scheunemann, has been paid nearly $900,000 by the Georgian government since 2004.</p> <p>But underlying the conflict of the past week has also been the Bush administration's wider, explicit determination to enforce US global hegemony and prevent any regional challenge, particularly from a resurgent Russia. That aim was first spelled out when Cheney was defence secretary under Bush's father, but its full impact has only been felt as Russia has begun to recover from the disintegration of the 1990s. </p> <p>Over the past decade, Nato's relentless eastward expansion has brought the western military alliance hard up against Russia's borders and deep into former Soviet territory. American military bases have spread across eastern Europe and central Asia, as the US has helped install one anti-Russian client government after another through a series of colour-coded revolutions. Now the Bush administration is preparing to site a missile defence system in eastern Europe transparently targeted at Russia.</p> <p>By any sensible reckoning, this is not a story of Russian aggression, but of US imperial expansion and ever tighter encirclement of Russia by a potentially hostile power. That a stronger Russia has now used the South Ossetian imbroglio to put a check on that expansion should hardly come as a surprise. What is harder to work out is why Saakashvili launched last week's attack and whether he was given any encouragement by his friends in Washington.</p> <p>If so, it has spectacularly backfired, at savage human cost. And despite Bush's attempts to talk tough yesterday, the war has also exposed the limits of US power in the region. As long as Georgia proper's independence is respected - best protected by opting for neutrality - that should be no bad thing. Unipolar domination of the world has squeezed the space for genuine self-determination and the return of some counterweight has to be welcome. But the process of adjustment also brings huge dangers. If Georgia had been a member of Nato, this week's conflict would have risked a far sharper escalation. That would be even more obvious in the case of Ukraine - which yesterday gave a warning of the potential for future confrontation when its pro-western president threatened to restrict the movement of Russian ships in and out of their Crimean base in Sevastopol. As great power conflict returns, South Ossetia is likely to be only a taste of things to come. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Emma Pooley would not reveal yesterday whether she would permit herself an ice-cream after second place to Kristin Armstrong of the United States earned her the Olympic medal that she had been working towards for the best part of a year. She has a penchant for gelato and her self-imposed ban is not supposed to end until September, after the world road-race championships, but her spectacular ride up and down the Ju-Yong pass was surely grounds enough for relenting.</p> <p>The 25-year-old has the tiny form (7st 5lb) and ascetic habits of the true climber, sharing with the legendary Robert Millar a love of chocolate, and with other mountaineers a self-deprecating obsession with spare pounds. Wearing a watch, she joked, might have cost a second, while it was hard to tell whether she was serious in claiming the staff had sought out extra-small safety pins for her race numbers.</p> <p>In theory climbers put out less power, so are at a disadvantage when time-trialling to beefy individuals such as the men's winner Fabian Cancellara, but Pooley's medal disproved that. While her searing ascent of the pass put her in the medal frame in the 14.7-mile event, it was sealed on the wide downhill roads to the finish.</p> <p>\"This course was uniquely suited to her, uphill then down, with the descent not being technical,\" the British performance director Dave Brailsford pointed out. \"She is one of the best climbers in the world, but [downhill] she punches such a small hole in the air and she is so strong, putting out so much power for such a small body, that she can drive it there as well.\"</p> <p>The time checks showed that while Pooley was fastest to the top, spinning her little gear where others laboured, she was fifth fastest on the descent. Critically, however, against the other potential medallists, she lost substantial time only to Armstrong, who gained 28sec and the gold medal.</p> <p>She had spoken before the time-trial about the need to have the right frame of mind and indeed, during the contre la montre, she actually pretended she had escaped in the road race and was riding as hard as she could with the peloton on her heels. Nicole Cooke pushed the pace hard as well yesterday for her 15th place but the conditions were grim and she confessed afterwards that she had not recovered from her gold medal effort as she would have liked.</p> <p>As with her team-mate's gold on Sunday, the back-room boffins played a vital part in Pooley's improvement on her eighth place in last year's world championship. \"I know it's not supposed to be about the bike but a lot of it was. Up to now I've never had an aerodynamic time-trial position because I've never had a bike that fitted me.\"</p> <p>She had to work hard on that flat-backed position and inevitably called in the Secret Squirrels, the scientific research team led by Chris Boardman and Dimitris Katsanis. The result was a new set of handlebars, milled from a single block of aluminium, to enable her to rest her hands on the brake levers as she would while climbing a mountain on her road-racing bike, before switching into an aerodynamic tuck position for the descent. \"A beautiful piece of kit, an engineer's wet dream,\" as she put it. Critically the bars also allowed her to use the gear levers while keeping her hands in the climbing position.</p> <p>On the one hand, Pooley is still an engagingly starry-eyed ing\u00e9nue at international level, able to describe the beaten world champion Karen Thurig as \"one of my heroes\"... curious about the intricacies of the madison and team sprints and happy to mention having sympathy for beaten opponents before reminding herself she has to be \"steel\". </p> <p>She certainly has a tough enough core, asking not to be cast as a saint for making the escape in the road race which had set up Cooke's gold medal. \"Don't big me up, it wasn't entirely selfless. It helped her and it could have worked for me.\" It may not have been a totally selfless move but there was a distinct sense that her medal yesterday was all the more meritorious.</p> <p>In the men's event, over two laps of the road-race circuit to the women's one, Britain's Steve Cummings finished a creditable 11th behind Cancellara, who had failed to show his very best time-trial form in the Tour de France but made up for it here. The double world champion suffered, though, as most of the field did, on the second climb to the fortress, losing ground to Gustav Larsson of Sweden, who left the Swiss with a six-second deficit to make up on the final descent.</p> <p>In a final blast down the pass that was reminiscent of the high-speed descent that won him the bronze medal on Saturday, Cancellara pulled back that deficit and pulled out a 33sec lead, with Levi Leipheimer of the US taking the bronze behind Larsson. For Britain, however, the women had made the running and put GB's cyclists in an unprecedented position: on top of the two-wheeled medal table after the road events.</p>",
  "<p>If the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/world/europe/14georgia.html\">shaky cease-fire</a> takes hold in Georgia, then the 21st century's version of the Six Day war may mercifully be coming to an end. That will come as a relief - especially for those caught up in the fighting, and for American and European leaders whose <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/08/20080809-2.html\">impotence</a> in stopping the Russian advance has been laid bare before the world.</p> <p>The unfortunate lesson of the Russo-Georgian war is that this is the first tangible example outside of the Middle East of how George Bush's catastrophic foreign policy has weakened the US and the West. The next American president has been dealt a terrible hand - but he must take immediate steps to prevent this situation from getting worse.</p> <p>The root causes of the West's alarming helplessness lie in the broad strategic failure of the Bush administration's foreign policy. It first alienated and then <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1392791.stm\">badly misread Putin's character and intentions</a>, only realising his true threat to Western interests after it was too late. The administration then invaded Iraq, splitting the Western alliance, undermining international institutions, and bogging down American troops in a long and bloody occupation that has eroded the West's deterrent force. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib have weakened respect for international norms and further damaged <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/27/news/pew.php\">American global leadership</a>. Iran has been the major regional beneficiary of the US invasion, projecting power across the Middle East through its support of militants in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. </p> <p>America's struggles, Iran's gains and Israel's fears together significantly increase Russia's leverage and influence. The US and Europe need Russian cooperation to curtail Iranian nuclear weapons development because Moscow can make or break economic sanctions and any long term solution is going to require Russian support.</p> <p>Beyond these strategic gifts from the US, Russia itself has gained strength and is no longer the weak and declining superpower that characterised much of the post-Soviet period. A booming economy built on soaring energy prices and a strong autocratic government have fed into Putin's efforts to restore the confidence and pride of the once-great Russian nation. This new Russia now seeks to reclaim its place on the world stage.</p> <p>In a feeble bid to push back, the Bush administration feted the democratically elected governments of Ukraine and Georgia as the antidote to the Kremlin's ambitions. Bush went to Tbilisi and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/05/20050510-2.html\">promised the Georgians</a> that \"as you build a free and democratic Georgia, the American people will stand with you.\" Georgia even sent 2,000 troops to fight in Iraq. It was not unreasonable for the Georgians to think that America would back them. Of course Putin knew that it could not. </p> <p>John McCain has no understanding of just how weak America's position is in this crisis and his response has been to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/us/politics/12mccain.html\">escalate the confrontation</a> with Russia - putting America and the world on a dangerous course towards conflict should he become US president. Drawing <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/12/AR2008081202935.html\">obvious allusions</a> to Hitler's march into the Sudetenland, McCain said of Russia's rout of Georgian forces: \"we learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked.\" He compounds the irresponsible rhetoric of the Bush administration, yet he proposes nothing to address America's complete lack of leverage. </p> <p>Even though it is unlikely that Russia will again resort to force in the near future, it is guaranteed to press its advantage in countries like Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. If America and the West are to summon any meaningful response, we must stop issuing hollow threats and begin to address Russia's current points of leverage. </p> <p>The first step is to get serious about resolving the nuclear standoff with Iran. Putin's trump card is that the West is appropriately more concerned about an aggressive nuclear armed Iran than it is about Russia asserting control over its near abroad. Russia's clear power play has raised the stakes in reaching an acceptable settlement with Tehran and we simply cannot allow that process to drag on indefinitely while Russia presses its advantage and Israel grows more concerned. </p> <p>A great deal of Russia's economic power is based on rising energy prices and its massive reserves of natural gas. That is not likely to change in the short term, but it is possible to lower energy costs and lessen the strategic importance of fossil fuel reserves by transforming our economies to run on renewable energy sources. This would create a finite time horizon after which Russia's dominant energy position will be less significant. </p> <p>The energy boom has generated enormous wealth in Russia that has covered over numerous looming crises. Its public institutions are rife with corruption, its infrastructure is crumbling, its health system is a shambles, and it is facing a demographic time bomb of an aging population and a rapidly declining birth-rate. These are all areas in which the US and Europe can help improve the lives of the Russian people. Doing so would require a difficult shift in the orientation of aid programs away from a focus on democracy promotion, but it has the chance of reversing the reputation of the West within Russia and lessening the appetite for confrontation. </p> <p>These soft power moves must also be accompanied by the restoration of the credibility of American hard power by bringing the occupation of Iraq to a responsible conclusion. Only then can we reset our military forces and restore their deterrent capabilities. Russia does not want to get into a shooting war with the United States. It can act aggressively now because it knows that is not a realistic possibility. A credible deterrent of strong and united Western forces would surely help dissuade Putin from rash actions.</p> <p>Barack Obama has put forward a comprehensive foreign and security policy compatible with each of these steps: early and high-level negotiations with Iran; transitioning towards a green economy; emphasising human dignity and peoples' needs and aspirations in US aid programs; and ending the war in Iraq. John McCain proposes doing none of these things as he hurtles towards confrontation with both Russia and Iran, seemingly intent on turning this bad situation into a terrifying one.</p>",
  "<p>As I locked the door of my apartment in Tbilisi at around midnight and got in a car to head for the border, I felt like a traitor. I was leaving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgia</a> at a moment when my adopted home, and my friends there, felt more threatened than they had been in many years. I had my own reasons \u2013 the impending birth of my first child \u2013 but I still felt I was deserting them.</p> <p>I lingered for a while at my local shop, where a small crowd of neighbours had gathered around an old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lada\">Lada</a> with its radio on, trying to work out exactly how close the Russian tanks were to the capital. \"You're the foreigner who lives here,\" one of them correctly identified me, before asking, \"Will the west help us, or are we on our own?\"</p> <p>That was one of the questions that many people have been asking over the past few days in Tbilisi, as the crushing reality of Georgia's defeat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia6\">has become clear</a>. There's been a sense of disillusionment that the government's western allies, particularly the United States, haven't been more robust in their response in their response to Moscow's military assault.</p> <p>\"Where is Bush? Where are his weapons?\" demanded one woman, who had fled to the capital from her village in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia\">South Ossetia</a>. She pointed out that Georgians had died in Iraq while serving alongside the US president's military mission there. \"But when we needed him,\" she cried, \"all he gave us was words.\" </p> <p>Many people do seem to have had unrealistic expectations that the US and the EU would ride to the rescue. But that doesn't mean that their feeling that the west has left them alone to face the might of the Russian army isn't genuine.</p> <p>Other locals spoke of bringing their old guns out of their basements and cleaning them, ready to resist the Russians, guerrilla-style, if they advanced on the capital. One of my best friends, a child psychologist, whom one could never describe as warlike, told me that the Georgian army had to fight on to the end, to show the world that Russia's behaviour was simply unacceptable in the 21st century \u2013 even if, she declared, that meant that everyone had to die.</p> <p>Many Georgians have been unwilling to criticise President <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/10/russia.georgia2\">Mikheil Saakashvili</a>'s strategy publicly while Russian tanks are rolling across Georgian soil and Russian warplanes are in Georgian skies. Even <a href=\"http://blogs.tol.org/conflicts/\">some of the people</a> who accused Saakashvili of falsifying elections earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia1\">have rallied</a> behind the war effort.</p> <p>But privately, a few have expressed concerns that Saakashvili \u2013 or \"Misha\", as he's known to almost everyone in Georgia \u2013 might have made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/10/georgia.russia\">a fatal miscalculation</a> in trying to seize back control of South Ossetia from the Moscow-backed separatists, thus invoking the wrath of a ruthless Kremlin. \"Didn't Misha remember what Putin did in Chechnya?\" a student friend asked me. </p> <p>No one really knows how many have died in this conflict so far. But many people have lost friends. I want to take this opportunity to remember <a href=\"http://www.caucasus-images.com/?ID=VD5K6KSAKQ\">Alexander Klimchuk</a>, colleague and occasional beer-drinking companion, a 27-year-old Georgian photojournalist who <a href=\"http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=28135&amp;annee=2008\">was shot dead</a> in unclear circumstances while photographing the fighting in South Ossetia a few days ago.</p> <p>Last autumn, Klimchuk and I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/11/popandrock2\">worked together</a> in South Ossetia, covering a government-sponsored <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7042807.stm\">Boney M concert</a> in a remote, impoverished village. It was a surreal day, and we spent most of the time laughing and joking as the disco veterans belted out hits like \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFHNOpukeEQ\">Daddy Cool</a>\" in the middle of what was then a \"frozen\" conflict zone. </p> <p>That seems a long time ago, and now the village is deserted and Klimchuk is dead \u2013 another victim of the latest brutal conflict in a country most people couldn't find on a map.</p>",
  "<p>\"In the beginning God created man,\" booms a voice, to the sound of sirens and gunfire. If only this outdoor visual extravaganza courtesy of Russia's Teatr Novogo Fronta lived up to its bombastic opening.</p> <p>The world has been destroyed. A shaven-headed clown emerges from the rubble in a torn, dust-covered suit with a battered briefcase. He promptly keels over, but is resurrected several times before being shot by men in white boiler suits and shades.</p> <p>In more cheerful scenes a pair of strange creatures, one resembling an Ewok, the other a scarecrow, caper about and pratfall like something from a particularly freaky kids' TV show. A man sporting a straggly, spaghetti-like moustache arrives in a BMW, ascends a makeshift platform and gyrates his hips for a while. Two people don ice skates and attempt to skate on gravel. Next thing you know, you're watching projected images of human suffering and brutality.</p> <p>According to the publicity material, Phantomysteria \"are allegories of an apocalyptic catastrophe which are a consequence of discovering a way to fulfil everyone's wishes\". Sadly, the production's attempts to evoke a labyrinth of apocalyptic menace fall flat. The evening is swathed in smoke and strobe-lighting, as if the company were hoping to disguise how little there is between their show's ears.</p> <p>Occasionally things do kick into delirious life. There are some memorable images - as when a man dances with a blood-red puppet - but the show can't sustain its moods of foreboding and mad exhilaration. There's a vacancy at its heart: Phantomysteria has nothing to launch from, no discernible arguments, narrative or intellectual meaning. Even within the hour the piece feels like a gaga endurance test.</p>",

  "<p>Lebanon's fragile status quo suffered a new blow today when a bomb killed 18 people in the northern port city of Tripoli, the scene of recent sectarian clashes.</p> <p>The blast came just before President Michel Suleiman left for a landmark visit to Syria \u2014 a sign of the improving relations between the two neighbours and a day after Beirut's new national unity government won a parliamentary vote of confidence after weeks of stormy debates.</p> <p>Ten of the dead were soldiers and 30 other people were wounded in the remote-controlled explosion at a bus stop during morning rush hour in a busy shopping street. A baby and an eight-year-old shoeshine boy were also among the dead.</p> <p>No claim of responsibility was made, but suspicion quickly fell on Fatah al-Islam, an extremist Sunni group with links to al-Qaida that fought the Lebanese army for three months last year and has vowed revenge against its then commander \u2014 now the president.</p> <p>Suleiman condemned what he called a \"terrorist crime\" before leaving for Damascus, where his talks with President Bashar al-Assad were billed as the start of a new era following the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon in 2005 after nearly three decades of military domination of its \"sister\" nation. That was triggered by outrage over the assassination of the former prime minister, Rafiq al-Hariri, in a Beirut bomb blast in which Syria has consistently denied charges of involvement.</p> <p>Today's attack in Tripoli was a bloody beginning for the new 30-member cabinet, led by Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, formed last month, with the participation of the Iranian-backed Shia group Hizbullah, after a long crisis that descended into violence that killed 65 people in May.</p> <p>Tripoli, Lebanon's second city, has been rocked by clashes between Siniora's anti-Syrian supporters and rivals loyal to Damascus, with an alarmingly sectarian cast to fighting between Sunnis and Alawite gunmen in which 23 people were killed last month. The nearby Palestinian refugee camp of Nahr al-Bared saw nearly four months of heavy fighting last year between Fatah and the Lebanese army, one of the few truly \"national\" institutions in a still bitterly divided country.</p> <p>Nabih Berri, the Lebanese parliament speaker, said the timing of the Tripoli bombing reflected efforts \"to prevent the improvement of Lebanese-Syrian relations.\" The Arab League secretary-general, Amr Mussa, said it was \"aimed at complicating the security and political situation in Lebanon and hampering the launch of the new government.\"</p>",
  "<p>A small German town was today reeling from an attack at a popular Italian ice-cream parlour in which three people were shot dead and one was seriously injured. </p> <p>Four men reportedly stormed the De Rocco ice-cream parlour in R\u00fcsselsheim south-west of Frankfurt yesterday evening and shot three people dead before fleeing down a pedestrian street.</p> <p>Two Turkish citizens, aged 49 and 28, were arrested today following a manhunt involving more than 200 police with helicopters and sniffer dogs. Police were continuing their search. </p> <p>One of the victims was a 55-year old Greek woman identified as Anna K, who ran a Greek restaurant next to the ice-cream parlour. She was caught in the crossfire after leaving the cafe as the dispute escalated, and died from internal bleeding in the arms of her husband at the scene.</p> <p>The two other victims were men of Turkish origin aged 26 and 29. The first was described by police as being one of the attackers. His 21-year-old brother was also seriously injured and under police protection in hospital last night. The second dead man was said to have been sitting at the table when the men opened fire.</p> <p>The attack has raised fears that provincial Germany is becoming a battleground for gang warfare after an incident almost exactly a year ago in which six Italians were gunned down at an Italian-run pizzeria in Duisburg, north-west of Frankfurt. It was quickly established that the Calabrian mafia, known as the 'Ndrangheta, was responsible for that shootout and had taken advantage of the relative obscurity of provincial Germany to continue a decades-old feud. The killings were the first time a mafia syndicate had carried out a revenge attack on foreign soil.</p> <p>Today police refused to rule out a mafia or organised crime connection in the R\u00fcsselsheim killings, but said the Turkish origin of the victims and attackers in the latest incident suggested the attacks were not linked. </p> <p>\"We don't know why the attack took place in the ice cream parlour,\" Roland Desch of Hessen police said.</p> <p>The brutality of the killings has shocked Germany and raised concerns that it is becoming a hub for underground economic crime.</p> <p>\"This is a very complex case,\" said Stefan M\u00fcller of the state of Hesse crime squad. He added that the killings, which involved knives as well as two guns, could have been \"honour killings\" which either had to do with a dispute between two parties, or were sparked by rivalries between two gangs. </p> <p>The police said there was evidence that a motive for the attack may have been unpaid gambling winnings and be linked to another gambling dispute three years ago. At least two of the men involved in the incident were caught up in a dispute involving knives at a Turkish community centre in R\u00fcsselsheim last Saturday to which the police were called.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>There will not be many 74-yard Hollywood passes flayed into the stands this evening, there's a prediction for you. But why am I predicting this?</strong> Reina, Arbeloa, Dossena, Carragher, Agger, Alonso, Plessis, Benayoun, Kuyt, Keane, Torres.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>objectivity <em>n.</em> the ability to perceive or describe something without being influenced by personal emotions or prejudices.</strong> \"Tap-up kings Liverpool,\" begins level-headed soccer analyst George Templeton, \"will be stuffed tonight by Standard Liege. After all the chicanery that fat sod Rafa Benitez and Scouse show pony Steven Gerrard have pulled to take Gareth Barry away from Villa, it would serve them right to get humbled by the Belgians and fall into the Uefa Cup. A pox on all of them and their ridiculous ownership too!\" We might as well start a new season of minute-by-minute reports with a virtual fistfight, I guess. At least then the only way will be up. <em>[Guardian legal disclaimer: the only way may not be up]</em></p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Harry Kewell's Amazing Champions League Career:</strong> It continues apace. His new side Galatasaray are 2-0 down at home after 12 minutes of their first leg against Steaua Bucharest. Admittedly Kewell is not playing, but still.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Having said that...</strong> it's now 1-2.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>All the team news I've yet to give you, starting with Standard Liege:</strong> Espinosa, Dante, Dalmat, Defour, Mbokani, De Camargo, Mikulic, Camozzato, Sarr, Fellaini, Witsel.</p> <p><strong>The home bench:</strong> Devriendt, Goreux, Toama, Benko, Nicaise, Ingrao, Dembele.</p> <p><strong>The Liverpool bench:</strong>: Cavalieri, Hyypia, Gerrard, Voronin, Pennant, Insua, El Zhar.</p> <p><strong>And the referee:</strong> Tom Ovrebo (Norway)</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Liverpool are playing in their 35th kit, green shirts and black shorts reminiscent of the Souness era. Standard Liege are playing in their red home shirts. It's raining. LFC stroke it around the back for a bit. Meanwhile the virtual fistfight begins. \"Where exactly was the tapping up of Garry Barry?\" asks Nathan Smith. \"The way I read about it, Liverpool made a bid, it was rejected, and then Martin O'Neill started bleating to the press about it every few minutes. Robbie Keane, on the other hand\u2026\" And he's not finished there, another email pinging here seconds after: \"So Alonso starts, so is presumably staying at Anfield. Meaning no Gareth Barry transfer, meaning several rainforests were felled for a non-existent transfer. Don't tell Al Gore.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> The Belgian champions haven't had a sniff of the ball yet, Liverpool quite happy to get a feel of the thing for themselves.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Liverpool are looking to the flanks early on. Arbeloa shakes his hips and gives the ball to Plessis down the right; the French youngster lays off to Kuyt, who attempts to find Alonso by lifting the ball over the Liege back four, but the pass bounds out of play. A bright enough start.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> What luck for Liverpool. Arbeloa elbows Fellaini off the ball down the Liege left. From the free kick and six yards out, the injured party heads (with, er, his shoulder) the ball onto the inside of the left-hand post. The ball's surely going in, but it takes a load of backspin and sails across the face of goal, allowing Reina to claw away. An amazing escape; Liege should have been one up. \"Looky here, I don't mean to ruffle your feathers or spoil those last few sips of canteen cuppa, but your mate Paul Doyle's almost halfway into the first half of commentary on the Arsenal match while we're stuck staring at the team sheets,\" writes Lexie Patten. \"What gives?\" This game kicked off at 8.05pm, Lexie, I think I might have forgotten to mention that. Seeing nobody other than you noticed, I might take half an hour off during the interval.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> A free kick up the other end, 30 yards out to the left. Alonso aims for the top-left corner but succeeds only in smashing it straight into the wall. This is a really bright opening to the match. I still have no idea how Fellaini's effort stayed out of the Liverpool net.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 min: PENALTY TO LIEGE!!! AND WHAT A DEBUT FOR DOSSENA!!!</strong> A Liege cross from the right hits Dossena's left hand. It's a free kick alright, but the Italian defender is outside the area. A terrible decision.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Yet again, Reina saves from the spot! Dante's kick isn't brilliant, allowing the keeper to block with his legs while diving to his right. This has been one wretched start by Liverpool, who despite it all must suddenly feel like they are a goal or two up.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> I <em>still</em> can't believe how that Fellaini chance stayed out.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Alonso concedes a corner, from which Liverpool once again look all over the shop under a high ball. If Fellaini timed his jump properly - this time it comes off his back! - he would have scored then from six yards out. Liverpool are a complete shambles at the back, and not looking particularly confident in the centre of the park either.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Witsel threads a lovely ball down the inside-left channel which finds Fellaini in space, though he's marginally offside. Liverpool are riding their luck here, as feather-spitting, virtual-punch-throwing Villa fan George Templeton would surely agree: \"Steven Gerrard turned his head and tapped him during the England friendlies, Liverpool makes a bid and then made it public to unsettle Barry. Martin O'Neill didn't start complaining until Rafa Benitez made the amazing statement in the Guardian 'Well Aston Villa have a problem, their captain wants to leave.' Outrageous! And whose idea was it for Barry to go yammering to the News and the World with all kids of bull about O'Neill not talking to him? I would bet Gerrard and Barry's agent cooked up that bit of bilge.\" And breathe. \"And by the way on the Robbie Keane, Tottenham bitterly complained about the same kind of behavior. Liverpool will probably get their man, but karmic revenge is coming, if not in this tie then on Aug. 31 when Littlepool comes to Villa Park!\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Alonso, Arbeloa and Torres link up down the right. Torres cuts inside and rolls a square ball across the face of the Liege area towards Benayoun, but it's easily cut out. Better by Liverpool, but only slightly.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Is Keane playing?</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Liverpool knock it around the back for a minute or so in the hope of calming it down. Finally Agger hoofs it forward towards Dossena, who volleys first time into the centre towards the onrushing Kuyt, but Espinosa comes out to claim.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Alonso picks up a yellow card for a late challenge on De Camargo.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Now Camozzato is booked for scything straight through the back of Torres. This game has slowed up a bit all of a sudden, which will please Liverpool.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Robbie Keane has touched the ball! He has touched it! Admittedly he immediately loses it, allowing Liege to scamper upfield, but small acorns and all that. \"There's very little that George Templeton can say about Liverpool that would make me feel any worse than what's happening while following the MBM and listening to the commentary through the team's site,\" writes James Kogutkiewicz. \"Yeah, whatever George, my team's being torn apart by STANDARD LIEGE!!!\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> A wonderful cameo from Benayoun there, who skips around three challenges in the centre of the park and bustles forward. The move fizzles out quickly, but that's the first time in the match a Liverpool player has taken the ball on with confidence. Simmering down and not trying to ping every single ball first time might be an idea.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Alonso, who has at least been putting himself about, is hacked down 35 yards out, slightly to the left. He whips in a ferocious bending shot which only just sails over the bar; a couple of inches lower and that would have been whizzing into the top-right corner.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Keane has touched it again. This time it's a miscontrol which nearly sets Witsel free into the Liverpool half. Hmm. This is, it's only fair to note, still technically pre-season.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Plessis sticks the nut on the back of De Carmargo's head. The Liege man crumples in pain, though there was no intent there.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> A beautiful back-heel by Alonso - who has been Liverpool's best player by a long chalk, though that's not saying much in itself - nearly releases Kuyt down the inside right channel, but the striker tries an exquisite flick of his own towards Benayoun and... well, let's just say the juxtaposition is not particularly favourable to the hard-working Dutchman. \"A lot of George Templeton's ire seems to be caused by non sequiturs and conjecture,\" suggests Naill Glynn. \"I'd lay good money that he's a conspiracy theorist so here's my tuppence ha'penny; Gareth Barry was visited by the ghost of Emlyn Hughes, Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley who all told him to join Liverpool. He made Rafa aware of this and set the wheels in motion. I accept that this rumour may seem derivative of the story that went with Zidane's return to the French fold before WC2006 but it probably has as much truth as Templeton's diatribe.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Standard Liege 0-0 Liverpool. MORAL SCORELINE: Standard Liege 2-0 Liverpool.</strong> This has been a desperately poor half of football from Liverpool. The only way this season is up. Two great saves from Reina, mind, and a hard-working display from Alonso. \"I don't care how badly they are playing, or how useless Keane is proving to be thus far,\" sobs Dave Douglas, \"I'm still not lamenting the exit of Crouchie.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>The best pun we're going to get today, right here:</strong> \"Liverpool are being done by Standard Liege. Imagine if they had to face Special Liege, let alone Export Liege or Wicked Super-Strength Liege. Maybe they should change their own name to Substandard Liverpool.\" Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Robin Hazlehurst. \"PS,\" he adds, \"I love it when you smoke your cigarettes.\" After that, I can only oblige, Robin. Back in a sec.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> No changes. \"Have to say,\" David Powell feels he has to say, \"this sounds like quintessential Champions League Liverpool: scratching along, not playing that well, total absence of attacking cohesion, hopeful punts up the line by the full-backs, comedy backheels by Dirk Kuyt... all that remains is a breakaway goal and whaddaya know? The reds go through!\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Liverpool again look slightly uneasy underneath a high ball in the box. Reina gets his defenders, who are spinning like tops, out of trouble by clattering into one of them - Agger - and somehow winning a free kick.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Dossena lifts a ball into the centre from the left. It's missed by two Liege defenders and sails towards Benayoun on the edge of the six-yard box, but the midfielder is taken by surprise and lets the ball bounce behind him.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Brilliant work by Witzel down the left, who skins Arbeloa and Carragher and rolls a ball into the centre towards De Camargo. Standing on the penalty spot, he simply has to pick where to hammer the ball home, but his effort is woeful; Plessis calmly traps the slowly rolling ball and whips it clear. Liverpool are having a shocker here; it can only be time before Benitez makes a Steven Gerrard-shaped change.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Marcos sprays a lovely right-to-left ball to free Witzel. He's in miles of space! What on earth is Arbeloa doing? The right back eventually makes up some ground and blocks Witzel's cross, conceding a corner which is wasted. This is really poor from Liverpool. \"If you're doing moral scorelines,\" writes Luke Kelly, \"you ought to work out a system. If it's just based on attacking football and prettiness, Arsenal would win everything, so you should lose points for insufferableness, wearing gloves, pouting and shrugging and so on. Counter intuitively, I think Chelsea should earn moral points for the brazenness of their evil club schtick. It goes without saying that Liverpool should always start on \u201350.\" This debate can only go a sour way out.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Torres nearly latches onto a long ball but Espinosa rushes out of his goal to hoof clear. That's as exciting as it's been up front for Liverpool this evening. Something has to change. It <em>has</em> to. \"I am deeply offended by the anti-Liverpool piffle in this MBM. It's all unfounded hearsay, anyways \u2013 like accusing all of us Liverpool supporters of being plastic fans who live in the States. Ridiculous. Yours, Scott Connolly, Olympia, Washington, USA.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Defour volleys from the edge of the area; Alonso does well to deflect away for a corner. From it, Liverpool sweep upfield and put together their best move of the match, Kuyt, Benayoun and Torres switching passes and positions all the way up the right wing. As they reach the area, Kuyt's final ball towards Torres is slightly too heavy and cleaned up by Dante, but that was much, much better. \"I know I shouldn't rise to the bait, but since David Powell stuck his oar in, I will,\" says Nathan Smith, narrowing his eyes while rolling up his shirt sleeves. \"One Champions League win, one final defeat, and one-semi final cannot be achieved by luck alone. I'm also sure I saw some attacking cohesion in that 8-0 shellacking of Besiktas last year.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Liverpool are yet to create a chance, but they are at least now pressing Liege back a wee bit. The last couple of minutes have seen a corner, plus a couple of balls into the home box, one of them even initially won by a Liverpool head.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> What a miss by De Camargo - again - and this chance really should have ended up in the net. Dante swings a peach of a cross into the area; with only Agger in the box, De Camargo easily gets to the ball first. He should head home into the bottom left corner, but somehow skews it wide. More luck for Liverpool.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> That's the end of Keane's debut. He nearly gets a toe to a loose ball in the Liege area but misses; seconds later he's replaced by Steven Gerrard. Speaking of whom, George Templeton is not letting this Barry-Gerrard business lie: \"Of course Liverpool would never break the rules and no one could ever turn down the glorious Liverpool. Are there suppositions in some of my accusations? Yes, but the balance of my screed against Liverpool comes out of articles that have appeared on this very site. I didn't imagine Benitez's quote, it happened. I didn't imagine Barry lying about what discussions he had with O'Neill, it happened. I didn't imagine the fact that the only time Steven Gerrard's shown up in an England shirt, Barry was playing next to him, it happened!\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Fellaini meanders up and down Plessis's leg awhile. The ref fails to notice.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Dossena hares down the left and wins a corner. The deep ball is headed out on the other side. Gerrard swings the second corner in from the right; it's punched out by Espinosa straight to Alonso, who steers the ball wide but is fouled while doing so. This free kick is dead central, just outside the area. Up steps Gerrard...</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> ... but there's to be no immediate fairytale. Not a bad effort, though, only just going over the bar, not far from the top left corner.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Dear me, Liverpool are appalling at the back. Defour swings in a ball from the left which splits the entire back line into pieces; De Camargo gets his head to the cross and nicks it over the advancing Reina and towards the empty net - but with little pace on the ball, the effort is eventually hacked clear. How Standard Liege have failed to score tonight is beyond me.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> A simply fantastic reverse ball into the box from the left by Gerrard - it was threaded past three men! - finds Benayoun in acres. Lovely stuff, and for a second a goal looks certain, but sadly for Liverpool Benayoun is inexplicably flagged offside despite half the Liege team practically standing on the goal line.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Dalmat loops a high ball into the Liverpool area. Despite both Carragher and Agger being in attendance, the ball is allowed to bounce. This is a defending basic, surely? What on earth has happened to the Liverpool back four? Apart from Carragher's legs beginning to go, obviously?</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Substitution for Liverpool: Kuyt is going off, to be replaced by Nabil El Zhar.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Torres is still on the pitch, just in case you were wondering.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Benayoun and Gerrard nearly bluster straight through the centre of the Liege defence with a couple of nifty shimmies and shakes, but eventually a toe pokes the ball away from the Liverpool duo. They've linked up quite well in the few minutes they've been playing together, one of the very few shafts of light for Liverpool this evening.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> El Zhar looks to poke the ball past Mikulic down the right wing and scoot free into the Liege half, but he's cynically bodychecked. That's a yellow card for the Croat.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Benayoun is hacked down 30 yards out. Gerrard takes the free kick and goes for the top right, but it's a weak effort and easily snaffled by Espinosa. Liege go straight down the other end and nearly score, Dalmat fizzing a shot across the face of Reina's goal from the right.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Standard Liege 0-0 Liverpool.</strong> Well, Liverpool got away with that. Very poor from last year's semi-finalists, although Standard Liege were impressive and very unlucky not to score at least a couple. Much improvement will be needed by Liverpool in a couple of weeks at Anfield, or it's the Uefa Cup for Rafa.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Chicago. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Anni Rossi (vocals, viola). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> There's a lot to say about Anni Rossi. She's been working with Steve Albini on her debut album proper, slated for release on 4AD in 2009. She's recorded a version of Radiohead's Creep that turns the self-loathing of the original inside out and upside down. She's loved by other artists like Electrelane and the Ting Tings, with whom she's toured Europe and the States. And she's apparently popular not just with artsy boho types, but with American heartland blue-collar construction workers, who think she's a cross between PJ Harvey and Paula Abdul. </p> <p>And yet it's hard to know how to describe her. \"Avant-folkie\" sort of comes close, as does \"neo-classical singer-songwriter with quirky voice\". Luckily, the 22-year-old from Minnesota via Los Angeles has her own neat tag for who she is and what she does: \"I'm a classical kid, turned viola-pop wunderkind\", she says. So there you have it. For further idea of what to expect from her 4AD debut EP, Afton, imagine if Bj\u00f6rk had been captured after leaving the Sugarcubes and locked in a darkened room with the viola player from the Brodksy Quartet. Rossi is that viola player.</p> <p>Classically trained from a young age, she started out as a violinist before opting for its \"lower register and larger-framed cousin\". Now she plucks the poor thing with manic glee while whooping and shrieking like a hyped-up pixie. This is music for singing round <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna\">the old Joanna</a> - or maybe that should be Joanna Newsom? Rossi is like Newsom's kid sister. Or perhaps Devendra Banhart's brattish, precocious younger cousin. You'll either find her winningly girly and intoxicating, or irritating in her smug idiosyncratic strangeness. <br> On Machine, the opening track on Afton, she eeks and grrs to denote joy unbound while the lyrics express a general wonderment at ice, snow, the natural world, and if that doesn't merit the epithet \"Bj\u00f6rkesque\", we don't know what does. Most of Rossi's songs are sparse and spare, the spaces in the music filled by her panoply of vocal tics and imagistic imaginings. On Arctic Swing, for example, she longs to be a beekeeper's daughter in the Himalayas. Where Machine finds her \"swinging crazily like a stock exchange\", Ecology is the closest she comes to a pop song, albeit an eccentric little one (it's 1:46 short, with guitar, woodwind, percussion and a driving beat). It sees her marvelling at caterpillars, her discovery that they're \"concentric\" eliciting a series of raar!s, hah!s and shriek!s. On Venice, she alternates between long drawn-out moans and sharp ecstatic sighs before countering the classical viola runs that close the piece with a bizarre impression of a motorboat. Like we say, you're either going to love her or be filled with homicidal fury at her every gasp, wail and chirrup.</p> <p> <br><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Her singular squeak might be one shattered champagne flute too many.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Considering how idiosyncratic she is, Rossi sounds oddly familiar.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make you violently happy or angry.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Make you want to learn the viola.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The Afton EP is released by 4AD on October 20.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Liz Green, Florence &amp; The Machine, Mechanical Bride, Joanna Newsom. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/annirossi\">MySpace.com/annirossi</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Rod Thomas</p>",
  "<p>At least 18 people were killed today in the north Lebanese city of Tripoli after a bomb exploded near a bus carrying civilians and soldiers, according to security officials. </p> <p>They said the bomb was planted on the side of a road and detonated at the busiest time of the morning as commuters headed to work.</p> <p>Nine soldiers were among the dead and at least another 45 people were wounded. TV footage showed a small bus wrecked by the blast in the centre of the north Lebanese city.</p> <p>Witnesses said fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene, while soldiers and policemen cordoned off the area to investigate. </p> <p>No one claimed responsibility immediately after the attack. \"The army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorise them with attacks and crimes,\" said President Michel Suleiman, who had been army chief until his election in May. </p> <p>Tripoli is Lebanon's second largest city with a mostly Sunni Muslim population. It has witnessed sectarian clashes between Sunni fighters and followers of the Alawite sect, an off-shoot Shia sect, in the past few weeks, that has killed and wounded dozens of people.</p> <p>The city is also close to the Palestinian refugee camp of Nahr el-Bared, which experienced violent clashes last year between Lebanese troops and members of the al-Qaida-inspired Fatah Islam group. Hundreds were killed before the militants were defeated.</p> <p>Fatah Islam claimed responsibility for a bomb blast that killed a soldier in Abdeh, near Tripoli, on May 31. The latest violence comes at an especially sensitive time for Lebanon.</p> <p>Yesterday, after a five-day debate and weeks of negotiations that preceded it, the Lebanese parliament approved a national unity government that gave the Iranian-backed Hizbullah opposition a more powerful say in the running of the country, including veto power over major decisions.</p> <p>The explosion in Tripoli came as President Suleiman embarked on a landmark visit to neighbouring Syria \u2014 the first visit by a Lebanese president in about three years.</p>",

  "<p>In July 1841, the poet John Clare, incarcerated in an asylum at Epping Forest for four years, discharged himself and decided to walk home. Home was in Northamptonshire, 80 miles away, and his expedition \u2013 sleeping in ditches, eating grass by the roadside \u2013 took an excruciating three days to complete. That extraordinary journey is the map for Steve Waters' tender, wistful solo play, which traces the poet's footsteps through the strange terrain of five counties he would never see again.</p> <p>The exact landscape that Clare saw is, of course, all but gone. Waters' script, vividly delivered by Patrick Morris to the accompaniment of Denise Neapolitan's solo violin, is bleakly funny as it attempts to locate the poet's spirit in a baffling maze of suburbs and tarmac. From Epping, the playwright strikes out via Enfield, all menacing estates and BNP posters, along the grimly named London-Peterborough Growth Corridor, towards St Neots and Stilton. He downs pints of London Pride with the folk from the Campaign for Rural England, glimpses a buzzard in the woods further down the trail. Trapped inside the air-conditioned glass of the Howard mall at Welwyn Garden City, he cruises past Millie's Cookies and Topshop as The Girl from Ipanema plays disconsolately.</p> <p>There's something Iain Sinclairish about the project (Sinclair has indeed written about Clare's walk), but the most likeable thing about this modest little piece is its refusal to preach, whether about England's lost greenery or the identikit landscape that has replaced it. Morris is an entertaining and watchable guide, gamely standing in for the host of rural campaigners, farmers and civil engineers he meets en route - even, at one mildly ill-advised moment, impersonating an endangered tree. He dons waistcoat, scarf and boots at the play's end to bring the poet to life.</p> <p>Embroidered with remembrances half-recovered and longings half-told, and coloured by the awestruck lyricism of Clare's verse, Out of Your Knowledge suggests that the journeys we take are often deep into ourselves.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz published what seemed like a significant development in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, reporting that PM Ehud Olmert had presented Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president \"with a detailed <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1010812.html\">proposal</a> for an agreement in principle on borders, refugees and security arrangements between Israel and a future Palestinian state\".</p> <p>The \"offer\" is nothing too different to what we've seen before: Israel keeps the main settlement blocs, including around Jerusalem, Gush Etzion, Maaleh Adumim, and, the Ha'aretz article suggests, Efrat and Ariel too. There is no mention of arrangements for the <a href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article9573.shtml\">Jordan valley</a>, crucial territory that Olmert has previously declared his intention to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/08/israel\">annex</a>.</p> <p>While Israel apparently keeps 7% of the West Bank, the Palestinians are \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast\">compensated</a>\" with land from the Negev desert and a road connecting the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In fact, the overall borders are by and large determined by the separation wall, which the report rightly notes has created a \"new physical reality\".</p> <p>The Palestinian state would be \"demilitarised\", the question of Jerusalem is postponed, and there is \"a detailed and complex formula for solving the refugee problem\" that does not (it would seem) include even a recognition of Israeli responsibility. But while the details are familiar, and from a Palestinian point of view, a joke, what's more interesting is the way in which the package is presented as a \"shelf agreement\".</p> <p>What that basically means is that Israel does not actually need to do anything substantive until \"the Palestinians complete a series of internal reforms and are capable of carrying out the entire agreement\". Indeed, Israel would immediately annex the illegal colonies, but the strip of desert and Gaza-West Bank connecting road would not be \"delivered\" to the Palestinians until \"the PA [Palestinian Authority] retakes control of the Gaza Strip\". </p> <p>All of which means that the proposal looks like it has been designed to never actually be implemented. Moreover, the Ha'aretz article reads at times more like a sales pitch, as the reader is assured that Olmert \"feels there is time to reach an agreement during his remaining time in office\" and is \"now awaiting a decision from the Palestinians\" \u2013 who, it was claimed, have already been given maps of the proposed borders.</p> <p>The Palestinian response was swift. Abbas spokesperson Nabil Abu Rdainah denounced the plan as an unacceptable \"waste of time\" and demonstrating a \"lack of seriousness\". Emphasising that the Palestinians will only accept a state on the 1967 boundaries, \"free of settlements\", Abu Rdainah also <a href=\"http://maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;ID=31249\">accused</a> Israel of trying to \"escape the idea of two states\".</p> <p>Later, veteran Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that the report was \"<a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iA5_KA-boHhmfrxdJ9usJw8HQdzg\">baseless</a>\", mere \"'half-truths\" that Israel was using \"as a test balloon so they can blame the Palestinian Authority should the negotiations fail\". From the Gaza Strip, <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/12/content_9221159.htm\">Hamas</a> also reacted to the breaking story, with their spokesperson describing the proposal as \"only a media report\", which if true, was intended to encourage further PA-Hamas confrontations, by linking any agreement to Abbas \"retrieving\" Gaza.</p> <p>The Palestinian response was as fast as it was dismissive, a decision taken by people keenly aware that there can be no repeat of Israel and the US's Camp David PR triumph; the Palestinians won't (even unjustly) be able to receive the blame for peace talks collapsing this time around. </p> <p>It is in this context that the comments by <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1010210.html\">Ahmed Qureia</a> on Sunday about the \"one-state solution\" should be understood. The senior negotiator and ex-prime minister declared that if Israel continued to prevent the realisation of a Palestinian state in the Occupied Territories, \"then the Palestinian demand \u2026 [would be] one state, a binational state\". </p> <p>It is what one journalist referred to as \"<a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/article/20080811/FOREIGN/5715175/1042/rss&amp;profile=1042\">the binational weapon</a>\", a threat, or, perhaps \"a bargaining gambit\" during a critical stage in the talks. However, it is likely to be not so much the appliance of leverage, but rather an indication that the game is up; it could even be \"prophetic\".</p> <p>Taking a step back, as senior Palestinians discuss <a href=\"http://newstatesman.com/society/2008/08/palestinian-israel-palestine\">unilateral measures</a> and shifts in strategy, and as Olmert prepares to leave office, the Ha'aretz report appears like the Israeli government's own attempt at damage limitation. The newspaper itself even cited an anonymous Israeli official who confirmed that \"there is going to be no agreement, period\" (an understanding shared by the <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1010931.html\">settlers</a>).</p> <p>Last week, Jamal Zakout, advisor to Palestinian PM, Salam Fayyad, stressed repeatedly the extent to which the two-state solution was being \"endangered\". He also said that should there be no deal in 2008, and if the peace process fails, \"This time no one can say the Palestinians are to be blamed\".

Christian Bale as Christopher Nolan's Batman</p> <p>There's been plenty of discussion already on this blog about what would have happened <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/film/2008/07/chris_nolan_vs_darren_aronofsk.html\">if Darren Aronofsky had got his hands on the Batman franchise</a> instead of Christopher Nolan, not to mention <a href=\"http://my.spill.com/profiles/blog/show?id=947994%3ABlogPost%3A355506\">The Spill.com's brilliant spoof Michael Bay script</a>.</p> <p>In the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/11/3\">The Dark Knight's phenomenal success</a>, the latest film-maker to reveal that he was in with a shout to direct what became Batman Begins three years ago is Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)\">the excellent sci-fi series Firefly</a> (almost certainly the greatest TV show in the genre of all time for those who haven't yet checked it out) and its equally cool big screen outing, Serenity.</p> <p>Whedon says he spoke to Warner Bros about taking on the caped crusader franchise before Nolan began work, and maintains his take was similar in tone to the film which eventually hit cinema screens. It was, however, \"a bit less epic\" and kept the action focused on Gotham city.</p> <p>\"He didn't go to Tibet and meet cool people, but it was very similar in vibe,\" <a href=\"http://splashpage.mtv.com/2008/08/11/joss-whedon-talks-about-his-batman-movie-that-never-was/\">Whedon told MTV</a>. \"In my version, there was actually a new [villain], it wasn't one of the classics - which is probably why they didn't use it. It was more of a Hannibal Lecter type - he was somebody already in Arkham Asylum that Bruce went and sort of studied with.</p> <p>\"It was a whole thing - I get very emotional about it, I still love the story. Maybe I'll get to do it as a comic one day.\"</p> <p>I love what Nolan has done with Batman, but there's a part of me that yearns to see what Whedon, a huge comic book fan who was worked regularly in the discipline, writing a large number of titles for Dark Horse and Marvel, could have done with the character. Whedon was also attached to write and direct Wonder Woman for Warner, but pulled out over budget disagreements last year.</p> <p>One hopes that all is not quite lost, as given the current, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/film/2008/08/for_editors_the_view_the_geeks.html\">ever-expanding Hollywood appetite for comic book adaptations</a> in the wake of the Dark Knight, it only seems a matter of time before the best qualified film-maker in the business gets a crack at one of the larger titles. Which character would you like to see Whedon take on?</p>",
  "<p>German police have detained two men in connection with an attack at an ice cream parlour that left three people dead and another seriously injured. </p> <p>A gang of up to five assailants attacked another group at the cafe with knives and guns. At least four people were seen fleeing from the cafe in the pedestrianised area of Ruesselsheim, south-west of Frankfurt, at about 8pm last night. </p> <p>A 29-year-old Turkish man seated at a table in the caf\u00e9 died at the scene. One of the attackers, a 26-year-old Turk, was one of those killed and his 32-year-old brother was badly wounded. He is under police guard in hospital. </p> <p>A 55-year-old Greek woman, owner of a nearby restaurant, was caught in the crossfire and fatally wounded after being shot in the stomach. <br>A manhunt using dogs and helicopters was launched and two Turkish men have been taken in to custody. </p> <p>Police spokesman Stefan Mueller said the motive for the attack was probably a personal dispute and there had already been trouble between two of the people involved in a nearby town at the weekend. Local media reports have suggested the attack might have been linked to betting debts. </p> <p>As several assailants are still at large, police have warned further clashes are possible. </p> <p>The case has resurrected memories of another multiple shooting in Germany almost exactly one year ago. Six people were shot dead in Duisburg, north-west of Frankfurt, in an attack that may have been connected to a long-running feud between Italian mafia clans.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\"Famously \u2013 well, famously in Wolverhampton anyway \u2013 Wolves failed to secure any cut of subsequent transfer fees paid for Robbie Keane when they sold him to Coventry,\"</strong> lamented Kevin Porter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/30/1\">a couple of weeks ago</a>. <strong>\"As Robbie has featured in yet another multi-million pound transfer, this typically Molineuxesque incompetence has lost the club a sizeable chunk of income. But which lower-league team has been most astute in the sell-on practise?\"</strong></p> <p>There were some stern words for Mr Porter, with Dan Lavelle pointing out that sell-on fees only apply for the \"first subsequent transfer immediately following the clause being drawn up, not for all future revenues for the rest of the player's career\". By his reckoning, the \u00a37m profit Coventry made on Keane when they sold him to Internazionale would only have netted Wolves a further \u00a3700,000 on top of the \u00a36m Coventry coughed up back in 1999. </p> <p>But a lost \u00a3700,000 is still \u00a3700,000 lost. By common consent, first in the queue to rub salt into Wolves' festering open wound is former Newcastle and Spurs striker Les Ferdinand. When Ferdinand moved to Newcastle from QPR for \u00a36m, Hayes received a very tasty \u00a3600,000 as a result of a 10% sell-on clause. This was a fee \"six hundred times greater than our record outlay on a player\", crows Karl Fonseca. And adding insult to injury, James Ryder pointed out that Hayes (now Hayes and Yeading United FC) have even immortalised the deal by building a function room named the Ferdinand Suite. </p> <p>Stan Collymore also gets an honourable mention. Savvy Southend added an extra \u00a31.5m in performance-related bonuses on top of the already hefty \u00a31.5m fee the club banked when he joined Nottingham Forest. \"We paid \u00a3500,000 if he scored 25 goals, another \u00a3500,000 when he scored 50 goals (or it might have been appearances) and yet another \u00a3500,000 if he played for England,\" half-remembers David Furse. \"Going in to the last day of the first season, Forest were promoted and Stanley was on the bench stuck on 24 goals. For some unknown reason Frank Clark sent him on with 20 minutes to go and within a minute or two, he'd scored and cost the club another half a million. The second installment came and went but I believe after his second season with Forest, which was also his last, he was called up to the England squad and played, only to be sold to Liverpool a week or two later, another half-million paid out for nowt.\"</p> <p>But Wolves are not the only club to make a hash of a sale. David Ede wrote in empathy with Wolves' plight, as he is still anguished by Chesterfield's failure to negotiate a sell-on fee that would have doubled their money for Kevin Davies. Southampton signed the burly striker for \u00a3750,000 in the aftermath of The Spireites' amazing 1996-97 FA Cup run and, after a successful first season on the south coast, sold Davies to Blackburn Rovers for \u00a37.5m a year later. Ouch.</p> <p><strong>OLD PROS DO IT BY THE BOOK</strong></p> <p><strong>\"I was wondering who is the oldest player ever to turn pro?\"</strong> asks Gus Worth. <strong>\"I remember Tony Book being something like 29 when he signed for Manchester City but he may have been a pro in non-league football before that.\"</strong></p> <p>Book was 31 when he arrived at Malcolm Allinson's Manchester City from Bath City, but he is not the oldest player to turn pro in the Football League.</p> <p>We begin with Accrington Stanley's Paul Mullin. \"Paul first played for us in 1995 as a 21-year-old when we were a Northern Premier League club, and came back to us at the same level in 2000,\" says Phil Whalley, \"The club turned professional for the 2004/05 season, when Paul was 30. He made his Football League debut in August 2006, aged 32. So far, he's played 411 games for Stanley (a club record) and scored 186 goals.\" Not just an oldie but a goodie, Mullin turned down a move to Shrewsbury last season to see his career out at the Fraser Eagle Stadium. \"He's a thoroughly decent lad,\" says Whalley. \"We couldn't hold him in any higher regard.\" </p> <p>George Young says that Paul Wilson, the erstwhile Scunthorpe United youth team coach, played his first (and last) professional game in the 1997/98 season at the age of 37. \"I believe that made him the oldest professional debutant since the war,\" asserts Young, \"I can't remember the circumstances behind him playing - at Cardiff, if memory serves - but no doubt it was due to a wafer-thin squad.\"</p> <p>Michael Haughey, meanwhile, has no answers but suggests the subject might require some further digging. \"When clubs had to be voted in to the league, players had to decide whether to give up their day jobs and go full time,\" he writes. \"This happened to a relative, Mick Worswick, who was in his mid-30s in 1978 when Wigan joined the league but who had a job with much better pay and prospects than Fourth Division wages. I would guess this era would be where the oldest player to turn pro would be found - or perhaps when professionalism was introduced in 1882.\"</p> <p>Something of a Knowledge work in progress, then \u2013 so if any Victorian football experts want to get in touch \u2026</p> <p><strong>THIS TOWN AIN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE (2)</strong></p> <p>Previously we have said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/30/1\">Minsk was the largest city in Europe never to make it into the Champions League</a> but, as Ali Olay from Istanbul pointed out, Ankara in Turkey really deserves that title: \"Geographically it's in Asia, and it's only relatively recently been designated a capital city, but it is around three times larger than the Belarusian capital and, while Genclerbirligi have played in the Uefa Cup, a Champions League place has so far eluded them and arch-rivals Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc.\" </p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>\"After Steve Claridge's stunningly-short stint in charge of Millwall, do you know of any other managers to lose their jobs without taking charge of a single competitive game?\"</strong> queried Ken Power in 2005.</p> <p>While Scunthorpe manager Bill Lambton 'boasts' the shortest spell in charge of a club (three days, though he never signed a contract), he did at least get to manage for one game - a 3-0 defeat to Huddersfield. Dave Bassett was announced as Crystal Palace's new manager in 1984, but, again before he'd signed a contract, was turned around on his heels four days later.</p> <p>But for under-contract managers failing to oversee a single, competitive game, we need look no further than Jose Camacho and his first spell at Real Madrid. In the summer of 1998, having been hired by president Lorenzo Sanz, Camacho swiftly fell out with the top man. There were rows over a contract for fitness trainer Carlos Lorenzana and then over Sanz's involvement in player affairs. Just 23 days after arriving at the Bernab\u00e9u, Camacho was out on his ear, only to return for another ill-fated spell at the club in 2004.</p> <p>Across the border in Portgual, Luigi del Neri joined this dubious list as Porto basked in the afterglow of their Champions League victory last year. Presented to the world as Jose Mourinho's successor on June 4, by August 9 he had been dumped by club president Jorge Pinto da Costa for poor time-keeping; an extended three-day absence from training being the final straw.

Well, like it or not, Beijing has put on one of the most memorable ceremonies any of us have ever seen,\" wrote the 6pm bulletin's output editor, Katy Searle, on the BBC blog.</p> <p>ITV led its Friday news bulletins with breaking news of the war on Europe's south-eastern boarder with Asia and the ITV News editor-in-chief, David Mannion, said he believed the BBC had made a mistake with the running order of its 6pm bulletin that day.</p> <p>\"It was an aberration.

  "<p>A convoy of three buses and an escort of armed Russian Special Forces soldiers travelled across the border with Russia into South Ossetia yesterday, in a trip organised by the Kremlin for foreign media to witness first hand the destruction in Tskhinvali.</p> <p>At the village of Dzhava 20 miles beyond the border a huge queue of Russian military hardware stood pointing south, testament to the might of the resurgent Russian state. </p> <p>Several truck-mounted rocket launchers were a sign of Moscow's intent to hold Tskhinvali at all costs. Approaching Tskhinvali, the group of reporters was transferred to armoured personnel carriers because of the risk of fire from Georgian snipers, said the Russian officers leading the trip. </p> <p>In villages close to the city there were many burned out houses, and others were still ablaze. In the city itself it was clear that claims the city had been levelled to the ground by artillery were exaggerated. However, it was also evident that while some neighbourhoods were intact, there were patches of terrible destruction. </p> <p>At a crossroads in the north of the city there was evidence of a fierce fire fight. Three destroyed Georgian tanks were slewed across the road, a mess of ash and twisted metal. The heavy turret of one tank had been tossed across the street, falling through a shop front. Nearby on the ground lay a human foot. </p> <p>Colonel Igor Konashenko of the Russian army said: \"There were Georgian attacks overnight but our troops are in full control of the city. So far we've had no orders to move south into Georgia.\"</p> <p>Hearing of a ceasefire yesterday, civilians began to emerge from bunkers and basements. At the crossroads, Izolda Deppiyeva, 50, looked out on the scene of ruined ground floor apartment in a block riddled by gunfire. She recalled the moment when Georgian artillery first hit the city. </p> <p>\"There was a great wave of pressure which twisted me and flung me against the kitchen wall.\"</p> <p>A former theatre stage actress, Deppiyeva said she had lived for four days in a cellar with her relatives without food and water.</p> <p>\"I could not leave,\" she said. \"This land is my body, my home. We are a proud beautiful people and we are not leaving. I survived, I am alive!\" </p> <p>In the yard behind the apartment block a group of Ossetian fighters were seated at a wooden bench eating mutton and drinking wine: \"We are raising a toast to those who are left,\" said Ruslan Kostoyev, 33. \"Those tanks in the street, we hit them with rocket propelled grenades from the basement.\" </p> <p>Kostoyev accused Western leading countries of arming Georgia in the conflict: \"A Georgian only knows how to ride a cow,\" he said, \"the aeroplanes which destroyed the building were Ukrainian,\" he said. </p> <p>Another fighter said: \"The Georgians were 30 times stronger than us. They wanted to kill us to destroy everything. But we held them off.\" </p> <p>Outside in the street, a priest in an immaculate black cassock walked through the scene of devastation. Saurmag Bazzate, an Ossetian prior, arrived in Tskhinvali on Monday. \"I came to be with my people,\" he said. \"Those who perpetrated this horror are criminals who must be punished by God. This war is a result of Georgian fascism, which has flourished with the support of the West.\" </p> <p>Russian officials in the city say their main aim is now to contain a humanitarian disaster by repairing water supplies insuring that bread factories are working and re-establishing an electricity supply. </p> <p>Close to the centre of the city Russian officers led the group to the city's main hospital which was hit by small arms fire and shells during the first days of fighting. Doctors at the hospital said they had been forced to carry out operations in corridors and the basement of the building without electricity, water or light. </p> <p>Tina Zakharova, one of the doctors, pointed out chunks of shrapnel which had hit the building. </p> <p>\"This is the humanitarian aid that Georgia sent us,\" she said, \"and that,\" she said, pointing at a field hospital nearby, \"is the help we received from Russia. Which do you think we should chose?\" She added: \"I've never heard anything so monstrous as people shelling a hospital.\" </p> <p>In total, said Zakharova, 224 injured people had been treated at the hospital and two people had died there. Just south of the city centre a group of reporters were shown a street entirely destroyed by a Grad missile attack. Homes along the 100m street had been reduced to rubble. </p> <p>One man showed the Guardian the metal casing of a Grad rocket lodged in the ruins of his home: \"We managed to escape to the shelter just in time,\" he said, pointing at the mouth of a cellar protected by huge chunks of concrete. </p> <p>Colonel Konashenko said: \"The Georgians could not get tanks through these narrow streets. So first they turned it to ruins with a Grad attack and tried to punch through here to the centre of the city. There was heavy fighting in the streets. I think more than 500 bodies were pulled out of this part of town.\" </p> <p>Asked if there had been atrocities against civilians the Colonel replied: \"I personally saw one man beheaded lying in the street and others say they witnessed civilians who had been finished off with a shot to the back of the head.\"</p> <p>Back at the hospital there were sounds of gunfire and then the crump of mortars landing somewhere in the city. First one explosion, then a second. When a third hit, sounding louder, the Colonel said: \"It's time to move. Let's go.\"</p>"
