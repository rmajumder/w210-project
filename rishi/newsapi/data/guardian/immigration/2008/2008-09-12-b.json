  "<p>A tower which has haunted the imagination of artists and writers for thousands of years will rise again in the first exhibition devoted to the art, archaeology and dreams of ancient Babylon.</p> <p>\"When we asked people about Babylon many weren't quite sure whether it was a real place or a kind of fairytale, but what they had heard of was the Tower of Babel and the Hanging Gardens,\" said Irving Finkel, curator of the British Museum exhibition. \"We have lavish evidence for one and not a scrap for the other, but we'll do our best.\"</p> <p>The exhibition will recreate a lost city renowned for its engineers and mathematicians but also for its magicians and dream interpreters, with displays including brilliantly-coloured tile panels of lions and dragons taken from the great processional way towards the towering Ishtar gate. </p> <p>The ancient city drew scholars from all over the world: the exhibition will show that the captured Jews may have sat down and wept by the waters of Babylon after the sack of Jerusalem - but after they were freed, many chose not to go home.</p> <p>Although versions of the exhibition have been seen in Berlin and Paris, the British Museum's will be the first to bring together archaeological evidence with contemporary artworks and Old Masters, as well as photographs showing the damage done in the current Iraq war when the ancient city became an American tank park.</p> <p>The Old Testament Tower of Babel, supposedly toppled by a God affronted by human arrogance, was the city's great step pyramid ziggurat, then the tallest building in the world. Nothing remains of the structure except a water-filled square ditch. As well as a model based on recent archaeological evidence, the exhibition assembles works showing how it loomed in the imagination of artists such as D\u00fcrer and Blake, right up to a haunting piece by Michael Lassel showing a tower of asylum seekers' shoes.</p> <p>The Hanging Gardens are trickier: the story is they were a lushly planted artificial hill, built for a queen yearning for the green mountains of her homeland. Centuries of archaeologists have hunted for the gardens and found nothing.</p> <p>\"But they did have gardens, and they certainly had the engineering skills to make water flow uphill - the tradition of the gardens in early Greek sources is so strong and so consistent I have no doubt they really existed,\" Finkel said.</p> <p>However the best evidence he can offer is one of the museum's priceless clay tablets with cuneiform script - a planting list from a Babylonian king's garden, which includes onions, shallots and garlic. \"The hanging green salad of Babylon,\" Finkel said. \"Very nice too.\"</p>",
  "<p>Here we have a well-trodden travel motif taken to its ultimate conclusion: a writer following in his own footsteps. More than 30 years ago, the American author Paul Theroux looped on a series of trains from London to the farthest reaches of Asia and back. His 1981 account of that journey, The Great Railway Bazaar, became an international bestseller. It was the book that made him and launched fleets of other people's travel books. In this new tome, Theroux repeats the experience.</p> <p>Geopolitics alter the route: the author is refused a visa into Iran, avoids Afghanistan, and so on. Beginning again in London, he takes to the rails through central Europe and Turkey, continuing across various central Asian republics, India, southeast Asia and Japan. Choosing to avoid China, as he loathes the thought of its \"honking\" greed for development, he flies from Niigata to Vladivostok, and from there rattles back over Russia on the Trans-Siberian Express. </p> <p>Theroux likes Istanbul (\"a city with the soul of a village\") and swoons at the Asiatic glamour of Hanoi, which he visits here for the first time, though the stories he hears from witnesses of the 1972 Christmas bombing are among the most harrowing in the book. But on the whole he hates cities and yearns for the wilderness, like his hero Thoreau. \"In Tokyo,\" he observes, \"everyone looks as though they'd all received the same memo: Walk fast and look worried\"; whereas the snow-covered emptiness of northern Hokkaido is \"the landscape of my dreams\". India (87 pages) and Japan (56 pages) receive the most attention, but as in his best travel books (The Old Patagonian Express, for example, and the African odyssey Dark Star Safari), the brilliance lies in the author's ability to create a broad sweep of many countries - a sequence of close-up shots that form a semi-global panorama.</p> <p>There are no historical tracts. Mostly, the book describes the author's personal responses while nothing much happens. We see him eating, reading and doing crosswords, visiting the dentist or having a haircut. He gets drunk a lot less than he did in Bazaar, and gets up earlier. Occasionally he interviews or meets up with other celebrated authors: Orhan Pamuk in Turkey, Haruki Murakami in Tokyo and the late Arthur C Clarke in Sri Lanka, the latter wearing a T-shirt saying, \"I invented the satellite and all I got was this lousy T-shirt\". The interaction with Murakami (who translated Theroux's novel World's End) is the longest and most revealing, but in the end the luminaries play walk-on roles: the stars are the rickshaw wallah, the monk in the next seat, the exhausted prostitute. Theroux allows them to speak for themselves. Although he visits a few ancient sites - Merv, for example, in the Karakum wasteland - it is people who compel Theroux. Never seduced by propaganda, he recognises that it is the man at the bottom of the heap who tells the truest truth about his land. Anyway, he is far too accomplished a writer to need glittering set-pieces. </p> <p>Some places have changed, some have stayed the same, others have gone backwards. Joginder's greasy caf\u00e9 and pastry shop has become Joginder's greasy internet caf\u00e9 and pastry shop. Bangalore, \"sleepy and bungaloidal\" on Theroux's last visit, has become the driver of the fabled \"Indian economic miracle\". Visiting the call centres in which Indians advise Californians on problems with their cellphones, the author is sceptical of a miracle that leaves 400 million people below the poverty line. Burma almost breaks his heart. His description of Cambodia almost broke mine. As Theroux observes, the existence of museums of Khmer Rouge horrors suggests that Cambodia has reformed, which is not true. </p> <p>He puts the boot into the Chinese leadership and notes ruefully that, on the whole 28,000-mile trip, he met two people who support George Bush. But he encounters little personal hostility. Most ordinary people are good, Theroux concludes in his last paragraph, and that gives him hope. Perhaps that is why he prefers the simple lodging to the palazzo. \"Luxury is the enemy of observation,\" he notes, a demoralising revelation. But luxury is not his instinct. \"At the sight of all this filth and disorder,\" he writes on discovering the restaurant car on the express to Bucharest, \"my spirits rose.\" He likes to see \"countries with their trousers down\", and when told that Wakkanai is boring, he responds: \"Sounds like my kind of place.\"</p> <p>As always, he is omnipresent in the narrative - a signature of his style. It is the opposite of that other master, Norman Lewis, who appears in his travel books only as an agent of the material. Fortunately for the reader, Theroux has the gift of self-awareness. \"In some well-hidden part of the traveller's personality,\" he surmises, \"is an unpickable knot of vanity, presumption and mythomania bordering on the pathological.\" Travel writing he calls \"the lowest form of literary self-indulgence\". In Vientiane, an English backpacker assumes Theroux must long to be Michael Palin. Imagine Chatwin admitting that.</p> <p>Theroux refers to the trip as \"a sentimental journey\", and he shares Sterne's delight in the sad absurdities of life. He can be tender. The emotional climax of Ghost Train unfolds halfway through, at Candacraig, the Raj \"chummery\" in Burma where single men from the army or civil service used to take leave. In Bazaar Theroux wrote lovingly of the chief steward there, and on the return visit is embraced by the man's elderly children. In the perfumed rooms of Candacraig he experienced \"the past recaptured, like a refuge . . . it was the sort of reunion I had hoped for when I set out to repeat my trip\". Then he reflects touchingly: \"Nothing like this had ever happened to me among my own family.\"</p> <p>Theroux is a fabulously good writer with an almost perfect ear for the rhythm of his prose. \"The century-old station at Haydarpasa,\" chapter 4 begins, \"was floodlit and looked like an opera house on the night I crossed the Bosporus to take the night express to Ankara.\" He has not lost his touch when it comes to conjuring topography. The sun rises in Bucharest \"like a coddled egg\", Turkish roads have a \"somnolent nobility\", and his passage on the ripened, feathery cycads and tall old palms of Sinhalese gardens is magisterial. Like everything Theroux writes (to date 27 works of fiction and 15 of non-fiction), Ghost Train is agreeably spiced with literary references, mostly from the usual crew - Yeats, Conrad, Larkin - though he takes trouble to involve lesser-known indigenous writers, too. </p> <p>It turns out that Theroux was miserable the whole time on the first trip (\"though I made the book jolly\") because his wife had taken a lover; he makes a meal here of the fact that he threatened to kill both her and her boyfriend. He reveals that he re-ordered facts to suit the prose: for example, whereas he actually met an important character in Bazaar in a guesthouse, he pretended that he encountered him on the train \"because I wanted to give my trip some drama\". All travel writers do that, but most can't admit it. And why should the reader care? It's art, not life.</p> <p>\"The greatest difference,\" Theroux writes when comparing the two journeys, \"was in me. I had survived the long road that leads to the present.\" When he set out for the second time he was twice the age of the person who wrote Bazaar. He acknowledges lower expectations, a contempt for political promises, and - crucially, I think, for the creative imagination - the fact that \"after a certain age the traveller stops looking for another life\". Elegiac acceptance informs the tone of every line of this book. Its author is a happier man now, and one who moans a lot less, but, more significantly for the narrative, he is also an older one.</p> <p>Funny, informative and lyrical, this is a portrait of half the world in light and shade by a writer who still cannot be challenged in the field he reinvented. Although I loved The Great Railway Bazaar, I love Ghost Train to the Eastern Star more - and that, of course, is because I am older too.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sara Wheeler's Too Close to the Sun: The Life and Times of Denys Finch Hatton is published by Vintage</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday September 23 2008.

  "<p>Davina Gounden is completing her master's degree in migration studies at Queen Mary, University of London and she is keen to work for an international organisation. \"My first degree was very general, so I wanted to study something that was more specific,\" she explains. \"I did my undergraduate dissertation on immigration in France and found it very interesting, so I wanted to keep studying that. The course covers everything from theories of migration to the simple facts of just why you get movements of people from different countries.\" She is also trilingual and enthusiastic about working in different places. \"I can speak English, French and Spanish,\" she says. \"Working abroad wouldn't be a problem for me at all.\"</p> <p>We asked Amelia Bookstein Kyazze, head of humanitarian policy at Save The Children UK, to mock-interview Gounden for an entry-level job. Then we asked her what she thought. </p> <p>\"Save The Children is one of the largest humanitarian and development organisations in the world,\" she explains. \"We work in about 100 countries doing rapid response or development work, all based on the framework of children's rights.\"</p> <p>Bookstein Kyazze explains that her team works on a variety of projects. \"It can be very fast, responding to disasters,\" she says, \"or working on slow onset problems or long-term human rights abuses. We work out how to research and work with the media and with policy makers, and we translate that into communications with governments, the UN, our supporters and the press.\" She emphasises that people she works with need to be able to recognise opportunities and risks quickly, and be able to think strategically. \"You need a good idea of what is going on in the world,\" she says, \"to be able to pull ideas together.</p> <p>\"We're definitely looking for problem solvers, for people who can go into stressful situations and can operate in that environment, and people who are cheerful, that's always a good sign.\" She also looks for people who are knowledgeable about Save the Children. \"People who know why we're different and know about our campaigns,\" she says. </p> <p>Good communication skills, a positive approach and a willingness to think about the audience you're trying to reach are also key, as is enthusiasm. \"We're really ambitious here and you must want to be part of something big.\"</p> <p>Gounden came across well in the interview, says Bookstein Kyazze. \"She described herself as determined, and I think she probably is.\"</p> <p>The fact that Gounden speaks three languages is a \"huge asset\" says Bookstein Kyazze, \"but she needs to work on how she sells herself a bit more. It took us a while to find out that she'd volunteered at a children's charity and done work experience at the Mauritian embassy in Spain.\" </p> <p>Gounden also revealed an interest in relevant media. \"She was able to list all these documentaries she's seen and talk very well about them. That would be a real advantage in a media role, for example, and she seemed not to realise that it was unusual and good.\"</p> <p>Because of her academic background, Gounden's skills would also mean she was well placed for a research role. \"She should remember to always make a connection between her work and what we do,\" advises Bookstein Kyazze. </p> <p>Gounden found the interview a useful experience. \"I was a bit nervous,\" she says, \"but they were really nice, even though it was a formal interview.\" Most helpful to her was being interviewed by specialists in the same area as she had been studying. \"I've never had an interview with people so close to my own area of research before,\" she says, \"so it was really helpful to have an idea about the kind of questions I'll be asked in future interviews.\"</p> <p>If you are an undergraduate or recent graduate in need of a career blind date, send your CV to graduate@theguardian.com </p> <h2>Questions asked</h2> <p>\u00b7 What would you say are the most pressing humanitarian debates and issues today? </p> <p>\u00b7 What would the differences be between writing a master's degree and writing material for Save the Children?</p> <p>\u00b7 How familiar are you with production technologies?

  "<p>If the 19th century was about controlling the environment, then the 20th was about admitting how it controls us in return: \"One is not duchess / A hundred yards from a carriage,\" wrote Wallace Stevens, crystallising in a single line any number of cultural and sociological drives, from Leninism to linguistic relativity. Christopher Middleton, now in his 80s, whose early publishing career overlapped for a decade with Stevens's, is one of the few British poets to have kept exploring this Modernist territory right up to the present day, as his vast and inventive Collected Poems shows. \"I exalt a space ripening and continuous,\" he writes; and such spaces are not just physical, not just the interior of a house or the shape of a dress (he has a wonderful poem, \"Chanel Always Now\", on the rise of the fickle fashion industry), but imagined and spoken, too. </p> <p>This is perhaps to be expected from a linguist. Having spent his academic career at the University of Texas as a professor of modern languages, Middleton is well aware of the different worlds available to different tongues, and better equipped than most to resist his own centrality. The poems hardly ever come from a distinct poetic \"I\", but instead are turned outwards to explore the \"developable surfaces\" that lie all around. He models for us all manner of landscapes - Cornwall; Texas; a tussock moth's wings; shipyards; refugee camps; the interior of a nude photograph, where mystery is \"buttressed at one end by the puckered wall / of stone and plaster, at the other end / by the gaze exploring all without distress\". Seemingly untrammelled by his own nationality, Middleton's visions of Italy, Mexico and Russia are equally bold and convincing: \"at the valley's other end a slope of roofs / this maze long abandoned by the tinkling animals / old stone room inhaling all the winds\" (\"Petrarch's Country\").</p> <p>Environment leads, naturally enough, to ecology: Middleton has amassed many poems that might now retrospectively be folded into the emergent \"ecopoetry\". \"Old Woman at the County Dump\" describes someone who lives among \"All the stuff / people have left, beyond and behind, / marching toward a world of absolute deodorants, / infallible laxatives\", and would seem to prefigure Derek Mahon's better-known trash poems. Middleton is also drawn to obscure plants (opoponax), reptiles (the coral snake, the anti-basilisk) and insects, and merely by considering them intelligently, no hand-wringing whatsoever, makes plain how much they enrich our world. An early poem, \"The Greenfly\", which reads as freshly as if it were written yesterday, considers how the singularity of a greenfly on a train window makes it impossible to kill: \"Some evenings I squirt / Swarms of your kind with a reliable poison. / Here it may not be the same.\" The poem effortlessly reaches back, towards the battlefields of the second world war, as well as forwards into the future, where \"the killing\" will undoubtedly go on, without ever needing to explain itself. It is enough that the speaker is on a train; it is enough that we, too, want to protect our \"one or two roses\".</p> <p>Such a genteel, orderly piece, being just one facet of Middleton's talent, is inevitably followed by something more resistant. He experiments restlessly, provocatively, with allusion, quotation, typography, tone, only occasionally succumbing to the chaos that all experimental poets risk. His command of idioms, and the huge vocabulary at his fingertips, are quite astonishing; and by letting all fields of reference into his work - from poststructuralism to hick-talk - he offers us poetry equal to the world it depicts, but always with a radical undertow that saves it from being inertly permissive. \"Ballad of the Putrefaction\", from 1996's Intimate Chronicles, tells of an angry poet (referred to as \"himself\") and his plan to write a \"poem of hateful persons, / Nobodies governing nations without any sense of what's what\". Alongside the usual gripes about weapons deals, \"himself\" broods on the absurdity of power and the words in which it's formed:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>Typically one who ordered a total <br>change of trees<br>Resenting the way leaves tore loose<br>from a sycamore<br>Himself too mumbled how their<br>language formulaic and glib<br>Formulaic and numb and belittling<br>gave rhetoric a bad name<br>Mouse gray their claptrap squeaking<br>in machines</p> </blockquote> <p>Instead of lampooning the impulse to write a poem that will \"shine through air in the darkest places / So its voices will banish the fug they spread\", Middleton lets it speak for itself, in all its mad glory, and in doing so produces a poem more intelligent and moving than the intended protest rant could ever be.</p> <p>As well as revisiting collections as exciting as The Lonely Suppers of WV Balloon, anyone already familiar with Middleton's work will be pleased to find new poems here, especially the keenly piteous \"Chekhov at Sumy\": \"While he slept, / One lung, or both, might have whistled / So entertainingly, the light-winged / Dryads of the wood joined in.\" Perhaps there are times, in \"The Tenor on Horseback\" for example, where an enthusiasm for continental philosophy or theology can seem to overwhelm the structure in which it appears; but such occasional imbalances are a small price to pay for genuine metaphysical engagement. Anyone who wants to peer into the corners of the language, and who feels they're ready for a challenge, will find enough insight and innovation in this collection to keep them happy for years.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Frances Leviston's Public Dream is published by Picador.</p>",

  "<p>All ailing governments have an atmosphere. In the mid-1990s, John Major's slowly expired amid pinstriped rebellions by Eurosceptics and Tory sleaze stories in the papers. In the early 90s, Margaret Thatcher's sickened more suddenly as poll tax protesters rioted and Michael Heseltine quietly plotted. In the early 70s, Ted Heath's was stalked and then strangled by the National Union of Mineworkers.</p> <p>Yet British Labour governments - less common than Conservative ones, less tolerated by the press and, perhaps, by British society as a whole - can seem particularly doomed and melancholy in their final stages. Thirty years ago the then Labour prime minister Jim Callaghan took delivery of two new official cars. Callaghan was a highly patriotic premier, and British manufacturing was in need of a lift after the recession of the mid-70s; so the cars had been ordered from British Leyland, the state-owned car maker. But to many of his government's critics British Leyland's workmanship exemplified all that was unhealthy about the economy under Labour in the 70s. The cars, when they arrived, were found to have 34 mechanical faults between them.</p> <p>They were sent back, repaired and fitted with \u00a3250,000 of security features, a considerable outlay at the time, especially for Callaghan's administration. When the cars were finally ready, the prime minister was taken in one to an official engagement. On the way, he opened one of its electric windows for some air. The window fell in his lap. He lost power nine months later.</p> <p>This example of how accident-prone prime ministers can become when their fortunes turn downward comes from the diaries of Bernard Donoughue, Callaghan's senior policy adviser during his three years as premier. Downing Street Diary is in some ways an old-fashioned political book, fat and exhaustive as the many lunches it recalls at Old Labour's favourite restaurant, the Gay Hussar in Soho. Its busy, opinionated pages describe a compelling but vanished political world, of \"dangerous Trotskyites\" infiltrating the Labour party, and vast nationalised industries, and fraught loan negotiations between Britain and the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>Yet in other ways the diaries feel eerily current. They detail Callaghan's disastrous decision in 1978, seemingly so similar to Gordon Brown's last year, not to hold a general election during a surge of popularity for his government. They show ministers and advisers fixated by bad opinion polls. They feature a hungry new opposition leader who, whatever the government does, increasingly makes the political weather.</p> <p>\"I waited 30 years to publish, until everyone was off the stage,\" says Donoughue, a streetwise Westminster operator who since the 1970s has been a journalist, a City grandee, briefly a minister under Tony Blair, and is now a Labour peer. \"But you see lots of the same issues in the diaries that you see now: an energy crisis, public sector difficulties, trade unions being difficult. The present government is still not able to resolve many of the issues that were around in the 70s.\" </p> <p>Britain, Donoughue and his diaries imply, has not been reformed as completely since the 70s as later governments have liked to make out.</p> <p>Downing Street Diary also offers a vivid day-by-day account of how a government fails and what that feels like on the inside. In the beginning, however difficult a situation the new premier inherits, there is optimism. Callaghan became prime minister in 1976. Harold Wilson, the great showman of postwar Labour politics, had abruptly resigned after presiding ineffectually over Britain's worst economic downturn since the 1930s. A month into the new government, Donoughue could write admiringly: \"Jim has three layers: on the surface is Simple Honest Bluff Jim. Below that is a very cunning and secretive politician ... beneath that is somebody who does believe in the simple and honest virtues.\" When Brown replaced Blair last year, Donoughue felt that the same switch from flash to shrewdness was taking place: \"I thought, 'This is Callaghan after Wilson'.\" </p> <p>Callaghan, like Brown, immediately faced crises: out-of-control state spending, a weak economy, a vulnerable currency. And like Brown, at first he and his government appeared to relish them. Donoughue's diaries are full of dashes between meetings, and late-night sessions drawing up blueprints for national salvation. \"That was an appalling time,\" he says, \"I wouldn't wish it on anybody.\" But then he laughs. \"There is nothing in life - nothing - to equal having a position of influence in No 10. Both for the upside and the downside. And in the 70s there were things you could feel passionately attached to.\" </p> <p>Between 1976 and 1978 the Callaghan government, according to its defenders, rescued Labour and Britain from the abyss of the mid-70s and began to create a workable new version of British socialism. At this point Donoughue still believed the Tories were beatable. \"My view is that we must establish an image of Thatcher as a dangerous woman who will divide our society and create trouble,\" he wrote in February 1978. \"We are doing this now over immigration. I have pressed the PM to take it head-on and attack her for inciting racial hatred ... It is a gamble. She may ride in on the subterranean 'fascistic' instincts which are very widespread at a time of economic depression and individual frustration such as we have had in the past three years. But I think that we might damage her in a long general election campaign.\" </p> <p>Then things started to go wrong. There was the postponement of the election. There was the government's falling-out with the unions. And Callaghan became more uncertain and withdrawn. \"The PM was upstairs in the study all morning,\" Donoughue recorded a year later. \"He dealt with papers and ... fiddled around with this and that.\" He sees the same happening to Brown and his lieutenants: \"If things go wrong, you work harder. You lose perspective, and just get tireder.\"</p> <p>Official engagements abroad become a delicious relief from the struggle. The diaries turn lyrical when Donoughue goes to India and America. Callaghan, infamously, went to palmy Guadeloupe for a summit during the great waves of strikes in the Winter of Discontent. But the drabness and difficulties of domestic politics wait to ambush returning prime ministers: back from Guadeloupe, Callaghan held a testy press conference about the strikes in an airport corridor. \"Crisis? What Crisis?\" was the Sun's memorably merciless summary of his answers. </p> <p>And when governments seem inadequate, opposition parties often start to seem plausible. \"Mrs Thatcher's speech,\" Donoughue wrote of a Commons debate soon after Callaghan's return, \"was extremely effective, passionate and with a slashing attack on the excesses of union power. Typical of her at her best, articulating popular resentment and prejudices.\" </p> <p>A fortnight later he recorded: \"Question Time did not go too well ... The Tories are an unbeatable horse ... The PM ... just looked weak.\" Observers of Brown being taunted by David Cameron and George Osborne in the Commons this year will know what he means.</p> <p>At some stage failing governments pass a point of no return. For Callaghan, this came in early 1979, when the Winter of Discontent was at its iciest and his administration seemed numbed. Donoughue wrote on 18 January: \"The flow of [official] papers has completely stopped ... Whitehall has come to a total halt while they wait to see which way the cat will jump politically.\" He remembers now, \"It was like being on a liner in mid-ocean when all the engines have stopped. Just drifting silently. The civil service just backs off. If they thought Brown was going to lose power imminently, that would happen again.\"</p> <p>Another terminal symptom is the subtle act of disloyalty by a high-profile minister. \"People start positioning themselves for the future,\" Donoughue continues. \"Cultivating union support in case they should make a bid for the leadership. Not going on TV to defend the government. Making speeches that are more about the future than the present.\" Do David Miliband's activities this summer fit this pattern? Donoughue pauses. As a Labour peer, he will have a little positioning of his own to do should Brown fall. \"I wasn't sure.\"</p> <p>Of course, no two governments follow the same arc. The popularity and effectiveness of Callaghan's rose and fell with the period's volatile economy and industrial relations. Right up to the last days of the 1979 general election campaign, senior Labour and Conservative politicians and respected commentators suspected cunning old \"Uncle Jim\" might just win. The trajectory of the Brown administration has been much more relentlessly downward. </p> <p>But Donoughue has not quite written it off. \"In 79, at the start of the campaign, we were 22% behind in an Observer poll. On election day we lost by 7%. We clawed back 15 points. That's why Gordon should read about that period. Things were even worse then.\" The current government, he points out, has still got nearly two years to erase its 20% deficit in the polls. And if it doesn't? \"Opposition is always bad. You fight each other. If we go into opposition, we'll go in for 10 or 15 years.\"</p> <p>His party's often bleak history supports this prediction. At the fag end of Blair and Brown's long ascendancy, it is sometimes easy to forget that, well over a century since its foundation, Labour has only had half a dozen periods in office in Britain. And when Labour governments have most decisively lost general elections - 1931, 1951 and 1979 - each time it has then spent more than a dozen years in opposition. If a sinking Labour administration is one of British politics' sadder spectacles, then Labour's many decades out of office, dominated by prime ministers that never quite were, like Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Neil Kinnock, represent an equally fundamental form of failure.</p> <p>The day after the 1979 election, Donoughue recorded: \"As I walked across Horse Guards Parade to get my car from its privileged parking space for the last time, I was held up by a speeding cavalcade of black cars. Mrs Thatcher waved, unseeing, as she flashed by towards Whitehall. A second car was full of police. A third was ... driven by [Callaghan's] former driver... The latter peeled off across Horse Guards to the back of No 10 and [Callaghan's former private secretary] Ken Stowe leaped out and sprinted through the back gate... in order to be there, waiting inside the front door, with the applauding lines of staff, greeting his new prime minister.\"</p> <p>Power can taste flat to a beleaguered government. But it soon gets its fizz back when you lose it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Andy Beckett is writing a book for Faber about British politics in the 1970s</p> <h2>Diary of a defeat</h2> <p><strong>21 December 1978:</strong> The No 10 Xmas party ... The PM led everybody in singing hymns in the pillared room. Everybody sang their heads off (except me, as I cannot sing!) and it was very jolly. The PM then made a nice speech, which I felt had a touch of suspicion that it might be his last Christmas in No 10. </p> <p><strong>9 January 1979: </strong>The general situation feels much worse, even though the oil tanker drivers are going to settle. The road haulage strike is deteriorating, and the railways are going to strike. Suddenly there is madness in the air, with unions threatening strikes long before the negotiating procedures have been completed. This looks very bad for the big claims that lie ahead - coal, gas, electricity, the local authorities and the civil service, as well as road haulage, all within the next seven weeks. We cannot take them all on at once. So they could sweep our counter-inflation policy away - and we don't have much else.</p> <p><strong>2 February: </strong>A depressing week. They are making progress in the talks with the TUC, but down on the ground it is terrible. These pickets are letting the sick die and preventing the dead from being buried. This has nothing to do with trade unionism. It is hard-faced, grab-what-you-can capitalism with a union card. The government has not come out of it well. </p> <p><strong>5 March: </strong>This is the fifth anniversary since we came into office. What hopes, what excitements, what boredoms and disappointments I have experienced. My main feelings now are of our impotence to move such a complex society in the right direction when the whole national personality is clearly deteriorating; and that this government is without motivation or impetus.</p> <p><strong>5 April: </strong>I am starting the campaign pretty tired. God knows what I shall feel like in a month's time. I hope the PM can survive. </p> <p><strong>10 April: </strong>The press has been appalling. It ignores what the PM says and just picks up stories to embarrass him. The same Tory \"lines\" also crop up each day in the Telegraph, Sun, Mail and Express. They are all written in Tory central office. </p> <p><strong>26 April: </strong>If we lose it will be for four reasons. Two self-inflicted: the winter strikes and the excesses of various Labour local authorities. One positive Tory feature, their tax cut policies. And a deeper secular trend of people \"wanting a change\". </p> <p><strong>2 May</strong>: The last day before the poll. And the weather is appalling - freezing cold, rain, hail and snow. In May! God really is a Tory. The forecast is bad for tomorrow as well. </p> <p><strong>3 May:</strong> This is the fatal polling day. On the way into town I called in at our local polling station. It seemed very quiet, just a trickle of old ladies. I could tell from the determined look in their eyes that they had not come to vote FOR anybody ... The early results from England were discouraging. Although it was not a surprise, I felt completely numbed. Not tired ... Not bitterly disappointed - I never really thought we would win. Just flat and numb. As if bereaved, as if somebody close to me had died, predictably but still a sad loss, leaving a void. </p> <p>We had lost.

  "<p>We are now at what we would call, in horseracing parlance, the end of the back stretch. The presidential debates - three of them, to be held on September 26, October 7 and October 15 - will constitute the clubhouse turn. Then, down the stretch they'll come for the final three weeks.</p> <p>What are the major lessons so far, the Big Questions, of this presidential election? Eleven months ago in these pages, I wrote: \"Let me offer what I think is the most important undercurrent question of next year's election: have Americans tired of conservatism, or have they merely tired of corrupt and incompetent conservatism?\"</p> <p>Unlike much of what I've written, those sentences actually hold up to time's remorseless glare. That, I think, is still the question.</p> <p>The problem is, we don't know the answer, and we won't know until probably the early hours of Wednesday, November 5. If Barack Obama wins, no matter how narrowly, we can speak of a nation that wanted a change, of course. If John McCain ekes it out, we can conclude that enough Americans were given enough reason to think twice. Conservative governance will continue.</p> <p>But for now that's all speculative, and the race right now isn't really about those things. Right now what we have is an extreme cage fight in which, on November 4, one or the other will crawl out, bloodied and beaten, but victorious. And soon thereafter the bloodied winner has to start actually being the president. Yes, it's nuts</p> <p>So which side is better equipped to win the cage fight? It's a more complex question than it seems, because the two campaigns have diametrically opposed ideas about how to achieve that victory. This is a unique situation. Usually, Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns have roughly the same theory of how to win. It's just that Republicans are better at implementing the theory. But this time, the Obama camp has a completely different theory. It's why they're not as nervous now as some of their extremely fretful supporters are.</p> <p>This is the field operation versus the news-cycle election.</p> <p>The McCain campaign is the news-cycle campaign. It is built around its television advertisements and attention-getting claims made on the stump that are all about winning that day's news cycle. </p> <p>The basic idea is, if you win enough news cycles, you've dominated the discourse, you've manipulated the news coverage, you've gotten your message out at the other fellow's expense, you've kept him on the defensive. Do all that and you're going to win. Many of these advertisements and claims are contemptible lies (see sidebar). The nature of McCain's campaign is all the more shameful considering that he's doing many of the exact things that were done to him by George Bush's campaign in 2000 -and employing some of the self-same people who did it to him to do it to Obama. </p> <p>As I write, the American political media are gently rousing themselves towards a state of backlash, and we will have to see where that leads. But as the old saying goes, a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on, and so here we are. </p> <p>The McCain adverts have had a big effect. They started in earnest just as Obama was returning from his trip to Europe. These ads weren't lies, but were outlandishly wily attempts to paint Obama as a lightweight. The celebrity-Britney Spears-Paris Hilton ad was one that people liked to say turned them off, even as its message somehow sunk in. The day after he returned from what was by any objective measure a successful trip, Obama led McCain by 8 points in one major daily tracking poll. But within a few days it had tightened up considerably. The McCain team changed the story of Obama's trip.</p> <p>The news-cycle uber-stroke of the McCain campaign was to announce Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential choice the day after the Democratic convention concluded. Obama had given his well-received speech before 84,000 fans the night before. In previous elections, he would have been able to ride that momentum for a few days. But the McCain camp cut it off utterly. It helped also that no one knew the first thing about Palin. So the American cable news channels that Friday and most of that weekend were about \"Who is Sarah Palin?\" rather than being about \"Obama rides wave, McCain's turn next.\" When Palin turned out to be beloved of the rightwing electoral base and have an intriguing family life to boot, so much the better. Obama wasn't the story.</p> <p>Since the conventions, Team McCain has kept up its barrage, daily and sometimes hourly launching new attacks and continuing to promote false claims about Palin's \"record of reform\" (that she opposed federal funding for a bridge that she in fact supported until it became politically unwise to do so, that she fought federal \"pork-barrel\" spending that she had in fact sought for her state). </p> <p>The point is to press the advantage in the daily news cycle and create a narrative. Republican thinking was put on display, perhaps too candidly for the McCain campaign's tastes, by a Republican strategist, John Feehery, who is not with the campaign but who told the Washington Post: \"The more the New York Times and Washington Post go after Sarah Palin, the better off she is, because there's a bigger truth out there and the bigger truths are she's new, she's popular in Alaska and she's an insurgent. As long as those are out there, these little facts don't really matter.\" Little facts. Nice one.</p> <p>The success of the news-cycle strategy so far has a lot of liberals calling their cardiologists. And maybe with good reason. McCain is now ahead in some polls, tied in others. He has certainly won almost every news cycle since the conventions closed.</p> <p>But the questions about the strategy are these: are regular Americans paying much attention to these news cycles? And even if they are, do they believe everything they see on TV? This is where the field operation strategy comes in. </p> <p>In Denver, I attended a meeting between journalists and Obama campaign manager David Plouffe arranged by Time magazine. Plouffe laid out the theory: the Obama camp isn't that panicked about news cycles, we're looking longer term, he said. Team Obama has sunk massive amounts of money into a huge number of field offices in competitive states (some conservative states aren't worth fighting in and liberal states are in the bag already). At the last comprehensive count, the Obama campaign had 336 field offices around the country, and McCain 101. McCain has probably opened more recently, but the disparity is still striking.</p> <p>Some state-by-state comparisons are useful. In Ohio, Obama has 33 offices, and McCain nine. In Michigan, it's 22-11. Virginia, 28-6; Iowa, 23-6; New Mexico, 18-1; Missouri, 27-7. You get the picture. Florida is the only competitive state where McCain has more offices, 35-25. That 35 is deeply uncharacteristic for McCain, probably explained by the fact that much of the McCain vote in Florida will be elderly and will need to be driven to the polls on election day.</p> <p>In addition, the Obama campaign is counting on a large voter-registration effort that's been ongoing in key states since 2006. Twenty-eight of the 50 states enroll voters according to party affiliation, and in those states, Democrats have gained 2 million voters in the last two years, while the Republicans have lost 334,000. Numbers for 2008 alone look like this in some important states: Colorado, 66,516 Democrats to 13,352 Republicans; Florida, 209,422 Democrats to 77,196 Republicans; Iowa, 69,301 Democrats to 7,515 Republicans; Pennsylvania, 98,137 Democrats to just 289 Republicans. </p> <p>It takes a lot of time and money to register all those people and set up all those offices. The Obama people are betting that the investment will pay off. It is their belief, Plouffe said in Denver, that most people pay more attention to their co-workers and neighbours than they do to television talking heads. And with all those neighbours and co-workers spreading the word on election day, they say they feel good about the situation they've created. Field, they say, will trump news cycle.</p> <p>So there you have it. Are the Obama people right? The problems with their theory are that all this field-tilling is invisible to pundits, and that there's no way to measure its success until the votes start coming in. In the meantime, McCain is very much winning the visible war, which can be measured day-to-day. And, since he named Palin, enthusiasm on the right is sky high, so he'll have his army of volunteers now, too. </p> <p>One doesn't doubt that the Obama turnout will be impressive. But there are 51 daily news cycles between now and November 4. Obama certainly needs to win a few of them. So let's sort all that out first. Then we'll talk about the big picture.</p> <h2>Dirty tricks</h2> <p><strong>McCain campaign's misleading statements ...</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It said Obama supported teaching sex education at kindergartens in Illinois. In fact, Obama voted for, but did not sponsor, legislation that would have allowed local school districts to provide \"age-appropriate\" sex education as a way of teaching young children to be wary of sexual predators. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> McCain said Obama would end new weapons programmes needed to keep America safe. Yet a McCain adviser has listed \"future combat systems\" as a programme that should be cut.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Palin has made her opposition to the \"bridge to nowhere\", a $223m span linking an Alaskan island, a centrepiece of the team's portrayal of her as a fiscally responsible governor. But Palin initially supported the project and abandoned it after the Congress did so. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> During Obama's trip to Europe this summer, McCain said his rival ditched plans to visit wounded troops in Germany because journalists were forbidden from accompanying him. Obama aides said they cancelled the visit because they did not want to use injured soldiers as campaign props.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> McCain has often claimed Obama would raise taxes. But non-partisan analysis found Obama would cut taxes for low- and middle-income households, while raising payroll taxes on those earning more than $250,000.</p> <p><strong>Democrats stretch the truth too ...</strong></p> <p>Obama and other Democrats have said McCain would keep US troops in Iraq for 100 years, referring to remarks McCain made in January. McCain was clearly describing a situation in which non-combat forces could stay in Iraq, similar to US deployments in South Korea, Germany and elsewhere after wars.<br><strong>Daniel Nasaw</strong></p>",

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> There are two main types of sugar in honey. The more fructose it contains, the runnier it will be; the more glucose it has, the thicker and grainier.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> We don't produce enough honey to meet demand. Both home-produced or imported honey can be loosely divided into 'single-variety' types, such as delicate acacia, perfumed orange blossom or pungent pine, and the less expensive blossom, wildflower or 'beekeeper's' honeys, made by bees that forage on a range of plants. These 'polyfloral' honeys are often blends from several countries. Australia, Hungary, Mexico, Argentina and China are all big producers.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> All honey is warmed and filtered before being jarred. Small producers may rely on just the natural warmth of the hive to keep the honey liquid. Honey processed on a large scale may be heated considerably more, which can dull the flavour. However, there are good big-brand honeys - Rowse's English Beekeepers' (in supermarkets) is a lovely, butterscotchy all-rounder. For a local producer, <a href=\"http://www.britishbee.org.uk\">britishbee.org.uk</a> has a list of bee-keeping associations. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> My favourite British honeys include John Mellis's strong, smoky Scottish heather (<a href=\"http://www.thescottishgrocer.com\">thescottishgrocer.com</a>), Tropical Forest's delicate borage and complex and fudgy Severn Vale (<a href=\"http://www.tropicalforest.com\">tropicalforest.com</a>). I also can't resist Rowse's floral, fragrant Tasmanian Leatherwood (<a href=\"http://www.rowsehoney.co.uk\">rowsehoney.co.uk</a>).</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> All honey crystalises eventually. If this happens, warm the jar gently to reliquefy. Honey's antimicrobial properties mean that, if airtight, it will keep almost indefinitely. But don't leave it open to the air, as it will absorb moisture and start to ferment.</p>",
  "<h2>Soft floor wanted for outdoor den</h2> <p><strong>I'm looking for a suitable outdoor floor covering for a den. It needs to be permeable because the den is made from willow. The only option I can find at DIY stores is bark chippings, which, although soft on my children's feet, would be spread all over the garden by my three-year-old. Can I buy AstroTurf anywhere, or a spongy membrane? The area measures only 160cm x 120cm.</strong></p> <p>There are several alternatives to bark chippings that would be suitable. Artificial grass or outdoor carpet is a good bet. Take a look at the selection at kccarpets.co.uk and nomow.co.uk.

  "<p>Here is a cautionary tale for anyone working in research. \"Captain Cook and Lord Nelson seem unlikely figureheads in the fight against climate change alarmists,\" said the Sun. \"Lord Nelson and Captain Cook's ship logs question climate change theories,\" announced the Telegraph. Oh that's handy. So perhaps we can just keep on burning oil regardless then? \"The ships' logs of great maritime figures such as Lord Nelson and Captain Cook have cast new light on climate change by suggesting that global warming may not be an entirely man-made phenomenon.\"</p> <p>I spoke to Dennis Wheeler, a geographer at Sunderland University and the man whose research triggered this coverage. Is he a leading figure in \"the fight against climate change alarmists\"?</p> <p>No. \"But now I've had emails from cranks around the world thinking I'm some kind of anti-global warming conspiracy theorist and a friend to them. I'm most certainly not. The newspapers grossly and crassly misrepresented everything we are doing.\"</p> <p>In fact, Wheeler had spoken only to the Sunday Times, which covered his work accurately. The rest of the newspapers copied the quotes, and the information, but rather grandly decided to change the purpose and the outcome of his research. \"It was odd reading articles which were written as if a reporter had spoken to me - I wasn't fully aware of the extent to which the media copy each other's newspapers - but worse was the brazen way they distorted our work. Not a single one of the journalists from any other newspaper contacted us to see if their take on the story was correct.\"</p> <p>In fact, the journalists concocted all kinds of connections entirely for themselves. \"Ships' logs, and thousands more like them, have revealed that recent global warming is not so unusual after all.\" Is that true? \"No. As I pointed out to the Sunday Times, the ships' log books I work with only give us information about wind force and wind direction, they basically do not give us information on temperatures, and if they do it's very scant and unreliable. We've simply never claimed indirectly or directly to have any direct evidence on changing temperatures.\"</p> <p>More from the Telegraph: \"The records also suggest that Europe saw a spell of rapid warming, similar to that experienced today, during the 1730s that must have been caused naturally.\"</p> <p>Wheeler? \"Your heart just sinks. Well, the central England temperature series, for example, have shown us that the 1720s and 1730s are a period of fairly rapid warming, but that's in recovery from the Little Ice Age, and we'd like to know more about that, but this has been known about since 1974. What we are trying to do is to shed a fresh light - a bit of background - on these long-known changes in temperature.</p> <p>\"Somewhere at the end they do quote me, but by then the headlines have done their job, and the message is lost in the willingness of so many people to believe global warming is not a major issue. And by the end it was unclear what my quote meant anyway, in its new context.\"</p> <p>How did the papers quote Wheeler? Thus: \"Global warming is a reality, but our data shows climate science is complex. It is wrong to take particular events and link them to carbon dioxide emissions.\" I could see how that quote might get misunderstood. </p> <p>\"Only out of context. I wasn't talking about the scientific community, I wasn't talking about climate change theory being wrong, I was talking about the media and others getting things wrong. Any new weather event is currently explained away as yet another facet of global warming, but there has always been freak weather. Like most people, I find it hugely irritating when people draw too much from single events.\"</p> <p>If you're an academic and your work has been \"grossly and crassly misrepresented\" by the newspapers, then I'm always very pleased to hear from you. </p> <p>Please send your bad science to <a href=\"mailto:bad.science@theguardian.com\">bad.science@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>Laura on Lancashire</h2> <p>In the decade or so that we have known each other, Alice and I have found little to squabble about. We have lived together, worked together, DJed together; we have rejoiced in our shared love of strong tea, Girls Aloud-style dancefloor manouevres and a habit of listening to Kate Rusby's Blooming Heather when drunk. But there has been one thing that has threatened to destroy our mighty friendship: the fact that I hail from Lancashire, while Alice is a Yorkshirewoman. Some of you might be hard-pushed to say what differentiates the red rose county from the white, but there is in fact a long-standing rivalry between the two, much of which stems back to the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455. Yes, if there's one thing we're good at in the north it's holding a grudge. </p> <p>So, after 10 long years of bickering, Alice and I decided to head back to our homelands to settle, once and for all, whose county is best. We would travel in style, we thought, motoring around in a 1961 E-type Jaguar and staying at each county's finest hostelries. But, in an isle not short on boutique hotels and fine dining, each of us would have to choose examples of cuisine and culture that were distinct to our native county. And if we still could not find a winner, we would have to fight it out atop the Pennines. </p> <p>Most people side-step Lancashire. It is, after all, a county that exists in the collective imagination as a grim, dark, sooty place, a jumble of suet and flat caps, pigeons and rickets. My mission was to show Alice that Lancashire is in fact a place worth visiting, that there is an exquisiteness not only in the landscape of my home county, but also in the region's industrial heritage; the mills and the mines may have closed, but what lingers behind - the factory chimneys of Blackburn and Burnley, the terraces, the canalways - have a strange beauty of their own. </p> <p>I begin by taking her through the Forest of Bowland, a designated area of outstanding natural beauty, and up to Pendle Hill, which has close associations with the Quakers (the movement's founder, George Fox, experienced a visitation from God here in 1652) and with the Pendle witch trials of 1612, when 12 people were accused of murder, 10 found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. It is a stunning part of the country with its leaf-shadowed lanes that wend up to the hill itself, and its views out over the region, that always kindle in me a feeling of flickering pride and warm nostalgia.</p> <p>Though many assume Lancashire to be in perpetual impoverishment, it actually has its fair share of glitz. For evidence you need look no further than the Ribble Valley, where the splendour of Northcote Manor and Eaves Hall have now been joined by Stanley House in Mellor, a boutique hotel with 12 fabulously decorated rooms, manicured lawns and an elegant restaurant, Cassis. Not far away on the outskirts of Preston, you'll find Whitestake Farm, a five-star B&amp;B with an holistic spa, offering pedicures, mud envelopments and a rather excellent aromatherapy massage. </p> <p>After all that frou-frouing, I decide that it is time to introduce Alice to some regional cuisine. People think northern food has little to recommend it, that we eat offal and tripe and stodge-soaked-in-gravy, but I take her to the Three Fishes at Mitton, one of three pubs in the Ribble Valley specialising in Lancashire fare. </p> <p>Later, with the light fading, we head to Queen Street Mill in Burnley. I love this place, a former cotton mill co-operative that ceased production in 1982. I don't think anywhere in the world could smell quite so distinctively Lancastrian to me; it's there in the damp of the cotton and the oil of the machines, in the scent of the engine cooling down and the dust that gathers in the factory corners. Though the looms stand silent now, the whole place seems to echo with the ghosts of these machines, and with the lives that hung so heavily on Lancashire's cotton industry. </p> <p>Friday night takes us to Heywood, for a Northern Soul night. Northern Soul reached the height of its popularity here in the 1960s and 70s, when people flocked to Wigan Casino and Manchester's Twisted Wheel to perform spins and flips and backdrops to rare soul records. There is still a thriving soul scene all around the north-west, with nights held every weekend, from the Monaco in Hindley to St Helen's Soul Club. I used to love going to Northern Soul nights when I was a teenager, and I wanted Alice to experience a taste of this too - to see people 20 years older than us wearing great billowing trousers, talcum powdering the floor and dancing the whippersnappers into a cocked hat. And as we watch, my heart swells and bobs with that same feeling I had looking out over Pendle Hill, standing in the weaving shed in Burnley, holding my eccles cake, its warmth and its grease pressing through the paper bag; that there is nowhere I love more than Lancashire. </p> <p><strong>Alice's verdict</strong></p> <p>I was going to give no quarter to our neighbours but, predictably, they got me at my weakest point: the stomach. It started with a bowl of fresh peas, still in their pods, and some Morecambe Bay shrimps at The Three Fishes (or, as our delightfully clueless taxi driver insisted, \"The Three Pigeon Kingfishers. Yes?\"), and I was theirs by the time I spotted the tray of eccles cakes in the window of the bakery on the road to Blackburn. </p> <p>But in the end it was two, quite different things that made me think a little portion of my heart could be left over the Pennines. The first was a post-downpour drive over Pendle Hill, where the witches lived, now skirted by sweet villages on either side, but topped with a proper stretch of blasted heath. The swifts were swooping and the sun shone through the rain-washed leaves, lighting them up like glass. </p> <p>And then, the Queen Street Mill in Burnley on another soggy afternoon. They were shutting up and the place was empty of visitors but while Laura did something Lancastrian with bobbins, a lovely man called Conrad ushered me through a door I hadn't noticed, into the weaving shed. My own patch of Yorkshire happens not to be an industrial one, so this felt thrillingly exotic. The walls were white and bare and cool, cloudy light came in through the skylights. Beneath them, rows and rows and rows of black looms sat. There used to be thousands in Burnley, Conrad said. And these, I think, are all that are left, just quiet and still, like they're waiting. I might go back and see them again some time.</p> <h2>Alice on Yorkshire</h2> <p>Let's face it, it's not like people don't know about Yorkshire. Stretching itself out like a contented fat cat across a good wedge of the north, there's plenty to know. But I can't think, if I didn't know it from the inside out, which one of its public faces would ever entice me across its borders. The grumbling Geoffrey Boycotts? Devastated mining towns? The strange dales'n'moors nostalgia of Heartbeat and Last of the Summer Wine? But I know there's more to it than that. It's pretty, but never merely pretty, because it gets wild out on those hills; it can be flash, but it'll kick its shoes off by the end of the night; I would concede that it can be a touch reserved, a mite self-satisfied, it holds its habits and keeps them close. But like anyone or anything who knows where it's from and what it's about, it's got plenty of soul. </p> <p>As we cross the border into Yorkshire, the sun comes out. And then goes in again. As we're driving over (or, rather, willing the tyres to cling on to) the bottom corner of the Dales, the beautiful views on either side of the road are obscured once again by the north's apparently default mix of swirling mist and sweeping rain. The sheep just stand there, looking stoic. But there's blue sky over the gentle dips and climbs of Nidderdale and by the time we hit Pateley Bridge people are heading for a stroll along the river, or up and down the high street, unaware there's a monsoon going on up the road.</p> <p>We press on to Harrogate, which some people like to describe as the Bath of the north (with a short \"a\", mind. I'll be having none of this \"Baaarth\" nonsense) on account of it being a spa town and the kind of place that likes to think of itself as elegant. It's a risky call. Harrogate can be seen as the worst of Yorkshire: conservative, a touch stodgy, a mite self-satisfied. But I love it for its Victorian Turkish baths, a lavishly tiled 19th-century take on Ottoman style, perfectly preserved. But there's nothing namby pamby about them: no tea lights or whale music. You're here to get wet and hot and dry and cool and that's it. </p> <p>And then there's Betty's tearoom, which could feel a touch cliched - with its white pinnied waitresses and potted plants - but doesn't, because they really, really mean it. Also, the cakes are ace. All of them, but we're here to eat Yorkshire curd tart, a curds, raisins and nutmeg confection, which you can get anywhere in the county and hardly anywhere outside it, unlike the Eccles cake, for example, which flashes itself about all over.</p> <p>Then we're off again, hurtling towards urban, heady Leeds, where the outfits are slick and so are the streets (it's raining again). Everyone knows about the Harvey Nichols, latte and loft apartments makeover of Leeds and I'm just showing off, really. Manchester isn't really in Lancashire, so Laura can't compete. </p> <p>We check in to Residence 6 - luxury serviced apartments in the old post office building - and swan about a bit drinking complimentary champagne before heading out, avoiding the squalls of hen parties. First it's Boutique where a delightful barman encourages us to let him create a drink for us which means we end up with something delicious made of gin and passionfruit that we will never be able to replicate. Then we move on to Room where, even though we're hopelessly late and the only people eating in a venue that obviously wants to stop being a restaurant and start being a club, the food is so good it stops me drinking cocktails for a whole hour. My starter is called beans on toast. It turns out to be some kind of crushed bean served with goats cheese on fancy grilled bread. That, I think, is the north, Leeds style. We retire to the downstairs guestlist-only bar to contemplate this over further cocktails.</p> <p>On Sunday afternoon our cake odyssey concludes with a slice of Botham's Yorkshire brack in the cosy cottage behind Staithes Gallery. (It's famous for its artists, Staithes, right back to the start of the last century. We're staying in the converted studio.) We're here because in Staithes you're as tucked into the top corner of Yorkshire as it's possible to be - a few steps down the cobbled street and you're wetting your feet in the grey North Sea, and the beck that cuts through the dark cliffs and runs past the bottom of the yard is the border between North Yorkshire and Redcar and Cleveland. I love this coast, how forbidding it is, and how fierce. And how people grasp on to it anyway. The village here is vertiginous, weather-lashed and huddled up. Sitting at the kitchen table with the kindling taking in the stove, the sound of a fishermen's choir comes in through the window, mingling with the gulls.</p> <p><strong>Laura's verdict</strong></p> <p>It was Staithes that did it. It was the kippers and poached eggs we ate for tea, and the rockpools cluttered with whelks, and the sound of the fishermen's choir and the slices of brack and the pints of Smuggler's Ale. It was enough, all in all, to make me reconsider my stance on the white rose county. The curd tart may not hold a candle to the eccles cake, and I'd sooner be out on the floor at a Northern Soul night than dolled up to the nines in some fancy Leeds cocktail bar, but Staithes, with its simple seaside beauty, was what convinced me that they're not all ne'er-do-wells on the dark side of the Pennines. </p> <p>The character of the local landscape is not so very different to that round Pendle, and the closer we draw to the coast, the more it glowers and the more I love it. The south does pretty and soft and hilly, but what gets me about the north, what makes my heart twist whichever side of the Pennines I'm on, is its hardness, it roughness; it's there in the skyline of Burnley, and in the way the Pennines shoulder those dark, dark clouds, it's in our pies and our pastries and our hard, flat vowels, and it's there, most definitely, in the houses of Staithes, clinging strong and white-knuckled to the grey coast of Yorkshire.</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting around</strong><br>Summer Wine Classic Car Hire (01484 688244, <a href=\"http://www.summerwineclassics.co.uk\">summerwineclassics.co.uk</a>) supply a Jaguar E-type for \u00a3275 per day, or \u00a3620 for 3 days, then \u00a3165 for further days.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong><br>Stanley House, Mellor (01254 769200, <a href=\"http://www.stanleyhouse.co.uk\">stanleyhouse.co.uk</a>) doubles from \u00a3165 B&amp;B.

  "<p>As if contending with Hurricane Ike wasn't enough, some Brits on holiday in Cuba are finding themselves stranded without cash after discovering that banks, hotels and shops won't accept their credit cards.</p> <p>Ann Howard and her husband, Andrew Morrison, this week told Guardian Money how their trip last month almost became a nightmare after no one would take their plastic. But why on earth would the island turn its nose up at Virgin Money and Egg credit cards, bearing in mind they display the globally recognised MasterCard and Visa logos? Heavens, you can even fly Virgin Atlantic to Cuba's capital, Havana.</p> <p>The answer, it seems, is that the US blockade of the island is having far-reaching and arguably unjust consequences for us here on the other side of the pond. The US government operates an embargo against Cuba and, as a result, credit cards and travellers' cheques issued by American banks are not accepted. However, many people will be unaware that this policy also includes the UK divisions of US banks such as MBNA and Capital One.</p> <p>A number of well-known credit cards that we would think of as \"British\" ultimately have a US company behind them. For example, Egg was last year taken over by the US banking giant Citigroup, while the Virgin Money card is issued by MBNA Europe, owned by Bank of America Corporation. MBNA issues cards for scores of UK companies and organisations, including Alliance &amp; Leicester, and many charities and football clubs.</p> <p>Ann and her husband enjoyed their 18-day holiday to Cuba - and were fortunate enough to avoid the hurricanes which have battered the island during the last few days - but almost had to fly home after discovering, to their cost, that no-one would touch their cards. \"Although we took some cash, we were relying on our cards to get funds while we were there,\" says Ann, of south-east London. \"Fortunately, the travel agent came to our rescue, but we were without sufficient money for seven days.\" The couple eventually managed to get some cash transferred from Ann's current account to the card of the agent's Cuban rep.</p> <p>She says the card companies told them they do not do business with Cuba because their systems cannot be relied on. But this is likely to be a red herring; the real answer is that, as a spokesman for MBNA explains, \"cards from US-issued banks are not accepted at all in Cuba. That is US law\".</p> <p>A Virgin Money spokesman says MBNA \"has to abide by American law\". Egg says: \"We are sorry for any inconvenience suffered by our customer. However, Egg is a UK registered company with a US parent ... and is therefore subject to certain US laws.\"</p> <p>The UK Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office's advice is: \"Check with your bank to confirm that your debit/credit/cashpoint cards will be accepted. If it cannot confirm this, bring suitable sterling or euro alternatives, preferably in the form of travellers' cheques.\" </p> <p>But not American Express ...</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:r.jones@theguardian.com\">r.jones@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Corfu was where it all began for me, for a lifetime of travel. When I was 17, I spent a month hitching down through Italy with a schoolfriend, and took the night ferry over to the island from Brindisi. We arrived at dawn and stayed in Corfu Town for a night or two, watching games of cricket on the Spianada, before setting off to find a beach to sleep on. Hitching out of town, we had the good fortune to be picked up by a watermelon seller and, installed on a pyramid of melons on the back of his van, were treated to a day's tour of the inland villages. As we arrived at each one, he would switch on a snatch of loud bouzouki music and we would join him in yelling out \"Karpoussi!\" and hand down the huge watermelons to the shoppers. </p> <p>At the end of the day, he drove us close to a beach called Agios Georgios, near Paleokastritsa, and pointed the way to the sea. We walked the last couple of miles, carrying a watermelon and sleeping bags, and ended up staying half of the summer on the beach. And what a beach it was: a vast crescent of sand that could have absorbed Torremolinos, but was graced by just three small tavernas, each run by a man called Spyros (as is the way on Corfu). We camped alongside the cheapest Spyros, a lovely man whose menu consisted of a daily recitation \"meat, fish, pasta\", and lived well on about \u00a31 a day, which generally meant the pasta. On the beach, I read The Colossus of Maroussi, Henry Miller's best book, written on Corfu 40 years before, during a stay with Lawrence Durrell, and imagined the island wasn't so different, even at the tail end of the 1970s.</p> <p>I returned to Corfu and Agios Georgios a couple of years later, as a student, and when I left university the image of that beach stayed with me, while I did a series of deadbeat jobs, and hatched a plan to write The Rough Guide to Greece, to avoid having to forge a career. Yet writing the first edition of that book, I missed out Corfu - I was short on time and roped in friends to research it. And, somehow or other, although I notched up pretty much every other Greek island, I never made it back.</p> <p>And then last year my son, Miles, was heaving with laughter at Gerald Durrell's My Family and Other Animals - Corfu's classic travel book. I'd read it as a kid, too, and re-read it now, with equal delight at his medley of natural history and slapstick. So we decided that next summer we'd go there. I called up my mate Nick Edwards, who writes the Ionian Rough Guide, and he directed us to a place called Agni, one bay down from the village of Kalami, where Lawrence Durrell had lived. Gerald Durrell's old houses are part of Corfu Town's suburbs, but you'll love it at Agni, he assured us: there's just a village, a trio of seafront tavernas, and some basic studio rooms let out by a man called Pericles. We booked the same day.</p> <p>This being 2008, we flew out on easyJet. Taking our seats, I had a few misgivings as to whether the island would have retained its charms. Ahead on the plane were a group of girls dressed in matching pink T-shirts bearing the legend \"Putting the Cor back in Corfu\". And upfront was hip-hop DJ Tim Westwood, with his posse, off to do a club date. Things didn't look much more promising as our taxi headed up the coast road north from Corfu Town, past a long strip of resorts, pumping with action. But suddenly the road climbed up into wooded hills and the development fell away. Agni was fast asleep, with little more than the moon lighting up the bay.</p> <p>When we woke next morning, the village seemed scarcely any busier. We wandered down to the Nikolas Taverna for a Greek coffee and got chatting with a friendly bear of a man called - naturally - Spyros. \"You want a motorboat?\" he asked; \"30hp will do you, no problem. Take it whatever days you want, pay when you leave.\" </p> <p>So that is what we did. Indeed, what most people on this gorgeous, wooded stretch of coast seem to do. We puttered about, stopping off to swim at one or other pebbly cove, admiring the views of mainland Albania, just a couple of miles across the straits, and then seeking out a new taverna for lunch. It feels a bit like being in a seaside version of Venice, travelling about in a motorboat. All the tavernas have their own wooden jetties and their owners will wave you in, catch your rope and tie up your boat before handing you their menu. </p> <p>We struck lucky on day two, when a taverna called To Fagopotion, in Agios Stefanos, caught our eye, and a chef called Christos Vlachos caught our boat rope. It turned out that we had stumbled upon the best restaurant on the island - and, having opened just this summer, it wasn't even in the Rough Guide. And what a treat it was. There's a pencil-written menu, with reassuringly ordinary prices, but you don't need it. You just agree a main dish with Christos - seafood macaroni, perhaps, or fresh sea bream - and he brings you his own choice of starters: fabulous plates of traditional village food, cooked better than I've ever experienced on any Greek island. Puffy cheese souffl\u00e9-pies, spiced horta greens, sauteed mussels, perfectly prepared anchovies and octopus salad. Would we like to come back later in the week, Christos asked, as we polished off his orange drizzle cake and slices of melon? Maybe try some slow-cooked lamb, which he would buy in the hills? You bet.</p> <p>Not that we spent the whole time boating and eating. The pebble beaches are irresistible, all the way north to Kassiopi, but the very best of the lot was a five-minute stroll from Agni. An exquisite little beach, approached by a rollercoaster of rocks, with turquoise snorkelling, and daredevil platforms for Miles and his mate Jack to leap into the sea. To the north of Agni, too, the boys found a sea cave, where you could swim into a narrow passage, then dip your head into the sea, and push yourself out. There was even a spot of (Gerald) Durrelling to be done, with starfish and shoals of fish, huge grasshoppers, and scarce swallowtail butterflies, whose peculiar markings give the impression of backward flight.</p> <p>We also spent a fair bit of time just looking out to sea, which is quite a diversion in these parts. For although Agni is a modest sort of place, there are some exclusive villas in the hills to the north, and a whole peninsula occupied by a Rothschild castle. That means a lot of breathtakingly posh boats. We watched, open-mouthed, one weekend, as a procession of racing yachts and motor launches that looked like something owned by Tintin's arch-villain Rastapopoulos, and turned out in fact to be transporting the Abramovich clan, made their way up the straits for a Rothschild party.</p> <p>There are ferries chugging along, too, reminding you that it is now easy as pie to cross over to Albania on a day excursion, visiting the seaside resort of Saranda and going on to the Roman site at Butrint. Or you could be a bit more relaxed, and stay at one of the hotels in Saranda for a few days, with no more bureaucracy than a visa stamp in your passport. But for a daytrip, you have to head for Corfu Town at dawn, and with August temperatures in the high-90s, I failed to muster my troops. </p> <p>I did, however, persuade everyone over to Agios Giorgios for the day, by way of a beautiful road across the mountainous ridge of the island. We stopped at Bella Vista, for a jaw-dropping panorama of the Paleokastritsa coast, all wooded islands and outcrops, and climbed up to the base of Angelokastro, an awesomely-sited Byzantine castle which, in Venetian hands, so thwarted the Turks that they gave up their designs on Corfu. It's being restored, currently, but should be open properly by next year. </p> <p>And then we took a road that hadn't existed back in the 1970s to \"my beach\", which had become a bit of a personal quest. There, while the kids were zipped around the bay on inflatable doughnuts, I trekked up the strand to see if I could recognise the tavernas of 30 years past. I couldn't, to be honest: the new road had transformed the lay-out of the waterfront, and the trio of tavernas had multiplied to a mile-long strip of restaurants, bars and supermarkets. The beach was still a stunner but it was a relief, really, to get back to Agni.</p> <p>And that's where I plan to be next summer, too. Thirty years is too long to be away from Corfu. And I've got hooked on the Agni lifestyle: the easygoing charm of the Nikolas Taverna, snorkelling around the rocks before breakfast, the pleasures of slow-boat transport (which is more like hiring a moped than sailing), the call of Christos's cooking. In fact, I think Corfu is actually just as good as I remember it in the 1970s.</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting there</strong><br>EasyJet (<a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">easyjet.com</a>) flies to Gatwick-Corfu.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong><br>Studios in Agni bookable through Nikolas Taverna (+266 309 1136, <a href=\"http://www.agnibay.com\">agnibay.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nikolastavern.com\">nikolastavern.com</a>) about \u00a3700 per week in high season.</p> <p><strong>Getting around</strong><br>Boats taking 6-8 people about \u20ac80 a day; available from many outlets on the Agni-Kassiopi coast. </p> <p><strong>Where to eat</strong><br>To Fagopotion, Agios Stefanos (+266 308 2020); lunch around \u20ac25pp.</p> <p><strong>Further information</strong><br>Greek Tourist Office (020-7495 9300, <a href=\"http://www.gnto.co.uk\">gnto.co.uk</a>).<br>Country code: 00 30. <br>Flight time London-Corfu: 3hrs. <br>\u00a31 = 1.22 euros.</p>",
  "<h2>The Hardwick<br>Abergavenny</h2> <p>Chef Stephen Terry and his wife Joanne run this gastropub on the edge of town. Stephen's pedigree is gold plated, working with Marco Pierre White at Harvey's and at Le Gavroche before moving to be head chef at Canteen and then at Coast in London. The contrast between this CV and what is superficially a simple country pub is striking but undoubtedly works in the diner's favour. How about \"confit duck hash with a fried organic egg, mustard mayonnaise, rocket and dandelion\" for dinner followed by line-caught sea bass from the Gower and then an almond panna cotta with cherries? The provenance of all the main ingredients is impeccable: Amedei chocolate in the mousse, honey from nearby Llanover in the ice cream, middle white or Gloucester old spot pork.

And the restaurant is named after a horse - Foxhunter, ridden by Harry Llewellyn, which won an Olympic gold in 1952. Matt and Lisa Tebbutt have a dedicated following for what's on offer and the result is a lively, appreciative dining room. Matt cooks the grub and moonlights as a television presenter, hosting a programme called Market Kitchen on UKTV Food, set in Borough Market, London. His background and training covers most of my favourite chefs, such as Bruce Poole from Chez Bruce and Alastair Little.

Like most of the good restaurants that have started in the area over the past few years, the owners, Simon and Kate King, have prestigious CVs. Simon started his cooking career with a three-year stint at Michel Roux's Waterside Inn in Bray then worked with Martin Blunos at Lettonie.

This restaurant and hotel stands by the river Monnow in Skenfrith, a village with a fine church and ruined castle, presumably intended to keep the Welsh under control - no chance. It must rank among the most picturesque spots in Britain. The wood panelled dining room and bar have an almost chalet-like feel, smart but informal, and the kitchen serves fine food to partner the spectacular wines. About 12 miles from Abergavenny, dangerously close to the English border in fact.

Franco was also consultant chef here for many years. His influence still shows in Lady Llanover's salt duck and the vincisgrassi - a lasagna-like confection flavoured with porcini, parma ham and truffle. Monmouth is 15 miles from Abergavenny.

But the class and skill are there. Expect dishes like poached squab with feta, watermelon pearls, shallot and thyme puree to start with roast venison loin, sweetcorn, celeriac and chocolate to follow.

Google up the reviews but basically the essential information is this. The sort of dishes you can expect to find will have a strong bias toward offal and fish, calf's sweetbreads with potato and olive cake, Scottish girolles on toast with garlic butter or seared scallops in salad with sesame dressing to start, then turbot with mussels and saffron or roast pigeon with pastilla of the legs as a main.

  "<p>That sound you are hearing may be the air running out of former Republican congressman <a href=\"http://www.bobbarr2008.com/home/skip/?s=0618\">Bob Barr's presidential campaign</a>.</p> <p>This year, <a href=\"http://www.ronpaul.org/\">Congressman Ron Paul of Texas</a> mounted what was arguably the most successful small-l libertarian presidential candidacy in history. Barr, having ditched the GOP, was to follow up with the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/07/bigtentlibertarianparty\">viable</a> big-L Libertarian presidential candidacy ever. But based on the events at a Ron Paul press conference in Washington on Wednesday, Barr may not be a child of the <a href=\"http://www.campaignforliberty.com/\">Ron Paul Revolution</a> in November.</p> <p>Paul, <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/paul/\">a ten-term Republican congressman</a>, didn't win any primaries or caucuses but he did raise millions of dollars, inspire thousands of committed volunteers and collect more than one million votes in his unlikely 2008 run for the GOP presidential nomination. Essentially barred from the Republican National Convention last week, he brought out over 12,000 supporters to his own <a href=\"http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=13819\">counter-convention</a> across the river. They heard hours of speeches extolling the virtues of limited government, free markets and a non-interventionist foreign policy that would include ending the war in Iraq.</p> <p>But ever since Paul's long-shot bid for the White House ended, his supporters have been divided about whether to bolt the Republican party or work to change it from within. Paul himself decided against a third-party bid and instead ran for re-election to Congress as a Republican, dispatching a primary opponent with more than 70% of the vote. A slew of Ron Paul Republicans began making similar runs in GOP primaries and the Paul-led <a href=\"http://www.campaignforliberty.com/\">Campaign for Liberty</a> aims to help them.</p> <p>But Paul also <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN1044154420080911\">refused to endorse</a> Republican nominee John McCain and many of his supporters were displeased with a presidential choice between McCain's national greatness neo-conservatism and Barack Obama's messianic liberalism. Obama became an even tougher sell to these would-be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/26/barackobama.johnmccain\">Obamacons</a> after the Democrat softened his opposition to the Iraq war and his defence of civil liberties.</p> <p>Enter <a href=\"http://www.bobbarr2008.com/splash/?s0820\">Bob Barr</a>. Barr had his own problems, including a record of supporting the drug war, the invasion of Iraq and the Patriot Act while serving in Congress. But the Republican-turned-Libertarian had seen the light on these issues and had devoted much of his post-congressional career to resisting the Bush administration's national surveillance programme. As the Libertarian Party nominee, he could have been a plausible alternative for the Paul voters, who outside the confines of the Republican Party may number greater than one million.</p> <p>In fact, Barr's Libertarian heterodoxies actually had the potential of widening his appeal to a large number of anti-McCain conservatives. Like Paul, Barr is to the right of most libertarians on immigration, same-sex marriage and abortion. He is best known for his working in trying to impeach Bill Clinton. Barr had a chance to unite Ron Paul Republicans with Rush Limbaugh Republicans.</p> <p>For a time it looked like it might even work. Barr performed better in state and national polls than any Libertarian presidential candidate in recent memory, zooming to 6% in a Zogby survey this July. While Barr had competition for the Paul vote \u2013 Constitution Party nominee Chuck Baldwin \u2013 he seemed to be blowing that competition away. Paul hinted that a vote for either Barr or Baldwin would be fine with him.</p> <p>Yet Paul gave his supporters no clear direction. At the <a href=\"http://www.rallyfortherepublic.com/\">Rally for the Republic</a>, organizers talked about taking the Republican Party back to its small government roots. Speakers, especially former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, talked about smashing the GOP and the entire two-party system.</p> <p>The confusion continued at the Republican National Convention, where 15 delegates voted for Paul against McCain in the roll call. But by <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/04/john-mccain-2343-votes-ron-paul-15/?mod=googlenews_wsj\">some estimates</a>, his final tally could have been as high as 78 delegates. Most of his supporters at the convention, despite engaging in behind-the-scenes brawls at state conventions and initiating credentials challenges to nail down their delegate slots, ended up voting for McCain.</p> <p>That proved true for at least <a href=\"http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/2008/view.bg?articleid=1117016&amp;srvc=rss\">a dozen Paul delegates</a> from Massachusetts. The four Paul delegates from Nevada who had to stage a credentials fight to get inside the convention hall also <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/sep/07/paul-backers-give-graciously/\">supported McCain</a>.</p> <p>A week later at the National Press Club, Paul decided to resolve the conflict \u2013 sort of. He remained a Republican, but urged his followers to vote for a third party candidate willing to sign his statement of principles about foreign policy, privacy issues, monetary policy and the national debt. These candidates stretched from Baldwin on the right to Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney on the left.</p> <p>Barr, concerned about the futility of this \"any of the above\" quasi-endorsement, <a href=\"http://www.reason.com/blog/show/128719.html\">bailed</a> on the event. But in doing so, he <a href=\"http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/022780.html\">outraged</a> many <a href=\"http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/022787.html\">Paul supporters</a>.</p> <p>Now the Rush Limbaugh Republicans are heading back into the GOP fold because of Sarah Palin, and the Ron Paul Republicans are going to split their votes between three or four candidates with different platforms. Maybe Barr can overcome this and maybe Paul can take these disparate strains and forge them into a coherent movement. But that's not the way to bet.</p>",
  "<p>It was billed as a victory rally and held in Old Billingsgate on the edge of the Thames, the very heart of historical London. </p> <p>Flyers dropped through the letter boxes of thousands of homes, inviting people to \"celebrate a turning point in medical history\". </p> <p>Spotlighted on the podium against a darkened Grand Hall on the night of March 24 last year was a charismatic figure with prematurely white hair and such impassioned oratorical skills that the several hundred in the audience seemed enthralled as he denounced modern medicine, accused the pharmaceutical industry of murderous intent and hailed vitamins and minerals as the cure for all diseases. </p> <p>This was Matthias Rath, the vitamin promoter who has been accused of endangering the lives of Aids sufferers in South Africa and who was now embarking on a further chapter of his business plan.</p> <p>Rath, who says he was born in Germany although documents he filed at Companies House say he is Dutch, obtained his basic medical degree in 1985, after studying in Munster and Hamburg. </p> <p>The 53-year-old became a researcher first at the University Clinic in Hamburg and then, during 1989 and 1990, at the Berlin Heart Centre.</p> <p>After this, however, Rath followed a path which led him to repudiate modern medicine and set himself up as the guru of a movement which claimed it could cure all the world's diseases with simple concoctions of micronutrients - vitamin and mineral pills which he sells across the world through his websites.</p> <p>Rath left Germany to work at the Linus Pauling Institute in California. Pauling, the then 89-year-old double Nobel Prize winner - for chemistry in 1954 and peace in 1962 (for campaigning against above-ground nuclear testing) - was convinced that vitamins and minerals could cure diseases. Towards the end of his life (he died in 1994), he attempted to prove that high dose vitamin C could kill cancer.</p> <p>Among Rath's claims on his website and in all his publicity materials is his assertion that Pauling chose him as his successor. </p> <p>Those at the institute in the 1990s say Pauling may have thought of him as a leader in the context of micronutrients, but no more than that - and that the Nobel laureate always said it was not for him but for the institute to decide his successor. </p> <p>Not long after Pauling's death, in what was to become a long chapter of legal actions against his critics around the world, Rath sued the institute for interfering with his business relationships. </p> <p>He lost and the institute counter-sued for libel and interfering in their business relationships. The case was settled out of court in 1994 and all agreements between Pauling and Rath were nullified. Rath was assigned some patents and ordered to pay the institute $75,000 (about \u00a343,000).</p> <p>By now, he had his own self-styled foundation, which he claims is non-profit-making and seeks donations for research, although it is thought to make millions from sales of his products. </p> <p>His basic health formula, called Vitacor Plus in the UK and dispatched from a trading estate in Slough, was selling last year to those who attended the Billingsgate rally at \u00a326.50 for 90 pills.</p> <p>He set up in the UK early on, as Matthias Rath Ltd, with a registered address in Guildford, Surrey, in July 1998.</p> <p>The business was categorised as \"manufacture of other food products\". Rath, declaring Dutch nationality and an address in the Netherlands, was a director and the company is still active.</p> <p>In 2000, however, he fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)over a newsletter with the heading \"GOOD HEALTH - do it yourself\", which claimed that Rath's vitamins could prevent a range of conditions, from heart attacks to strokes and high blood pressure. </p> <p>Two years later, the ASA made a second ruling. This time it was against a claim published in Britain by a California-based organisation called the \"Health4Us Foundation\" - which appears to provide publicity for the Rath Foundation - that Rath's \"remarkable natural approach is capable of controlling the spread of cancerous cells in the human body without damaging healthy cells\".</p> <p>Other rulings have followed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US in the same year ordered Rath to take his unproven therapeutic claims for Vitacor Plus and Diacor off his website. </p> <p>In 2003, the regional court in Berlin banned Rath from calling himself in his adverts \"the renowned doctor\" and/or \"the renowned scientist\", after a court case in which medical and scientific witnesses said he was neither.</p> <p>In the same year, Rath's theories and micronutrients were disavowed by the respected and influential Swiss Study Group for Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer.</p> <p>\"After examining the literature and other available information,\" it said, the group \"have found no proof that the vitamin preparations of Dr Matthias Rath have any effect on human cancer. </p> <p>\"They advise against their use in cancer prevention and treatment while recommending a diet rich in fruit and vegetables.\"</p> <p>The distressing case of a young boy with cancer was making headlines in Germany in 2003. </p> <p>Dominik Feld, nine, had bone cancer, but his parents would not accept the doctors' decision that his leg had to be amputated to save his life. His chances of surviving with chemotherapy were one in five, their consultant said. The parents, Josef and Anke Feld, opted for Rath's natural remedies instead. </p> <p>A protracted legal tussle ensued, as social services obtained an order for the boy to be taken into care and then the parents succeeded in the high court in regaining custody of their child. </p> <p>At rallies and demonstrations outside every court hearing, protesters demanded the parents' right to continue giving the child Rath's \"cell therapy\". </p> <p>Rath claims the boy got better, but clinicians say the cancer spread and he was returned to hospital for further treatment. Eventually his parents flew him to an alternative therapy clinic in Mexico, where he died in November 2004.</p> <p>That year, Rath turned up in South Africa, the country worst hit by the Aids epidemic with a long history of the use of herbal and traditional remedies and a government that was prevaricating over the introduction of Aids medicines. President Thabo Mbeki had outraged the global medical establishment by publicly voicing his doubts over both the disease and its treatment. He had flirted with the Aids deniers in the United States, who say there is no proof a virus causes Aids. </p> <p>Mbeki preferred to view Aids as a disease of poverty, which required economic development, not the expensive drugs with unpleasant side-effects which were by then keeping those with HIV alive in rich countries.</p> <p>Rath followed his usual modus operandi; prominent adverts were placed in influential newspapers, denouncing the profit-hungry pharmaceutical industry and suggesting that natural remedies would heal the world. </p> <p>But as elsewhere, the South African advertising standards authority instructed newspapers not to run the ads - although some disobeyed.</p> <p>By 2005, Rath had forged an alliance with Sanco, the South African National Civics Organisation. </p> <p>Sanco's operatives were handing out vitamins to people with Aids in the township of Khayelitsha and, according to his own account, also Western Cape and KwaZuluNatal.</p> <p>The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), which was gradually making progress in its fight for free Aids drugs for South Africans, was appalled at the claims Rath was making - that vitamins could reverse the course of Aids - and by the discovery that some people had stopped taking their Aids medicines in favour of Rath's product VitaCell. </p> <p>Doctors working for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, which opened the first clinic offering free antiretrovirals in the country in Khayelitsha, testified that some patients had died. </p> <p>To add to the anxiety, Rath had been seen with the health minister, Manto Tshabala-Msimang, who was later to back the healing properties of lemon, garlic and beetroot over ARVs. </p> <p>There were suspicions that Rath was hoping for a government contract to provide vitamins to Aids sufferers.</p> <p>Rath said he was carrying out a study. He has now published results on his website, claiming 748 patients received VitaCell. He says all had advanced Aids and none were on antiretroviral drugs - although there is sworn testimony that some were and stopped taking the drugs. Rath claims the symptoms of the participants universally improved.</p> <p>TAC took an action to the courts against Rath and won a ruling in June that the study was illegal, because it did not have approval to use a product with a claimed therapeutic effect. </p> <p>The court also ruled that the South African government had breached the law by failing to clamp down on those peddling unlicensed remedies. </p> <p>Rath is now appealing against the South African decision, while expanding his global reach. </p> <p>The victory rally in Billingsgate last year was funded by the \u00a3100,000 proceeds of a legal action against the British Medical Journal which made an error in its coverage of the Dominik Feld case. </p> <p>Rath used his \"natural health victory lecture\" in Billingsgate to lambast the BMJ and launch a very personal attack on its editor, accusing them of hiding \"the scientific facts about the health benefits of vitamins\".</p> <p>The Rath Foundation website is now available in 17 languages. It is proactive in eight countries - the US, the UK, South Africa, Germany, Netherlands, France, Spain and most recently, Russia. </p> <p>In a repeat of the characteristic pattern, a large advertisement, looking very much like editorial, appeared in Izvestia in February under the heading \"Russia can become a health care model for the world\". </p> <p>While Russia is under threat from the US and parts of western Europe, the greatest threat to world peace is the drug industry, it says. But it has the opportunity to reduce common diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and strokes, to a fraction of the present level - through natural health approaches.</p>",
  "<p>The two hurricanes that have ripped through Cuba over the past week have received less than a <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=20ca99fd-97e4-4f76-abe6-a807b1bd1110\">passing blink</a> from international news organisations.

Then again, the American-Cuban relationship has never been balanced.</p> <p>Last week, Hurricane Gustav ripped through the western half of the Cuban island at Category 4 force, while this week Havana narrowly escaped a direct hit by the eye of Hurricane Ike raging initially at the same level, though it was later reduced to Category 1 status. Despite that considerable mercy, Ike ravaged the whole island, from Guant\u00e1namo in the extreme east to Pinar del Rio in the far west. </p> <p>Cuba is <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jmSQr1vje6Z4LBCZAkEcNvN9WUKgD9346UHO0\">well prepared for hurricanes</a>, and the government routinely calls for mass evacuations when hurricanes descend. The <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/12/news/CB-Cuba-Hurricane-Ike.php\">current death toll</a> lies at seven in Cuba, but the <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/donatesection.asp?id=85241\">actual and potential destruction</a> belies those figures. Gustav tore out at least 120,000 houses in Cuba's western provinces, leaving crops and food supplies \u2013 already in short supply in a country where rationing still exists \u2013 heavily depleted. That was last week, before Ike had screamed its way across Cuba's countryside and cities.</p> <p>No one yet knows the price Cubans will pay for these hurricanes. Fidel Castro has likened their impact to <a href=\"http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2008/septiembre/mier3/Reflections-3sept.html\">a nuclear attack</a>. Few images of the country have reached us. Communications with friends in Havana and the coast were severely limited by the cutting of power supplies, the evacuations to mass shelters and, perhaps more than any other factor, the fear of what was, and is, to come. The Cuban army has been out in force with building materials and food, but the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/10/AR2008091002723.html\">scale of the destruction is vast</a>, and nobody yet knows quite how it will be tackled. Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Russia, and even East Timor have offered assistance. George Bush remains <a href=\"http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/22/usdom16239.htm\">ominously quiet</a>.</p> <p>Barack Obama, by contrast, has called for an immediate 90 day suspension of the US-Cuba trade embargo. <em>El Bloqueo</em>, as it is known in Cuba, was imposed on February 7, 1962 by John F Kennedy's government following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in which Cuba played its role in the escalation of the cold war between Russia and the US. Cuba's immediate presence within howling distance of American waters caused such alarm to the US government that it felt compelled to introduce financial, travel and trade restrictions on its island neighbour.</p> <p>In 1992, the US passed the Torricelli Act, also known as the Cuban Democracy Act, since its stated purpose was to bring democracy to the Cuban people. In fact, it forbade American companies from trading with Cuba, prevented foreign ships which used American ports from travelling to Cuban ports for 180 days, interned ships returning from Cuba and, on a human level, banned Cuban families who lived in the US from sending much-needed cash back to their families in Cuba.</p> <p>The hope was that Cuba would suffer an acute economic collapse. In 1996, the Helms-Burton legislation was passed, and Bill Clinton later tightened it further. Among its many strangleholds, it places wide-ranging restrictions on US citizens trading or doing any form of business with Cuba. This law, which the UN general assembly has condemned roundly for many years, applies both to US firms as well as to overseas firms owned or controlled by \"US persons\". In 2006, President Bush created a task force designed to <a href=\"http://hrw.org/reports/2005/cuba1005/\">enforce and pursue violators of the embargo</a> even more aggressively, with potential penalties resulting in 10-year jail terms as well as huge fines. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.righttofood.org/new/PDF/Cuba.pdf\">2007 report</a> [PDF] by the UN special rapporteur on the right to food highlights the devastating impact that the embargo has had on Cuba's food production and importation. The report states, by way of example:</p> <blockquote> <p>Over 80% of dairy imports to Cuba consist of milk powder for use in the social programme, imported from New Zealand and the European Union. Rice is shipped from China and Vietnam, taking 45 days to reach Cuba. By way of comparison, it would cost one-third of the price to ship from the United States and would only take two days. Increased transaction costs also affect the import of food. US products must be paid for in advance in cash or through letters of credit drawn on third country banks. The [Cuban] government estimates that incremental (transaction) costs for food and agricultural imports incurred in 2006 due to the embargo amounted to $62.8m.</p> </blockquote> <p>An embargo \"to bring democracy\" is a tool of warfare, and needs to be recognised as such. Cuba, however, is dealing with enough of her own demons at present. Whirling winds have wreaked a war-like devastation on a land that has stayed determined to seek its own course through history. It is high time the embargo is lifted, not just for 90 days, but for good. According to the Cuban government, the embargo has cost the Cuban economy over $89bn since its introduction and resulted in $258m of losses in the food sector from May 2006 to April 2007. </p> <p>The response from the US government remains dogmatic. Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice has refused to lift the blockade, saying that Bush would be prepared to respond \"to a Cuban regime that is prepared to release political prisoners [and] has a process to get to free and fair elections.\" She added: \"We can see nothing that suggests that has come about.\" The irony of both of these comments is extreme: Guant\u00e1namo and Florida are close to many Cubans, both physically and emotionally. Neither of those places conjures up the release of political prisoners or free and fair elections.</p> <p>Instead, the US has offered \"assessment\" by one of its specialists to determine what level of humanitarian relief Cuba will require in the wake of the hurricanes. The Cuban government has refused this offer, asking that the embargo be lifted so that it can buy the materials it needs to help itself.</p> <p>It is time the Americans stopped holding hostages. Democracy can't be bartered in a capital market, nor imposed in a court of war. If democracy is a tool intended to inspire and help people to determine their own fate, the Cubans need to be allowed both to build and to determine their own. If common sense and fairness cannot prevail upon the US government to change its mind, these hurricanes and the rest of the world certainly should.</p>",
  "<p>While John McCain campaigns far away from Washington, his Senate colleagues are quietly crafting an energy deal that could give his rival Barack Obama a boost of momentum in the election's final days.</p> <p>The energy pact was first sealed by 10 senators, all of them concerned that the bitter political stalemate over offshore oil drilling had drowned out any dialog over diversifying American energy sources. </p> <p>The senators drew up a plan that included concessions for both right and left: Republicans got new coastal oil drilling in four eastern states and the Gulf of Mexico, while Democrats got to keep the ban on drilling in Alaska's Arctic wildlife refuge and more green energy incentives.</p> <p>\"We've tried to address all of the above\" when it comes to increasing energy availability, Republican senator Saxby Chambliss, an original backer of the deal, said today. \"Obviously, you're going to get a lot of criticism when you do that.\"</p> <p>At first the deal got plenty of criticism, from environmentalists and pro-business conservatives alike, and little traction on Capitol Hill. </p> <p>But as high gas prices pushed economic anxiety to the forefront of the campaign season, more and more senators signed on. Obama offered his cautious endorsement last month.</p> <p>The \"gang of 10\", as the dealmakers called themselves, became 16, and today a \"gang of 20\" \u2013 with one senator jokingly offering a gang sign of three fingers in the air, to form an E for energy. </p> <p>The plan's biggest opponent remains McCain, whose camp disapproves of its tax increases on oil companies to offset its $84bn price tag. No less a conservative elder than Rush Limbaugh warned McCain's fellow Republicans not to back the deal out of \"stupidity\" and \"selfishness\".</p> <p>But even Joseph Lieberman, the former Democrat who is one of McCain's closest allies, is warming to the energy plan. \"I think we've got a fighting chance of getting something done here,\" he told the Hartford Courant newspaper yesterday.</p> <p>Perhaps recognising the benefit of increasing pressure on McCain, Democratic leaders are now likely to hold a vote on the plan next week. \"No one expects the product of their work to be perfect,\" Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said today. \"Compromise never is.\" </p> <p>At a congressional energy summit on Capitol Hill today, the energy deal's supporters got advice from clean-tech and energy experts on both sides of the ideological spectrum.</p> <p>Dan Reicher, the director of energy at Google and a member of the group Clean Tech for Obama, told the senators that no option to increase energy supplies \u2013 even oil drilling \u2013 should be refused. </p> <p>\"We do need to do everything,\" he said, adding a meaningful caveat: \"If I had to weight this, I'd say there's a big opportunity to first cut demand, so it's traditional or alternative supplies that we meet that demand with.\"</p> <p>Members of the \"gang of 20\" used the energy summit to tout their plan, displaying confidence in its ability to win Senate approval before this year's session ends in two weeks.</p> <p>The prospect of isolating McCain from fellow Republicans who support the deal, with Obama lending his support for the compromise, could entice even more Democrats to come on board.</p> <p>Even if the pact can pass, however, it would still have a long way to go before becoming law. Approval would still be required in the House of Representatives, where liberals and conservatives have a stronger pull on their respective parties and could unite to bring down the plan.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337554661\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1790935088_gdn-nat-080912-sf-rath-01-VFa-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>It was billed as a victory rally and held in Old Billingsgate, on the edge of the Thames and in the heart of historical London. </p> <p>Fliers were dropped through thousands of letterboxes, inviting people to \"celebrate a turning point in medical history\". </p> <p>A charismatic figure with prematurely white hair was spotlit on the podium in a darkened Grand Hall on the night of March 24 last year.</p> <p>His impassioned oratorical skills were such that the several hundred people in the audience seemed enthralled as he denounced modern medicines, accused the pharmaceutical industry of murderous intent and hailed vitamins and minerals as the cure for all diseases. </p> <p>The man was Matthias Rath, the vitamin salesman who has been accused of endangering the lives of Aids sufferers in South Africa and who was embarking on a further chapter in his business plan.</p> <p>Rath, who says he was born in Germany - although documents he filed at Companies House say he is Dutch - obtained his basic medical degree in 1985 after studying in Munster and Hamburg. </p> <p>The 53-year-old first became a researcher at the University Clinic, in Hamburg, and then, during 1989 and 1990, at the Berlin Heart Centre.</p> <p>After this, however, Rath followed a path that led him to repudiate modern medicine and set himself up as the guru of a movement claiming it could cure all the world's diseases with simple concoctions of micronutrients - vitamin and mineral pills which he sells across the globe through the website of the Dr Rath Foundation.</p> <p>He then left Germany to work at the Linus Pauling Institute in California. </p> <p>Pauling, the then 89-year-old double Nobel Prize winner - for chemistry in 1954 and peace in 1962 - was convinced that vitamins and minerals could cure diseases. Towards the end of his life (he died in 1994) he attempted to prove that high dose vitamin C could kill cancer.</p> <p>Among the claims on Rath's website and in all his publicity materials is his assertion that Pauling chose him as his successor. </p> <p>Those at the institute in the 90s say Pauling may have thought of Rath as a leader in the context of micronutrients, but no more than that.</p> <p>They also say the Nobel Laureate always said it was not for him, but for the institute, to decide his successor. </p> <p>Not long after Pauling's death, in what was to become a long chapter of legal actions against his critics around the world, Rath sued the institute for interfering with his business relationships. </p> <p>He lost, and the institute counter-sued for libel and interfering in its business relationships. The case was settled out of court in 1994, and all agreements between Pauling and Rath were nullified. Rath was assigned some patents and ordered to pay the institute $75,000.</p> <p>By now, he had his own self-styled foundation, which he claimed to be non profit-making and seeking donations for research, although it is thought to make millions from sales of his products. </p> <p>His basic health formula, called Vitacor Plus in the UK and dispatched from a trading estate in Slough, was selling last year to those who attended the Billingsgate rally at \u00a326.50 for 90 pills.</p> <p>He set up in the UK early on, as Matthias Rath Ltd, with a registered address in Guildford, Surrey, in July 1998.</p> <p>The business was categorised as \"manufacture of other food products\". Rath, declaring Dutch nationality and an address in the Netherlands, was a director, and the company is still active.</p> <p>In 2000, however, he fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority over a newsletter with the heading: \"GOOD HEALTH - do it yourself\".</p> <p>The newsletter claimed his vitamins could prevent a range of conditions from heart attacks to strokes and high blood pressure. </p> <p>Two years later, the ASA made a second ruling. This time, it was against a claim published in Britain by a California-based organisation called the \"Health4Us Foundation\", which appeared to provide publicity for the Rath Foundation, that Rath's \"remarkable natural approach is capable of controlling the spread of cancerous cells in the human body without damaging healthy cells\".</p> <p>Other rulings have followed. In the same year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US ordered Rath to take his unproven therapeutic claims for Vitacor Plus and Diacor off his website.</p> <p>In 2003, the regional court in Berlin banned him from calling himself \"the renowned doctor\" and/or \"the renowned scientist\" in his adverts following a court case in which medical and scientific witnesses said he was neither. </p> <p>In the same year, Rath's theories and micronutrients were disavowed by the respected and influential Swiss Study Group for Complementary and Alternative Methods in Cancer.</p> <p>\"After examining the literature and other available information,\" it said, it had \"found no proof that the vitamin preparations of Dr Matthias Rath have any effect on human cancer\".</p> <p>It advised \"against their use in cancer prevention and treatment while recommending a diet rich in fruit and vegetables\".</p> <p>In Germany, the distressing case of a young boy with cancer was making headlines in 2003. </p> <p>Nine-year-old Dominik Feld had bone cancer, but his parents would not accept doctors' decision that his leg would have to be amputated to save his life. </p> <p>His chances of surviving with chemotherapy were one in five, his consultant said, and his parents, Josef and Anke Feld, opted for Rath's natural remedies instead. </p> <p>A protracted legal tussle ensued as social services obtained an order for the boy to be taken into care and the parents succeeded in a high court action to regain custody of their child. </p> <p>At rallies and demonstrations outside every court hearing, protesters demanded the parents' right to continue giving the child Rath's \"cell therapy\".</p> <p>Rath claims the boy got better, but clinicians say the cancer spread and he was returned to hospital for further treatment. Eventually, his parents flew him to an alternative therapy clinic in Mexico, where he died in November 2004.</p> <p>That year, Rath turned up in South Africa, the country worst-hit by the Aids epidemic. It had a long tradition of the use of herbal and traditional remedies and a government that was prevaricating over the introduction of Aids medicines.</p> <p>The president, Thabo Mbeki, had outraged the global medical establishment by publicly voicing his doubts over both the disease and its treatment. He had flirted with Aids deniers in the US, who say there is no proof that a virus causes Aids.</p> <p>Mbeki preferred to view Aids as a disease of poverty, which required economic development, and not the expensive drugs, with unpleasant side-effects, that were by then keeping those with HIV alive in rich countries.</p> <p>Rath followed his usual modus operandi - prominent adverts were placed in influential newspapers, denouncing the profit-hungry pharmaceutical industry and suggesting that natural remedies would heal the world. </p> <p>But, as elsewhere, South African advertising standards officials instructed newspapers not to run the ads, although some disobeyed.</p> <p>By 2005, Rath had forged an alliance with Sanco, the South African National Civic Organisation. </p> <p>Sanco's operatives were handing out vitamins to people with Aids in the township of Khayelitsha and also - according to Rath's own account - Western Cape and KwaZuluNatal.</p> <p>The Treatment Action Campaign, which was gradually making progress in its fight for free Aids drugs for South Africans, was appalled at the claims Rath was making - that vitamins could reverse the course of Aids - and the discovery that some people had stopped taking Aids medicines in favour of his VitaCell product. </p> <p>Doctors working for Medecins Sans Frontieres, which opened the first clinic offering free antiretrovirals in the country in Khayelitsha, testified that some patients had died. </p> <p>To add to the anxiety, Rath had been seen with the health minister, Manto Tshabala Msimang, who was later to back the healing properties of lemon, garlic and beetroot over ARVs. </p> <p>There were suspicions that Rath was hoping for a government contract to provide vitamins to Aids sufferers.</p> <p>Rath said he was carrying out a study. He has now published results on his website, claiming 748 patients received VitaCell. </p> <p>He says all had advanced Aids and none were on antiretroviral drugs, although there is sworn testimony that some were and had stopped taking the drugs. Rath claims the symptoms of the participants universally improved.</p> <p>TAC took an action against Rath to the courts and, in June this year, won a ruling that the study was illegal because it did not have approval to use a product with a claimed therapeutic effect. </p> <p>The court also ruled that the South African government had breached the law by failing to clamp down on those peddling unlicensed remedies. </p> <p>Rath is now appealing against the South African decision, while expanding his global reach. </p> <p>The victory rally in Billingsgate was funded by the \u00a3100,000 proceeds of a legal action against the British Medical Journal, which made an error in its coverage of the Feld case. </p> <p>Rath used his Billingsgate lecture to lambest the BMJ and launch a personal attack on its editor, accusing the magazine of hiding \"the scientific facts about the health benefits of vitamins\".</p> <p>The Rath Foundation website is now available in 17 languages. It is proactive in eight countries - the US, the UK, South Africa, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain and, most recently, Russia. </p> <p>In a repeat of the characteristic pattern, a large advertisement, looking very much like editorial, appeared in Izvestia in February under the heading: \"Russia can become a healthcare model for the world\". </p> <p>While Russia is under threat from the US and parts of western Europe, the greatest threat to world peace is the drug industry, it says. </p> <p>But, it adds, Russia has the opportunity to reduce common diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and strokes, to a fraction of the present level - through natural health approaches.</p>",

  "<p>After years of questioning the scientific consensus, Sarah Palin switched her position yesterday on the origins of climate change, agreeing that human activity contributes to rising global temperatures.</p> <p>\"I believe that man's activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming, climate change,\" Palin told ABC news, in her first mainstream interview since John McCain chose her as his vice-presidential nominee.</p> <p>Palin had previously cast doubt on the cause of rapid Arctic sea ice melting in her home state of Alaska. One day before she joined the Republican ticket in August, she told conservative website NewsMax: \"I'm not one \u2026 who would attribute [climate change] to being man-made.\"</p> <p>Palin's shift brings her more in line with McCain, who has acknowledged that warming comes from the burning of fossil fuels and vowed to regulate US carbon emissions as president. </p> <p>But the Alaska governor also expressed sympathy with fellow conservatives who continue to believe \u2013 in the face of broad scientific consensus \u2013 that observed climate change is a natural variation unrelated to human activity. </p> <p>\"Whether it's entirely, wholly caused by man's activities or is part of the cyclical nature of our planet, the warming and the cooling trends \u2013 regardless of that, John McCain and I agree that we've got to do something about it,\" Palin said.</p> <p>She also challenged ABC anchor Charles Gibson to produce proof of her prior denial of the origins of climate change: \"Show me where I have ever said that there's absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any effect or no effect on climate change.\"</p> <p>Eight months before Palin's NewsMax interview, she told a local Alaska newspaper: \"I'm not an Al Gore, doom-and-gloom environmentalist blaming the changes in our climate on human activity\". And before her 2006 election as governor, her spokesman said Palin believed \"the jury is still out\" on the origins of climate change.</p> <p>While Palin's shift towards the McCain position on climate change may comfort US environmentalists seeking a carbon cap next year, her confident support for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is sure to agitate the green movement.</p> <p>McCain, who opposed most new drilling before this year, now strongly backs adding oil rigs to the American coastlines. He hinted that he may soon assent to opening the protected ANWR area in Alaska to oil companies.</p> <p>Palin, a vocal proponent of ANWR drilling, told ABC that she felt McCain would come to see the issue from her point of view.</p> <p>\"We'll agree to disagree, but I'm gonna keep pushing that [with McCain] and I think eventually we're all going to come together on that one,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>It was a familiar scene in a state along the drug-torn Mexico-Texas border -- a group of men lying face down with their hands tied behind their backs -- except these 35 men were wearing the dark blue pants and light blue shirts issued to the local police.</p> <p>Soldiers and federal agents captured the cops in Torreon, Coahuila, after a shootout this week in which 28 city patrol pickups were sent to free five Gulf cartel operatives just arrested by federal police, authorities said.</p> <p>On Thursday, the 35 police were charged with attempted murder and drug crimes and moved from jail to a state prison.</p> <p>And it was just one of several cases of high-profile police corruption or misconduct this week.</p> <p>On the opposite side of the country, where Mexico borders Guatemala, another big police bust this week netted 26 agents, including the Tabasco state police chief. They were allegedly on a payroll doled out to officers by the Zetas, a paramilitary group linked to the Gulf cartel.</p> <p>And in the beach resort of San Jose del Cabo, six officers are under house arrest for allegedly beating an American tourist to death at the local jail in August. </p> <p>Federal police and army soldiers are increasingly taking on local and state law enforcement groups that have sold out to drug traffickers and kidnappers, analysts say. And the criminal groups are rapidly spreading their influence far beyond the US-Mexico border, where police collusion with narcos has been legendary.</p> <p>The sudden airing of high-profile cases shows not just the familiar pattern of corrupt cops, but also the takeover of local and state law enforcement by the cartels and kidnappers, one security consultant said.</p> <p>\"What is new in terms of the narcos is that they have the money to buy off the local police force anytime they want to,\" said Jon French, head of the Mexico City firm Problem Solvers. \"You had corrupt police in the past, but not to this extent because you didn't have such a narco problem.\"</p> <p>With the 350,000 state and local police outnumbering their drug-fighting federal counterparts by nearly 20-to-1, President Felipe Calderon faces an uphill task to neutralise corrupt local forces, analysts said.</p> <p>But the corruption is not limited to poorly paid local and state police. A federal police commander was among those arrested in Tabasco, and Mexico City authorities implicated a female officer from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a kidnapping ring that often killed its young victims.</p> <p>French said the record level of drug violence and busts of corrupt police has a counter-intuitive upside: Calderon's drug crackdown is fuelling the narco turf war and the internecine slayings among the cartels and their official protectors.</p> <p>Police involvement in the complex turf war among the Gulf, Sinaloa, Juarez and other cartels has also led to a record 450 police deaths this year, including 75 in August.</p> <p>\"I would be worried if there was no news at all on this front because that would mean the narcos were in control,\" said French, who gives security advice to US and Mexican business executives.</p> <p>But other security experts see it differently: the record 3,500 drug-related killings this year and the growing co-optation of local and state forces show that the government has lost control of wide swaths of Mexican territory.</p> <p>As drug traffickers' power grows through new businesses like kidnapping, protection rackets and even the distribution of pirated goods like music CDs and videos, so does their power to corrupt police, analysts said.</p> <p>\"The power of organised crime is growing and spreading to new territories,\" said Arturo Yanez, a former adviser to the federal government on security issues. \"With it, we see the weakening and the disintegration of law enforcement institutions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last month a Baluch MP stood up in the Pakistani parliament and announced that the killing of five women and two men in a remote Baluchi village was valid on the grounds of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/03/gender.pakistan\">tradition</a>.</p> <p>Doubly horrendous (bar a few reported protest of \"barabarism\") was parliament's apparent acquiescence. This would never have been countenanced in the first decades of Pakistan's independence. So where are the outspoken, upright politicians now? Who is fighting for justice and progress? And when did the rot set in?</p> <p>I grew up in Pakistan in the 1950s in the same millieu as Benazir Bhutto, when women in politics and the voluntary sector had strong views on running the country and an even stronger voice to express them. My mother, like Bhutto's, was involved in voluntary public service; family laws were amended in favour of women and their inheritance rights were restored. Women were politicised. They knew their power. My aunt was an MP, my great aunt a member of the provincial assembly, representing just such tribal areas as the one in which the Baluch women were killed. They worked tirelessly to lay the foundations for a liberal, forward-looking nation: rehabilitating refugees, providing education, training and employment. And why wouldn't they? Pakistan's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had put it on the agenda:</p> <blockquote> <p>No nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you; we are victims of evil customs. It is a crime against humanity that our women are shut up within the four walls of the houses as prisoners. There is no sanction anywhere for the deplorable condition in which our women have to live.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jinnah and his sister, Fatima, provided a potent example by standing together at political rallies and she once sat beside him in a grand assembly of the most macho of Pakistani tribal chiefs \u2013 the Baluch and the Pashtun.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jazbah.org/raanak.php\">Rana Liaquat Ali Khan</a>, another early pioneer inspired a generation of women to train as nurses to be mobilised in times of crisis. And when she was accused of misleading women, her husband, the prime minister, publicly challenged her detractors:</p> <blockquote> <p>Where has my wife taken the people of Pakistan? To the dance halls? No! She has taken them to work in the refugee camps. Where has my wife led the women of Pakistan? To gambling dens? No! It is to hospitals to work as nurses that she has led them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Liaquat Ali Khan went on to be one of Pakistan's first women ambassadors in the 1950s and in the 1980s she spoke out against General Zia ul-Haq for passing laws against women that contravened the teachings of Islam. She got away with it.</p> <p>Fatima Jinnah stood for president in 1965 against <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayub_Khan\">Ayub Khan</a>. She narrowly lost the election but won a greater victory: a fatwa giving women access to the country's premier post. Women growing up in the 1960s no longer saw gender as a barrier to anything.</p> <p>It would be naive to claim that it was so for all Pakistani women \u2013 but the doors were open. The task ahead was to spread this sense of empowerment. Surely such role models should have produced a nation of strong-minded politicians. A few exist, but they are voices in the wilderness, valued more by the international community than within Pakistan.</p> <p>As a British Pakistani, living and working in London for the last 38 years, I must question my own right to expect such a high level of commitment from the women living in Pakistan. Because, shockingly, for all our finely-wrought responses to human rights in the UK, I cannot hold my head up and say to the women suffering persecution that the British system would work for them. We have the rhetoric but not the compassion, knowledge or will. Shockingly, if the Baluch women had claimed asylum here, they may well have been sent back to die the same way. As a psychotherapist working in the voluntary sector, I have seen it repeatedly; women beaten half to death, women maimed and threatened for choosing their own partner, refusing to sign over their property, belonging to a political party or defending a daughter's right to study.</p> <p>The UN's 1951 refugee convention makes it clear that refugees who show a \"well-grounded fear of persecution\" on grounds of \"race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion\" are eligible for asylum. So are those whose state authorities fail to protect them. But the UK Home Office contends it cannot responsible for the failure of another state. They pit the phrase \"well-founded fear\" against presumed fear and claim to assess the situation \"objectively\". They disregard reports highlighting the plight of these women and regularly send them back, not because their account of persecution has been discredited but because, they claim, they will be safe in a different area. It's a Pontius Pilate act; but we cannot wash the guilt off our hands. There is no logic in their \"objectivity\". We are sending refugees back to die.</p> <p>Pakistan consists of several regions, each with its distinctive language and culture. A Punjabi in Sindh is easily distinguishable from a Baluch in Peshawar. Regional indicators are easily observed in all but the most sophisticated city dwellers. A woman unsupported by family or clan is instantly vulnerable. Nor does she have a means of securing a livelihood.</p> <p>Dr Nafis Sadik, former executive director of the United Nations Population Fund said, in 1994:</p> <blockquote> <p>As women, we must be courageous in speaking out on the issues that concern us: we must not bend under the weight of spurious arguments invoking cultural or traditional values. No value worth the name supports the oppression and enslavement of women. The function of culture and tradition is to provide a framework for human wellbeing. If they are used against us, we will reject them and move on. We will not allow ourselves to be silenced.</p> </blockquote> <p>It seems no one's listening.</p>",

  "<p>Residents in parts of Texas were today told to evacuate their homes or face \"certain death\" from flooding caused by the oncoming hurricane Ike.</p> <p>Forecasters issued the warning to people living in homes facing the Gulf of Mexico along a low-lying stretch of Galveston Island and the neighbouring Bolivar peninsula.<br> A wall of water being pushed onshore by the storm could cause floods of up to 7 metres (22ft) above sea level, enough to cover many houses on the island, according to the National Weather Service.</p> <p>\"Persons not heeding evacuation orders in single-family, one- or two-storey homes will face certain death,\" the service said in a local bulletin. \"Many residences of average construction directly on the coast will be destroyed.\"</p> <p>Almost a million people along the Texan coast have been ordered to evacuate their homes before the powerful hurricane strikes the heart of the US refining industry early tomorrow morning.</p> <p>The storm has already killed more than 70 people in the Caribbean, including 66 Haitians and four Cubans. It has also caused billions of pounds worth of damage across the region, with 80% of homes in the Turks and Caicos Islands said to be damaged. </p> <p>At 12 midday GMT today, Ike was about 230 miles (370km) south-east of Galveston, with winds above 100mph.</p> <p>The hurricane's predicted path will take it through Galveston and on to Houston, the fourth largest city in the US.</p> <p>But the authorities have ordered most people in Houston not to leave the city in an attempt to avoid total gridlock on the roads.</p> <p>The decision to order Houston residents to stay put is a stark contrast to how officials responded to hurricane Rita in 2005. Then city residents were told to leave while the population of Galveston Island was still clogging the roads. It proved to be a tragic decision: 110 people died during the evacuation while nine died in the category four storm that followed.</p> <p>Yesterday, as cars and trucks streamed inland, waves were already crashing over the beach on one end of Galveston Island, about 50 miles south-east of Houston.</p> <p>The hurricane is currently a category two storm but is expected to make landfall as a category three storm with winds of up to 130mph.</p> <p>Ken Reeves, forecast manager at AccuWeather.com, said: \"In contrast to the major hits in the Gulf over the past several years, including Katrina, Ike will not weaken significantly before landfall. As a result the damage potential is exponentially higher.\"</p> <p>Texas is home to the United States' biggest oil refinery and Nasa's Johnson Space Centre, which both lie in areas vulnerable to wind and floodwaters.</p> <p>Weather forecasters warned that Ike is so large that it could inflict a punishing blow even to those areas that escaped a direct hit.</p> <p>\"It's a big storm,\" the Texas governor, Rick Perry, said. \"I cannot overemphasise the danger that is facing us. It's going to do some substantial damage. It's going to knock out power. It's going to cause massive flooding.\"</p> <p>\"We're not talking about gently rising water,\" judge Ed Emmett, Harris county's chief administrator, said. \"We're talking about a surge that will come into your homes.\"</p> <p>Hurricane warnings were in effect over a 400-mile stretch of coastline from south of Corpus Christi to Morgan City, Louisiana. Tropical storm warnings extended south almost to the Mexican border and east to the Mississippi-Alabama line, including New Orleans.</p> <p>Most of the evacuations were limited to sections of Harris county outside Houston, as well as nearby Galveston Bay. But the 2 million residents of the city itself and 1 million in other areas of the county were asked to remain at home.</p> <p>\"We are still saying: please shelter in place, or to use the Texas expression, hunker down,\" said Emmett. \"For the vast majority of people who live in our area, stay where you are. The winds will blow and they'll howl and we'll get a lot of rain, but if you lose power and need to leave, you can do that later.\"</p> <p>Nasa closed the Johnson Space Centre, including mission control, and set up temporary headquarters near Austin and Huntsville, Alabama.</p> <p>Wholesale fuel prices rose 30% yesterday out of fear of the damage Ike could cause the refining industry. The upper Texas coast accounts for a fifth of US refining capacity.</p> <p>Ike would be the first major hurricane to hit a US metropolitan area since Katrina devastated New Orleans three years ago. For Houston, it would be the first major hurricane since Alicia in August 1983 came ashore on Galveston Island, killing 21 people and causing $2bn in damage.</p>",

  "<p>Anyone in Downing Street hoping to curry favour with Gordon Brown could do a lot worse than slip into his red box a copy of Peter Kellner's essay in the forthcoming Fabian Review. Kellner has managed to come up with six reasons why Labour could win the next election.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/columnists/maguire/2008/09/10/yougov-polling-guru-peter-kellner-reckons-could-win-next-general-election-115875-20730722/\">Kevin Maguire</a> mentioned it in the Daily Mirror a couple of days ago, but the full article is now available on the <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/general-news/general-news/kellner-reasons-cheerful\">Fabian Society website</a>, and it's worth a read. </p> <p>To summarise, here are Kellner's six points:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> There's an inherent bias in the electoral system in favour of Labour. The Tories need a 6% lead just to get the same number of seats.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Governments normally lose popularity midterm and stage some kind of recovery as the election approaches.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Labour is not doing as badly as the Tories were in the mid-90s.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>Labour is unpopular not because of a mistake like joining the ERM, but because of the state of the world economy. If the situation recovers, Brown could persuade people that he has steered Britain through a period of turbulence.</p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Cameron, though popular, is seen as shallow.</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>The Conservative party is still a tainted brand.</p> <p>Kellner is president of YouGov. During the London mayoral election, when other pollsters were describing Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone as neck and neck, YouGov and Kellner were criticised for reporting that Livingstone was well behind. They turned out to be spot on.</p> <p>But is Kellner right this time? For what they're worth, here are some quick observations.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> True <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/mar/11/unfairvotingsystem\">(as we've reported before)</a>, although the Tory lead is currently much bigger than six points.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> True, but to recover and win an election when you're as far behind as Labour is now would be unprecedented.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Debatable. Kellner says that the Labour vote only fell by around 40% in Crewe &amp; Nantwich and Glasgow East, whereas, in 1994, when the Tories lost Dudley West, their vote fell by 80%. Mike Smithson at Politicalbetting.com argues that Kellner is ignoring the significance of the <a href=\"http://politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2008/09/10/is-crewe-the-answer-to-maguire-and-kellner/\">relatively high turnouts in the 2008 byelections</a>. He has a neat theory about the <a href=\"http://politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2008/09/12/are-we-seeing-the-ending-of-the-tory-voters-strike/\">Tory voting strike</a> coming to an end.</p> <p><strong>.4</strong> Two things to say. I haven't yet read a really authoritative explanation as to why Labour's poll figures have collapsed so dramatically in the last 12 months, but I don't think the economy is the only explanation. The 10p debacle \u2013 ie taking money from five million poor people \u2013 must have had something to do with it. That may have been Brown's ERM.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/peter_riddell/article4727386.ece\">And Peter Riddell reported in the Times yesterday</a> some poll findings suggesting that the voters won't give Brown any credit if things get better. </p> <blockquote> <p>Populus asked voters if they agreed that \"if the economic situation improves dramatically over the next year or two, Labour will have a good chance of winning the next election\". Only 31% agreed, including 63% of Labour voters. But 67% of all voters, including 36% of Labour ones, agreed that \"even if the economic situation improves dramatically over the next year or two, there are many other reasons why it is time for a change\".</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5. </strong>True, but voters said much the same about Tony Blair before 1997.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> True, but YouGov's own figures, which you can find <a href=\"http://www.yougov.com/extranets/ygarchives/content/archivesPolitical.asp?rID=2\">here</a>, show that the Tories as a party are ahead of Labour on issues like education, taxation, law and order, asylum.</p> <p>What do you think?</p>",
  "<p>There doesn't seem to be much confidence behind Lord Shanakill in the Flying Childers Stakes, which opens today's card at Doncaster and is the first of three races there live on Channel 4. Put in as the 11-4 favourite by this morning's Racing Post, Karl Burke's runner is out to 9-2 third-favourite on Betfair.</p> <p>I never know quite how to feel in these situations. I'm pleased because he wouldn't be my favourite and this tends to back up my judgement. Then again, I'm irritated because the one I like, <strong>Danehill Destiny (1.35)</strong> is down to 4-1 in consequence, instead of the 11-2 which the Post predicted.</p> <p>Lord Shanakill deserves respect for having been placed in two Group Twos and a Group One but he's always been done for pace at the end of those races and now he steps back in trip to five furlongs. Of course, the soft ground mitigates that last problem, but then he hasn't proved that he can hold his form on such a surface, having never run on worse than good to soft.</p> <p>Danehill Destiny should love the ground, having disappointed on a fast surface on her last two starts. Previously, she had looked really classy when beating Prolific at Windsor, and the runner-up has since won a Group Two at Goodwood. The trainer, William Haggas, has offered some positive words in today's Post, including the claim that she is better than ever.</p> <p>At Sandown, <strong>Hail Promenader (2.15)</strong> is another who showed promise on soft before flopping on faster. Barry Hills' juvenile ran on strongly after looking green on his debut over today's course and distance in June, but was then turned over at 4-7 at Bath later that month, when the going was firm. Back at the scene of his debut and on a more forgiving surface, he should make good on that early promise, particularly with the yard in such excellent form.</p> <p>Winter Star and Bantry Bere knocked seven bells out of each other round Uttoxeter just two days ago and the betting revolves around them for the rematch at Bangor. On the basis that they're likely to be feeling the effects, I'd much rather go with <strong>John Fenton (5.15)</strong>, who is likely to prove well treated on this handicap debut. He's currently 4-1.</p> <p><strong>12.40pm And good luck to you DrKelso</strong></p> <p>I'm not sure how significant those entries were for Septimus and Yeats. Both are down to run instead in the Irish St Leger tomorrow, which would give Aidan O'Brien a clean sweep of this year's Irish Classics, making him the first trainer to do that since 1935. Yeats is probably going to be a non-runner but I think the Irish race was always the plan for Septimus.</p> <p>Honolulu has a great chance and should certainly be forgiven his Goodwood flop, though I prefer Royal And Regal.</p> <p><strong>1.55pm Danehill Destiny fourth</strong></p> <p>The filly ran well but got stuck in the middle of the track and couldn't find enough acceleration when it mattered. She came home ahead of the other fancied runners but was held off by three at double-figure prices, led by Madame Trop Vite (11-1), whose more-fancied stablemate Senor Mirasol trailed home last.</p> <p><strong>2.50pm Honolulu comes to Doncaster ...</strong></p> <p>... and wins the Doncaster Cup, powering past Royal And Regal in the last quarter-mile. Well done, DrKelso, and good luck with Censored later. </p> <p>It's proving heavy going for Talking Horses, as Hail Promenader could never quite get to the front at Sandown and finished a close third.</p> <p><strong>5.30pm John Fenton stuffed at Bangor</strong></p> <p>Time to go and lick my wounds.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings\">here</a> for all the day's racecards, form, stats and results.</p> <p>And click <a href=\"http://guardian.oddschecker.com\">here</a> for today's latest odds.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337550546\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Airlines and travel companies are scrambling to bring British holidaymakers back home after the collapse of the UK's third largest tour operator.</p> <p>Phil Wyatt, chief executive of XL Leisure Group, said he was \"devastated\" by the collapse of his company, which was forced to call in the administrators in the early hours of the morning after the failure of last minute talks with financial backers Icelandic investment group Straumur.</p> <p>Wyatt said XL's management team had \"worked night and day\" to try to refinance the company. He admitted that the company had approached the Civil Aviation Authority a few weeks ago to warn of its precarious financial position but that it had been taking bookings right up until it folded.</p> <p>XL's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/theairlineindustry\">fleet of planes have been grounded</a>, leaving an estimated 85,000 people stranded abroad, while a further 200,000 have made advance bookings with the company, many of whom will lose out.</p> <p>Speaking at the Hilton Hotel at Gatwick Airport,Wyatt expressed his anger at the fact that he is not allowed to get his planes in the air. \"Unfortunately it's been deemed by the authorities - the government, whoever - that that's impossible. I personally don't believe that's the case.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/\">CAA</a> is working with other airlines and tour operators to organise repatriation flights for package holiday travellers stranded abroad.</p> <p>It reckons there are 50,000 tour operator customers of XL already on holiday abroad, a further 10,000 overseas who had booked with XL Airways, and 25,000 with other tour operators who shared the XL flights.</p> <p>Wyatt reckons there are fewer stranded passengers than the CAA estimates but that the organisation faces a massive challenge in getting them back home.</p> <p>\"The CAA, believe me, will have a huge challenge on their hands to re-protect 67,000 people that are overseas now - 67,000 people who could have flown back on XL Airways, that are going to come back on God-knows-what carriers that the CAA find.\"</p> <p>\"It's going to be the most challenging airlift, I believe, that anyone has undertaken.\" </p> <p>Other airlines have already scrambled to help the CAA. BMI was one of the first off the ground with an Airbus A320 sent out of Heathrow at 6.30am to bring stranded passengers back from Minorca.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> is giving a fully staffed plane to the effort and will bring customers back for free. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/easyjet\">Easyjet</a> is charging a flat rate of \u00a375 - with one check-in bag - for XL customers stranded at overseas airports. The deal is open for the next seven days to any XL passenger who is not covered by ATOL protection.</p> <p>XL, which has a three-year sponsorship deal with football club West Ham that is worth \u00a32.5m annually and is only in its first season, ran flights to more than 50 destinations across Europe and Africa and sells through tour operator brands including The Really Great Holiday Company and Aspire Holidays.</p> <p><strong>Consumer protection<br></strong><br>Anyone who booked an inclusive holiday with XL or a charter flight through four of XL's numerous brands - The Really Great Holiday Company, Kosmar Villa Holidays, Freedom Flights or Aspire Holidays - will be covered by <a href=\"http://www.atol.org.uk/\">ATOL</a>'s financial protection scheme.</p> <p>But anyone who booked direct with XL Airways - whose flight numbers begin XLA - will have to either buy their way on to the CAA's specially organised flights or make their own way home.</p> <p>Package holidaymakers who booked with XL's Medlife business are also not covered by ATOL and anyone already abroad will not automatically be brought home.</p> <p>Other airlines are already reporting a massive increase in demand for flights as customers of XL, based in Crawley, West Sussex, try desperately to make alternative arrangements. The cost of a flight from Glasgow to Tenerife, for instance, has more than doubled to between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800. Prices for flights this evening have risen as high as \u00a31,800.</p> <p>The websites of both ATOL and the CAA, meanwhile, crashed this morning under the sheer weight of demand from worried XL customers. The helplines organised by the CAA, meanwhile, appeared permanently engaged.</p> <p>Anyone who booked their flights or a Medlife holiday with any credit card or a Visa debit card will be able to reclaim their money from their card issuer.</p> <p>Many passengers may also be covered by their travel insurance.</p> <p>Transport secretary Ruth Kelly said: \"The CAA have a wealth of experience in dealing with these sorts of situations and are putting systems in place to get people home, while the government stands ready to provide the CAA with operational assistance should they need it.\"</p> <p>The CAA has recommended that anyone expecting to travel with XL should not travel to the airport.

  "<p>As reported in the Guardian yesterday, the failure of policies to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/11/iran.afghanistan\">curb drug production in Afghanistan</a> is affecting Iran in a catastrophic way.</p> <p>Western attempts to tackle opium production have failed dismally, so much so that our country has become the main route for the opium trade from Afghanistan, with cheap drugs now widely available on every street corner to people in desperate situations. </p> <p>The result is an already vulnerable population is put at greater risk. The high number of male deaths from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Iraq_War\">Iran-Iraq war</a> has resulted in many women struggling to earn enough to survive. Some of them become drug dealers and users. The Islamic Republic has to find better and more effective ways to support these women, most of whom are single mothers in desperate situations. <br> Poverty in Iran has been aggravated by the global economic crisis and rising food prices, worsened still by western sanctions that are hitting ordinary people hard.  I am going to tell you the stories of two unfortunate sisters whom I have known very closely and have tried to help regularly for many years: Layla, a 38-year-old divorcee and Sahar, a 33-year-old single mother from downtown Tehran with three teenage sons. Layla and Sahar's father died from cancer when they were teenagers, and were raised by their mother in a single parent family.  Because of the family's dire poverty, Layla was forced by her mother to marry an Afghani refugee in Iran in the late 1980s. After Layla's daughter Mina was born, Layla's husband was jailed for drug trafficking, which led not only to a decrease in family income but to a lack of family support. Almost immediately after her husband's arrest, Layla turned to soft drugs and eventually to opium, crack, and heroin. As her addictions worsened, she turned to prostitution to support them. After serving six years in prison, Layla's husband returned home. Upon his release, he took their daughter Mina without Layla's permission and returned to Afghanistan. Layla has not seen nor heard from her daughter since 1995 and has no information regarding her whereabouts.  Sahar's dilemma on the other hand started when her ex-husband, Hussein, was arrested in Zahedan in Sistan and Baluchistan province for smuggling heroin in 1999. He was caught with one kilogram of heroin and was sentenced to eight years in jail. As a desperate single mother with low self-esteem and no education, Sahar struggled to bring up her children on her own. Eventually, just like Layla, she turned to drugs to ease her pain and desperation. She then turned to prostitution to support her drug addiction and to provide for her three very young sons.  Sahar tells me:</p> <blockquote> <p>Due to my own lack of proper education, finance and family support, I was desperate to make some money to provide for my children. I didn't want my children to end up in jail just like their father did. I had no choice but to turn to prostitution and gradually started dealing in drugs to make ends meet. As the punishment for adultery is very severe in Iran, I had no choice but to apply for divorce while my husband was serving his jail sentence. <br> Since smoking hashish did not make any difference to my state of mind, I gradually turned to harder drugs like opium and then to crack and heroin. On many occasions I have been abused while working as a prostitute and dealing in drugs.  The recent sanctions imposed on Iran have caused the cost of food and housing to hit the roof. Regrettably, I had no choice but to pull out my elder son from school, who was on his final year at high school, to start a job in a bakery shop in south Tehran.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are many others in Iran in the same situation as Layla and Sahar, living in daily despair and pain. <br> According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the Iranian government has always tried to curb addiction's huge social costs and has been more supportive of drug treatment than any other government in the Islamic world.  Even with these measures, the rate of addiction and suffering is not decreasing. Despite the supportive stance of the government, having a border with Afghanistan has, of course, not helped the situation. The authorities have set up many drug rehabilitation and prevention programmes all over Iran, especially in Tehran. Congress 60 in central Tehran is one of 600 centres that provide drug treatment across the country with help from government money. As <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/06/27/africa/27addiction.php\">Nazila Fathi has reported</a>, there are also over 1200 additional centers offering methadone, free needles and other services for addicts who are not ready to quit, including food and treatment for HIV and other infections.</p> <p>But whilst the violence in Afghanistan and the devastating effect of food shortages and sanctions continue, and without the government taking further social measures, these programmes will only provide symptomatic relief. <br> In my opinion, the west needs to be aware that its failed war in Afghanistan is making the situation worse for poor and vulnerable people in the region; and just like in Iraq before the invasion of 2003, the current tough sanctions on Iran are not hitting the regime, but the ordinary people.  The Iranian government also needs to have a less ideological approach to the issue of single mothers. It must provide support, social security, free housing and protection for them, rather than treating them like pariahs or criminals. Unfortunately, women in Iran, like many other countries in the Islamic world, feel that there is a social stigma that acts as a barrier to seeking help. They need to be reassured that it is OK to come forward, talk about their problems and ask for help. I am sure many of my countrymen would agree with me that there need to be some fundamental changes in men's attitudes to women in general. </p> <p>Another solution would be to help these women to brush up on their education and training, to encourage them to enter the workforce. This would allow them to get themselves and their children out of the vicious cycle of drugs and poverty, which has dogged them since they were young girls themselves. <br> Despite the dreadful experiences of these women over two decades, they remain sensitive and gentle souls, profoundly grateful for an opportunity to talk in safety. Sadly, when people cannot talk safely about such things, remedies for the problem cannot be identified; the silence means that the government cannot know why it is that these programmes thus far have failed to curb the devastating problem of dealing and addiction Iran. Speaking safely means finally putting an end to the tyranny of drugs.</p> <p><em>Names have been changed to protect the identity of those involved</em></p>",
  "<h2>Who are XL?</h2> <p>XL was the UK's third largest tour company, with brands including Freedom Flights, XL Airways, the Really Great Holiday Company, and Medlife Hotels. Through XL Airways it offered flights to 50 destinations, mainly in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>In June, it was reported it had made a \u00a324m loss in the last financial year and before its collapse it had been in talks with lenders to try and find a refinancing package, </p> <h2>How many people are affected?</h2> <p>The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) estimates that almost 300,000 customers will be affected by the collapse. There are around 50,000 customers currently abroad who booked their holiday through an XL operator, 10,000 who flew with XL Airways, and 25,000 holidaying with other tour operators who shared the XL flights. A further 200,000 people had booked holidays and flights for future dates.</p> <h2>What happens to people who are abroad?</h2> <p>The administrators say holidaymakers who bought package deals through XL should be able to stay in their hotel or villa and complete their holiday, and that in most cases the CAA will pay for this accommodation. Customers who are charged for their hotel or for transfers to the airport have been advised to keep any receipts as they may be eligible for a refund from the CAA.</p> <h2>Will they be able to get home?</h2> <p>XL's planes have been grounded and will not fly again, but the CAA is working with other airlines and travel companies to organise flights back to the UK. Customers who booked chartered flights or package holidays through one of XL's tour operators, or through a travel agent, will be able to fly back for free under the CAA's Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (Atol) scheme. Several airlines have already offered planes for the repatriation of passengers.</p> <p>Customers who booked direct with XL Airways (their flight numbers begin XLA) may be able to get a seat on one of these planes, but they will be charged for their journey. This is because they are not covered by the Atol scheme. The CAA was not able to say how much the fee might be.</p> <p>EasyJet has said where it has routes it will fly passengers not covered by Atol back to the UK for a flat rate of \u00a375, as long as they were due to return home before Saturday September 20. While Flybe is offering flights back from Alicante, Faro, Malaga and Palma for \u20ac90 (\u00a371).</p> <h2>What about people who have not started their holidays? </h2> <p>They will have to make alternative plans - XL planes won't be going anywhere and its accommodation will no longer be available. Other airlines have already reported a massive increase in demand for flights as XL customers try to make alternative arrangements - and prices are rising as a result. The cost of a flight from Glasgow to Tenerife, for example, has more than doubled to between \u00a3500 and \u00a3800. Prices for flights this evening have risen as high as \u00a31,800.</p> <h2>Will people get their money back?</h2> <p>Many will, but some will lose out. Customers who benefit from the Atol scheme should not be out of pocket. The CAA will provide a flight home, and will consider refunds for expenses that should have been covered by the package deal - such as transfers to the airport for the flight home. The Atol scheme will also offer a full refund to those who have not yet started their holiday. More details can be found <a href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/atol.html\">on the Atol website</a>. </p> <p>However, holidaymakers who booked with XL Airways or Medlife Hotels will not be entitled to a refund, as these bookings are not covered by Atol. Whether they can get any kind of compensation will depend on how they paid for their holiday. </p> <p>Those who paid more than \u00a3100 on a credit card will be covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, and will be able to get their money back from their card provider. Those who used a Visa debit card, or paid less than \u00a3100 on a credit card, should be able to get a refund under the chargeback scheme - users of other debit cards, however, have no protection.</p> <p>Holidaymakers who have travel insurance should check their policies, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/12/consumeraffairs.travelinsurance\">the majority will not be able to make a claim</a>, as cover against airline failure does not come as standard. </p> <h2>What do they need to do now?</h2> <p>XL customers can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/12/theairlineindustry.travelleisure1\">click here for more information</a> on what they should do, including phone numbers for hotlines set up to help stranded holidaymakers.</p>",
