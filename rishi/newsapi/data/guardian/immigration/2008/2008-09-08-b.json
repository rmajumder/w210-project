  "<p>With a moustache that looked as if he had drawn it on himself, the Mexican-born animator Bill Melendez, who has died at 91, contrasted with his sometime collaborator, the Peanuts creator Charles Schulz. Orderly in all things, Schulz once brought an old, wind-up phonograph into his studio in a doomed attempt \"to give this office some character, like Bill Melendez's place\". They first met in 1959, when the success of Schulz's droll strip-cartoon had led him to allow Ford automobiles to use his characters for a commercial, made by Melendez. </p> <p>In the animator, Schulz found a man so congenial that he later entrusted him with a half-hour television special, A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965). Despite network doubts about the use of religion, jazz and a wordless dog, this proved an immediate success. It became as much a seasonal US staple as chestnuts roasting on an open fire, and led to feature films and an even wider audience for Schulz's work, which had emerged in the Eisenhower era of the 1950s, but now found a place in counterculture circles - complete with the arrival of a bird called Woodstock.</p> <p>Schulz told prospective artists that they should be steeped in cartoon history. So he appreciated being adapted by Melendez, who had worked for Walt Disney and Warner Bros. </p> <p>Born in Hermosillo, Mexico, Melendez was the son of a cavalry officer whose penchant for Aztec history led him to name the boy Jos\u00e9 Cuauht\u00e9moc; that nationalistic spirit ran counter to his wife's desire for their children to learn English, which she thought would be met by living in Arizona. Early thoughts about draughtsmanship and engineering mutated, amid the Depression, into Melendez's wondering whether cartooning might be a more realistic job. With odd bouts of work and a move to Los Angeles, he approached Disney, who recommended that he should attend the city's Chouinard Art Institute. </p> <p>In 1938 he joined Disney. The studio had released its first animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), and was planning Fantasia, Pinocchio (both 1940), Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942). Melendez worked on all of these while regularly drawing Mickey Mouse - and became known as Bill.</p> <p>Such prolific output halted in 1941 when, recently married, he instigated a five-week strike which led to Disney recognising a union. That year Melendez moved to Leon Schlesinger's studio, where, for Warner Bros, Looney Tunes with Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Daffy Duck were created. Where Disney sought a classic perspective, the Tunes were fast-paced, screwball takes on contemporary trends and films.</p> <p>In 1948, after Warners had bought out Schlesinger, Melendez moved to United Productions of America, for which he created the Oscar-winning Gerald McBoing-Boing (1951), co-written by Dr Seuss, and a thousand acclaimed commercials, whose demand for speed and ideas he found stimulating. </p> <p>The meeting with Schulz was pivotal. The jovial Melendez impressed Schulz, who was prone to depression. Schulz's characters had grown from his own boyhood and his war service in Europe. Back in the US, Schulz evolved the cartoon strip that, in 1950, became Peanuts. Gradual syndication brought a huge audience for Schulz's worldview, which found room for literary and musical allusions as well as baseball. Like Bugs Bunny, Peanuts was enjoyed by all ages.</p> <p>In 1964 Melendez set up his own Los Angeles studio with producing partner Lee Mendelson, who had made a documentary on Schulz, which he could not initially sell. When Peanuts made Time magazine's cover in 1965, advertisers became interested, and Coca-Cola wanted a Christmas special.</p> <p> A Charlie Brown Christmas, written by Schulz, not only included Linus reading from St Luke but Vince Guaraldi's jazz score. Schulz refused a laugh track and insisted that children voice the characters and that Snoopy should be silent: Melendez made noises on to a tape, sped it up, and submitted this as an idea for Snoopy's voice - used as is. Children came and went but Melendez thus voiced every seasonal outing. Each required 800 outline sketches, and the finished result used \"limited animation\", as television economics required. Both men realised this was in keeping with the original strip - and more challenging than it appeared.</p> <p>Melendez worked until 2006, as animator and producer on dozens of specials, which are more incisive than the feature films that began with A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969), and also animated Babar and Garfield. Both he and Schulz recognised that creativity can be a mutual process.</p> <p>Melendez is survived by his wife, Helen, and two sons: one, Steven, runs the London studio, while Rodrigo followed the other family tradition and became an admiral.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bill (Jos\u00e9 Cuauht\u00e9moc) Melendez, animator, born November 15 1916; died September 2 2008</p>",
  "<p>Great Britain's youngest Paralympian, 13-year-old Eleanor Simmonds, celebrated a stunning victory in the pool yesterday. Simmonds' win was the catalyst for a successful evening at the Water Cube, with David Roberts also taking gold, Heather Frederiksen and Louise Watkin silver and Matt Walker bronze.</p> <p>Anthony Kappes and tandem pilot rider Barney Storey had earlier won Britain's fourth cycling gold of the Games at the Laoshan velodrome. The athletics team also weighed in with silver medals for Shelly Woods and Chris Martin on the first day of competition at the Bird's Nest Stadium. Britain lie in third place in the medal table behind hosts China and the United States at the end of day two with seven golds, five silvers and three bronze.</p> <p>Simmonds timed her finish to perfection in the women's S6 100m freestyle to win in 1min 18.75sec and become the youngest individual British Paralympic champion of all time.</p> <p>Simmonds, who was born in Walsall but competes for Swansea, forecast a medal on Sunday night but she predicted the wrong colour. \"I had a dream about it, but I only came second,\" she said after beating world record holder Doramitzi Gonz\u00e1lez of Mexico into third place. Simmonds, who will be 14 in November and has achondroplasia (dwarfism), broke her own British record in securing victory.</p> <p>Roberts then successfully began his attempt to overtake Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson as Britain's most successful Paralympian ever with victory in the men's S7 100m freestyle. The 28-year-old from Pontypridd, who has cerebral palsy, lowered his own Paralympic record to 1min 00.35sec to triumph, while Walker was third. It was Roberts' third successive gold in the event. Roberts now has eight Paralympic gold medals but, with four events to go, he remains cautious on the prospects of succeeding Grey-Thompson. \"That's one down, four to go. The next one is a toughy - it's the relay.\"</p> <p>Frederiksen was second in the women's S8 100m freestyle and Watkin finished behind South African Natalie du Toit in the women's S9 100m freestyle. Kappes and Storey secured Britain's fourth cycling gold medal, powering to victory in the men's B&amp;VI one-kilometre time trial in a world record of 1min 02.864sec.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-333546201\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1504924467_a07e68c9f72e3affb3f2bdeddd213a9c8a9eb946.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Wearing a headscarf and black robe as he faced the video camera set up inside the flat in Walthamstow, east London, Abdulla Ahmed Ali made his feelings and intentions clear. \"Sheikh Osama warned you many times to leave our lands or you will be destroyed, and now the time has come for you to be destroyed,\" the 27-year-old said, at times jabbing his finger angrily towards the lens. </p> <p>\"We will take our revenge and anger, ripping amongst your people and scattering the people and your body parts, and your people's body parts responsible for these wars and oppression, decorating the streets.\"</p> <p>But what Ali did not know when he recorded the alleged martyrdom video inside the upper ground floor council flat at 386a Forest Road was that he was already the subject of the biggest counter-terrorism operation in British history.</p> <p>The operation, codenamed Overt, began in May 2006 when MI5 came to suspect some of the men. By then Assad Sarwar, one of the three suspects convicted yesterday and described by the prosecution as the chief bomb maker, had already started buying hydrogen peroxide, a key bomb-making chemical, driving to South Wales to pick up consignments. </p> <p>For three months officers followed and recorded the men. Then the surveillance operation at the Walthamstow flat picked up one of the men talking about \"martyrdom operations\". Suspecting the flat was a bomb factory and working on additional leads from Pakistan, anti-terrorism officers decided to swoop. On August 9 they followed the pair as they travelled across London. Officers were lying in wait as a silver Kia Pride and a red Nissan pulled into the car park of Walthamstow town hall. </p> <p>The men got out of their cars, greeted each other, then sat on a wall and began to chat. Counter-terrorism officers swooped and arrested the two men, who surrendered without a struggle.</p> <p>In Sarwar's car police found the Sony Handycam camera used to record two of the videos. Five more were seized from Sarwar's garage at his High Wycombe home.</p> <p>Security services believed the men had devised a complicated plot to smuggle their liquid bombs on to a series of transatlantic flights from Heathrow, which would have been blown up successively in mid-air, killing thousands of people.</p> <p>It was \"a deadly plan designed to bring about what would have been, had they been successful, a civilian death toll from an act of terrorism on an almost unprecedented scale\", Peter Wright QC said as he opened the prosecution case.</p> <p>The seven films - two of the eight defendants did not make them, while one recorded his twice - provided a wealth of evidence for the prosecutors. </p> <p>Ostensibly based on martyrdom videos produced by al-Qaida, and echoing many of the group's radical Islamist sentiments, they also included some peculiar domestic references. For example, Ali accused British people of showing more concern for animals than Muslims by organising anti-fox hunting demonstrations. </p> <p>Ali, a computing graduate who spent time working with Afghan refugees in Pakistan, told the court he planned to \"make a small device to be set off in a sensitive area\", such as parliament. It would not kill anyone, but would generate publicity for a propaganda \"documentary\" to be released via YouTube.</p> <p>Ali insisted that the plot had been \"blown up out of proportion\". The prosecution said, however, that he was a militant who intended to be the only plotter to die in the attacks.</p> <p>Sarwar, a married 28-year-old Brunel University drop out-turned postman, did not make a film, something the court heard was due to his position as the man responsible for gathering the liquid bomb components.</p> <p>After dropping out of university, Sarwar met Ali while doing charity work in Pakistan with the Islamic Medical Association in late 2002. They visited refugee camps housing Afghans who had fled the US invasion of their country.</p> <p>He returned to Britain in May 2003 and drifted through two further short-term jobs as a postman with Royal Mail and for BT. He said he met Ali again - whom he described as having \"leading characteristics\" compared to his own \"weak character\"- in 2003 and in 2006 at lectures in east London. </p> <p>In between, Sarwar returned to Pakistan for two months in October 2005, aiding survivors of the Kashmir earthquake.</p> <p>Sarwar said in 2006 Ali invited him back to his flat and they chatted about UK foreign policy before hitting on the idea of a \"publicity stunt\". He told the court al-Qaida was \"deviant\" and that he felt suicide bombers would end up \"in hell fire\".</p> <p>The prosecution alleged he had links with terror chiefs in Pakistan. Sarwar claimed detailed flight lists found on a computer memory-stick at his home were just \"holiday destinations in America\". The memory stick also had information on improvised bombs, on how to attack aircraft, details of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and information on UK nuclear power stations.</p> <p>Tanvir Hussain, the third man convicted of conspiracy to murder, spent hours with Ali at the Forest Road bomb factory and was followed by surveillance teams as he bought items for the plot, including surgical needles and syringes.</p> <p>Hussain was living with his parents, brothers and sister when he was arrested. The family had moved down to London from Blackburn when he was a child.</p> <p>In his martyrdom video, Hussain, a part-time postman, said: \"People are going to die, but it's worth the price.\" He filmed a video message shown to the jury in which he described civilian targets as \"the battlegrounds of today\", adding: \"You know, I only wish I could do this again, you know, come back and do this again, and just do it again and again until people come to their senses and realise, don't mess with the Muslims.\" This was, he later insisted under cross examination, \"just rhetoric\", saying: \"It was something to make it look sensational, make it look real and was something that once made, would create mass media attention.\"</p> <p>He had Ali met while studying for his A-levels at Waltham Forest college. Hussain later went to Middlesex University, where he took a business and computers course. He told the court he regularly drank and took drugs while a student and he had a reputation as a womaniser.</p> <p>He worked in a sexual health clinic for a while. Later, he became a devout Muslim - former colleagues described him as showing signs of extremism - and developed into becoming Ali's right-hand man.</p> <h2>The charges</h2> <p><strong>Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 27</strong><br><strong>From </strong>Walthamstow, east London<br><strong>Charges</strong> Found guilty of conspiracy to murder; admitted conspiring to commit public nuisance by distributing al-Qaida-style videos threatening suicide bomb attacks in Britain; admitted conspiracy to cause explosions; jury failed to reach a verdict on conspiracy to detonate explosives on aircraft.</p> <p><strong>Assad Sarwar, 28</strong><br><strong>From </strong>High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire<br><strong>Charges </strong>Found guilty of conspiracy to murder; admitted conspiring to commit public nuisance; admitted conspiracy to cause explosions; jury failed to reach a verdict on conspiracy to detonate explosives on aircraft.</p> <p><strong>Tanvir Hussain, 27</strong><br><strong>From </strong>Leyton, east London<br><strong>Charges </strong>Found guilty of conspiracy to murder; admitted conspiring to commit public nuisance; admitted conspiracy to cause explosions; jury failed to reach a verdict on conspiracy to detonate explosives on aircraft.</p> <p><strong>Mohammed Gulzar, 27</strong><br><strong>From </strong>Barking, east London<br><strong>Charges </strong>Not guilty on all counts</p> <p><strong>Ibrahim Savant, 27</strong><br><strong>From </strong>Stoke Newington, north London<br><strong>Charges </strong>Jury could not reach a verdict on charge of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to detonate explosives on aircraft; admitted conspiring to commit public nuisance</p> <p><strong>Arafat Waheed Khan, 27</strong><br><strong>From</strong> Walthamstow<br><strong>Charges </strong>No verdict reached on conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to detonate explosives on aircraft; admitted conspiring to commit public nuisance</p> <p><strong>Waheed Zaman, 24</strong><br><strong>From</strong> Walthamstow<br><strong>Charges </strong>No verdict reached on conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to detonate explosives on aircraft; admitted conspiring to commit public nuisance</p> <p><strong>Umar Islam, aka Brian Young, 30</strong><br><strong>From</strong> Plaistow, east London<br><strong>Charges</strong> No verdict reached on conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to detonate explosives on aircraft; admitted conspiring to commit public nuisance</p>",

  "<p>Sir Michael Stoute will field three runners in the St Leger at Doncaster on Saturday, but he may need to overcome an even bigger team from Aidan O'Brien's Ballydoyle yard if he is to win the season's final Classic for the first time. O'Brien still has eight entries in the race after 18 horses were declared at the five-day stage yesterday, including Frozen Fire, the Irish Derby winner, who is the 9-4 favourite with Ladbrokes, the race's sponsor.</p> <p>Stoute has won every British Classic bar the Leger at least twice, and his record of persistent failure at Doncaster is one of the sport's more bizarre statistics. In all, he has saddled 25 contenders, finishing second on five occasions. </p> <p>The Newmarket trainer withdrew Patkai from the race yesterday, but will send Conduit, Doctor Fremantle and the outsider Warringah to Town Moor. Ryan Moore, his stable jockey, has yet to choose his mount. \"I don't think Conduit improved from his race at [Royal] Ascot to [his win in the Gordon Stakes at] Goodwood,\" Stoute said yesterday, \"so let's hope he's improved a bit from Goodwood. We're not expecting it to be anything other than soft, but we wouldn't want it to be any more drastic than that.\" </p> <p>O'Brien, talking to a press conference in London yesterday via a phone link, relied on one of his favourite descriptions - the \"strong possible\" - when assessing his likely team. </p> <p>\"I'm not sure of our plans yet as we will have to wait and see what the weather does,\" O'Brien said, \"but Frozen Fire is a strong possible at the moment. Alessandro Volta, Washington Irving, Hindu Kush, and Bashkirov are all very strong possibles at the moment too.\" </p> <p>Frozen Fire and Allesandro Volta are both prominent in the betting as O'Brien seeks his 19th Group One victory of the season. Ralph Beckett, meanwhile, will saddle Look Here, the Oaks winner, as he attempts to compile a similarly impressive haul of two out of five British Classics. </p> <p>Look Here is unraced since her easy win at Epsom, but the form has been franked several times and Beckett is hoping for a big run on Saturday. </p> <p>\"She had a problem which kept her out of the Yorkshire Oaks, though I'm not going to say what it was,\" Beckett said. \"She got over it quickly, and we've had a clear run since. The Epsom form has been franked by Moonstone and Ice Queen, and Lush Lashes keeps on going and doing it too. The trip should not really be an issue, I'm as sure as I can be that it will be in her favour.\" </p> <p>The dark horse of the race is another filly, Tommy Stack's Unsung Heroine. \"Her first two races were a bit rushed, so this is the first time she's had a chance to improve after a race,\" Fozzy Stack, the trainer's son, said. \"Wayne Lordan is banned on Saturday, and if his appeal on Wednesday fails, we hope Jamie Spencer wil take the ride.\"</p> <h2>Ron Cox's tip of the day</h2> <p><strong>Collateral Damage 3.00 Beverley</strong></p> <p>This looks a good opportunity for Tim Easterby's runner to get back to winning ways. The selection has good form on similarly heavy ground and ran his best race of the campaign last term on bottomless going when third in the John Smith's Cuyp at York. He is 1lb below the handicap mark he won off earlier this campaign and was a good fourth in a classier race at Ripon last time.</p>",
  "<p>There is no greater indictment of English football - and there are many from which to choose - than its persistent reluctance to make Joe Cole feel indispensable. Identified as a star in his early teens, at the age of 26 the Chelsea player has yet to know how it feels to enjoy the unequivocal support of a top manager, either at club or national level. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I think to myself, if I had a manager who said to me, 'Go out and do your stuff, and you can have two or three indifferent games,' as players do, then maybe I could be an even better player than I am,\" he said yesterday. \"I haven't had that in my career. I would take playing anywhere, sit on the bench, go and play in goal, for a cap for England. I do pride myself on that. But it's nice to have someone right behind me.\" </p> <p>Three goals in his past two international games, after coming on as a substitute on both occasions, may well have won him a place in the starting line-up in the crucial match against Croatia tomorrow, but for all his technical gifts, his unstinting application and his 52 caps Cole is no more an untouchable to Fabio Capello than he was to Jose Mourinho, the coach who, for better or worse, reshaped his game.</p> <p>\"The gaffer's got as much belief in me as any other manager's had over the years, I imagine,\" Cole continued. \"Footballers will say, 'I don't have to prove myself'. But I think you're in the shop window every day, you get judged on every performance, every training session. I try and do my best, every day and in every game.\"</p> <p>Capello's decision not to give him a starting place in the past three matches echoes the attitudes of Sven-Goran Eriksson, who called him into his first squad in 2001 but took almost five years to show that he trusted him, of Claudio Ranieri, who tried to loan him to CSKA Moscow soon after paying \u00a36.6m to take him to Chelsea, and of Mourinho, for whom any hint of tactical indiscipline seemed to result in Cole's omission from the next match. His golden moments, such as the wonderful solo goal against Manchester United as Chelsea secured their second Premier League title on the last day of April 2006, or the swashbuckling volley in Cologne that was part of a man-of-the-match performance against Sweden during the World Cup a few weeks later, never seemed to achieve the career-defining status of Michael Owen's 1998 strike against Argentina or David Beckham's free-kick against Greece in 2001.</p> <p>\"I've always prided myself on being able to come back from disappointments,\" he said. \"I always get my head down, try to do well. I've played all through my career with the pressure.\" With a wry grin, he suggested that things were finally improving. \"Two or three years ago it was if I had a bad 45 minutes I might not get back in the team. Now it's down to a bad 90 minutes.\"</p> <p>Had any manager ever told him that he would be getting a run of six or seven games? \"No, and I would love that. It's the Holy Grail for any footballer. You'd love to have that kind of belief from your manager. I hope it's my time.\"</p> <p>It is more than a decade since Glenn Hoddle brought the perky 16-year-old Cole into a training session at Bisham Abbey, where an England squad including Alan Shearer and Paul Gascoigne were in the throes of preparing for a 1998 World Cup qualification match. He had already scored seven of the eight goals amassed by England's youth team in a match against Spain. Still a year away from his first-team debut at Upton Park, he was being spoken of as the next Hoddle or Gascoigne, a playmaker of audacious skills and uncommon vision. A natural No10, in fact.</p> <p>Instead, the men who have had the greatest influence over his career asked him to adapt his gifts to suit their own purposes. Eriksson and Mourinho both required him to play on the flanks and attend to defensive duties. Being a diligent sort, Cole complied - at the expense not only of compromising his special qualities but of exposing himself to competition from specialist wide players. </p> <p>\"My best position is definitely playing off the two strikers, going left and right,\" he said. \"Nowadays you look at players in my position who play there, like - not comparing myself to them at all - but players like [Lionel] Messi, Ronaldinho, [Cristiano] Ronaldo. They play left, right and centre. Football has become very fluid. Look at the movement of teams like Manchester United. You just need to be an attacking midfielder, basically, in my position. You have to be sound defensively, and there has to be some structure. But there has to be movement.\"</p> <p>In order to help him adapt to his new role, he paid attention to the way others handled it. \"I've changed my game over the years, mixing it up, sometimes making runs without the ball. I've studied a lot of players who do that, and it bears fruit. I end up nicking goals here and there. I watched [Ludovic] Giuly at Barcelona because I was playing in the same position and he had a fantastic couple of years there. He is one of the best at making those kind of runs.\"</p> <p>And, finally, Cole confirmed that he and Wayne Rooney had indeed provoked an angry fusillade from Capello during the second half against Andorra. \"He wanted us to play a little bit closer to Emile [Heskey], particularly once we were 2-0 up. I've been asked whether I was disappointed to be criticised by the manager, but of course I wasn't. That's what he's there for. He just asked us to play further forward.

  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>Progressive. </p> <p>\"Absolutely. I remember at school we had a debate as to whether Margaret Thatcher was the least Conservative MP ever. I think it's the same with David Cameron. Obviously, the Conservative ideal is constant, but it's how we apply that to the modern age that's key. We're very keen to end the decline of social mobility, without regimenting people.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We have to spend what we have in the most effective way. It's a delicate balance and goodness knows what public finances are going to be like in 18 months' time. Fiscal stability comes first. There are huge underfunded liabilities, like the PFI project, which don't appear on the balance sheet.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"We've got to look at existing public spending. We're not going to proceed with the ID card scheme, so that will free up billions that could be used elsewhere. But the point is: even if you don't change tax burdens, you can change tax reforms. I'm interested in seeing a lower corporate tax.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"We've got to look at everything individually. As a general rule, we need a system to encourage better attitudes towards the environment. I'm a details man, and so, for example, I think that with airport taxes, it's not a good idea to jack up industry ticket levies. That way, we won't have things like ghost flights needed to meet quotas.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"In the long term, it needs to be lower than where it is now. We need to look at the international economy, because Britain is becoming less competitive.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"We have gained from being members. As a democrat, I think that the EU has lost its way, becoming an elite club who say: 'We know what's best for you and how to spend your money.' The EU needs a fundamental rethink, but it's already changing. We have a new dynamic with the central countries \u2013 like the Czech Rep, who don't subscribe to the Franco-German model of Europe. But I hope and believe that a more flexible Europe is achievable. I'm also an advocate of Turkey joining the EU.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"At the moment, there is a disincentive to marry and there are a lot of kids growing up without a male role model. But there's no silver bullet to counter these problems. I'd suggest, as one of the tax reforms, we could have transferable tax allowances \u2013 which, without wanting to be moralistic \u2013 I'd be happy to extend to same-sex marriages. Furthermore, if one partner has to look after children while the other parent is at work, their allowance can be transferred to the working partner.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Certainly \u2013 to 22 weeks. It's now clear that life can be sustained below 24 weeks. I don't take an extremist view and usually have a pro-life perspective, but medical development has moved on.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Johnny McDevitt</strong></p>",
  "<p>In 1962, at the height of the cold war, a young GI called James Joseph Dresnok picked up his gun and crossed the most heavily fortified border in the world to defect to the communist state of North Korea. He has been there ever since, living in the capital Pyongyang, although at one time both the North Koreans and the Americans denied he even existed.</p> <p>\"Comrade Joe\", as he is also known, is still regarded as a traitor in the United States and by the American soldiers who had to listen to his disembodied Tannoy broadcasts across the demilitarised zone promising better rations and women to those who cared to join him across the border. </p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dresnok is wary of western journalists, but agreed to an interview following a request from the Labour MEP Glyn Ford, who has been engaged in diplomacy between North and South Korea and Japan for more than a decade. We meet in a wood-panelled room, underneath pictures of Great Leader Kim Il-sung and Dear Leader Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang's futuristic Koryo Hotel. Physically, Dresnok is a big man. His teeth are framed by a gold brace, and he sports a Great Leader badge, as do all North Koreans. At 67 he still smokes three packs a day despite a serious heart condition and warnings from his doctor at Pyongyang's Friendship Hospital. </p> <p>He has never seen himself as a traitor, he says, but was simply escaping to something he believed would give him purpose. His brief army career had been chequered and undistinguished. Having escaped an unhappy childhood of foster homes in Virginia, he enlisted in 1958, the day after his 17th birthday. He served first in Germany. After what he calls \"one minor offence\", he was treated harshly. \"I was forced to clean an armoured truck with a toothbrush and bucket of water. It was 42 below zero. That's when I first thought of crossing to a communist country. But if you went to the DDR (East Germany) they interrogated you and sent you back.\" </p> <p>He got his opportunity later, when serving with his unit along the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea in 1960. His wife had decided to leave him for another man after his two-year posting in Germany, which \"made me not care about my life,\" he says. \"I wanted to go to the most dangerous place in the world.\" </p> <p>There was nothing to keep him in the army, or in America. \"I didn't have any relatives back home, my wife had left me, I didn't have anything to live for in the US,\" Dresnok says. On the day he defected he faced a possible court martial for having absconded from his base. He had gone off limits having forged his officer's signature to go and meet a Korean woman he had become attached to. \"He [the officer] said, 'I want to see you at 3pm'. I said, 'We'll see'. That's when I made my decision to cross. I'm going for a new life. I grabbed a shotgun and headed for the DMZ [the demilitarised zone]. Sure, I knew about the personnel mines, maybe I could lose a foot or a leg - but I just went, straight.</p> <p>\"A cry went up, 'Hey Dresnok, stop!' So I just fired off a round to scare them. I have no regrets.\"</p> <p>When Dresnok crossed the border he was captured by a soldier from the Korean People's Army, who later volunteered, \"I wanted to kill the American bastard!\" He was taken to Pyongyang, where he was introduced to another defector, Private Larry Abshier. Over the next 18 months they were joined by two others, Army Sergeant Robert Jenkins and Specialist Jerry Parrish, presenting a remarkable propaganda victory for the hard-line regime of Kim Il-sung.</p> <p>\"Why should I regret crossing? I don't regret nothing,\" says Dresnok. Throughout the interview, his long-time North Korean minder sits beside him, noting down his answers. Dresnok appears loyal: \"The Great Leader Kim Il-sung told us, 'I am going to take you along with us to communism.' I didn't know then that the Great Leader would take good care of us like he did.\" But those early years were tough, he says. \"When I first came here, I didn't feel so good. People would say, 'There's that American bastard!'\" The Korean war, one of the most brutal conflicts of the last century, left an estimated four million dead, and a country shattered and divided to this day. \"People here, see, were educated to hate American imperialism. All that bombing! How many did they slaughter? They killed Koreans like savages. Of course people are going to hate Americans.\" </p> <p>In a mesmerising 2007 documentary, Crossing the Line, it was revealed that in 1966 Dresnok and fellow defectors Abshier, Parrish and Jenkins became so desperate to leave the North, they managed to get to the Soviet embassy and demand asylum. The Russians promptly handed them back. While Dresnok talks of the months and years of living quietly, learning the language, reading the works of the Great Leader, it was perhaps no accident that all four defectors managed around this time to find female companions. It seems entirely plausible that the women were found for them by the state, although none of the defectors ever admitted to any such arrangements. Dresnok has been married twice in North Korea; his first wife, a mysterious Romanian who always refused to talk of her past to Dresnok, died. He has since married the daughter of a former Togolese diplomat and a Korean. One of his three sons from his two Korean marriages looks American, although he doesn't sound it; a child of the revolution, James hopes to become a North Korean diplomat.</p> <p>\"I don't consider myself a traitor,\" Dresnok explains, referring to the country he turned his back on nearly half a century ago. \"I love my country. I love my town. In his teachings, Kim Il-sung wrote; 'Those who really love their country and their home can become communists.' I'm not a communist, but I would like to be one.\" </p> <p>Dresnok describes himself as a citizen of Pyongyang. \"I call it my country because I have been here for 46 years. My life is here. Enough? The government will take care of me until my dying breath.\" So would he like to return to the US? \"I tell you, yes; I must be honest to you. I would like to see the place. But how can I go there and dance in front of the American government, when they are arming South Korea?\" Dresnok knows that he would be arrested on arrival, as was Jenkins, when he returned to the west in 2004. There is no love lost between Dresnok and Jenkins, who recanted on his return just over three years ago, denounced Dresnok and was granted clemency after only 30 days in the clink. Were he ever to leave North Korea, Dresnok is unlikely to get off so lightly, having been painted as the ringleader by Jenkins. Abshier and Parrish both died in North Korea, where their families remain.</p> <p>But it is Dresnok's extraordinary career swap, from lowly US army private to star of the North Korean silver screen that provides the most surreal twist to his story. For three years from 1978, in a 20-part series called Nameless Heroes, directed by Kim Jong-il, Dresnok played the evil American. Ironically, these roles finally established the defectors' revolutionary credentials, and they were forgiven earlier misdemeanours. \"Comrade Kim Jong-il was then in the film industry. He was making movies,\" Dresnok recalls. \"He gave a teaching for us to take part in a film.\" (Dresnok is the first to admit that he is not an educated man, and that his grammar is sometimes mangled. </p> <p>\"I want my children to be more than an illiterate old man,\" he says disarmingly.) \"To be honest I was quaking in my shoes. I never thought I could be an actor.\" What critics would make of Comrade Joe Dresnok the actor is anyone's guess. But he made an impression on Kim Jong-il, now the ruler of North Korea. \"The Dear Leader takes care of me. Great man. Did you know hospitalisation is free in the DPRK?\"</p> <p>Despite the minder, at no point during the interview does Dresnok appear under duress. He smiles frequently, only becoming emotional when speaking bitterly of that \"cunning son of a bitch, Jenkins\". </p> <p>North Korea came into being 60 years ago today and since then predictions of its demise have been as frequent as they have been premature. Now history is once again threatening to repeat itself as the North prepares to rebuild its partially dismantled nuclear programme, in protest at the refusal of the US to remove it from the list of \"state sponsors of terror\". I ask Dresnok if he can explain why the US and Vietnam have long ago made up, but relations between the US and North Korea remain in deep freeze. \"It's long-time history,\" the unrepentant defector begins. \"The US planned to use North Korea as a stepping stone to China and Russia.\" And, he continues, \"The US is afraid right now. You know why? Now we have the nuclear bomb here. They don't want 'I blow you if you blow me'. But that is what will happen if they pull the trigger.\"</p> <p>And with that Comrade Joe prepares to return to his apartment, where his wife and children are waiting. It is illegal to listen to foreign broadcasts, but as he gets up Dresnok offers his opinion on the US election: \"I'm told McCain will get it.\" Dresnok, the last American defector, relic of a cold war that never came to an end on the Korean peninsula, a man whose impulsive decision either cost him 46 years of freedom, or gave him a better life than he had before, walks out and lights a cigarette.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Joe Dresnok, the Last American Defector, will be on Al Jazeera English today.</p>",
  "<p>Piled up next to the road were bicycles and benches, rolled up mattresses and squawking chickens, radios with wonky antennas, battered suitcases and yellow jerry cans. Amid it all, wearing an oversized blue blazer and plastic sandals, sat 85-year-old Michael Bihonzi. With a walking stick in one hand and a floppy hat in the other, he stared at the green hills he had long given up hope of ever seeing again. </p> <p>More than three decades had passed since Bihonzi fled ethnic massacres in Burundi that left up to 200,000 people dead. In a Tanzanian refugee camp he found safety and peace, but not in his heart. So when offered the chance to return home for the first time since 1972, Bihonzi did not hesitate to climb on a truck with 23 of his children and grandchildren and cross the border. </p> <p>\"I have come to reclaim my land,\" he said after his arrival in the southern Makamba province, while waiting for another truck to take him to the village where he grew up. \"And then I can die.\"</p> <p>Bihonzi's homecoming is a part of a final repatriation of refugees to a country that at last appears destined for a definitive peace. Nearly a tenth of Burundi's 8 million people fled between 1972 and 2003, a period of \"slow genocide\" where the ruling Tutsi elite used force to suppress the Hutu majority, eventually triggering all-out civil war. </p> <p>But over the past five years stability has steadily increased. With mediation efforts led by South Africa and Tanzania - Burundi is one country where \"an African solution to an African problem\" has worked - the fighting has all but stopped. </p> <p>More than 450,000 refugees have already returned. Now, with the last active rebel group in Burundi, the Forces for National Liberation, showing willingness to lay down its arms and join President Pierre Nkurunziza's government, Tanzania is closing the remaining refugee camps near its western border that still housed 320,000 Burundians at the beginning of the year. </p> <p>About 90,000 of them had fled Burundi during the 1990s, and now are arriving home at the rate of several thousand a week. The other 220,000 asylum seekers - the so-called \"1972 refugees\" - were given a chance to stay. The Tanzanian government said they could be naturalised, an offer whose scale may be unprecedented in Africa. But 46,000 people, including Bihonzi's family, chose instead to accept a \u00a323 cash grant from the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), which is managing the repatriation effort, load up to 100kg (220lb) of possessions on a truck, and go home. </p> <p>\"Coming back takes a lot of guts because they were fine in Tanzania and reintegration is difficult,\" said William Mututa, UNCHR's office head in Makamba. \"But most say, 'We love our country' and that their problems will be sorted out in time.\"</p> <p>The problems are many. Burundi has a shattered economy and the lowest per capita gross national income in sub-Saharan Africa. Outside the main towns, most people rely on subsistence farming. But the hills are densely populated, and competition for land is intense. </p> <p>Many of the 1972 refugees returning to their old villages are finding the land that was once theirs is occupied. Established late last year, the state-run Land and Other Properties Commission, which helps returning refugees recover their assets, has already registered more than 10,000 land and 18,000 property conflicts. </p> <p>Katebo Ngarama, 62, is one of the claimants. He abandoned his family home in Nyanza Lac, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, in 1972 when, in response to a Hutu insurrection, the Tutsi-dominated army began slaughtering all Hutus with even a basic education. Fleeing on foot, Ngarama took with him his wife, his parents and two pairs of trousers. </p> <p>Like most Burundians at the time, Ngarama's father did not have a title deed. When Ngarama arrived home in May, the family now using his land angrily refused to move. For a few weeks he feared for his safety - one returning refugee was savagely attacked when he pitched tent on his former plot. Now, however, Ngaramba is on speaking terms with the family on his land, and is considering offering them half the plot to settle the dispute. If resolved amicably, it will be a good omen for his children, who were all born in Tanzania, and are the main reason that he returned.</p> <p>\"I always dreamed of coming back to show them that this is their country too,\" Ngarama said. \"They can decide for themselves if it is bad or good.\"</p> <p>Other returning refugees, especially those who fled when they were young, have no claim to land, and no idea of where their home villages are. For now they are being housed in corrugated iron shelters in temporary camps in southern Burundi. </p> <p>The authorities have promised to build them houses, with the help of the UN, and there is even talk of building entire villages for the landless. But the plans are moving slowly. Already the promises of free healthcare and schooling made by government officials who visited the camps in Tanzania last year are sounding a bit hollow to some. </p> <p>At the Gitara temporary camp, on the edge of a dirt road cutting through the hills of Makamba, Isaie Niyongabo, his wife and six children were among the 50 families who have been awaiting housing since March. The government had given them clothing and rice, but they were eager to start a more normal life.</p> <p>\"Our children need to go to school,\" said Niyongabo, who left Burundi when he was nine. \"They need to learn to speak Kirundi and French, not just English and Swahili like in Tanzania.\"</p> <p>In their decades outside the country, many of the refugees have managed to temper their anger over their forced exile, and now talk vaguely of \"the war\" or \"the trouble\" that drove them away. But for some the homecoming has made forgetting impossible. Francois Nyabenda has his house back but must also each morning walk past the banana grove where his father and brother were murdered. It was difficult to deal with, he said, but so far he had no regrets about leaving Tanzania. Neither did Eliphas Cubwa, 73, who returned last month to Nyanza Lac after 36 years away. </p> <p>\"When you live in another country which is not yours you live like a slave,\" he said. \"It is not your grandparents' country.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>For most of Burundi's post-colonial history, political and military power was in the hands of an elite from the <strong>Tutsi </strong>ethnic group, who make up <strong>14% </strong>of the population, compared with the <strong>85% </strong>who are <strong>Hutu</strong>. In <strong>2005</strong>, after the signing of a <strong>peace agreement </strong>to end more than a decade of civil war, former Hutu rebel leader <strong>Pierre Nkurunziza </strong>was elected president. <strong>Power-sharing </strong>is now enshrined in the constitution, with a <strong>60:40 split </strong>between Hutus and Tutsis. The last remaining rebel movement, the <strong>FNL</strong>, is Hutu-based, like the ruling party, and some believe political dynamics have fundamentally changed from the pre-2005 days.</p>",
  "<p>A three-year-old girl sucked into a hidden storm drain as she played in a park was forced for 70 metres through an underground concrete pipe before her father leapt into a swollen river to save her.</p> <p>The storm drain was so narrow that Leona Baxter's face, arms and legs were scraped raw. Squashed and drowning, she smashed into a rock in the tunnel, and was then spat into the river Wear, at Chester-le-Street, County Durham, along with her pet mastiff Brophy.</p> <p>Emergency services last night praised the girl's father Mark Baxter, a 34-year-old RAF sergeant, for \"incredibly quick thinking\" which saved her life on Sunday evening. After scrabbling vainly at the drain's displaced metal cover, he ran to the river and grabbed the child just as currents were about to carry her away. The dog did not survive.</p> <p>\"The kids had their wellies on and were really enjoying splashing around,\" he said yesterday, as fire crews warned of more rain tomorrow across most of the country. </p> <p>He and his wife Beverley, a hotel receptionist at Scotch Corner on the A1, had offered Leona, her six-year-old sister Kia and Brophy a run-around after visiting the children's great-grandparents at Chester-le-Street.</p> <p>\"I threw a stick for the dog and then I heard Bev shout \"Leona.\" I looked around for her and saw Leona wasn't there. There was nothing,\" he said. \"That's when I noticed there was a swirling whirlpool effect. </p> <p>\"I stuck my arm in but I couldn't feel anything. Then I heard Bev cry out and looked up to see the dog being sucked down the same hole.\"</p> <p>While a passerby dialed 999, Baxter thought: it's a storm drain of some kind and if it's going to spill out somewhere it would be in the river. He ran to the Wear and saw what looked like the child's coat being dragged away.</p> <p>\"I realised she was in it. She was floating face down in the river,\" he said. \"I leapt over the side and grabbed her. The water was about up to my shoulder height. She was completely still and wasn't breathing.\" </p> <p>He managed to hand the child to his wife who started first aid and Leona coughed, cried and was violently sick, spewing out water. Exhausted and with his boots waterlogged, Baxter clung on to the riverbank for the three minutes it took for a fire crew, paramedics and police to arrive.</p> <p>Firefighter Steve Hagar, who was one of the first on the scene, said: \"If there'd been a grate on the other end of the pipe or the girl had been a bit bigger she would have been stuck underground. Both she and her dad are lucky to be alive.\"</p> <p>Safety officers immediately checked other drains in Riverside Park. </p> <p>Baxter said that Leona, who is recovering in the University Hospital of North Durham, remembered most of her ordeal. He said: \"She was trying to do a star float but couldn't because she was 'squashed'. She said, 'I couldn't do them daddy because I was stuck in a tunnel'.</p> <p>\"She banged her head on a rock in the tunnel. There was no space and the force of the water knocked any swimming out. I don't know if the dog barrelled through and helped her. At the time, I didn't want to think about my daughter going through that. I just thought, 'Where will it go? It can only go to the river - it isn't designed for anything else.'\"</p> <p>Beverley said: \"I really am proud of him. We feel like the luckiest parents alive. We've still got our family.\" She said that Leona was on antibiotics and would be in hospital for a few more days, but was clearly improving. She had asked for ice-cream and chocolate.</p> <p>Rainfall of up to 30mm was predicted for today and tomorrow by the Met Office, with the worst weather likely in western areas. \"That's clearly not going to be very helpful given the large amount of rain we have already seen this month,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>\"It's an early prediction but arguably it's angling to be one of the wettest Septembers ever.\"</p> <p>Last night 23 flood warnings were shared by the north-east and the Severn valley between Shrewsbury and Gloucester. The historic Abbey in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, which came to symbolise last year's floods, was once again surrounded by water. </p> <p>The inquiry into Friday's devastating floods in Morpeth, where repairs are estimated at over \u00a31m, continued with claims that new defence \"pillows\", designed to absorb water and become like a sandbag, had floated uselessly away. </p> <p>The floods minister John Healey toured the town, where 1,000 properties were evacuated at the height of the floods, and said that the government was determined to help Morpeth \"get on its feet as soon as possible\".</p> <p>South Wales police promised a crackdown on thieves who have targeted elderly people following the floods. Several cases have been reported in Tonypandy and Hirwan of intruders stealing cash after gaining entry to pensioners' homes by saying that they needed to check equipment after the heavy rainfall.</p>",
  "<p>Top-up fees, academic standards - now a further headache awaits university chiefs when they meet this week: the considerable extra burdens about to be placed upon the sector by the demands of the Home Office, through the UK Border Agency.</p> <p>In July, the UKBA announced that by the end of this year students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) would no longer be able to enter the UK to study wherever they please. Instead, visas will only be granted for study at named institutions licensed by the UKBA. Universities and colleges will be required to \"sponsor\" students to whom they wish visas to be issued. </p> <p>How many of the vice-chancellors gathering at Cambridge, I wonder, have actually read the UKBA's Guidance for Sponsor Applications (130 pages)? Or even the more specific Students under the Points Based System (a meagre 26 pages)? Those who have will know that the licence application process amounts to much more than a mere transitory bureaucratic chore. </p> <p>Once granted a licence, a university will enjoy the benefits of access to the UKBA's \"sponsorship management system ... an online tool that allows the sponsor to undertake its day-to-day activities under sponsorship\". An \"authorising officer\" will need to be appointed - the task cannot be contracted out. Other appointments will also need to be made.</p> <p>Once a \"sponsored\" student is admitted to the UK, the sponsoring institution will need to be ready, at virtually a moment's notice, to assure the UKBA that he or she is diligently following the prescribed course of study. The institution will be obliged \"to report where the student fails to enrol or stops attending\". British universities have rarely needed to complete student attendance registers in the past. But they will clearly need to do so in future. </p> <p>The UKBA's Sponsoring Licence Unit promises to carry out \"quality assurance checks\" in relation to applications for visas and post-visa attendance requirements. Should these checks reveal some serious deficiency (for example, asking for a visa to admit a student to a non-existent course) there will certainly be further inquiries. Ultimately a licence could be revoked. Where this happens we are assured that the institution will be named and shamed on the UKBA website, and there is even the possibility that a chief executive could face criminal charges and imprisonment.</p> <p>Omitted from this litany are the special provisions that will apply to collaborative arrangements that universities enter into with UK-based private teaching establishments. These collaborative arrangements are often highly innovative and, when well-managed, provide a rich addition to a university's portfolio of taught programmes. They have also become an important element in the widening participation agenda and they form a significant non-taxpayer-funded income stream. Universities accredit such establishments and then, under the umbrella of that accreditation, validate discrete programmes of study. In most (but not all) cases, students enrolled on such programmes are, legally, students of the \"parent\" accrediting university, which alone can enrol them onto the validated programmes.</p> <p>The UKBA seems unsure of itself in this area. It seems to me not to have grasped the significance of such accreditation, and, as I read the documentation, it wants to require such partner establishments to undergo a quite unnecessary further accreditation. There is - or ought to be - no need for such an extra burden, since such arrangements are routinely audited by the Quality Assurance Agency.</p> <p>And talking of the QAA, the UKBA has made it clear that an institution that has obtained a verdict from the QAA of no confidence will be precluded automatically from obtaining a licence to sponsor visa applications under the new rules. At the moment, there is no true \"appeal\" against such a verdict, only a \"representation\" against auditors' findings. The QAA will no doubt wish to consider its procedures afresh in this sensitive area of its work.</p> <p>All in all, the UKBA's new rules look set to make a significant increase in the bureaucratic burden on our universities. While no one doubts the necessity to stamp on bogus educational institutions and bogus students, the proposed new arrangements would benefit from a rapid, informed reappraisal.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Geoffrey Alderman is Michael Gross professor of politics and contemporary history at the University of Buckingham</p>",

  "<p>On the drive back to my home in New Orleans from an evacuation in Memphis, Tennessee ahead of Hurricane Gustav, I listened as one caller after another on <a href=\"http://www.wrno.com/main.html\">New Orleans radio station 99.5</a> - better known as \"Rush Radio\", as in the iconic conservative talker Limbaugh - exhorted New Orleanians to refrain from criticising the city and state governments for their minimal assistance to their citizens, which amounted to little more than shipping the poorest members of their community to Memphis on buses and in trains. </p> <p>New Orleanians, we were told by Rush Radio's listeners, should become heartier, more self-sufficient folk who do not expect any help from the government, even during a genuine emergency such as a hurricane. </p> <p>Talk radio, of course, is a forum where anti-government rhetoric reigns supreme and empathy for one's fellow man is rarely expressed. But it was nonetheless stunning to hear New Orleanians proudly proclaim that a city government that provides essential services to the public was not desirable and, worse, that those who expected the government to work on their behalf were lazy layabouts deserving of whatever fate the storm doled out to them. </p> <p>Hurricane Gustav, after all, was such a huge trauma not because a well-cared-for citizenry had become complacent in the three years since the levees broke during Hurricane Katrina but because New Orleans never really recovered from Katrina in the first place. Since the failure of the federal levees in 2005 - in New Orleans, this is the preferred manner of describing what happened back then, as the word \"hurricane\" implies a natural disaster, which the levee breaks were certainly not - New Orleans has endured an excruciating non-recovery. The state run <a href=\"http://www.road2la.org\">Road Home programme</a>, meant to give grants to homeowners, is a Kafka-esque failure. As of August 30, just as Gustav was bearing down on New Orleans, only <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/us/31road.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">39,000 New Orleanians had received Road Home grants</a>. Late August also brought news via the Greater New Orleans Community Data Centre that New Orleans <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/08/no_blight_easily_tops_that_fou.html\">leads the nation in blight</a>.</p> <p>Excluding the mostly smooth evacuation before the storm, Gustav has been a continuation of the dysfunction seen during Katrina and its aftermath. New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin made exaggerated claims about the size of storm. He claimed that Gustav was a 900-mile-wide <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/31/2351178.htm\">\"mother of all storms\"</a> when in fact the <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Centre</a> reported that Gustav's diameter of tropical storm force was about 320 miles across, about 80% as wide as the 440-mile-wide region of tropical-storm-force winds that Hurricane Katrina had at landfall).</p> <p>Much worse, the city's <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5980485.html\">re-entry process</a> late last week that was a confusing, infuriating mess. At the outset, the city announced a tiered re-entry process whereby first-responders, followed by so-called \"recovery support\" - defined very loosely and confusingly by the city as \"major employers or businesses that are essential to the return of residents and the city's economic viability\" - would be allowed back beyond the city limits first. But the city scuttled the re-entry plan when New Orleanians - their memories fresh of being kept from the city for weeks post Katrina and furious that they could be classified as \"third tier\" after having endured the non-recovery since 2005 - howled at having their return delayed. </p> <p>Now that I'm back home in New Orleans, I'm watching friends and neighbours begin the task of another post-storm recovery. Publicly assisted evacuees returning home have described poor living conditions in shelters, only to be told that they should be grateful for receiving any assistance from the government (one commenter on the Times Picayune's website blasted the complaints as coming from a <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2008/09/publicly_assisted_evacuees_in.html\">\"bottomless pit of entitlement\"</a>). And Fema is reprising its inept Katrina performance (Fema officials promised Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal that they would have 160 trucks delivering essentials such as bags of ice and MREs to the state, but only <a href=\"http://nola.live.advance.net/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-6/1220679621181320.xml&amp;coll=1\">45 showed up</a>).</p> <p>I can't help but think of Nagin's warning to the city just before Gustav made landfall: You're on your own. Nagin was speaking to those who had decided to ignore the evacuation warnings and hunker down in their homes to ride out the storm - but he inadvertently described the philosophy of governance that of New Orleanians have suffered from state, local and federal governments since Katrina.</p>",
  "<p>Labour MP Frank Field's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/08/immigrationpolicy.eu\">new proposal</a> for \"balanced migration\" is many things, but it certainly isn't balanced. A \"one-in/one-out\" immigration policy is unfair, unnecessary and unworkable \u2013 and would deal yet another blow to Britain's faltering economy. </p> <p>Field frets that Britain's \"open door\" policy will lead to a large increase in the settled UK population, which he believes is not unsustainable. He proposes instead what amounts to a temporary-worker scheme, policed by employers. Foreigners could work here for up to four years, but would then be sent packing. Businesses that failed to produce evidence that their foreign workers had left the country would be denied future work visas. There would be a strict quota \u2013 perhaps 20,000, including dependants \u2013 on the number of non-EU workers able to gain permanent residency, selected on the basis of their skills as reflected in their salary.</p> <p>Field's proposal, cobbled together with Tory MP Nicholas Soames and the swivel-eyed xenophobes at <a href=\"http://www.migrationwatchuk.com/\">MigrationWatch</a>, is utterly misconceived. For a start, Britain does not have an \"open-door\" immigration policy: while people from within the EU can come and work here freely, those from outside the EU, which the Field-Soames proposal would target, cannot. The door is already slammed shut for all but the most highly skilled non-Europeans. </p> <p>Second, as I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/05/thecrowdedhousefallacy\">have written previously</a>, it is a fallacy that Britain's population is destined to rise inexorably. The recent increase in immigration is largely temporary, and is already reversing itself: as the pound plummets and the economy teeters on the brink of recession, Britain is far less attractive to foreign workers. But, in any case, since when are other people such a bad thing? If having more people around is so terrible, why isn't Frank Field suggesting that densely populated cities such as London, Birmingham and Glasgow prevent people from the rest of the country from settling there?<br> Even if one accepts that stabilising the population is desirable, Field's proposal would not necessarily do so. Preventing most temporary non-EU workers from settling permanently would not limit entry from the EU, or keep out asylum-seekers, clandestine migrants, visa overstayers, and those entering on family reunification visas; nor, indeed, would it prevent Britons from having more babies and living longer. Indeed, if large numbers of Britons stopped emigrating, stabilising the population would require expelling existing migrants. </p> <p>While the suggestion that employers should be able to hire the foreign employees they need has some merit, forcing most of those still here after four years to leave does not. After all, if their employers would rather they remained, these migrants are clearly contributing to the economy and society as a whole. Throwing them out would deprive Britain not only of the skills with which they arrived, but also of those they have acquired while living and working here. As an Arsenal fan, I don't want Kolo Tour\u00e9 chucked out, and I'm sure Portsmouth fans would be loath to see Kanu go, too. </p> <p>What's more, making it much harder for skilled workers to stay on is Britain is hardly conducive to attracting them in the first place. Talented people increasingly have a choice about where to work; and with Australia, Canada and other countries wooing them assiduously, making them feel unwelcome here is tantamount to shooting our hobbling economy in the foot. </p> <p>Common sense also suggests, and international experience in the US and elsewhere confirms, that businesses are hardly equipped to enforce immigration policy. At the same time, if workers would only allowed to stay in the country on their employers' say so, they would be far more vulnerable to exploitation.</p> <p>But perhaps the worst thing about the proposal is that the select few who would be allowed to settle in Britain would be the rich and the highly educated. Most likely, they would be American investment bankers and Russian billionaires rather than Asian acupuncturists or African nurses. That is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/08/immigrationpolicy.immigration\">hardly fair or progressive</a>. Frank Field should think again.<br></p>",

  "<h2>Abdulla Ahmed Ali</h2> <p>In Abdulla Ahmed Ali's martyrdom video he described himself as the leader of the \"blessed\" operation. The 27-year-old, also known as Ahmed Ali Khan, was the only one of the three plot leaders who intended to die, the court heard.</p> <p>He claimed he was merely planning a small explosion to draw attention to a documentary he was making to protest against western foreign policy. His parents moved to Britain in the 1960s from Pakistan. He was one of eight children, five of them boys. In the 1980s the family went to Pakistan for six years before returning to east London in 1987.</p> <p>In court, Ali recalled seeing images of \"concentration camps\" in Bosnia when he was 15 or 16 and being \"aware they were Muslims\". In his suicide video, Ali said that he had aspired to martyrdom since the age of 15.</p> <p>He studied computer systems engineering. At university he became actively involved in politics, joining demonstrations and handing out leaflets. <br>After graduating he began volunteering with an Islamic charity in east London. In January 2003 he travelled to a refugee camp for Afghans in Pakistan, where he felt \"emotions that I had not felt before\".</p> <h2>Assad Sarwar</h2> <p>Assad Sarwar, 28 and married, was said by the prosecution to be the quartermaster of the plot, purchasing and storing bomb-making materials, with terrorist ambitions that were \"limitless\". </p> <p>He was \"too precious\" for the cause and so was not intended to die in the airline bomb plot, hence the absence of a martyrdom recording by him, the court heard. But he claimed he was not involved in a terrorist plot and described al-Qaida as \"deviant\" in court.</p> <p>After dropping out of Brunel University, Sarwar met co-accused Abdulla Ahmed Ali while doing charity work in Pakistan with the Islamic Medical Association in late 2002. They visited refugee camps housing Afghans who had fled the US invasion of their country. </p> <p>He returned to Britain in May 2003 and drifted through two further short term jobs as a postman with Royal Mail and for BT. He said he met up with Ali again who he described as having \"leading characteristics\", compared to his own \"weak character\", in 2003 and again in 2006 at lectures in east London. <br>In between, Sarwar returned to Pakistan for two months in October 2005 aiding survivors of the earthquake in Kashmir. </p> <p>Sarwar said in 2006 Ali invited him back to his flat and they chatted about UK foreign policy before hitting upon the idea of a \"publicity stunt\". He told the court that al Qaida was \"deviant\" and that according to his beliefs suicide bombers would end up \"in hell fire\".</p> <p>But the prosecution alleged he had links with terror chiefs in Pakistan. Sarwar claimed detailed flight lists found on a computer memory-stick at his home were just \"holiday destinations in America\". The memory stick also had information on improvised bombs, attacking aircraft, details of the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl, and information on British nuclear power stations.</p> <h2>Tanvir Hussain</h2> <p>Tanvir Hussain, 27, from Leyton, east London, was described as a gifted sportsman by Abdulla Ahmed Ali, whom he met while studying for his A-levels at Waltham Forest college.</p> <p>Hussain later went to Middlesex University, where he took a business and computers course. He told the court he regularly drank and took drugs while a student and he had a reputation as a womaniser.</p> <p>He worked in a sexual health clinic for a while. Later, he became a devout Muslim - former colleagues described him as showing signs of extremism - and developed into becoming Ali's right-hand man.</p> <p>He spent hours with Ali at the Forest Road bomb factory and was followed by surveillance teams as he bought essential items for the plot, including surgical needles and syringes.</p> <p>Hussain was living with his parents, brothers and sister when he was arrested. The family had moved down to London from Blackburn when he was a child. In his martyrdom video, Hussain, a part-time postman, said: \"People are going to die, but it's worth the price.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's hard to reconcile Conservative party claims that the Labour government is still too cuddly with the trade unions when you step into the auditorium of the TUC congress.</p> <p>Today is day one of the four-day conference in Brighton and this afternoon unions have been debating the perennial motions about better employment and trade union rights. Gordon Brown and his fellow ministers have already said, more than once, that Labour is not prepared to go back to the 1970s, in a clear nod to the famous winter of discontent that brought the Callaghan government down and paved the way for 18 years of Tory rule.</p> <p>But talk to the unions and they will point out that they remain the most restricted and regulated organisations in the UK, which is why they are ignoring Brown's refusal to put things right and pushing through a repeat list of demands. A composite motion on employment rights outlines the unions' dismay at the government's failure to return trade union freedoms.</p> <p>The trade union freedom bill, tabled by Labour MP John McDonnell, sought to introduce better protection for workers taking industrial action from victimisation and dismissal. It also attempted to cut the red tape that sees unions hampered from taking industrial action for failing to cross every of the many \"t\"s when running ballots. The claim is that the number of technicalities that companies can cite to block industrial action skewers the democratic process. Finally, the bill also tried to introduce the right of unions to take supportive action - otherwise known as secondary action - as outsourcing becomes an increasingly popular feature of the modern workplace. </p> <p>Under current laws, if some of your colleagues are the subjects of an outsourcing exercise and see their terms and conditions drop as a result, there is nothing fellow trade unionists in the company can do about it. All the bill sought to do was maintain the workplace unity by allowing them to do so. You can see how the current state of affairs could encourage a company with strong union tendencies to outsource more and thereby weaken the workers' voice. While many in the union movement criticise the bill as mouselike in its demands, it is still too much for a 21st century Labour government to stomach.</p> <p>Brown's refusal to back the bill isn't the only gripe aired by unions today. They are also seriously concerned by a series of recent decisions made in the European court of justice that put market freedom above social and employment rights. For example, decisions have been made that have in effect outlawed the right to strike where unions are trying to win equal pay for migrant workers, and banned public bodies from requiring foreign contractors to pay such workers local rates. The ECJ's rulings mean that, while EC law protects the fundamental right to strike, action needs to be justified since it conflicts with the economic freedom of employers. </p> <p>The UK's trade unions fear employers could now exploit the uncertainty around EU law to threaten litigation in British courts, making collection action risky.</p> <p>This state of affairs has offset unions' obvious relief that the government has finally come round - at least to a large extent - on equal rights for agency and temporary workers, following a tripartite meeting with the Confederation of British Industry earlier this year. </p> <p>Unions hope that the EU agency workers' directive will finally be passed later this year under the French presidency. </p> <p>With near to 7 million members, the union movement is at just over half its heyday strength of the 1970s, and in the fevered atmosphere of a Labour leadership in trouble, union leaders are starting to warn that if Brown doesn't start to make more concessions, and soon, members might be tempted to vote Conservative. Of course, many already do, but not as many as David Cameron would like. </p> <p>His trade union envoy, Richard Balfe, will be mixing with union delegates this week, as he seeks to forge a rapprochement between trade unionists and the modern Conservative party.<br> It's unlikely that Balfe, a former Labour MEP who switched to the blue corner, will be reporting back to the Tory leader that there was much canoodling going on between trade union leaders and the prime minister when they meet up for the congress dinner tomorrow night. </p>",
  "<h2>Uganda</h2> <p>The death toll from an outbreak of <strong><a ref=\"http://www.afrol.com/articles/30649\">hepatitis E in northern Uganda</a></strong> has reached 123, following the deaths of nine more people over the past two weeks.</p> <p>According to the director for clinical services in the Ministry of Health, Kenya Mugisha, the number of people now infected is 7,757.</p> <p>The spread of the disease has been fuelled by poor sanitation at refugee camps, still home to many people in the north displaced by the Lords Resistance Army.</p> <p>The outbreak began in Kitgum district in October last year, but has spread to Gulu, Pader and Yumbe.</p> <p>The disease is spread through the consumption of food and drink contaminated with faeces.</p> <p>The government has launched a hygiene awareness campaign around internally displaced person's camps and has pledged to construct boreholes and pit latrines to help counter the problem.</p> <p>According to a report in The Monitor newspaper, 76% of diseases in Uganda are caused by poor hygiene and sanitation.</p> <p>Mugisha said if everyone disposed on human waste properly, they would not suffer from diseases like hepatitis E, cholera and dysentery.</p> <p>Some 70% of the deaths from hepatitis E have been pregnant women, according to the World Health Organisation, which is supporting the government to reduce the infection rate.</p> <p>* The country's cotton fields may be saved from pestilence thanks to a <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200809040426.html\"><br>trap invented by a Ugandan scientist</a></strong>, the New Vision reports. </p> <p>Dr Ben Ssekamatte's anti-bollworm trap is made up of yellow cans opened at the sides and fixed 30mm above the crop.</p> <p>The bright cans attract the worms, which are then caught in a sticky substance made of molasses and water. </p> <p>Because the worms are attracted to the colour yellow, some farmers plant sunflowers next to cotton to direct them away from the crop. However, Ssekamatte, the director of Bio-Consult Uganda, said this method is ineffective in the long-term, as sunflowers dry up quite quickly and soon leave the cotton unprotected.</p> <p>The trap has already been tested in Zambia. </p> <p>Uganda's cotton production has fallen from one of the highest in Africa at 476,000 bales in 1969 to just 60,000 bales last year. </p> <p>* Kalangala district government, in central Uganda, has been given <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200809040248.html\">12 motorbikes</a></strong> to enable healthcare workers to conduct door-to-door HIV counselling and testing in the fishing communities around Lake Victoria.</p> <p>The home-based HIV voluntary counselling and testing team will also hand our antiretrovirals in a bid to reduce the district's 30% infection rate.</p> <p>District health officer, Hillary Bitakalamire, told New Vision: \"Our work of sensitising communities about HIV/ Aids has always been limited by the lack of transportation to the various fishing communities in Kalangala and the neighbouring villages. And as a result, a number of people have contracted HIV because of ignorance.\"</p> <p>Money for the bikes, worth 35m Ugandan shillings (\u00a312,192), came from the US. </p> <h2>Improving aid</h2> <p>Developed and developing countries last week signed up to a series of reforms aimed at improving the way aid is given and spent.</p> <p>Concluding a <strong><a href=\"http://www.accrahlf.net/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/ACCRAEXT/0,,menuPK:64861886~pagePK:4705384~piPK:4705403~theSitePK:4700791,00.html\">three-day conference</a></strong> on aid effectiveness, held in Ghana, delegates from donor and recipient countries, aid agencies and financial institutions endorsed the Accra Agenda for Action. </p> <p>Under the agreement developing countries will have more control over what they do with the aid they receive, while donor countries will provide three to five-year plans of when they will be giving aid to recipients. How and when money is spent will be up to the recipient countries, which will also be free to buy goods and use services from wherever they can get the best quality at the lowest price.</p> <p>More than 800 people gathered in Accra for the 3rd High Level Forum last week to review the commitments made in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness signed in 2005. In Paris it was agreed, in principle, to give developing countries <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200809040244.html\">more control</a></strong> over the aid they receive. </p> <p>Critics have said that the <strong><a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=80134\">unreliability of aid</a></strong> has made it hard for developing countries to take control of money or to plan ahead. More than half the money promised in donations in the last three years never materialised, the conference heard.<br> In addition to the action plan, <strong><a href=\"http://www.afrol.com/articles/30652\">the British government</a></strong> formally signed a 10-year development partnership agreement with Ghana, which will see the African nation receiving \u00a3250m in grants over the next three years. The agreement, which sees the British government increasing its aid commitment to Ghana by 20% over the next three years, was first announced in February. The Ghanaian minister of finance and economic planning, Kwadwo Baah Wiredu, said the agreement was good news for the country as it meant that 95% of the money would be untied and could be used where needed. </p> <h2>Empowering women</h2> <p> <br>Strengthening women's physical and mental health will help development efforts throughout Africa, the director of WHO Africa told the continent's health ministers.</p> <p>At a conference in Cameroon, Luis Sambo called on governments to implement action plans to <strong><a href=\"http://www.afrol.com/articles/30641\">empower women</a></strong> in their numerous roles, providing them with better education and health facilities, reported Afrol News last week.</p> <p>Sambo added that governments should fight against discrimination and practices that violate women's human rights. A \"huge majority\" of African women are still unaware of their rights to health, education and life, he added in a report, which means they continue to be \"victims\" of genital mutilation, forced marriages and early, unwanted pregnancies. These problems, along with \"weak\" healthcare systems, all contribute to sub-Saharan Africa's high rates of death in childbirth - one woman in 26 is at risk of dying during childbirth.<br> \"Women constitute a key link in the chain of development,\" he said, adding that enhancing their overall well-being would advance Africa's progress.</p>",

  "<p>Immigration is an emotive issue. The possibilities of a rational debate are constrained as many commentators have already adopted certain positions. The latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/07/immigration.visas\">proposals</a> are to expel non-EU immigrants after four years. The proponents of such policies are happy to collect taxes from non-EU immigrants, but do not wish to extend social rights to them. Yet politicians have shown remarkable unwillingness to address economic causes of legal and illegal immigration.</p> <p>In a world of uneven economic development, many people are persuaded to leave their homes, families and friends in search of greener pastures, especially to the western world. Some immigration is encouraged as often the indigenous population is less willing to accept poorly paid jobs. Immigrants from the Mediterranean countries and Eastern Europe are increasingly providing cheap labour for the leisure, tourism and agriculture industry. Immigration helps to boost the reserve army of labour and enables some employers to make excessive profits by driving down wages and working conditions. Unsurprisingly, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) opposes any <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4474997.stm\">cap</a> and claims that immigration is essential for business<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/migrants-are-essential-for-business-growth-says-cbi-430609.html\"> growth</a>. It is silent on the social rights of immigrants.</p> <p>Immigrants often have dreams, energy and willingness to work long hours. They have revived the British textile industry and run the ubiquitous corner shop. Immigration also results in huge wealth transfer from developing countries to developed countries. The developing countries bear the cost of producing scientists, engineers, doctors and other professionals, but many then migrate to developed countries. </p> <p>The main reason for migration to the western world is that it has comparatively good education, healthcare, economic and social infrastructure. Developing countries, often rich in natural and human resources, can also develop such infrastructure but are hampered by local corruption, export of capital and organised tax avoidance. </p> <p>Due to historical legacies, developing countries are estimated to have an <a href=\"http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=2142\">external debt</a> of some US$2.85 trillion. A large part of this is due to theft by many dictators and deposited in western banks. A report by the UK <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/other_side_of_the_coin_PDF.pdf\">Africa All Party Parliament Group (pdf)</a> noted that \"\u00a3220 bn was stolen or misused by [Nigeria's] past rulers between 1960 and 1999 and much of this was held overseas\". Developing countries paid developed countries more than US$540 billion in <a href=\"http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=2142\">debt service</a> in 2005. Low-income countries continue to pay out $100 million each day to creditors.</p> <p>Developing countries are estimated to be losing an additional $350bn-$500bn a year through organised <a href=\"http://www.eurodad.org/uploadedFiles/Whats_New/Reports/factsheet_capitalflight08.pdf\">tax avoidance (pdf)</a>, often by western multinational corporations. This is more than three times the total of all foreign aid and assistance. <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/images/deathandtaxes.pdf\">Christian Aid</a> reported that tax avoidance prevents investment in social infrastructure and will lead to some 5.6m deaths of young children.</p> <p>A recent report by <a href=\"http://www.greenpeac e.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/conning-the-congo.pdf\">Greenpeace</a> noted that logging companies in Congo are avoiding taxes of at least $12m a year. The main tool for this is '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/06/12\">transfer pricing</a>', a technique used by companies to shift costs and profits. The sums are not trivial by local standards. In terms of 2000 prices, they are over 50 times the country's environmental operating budget. Some $12m is equivalent to 80% of the country's public healthcare budget and could help to vaccinate some 700,000 children under five years of age against deadly diseases.</p> <p>Altogether, developing countries are exporting nearly a trillion dollars each year to developed countries, leaving precious little for investment in education, healthcare, public administration and jobs. Is it any wonder that those who are mobile migrate to developed countries, either legally or illegally? Curbing the export of capital from developing to developed countries and greater investment in local infrastructure will go a long way towards reducing pressures for immigration. Developed countries have been slow to write off debts, or repatriate the funds looted by foreign dictators. They have done nothing to investigate and prosecute companies that avoid taxes in developing countries.</p> <p>While some immigration is a feature of the neoliberal global economy, pressures can be significantly reduced by curbing tax avoidance and creating geopolitical structures that promote more equitable share of wealth and power. Without addressing the economic inequities, there is little prospect of curbing the pressures for legal and illegal immigration.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337406195\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Hurricane Ike weakened to a category two storm today as it moved across Cuba towards the capital Havana, with its winds and storm surge destroying houses and toppling trees.</p> <p>More than 900,000 Cubans have been evacuated to shelters or higher ground in an attempt to escape the hurricane's full fury. Ike had earlier raked the Bahamas and worsened floods in Haiti, which have already killed at least 319 people.</p> <p>Ike made landfall late yesterday as a category three storm, but weakened by this morning. At 5am (10am BST) Ike had maximum sustained winds near 105mph (170kph) with the US National Hurricane Centre predicting the storm would further weaken as it moves through central Cuba today. The hurricane is likely to hit Havana early tomorrow.</p> <p>But its storm surges still threaten communities along most of the north-eastern coast of the island, which has been deluged with rain, according to Cuba's National Meteorological Institute.</p> <p>State television broadcast images of the storm surge washing over coastal homes in the eastern-most city of Baracoa. It said huge waves surged over buildings as tall as five stories and dozens of dwellings were damaged beyond repair.</p> <p>In the provincial capital of Camag\u00fcey, municipal workers boarded up banks and restaurants before heavy rain started falling. </p> <p>As the hurricane's eye passed just 20 miles (35 km) south of the town, the roaring wind blew apart some older buildings of stone and brick, leaving behind only piles of rubble.</p> <p>\"I have never seen anything like it in my life. So much force is terrifying,\" said Olga Alvarez, 70, huddling in her living room with her husband and teenage grandson. \"We barely slept last night. It was just 'boom, boom, boom'.\"</p> <p>Weather forecasters predict Ike could enter the Gulf of Mexico next, with Louisiana among the likely targets. </p> <p>The Hurricane Centre today issued a tropical storm warning for the Florida Keys. On Florida's Key West, tourists and residents were ordered to evacuate ahead of Ike's expected arrival tomorrow. </p> <p>The hurricane is forecast to make landfall later between the Florida Panhandle and the Texas coast, with New Orleans and southern Louisiana once again at risk.</p> <p>Many residents there are still returning after fleeing Gustav, a storm that in the US failed to deliver the punch it once threatened.</p> <p>\"Our citizens are weary and tired and have spent a lot of money evacuating from Gustav,\" said Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans. \"My expectation this time is it will be very difficult to move the kind of numbers out of this city that we moved during Gustav.\"</p> <p>Ike first slammed into the Turks and Caicos and the southern-most Bahama islands as a category four hurricane, damaging 80% of homes with winds of up to 135mph. Thousands rode out the storm in shelters and there are no reports of casualties so far on the low-lying islands.</p> <p>The Foreign Office last night advised against all but essential travel to Cuba.</p> <p>Authorities at the US naval base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, on Cuba's eastern tip, closed beaches and banned cars from roads. The cells holding terrorism suspects were hurricane-proof, said military officials.</p> <p>Last week's storm wreaked billions of dollars of damage on Cuban agriculture and homes, leading Fidel Castro, the former president, to compare its impact to a nuclear bomb.</p> <p>Ike also brought further devastation in Haiti, killing 48 people and destroying the last bridge into the port of Gonaives, where people are short of food. The latest casualties brought Haiti's death toll from four tropical storms in less than a month to 306. </p> <p>Although rain stopped by late afternoon, large areas remained vulnerable to flooding because rivers were swollen from last week's tropical storm Hanna.</p>",
  "<p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, arrived in Moscow today as part of a European Union delegation hoping to persuade Russia to honour its pledge to withdraw troops from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgia</a>.</p> <p>As Sarkozy arrived in the capital, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman set a tough tone for the talks, saying that Moscow opposed an independent EU monitoring mission in Georgia.</p> <p>Andrei Nesterenko said the deployment of an EU monitoring force would lead to unnecessary \"fragmentation\" of international monitoring efforts by the UN and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p> <p>Sarkozy's primary mission will be to persuade the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, to pull his forces out of Georgia.</p> <p>The EU delegation, which includes the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, will also push for a quick deployment of several hundred EU monitors to Georgia.</p> <p>However, there was little sign that Russia intends to comply with the EU's demands. Nearly a month after a truce negotiated by Sarkozy ended a five-day war, Russian troops remain entrenched deep inside Georgian territory.</p> <p>Earlier today, Russian soldiers turned back a UN convoy from a tense zone around the breakaway province of South Ossetia in a blunt demonstration of who is in charge.</p> <p>The convoy of four vehicles from UN agencies waited for about an hour at the checkpoint in Karaleti, but was turned away after a brief discussion with a Russian general.</p> <p>David Carden, who is leading the interagency mission by the World Food Programme, Unicef and the UN refugee agency, said the teams were attempting to do a preliminary humanitarian assessment and would try again.</p> <p>After talks in Moscow, Sarkozy and the EU delegation will travel to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, to meet the president, Mikheil Saakashvili.</p> <p>Sarkozy has been criticised for giving the Russians too much room for interpretation in the peace deal, which was signed on August 12. His diplomatic blitz to Moscow and Tbilisi is seen by some as a last chance to save it - as well as his own credibility as a peacemaker.</p> <p>Georgia and the west have accused Russia of failing to honour its pledge to withdraw troops to positions held before the fighting broke out. Russia says those troops are peacekeepers and are therefore allowed under the accord to help maintain security around Georgia's breakaway provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Moscow has recognised the two regions as independent states.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Georgia has opened a new legal front in its battle with Russia for control of the regions, going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague over claims of Russian human rights abuses in the two provinces.

  "<p>American universities are starting to market themselves more fiercely in a bid to attract more British and overseas students.</p> <p>Visa restrictions put in place after the September 11 terrorist attacks have now been lifted and US universities are now looking to recruitment agencies and generous bursary schemes to entice overseas students.</p> <p>With the cost of an undergraduate degree in the UK estimated at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/03/tuitionfees.students\">\u00a340,000</a>, scholarship-assisted US university degrees are becoming more appealing.</p> <p>The exact numbers for the last academic year are due from the Institute of International Education's <a href=\"http://opendoors.iienetwork.org/\">Open Doors report</a> in early November.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/27/highereducation.internationaleducationnews1\">last year's figures</a> showed an increase of 2% in 2006-07 (8,438) in the numbers of Britons heading to the States for their higher education.</p> <p>Norman Renshaw, the managing director of InTuition Languages, a company specialising in English language teaching that runs a programme getting US university scholarships for British students, says it is an increasing trend.</p> <p>\"The visa restrictions have been lifted now and US universities are keen to recruit overseas students. They have great facilities and can offer students good contact hours with teachers. They have the product but not the marketing,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Now higher education has opened up into international level a lot of universities are crying out for people. They can either trawl recruitment fairs or say what they want to have, for example 1% from Britain, Sweden, France and the most effective way is to offer scholarships to students with the right kind of profile.</p> <p>\"After a few years that will give them a brand image and awareness in the UK. After a few years working with the head of sixth form recruiting universities after a few years that will become normal practice.\"</p> <p>According to the magazine Times Higher Education, increasing numbers of American institutions are using recruitment agencies.</p> <p>Will Archer, director of the research firm i-graduate, told the THE: \"The US is the largest market for international students and yet it has not had a particularly commercial approach. Now that this has been recognised, there's real movement from an increasing number of universities to appoint education agents.\"</p> <p>Dr Mitch Leventhal, the vice-provost for international affairs at the University of Cincinnati, has set up the American International Recruitment Council to help universities navigate the market for international students.</p> <p>A recent i-graduate survey of 880 agents found that they had placed 60,000 students on courses in 115 countries in 2006, with the UK the leading destination.</p> <p>Leventhal told the THE: \"The US is losing out because it is not adopting 21st-century marketing practices; we're just not competing. I was hired by Cincinnati on the understanding that I would have the ability to explore moving in that direction, but that required a significant sell.</p> <p>US institutions are prohibited from using agents to recruit domestic students. The ban does not apply to international students but many institutions are not aware of this and it has stunted their growth.</p> <p>\"Until now, most US institutions working with agents have been sneaking around, looking over their shoulders, afraid that they are going to be exposed and sanctioned,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Because they have been so paranoid about this, people haven't been sharing best practice - now we need to bring this out into the open because the appetite is huge.\"</p> <p>\"If the US starts to market aggressively then our growth will pick up again, but the market globally is big enough and growing fast enough that we can all grow.\"</p> <p>InTuition Languages runs a showcase event in Florida for two weeks for those hoping to win a sports scholarship from one of the 120 universities the company works with. They are not the Ivy League universities or colleges in New York or San Francisco but good state accredited universities around the country that charge between \u00a310,000 and \u00a321,000 per year.</p> <p>For a refundable fee of \u00a31,500 on the academic scholarship programme or \u00a31,900 for the sports scholarships, potential students can apply for US university degrees, with around 50% of their tuition and living costs paid for.</p> <p>\"The programme's very good for people who are not at the pinnacle of their sport and never going to become professional but who appreciate that they are good at their sport and can use that to pay for their education. There's always the chance they will be spotted on the universities circuit,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>An American drone plane bombed the house and madrasa of a Taliban commander in north-west Pakistan today, killing 16 people including four women and two children, a Pakistani intelligence official said.</p> <p>The 10 others were mainly Taliban fighters from Pakistan and Afghanistan, the official said.</p> <p>The properties belonged to Jalauddin Haqqani, said to be an old friend of the al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>American raids have been targeting militants in Pakistan's tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan.</p> <p>A local resident, Abdur Rahim, said he saw nine bodies removed from the destroyed houses. One of the Taliban, Rehman Uddin, said 20 people were killed and 18 injured.</p> <p>Doctors said between 15 and 20 wounded people were taken to hospital, most of them women and children.</p> <p>Bakht Niaz, a shopkeeper, said he saw two Predator drones flying over the area before several explosions.</p> <p>\"We got out of our shops and ran for safety,\" said Niaz.</p> <p>He said he saw two wounded people being taken away for treatment and around a dozen more in the local hospital.</p> <p>Haqqani fought against Soviet troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s alongside Bin Laden.</p> <p>He and his son Sirajuddin have been linked to attacks this year including an attempt to kill the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, and a raid on a luxury hotel in Kabul. US forces describe him as one of their most dangerous foes.</p> <p>In July, the New York Times reported that Haqqani has close links with Pakistan's notorious Inter-Services Intelligence, which the Afghan government has accused of supporting insurgents.</p> <p>Haqqani is believed to be in poor health, leaving Sirajuddin to lead their Taliban faction.</p> <p>Another son, Badruddin, told Reuters the pair were away from the house at the time. One of his aunts was killed in the strike by six missiles, he said.</p> <p>The madrasa had been closed after previous attacks nearby.</p> <p>The US has been putting pressure on Pakistan to crack down on insurgents using the North-West Frontier province as a base to attack US and Nato forces in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Asif Ali Zardari, who was made Pakistan's president on Saturday, has vowed to tackle militants, but recent US operations have increased public opposition to Pakistan's role in the so-called war on terror.</p> <p>The Pakistani government reacted furiously last Wednesday after a ground assault by helicopter-borne US commandoes in south Waziristan killed a reported 20 people, including women and children. It was the first known incursion into Pakistan by US troops since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. Air strikes later in the week were blamed on the US.</p>",

  "<p><br>Not the only dead legs in the theatre ... Robert Lepage's Lipsynch</p> <p><strong>12.44pm:</strong> Up. Down. Around. I've just played the game of snakes and ladders that is getting into the Barbican Centre and I'm in the theatre foyer waiting for Lipsynch, Robert Lepage's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/feb/19/lyngardner.g2\">nine-hour saga</a>, to begin.</p> <p>My bum is in denial, but I am excited: Lepage's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/jul/12/theatre.artsfeatures\">The Far Side of the Moon</a> was one of the highlights of my theatre-going life. Besides, it's actually more like seven hours' theatre: there are four little intervals and you do get time off for supper. And I like to think Lepage, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/oct/23/theatre2\">a technical wizard</a> of the theatre world, would approve of live blogging.</p> <p><strong>1.55pm:</strong> A short interval. So much for live blogging. Can I get wifi? Can I heck. Turns out it's down throughout the Barbican complex. Oh well, I'll carry on writing as I go.</p> <p>A bit about act one: we hear Gorecki's Symphony Number Three. We see red velvet curtains and a woman. This is Ada. She is an opera singer. The curtains are drawn back to reveal the cockpit of a plane. Ada is one of the passengers. So is a young woman holding a crying baby, who dies (the woman, not the baby). The baby is adopted by Ada, grows up and becomes a surly (but impressively multilingual) teenager called Jeremy.</p> <p>The act ends with a stunning image. A woman walks along the roof of a plane under a roiling sky, as if it were a tightrope, and I get ice-cube-down-the-back shivers. Time, I think to myself, is going to fly.</p> <p><strong>3.55pm:</strong> Another interval break, but not quite long enough to write and pee. Have I mentioned that Lipsynch is meant to be exploring the human voice through nine different protagonists? Well, we're now into the story of Ada's lover, Thomas. He is a neurologist and he must tell Marie, a jazz singer, that her operation will result in a temporary loss of speech.</p> <p>Marie sings April in Paris with a beautifully ravaged voice (is she crying or singing?) and there's a terrific moment when a drunken Thomas appears to sink through a table. We also meet Sarah, an ex-prostitute, who is now a cleaning lady for Ada's former speech therapist. Got that? Keep up. You should probably also know that Sarah's brother, a BBC presenter, has a dark secret.</p> <p>Given that Lipsynch is meant to be about the voice, there are some pretty dodgy accents hitting my ear. Oh, and all the fiddling around with set changes is a snore.</p> <p><strong>5.00pm:</strong> Act four, in which Jeremy, Ada's adopted son, makes a movie very loosely based on his mother's life, and bonks his Mexican leading lady. The evening is starting to feel as though Lepage is trying to whip up an Almodovar-esque soap opera.</p> <p><strong>6.45pm:</strong> I've wolfed down supper (vegetable bake - perfectly decent, thank you very much). I've just watched act five, in which it becomes clear that Lipsynch is probably not going to get better. We're back to Marie the jazz singer, who is worried she is forgetting the sound of her father's voice. And we meet Jackson, a Glaswegian detective. Like all fictional detectives, he is in the middle of a messy divorce. He tracks down his suspect, Sarah, with a recording of her voice, though it might have been quicker to look at the victim's police file. There are more fiddly set changes. Jackson gets around in a car that resembles a hi-tech go-kart. This is extremely silly. Note: I am glad the Barbican's seats are comfy. My left leg is now starting to twitch.</p> <p><strong>8.50pm:</strong> Wow, they're really stretching this thing out. Play hits nadir with storyline about Sebastian, a sound technician, which is an excuse for an extended joke about corpses farting. Yikes. I'm sorry, really not very funny. Then it's on to Michelle, Marie's sister, who ... Nope, I'm sorry, I can't go on. Note: that sound you hear is someone peeling my eyelids up off the Barbican floor.</p> <p><strong>10.00pm:</strong> Lipsynch got off to such a good start, but, like a wind-up toy, it runs out of momentum. It ends on a high, with an image that seems touched by a sorrowful magic, but that's not enough. Some of the storylines are unforgivably limp. It's as if Lepage has made an epic solely to satisfy the public's demand for an epic. Most of the audience gives it a standing ovation. Why? I don't, which makes me blue. I am now doomed to wander the earth like the Ancient Mariner, warning people off this show. It could all have been so different ...

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/\">The Wire's</a> creator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Simon_(writer)\">David Simon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/06/wire\">writing in Saturday's Guardian Weekend magazine</a>, says the reviews and commentary about his show in the British press move him to a \"peculiar and conflicted place\":</p> <blockquote> <p>I'm gratified by the incredible amount of verbiage accorded our little drama and I'm delighted to have the fundamental ideas and arguments of the piece discussed seriously.</p> <p>But at the same time, I'm acutely aware that our dystopian depiction of Baltimore has more appeal the farther one travels from America.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's a longer passage from Simon's piece about what he set out to try and achieve with the show:</p> <blockquote> <p>I used to quote Churchill as declaring that a first-rate mind was one that could maintain two opposing ideas at the same time. It certainly sounded Churchillian to me until someone better read pointed out that this notable quote is by F Scott Fitzgerald.</p> <p>At first this disappoints, because the quote, to me, seems to argue for political nuance, for subtlety and precision in state affairs. For a long while, the literary origin of the credo made no sense.</p> <p>But then, The Wire.</p> <p>As with Fitzgerald, we were selling story only. And at all points, when filming our drama, we understood that we were arguing the case of one America to the other. We were not saying everything, showing everything. We focused on the urban dynamic of drugs, crime and race. We argued the fraud of the drug war and offered an elegy for the death of union labour and the working class. We ruminated on the political infrastructure and its inability to reform. We picked a fight over the decline of public education and the lie behind our national claim to equality of opportunity. And lastly, we suggested that in the end, no one in our media culture is paying attention or asking hard questions.</p> <p>We did not contemplate immigration. We largely ignored sex-based discrimination, feminism and gender issues. We spoke not a word about the pyramid scheme that is the mortgage crisis, or the diminishing consumer class, or the time bomb that all of our China-bought debt might prove to be. Nor did we glory in the healthy sectors of the American economy, in the growth industries of the information age. We did not embrace Brooklyn Heights and West Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Marin County. Hell, we didn't even rest for more than a day or two in Roland Park or Mount Washington or Towson - those Baltimore neighbourhoods that define a viable, monied America. We spoke to the other part of town, the forgotten place, the one they don't tell many stories about, at least not in the medium of entertainment television. It was a story rooted in truth, but it wasn't the only story or the only truth. Who, but a second-rate mind, would claim otherwise?</p> <p>Yet in my country, they actually argue the point. While British audiences might believe The Wire to represent more than it does, Americans - many of them, at least - are quick to argue that it doesn't represent everything and is therefore, somehow, not representative of anything at all.</p> <p>Was the Wire myopic? Should it have been allowed to dwell for five seasons on that in America which is broken and brutal? Was it not obliged, as an act of journalistic equanimity, if not dramatic power, to display portions of the America where human lives are not marginalised and discarded?</p> <p>Well, there are about 350 television shows about the affluent America, the comfortable America, the viable and cohesive nation where everyone gets what they want if they either work hard or know someone or have a pretty face or cheat like hell. That America is available every night, on every channel in the Comcast package.</p> <p>For a brief time, there was one television drama about the other America.</p> <p>Are we really going to debate whether it was one too many?</p> </blockquote>"
