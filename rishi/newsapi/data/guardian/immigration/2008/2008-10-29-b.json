  "<p>It's back to the future with Pakistan's latest response to the Taliban insurgency. With endorsement and limited training from the US, and Chinese-manufactured weapons, Pakistan will arm tribal militias, or lashkars, to fight the Taliban. Led by tribal chiefs (or \"maliks\") marginalised by the Taliban, and with their knowledge of local conditions and mores, Pakistan hopes that the lashkars will be able to defeat the jihadi movement and win the battle for the hearts and minds of tribal communities.</p> <p>The Taliban killed hundreds of maliks as it swept into Pakistan's tribal areas following the US invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. The maliks were often hated by tribal communities because of their harsh and despotic rule. As a result, many people initially greeted the Taliban as liberators replacing the malik feudalism with their ostensibly Islamic brand of social ordering. </p> <p>But that goodwill soon ran out as tribal communities faced the full force of the Taliban's rigid social dictates. All of a sudden people were being brutally punished or killed for refusing to fight with the Taliban and schools and music shops were being bombed.</p> <p>According to the noted Pakistani scientist and political commentator Prof Pervez Hoodbhoy of Qaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, the lashkar strategy is an attempt to \"enable tribal people who now hate the Taliban for their fanatical excesses to fight for their survival under the leadership of their [maliks].\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, as Hoodbhoy sees it, there is very little else Pakistan can do because \"the mantra of development and poverty reduction ... is impossible while the bullets are flying\".</p> <p>The depressing reality is that very little has changed in this part of the world over the intervening centuries. </p> <p>\"The British used lashkars when fighting tribal insurgents [in areas now known as the North-Western Frontier Province]. The Mughals [who ruled India before the British] did it too, so did other rulers,\" says Prof Anatol Lieven, a Pakistan observer from King's College, London.</p> <p>The Taliban have already reacted to the lashkars swiftly and brutally \u2013 80 members of a lashkar from Matt in the north-western mountains of Swat were abducted. Another 50-100 were killed by a suicide bomber while enlisting in Bajaur. Similar attacks in Orakzai and Khyber Agency last week claimed the lives of eight and 100 people respectively.</p> <p>The strategy comes at a time when Pakistan's civilian government is desperate to show unified leadership to its population and the world. Those plans hit a snag last week when, spearheaded by the main religious and secular opposition parties, both houses of Pakistan's parliament <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/pakistan-us-foreign-policy-terrorism\">passed a resolution</a> calling for dialogue with the Taliban and an end to military operations in Pakistan's tribal areas. </p> <p>\"This amounts to de-facto acceptance of a horrifically brutal Taliban state [in many of Pakistan's tribal areas],\" Hoodbhoy argues. </p> <p>Yet calls for negotiating with the Taliban are also starting to emanate from across the border in Afghanistan as well. </p> <p>As I mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/pakistan-us-foreign-policy-terrorism\">a previous article</a> for Cif, high officials \u2013 from Britain's top soldier and diplomat in Afghanistan, the UN's special envoy and the French army chief \u2013 have already concluded that peace can only be secured in the country through dialogue with the Taliban. </p> <p>Gen. David Petraeus \u2013 soon to be supreme commander of US forces in the Middle East and Central Asia \u2013 believes that <br>http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081008/ts_nm/us_afghan_usa_petraeus<br>negotiations with the Taliban could, in part, reduce the violence in Afghanistan. His sentiments are shared by others in the US Defence establishment. \"Ultimately,\" says US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, \"there has to be... reconciliation as part of a political outcome to this.\"</p> <p>These developments represent an indirect admission that the rush to invade Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks has not created greater international peace and security.</p> <p>Despite this, the likelihood of an immediate, peaceful resolution of the Taliban insurgency in Pakistan remains low. Under intense pressure from the US, the Pakistan Army has launched major military operations in Bajaur and Swat, tribal areas with strong Taliban insurgencies. Every day Pakistan's Army boasts of killing more militants \u2013 it claims to have killed 1,500 militants in Bajaur since August alone. </p> <p>The US too has accelerated its unilateral missile strikes in Waziristan, the tribal region on Pakistan's side of the Durand Line that is perhaps the Taliban's most robust stronghold. Just yesterday a suspected US missile strike <a href=\"http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/international/2008/October/international_October1985.xml&amp;section=international\">killed 20 people</a> in Dera Ismail Khan. The US strikes have led some to argue that the Bush administration is seeking an \"<a href=\"http://harpers.org/archive/2008/09/hbc-90003588\">October surprise</a>\".</p> <p>Such military strikes, particularly those carried out by Pakistan, have had <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/db/blogs/54127/2008/09/1-155515-1.htm\">a devastating impact</a> on tribal societies. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that around 310,000 people have been displaced by the conflict. Estimates of civilian casualties range from 300 to 1,500. </p> <p>There is, sadly, no reason to presume that fiercely independent and opportunistic tribal lashkars will prevent this human disaster. As Rahimullah Yousufzai, perhaps the pre-eminent Pashtun journalist in Pakistan, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE49N2MF20081024\">told Reuters</a>, \"if these lashkars expel militants then it's OK but there's no guarantee the lashkars won't get out of control and become personal militias of tribal elders.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.khabrein.info/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17816&amp;pop=1&amp;page=0&amp;Itemid=57\">Another concern</a>, voiced by Senator Mualana Saleh Shah from South Waziristan, is that the lashkar proposal could \"further worsen the situation in the tribal areas\" by pitting tribe against tribe.</p> <p>Pakistan's tribal areas have a long history of regional hegemons, from the British to the Pakistanis, playing off one antagonist against another in a bid to vicariously control the entire region. Its people are well aware of this history.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://crss.pk/Fata/FATA_Survey_Aug2008.ppt\">a survey</a> [Powerpoint] conducted by a Pakistani thinktank in the federally administered tribal areas in August, 77% of residents do not welcome the Pakistani army. Lashkars that are seen as abusing their power to lord over the population may be equally unwelcome, if not more so. </p> <p>The Taliban was able to build safe havens in Pakistan's tribal areas because successive Pakistani and British administrations neglected the region's social and economic welfare. Even if the lashkars are successful in driving out the Taliban, they do nothing to assist in integrating Taliban-affected tribal areas with the rest of Pakistan.</p>",
  "<p>Congolese rebels closed in on the eastern town of Goma today, causing panic among residents and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of international aid workers and UN staff. </p> <p>Around 45,000 internal refugees, most of whom had only arrived on foot a day earlier, fled a displaced person's camp near Goma as forces loyal to the Tutsi warlord Laurent Nkunda battled international peacekeepers and government troops. </p> <p>After the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon warned of a humanitarian crisis of \"catastrophic dimensions\", the rebels announced tonight that they were declaring a unilateral ceasefire \"to avoid panicking the population of Goma\".</p> <p>Nkunda's men have already captured a string of key towns near Goma in North Kivu province and raised fears of a return to full-scale war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The national army has been routed, and troops were reported to be fleeing Goma. </p> <p>Tension between Congo and Rwanda, which it accuses of supporting Nkunda, also increased sharply, as they traded accusations over cross-border artillery attacks. The US said that while Rwanda was not directly involved in the fighting, its territory was being used to support the rebels.</p> <p>The rebel advance has caused alarm in the international community. The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, called for the deployment of a hundreds-strong EU force to eastern Congo, while the UN security council expressed \"gave concern\" at the fighting and called an emergency meeting to discuss an urgent request for more troops for the UN peacekeeping force. </p> <p>The US has dispatched its top Africa envoy, Jendayi Frazer, for talks in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa. Louis Michel, the EU's development aid commissioner was also there to meet President Joseph Kabila. </p> <p>Congo's previous wars between 1997 and 2003 sucked in several neighbouring countries and caused the greatest loss of life anywhere in the world since the second world war, with more than five million deaths, mainly from hunger and illness. Since then the mineral-rich east of the country has remained restive, despite a peace agreement signed by all the main rebel groups in January this year. </p> <p>Nkunda, who is though to have about 5,000 fighters in his National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), claims to be protecting the minority Tutsi population in the east from Hutu militias linked to the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Despite signing the peace deal he refuses to disarm, accusing government forces of breaking the ceasefire agreement and collaborating with the Hutu rebels. </p> <p>Both the army and the CNDP rebels have a deep mistrust of MONUC, the 17,000-strong peacekeeping force, and both forces have separately attacked it in recent days. MONUC has pledged to defend the North Kivu towns of Goma, Sake, Masisi and Rutshuru, which were abandoned by the Congolese forces on Tuesday, from Nkunda's fighters. But Alain Doss, MONUC's chief, said the force was \"stretched to the limit\" and has requested additional support.</p> <p>After coming under much criticism for failing to protect civilians, MONUC attack helicopters fired on Nkunda's forces today in Kibumba, 19 miles north of Goma, stalling the rebel progress. </p> <p>\"We were positioned just 15 kilometres from town, but MONUC engaged us with their helicopter gunships,\" Amani Babu, a senior CNDP officer told Agence France Presse before the ceasefire announcement. \"We think in two or three days we will be able to take the town of Goma.\"</p> <p>Aid agencies say that would be a disaster. Some 250,000 people have already been forced from their homes in North Kivu this year. Tens of thousands have had to flee their homes or temporary shelters on foot this week. Some 30,000 arrived at a makeshift camp in Kibati, six miles north of Goma, in recent days, \"exhausted and traumatised\". But the camp emptied this afternoon when the refugees saw government forces retreating south \"fairly fast, and in fairly large numbers\", according to Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the UN refugee agency. \"The whole camp was packing up and leaving,\" he said. </p> <p>The atmosphere in Goma was extremely tense before the ceasefire announcement. There were reports of government troops firing into the air and commandeering vehicles. Civilians hurled rocks at a UN compound near the airport as rumours swirled that the town was about to be overrun. Emmanuel de Merode, the director of Virunga national park, which is directly north of Goma, said in a telephone interview from the town that gunfire from the surrounding hills could be heard for much of the day. </p> <p>\"There has been movement of government troops out of the town, which caused panic among the population,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The tide has certainly turned. For decades, ideas that were once were a reference point for social progress have been derided and marginalised. Now the neo-liberal consensus, which was certain of its own invincibility, has been swept aside by what could well be the greatest financial crisis in history. Millions can now see with their own eyes that the emperor has no clothes. </p> <p>It is an opportunity, certainly, for the left to reassert a vision of a new world. Already, practical and common-sense arguments of the left are being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/04/greenpolitics.climatechange\">rehabilitated</a>: that we should be the masters of the economy rather than its servants, that the state should direct investment to meet the needs of society, and that those who are most able to pay should make the greatest contribution through their taxes. </p> <p>Ironically, in its own way the scale and swiftness of the bank bail-out has vindicated the slogan of the global justice movement that \"another world is possible\". It would only cost <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7634641.stm\">\u00a32.7bn</a> to save the lives of 6 million children who die due to poverty. Yet in one week governments have come up with more than \u00a3400bn to shore up a failing financial system. Clearly the demands of campaigners and aspirations of whole swathes of humanity are utterly achievable \u2013 if the political will is there.</p> <p>The challenge \"after New Labour\" is to hold on to this truth, as a sea of dangers will also need to be navigated. The casualties of the coming recession will be counted in their millions. Jobs will be lost, homes will be repossessed, poverty will grow.</p> <p>Martin Luther King said that, \"An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.\" His words remain as powerful now as they ever were. For the collapse of the old orthodoxy by no means guarantees the emergence of a new human solidarity. A wave of racism and xenophobia could easily engulf a fearful and insecure society. </p> <p>Already disillusionment with the establishment has lead to an alarming rise in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/03/localgovernment.localelections08\">far right</a>. A critical factor in their growth has been the way large sections of the white working class have been taken for granted, their needs effectively ignored by cynical politicians fixated with triangulation. The first-past-the-post system means that all the mainstream parties compete to woo the middle-class voters of a few marginal seats. The sense of abandonment and anger is easily exploited by extremists who wish to ferment racial tension. The answer is not for parties to pander to such simplistic scapegoating by competing to be the toughest on immigration and multiculturalism, but to highlight the need for a more just redistribution of wealth and resources.</p> <p>Other significant sections of the voting population also feel the political system has failed them. It is simply too unresponsive to popular will. I regularly come across young people disillusioned with any concept of engagement in the democratic process because their experience is one in which they have seen millions participate in anti-war protests, yet be ignored by government. </p> <p>Just as our financial system needs an overhaul, so too does our political system. A vigorous campaign for proportional representation could well be one platform around which the diverse groups committed to peace and social justice could unite. Time after time the British public has shown itself to be more progressive than its supposed representatives \u2013 whether on foreign policy, climate change or public services. The democratic deficit between the British public and their political institutions demands urgent attention.</p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free &amp; Soundings journal, will take place in London at Kings Place on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<p>With a few exceptions, like the Ask The Audience graph on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and the age-old question of whether it's acceptable to phone up a 78-year-old on Taxpayer Radio and tell him you've boffed his granddaugher, it's a largely reliable rule that the longer something exists, the more opinion of it unifies. A discourse forms and then congeals. This certainly applies to football tournaments, on two levels: firstly during the championship itself, when various opinions of its place in the pantheon zip up and down like a graphic equaliser before settling within thrusting distance of each other by the end; and then after the championship, when that loosish discourse solidifies into that dreadful thing called received wisdom.</p> <p>The only general exception to this occurs because of the mind-altering drug that is patriotism: Italia 90 and Euro 96, for example, are mostly recalled as farragoes of negativity outside England and Germany (who - and you might have forgotten this - won both tournaments). The other is USA 94, which seems to be football's ultimate Marmite tournament. In a recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/jun/27/euro2008.euro2000?showallcomments=\" true\"\" title=\"\">Joy of Six on great tournaments</a>, descriptions of it by you bloggers included \"a belter\", \"the worst World Cup\", \"[it] rocked like a truck\", \"brilliant at the time though hindsight says it was a rather patchy affair\", \"my personal fave\", \"a nadith (sic)\", \"a cracker\", \"pure cack\", \"great\", and \"<a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI\">pr-etty good</a>\".</p> <p>In the opinion of this narrator, it deserves to be recognised as very good, which puts a decent amount of daylight between it and everything else since Mexico 86. Clearly it was not perfect, and those who disparage it will cite at least two, possibly all seven, of the following pieces of information: the soul-crushing final; the predictable semi-finals; the absence of British teams; a victorious side who were Brazilian only in name; the death of Andres Escobar; the fact that it was in America; and Matt Lorenzo fronting ITV's coverage.</p> <p>We'll come to those later - although the last one is the fairest cop - but there were so many positive things about USA that not even Satan's PR people would bother arguing against them. The most important, as ever, were goals. The tournament was the first after the backpass law was introduced in 1992, and so came between the ultra-defensive Italia 90 and a time when defences had fully worked out how to get round the new rule. Consequently, it was as ingenuous as modern football could ever be. The final was terrible, but it wasn't for the want of trying: only Norway were a genuinely negative presence, and most of the teams had a real go. The average of 2.712 net-ticklers per game is the second-highest since Mexico 70 (behind Spain 1982), and the total of 44 goals in 15 knockout games (excluding the third-place play-off, which has an end-of-term autonomy that renders it irrelevant for this purpose) is the highest since the round of 16 was introduced in 1986.</p> <p>Exactly a quarter of those goals came from a quartet of attackers whose impish menace illuminated the tournament: none of Roberto Baggio, Romario, Hristo Stoichkov and Gheorghe Hagi are taller than 5ft 9ins, and the latter three in particular gleefully tormented the bigger boys with the mischief and coiled aggression of urchin pickpockets.</p> <p>Romario and Baggio could not redeem <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw9TJFmlbJU&amp;feature=related\">a final</a> that passed into infamy even before it ended sadly in a penalty competition. There's no doubt it stunk, and the fact that it was the first to be a) goalless and b) decided on penalties means that, even if it went door to door like Jesus Quintana, it would not be forgiven in polite society. But did it stink quite as much as we remember?</p> <p>Actually yes, yes it did, but there were still moments of the highest drama. Gianluca Pagliuca had the \"luck of the devil\" when he bar-of-soaped Mauro Silva's feeble long-ranger on to a post. Romario and Bebeto both missed open goals. Viola went on that coronary/orgasm-inducing solo run in extra-time. Baggio, who was on his last legs at the start of the game never mind the end, missed a great late chance to make this every bit as much his World Cup as it was Diego Maradona's in 1986. Overall it was certainly not as bad as the 1990 final: it was much less cynical, and at least you didn't know who'd win this one. There was also a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=boPQNpPvJq0\">truly legendary display</a> of unyielding defensive excellence from a palpably unfit Franco Baresi, 34, <em>who had undergone a knee operation less than a month earlier</em>. The stones on that one!</p> <p>It was also, lest we forget, one of only three 0-0 draws in the tournament (you should remember the others, because they went past forgettable and round to hideously memorable: Bolivia v South Korea and Ireland v Norway). The fact that the victors were perceived as being Brazilian only in name is also used in evidence against the tournament. In his World Cup history, Brian Glanville describes them as \"a dull, functional [team] which relied heavily on the inventive brilliance of Romario and Bebeto up front, scarcely served by a pedestrian midfield.\" This team certainly wasn't fit to play keepy-uppy with the same table-tennis ball as the vintages of 1970 and 1982, yet the suspicion remains that, like the Coen Brothers with Burn After Reading and Intolerable Cruelty, they are being judged only by the stratospheric standards they have previously set. Their midfield may have been mostly water-carriers, but they did not tread water in possession: Brazil still played some high-class one-touch stuff. And they had Romario. Workmanlike/efficient from top to toe except for one minuscule but incredibly important piece as the focal point: were they really much different from Argentina in 1986?</p> <p>The hero of that tournament, Maradona, was one of the villains of this. And while guardian.co.uk does not condone, etc, etc, there's no question that, in a world obsessed with the salacious, his drug-test failure added a huge layer of melodrama to the tournament: aptly, Argentina had relocated to Dallas by the time the news broke.</p> <p>So, alas, did the shocking death of Andres Escobar. He was part of a Colombia team which, at the start of the tournament, were hailed as potential winners by Pele among others. Though they flopped fatally, the pre-tournament hype was one of the joys of this tournament: we knew very little about the Colombians, save for Carlos Valderrama, Faustino Asprilla and the mythical 5-0 win away to Argentina. This was the last World Cup that represented a thrilling step into the unknown: there were few foreign players in the Premiership, no live coverage of European leagues apart from Serie A, and no internet. The <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=fgI3fxuSrRM\">Nigerians</a> in particular were revelatory.</p> <p>The absence of British sides accentuated the sense of this being a voyage of discovery. It is very much a personal issue: while some prefer tournaments that aren't polluted with Englishness, for the majority the absence of Carlton Palmer, Andy Sinton and David Batty ruined USA 94 before it started. Certainly the location of the tournament did. In the years leading up to the tournament, every Punt, Dennis and Harry spoofed Soccerball and the like - and hilariously too, oh aye - which created an almost self-fulfilling prophecy of presumed excess. That seemed to be confirmed by Diana Ross's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=WXjCKwBtG0I\">penalty-kick farce</a> before the first game but, apart from that, it was largely handled very well. And accusations of apathy don't really stand up to the fact that this was the highest-attended World Cup of all, both in total and average crowds.</p> <p>Some suggest that those crowds witnessed very few great games or great goals, but this is highly debatable. Romania v Argentina was a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=dRUhJkZQorI&amp;feature=related\">bona fide classic</a>, the best World Cup game since France v Brazil in 1986. All four quarter-finals were subject to riveting late stings, which more than compensated for the relatively predictable semi-finals. Then there were Argentina v Nigeria, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=mFFXdDAKnU8\">Nigeria v Italy</a>, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=gVR4gB97TQ8&amp;feature=related\">Colombia v Romania</a>, Spain v South Korea, and Germany v South Korea. There were more genuinely great games at France 98, but they, like that <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=V6ftqU2watI&amp;feature=related\">astonishing scene in Intacto</a>, stood out partly because the rest of the story was so so-so. At USA 94, the balance of the great, the good and those involving Norway reflected a strong narrative perfectly.</p> <p>So did the goals. In truth the two most celebrated goals of the championship are overrated: <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=OZX6LXL9Pjc\">Saeed Al-Owairan's against Belgium</a> (look how heavy his third-last touch is. Sorry, but how can you take that seriously?); and Hagi, who benefited from the slack his own greatness had earned when what was almost certainly a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2arEYJbTI\">misplaced cross</a> against Colombia was perceived to be deliberate (nobody said the same of Ion Andoni Goikoetxea's goal against Germany, did they?). But those aside the tournament was awash with some <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=otPypMC_kzA\">enormously classy goals</a>. Personal favourites are <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZjYQPpP8M\">all of Baggio's</a>, each taken with Zen-like calm and scary precision (all five hit the side-netting), Tomas Brolin's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=pzV4KNj51Do\">high-IQ free-kick</a> against Romania, the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ak2DfCwuMkQ\">sublime-touch-for-a-big-man lob by Kennet Andersson</a> against Brazil, and the two that Hagi and Ilie Dumitrescu made for each other on the counter <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=OnNliThxA7c\">against Argentina</a>, each dependent on a deliciously judged pause while they waited for the appropriate pass to present itself.</p> <p>Then there were the little details, the one-liners that embellish the plot. In what may turn out to be the longest paragraph ever, we'll attempt to list them. The late kick-off times in England, nirvana for the freaks, geeks and insomniacs; Barry Davies doing his only World Cup final; Martin Dahlin and Andersson proving that direct football could be both thrilling <em>and</em> classy (Sweden were the tournament's top scorers with 15); the haircuts, from <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zrjrYgGOlyY\">Yordan Letchkov</a> legitimising baldness to Alain Sutter's <a href=\"http://cache.gettyimages.com/xc/72528025.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=17A4AD9FDB9CF193875DCB1DD8387ABBDAD19435506456FEA40A659CEC4C8CB6\">uber-Fabio mane</a>, Tony Meola's <a href=\"http://cache.gettyimages.com/xc/1790682.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=17A4AD9FDB9CF1939057D9939C83F106EB9D991E069F59655A5397277B4DC33E\">Shep-from-Fargo greaseback</a>, the Happy Days side-parting of Mexico's Zague, Alexi Lalas's - well what exactly <em>was</em> that? - and, of course, future Reading keeper's Borislav Mikhailov's syrup; Romania, the World Cup's best loose cannons since <em>ever</em> (and to think it could have been Wales); the Americans' <a href=\"http://www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk/International-Teams-North-America/c23_80/p1585/1994-USA-Home-Shirt-L/product_info.html\" title=\"\">cool but hangover-baiting home kit</a> and their <a href=\"http://www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk/International-Teams-North-America/c23_80/p13280/1994-USA-Away-Shirt-L/product_info.html?osCsid=\" lqva421pqt40ev7a7g4mqoqn45\"\" title=\"\">hideous away kit</a>; <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=FgfM2QBFWL8\">Rashidi Yekini's throatlump-inducing celebration</a> after scoring Nigeria's first World Cup goal; a dead rubber given significant life by the record-breaking of Roger Milla, the oldest World Cup goalscorer, and Oleg Salenko, the first man to score five goals in one World Cup game; the story of Italy, who went closer to the precipice than James Bond in almost every game but kept surviving; Clive Tyldesley's absurdly extravagant pronunciation of 'Dooooooomidrescu'; Romario slithering magisterially through a non-existent space between two defenders only to eventually have his shot cleared off the line in the semi-final against Sweden; the bravest decision in managerial history, by Arrigo Sacchi, when he took Roberto Baggio off after Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off against Norway; the magnificent certainty of Dunga's spot-kick, the eighth and penultimate in the final, which put Brazil in the lead for the first time and was the first example of the 'captain's penalty'; the glorious meltdown of John Aldridge and Jack Charlton; the brutality and Hitchcockian suddenness of Leonardo's elbow on the USA's Tab Ramos, an incident that has become more unfathomable as we have got to know him subsequently; Greece being so inept that they allowed Argentina to have a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=oN_q2Smb208\">four-on-one attack</a> <em>in the second minute of their first-ever World Cup game</em>; Viola's 14 minutes of fame; a group of death so tight that Mexico, Italy, Ireland and Norway finished on the same points and with the same goal difference; the forgotten contribution of Daniele Massaro, the only non-Baggio to score for Italy in the tournament and the other man besides Baresi and Baggio to miss in the final shoot-out; and a performance of such comic ineptitude from the referee Jamal Al Sharif in the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=CFp2rN4vsf4\">Mexico v Bulgaria match</a> that even Trevor Brooking eased himself away from the splinters of the fence to call it: \"(An) absolute scandal ... I cannot find words to find the stupidness of that decision\".</p> <p>It wasn't all bad, was it.</p>",
  "<p>Contrary to published reports, the presidential election won't happen until November 4. Those hundreds of thousands of robo-calls, the blizzard of TV ads, or other unforeseen events could propel a Republican team to the White House, leaving president-elect John McCain to assemble a cabinet to run the government. (See Barack Obama's potential green team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/30/network\">here</a>)</p> <p>The global economic crisis, for the moment, is dominating the headlines, but there is no doubt the next president will have to grapple with daunting energy and environmental issues fairly quickly once in office. For starters, fuel prices could careen upward again, and a post-Kyoto summit between 189 countries to hash out new greenhouse-gas reduction targets is set for Copenhagen in late 2009. </p> <p>McCain would need to decide quickly whom he would trust to navigate his climate, energy, and conservation policies through the tricky shoals of environmental groups, powerful Democrats in Congress, conservative Republicans, and industry barons. Not to mention the leaders of rapidly developing China and India ...</p> <p>So who would staff a McCain administration's environmental posts? Grand Old Party (GOP) Republican insiders, industry lobbyists, and think tankers talked to Grist about names being mentioned for a McCain government.</p> <h2>Secretary of Energy</h2> <p><strong>Pete Domenici</strong><br>Right-wingers who still challenge global warming, or at least linking it to human activities, say they don't have a glacier's chance in hell of being heard in a McCain administration on energy. But if they did, they'd pick Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) to lead the Department of Energy. Domenici, New Mexico's retiring elder statesman, is a backer of nuclear power who's a favorite among conservatives and industry groups, but they acknowledge he probably wouldn't get the nod. Politically, Domenici's tangential involvement in the U.S. attorneys firings wouldn't help him win confirmation, but more practically, he announced last year that he's suffering from a degenerative brain disease.</p> <p><strong>Heather Wilson</strong><br>Another New Mexican who gets mentioned is Rep. Heather Wilson (R), a Domenici prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who lost the GOP primary this year to run for Domenici's seat. McCain, who is pushing construction of nuclear power plants, might find Wilson hard to dismiss. Women and minorities are often traditionally picked for Cabinet posts. A former Rhodes Scholar, she has served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where she supported nuclear energy, and on the Select Committee on Intelligence, which monitors nuclear weapons. Her district is home to the Sandia National Laboratories, and she is an Air Force veteran. \"From her background in national security, she knows the nuclear issues that make up much of Energy's jurisdiction,\" said Jack Pitney, politics professor at Claremont McKenna College.</p> <p>But environmentalists and others might fight her appointment. Wilson voted to scrap critical habitat for endangered species, and against a multimillion conservation fund that New Mexico farmers backed. The League of Conservation Voters put her on its \"Dirty Dozen\" list in 2002, citing her support for uranium industry practices that contaminate groundwater, and for mining company polluters.</p> <p><strong>James Inhofe</strong><br>Under their breath, industry groups invoke Sen. Jim Inhofe's (R-Okla.) name for this post. But it's hard to see an expanded Democratic Senate majority voting to confirm one of the most outspoken climate-change skeptics.</p> <h2>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator</h2> <p>The nation's top pollution cop, the EPA's mission is to protect human health and the environment under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Superfund law, and other regulations. Many career staff, scientists, and environmentalists say that under Stephen Johnson that mission has been impossible to carry out, citing his refusal to quickly act on a U.S. Supreme Court order to evaluate greenhouse gases as a public risk, among other decisions. Industry groups say he's gotten a bad rap, but know the winds of change are blowing.</p> <p>\"I think industry groups are all going to have concerns about anybody McCain will pick. In my mind it's going to be Lieberman, or somebody like that,\" said Frank Maisano, an energy specialist at the law firm of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani (yes, that Giuliani). \"Somebody like Sherry Boehlert who's a real champion of the environment.\"</p> <p><strong>Sherwood Boehlert</strong><br>Sherwood Boehlert, who retired last year after 24 years as a New York congressman, is still widely respected by Washington insiders as a consummate moderate Republican. He spent his entire career on the House Science Committee and is best known for his environmental policy work, including helping to design a pioneering cap-and-trade program to control acid rain, fighting for higher fuel-economy standards, and pushing to fund science and math education. He currently sits on the board of the bipartisan Alliance for Climate Protection, headed by former vice president Al Gore. </p> <p><strong>Joe Lieberman</strong><br>Many feel that Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) deserves his pick of plum administration jobs for faithful support of his Senate colleague. As coauthor with McCain of Congress' first attempt at a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse-gas emissions, he could make a good EPA administrator - or perhaps energy secretary.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Shays</strong><br>Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) shares McCain's positions on many environmental issues, including developing wind, geothermal, and biofuel energy, exploring for oil off the coast, and building new nuclear plants. He coauthored a bipartisan bill to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, promote renewable energy, and repeal some tax breaks for fossil-fuel industries.</p> <p><strong>William Reilly</strong><br>William Reilly, a longtime director at DuPont and former president of the World Wildlife Fund, is an investment capitalist who still wins kudos for his tenure at EPA under the first President Bush. In 2007, he pulled off a coup through the leveraged buyout of TXU, which reduced plans for a dozen new coal-fired power plants to three. </p> <p><strong>Christine Todd Whitman</strong><br>Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and later EPA administrator during much of George W. Bush's first term, is a woman who could deliver the message loudly that a McCain administration would not be the same as a Bush administration when it comes to energy and the environment.</p> <p><strong>Mary Gade</strong><br>Mary Gade said she was forced to quit as EPA administrator in the Midwest after tangling with Dow Chemical Co. over dioxin contamination. She is seen by many as a poster child for current agency abuses. She's also a Republican and corporate attorney who understands how EPA works.</p> <p><strong>David McIntosh</strong><br>Conservatives say David McIntosh, a Newt Gingrich Republican who gave up his House seat for an unsuccessful run for Indiana governor back in 2000, would be dandy, while environmentalists say he would be a doozy. McIntosh, now a D.C. law partner, served as executive director of former vice president Dan Quayle's Council for Competitiveness, where he worked to roll back environmental regulations and push a rewrite of the Clean Air Act that would allow polluters to increase emissions without notifying the public.</p> <h2>Secretary of Agriculture</h2> <p>This position executes farming and ranching policy (obviously), promoting agricultural production and trade. But it also administers ethanol subsidies and handles food safety and hunger prevention, including the food-stamp and organic-food-labeling programs. And don't forget that the Forest Service falls under this department, overseeing nearly 300,000 square miles of national forests.</p> <p><strong>Calvin Dooley</strong><br>Conservatives and industry representatives say if McCain is serious about appointing Democrats to high posts, this would be a good spot. They drool over Calvin Dooley, a former Democratic congressman from California's Central Valley who understands agribusiness issues. He was previously head of the Food Products Association and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, two major food-industry trade groups, and he's currently CEO of the American Chemistry Council. But he may be making too nice of a salary at his new job to be lured away for government service.</p> <p><strong>James Leach</strong><br>Some environmentalists, on the other hand, see a Republican they like. Jim Leach, a 30-year Iowa congressman who was defeated in 2006, is now interim director of Harvard's Institute of Politics, on leave from Princeton where he's a professor of public and international affairs. He \"was very much interested in reform and good government, and would not be susceptible to the kinds of political pressures brought to bear on farm policy,\" said Jim DiPeso, policy director for Republicans for Environmental Protection. But that endorsement speech Leach gave for Obama at the Democratic National Convention might dim his chances, not to mention his current job as leader of the campaign finance reform group Common Cause.</p> <p><strong>Ben Nelson</strong><br>Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson is another heartland Democrat who tends to be in line with McCain on a number of issues, particularly climate change. But they don't see eye to eye on ethanol subsidies, which McCain famously told Iowa voters he would cut. Taking a job in a McCain administration would give Nebraska's Republican governor the chance to appoint a GOP replacement, which could factor into Nelson's decision making, particularly if losing his seat would deny Senate Democrats the 60-vote supermajority needed to truly command the Senate.</p> <p><strong>Mark Sanford</strong><br>South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford (R) wins praise from some who note he shares McCain's views on farm subsidies, but others say South Carolina is too far from the nation's corn fields.</p> <p><strong>Terry Everett</strong><br>Alabama Rep. Terry Everett (R) is from the South, not the Plains states or the West, but \"he knows ag backwards and forwards\" because of his long tenure on the House Agriculture Committee, said Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.</p> <p><strong>Edward T. Schafer</strong><br>\"Why not keep the current guy [Schafer] in place?\" suggested Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"He just came into the job a year or two ago.\" Well, the current agriculture secretary's chances of holding onto his job might be harmed by those E. coli outbreaks.</p> <h2>Secretary of the Interior</h2> <p>The nation's landlord, the Interior Department manages 500 million acres of land and the oil-rich Outer Continental Shelf, overseeing not just oil supplies but coal, natural gas, wind, solar, and geothermal too. The department also administers much of the West's water supply, national parks, relations with the nation's tribes, and protection of endangered species. Traditionally headed by a well-known Westerner, Interior has endured embarrassments in recent years, including meddling by a high-ranking deputy on endangered-species protections that allegedly could have affected her family farm, and drunken sexcapades by Minerals Management Service employees hobnobbing with industry representatives.</p> <p><strong>Dirk Kempthorne</strong><br>There's been some speculation that McCain might just keep current Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in place. \"That would not be smart in light of the departmental scandals,\" said Pitney at Claremont McKenna College. Environmentalists agree, saying he has protected fewer endangered species than James Watt, is a strong backer of oil-shale leasing in the Rockies, and supported polluting industries as Idaho governor. They say he has done little to clean up agency shenanigans.</p> <p>Nonsense, says Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"Kempthorne doesn't have an ounce of any responsibility for those scandals; in fact he's been part of the team breaking them up.\" Maisano and others say Kempthorne knows D.C. and the West well (as a former Idaho governor and U.S. senator). Kempthorne has come up to speed on the controversial issues facing Interior, including offshore oil drilling, the proposed listing of the polar bear as endangered, wind power leases, and coal mining permits. He is also as passionate about national parks as McCain. In fact, says Maisano, \"I would think Kempthorne might be more comfortable with the McCain camp than the Bush camp.\"</p> <p><strong>Jon Huntsman, Jr.</strong><br>Utah's Jon Huntsman, Jr. (R), another Western governor who is the son of a chemical magnate, would be more palatable to some. He has been more moderate than expected, and wants Utah to reduce fuel and energy consumption. He is also concerned about nuclear waste being stored in his state, which might raise red flags for McCain.</p> <p><strong>Barbara Cubin</strong><br>Right-wingers say it is vital for McCain to remember that to win and keep Republican support in the West, he needs to select a rural, lands-rights supporter \"who knows something about the history of federal lands and what the problems really are,\" said Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"Someone from the intermountain West like Gale Norton, but who is not an urbanite like her.\" Rep. Barbara Cubin (R-Wyo.), a pro-mining, rural Republican who is pushing a bill that would require new refineries to be permitted within 90 days, would be ideal for them.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Allard</strong><br>Colorado's Wayne Allard (R), a veterinarian by trade who is retiring from the Senate, also would fit the bill for lands-rights GOP'ers.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Gilchrist</strong><br>Surprisingly, environmentalists and industry reps alike mention Maryland Rep. Wayne Gilchrist, a nine-term congressman who this year was defeated for reelection in the GOP primary by a right-wing conservative. Gilchrist is a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee, and he worked for the Forest Service in Idaho for a brief period. But Ebell says it would be ridiculous to have an East Coaster running Interior, no matter how liked he may be inside the Beltway for protecting Chesapeake Bay. The real deal-killer could be his endorsement of Obama, though.</p> <h2>Bonus Position: Energy/Climate Czar (or Czarina)</h2> <p>The 2008 oil spike proved how politically potent energy issues can be. A President McCain might seek to demonstrate a firm hand by appointing a top White House official to coordinate administration policy on energy, with climate change also tacked onto his or her portfolio.</p> <p><strong>James Woolsey</strong><br>Jim Woolsey, the former CIA director turned climate-change and renewable-energy wonk, was hired by McCain during the primary season as a senior adviser on these issues. Some say he's the leading candidate for an energy czar job because he knows global politics so well and is a formidable advocate for domestic energy production as a security policy, not to mention for electric cars. Woolsey has already served under four U.S. presidents in a variety of roles. It would be interesting for the one-time head of the nation's secretive spy agency to sit down with world ministers to hammer out climate-change policy. \"I'm sure he can disarm them,\" quipped one Republican strategist. </p> <p><strong>Sarah Palin</strong><br>Sarah Palin, who has already said she'd like to handle the energy portfolio as vice president, might pull rank and keep the energy czar job for herself. Somebody needs to pick up where Dick Cheney left off, property-rights advocates and climate-change skeptics say. Environmentalists say not a chance. Palin has sued the federal government to stop listing of polar bears as an endangered species and pushed for more oil and gas drilling, among other moves. \"I think Sarah Palin would be great,\" said Ebell of CEI.</p> <p><strong><br>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong><br>California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) is termed out as California governor in 2010, can't be president because he wasn't born in the United States, and is looking for greener pastures. He's got megawatt star power and hands-on experience crafting an ambitious climate plan.</p> <p>\"I can't think of a better energy czar than Arnold Schwarzenegger,\" said DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection. He said that while the \"Governator\" could run for the Senate, \"I don't think he'd be interested. He's the sort of guy who likes to be in charge. \u2026 The best job for the Terminator is to hold a high-level executive position. He's demonstrated an interest in the issue, and he's got the policy right. There wouldn't be any on-the-job training there. He's done the bipartisan cracking of heads and gotten people together.\"</p> <p>Of course, AB 32 -- the California climate law -- has yet to be fully implemented, and Schwarzenegger's popularity has sunk amid the state's fiscal woes. Still, California and its toothsome governor could both be winners no matter who becomes president. Both McCain and Obama have said that unlike Bush, they would order a waiver granted to enable California to proceed with plans to regulate greenhouse gases from automobiles.</p> <p>Curiously, Schwarzenegger hasn't visibly campaigned much for his good friend John McCain (though he's scheduled to hit the trail in Ohio this week on the GOP ticket's behalf). There's talk in Sacramento that the reason is that he'd love to be energy czar for someone else: Barack Obama. With his spouse's Kennedy clan connections (cue the Maria Shriver endorsement footage), he might be ready to pack his bags.</p> <p>Schwarzenegger spokesperson Julie Soderlund laughed off all the talk, saying, \"The Governor is 100 percent focused on California and meeting the challenges the state is facing right now. So at this point the governor is not looking beyond the immediate needs of the state.\" She said he had done half a dozen in-state appearances for McCain, and would stump for him in Ohio on Halloween. Also, his air board's plan for cutting greenhouse gases would give free permits to polluters, which McCain favors, rather than the 100 percent auction that Obama supports. Some environmentalists say while Schwarzenegger has taken bold action at times, he has also vetoed or stalled on key protections, mollifying large utilities and the heavily polluting shipping industry, for instance. Trick or treat, anyone?</p>",
  "<p>Joaquin Phoenix, the twice Oscar-nominated star of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/83550/gladiator\">Gladiator</a> and the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, has announced his decision to <a href=\"http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2008/10/joaquin_phoenix_leaving_the_si.php\">retire from acting to pursue a career in music</a>.</p> <p>Phoenix said this to a presenter for US celebrity TV show Extra at a benefit for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paulnewman\">Paul Newman</a>-backed charity in San Francisco last night. Phoenix had been on stage performing with Hollywood glitterati such as Julia Roberts, Jack Nicholson, Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Warren Beatty, Danny DeVito and Sean Penn in a one-off production of Ernest Hemingway's The World of Nick Adams.</p> <p>\"I want to take this opportunity ... also to give you the exclusive and just talk a little bit about the fact that this will be my last performance as an actor,\" Phoenix told the shocked reporter. \"I'm not doing films any more.\" The actor's representative later confirmed the news.</p> <p>Phoenix has been working on an album with Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess. The move into music follows his successful turn in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/108558/walk.the.line\">Walk the Line</a>, in which the actor performed all of Cash's famous songs. In addition to his Oscar nomination for best actor, Phoenix won a Grammy for his work on the soundtrack.</p> <p>It's not the first time Phoenix has turned his back on acting. In the 1990s, after establishing a fledgling career as a child actor under the name Leaf, he withdrew for a time to travel to Mexico and South America with his father. Then in 1993, following the death by drug overdose of his brother River, Joaquin retreated from the public eye once again after his distraught 911 call to the police was recorded and repeatedly played over the airwaves and on television across the globe.</p> <p>On that occasion it took him a year to return to acting. This time around it looks like the break could be rather longer.</p>",
  "<p>I hate to be a spoilsport, but <a href=\"http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.blogspot.com/2008/10/its-getting-bleaker-for-mccain-worse.html\">this election is over</a>. In six days from now the polling stations will be opening on election day. Later that day - sometime before midnight on the east coast of the United States - Barack Obama will be declared America's 44th president.</p> <p>In fact, not only is this election over, it's in danger of getting <a href=\"http://people-press.org/report/465/mccain-support-declines\">boring</a>.</p> <p>At this point it's customary to insert the usual disclaimers: maybe many more Americans are racist than our worst fears. Maybe Lehman Brothers will uncover a spare $50bn mislaid through an accounting error. Maybe Russia will invade Poland tomorrow. (Readers can envisage their own more horrifying scenarios at this point.) Maybe Obama supporters will read articles such as this and not bother turning out. Or maybe all the opinion polls conducted in the last month were wrong. Writing on Cif yesterday, Dan Kennedy provided a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/28/election-obama-mccain-suppression-race\">compelling round-up</a> of the various pitfalls.</p> <p>Alternatively, as Groucho Marx once suggested: \"Who do you believe - me, or your own eyes?\"</p> <p>Based on every shred of evidence, Obama has won and it is all over bar the voting. The only uncertainty at this point is his margin of victory. This is not something that can be said in public, or even out loud, because all parties - Democrats, Republicans and especially the media - have a vested interested in pretending that, oh, <em>anything</em> could happen. And it might. But it probably won't. Obama's lead is <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">too deep</a> in <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/2008president/\">too many states</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/election_2008/electoral_count_no_toss_ups.html\">too close to polling day</a>.</p> <p>Exhibit Z: the Republican party is now spending money <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/rnc_goes_up_in_montana.php\">running TV ads in Montana</a>. <em>Montana</em>. If the GOP has to spend a dime defending <a href=\"http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?f=0&amp;year=2004&amp;fips=30\">Montana's three electoral college votes</a>, then it really is in more trouble than in the wildest dreams of a Daily Kos diarist.</p> <p>In the meantime we have to pretend it's a close-run thing, partly because it might be but mainly because it makes for better copy. As you read this, teams of journalists are scouring the US hinterland for doleful examples of incipient and not so incipient racism among voters, to frighten their readers and viewers. In fact, here's a handy template for the stuff currently filling the columns of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/us/politics/27pennsylvania.html\">New York Times</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/26/AR2008102601766.html\">Washington Post</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The town of [Insert Name], deep in upstate Ohio/Michigan/Indiana, was once a thriving metropolis, renowned as the centre of America's [manufactured good] industry. But its factories have long closed and their jobs shipped overseas to China/Mexico/Botswana. All that is left are the memories of people such as Local Stereotype. Over a cup of coffee in Typical Diner on [Insert Name's] once thriving Main Street - where six out of every four stores are boarded up - Mr Stereotype said: \"I'm from a family of lifelong Democrats. My Pappy and Grandpappy worked here on the [manufactured good] assembly line. Times are hard now, sure enough. But I ain't voting for no Muslim.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And so on. Repeat over several days and forward to the Pulitzer Prize committee.</p> <p>Indeed, the Republican party has decided not to wait for the votes to be counted and has skipped straight on to the <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5igWA77jTUWXP5cqP7Xy1MDq8I1ZQ\">post-election internecine feuding and bitter recriminations</a>. It saves time.</p> <p>Many pundits will declare that the economic collapse in September was the cause of Obama's victory and McCain's downfall. And up to a point they will be right, although the spectacular Wall Street flameout last month will only account for the size of Obama's victory, not its fact. Let's not forget that the US economy was already tanking well before Lehman Brothers collapse - <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=gUkbdjetlY8\">Bear Stearns</a> went belly-up way back in March, and the disastrous fall in house prices and sharp upward spike in home foreclosures and mortgage defaults began last year (and even earlier, in some regions). Output was already slowing and unemployment was rising long before September's surprise. So the economy would have stunk even without AIG and the rest of the debacle. But that won't stop pundits from claiming that the economy only became a big issue in mid-September. They will be wrong.</p> <p>What really lost McCain the election was that he ran a dreadful campaign - one of the worst in living memory. What was particularly hilarious was the way his team seemed intent on replicating, in every detail, the losing formula pioneered by Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries: first run on experience. Then dismiss Obama as just a good speech-maker. Then make some cack-handed racial slurs. Then claim you are really the better agent of change ... the list goes on. (About the only thing McCain hasn't recycled is the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=N-VFA7L2RcE\">3am phone call ad</a> - and that was Hillary's most effective spot.)</p> <p>Like France's Bourbons, McCain's campaign learned nothing and forgot nothing.</p> <p>Just as Clinton's campaign walked into every trap the Obamanauts laid for it, so too did McCain's. The exception was his feckless choice of Sarah Palin as vice-president - which perhaps damaged him as much as the economy. At a stroke McCain managed to undercut his single biggest advantage over Obama, his years of experience. And Palin's ill-judged and nakedly partisan convention speech instantly shot down any bipartisan appeal to moderate and independent voters. Good work. (Yes, Palin's speech energised the party's base - and that in itself should have set off the alarm bells.)</p> <p>But all this is in the future. Now we have to get back to pretending that Obama hasn't really got this all locked up sometime next Tuesday night.</p>",
  "<h2>G David, Cambridge<br>16, St Edward's Passage, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB2 3PJ<br>01223 354 619</h2> <p>Just a stone's throw from King's College but hidden away in a narrow backstreet behind a picturesquely overgrown graveyard, G David is everything a university town bookshop ought to be. The shelves are well-stocked with academic texts at extremely reasonable prices for the students, and antiquarian books at rather higher prices for the dons, but there's plenty to interest the browser, too - the fine binding sets, in particular. Poetry lovers are particularly well-served with an extensive section that covers hard-to-find small press editions as well as the usual sets of complete works and anthologies. No matter when you visit, you're guaranteed to emerge clutching a bargain.<br><strong>Sarah Crown</strong></p> <p>I don't often allow myself to go there anymore because I always find something I \"have to have\". I have bought, among others, a first edition of Dylan Thomas's second book of poetry, two first edition CS Lewis's and two books from the library of Richard Burton, bound in green suede (given to him as a birthday present by Elizabeth Taylor!) It's simply a treasure - always something interesting from 99p paper backs to \u00a3100 rare first editions. I would be heart-broken if it ever closed.<br><strong>Helen Stear</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.libra-aries-books.co.uk/\">Libra Aires Books, Cambridge</a><br>9 The Broadway, Mill Road, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB1 3AH<br>01223 412 411</h2> <p>Recently opened on cosmopolitan Mill Road is Libra Aires 'Alternative' Bookshop, offering a weird and wonderful collection of books, magazines and pamphlets on everything from earth mysteries, folklore and paganism to green politics and vegetarian cookery. Kids' books, handmade notebooks and cards and even dowsing rods are available, as is an impressive selection of second-hand and remaindered titles. Community events are publicised. The friendly staff are happy to chat, to search for customer requests and offer a mail order service. Occasional book signing events have been held. This funky bookshop is fun and has something for everyone.<br><strong>Scott Hilliard</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.toppingbooks.co.uk/\">Toppings, Ely</a><br>Toppings, 9 High Street, Ely, Cambridgeshire, CB7 4NB<br>01353 645005</h2> <p>A lovely place, particularly on a Sunday, to stop and browse. Having recently extended the shop, stock - including children's and young adults' literature - is excellent. Staff are knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. Evening events are arranged with authors and signed copies are available.<br><strong>Mary Bannister</strong></p> <p>Wonderful selection - a real bookshop with knowledgeable staff. We go every time we are within reach. The stock is superb, idiosyncratic, lots of really interesting older books, not just current mainstream. Beautifully presented, etc etc ...<br><strong>Derek Janes</strong></p> <p>I stopped off in Ely to look at the wonderful cathedral and happened upon Toppings. I was offered tea and cake before I had even started looking. The request for a fairly obscure book was satisfied immediately from a bottom shelf of their packed and well-designed bookshop. I ended up spending over \u00a3100 in the most thoughtfully-stocked bookshop I have seen for many a year. It seemed designed with me in mind which must be the ultimate if rather solipsistic compliment!<br><strong>Mike McGrath</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.peakirkbooks.com/\">Peakirk Books</a><br>15 St Pegas Road, Peakirk, Peterbrorough, Cambridgeshire, PE6 7NF<br>01733 253182</h2> <p>If you love old children's books this is the place for you. A friendly welcome and books stacked floor to ceiling in a special room upstairs - you'll find old friends, rekindle old memories and spend many a happy hour wallowing in nostalgia. What could be better? A real tonic. There is also a large stock of general books - you're bound to come out with something special. Heather and Jeff are always generous with their knowledge and time.<br><strong>Annette York</strong></p> <h2>Hannay, Braintree<br>118 High Street, Braintree, Essex, CM7 1LA<br>01376 322647</h2> <p>This bookshop has served the area very well for 50 years, and is still owned by the same family. The staff believe that the needs of the customer are paramount, and nothing is too much trouble them. Some have worked there for years and years, and know just which firm to deal with to fulfill special orders. Good manners, courtesy and know-how are a good combination, and it's these qualities that make Hannay more unique with each passing year. Braintree would be the poorer without it.<br><strong>Constance Turner</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bookservice.biz/\">The Bargain Bookshop, Chingford</a><br>135 Station Road, Chingford, Essex, E4 6AG<br>020 8524 9002</h2> <p>What this bijou store lacks in space it more than makes up for in personal service and charm. The helpful staff can order what you want through their speedy computer often for the next day. Bev Tankard, the owner, and her enthusiastic team have a great community spirit and links with local schools, inspiring young readers with their save-and-buy book club. There is a loyalty card scheme that keeps customers returning, an email alert service for regular customers, and late open evenings for special occasions. What a very special little shop!<br><strong>Carole Cross</strong></p> <h2>Greyfriars Books, Colchester<br>92 East Hill, Colchester, Essex, CO1 2QN<br>01206 563138</h2> <p>The Victorian yellow brick building is built near the site of the city's Roman East Gate and a later medieval Franciscan monastery. Steps down from the busy street lead to a discrete basement entrance and a world of books, the walls lined with an endlessly fascinating collection from all fields. The travel writing and local history collections are excellent, or you can pick up a 50-year-old gardening book for under \u00a310 that holds more useful information than a series of Groundforce. Though it has just a few rooms, it nonetheless has a labyrinthine and mysterious feel, extending further into another basement room, with fiction of all sorts and an extensive biography section, then upstairs into rooms of philosophy, entertainment, art and photography, and more. The staff kindly offer help finding books in any subject. Its one of my favorite bookshops.<br><strong>Jeff Geiger</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.redlionbooks.co.uk/\">Red Lion Books, Colchester</a><br>125 High St, Colchester, Essex, CO1 1SZ<br>01206 578584</h2> <p>A bookshop in the centre of Colchester. There are two Waterstone's and numerous other competitors, yet they have carved out a niche and filled it with a loyal and knowledgeable customer base. One of the best things is that while specialisation is obviously a protection from the chains it often leads to a retreat from the main stream: not so in this case. The shop is family owned and run by a disparate staff, all united (naturally) by a love of books. Both of the owners are heavily involved in the book trade (Peter is on the National Booksellers Committee). Their position is buoyed by a close relationship with authors, both local and national. Terry Pratchett is the most high profile guest; Red Lion Books was the only independent bookshop on his last tour. Shops like these are as much a labour of love as they are a business and should be celebrated.<br><strong>Robin Donaldson</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.biblio.com/bookstores/lgb.html\">Leigh Gallery Books, Leigh-on-Sea</a><br>135-137 Leigh Road, Leigh-On-Sea, Essex, SS9 1JQ<br>01702 715 477</h2> <p>Secondhand bookshops are the opposite of the usual shops - you don't go there looking for something; you go for something to find you. The unique Gallery bookstore is metonymy incarnate, because like most bookstores of its ilk, you wade through stacks of paperbacks and yellows before you come across something amazing. The staff are decent - it's family-run, I think, and they remember you. Still, after many years between visits, they tell me about their new acquisitions in my area of interest. Best of all, in summer, they have a little table outside, under a small canopy in case of rain, on which they stack the least expensive books. That little table is out all night long, with a tin in which one is asked to place a pound. When it gets light, there are slightly fewer books and slightly more pound coins. There's not much to recommend this little seaside town - a few ok pubs and the driven estuary. And this hidden treasure, this topographical baroquism. Go there.<br><strong>Francis Deamer</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://wivenhoebooks.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.web/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=wivenhoebooks&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000091&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">Wivenhoe Bookshop, Wivenhoe</a><br>23 High Street, Wivenhoe, Essex, CO7 9BE<br>01206 824050</h2> <p>A population of 10,000 with branches of major chains only three miles away in Colchester: not very promising for a very small bookshop. How does it survive?<br>1. Stock enormously varied.<br>2. Titles not in stock ordered from a wholesalers who usually deliver within 48 hours, often the next day.<br>3. Staff are enthusiastic and knowledgeable readers.<br>4. Local writers are promoted with launch parties and signing sessions.<br>5. Local history is particularly well covered - often a nightmare area in the chains.<br>6. Exhibitions by local artists.<br>7. Fantastic website - order online.<br>8.

Fall into a conversation with the owner and what began as a 30-minute exploration of the Hanratty case becomes a funny and enthralling two-hour discussion on anything you like. You can also sit undisturbed for hours, leafing through the books you want, and leave with them all for under a tenner. It's a gem.<br><strong>Andrew Peeld</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.aldeburghbookshop.co.uk/\">The Aldeburgh Bookshop, Aldeburgh</a><br>42 High Street, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, IP15 5AB<br>01728 452389</h2> <p>There's been a bookshop on this site for many years, but the current proprietors, Johnny and Mary James, are exceptionally well-informed and well-read and will order anything they haven't got in stock. Local authors and interests, including the year-round musical activities at Snape Maltings up the road, are well represented, and there's a good children's section with room to sit cross-legged and browse. The Jameses have launched an annual Literary Weekend, now in its fourth year and extremely popular. Their own idiosyncratic tastes led them, for example, to be well in the vanguard of Alexander McCall Smith appreciation - he had the whole of Suffolk eating from the palm of his hand when he gave a talk at the Literary Weekend in 2003 - and Aldeburgh sales of his No 1 Ladies Detective Agency books must contribute substantially to his royalties.<br><strong>Henrietta Bredin</strong></p> <p>When I go in there thinking there are no more books I want to read, I always find one that I do. Furthermore, it's usually on the table by the door. When I am looking for a particular book, they always seem to have it in stock - it's almost as if they run the shop just for me. The shop itself is reasonably big and quite airy and has a lovely children's section. It has all of the traditional qualities of independent bookshops without rubbing them in; the whole thing is done with a light touch. This, I think, is because it is run by a couple who know their stuff and understand the needs of their customers - or of this one at least. Finally, their literary festival is stellar this year, featuring Clive Anderson, Sally Beauman, Beryl Bainbridge, Tony Benn, Lady Antonia Fraser, Harold Pinter and Anthony Sampson, among others.<br><strong>Nick Lerner</strong></p> <p>A wonderful discovery - not only many books that I want to buy, but also a marvellous atmosphere of people interested in reading. If you linger in one of the inviting armchairs, you can find yourself contributing ideas to satisfy the blossoming literary interests of a 10-year-old - but you also have the opportunity to browse unhindered, unless you ask a question when the staff are both helpful and knowledgeable. The bookshop is also fantastic as a remote user: books are ordered and dispatched with efficiency; no textbook too obscure.<br><strong>Anthea Palmer</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bardsleysbooks.com/\">Bardsley's Books, Bungay</a><br>22, Upper Olland Street, Bungay, Suffolk, NR35 1BH<br>01986 892077</h2> <p>I stumbled across this fabulous mess of a bookstore while working for a publishing company, going there to sell books and ending up buying instead. Something of an archetypal second-hand bookshop, around 90% of the floor space is taken up with waist-high piles of books, creating an almost labyrinthine atmosphere as you search and shovel your way to undreamed of treasures and jump with joy as you realise that you have finally completed your Martin Amis collection for the astonishing price of \u00a313.50. I have only ever been to Bardsley's once, but it will probably be the reason that I will holiday in Suffolk rather than the US this year - although I will still be taking the statutory empty suitcase.<br><strong>Ian Shine</strong></p> <h2>Chapel Books (aka Bob's Bookshop), Saxmundham<br>The Street, Westleton, Saxmundham, Suffolk, IP17 3AA<br>01728 648616</h2> <p>Apart from the wide-ranging and eclectic selection of books, both modern and antiquarian, any bookshop where you summon the proprietor by banging a tin can with the stick provided is alright with me. Several battered sofas are supplied for reading on, and Bob often comes out to ask whether any browsers would like a tea or coffee. The shop even sells vinyl records (of varying quality). Potential thieves should take note of the sign warning that if you steal a book, when you leave the shop an alarm will go off in your head.<br><strong>Jonathan Paige </strong></p>",
  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.erictmoore.co.uk/\">Eric T Moore Books, Hitchin</a><br>24 Bridge St, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, SG5 2DF<br>01462 450497</h2> <p>The reasons for nominating this bookshop are too many to cram into 100 words. It has lost none of its charm in the 25 years I have been frequenting it, and under the energetic vision of its new manager it looks set to continue the tradition established by Mr Moore. It lies in one of Hitchin's most characterful locations, and houses more books than you could dream of, in what are two adjoining cottages. A stone's throw from the market place, but inhabiting the old centre frequented by Elizabethan George Chapman, it has an earthy olde worlde feel impossible to imitate or recapture in a dull hybrid global chain, and is now open on Sundays, when I will take my baby boy to browse when he grows older. The shop holds titles as diverse as first editions of cult local historian Reginald Hine and fantastic zipgun affordable paperbacks. A gem in a gem of a town which relies on such visionaries.<br><strong>Dr Marino Guida</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.davids-bookshops.co.uk/\">David's Bookshop, Letchworth Garden City</a><br>14 East Cheap, Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, SG6 3DP<br>01462 684631</h2> <p>It's not only a fine source of new and second-hand books with a friendly atmosphere and helpful staff, it's also a hallowed Letchworth institution that plays a valuable role in a sleepy community through its many activities. It buys up your old books in piles; it organises debates on topics of national or local interest; it sponsors book-readings, talks and book launches by locally-based authors; it gives 10% discounts to members of the Letchworth leisure and recreation group that itself sponsors many activities; twice a year it has days when it sells all books at 30% or 50% off; it opens seven days a week and stays open for long hours - and if you're lucky it may even give your teenage son or daughter a holiday job.<br><strong>Andrew Tarnowski</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.altonbooks.co.uk/\">Little Green Dragon Bookshop, Alton</a><br>3 Normandy Street, Alton, Hampshire, GU34 1DD<br>01420 87801</h2> <p>This little gem of a bookshop is shot through with the personal touch of its owners, Jackie and Christine. It is small, cosy and welcoming, while housing a seemingly impossible range of books: reference, classics, the interesting but little known, and titles that are currently making the news. Knowledgeable advice is always available for those seeking ideas and inspiration. Telephone or email orders arrive within a couple of days, postage free. The shop is intimately involved in the life of the town as a meeting point and nerve centre, hosting literary events, acting as box office for local productions, and supporting local authors. It is also the place to go for cards, wrapping paper, and especially for high quality art materials. It is always a joy to visit, but like most such establishments it needs all the support it so richly deserves.<br><strong>James Willis</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://fordingbridgebooks.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.web/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=fordingbridgebooks&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000135&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">Fordingbridge Bookshop, Fordingbridge</a><br>15 Salisbury Street, Fordingbridge, Hampshire, SP6 1AB<br>01425 653725</h2> <p>I first entered this bookshop at the age of 11. \"I've got to write down the books I want for this prize I won at school,\" I told the shop owner, in a trembling voice, \"but then they buy them somewhere else so I won't actually spend the money here.\" She spent over an hour helping me search her stock for books I really wanted to own. The result? A devoted customer. Twenty years, two undergraduate degrees and one PhD later, I have found no better bookshop, even in Oxford or Cambridge. Swift, efficient, friendly. A family business run by discerning booklovers.

They all have books, so what makes this one the best? It is its ethos, its ambience, the experience of bookishness. Do they have absolutely everything? No. But can they get it and ring next day to say its in? Yes! I want a bookshop with a smile, to be welcomed, to know names, to get advice, comment, reviews. I want a cup of coffee I want to find like-minded people. And a book club evening meeting. And an art gallery. It's all there.<br><strong>Gordon Lennox</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://volumes.co.uk/\">Volumes Bookshop, Romsey</a><br>27 Bell Street, Romsey, Hampshire, SO51 8GY<br>01794 516404</h2> <p>I love Volumes for many reasons. As you walk in you are greeted by friendly staff. The husband-and-wife owners are young and very down to earth. If you are looking for anything in particular they will go out of their way to help you, and if they don't stock the books you want, you can order them knowing that they'll be in by the next day. They stock a good range of children's, teenage, and adult books along with non-fiction. On the second floor they have maps and travel books as well as CDs and artist materials. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed and they cater for people of all ages. On Wednesday mornings they have story time, to which you can bring your toddlers and rest from your shopping on the second floor in their fairtrade caf\u00e9, in which the coffees, juices and biscuits are all fairtrade while the wonderful cakes are all home made. The prices are all very reasonable. Well worth the visit!<br><strong>Alice Gould</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.octoberbooks.org/\">October Books, Southampton</a><br>243 Portswood Road, Southampton, Hampshire, SO17 2NG<br>023 8058 1030</h2> <p>A great shop, selling books, lefty political stuff, LGBT info and entertainment, fair trade goodies (the chocolate!) and all sorts. In some ways, it's more a lifestyle choice than a bookshop, but it's great to have a little bit of independent thought in the middle of a sprawling town.<br>Becky John</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bookwells.co.uk/\">P &amp; G Wells Ltd, Winchester</a><br>11 College Street, Winchester, Hampshire, SO23 9LZ<br>01962 852016</h2> <p>Surrounded by the formal medieval buildings of Winchester College, the slightly austere fa?e of the P&amp;G Wells bookshop makes it look quite at home. Inside there is a good range of contemporary fiction and biography, but where Wells really comes up trumps is with its children's section: the first floor is completely dedicated to books for kids of all ages. The history, philosophy and classical sections are also strong (Wells still supplies all the educational books for the college next door) and for real bibliophiles there's a bookbinding and restoration workshop at the back of the shop.<br><strong>Sam Spedding</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.beckenhambooks.co.uk/\">The Beckenham Bookshop, Beckenham</a><br>42 High Street, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 1AY<br>020 8650 9744</h2> <p>A suburban high street can still be a treat to shop on, especially if there is a good bookshop to visit. Beckenham is a town with just such a thing. It is a small shop but manages to have a great range of books and really friendly and helpful staff. One of the most remarkable things is their willingness to order books for you that mostly turn up the very next day. The first time you get a phone call to say your book is in, just 24 hours after ordering it, is quite staggering. They also have a mailing list and once you join that you can expect a regular supply of news about new books and events at the shop.<br><strong>Peter Starky</strong></p> <p>Our friendly little bookshop offers a brilliant variety of books. I particularly like browsing the new titles there, and the excellent range of children's books. As a literature student, I order all the books I need from the store and always receive them within two days. As well as being an excellent bookshop, the owners have made the shop a real community commodity through regular newsletters (you can sign up when browsing in the shop) highlighting new books and offers. Just before Christmas, there is always late opening with mulled wine and mince pies ....a real delight!<br><strong>Bea Mehta</strong></p> <p>The main reasons for nominating this bookshop are:<br>friendly, helpful service - their recommendations are always good<br>a cross-section of books<br>discounts and special offers<br>an especially good range of children's books<br>excellent ordering service, with fast delivery (usually within 24 to 48 hours!)<br>great atmosphere.<br>Any bookworms in the area should pay them a visit - you probably won't leave empty handed!<br><strong>Dave and Karen</strong></p> <p>A treasure in today's world of chain bookshops. A small shop, independently owned and run by a delightful woman with a wonderful accent, with helpers who take an interest and know their stock. There is always something good to browse, and if they don't have what you're looking for, will get it quickly and without fuss. They will even post it to you if you don't want to collect. I wouldn't do that myself, as it would mean missing an opportunity of another visit to the shop!<br><strong>Anon</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://sandwichbookshop.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.direct/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=sandwichbookshop&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000110&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">The Sandwich Bookshop, Sandwich</a><br>60 King Street, Sandwich, Kent, CT13 9BL<br>01304 620404</h2> <p>A gem of a place - with the motto 'I think therefore I read' - based in an atmospheric old grocery store tucked away in this ancient cinque port. Spend hours browsing shelves packed with everything from bestsellers to the quirky and unusual, such as titles from the beautifully produced Persephone Books, which publishes 'forgotten fiction and non-fiction by unjustly neglected authors'. Local authors, book readings and signings feature regularly. There is a discount scheme plus a fast and efficient ordering service, as well as a website for online browsers. But the shop's the thing - a real treat.<br><strong>Stephen Elves</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.sevenoaksbookshop.co.uk/\">Sevenoaks Bookshop, Sevenoaks</a><br>147 High Street, Sevenoaks, Kent, TN13 1XJ<br>01732 452055</h2> <p>We have a wonderful book shop in Sevenoaks ... we really do love it. They know the book you want almost before you describe it, the staff are consistently available, welcoming, knowledgeable and infinitely tolerant of dogs, children and foibles. Their eclectic customers are dedicated, demanding and never disappointed - the shop even has a loyalty card scheme. It's been the same for years - after all, why change a winning formula? It's the jewel in the crown in our high street. You can happily spend hours there.<br><strong>The Sevenoaks Book Club</strong></p> <p>Sevenoaks is blessed with the best bookshop for 50 miles - and we are only 25 miles from Charing Cross. No bookshop is better than its people, and that is where they have the edge. The co-proprietors wear their ownership lightly, and inspire loyalty in their predominently long-serving staff. Mere competence, even of the highest order, is subordinate to the evident desire to serve, however trifling the request and however great the provocation. Any modest shortcomings are at once made good with unfailingly good-natured charm.<br><strong>Michael Howard</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.hallsbookshop.com/\">Halls Bookshop, Tunbridge Wells</a><br>20 Chapel Place, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, TN1 1YQ<br>01892 527 842</h2> <p>Established in 1898, Halls is a fantastic secondhand bookshop that sells everything from antiquarian rarities to 50p bargains. The two floors contain excellent literature, biography, history and travel sections, as well as many other subjects. Halls boasts as good a selection as many of the antiquarian bookshops on Charing Cross Road, but at half the price and with none of the attitude.<br><strong>Rupert Russell</strong></p> <h2>Bookist, Whitstable<br>138 Tankerton Road, Whitstable, Kent, CT5 2AN<br>01227 272454</h2> <p>I heartily recommend Bookist, a superb new and remaindered bookshop. The pleasing depth of children's titles, large print and non-fiction books is excellent. They specialise in hard-to-find, and the prices when they do find is great. They import remainders from Canada and the US with pricing that shames other shops! There's an obligatory leather sofa for rainy afternoons. Each time I visit I buy a book even though I've only stopped for a browse - today I completed my son's collection of Simpsons books and bought five jacketless hardbacks at ?1.99 each. Now there's a bargain!<br><strong>Becky Talbot</strong></p> <h2>Harbour Books, Whitstable<br>21 Harbour St, Whitstable, Kent, CT5 1AQ<br>01227 264011</h2> <p>I love Harbour Books because it's conveniently located on the way from my house to anywhere in Whitstable. It stocks cheap copies of some wonderful books: I've recently bought David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas, a whole load of Alan Hollinghursts, a couple of Angela Carters and Gillian Slovo's (Ice Road). These may not be your taste, but they have loads of other stuff too. Harbour Books is tiny, but the staff are lovely. After only a couple of nudges, they've started a shelf on \"lesbian and gay interest\" books, which, considering they're the size of a postage stamp, is very cool of them.<br><strong>Emily Grabham</strong></p> <h2>Houben's Bookshop, Richmond<br>2 Church Court, Surrey, TW9 1JL</h2> <p>Houben's is a brilliant combination bookshop with an eclectic selection of new books on the ground floor and an equally eclectic selection of used books in the basement. Upstairs, the shop contains a strong philosophy section, quirky fiction choices and a good assortment of Folio Society publications. However, the real gems are in the basement. There's a fabulous selection of nicely priced classics (they obviously have a good eye for interesting editions and bindings, as well as unusual titles), poetry and a well-honed fiction section. I have never left the shop empty-handed.<br><strong>Kate Eberwein</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://muchadobooks.com/index.php\">Much Ado Books, Alfriston</a><br>1 Steamer Cottage, High Street, Alfriston, East Sussex, BN26 5TY<br>01323 871 222</h2> <p>Owned and run by my dear friends Cate Olson and Nash Robbins, Much Ado is a bright, unexpectedly large shop in a 14th-century building combining new books with secondhand, and packed with interesting stock. Please don't tell the owners they ought to have a cafe (it drives them nuts) but you can see why people suggest it. It's a shop where you want to take your time, have a sit-down, read all morning. Very good on fiction, Bloomsbury, children's. Did you know Stella Gibbons wrote Cold Comfort Farm in Alfriston? You learn something new every day.<br><strong>Lynne Truss</strong></p> <h2>Arundel Bookshop, Arundel<br>10 High Street, Arundel, West Sussex, BN18 9AB<br>01903 882680</h2> <p>The best secondhand bookshop in Britain - outside Hay, anyway. Catch the train from Victoria and spend the day there. When I was working at the youth hostel in Arundel, I spent many happy hours reading on the dusty stairs during my afternoons off. Much of the stuff hasn't been opened for years.<br><strong>Ros Taylor</strong></p> <p>The Arundel Bookshop, which Ros Taylor enjoyed visiting, clearly some years ago, has changed hands. It is now called Kim's Bookshop, and still has a huge and varied wealth of books on the shelves, but has been tidied, so no longer has dusty stairs.<br><strong>Jeffery Meddle</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.city-books.co.uk/\">City Books, Brighton</a><br>23 Western Rd, Brighton, East Sussex, BN3 1AF<br>01273 725306</h2> <p>As a reader I can get lost for hours in the store - with its glorious odour of book - as a writer this is the way I want my books sold. Paul Sweetman is as knowledgeable about books as anyone can be and still have bones rather than pages. He persuades the world's writers to talk about their work in an un-stagemanaged fashion that leaves the multiples lagging. City Books allowed me to laugh at Alexander McCall Smith's tales of bassoon playing and marvelled at Louis de Berniere's thoughtful, elegant answers to questions about magical realism and political activism.<br><strong>Kay Sexton</strong></p> <p>Everything a bookshop should be. Going for at least 30 years, it is small, helpful and restful, with an excellent, well-edited choice of modern fiction, children's reading, cult, reference, local authors and fantastic ordering service and frequent reader promotion. Excellent selection of cards (including self-published) and it now has smart coffee and buns upstairs in the philosophy department so there is no need to go home, ever. In-house dog. Right next to the pub.<br><strong>Viv Croot</strong></p> <h2>Mungle's Jungle, Brighton<br>12 Guildford Road, Brighton, East Sussex, BN1 3FA<br>01273 739373</h2> <p>Mungle's Jungle, a fantastic little children's bookshop by anyone's standards, is elevated far beyond the competition purely on the basis of its proprietor, Jane Shepard. The shop, although small, is always well stocked, but Jane's knowledge and enthusiasm are key here, never failing to find the perfect book for any request. Running a story time for kids on a Saturday afternoon, she is passionate about instilling a love of reading in children of all ages and this shines through in everything she does. Simply a wonderful little shop.<strong>Dan Slessor</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.kemptownbookshop.co.uk/\">Kemptown Bookshop, Brighton<br>91 St. George's Rd, Brighton, East Sussex, BN2 1EE<br>01273 682110</a></h2> <p>In this lovely bookshop, the genuinely warm friendliness of proprietor Darion Goodwin and his ever-happy dog, Meghan, provide a much-needed oasis from all the impersonal book-hypermarkets. The knowledgeable selection of titles is a testament to Mr. Goodwin's passion for books. Upstairs is the shop's own Bookroom Cafe which is elegant and serene; while surrounded by even more books, you can relax with a fine range of pastries and light refreshments. A second-hand and out-of print book ordering service, greeting cards and book-related gifts mean Kemptown bookshop meets all your reading requirements. This really is a booklover's bookshop.<br><strong>Isobel Hiom</strong></p> <h2>Bookstack, Eastbourne<br>67-68 Arndale Centre, East Sussex, BN21 3NW<br>01323 430 554</h2> <p>This independent has taken on the big discounters and survived. Sandwiched between branches of Sussex Stationers and Ottakar's, with a WHSmith and Waterstone's not far away, he manages to keep a good selection of bestsellers and non-fiction, much of it as discounted as at his competitors.. For me, the best feature is the slightly quirky collection of non-fiction, particularly art titles, although he also has a good range of cookery, military history, education/reference and local interest. If you like popular fiction, this is discounted, with plenty of classics as well. Upstairs there is a lovely little cafe, with cakes made by a local woman and free coffee refills, as well as the day's papers, local and national. A civilised refuge in a wilderness of Mothercare, Next, and assorted teen fashion shops.<br><strong>Denise Scott Fears</strong></p> <h2>Camilla's Bookshop, Eastbourne<br>57 Grove Road, Eastbourne, East Sussex<br>01323 736001</h2> <p>This amazing secondhand bookshop greets you with books piled all over the floor, and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. It is a wonderful labyrinthine cavern to lose yourself in for hours on its three floors (don't miss the basement). Books on all topics imaginable and staff who seem to know where every one is. When I'm having a bad day I like to go in there for a browse, knowing I won't be able to leave without buying some gem or other. I have been known to compete with friends over who will come out with a famous pink carrier bag. Not usually a problem to fill one!<br><strong>Karen Hampson</strong></p> <h2>Spearman Books, Robertsbridge<br>Mellstock, Saxonwood Road, Robertsbridge, East Sussex, TN33 0EY<br>01424773300</h2> <p>Spearman Books is thoroughly recommended to all second-hand book browsers. The small village shop has a wide and very reasonably priced selection ranging from classic children's books, novels and hardback volumes - particularly Kipling - to art books and first editions. There is a wide selection of books on the military and local history. The owners, Janet and John, are exceptionally helpful and well informed and will order books for you if they can not be found. Definitely worth an afternoon visit.<br><strong>M Woolf</strong></p> <h2>Martello Bookshop, Rye<br>26 High Street, Rye, Sussex, TN31 7JJ<br>01797 222242</h2> <p>This is a really nice shop. It's only small but it has a great range it contemporary fiction, and is very open, too. It also hosts a lot of signings, and exhibitions, and I gather it also runs its own bookclub. Great section on local history too, if that's your thing.<br><strong>Andy Brockie</strong></p> <p>A quirky collection, so you're always able to buy interesting and apposite presents for friends. Impeccable ordering service. Excellent local section of local books and maps. Good on local and visiting authors. Sells books associated with the Rye Festival after talks. A delightful place for browsing.<br><strong>Terry Burke</strong></p> <h2>Badgers Books, Worthing<br>8-10 Gratwicke Road, Worthing, West Sussex, BN11 4BH<br>01903 211816</h2> <p>There's a warm ambience while browsing the large and varied stock, shelved from ground to ceiling, in several rooms. Enjoy the discovery of book 'wants' and 'needs', with often a surprise or two. There's excellent advice on hand when needed from the proprietors, Ray and Meriel. All this, plus reasonable prices, makes Badgers Books the best secondhand and antiquarian bookshop in the south-east. Visitors should not overlook the impressive and ever-changing window display.<br><strong>Jeff Meddle</strong></p> <p>A veritable literary Aladdin's cave, catering for all manner of tastes, Badgers has long been an especial favourite of my father, brother and I; childhood memories of timeless hours browsing the large stock (with the added excitement that the books were affordable on our pocket money - and still are) mean that, as adults, we now pleasurably suffer from compulsive book-purchasing. Knowledgeable and friendly advice from Ray, plus occasional rarities in the crime fiction section, make Badgers a bibliophile's delight.<br><strong>Dan Harding</strong></p>",

None of your Dan Brown nonsense: this little shop is stocked to the rafters with beautiful editions of Hardy, Eliot, Trollope ... There's also a fine stock of books by one of my favourite 20th-century authors, Mervyn Peake. This shops could have been designed for me - I urge every 19th-century literature enthusiast to visit it!<br><strong>Ian Lane</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://childrensbookshop.com/index.shtml\">The Children's Bookshop</a><br>Toll Cottage, Pontvaen, Hay-on-Wye, Herefordshire, HR3 5EW<br>01497 821 083</h2> <p>Particularly memorable for me as I managed to find a copy of Joyce Wood's classic Grandmother Lucy and Her Hats here, after years of fruitless searching. This is a wonderful, wonderful shop - a treasure chest of children's books. Children will love it, of course, and I defy any adult to go in and not come out clutching a copy of a long-forgotten childhood favourite.<br><strong>Anita Fields</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.haycinemabookshop.co.uk/\">Hay Cinema Bookshop</a><br>Castle Street, Hay-on-Wye, Herefordshire, HR3 5DF<br>01497 820071</h2> <p>Now that I live in California, my chances of getting to Hay-on-Wye are limited in the extreme. However, the Cinema Bookshop is it for me. Hours of wonderful browsing time, and many interesting discoveries. Who knows, maybe it would be possible to find a copy of Instant Light: Tarkovsky Polaroids there. If so, it would be worth the trip. An honourable mention also goes to a bookshop the name of which I can't remember - it specialises in gardening books, and it's opposite the chip shop.<br><strong>Chris Gibbons</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.richardbooth.demon.co.uk/outlets.htm\">The Limited</a><br>44 Lion Street, Hay-on-Wye, Herefordshire, HR3 5AA<br>01497 820322</h2> <p>There is no better bookshop in Hay than Richard Booth's shop in Lion Street. Just to walk into its vast space and sometimes (depending upon my mood) overwhelming number of books leaves me feeling humble and excited. I'm often in a panic at where to start, but the helpful staff calm me and set me off in the right direction. Even if I can't find the much-longed-for book I came in for, I leave with something else and am just as happy to have found a treasure which will live on my bookshelf (after I have read it) until someone begs to borrow it and I relent, knowing I can probably get another copy from Booths' if, by chance, they don't return it or it comes back shabby.<br><strong>Julie</strong></p> <p>A fantastic shop with a wide range of second-hand books and I never leave (after ages of browsing) without finding a new \"treasure\". Not only that, the staff are so helpful that it makes book hunting a real pleasure. I can't recommend this shop highly enough.<br><strong>Lucinda Choat</strong></p> <p>Richard Booth's flagship bookshop offers blissful browsings through millions of books. Staffed by knowledgeable - and often eccentric - staff, if you're lucky you might be served by the King of Hay himself. A visit to The Limited is always rewarding for me. I never come away empty handed. With the help of Michael Cottrill, the literature expert, I've made a good collection of Robert Graves's first editions.<br><strong>Hope Booth</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.poetrybookshop.co.uk/\">The Poetry Bookshop</a><br>Ice House, Brook St, Herefordshire, HR3 5BQ<br>01497 821812</h2> <p>Set up by Anne Stevenson when she lived in Hay in the 1970s, this is THE bookshop for poetry enthusiasts up for the festival. It has every conceivable poetry title, as well as books on poets and critical works - I've lost entire afternoons among the shelves. This year, they're apparently hosting a poetry fringe festival in the shop itself - definitely something to keep an eye on!<br><strong>Caroline Hamish </strong></p>",

  "<p>\"It's better to be rich and healthy than sick and poor,\" a Russian saying goes. Looking at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/russia-deripaska-conservatives\">Oleg Deripaska</a> in the last week, I am not sure. His entertainment value proved too good to be missed, making him a pawn in the British media blame game.</p> <p>One undeniable thing in this palaver is the Russian reputation for glamour. A billionaire with a yacht, <a href=\"http://yachts.monacoeye.com/yachtsbysize/pages/queenk01.html\">Queen K</a>, where Peter Mandelson attended a drinks party, off the island of Corfu in August, is a perfect stick for politicos to beat each other with. The worse Deripaska looks, the better it is for political battles. Imagine if Bill Gates was the yacht's owner? They would have played a computer game while drinking diet Coke. How nerdy. But the RusAL owner with a turbulent past is more fun. </p> <p>Thus, there is a vested interest in portraying Deripaska in the worst possible light and distort whatever facts can be found to show him as a bandit. This makes it easier to bring the \"dodgy connections\" charge against those who have drunk a cup of tea out of his hands. Why would anyone want to establish the truth if sensationalism brings a juicy scandal which drags on? </p> <p>It transpired that British politicians have something in common with the Russian ones: both like yachts and want to experience things they perhaps dreamt about since childhood. Maybe there was nothing sinister about Mandelson wanting to go on a yacht: he simply could not resist the temptation. Politicians are like children sometimes. But these Tories went to the yacht because they smelt money, irrespective of how actively the donation was solicited or proposed. </p> <p>I never thought I would be sorry for an oligarch, but this is how I feel. Politicians here make a career of kicking a Russian. Everybody feels they should be holier than others. Lord Tebbit, the former Tory chairman, lectures Osborne: \"As shadow chancellor you do not go on to yachts with Russian oligarchs. If you sleep with dogs you will get fleas.\" Now, because of the Tories' imprudence, dirt is dug out and Russophobia gets another boost. Deripaska's spokesman stated that \"he has always said he has no intention of getting involved with British politics\". I fully endorse the sentiment. </p> <p>The incredible thing for the Russian public was the size of the allegedly solicited donation. \u00a350,000! How far that would go? Deripaska's fortune is estimated at \u00a316 billion. These Tories really do come cheap. </p> <p>LibDems suddenly \u2013 and uncharacteristically for them \u2013 appealed to US wisdom. They remind us that Deripaska has been denied a US visa. Is there something the Americans know that Mandelson and the Tories should have? <a href=\"http://www.vincentcable.org.uk/\">Mr Cable</a> warns of a danger to British taxpayers if they acquire a 25% stake in Norilsk Nickel, a flagship of the Russian aluminium industry. RBS, the partly state-owned bank, lent money to Deripaska who can default on his debt. In this case the Russian state would most probably pick up the bill, so the plant stays in Russian ownership. I hope that Mr Cable suggests doing a decent thing to reject both the stake and the Kremlin's money. He would be most welcome in Russia.</p> <p>Now Russia is welcoming Peter Mandelson on an official four-day visit to Moscow. The public found his lordship deeply intriguing. He promised to give an interview to the liberal Ekho Moskvy (Moscow Echo) radio station. Listeners posted questions on the station's website. Did he like the yacht? What's so attractive about meeting with oligarchs? Did he ever meet a Russian writer, a composer, a doctor \u2013 someone who actually created something useful? What should Russia do to get the British government to like it? Mandelson's lordship is also fascinating. Russians dealt with their aristocracy in 1917. One asks: \"Sir, you are a lord. Does this mean that I, a commoner, am a worse man than you? And if not, why mention your title?\" Sadly, the Russian public would not get their answers \u2013 the interview was cancelled last night due to a \"busy schedule\".</p> <p>Long overdue, there are first signs of improvement in Anglo\u2013Russian relations since the polonium poisoning scandal nearly two years ago. A new British ambassador, Anne Pringle, has taken over from Tony Brenton, who himself became a media story in Russia. This month the British Council has been rehabilitated over back taxes. However, the more time elapses, a full restoration of the relationship gets more difficult, as stereotypes and vested interests on both sides become more entrenched. Would Peter Mandelson's visit and his reluctance to engage with ordinary Russians be another missed opportunity?</p>",
  "<p>Over the last 30 years, each and every major international financial crisis has visited Hungary. In 1982, right after Poland; in 1994, right after Mexico; and in 2008, right after Iceland. Always, and rapidly, the road has led to the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>This is a special relationship indeed, and also a turbulent one. Most of the former Eastern Bloc countries joined the IMF and the World Bank after 1989, but Hungary did so as early as 1982. It helped to push forward market reforms that others were yet to adopt, and thus Hungary became a model pupil of neoliberalism in the region. It did not, however, help the country get out of its massive foreign debt. Hungary entered the post-communist \"new era\" with the highest per capita foreign debt and, unlike Poland, the government decided to refrain from potential debt reduction schemes put forward by George Soros among others.</p> <p>Despite being the most economically advanced of the countries that joined the EU in 2004, Hungary has always remained the most financially vulnerable. In the early period, debt to GDP increased rather than decreased, and the Maastricht type debt ratio only reduced (to about 51%) in a period of extraordinary foreign direct investment in the late 1990s. As other nations made themselves available for transnational corporations, however, this competitive edge vanished.</p> <p>There are further reasons why Hungary has turned out to be the region's weakest link in the current international financial crisis. Since GDP only caught up with the 1989 level in 1999, successive governments turned to risky financial solutions to improve the popular feelgood factor. One government unleashed reckless subsidy schemes for home builders and buyers; another increased public sector wages by 50%. Meanwhile, an ambitious road construction programme left Hungary with the best highway network in the region, but at the price of skyrocketing state debt.</p> <p>It was, however, not only fiscal policy that contributed to its fatal fragility; monetary policy also played a part. In 2001, the central bank (MNB) adopted the \"inflation targeting\" paradigm, which was never invented for small, open economies, totally dependent on foreign trade, investment and finance. MNB did not give up on this concept even in the spring of this year, when central banks around the world had repeatedly reduced interest rates. </p> <p>Similarly, nothing happened to reduce the amount of foreign exchange-based domestic lending, which was pointed out several times by international observers as a source of financial instability \u2013 and which also contributed to the unsustainable strength of the forint.</p> <p>Add the hostility and lack of cooperation, sometimes even dialogue, between the two main political parties, plus the uncertainty around the minority government currently in office, and you can understand how comparison is possible with Ukraine or Pakistan, alongside whom we currently sit in the IMF emergency room.</p> <p>What is different from previous crises is the global financial architecture \u2013 ie the collection of multilateral institutions, as well as governments, that step forward for stabilisation against the unprecedented hysteria of transnational private finance. Also, the relationship between the IMF and particular clients is also affected by the fact that the IMF is not the only player in town. Sovereign wealth funds have joined the picture, albeit with an unclarified role so far. This may affect the conditionality of IMF loans and prevent a replay of the 1980s, when all costs of the reckless lending by multinational banks were pushed on emerging economies, which suffered depression and disintegration as a result.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the emerging Hungarian package is largely based on the old orthodoxy. This is probably because, of the three main areas of earlier overspending (housing, motorways and wage increases), the third is the one that can be most easily driven out of existence. This will be seen as ruthless, primarily because the country has just left behind two years of deficit reduction from 10% to 3% of the GDP \u2013 a heroic achievement from the government and the people.</p> <p>The financial crisis in Hungary and across Europe also shows that the eurozone's enlargement strategy has to change. When the eight new countries joined the EU in 2004, they were obliged to sign up to the Economic and Monetary Union as well. They have to fulfil all the so-called Maastricht criteria (on debt, deficit, inflation, interest rates, exchange rate stability), and even the sustainability of those is under assessment \u2013 something that was not in fashion in the late 1990s, when the founding 12 created the zone.</p> <p>It should now be clear that crucifying new members on Maastricht criteria can cause disintegration in what should be the most dynamic part of the union. Because a high proportion of the Hungarian banking system is foreign owned (by Austrian, Italian and German banks), a financial crisis in Hungary cannot be isolated from the rest of the EU. The Maastricht criteria have to be shelved in order to maintain stability not just in Hungary, but in Europe as a whole, where major banks are exposed to serious risks in new member states. In other words, the collapse of emerging economies could trigger, as Susan George put it once, a boomerang effect.</p>",
  "<h2>Nam June Paik - Electronic Superhighway: Continental US, Alaska, Hawaii (1995)</h2> <p>The South-Korean born Nam June Paik was considered to be the first video artist, and developed the idea of an electronic superhighway in 1974. This 49-channel closed-circuit video installation is Paik's retort to America's obsession with television, the moving image and all things bright and shiny. (JL)</p> <h2>Paleolithic art - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/29/paleolithic-art\">read more here</a></h2> <h2>Samuel Palmer - The Sketchbook of 1824, Early Morning (1825)</h2> <p>William Blake's rurally inclined friend, Palmer created some of the most seductive images of the English countryside. The subjects tend towards the predictably idyllic: the sentimentality of fly-free picnics, reclining poets and the dignity of the farmer's lot. Yet Palmer's delineation of infinite natural variety raises the atmosphere to visionary heights. The sketchbook, an extraordinary document of almost unhinged passion for nature, contains surely the most uncanny drawing of a donkey in all art history. Every patterned texture of Early Morning comes across as if swarming with organic energy. (RC)</p> <h2>Parmigianino - Self-Portrait in a Mirror (1524)Madonna of the Long Neck (1534-1539)</h2> <p>To draw his own portrait Parmigianino has looked into a convex mirror, and his painting is a simulacrum of that mirror - a round picture in which we see a distorted room, with the artist's drawing hand huge in the foreground.</p> <p>These kinds of daring surprises are typical of the style called mannerism that developed in Italy as soon as the Renaissance ideals of proportion and perspective had been achieved; distortion, as in Parmigianino's Madonna of the Long Neck, was now the only way now for young artists to go. (JJ)</p> <h2>Martin Parr - New Brighton (1983-1986)</h2> <p>At the time, Martin Parr's series of photographs from New Brighton, a dilapidated seaside spot on the Wirral, were attacked as condescending. But now they look humorously engaged and fond, bringing British working-class nooks and crannies into view, and reminding us how unusual that was (and is) in art photography. (EM)</p> <h2>Vong Phaophanit - Neon Rice Field (1993)</h2> <p>Laos-born Vong Phaophanit was nominated for the Turner prize in 1993, and the work he created for the exhibition, Neon Rice Field, consisted of undulating lines of rice lit from beneath, emitting a seductive glow. Phaophanit's installations meditate on the transience of life, memory and loss. (JL)</p> <h2>Pheidias (and workshop?) - Parthenon frieze (c440BC-435BC)</h2> <p>A masterpiece of fluid, beautifully composed sculpture, the \"Elgin marbles\" ran in a 160m ribbon around the Parthenon. The frieze depicts a procession with horses and sacrificial animals culminating in a rather opaque religious ritual.</p> <p>Though it is one of the most celebrated artworks in the world, the first guidebook to Greece, written in the second century, didn't even mention it. (CH)</p> <h2>Philippines (19th century - Angular wooden figure from northern Luzon </h2> <p>This little black wooden figure, depicted clasping its knees, was once part of a collection owned by the French surrealists Andr\u00e9 Breton and Paul Eluard. The mystery as to the precise origin of it remains, yet it is believed to be from the Ifugao people, who lived in the northern highlands of the Philippines. (JL)</p> <h2>Pablo Picasso - Absinthe Drinker (1901), Portrait of Gertrude Stein (1906), Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), Brick Factory at Tortosa (1909), Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1910), Woman with a Guitar, (Ma Jolie) (1911-1912), Guitar (1912), Three Musicians (1921), Seated Harlequin (1923), Three Dancers (1925), Young Woman in Front of a Mirror (1932), Vollard Suite (1933), Guernica (1937), Weeping Woman (1937), Self-Portrait (1972)</h2> <p>The only reason to deny the title of the greatest artist who ever lived to Pablo Picasso would be a feeling, deep down, that he is less emotionally profound than, say, a Rembrandt or a Goya. And this suspicion would arise from the very thing that makes him so dazzling - his formal inventiveness. Picasso created entirely new visual languages, abandoned them, invented new ones, returned to his previous ideas in new ways, in a flow of creative ecstasy that only faltered late in his long life - and even when the stream mellowed it was still his.</p> <p>There is a joy in life in Picasso's art that defies both the melancholy of his Spanish heritage and the sophistication of his adopted Paris. Perhaps the best place to begin, for anyone who wants to look at Picasso afresh and get the measure of his extraordinary talent, is to look at his series of etchings created in the 1930s for the legendary art dealer Ambroise Vollard: the bold, clear line in which Picasso can draw is as perfect as Raphael's but he does not rest on that perfection - not for a second. He invades it with a stormburst of violent forms: bulls gore horses in the arena, monsters appear to young girls, lovers crush one another as the god of styles plays at will with cubism, surrealism, classicism.</p> <p>By the time Picasso etched the Vollard Suite he could draw on vast experiences and achievements. Recognised as a genius in childhood (here was not an artist who had to wait for recognition) he chose the tough life of the avant-garde, in Barcelona and Montmartre, living in poverty, painting his Blue Period laments - the first, brilliantly sentimental evidence of the social and political compassion that accompanies his creative urge. With Georges Braque, he embarked on his experiment in cubism, the total dismantling of western art's pictorial tradition: his cubist paintings demonstrate that experience is infinitely stranger and more complex than anything that can be simplified into a neatly organised picture. From now on, no visual appearance is taken for granted by Picasso. Everything is pulled apart and remade - he touches things with his eye, and gives them to you to touch as well.</p> <p>No view of Picasso as an artist who rapidly declined or jumped about too much holds up to the testament of his art. The point about Guernica, the great history painting he made in a rage of compassion and solidarity with the Basque town bombed by the German air force during the Spanish civil war, is that it is a natural development from mythological scenes he'd been imagining in the 30s under the influence of surrealism and his own dark side. It is, as a humane statement about war, unmatched in art.</p> <p>This account began by wondering if Picasso might be denied the title of the world's greatest artist because he seems to lack the spirtuality of a Rembrandt, the truth of a Goya. He doesn't have \"soul\", that's true, because he was an atheist. But his late Self-Portrait is no less moving for that. As for truth, as for humanity, as for the full translation of life as he knew it into art - who ever did anything like as much? He matches the genius of High Renaissance masters, yet also lets the brutal savage energy of real life into the studio. The science in cubism outstrips Leonardo's researches. What other artist in history can really compare to the greatest of them all? (JJ)</p> <h2>Giovanni Battista Piranesi - Imaginary Prisons (1750)</h2> <p>Piranesi's etchings pictured Kafkaesque architectural complexes almost two centuries before The Castle and The Trial were written. With an incisive command of suspenseful stage management, Piranesi sets up doors that open onto nightmare precipices and stairways that end in mid-air nowhere. A vertiginous psycho-architecture. (RC)</p> <h2>Antonio Pisanello - St George and the Princess (c1437-8)</h2> <p>The chivalrous dreams of the middle ages are given a reality and substance by new ways of making figures solid and portraits lifelike in Pisanello's art. His St George is an Arthurian knight in a deeply compelling landscape. (JJ)</p> <h2>Nicola and Giovanni Pisano - Pulpits (13th/early 14th century)</h2> <p>The heroic forms that swarm these precocious works of medieval sculpture, inspired by ancient Roman sarcophagi that can still be seen today in Pisa's Campo Santo, anticipate and influenced the Renaissance recovery of the classical nude. (JJ)</p> <h2>Camille Pissarro- The Red Roofs (1877)</h2> <p>The village houses glimpsed through winter trees, their russet rooftops and pale walls tantalising and moving - who lives there? - show how much C\u00e9zanne owed to Pissarro, in whose hands impressionism is a sombre rustic art. (JJ)</p> <h2>Sigmar Polke - Children's Games (1988), Cook Up Art with a Culinary Flair (2002)</h2> <p>Polke went from ironically paying tribute to consumer hotdogs, as a kind of eastern bloc Pop artist, to conjuring some of the most contagiously gripping chemically tinged hallucinations of our time. His Ben-day dots tend to be painstakingly hand-painted. His dream images overlap and cross-associate. The unnerving tension of these two works lies in their thematic ambivalence, hinting simultaneously at things both dreadful and intoxicating, world-weariness and playful innocence. No one else comes near Polke's sophisticated orchestration of unease. (RC)</p> <h2>Jackson Pollock - Guardians of the Secret (1943), The She-Wolf (1943), Full Fathom Five (1947), Alchemy (1947), Number I, 1948 (1948), Autumn Rhythm (1950), Lavender Mist (1950), One: Number 31, 1950 (1950), Blue Poles (1952), The Deep (1953)</h2> <p>The moving thing about the man who \"broke the ice\" for modern art in America is the contrast between his hugely painful, thwarted life and the almost miraculous grace he briefly achieved in his art. What makes this one of art's great and mysterious stories is the clarity with which you can see this heroic tale in Pollock's own paintings, even if you knew nothing of his biography.</p> <p>To look at one of his early paintings like Guardians of the Secret is to see the frustrations of a flawed artist and the unconcealed anguish of a perplexed human being. He imagines \"guardians\", powerful and remote Others, holding up a picture he can't decode, a \"secret\" he dearly wishes admission to - a key to art and life he does not possess. The style of the painting reveals the problems that keep him out of their club: it is manifestly derivative from Picasso.</p> <p>In the 1940s New York was where European modern artists in flight from occupied France found refuge. Pollock was one of a generation of ambitious American painters, schooled in hard knocks by the Depression, who were desperate to emulate them. He was also an alcoholic with serious problems. But in 1943, the year he painted Guardians of the Secret, the collector Peggy Guggenheim started paying him monthly. His wife, the artist Lee Krasner, helped him stop drinking and, working in a converted barn at their refuge of a home on Long Island, he found a way to paint that transfigured the dream art of the surrealists into something new and marvellous.</p> <p>Pollock's version of abstract art is the most exhilarating of the 20th century - more gutsy and alive than the spiritual art of Mondrian, Kandinsky or Malevich - and it gave later artists a lesson in freedom.</p> <p>After this, artists could do anything. What Pollock did was to lay out huge rolls of canvas on the ground and throw, flick, pour and dribble paint on them: like a cowboy throwing out a lassoo, said his champion, the critic Clement Greenberg.</p> <p>Pollock's method was wild - but he was in control of it. \"No chaos, damn it!\" he insisted. In his supreme works - the three cosmic abstractions of 1950 divided today between America's three greatest museums - he attains a harmony in freedom that is simply overwhelmingly beautiful and grand: a vision of an art and a life that might be, an improvised utopia, like a sax solo in paradise. You see something limitless and infinite in this art - and then the door closes. Pollock hit the bottle again. His personality crumbled. His last works are romantic ruins. (JJ)</p> <h2>Pontormo - Deposition (c1526-8), Portrait of a Halberdier (1529)</h2> <p>The fragile coloured forms wafting in the violet air of Pontormo's incredible Deposition are \"bodies\" only in the most perfunctory sense: the people grieving for Christ in their cascade of red and pink and blue draperies that crinkle like cr\u00eape paper in the picture's shallow box are creatures of pure emotion, enfleshed by colour.</p> <p>His young soldier is tenderly portrayed in his idealism and good looks - fodder for the cannon. (JJ)</p> <h2>Nicolas Poussin - Et in Arcadia Ego (late 1630s), Landscape with a Man Killed by Snake (1648), Self-Portrait (1650), Blind Orion Searching for the Rising Sun (1656), A Dance to the Music of Time (date unknown)</h2> <p>Poussin was a great landscape artist, but painting views with topographical accuracy was not the point.</p> <p>These are enchanted environments, depicted with a balance of composition that makes them seem otherworldly. The subjects, too, are not of our time and place, often referring to classical literature, as in Et in Arcadia Ego, in which nymphs and shepherds straight out of Virgil's Eclogues curiously investigate a tomb and come face to face with mortality.</p> <p>Or the utterly strange and bewitching Blind Orion, in which the giant hunter of mythology, having been blinded, seeks the rays of the sun, which will restore his sight. Death, too, interrupts the Landscape with a Man Killed by Snake: in the foreground a python-like creature overcomes a man, and fear seems to fan out from him, affecting the figures towards the background each in turn.</p> <p>Sometimes Poussin is regarded as a \"difficult\" painter, appreciation of whom is supposedly dependent on an encylopedic knowledge of ancient literature, philosophy, and the Bible, not to mention 17th-century French politics. That is to underestimate the pleasure of simply encountering and enjoying the poetry of his subjects and the harmony of his compositions.</p> <p>C\u00e9zanne took inspiration from the disposition of his landscapes.

  "<p>At least we have a number to work with. It is estimated that the banking crisis has resulted in worldwide losses totalling $2.8 trillion. That may seem like an awful lot, but it actually works out at just $418 (approximately \u00a3418 by the time you read this) per human. You could raise that with a swearbox in a matter of months. Of course there will be some folk - remote island dwellers, the under-fours, etc - who maintain that since they played no part in the financial meltdown, they shouldn't have to pay anything. In any group of 6.7 billion people, you're always going to have a few hundred million shirkers. That's not an excuse for the rest of us, however. Cheques payable to the chancellor of the exchequer, please.

  "<p>Special measures are needed to help the true losers from the economic recession - the poorer, white working class - if an anti-migrant backlash is to be avoided, the head of Britain's equality and human rights commission, Trevor Phillips, warned yesterday.</p> <p>He said that historically ethnic minority groups and women were worst hit in an economic slowdown.</p> <p>But it had to be recognised today that in some parts of the country \"the colour of disadvantage isn't black or brown. It is white.\"</p> <p>Phillips called for a programme of positive action to help underachieving white children in schools and higher education, and warned that the best defence against those who resented new migrants was to give them a place in society by helping them to compete for jobs. </p> <p>\"We may need to do so with the sort of special measures we've previously targeted at ethnic minorities. The name of the game is to tackle inequality, not racial special pleading. We will fail to so do at our peril,\" said Phillips.</p> <p>He told a Confederation of British Industry summit on migration that the true losers of this recession were more likely to be part-time workers, most of them women who would suddenly become dispensable, rather than the high-profile bankers and city executives.</p> <p>\"We need to look out for the wife or partner with a young child, whose husband may have lost his job or who fears that he will, or who finds that the bills just don't add up unless he goes back to work.</p> <p>\"When she applies for work, is rejected for job after job in a slack labour market, yet sees a clever young Latvian or Lithuanian with two degrees and three languages doing the job she'd like to do, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out how she'll feel.\"</p> <p>He claimed her resentment would be further fuelled by the sight of her child's nursery class with an overworked teacher confronted by a class of 30 that in total spoke 15 different languages at home.</p> <p>Phillips backed up his claim that the poorer white working class are most likely to be the \"true losers\" of the recession by saying it had to be acknowledged that while two-thirds of children of Chinese heritage and three out of five Indian-heritage children routinely got five good GCSEs, 85% of poorer white boys did not. </p> <p>Similarly, while the Bangladeshi girls who made it to university did brilliantly, there was an underclass of teenage white girls who would not make it into higher education after the birth of their first child, he told the CBI conference.</p> <p>Phillips later told the Guardian that the special measures should include specific education grants, similar to those made available for minority ethnic groups and extra help for white students to get into those universities in Birmingham and London where they were no longer in the majority.</p>",
  "<p>In the name of \"modernisation\", the government has insisted on competitive commissioning, a narrow focus on financial efficiency savings, and investment through the private finance initiative (PFI) that builds up long-term debts. It has shown a strong preference for large, aggregated contracts. In other words, public services have been subject to the same blind faith in market forces as the rest of the economy.</p> <p>The failure of unregulated markets will take a double toll on public services. A recession means fewer taxes to pay the bills. And the market \"rules\" that have been reshaping the public sector now threaten their long-term viability. </p> <p>But crisis brings opportunity. Public services will have to find new ways to create real value. One way is to develop service models that deliver multiple benefits in the short term, and build future resilience. There are plenty of examples that show how this could be done. Here are four:</p> <p>\u2022 Devon county council put out a tender for waste and recycling and awarded the contract to a locally based charity rather than to one of the multinational companies that had put in a bid. Mid-Devon Community Recycling provides voluntary placements and employs people with disabilities. It helps people to come off benefits and find work. This way, it reduces the bills for financial support and for health and social care that would otherwise fall to central and local government.</p> <p>\u2022 In London, Camden council commissioned the Holy Cross Centre Trust to provide a mental health daycare service. The trust works with those who use the service and with local volunteers, actively encouraging them to design and deliver their own activities and programmes, to support each other. This \"co-production\" model has at least two advantages. By treating people as assets rather than as problems, it taps into resources that would otherwise not be available - such as time, energy, wisdom, experience, and the wealth of human relationships - to enhance and safeguard mental wellbeing. By strengthening social networks and giving people more control over their lives, it helps to prevent problems and needs that would otherwise generate demands for services. </p> <p>\u2022 Shaftesbury Young People in London and Bryn Melyn Ltd in Wales are two small providers offering high quality, stable, residential care for young people. Interventions like these are not the cheapest, but they create significant long-term value by, for example, reducing the likelihood of young people using drugs or living on the streets. An analysis of these types of therapeutic, preventative provision by the New Economics Foundation (Nef), if scaled up to the residential care population as a whole, would save the exchequer \u00a3700m. Yet the current focus on market forces is pushing providers like these out of business.</p> <p>\u2022 The NHS trusts in Cornwall work together on sustainable food procurement, with a combined food budget of more than \u00a31.5m a year. They want high-quality food for patients, staff and visitors, and they try to spend the money in Cornwall and the south-west in order to improve the wealth and the social and physical health of the local community - as well as cutting food miles. They have placed business with local suppliers for sandwiches, fruit and vegetables, cheese and ice cream. They aim to source local food and employ local labour, providing meals for all healthcare establishments in Cornwall.</p> <p>These examples have key features in common. They target spending so that public money circulates locally for longer. They help to build local economic resilience, strengthening skills and knowledge at the local level, and creating employment. They seek to maintain wellbeing and thereby safeguard resources for meeting needs that cannot be avoided. They invest in ways of working that are designed to achieve at least two positive outcomes for the price of one.</p> <p>Together, they suggest how public bodies can create real value for people over time, instead of ruthlessly pursuing the shortsighted goals of bigger-is-better and more-for-less. Nef has developed models for procurement and commissioning that support this different approach. These models acknowledge the importance of spending public money in ways that deliver social, environmental and economic benefits, assessing performance according to this \"triple bottom line\". We know how to do it, and we know it can work. Camden council has already announced plans to use the sustainable commissioning model across its Supporting People and social services' contracts, worth in the region of \u00a330m over the next two years. The challenge now is to turn the exception into the rule, moving beyond discredited market solutions to strengthen communities and economies, to build resilience locally, and to promote sustainable wellbeing.</p> <p>\u2022 Josh-Ryan Collins works on sustainable procurement and commissioning at Nef.

  "<p>Red circles sprout like a patch of poppies underground. Even after 25,000 years it's apparent they must have been made by spraying rather than daubing paint; the red ochre pigment has a cloudiness at its edges that gives this away. An archaeologist working in this very cave, Peche Merle in the Cahors region of France, has demonstrated that most likely it was spat from the ancient artist's mouth. But what transfixes you is the shape silhouetted among the dots: the shape of a large human hand. </p> <p>The artist placed that hand against the cold rock deep in Peche Merle and spat paint all around to create a negative impression of palm, wrist and fingers. Other handprints in other caves have fingers missing, perhaps from frostbite, for this is the art of the ice age.</p> <p>Human beings have been evolving for many millions of years. Some activities that can be seen as creative, some objects that have something artful about them, can be recognised at least 1.5m years ago when our ancestors started making \"handaxes\", heavy stone tools hewn with a symmetrical beauty that must have been valued by their creators as well as us. Yet it is with the appearance of Cro-Magnons in ice age Europe about 40,000 years ago that art suddenly becomes a spectacular and unavoidable part of human life. Homo sapiens, evolving in Africa and migrating across the world, makes a sensational appearance as the painting animal.</p> <p>Ice age paintings have survived amazingly well in caves in Spain and France. They were seen by adventurers and accidental tourists over the centuries but never recognised for what they are until modern times. There is something uncanny and overwhelming about the degree to which such ancient images display the capacity for observation, imagination and expression that we admire in great art of more recent millennia.</p> <p>A woolly mammoth looms out of the darkness at Peche Merle; its tangled hair is delineated in free, strong charcoal strokes, its eye lost in its matted locks, with two long tusks hanging down. This is a passionate, immediate, rapid sketch of an animal the artist has watched close up, a portrait of an extinct species we only know today from fossils, frozen Siberian monsters - and cave art. It's not a crude image but an emotional one, an expressive masterpiece. </p> <p>It isn't just animals that appear in cave art. Human figures, often stuck with spears and sometimes with animal heads, resemble images of shape-shifting, suffering shamans in various cultures. There are also the tremendous sculptures nicknamed \"Venuses\" - bulbous female bodies with round heads, reddened by ochre, redolent of fertility rites. In the cave complex at Niaux, beautiful and realistic mud effigies of animals skulk in the depths. This art is still being discovered: in 1994, cavers found the oldest pictures of all, painted 30,000 years ago, in Chauvet cave in the Ard\u00e8che. Who knows what marvels of the ice age still await discovery? </p> <h2>Key works</h2> <p>\u2022 Paintings in Chauvet cave, Ard\u00e8che region, France (c30,000 years old)<br>\u2022 Paintings in Peche Merle cave, Cahors region, France (c25,000 old)<br>\u2022 Venus of Willensdorf, female carved figure (c25,000 years old)<br>\u2022 Paintings in Lascaux cave, Dordogne, France (c13,000 years old)</p>",
  "<p>We are about to enter the twilight zone, that strange black hole in political time and space that appears no more than once every four years. It is known as the period of transition, and it starts a week from today, the time when the United States has not one president but two. One will be the president-elect, the other George Bush, in power for 12 more weeks in which he can do pretty much whatever he likes. Not only will he never again have to face voters, he won't even have to worry about damaging the prospects of his own party and its standard bearer (as if he has not damaged those enough already). From November 5 to January 20, he will exercise the freest, most unaccountable form of power the democratic world has to offer.</p> <p>How Bush might use it is a question that gained new force at the weekend, when US forces crossed the Iraqi border into Syria to kill Abu Ghadiya, a man they said had been funnelling \"foreign fighters\" allied to al-Qaida into Iraq. That American move has touched off a round of intense head-scratching around the world, as foreign ministers and analysts ask each other the time-honoured diplomatic query: what did they mean by that? To which they add the post-Nov 4 question: and what does it tell us about how Bush plans to use his final days in the White House? </p> <p>You can choose from two versions. Call the first the \"no big deal\" theory. It holds that the Sunday raid was no more than standard operational procedure in the war on terror. Sure, it meant violating the sovereignty of an independent nation state, but that's not so new: there was a similar incursion into Pakistan in September. Indeed, there may be more relevant precedents. A former official in the Bush administration confirmed to me yesterday that the US has lunged into Syrian territory several times before: it's just that Damascus chose to keep quiet. In which case, the interesting question is why the Syrians went public this time. </p> <p>In this \"no big deal\" version, Abu Ghadiya was simply too irresistible a high-value target to let slip away. \"They saw something they wanted to hit and they hit it,\" says one European diplomat resignedly. The most extreme version of this shoulder-shrugging account holds that the decision may not even have been taken at the political level, but in the field, by General David Petraeus. Not so implausible, since Bush in effect ceded command of the Iraq war to Petraeus a long while ago. </p> <p>Nonsense, says the other school of thought. It is a massive deal to strike at a sovereign state in this way: in an earlier era, before 2001, we would have called it an act of war. Pakistan is no precedent, because in that case there was a degree of cooperation. Not now. </p> <p>This was a deliberate act, calculated to send a series of messages. First, to the Syrians, reminding them who's boss in the region and strong-arming them to do more to crack down on al-Qaida. </p> <p>Second, to the Europeans who have been moving towards a rapprochement with Damascus. Nicolas Sarkozy may have invited President Assad to Paris and David Miliband may have been hosting the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Muallem, in London this very Monday, 24 hours after the raid - but no matter. Bush gets to remind both these uppity Europeans who's in charge. </p> <p>Third, the president could have been sending a message to his own administration. Perhaps this was a memo to his secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who had dared meet Muallem at the UN just last month in a meeting that apparently she requested. If so, it would fit with the pattern of wildly mixed signals that has emanated from the administration in recent months. Two days before Rice sat down with Muallem, for instance, Bush had used his UN address to denounce Syria as a state sponsor of terror. Might Sunday's raid have been the president's attempt to reassert himself against a senior staff all but denuded of its hawks? Rumsfeld, Bolton and Wolfowitz are long gone; the more emollient Robert Gates is at defence, widely tipped to continue under a President Obama. In these last days, Dick Cheney has only himself for company. </p> <p>However we are meant to read it, the attack on Syria looks a lot like a parting shot from Bush, an end-of-the-movie reminder of what this long and bloody saga has been about. A small operation, causing eight deaths, it nevertheless captures much of the Bush ethos that has ruled the globe these past eight years. It was unilateral; it trampled on state sovereignty; and it relied on force as a first, not last, resort. As a souvenir of the Bush era, it would be hard to top.</p> <p>But it may not be the final act. For we have not yet entered the twilight zone proper. That will come only when polls close next Tuesday. When the transition begins, all kinds of surprises are possible. </p> <p>Spool back 20 years, to the dying days of the Reagan administration. In January 1989, the president officially recognised the PLO as the representatives of the Palestinian people. It was a farewell gift to Reagan's successor, George HW Bush: the old man took the flak so that the new president would not have to. </p> <p>In December 1992, Bush himself proved rather less helpful to his replacement, saddling Bill Clinton with the deployment of US forces in Somalia, an episode whose humiliating conclusion badly hobbled Clinton thereafter. </p> <p>Eight years ago, it was Clinton's turn. He sweated until his final hours in office trying to close a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who seemed then to be just inches apart. The legacy was the Clinton parameters, still regarded as marking the basic contours of any future agreement for Israel-Palestine. </p> <p>So what will emerge from the twilight of George W Bush? Most diplomats are bracing themselves. \"They're not going to sleep,\" says one senior British official. The optimists hope for a repeat of Reagan and Clinton, something that helps Middle East peace. It's true that Rice and Bush have been eager for a breakthrough, if only to have a presidential legacy untainted by Iraq. Perhaps Israel and the Palestinians might initial a provisional document, proof that their labours since Bush's Annapolis summit of 2007 have not been entirely fruitless. </p> <p>But the bad timing that has cursed the Middle East so often has struck once again. Israel is entering an interregnum of its own, following Tzipi Livni's failure to form a coalition. It's hard to believe an interim, caretaker administration could forge a peace deal. </p> <p>That leaves other options. Bush could ape Reagan and decide to speak to Hamas. More likely would be a shift in policy that helps future peacemaking efforts: he might, for instance, declare that any changes to the 1967 borders must be equal, with Palestinians compensated inch for inch for any West Bank land conceded to Israel. Or he could look further afield in the region, contradicting himself and Sunday's raid, by reaching out to Syria. Or, as some hawks fear, he could step up the tentative dialogue with Iran. A symbolic gesture would be to open a US visa section in Tehran. </p> <p>Of course, Bush may be thinking of a parting gift more in keeping with the record of the last eight years. He and Cheney might decide, what the hell, we have one last chance to whack Iran - and let the new guy clear up the mess. Not likely, but possible. For in the twilight zone, anything can happen.<br><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\"><br>freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The prospect of fresh cuts in interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic helped propel Wall Street stocks to a dramatic rebound yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average surging to its second biggest points gain on record.</p> <p>The US blue chip index leapt 889 points to 9065, an increase of more than 10%, although most traders were not convinced that amounted to a turning point in the gloom surrounding global markets.</p> <p>\"Was there enough good news to warrant a 10% rally? No,\" said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &amp; Co in New York. \"It makes just as much sense as yesterday's 200 point drop in 10 minutes.\"</p> <p>Amid signs of bargain-hunting, buyers were encouraged by the prospect of a cut in US interest rates today. There was a smattering of good corporate news as a jump in profits at BP sent oil stocks flying and a possible end to a strike at Boeing sent the aerospace firm's shares up by 14%.</p> <p>In London, the City was braced for a fresh cut in interest rates after two members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee dropped the broadest of hints that they were ready to vote for anti-recessionary measures next week.</p> <p>Tim Besley, who sought costlier borrowing in August and has been the most hawkish member of the monetary policy committee, said he was no longer as concerned about the risks from inflation and the signs were that the economy was likely to weaken further after its 0.5% decline in the three months to September.</p> <p>\"As you will know,\" Besley said in a speech in London, \"there was a time last summer when I judged the upside inflationary risks to be sufficient to warrant an increase in bank rate ... But since then, the sharp fall in commodity prices and the consequently more benign prospects for food and services inflation, as well as the substantial weakening in demand, imply that the upside risks to inflation have diminished significantly.\"</p> <p>Besley added that despite the government's plan to inject capital into Britain's banks, credit conditions would remain tight. \"It is less likely that the rebalancing process for the UK will be as gentle as thought one year ago.\"</p> <p>His remarks came after the Bank's deputy governor for financial stability, Sir John Gieve, said the instability in markets over the past year had \"been the most severe in living memory.\" The \"severity and breadth of the downswing,\" which culminated in the \"seizure of money markets in recent weeks,\" had taken markets, policymakers and commentators by surprise. Besley and Gieve voted for the half-point cut in the bank rate to 4.5% this month, and the City expects at least another half-point reduction when the MPC meets next week. Some analysts believe the poor state of the economy may prompt a full-point cut to 3.5%.</p> <p>Shares in London halted their decline. The FTSE 100 rose almost 2%, while the pound steadied against the dollar at about $1.56. Wall Street's surge lifted markets in Brazil and Mexico.</p> <p>Despite yesterday's breathing space, Alistair Darling will use his Mais lecture at the Cass business school in the City tonight to argue that policymakers will have to adapt their approach. \"Many of the recent events in the banking system would have been unimaginable less than a year ago,\" the chancellor will say. \"Few predicted that each of the five large Wall Street investment banks either merged, sought government help or collapsed.</p> <p>\"Today, governments all over the world are using approaches that had until recently been consigned to policymaking history. But it is natural that the conduct of policy should evolve. Just as markets change, so should policy.\"</p>",

  "<p>Lady Xoc passes the spiked rope through her tongue while her husband Lord Shield Jaguar stands above her holding a flaming torch. It is a ritual conducted between the ruling couple late at night. They are robed, jewelled and feathered, with long faces. The limestone relief carving has a flat surface, so it looks almost like a calligraphic stamp or engraver's plate. It is one of the world's most powerful pieces of pictorial art, and one of the most challenging portraits.</p> <p>This is one of a set of carved limestone lintels from a building in the Maya city of Yaxchilan, on the Usumacinta river on the borders of modern Mexico and Guatemala. It tells a story that carries on in the next lintel. As you might expect after threading a thorn-studded rope through her own tongue, Lady Xoc experiences a vision: she sees an ancestral god appear above her in the mouth of a giant serpent. Meanwhile, Lord Shield Jaguar gets ready to perform his own bloodletting ritual by sticking a stingray's barb into his penis.</p> <p>To look on these pictures carved in the seventh to eighth centuries in the \"classic\" phase of Maya civilisation is to be confronted with a way of life so remote it almost seems like science fiction - and yet these are not just humans, they are artistically accomplished humans. Details like slender fingers, baskets holding ritual tools, stylised flames and pictograms are executed with calm confidence. And because of that, you can visualise the scene in a darkened temple where a wife tortures herself as her husband holds a torch, then hallucinates in her pain and bleeding... It's a shocking encounter with a lost world. Rembrandt portrays people we empathise with. The Yaxchilan lintels portray people who intimidate and perplex us - and yet this art makes us see the deep humanity of their existence.</p> <p>The Maya - a native American people who still live in eastern Mexico and Guatemala - produced a great urban civilisation whose \"classic\" age lasted from about 250 to 900. They used an advanced number system and had a complex calendar. Works of art such as the Yaxchilan Lintels, which depict important royal events with dates and other details inscribed on them, reflect a strong sense of history - they are the equivalent of European works such as the Bayeux Tapestry. The mathematical and architectural achievements of the Maya would just be impersonal facts to wonder at without the humanising and troubling authority of their art.</p> <p>The stylised and enigmatic, yet profoundly lucid, beauty of this art tells us who the Maya were and what they felt, before - in their cyclical view of time - the world was destroyed for a fourth time. </p> <h2>Key works</h2> <p>\u2022 Relief portrait of Stormy Sky carved in stone on Stela 31, Tikal, Guatemala (c250-c600)<br>\u2022 Relief portrait of Curl Nose carved in stone on Stela 4, Tikal, Guatemala (c250-c600)<br>\u2022 Leiden Plate, jadeite image of Maya ruler in triumph (c250- c600), in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiden<br>\u2022 Tomb painting, Rio Azul, Guatemala (c250-c600)<br>\u2022 Red clay and bead image of the god Chaak on a cache vessel, in the Stendahl Collection, LA (c250-c600)<br>\u2022 Portrait of King Bird Jaguar in stucco, Stucture 33, Yaxchilan, Mexico (7th-8th century)<br>\u2022 Stone relief of kings on Altar Q, Copan, western Honduras (7th-8th century)<br>\u2022 Portrait of Cauac Sky on Stela F at Quirigua, Guatemala (7th-8th century)<br>\u2022 Relief carvings on stone lintels from Yaxchilan, Mexico, now in the British Museum (7th-8th century)</p>"
