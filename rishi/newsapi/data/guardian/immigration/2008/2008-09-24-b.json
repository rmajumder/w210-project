  "<p>Karl Friedrich is proud to live in Karl Marx Hof, Vienna's vast monument to municipal socialism. But not as proud as he used to be.</p> <p>\"We had great times here. There were artists and writers all around. Great parties. They're all gone now,\" says the former communist. \"Now half the families in my block are immigrants. They can't speak German. They can't even speak English.\"</p> <p>Built in the 1920s to house the working class of the post-imperial capital, Karl Marx Hof was one of the first social housing schemes in Europe, an expressionist fortress of the left in \"Red Vienna\" and then a battleground in Austria's civil war that pitted the socialists against the neo-fascists in the 1930s.</p> <p>Gottfried, an 80-year-old who has lived here most of his life, remains loyal to the political creed that automatically went with the address.</p> <p>\"I'm a worker. I grew up with the socialists, always voted for them,\" he says, declining to give his surname. \"And I'll be voting for them again on Sunday. How could it be otherwise?\"</p> <p>The problem for Austria's Social Democrats, hoping to win an early general election on Sunday triggered by the collapse of the coalition government of Social and Christian Democrats, is that Gottfried is a member of a dying breed - the core voters of the centre-left.</p> <p>\"Everybody here used to vote socialist. But on Sunday a lot of people here will vote for the [far right] Freedom party,\" says Friedrich, who hopes the centre-left and hard right will form a new taboo-breaking coalition.</p> <p>His hunch is borne out by the opinion polls, which predict a surge in support for the anti-immigrant populists of the extreme right, not least because of the inroads they are making into what used to be the guaranteed support for the Social Democrats.</p> <p>\"The Freedom party is now the most proletarian party in Austria,\" says Anton Pelinka, an Austrian political scientist. \"If you look at Vienna, the Freedom party is doing very well in the working class districts.\"</p> <p>That spells trouble for Austria's Social Democrats (SPO), whose own leader and chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, committed political suicide in June by pandering to the main tabloid newspaper and turning Eurosceptic. The U-turn brought down the government and ended Gusenbauer's career. But the problem is more fundamental.</p> <p>\"Austrian social democracy,\" says Fritz Plasser, a leading analyst, \"is in a deep crisis, over its identity, over its programme, and over its prospects.\"</p> <p>The same might be said about almost anywhere you look in Europe. If Labour is anxious about Gordon Brown and the prospects of electoral meltdown, the picture is similarly grim for the centre-left in Germany, France, Italy and beyond.</p> <p><strong>Demoralisation</strong></p> <p>In eight general elections over the past year in Europe from Poland to Ireland and from Finland to Greece, the centre-left has suffered defeat. Only in Spain and Portugal does the centre-left remain solidly in power. Almost everywhere else the mood among social democrats is one of demoralisation and confusion, with hapless leaders adding to the disarray and incapable of drafting popular policies on salient issues such as immigration or the turmoil resulting from free markets and globalised economics.</p> <p>\"All economics nowadays are borderless, while politics still has national borders,\" says Pelinka. \"National governments can do less and less and national politics are in decline.\"</p> <p>If true, this appears to hurt the left more than the centre-right, which claims it is more in tune with the zeitgeist.</p> <p>\"We've won the ideological battle. The culture and moral relativism that the left spread around from the 1980s, we're leaving it behind,\" the French prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, told a conference of 70 centre-right parties this summer.</p> <p>Fillon's confidence might be misplaced. Since taking power last year he and President Nicolas Sarkozy have sunk to ever lower levels of popularity in France, according to the TNS-Sofres pollsters. But this apparent weakness does not translate into gains for the opposition Socialists, who have lost three presidential elections in a row and are mired in a six-way battle to decide who will become the party leader.</p> <p>What has historically been Europe's biggest and oldest political party, Germany's Social Democrats or SPD, is haemorrhaging support, bogged down in internal fighting and policy confusion, despite coalescing in government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. If the extreme right is eating away at the Social Democrats in Austria, in Germany it is the hard left that is stealing the SPD vote in what might be described as old east Germany's revenge.</p> <p>The new party, called simply the Left, the rump of cold war east German communists joined by west German SPD defectors, is polling at 15%, mainly at the expense of the SPD, which slumped to 20% in the polls this summer under the leadership of Kurt Beck, who has just been ousted in a coup by the right wing of the party. </p> <p>The popular foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will now challenge Merkel for the chancellorship next year. But while he might halt or reverse the SPD's decline, Steinmeier is a civil servant who has never stood for elected office or held senior party political jobs.</p> <p>In Italy the predicament for the mainstream left seems even more dismal as it struggles to present a coherent challenge to the rightwing populist Silvio Berlusconi, who is enjoying high poll ratings despite immigration controversies, the collapse of the national carrier, Alitalia, and the Naples rubbish crisis since being re-elected prime minister in April.</p> <p>\"He who maintains a coalition in Italy governs and Veltroni can't,\" says James Walston, a political scientist at the American University in Rome of the centre-left leader, Walter Veltroni, the former mayor of Rome who heads the new Democratic party. The new movement is crippled by old splits and rivalries between secular and Roman Catholic leftists. </p> <p>As in Austria, the populist parties of the far right, the Northern League and the post-fascist National Alliance, are also attracting traditional leftist voters on issues such as immigration.</p> <p><strong>Populist</strong></p> <p>In Karl Marx Hof, Gottfried is confident that despite the sliding fortunes of the centre-left his Social Democrats will win on Sunday. He may well be right. Under a new populist leader, Werner Faymann, who has the support of the Kronenzeitung bestselling tabloid, the SPO is narrowly ahead in opinion polls at around 30% after promising a spending bonanza, the slashing of VAT on food and the abolition of student fees.</p> <p>But that result would be a historic low for the Social Democrats, five percentage points down on two years ago and seven down on 2002. The real victor looks likely to be the far right, tipped to take a quarter of the vote, 10 points up on two years ago. \"The paradox,\" says Pelinka, \"is that the Social Democrats will get the worst result in their history, and still declare victory.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337908149\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1815620650_gdn-int-080917-cb-Bangladesh-Tiger-04-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Tarak Babu could have seen or heard little in the seconds before he died. His village of Jelepara in the far south-west of Bangladesh is desperately poor and has no electricity, and the young fisherman was walking back with food for his family at about 8.15 in the evening. </p> <p>It was June 20 - monsoon season. Tarak was walking along the high earth embankment that protects Jelepara from the river Chunkuri, and had just passed a small Hindu temple with its gaudy, painted wooden effigies of the tiger god Dakshin Ray. He would not have seen the real tiger that had just swum across the river from the great Sunderbans forest 400 yards away. It hauled itself out of the water and mauled him from behind. No one even heard Tarak cry out. </p> <p>But that was just the start of the drama in Jelepara that night. According to Selina, a young woman who lives only a few hundred yards from the scene of the killing, the beast then dropped down off the embankment, and silently entered Gita Rani's family compound in the village. It tried to take a chicken, but Gita came out when she heard the commotion in the hen house and was promptly killed. </p> <p>The tiger then went into the house where it killed her father-in-law, Aghoire Mandal. \"Word spread fast that a man-eater was in the village,\" said Selina. \"Everyone was very frightened and angry. People came from all around and the tiger ran to another house half a kilometre away. There it killed some goats.\" Many villagers kept their doors shut and prayed that night, as others kept watch. When dawn came, the damage was counted: three people, two goats, and several chickens had been killed and the tiger was still in the village. </p> <p>But rather than call the government forest department, 40 miles away, and hope that they would send a marksman to shoot the tiger, the people of Jelepara set about hunting it. It proved to be a brave but brutal exercise. </p> <p>Now it was the animal's turn to run. First dozens of men tried to corner it, blocking off its escape routes and chasing it away from the village. The tiger was tracked through long grass and rice fields. Finally it leapt on the roof of a house. Film shot on a mobile phone by a villager shows the tiger looking perfectly relaxed. </p> <p>As people gathered for the spectacle of what would surely be a kill - either of animal or of humans - several men then climbed a tree above the house with a rope. Slowly they lowered a noose above the tiger's head and secured the rope to the tree. At a given moment, the villagers then all started shouting and the tiger leapt forward in a desperate attempt to escape. But the noose tightened, and the rope, held by the tree, steadily began to strangle it. </p> <p>Men then came forward and clubbed the beast senseless, but it took the strength of many people to hang it up and finally execute it. \"Everyone was astonished how big it was,\" said Selina. \"It was at least 8ft long.\" </p> <p>If it was a human victory, it was one tinged with great sadness. This man-eater was a Bengal Royal, one of the largest of all tiger species, but this was hardly the magnificent beast of the forest seen on TV nature programmes; it was huge, but it was also old, thin and mangey, and had clearly come to the village half-starving. </p> <p>\"It was responsible for about half a dozen other deaths in recent months. It became a man-eater and every now and then it entered villages to look for prey,\" said Rajesh Chakma, from the forestry department, who arrived later with colleagues and took away the body. </p> <p>The tiger attack and the village's revenge on the animal was not unexpected. The Sunderbans' maze of swamp, islands and mangrove forests lying between India and Bangladesh is one of the very few places left in the world where man is not top of the food chain. It is possibly the most dangerous place on earth. </p> <p>Whereas tiger populations are plunging around the world to the point where there may be only about 6,000 left, in the Sunderbans it is believed that numbers are at least stable. At least 500 are known to live there and this almost inaccessible watery wilderness is now the greatest stronghold of tigers left in the world. </p> <p>But in the past few years man and tiger have been confronting each other more and more in the Sunderbans, and for once, it seems that tigers are getting the upper hand. \"More people are being killed in the forest and more tigers are coming out of the forest into human communities than ever,\" says Mamun Rashid, author of a study of 180 human-tiger confrontations in Bangladesh. </p> <p>The Jalepara tiger was the first trapped and killed by a Bangladeshi community in more than four years, but it followed a pattern, says Rashid. \"If a tiger is found in a village the word spreads quickly. Often the tiger is kept cornered somewhere for a long time while people from the village and places nearby come to see the spectacle. Eventually the people try to kill it by stabbing it with spears, knives, axes and or by throwing rocks. Cornered and injured, the tiger often lashes out at someone.\"</p> <p>Officially, there are about 40 human deaths a year from tigers in the Bangladeshi Sunderbans but this is a major underestimation, he says. \"There is a definite increase in people being killed. On the Bangladeshi side of the Sunderbans, at least 70 people are being killed a year now.\" </p> <p>It is the same story in the smaller, Indian portion of the Sunderbans where there is a national park and an established tiger protection zone. \"In Indian Sunderbans last year there were officially 16 deaths by tigers but the actual number of deaths is certainly much more,\" says Pradip Shukla, director of the Sunderbans biosphere reserve. In the past few months there have been seven deaths, he says. \"Many killings go unrecorded; often villagers don't report attacks in restricted forest areas for fear of being fined or having their fishing permits cancelled.\"</p> <p>While tigers may be killing more, humans are largely responsible for their own deaths, according to Rashid. Up to 5,000 people now to go into the forest regularly for food, he says. \"What i s happening is that human poverty is increasing greatly in the Sunderbans. This is because fish catches are declining, the rivers are silting up and, because of climate change, there is an increased frequency and intensity of cyclones.\"</p> <p>Climate change is a reality in the Sunderbans. Rising sea levels, constant erosion and increasingly salty waters make life in the tangle of islands and mangrove forests harder for animals. Bangladeshi scientists record sea levels in the bay of Bengal rising three millimetres a year, resulting in less fresh water, more floods and erosion. One of the largest islands is predicted to shrink by 15% by 2020. On top of that, new irrigation and hydropower projects have reduced the flow of the Ganges. The net result is less space and prey for the tiger. </p> <p>\"The only way that communities can survive is by going deeper into the forests to collect resources, like honey, fish, shrimps and crabs, and wood for their boats and homes,\" says Rashid. </p> <p>\"They are more vulnerable than they used to be. People now rely far more on the forest for subsistence.</p> <p>\"In the past, people could cross the river and go into the forest without too much danger; now the tiger is attacking people more,\" says Selina. \"In the last five years, 10 people from Jelepara have died in tiger attacks. There are many tiger widows here. Ten years ago perhaps one tiger would cross the river a year. The animal would take a cow or a goat and that would be that. Now we have two or three visits a year.\"</p> <p>Tigers are being forced to come out of the forest more because they have less prey than before, says Rashid. His research suggests that most of the victims were attacked from behind and that nearly 80% died. It also put to rest theories that tigers always eat their victims. In just 7% of the attacks did they fully consume humans. Usually, it seems, they took just a few bites, or, as in Jelepara, just killed and left them.</p> <p>Theories abound as to why Sunderbans tigers are more aggressive than elsewhere. Some wildlife experts say the water in this coastal area is more salty and this puts them in a state of constant discomfort. Others speculate that the only way a tiger can defend its territory in these tidal areas is to physically dominate everything that enters. Another possibility is that these animals have grown used to human flesh due to the weather. Cyclones kill many people each year and human bodies drift into the swampy waters, where tigers scavenge them.</p> <p>Equally possible is that tigers in the remote, largely inaccessible Sunderbans were never subject to the hunting massacres that took place in colonial times on the subcontinent, and so have never developed a fear of humans.</p> <p>Today, the villagers' fears are well-founded. \"One man in Jelepara was so afraid of being killed by a tiger that he moved to India to find work. But he was sent back and had to go to the forest to subsist. He was killed immediately,\" says another man in the village.</p> <p>The hostility between the world's two top predators has been based on equal amounts of fear and respect. Fishermen and honey collectors say prayers and perform rituals to the forest gods before setting out on expeditions. In some areas, people going into the forest wear masks looking like faces on the back of their heads, in the belief that tigers always attack from behind. This is said to have worked for a short time, but it seems that the tigers quickly realised it was a hoax, and the attacks continued. On the Indian side of the Sunderbans, people going into the forests wear stiff pads on their backs to prevent the tigers biting the spine, one of their favourite ways to attack.</p> <p>\"If you want to stop the tiger killing people and want to protect the tiger, then you must reduce poverty in the region,\" says Rashid. \"If you reduce poverty you can increase biodiversity. Development is the best conservation here. Otherwise, the tiger will come again and again to the villages and will kill more people. And people will not stop going to the forest, so the deaths will continue\".</p> <h2>Heading for extinction? <br>The animals under greatest threat from a warming world </h2> <p>Animals and plants have evolved very slowly to live in specific environments, but climate change is happening very fast and leaving them unable to adapt. Those suited to cooler climates must move polewards or uphill when the climate becomes just that little bit warmer. That's easy enough for birds and fish; species that would normally only be found in the Mediterranean or further south are now turning up in British waters as the plankton and insects they feed on move north. But for large animals, which often have restricted space in reserves, the future looks uncertain. </p> <p><strong>Polar bears</strong><br>The polar bear could disappear in the wild unless the pace of global warming slows. It uses sea ice as a floating platform to catch prey, but this is melting at a rate of 9% a decade. Last week, arctic ice fell to its second lowest level ever.</p> <p><strong>Tigers</strong><br>Tigers are threatened by climate change, and not just in the Indian and Bangladeshi Sunderbans, where sea level rises and increased salinity is reducing habitat. In Sarawak, Nepal and elsewhere, the already critically endangered animals are finding fewer animals to prey on, as monsoon patterns change, and as people near their reserves compete more with them for food.</p> <p><strong>Elephants</strong><br>In Africa, elephants face a range of threats including shrinking living space, which brings them more frequently into conflict with people. With less space, they are not able to escape any changes to their natural habitat caused by global warming, including more frequent dry periods. </p> <p><strong>Frogs</strong><br>Frogs and other species depending on freshwater are being hit by a droughts in Australia and elsewhere. Since they rely on water to breed, any reduction or change in rainfall can reduce frog reproduction. In addition, higher temperatures dry out their breeding pools. </p> <p><strong>Orangutans </strong><br>Their last remaining strongholds in the Indonesian rainforests are threatened by oil palm plantations, but also by climate change increasing the duration and frequency of droughts. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday September 26 2008. The photograph of a hanged tiger that appears at the end of the video that accompanies the article above was wrongly credited to John Vidal. The picture was sent to the Guardian anonymously from Bangladesh.<br></p>",
  "<p>Preparing a wicket which, by offering the bowlers plenty of assistance, more or less guarantees a positive result is necessarily a risky business. The first danger, that it is sufficiently substandard to trigger a possible points deduction, Somerset have already avoided.</p> <p>\"It's a really good wicket, in fact it's a pleasure to see a Taunton wicket which isn't 80-20 in favour of the batsman,\" said Peter Walker, the ECB pitch inspector, of a track on which 14 wickets fell over the day. The second danger is that the opposition make better use of it and you lose.</p> <p>For all Justin Langer insisted he was thinking in terms of batting, the Somerset captain must have been disappointed to lose the toss. Had the stumps not been in place, it would have been hard to pick the track out from the rest of the square, and when Lancashire's seamers reduced Somerset to 72 for 5, the title looked to be heading to Trent Bridge by default. </p> <p>Marcus Trescothick, playing in front of a stand newly named in his honour, lasted only three balls before edging Oliver Newby to Stuart Law at second slip, Langer perished to a half-hearted drive at Glen Chapple, and when Ian Blackwell departed it looked unlikely that Somerset would reach three figures. </p> <p>What Lancashire failed to do quickly enough, however, was get rid of Peter Trego. The all-rounder was on 27 when he slashed at an Oliver Newby delivery and edged the ball high to first slip, but Paul Horton failed to hang on. In the following over, Chapple had impassioned appeals for a caught behind and then a leg before turned down, and the reprieved Trego went on to play superbly in reaching 81 before edging a drive off Gary Keedy. </p> <p>By then, with brave support from Steffan Jones and Andy Caddick, Trego had dragged the score past 200 before bowlers Caddick and Charl Willough made substantial inroads of their own. There was a third danger, though. Securing a solitary batting point means their maximum return is 18 points. If Notts, with three bowling points already in the bag, pick up four batting points and go on to draw against Hampshire, they will still have done enough. The cider remains on ice.</p>",
  "<p>In the past two weeks, Glasvegas have sold enough albums to rattle Metallica, apparently. The world's biggest heavy metal band allegedly moved the British release date of their latest effort, fearful that it would be denied the No 1 spot by the Glasgow quartet's debut. And yet, there are limits to their appeal. No one in the Scala audience appears to have adopted frontman James Allan's trademark black-clad, bequiffed look. Indeed, for a band so heavily promoted by NME, there is a marked lack of whey-faced indie kids and a surprising number of casually dressed thirty- and fortysomething gentlemen. </p> <p>The latter may have been drawn here because Glasvegas provoke memories of the 80s alt-rock of their youth. Tonight, their wall of guitar noise and thump-crash drumming sounds impressively vast in a 45-minute set that is too short to drag. And while they are hardly the first band in history to swathe themselves in dry ice and make with the blinding white lights and strobes, the old trick still works. </p> <p>But the crowd reaction suggests it is Allan's lyrics that have touched a nerve. There are plenty of bands who inspire blokes to throw their arms around each other, hoist their pints aloft and shout along, but not many who do it with troubled explorations of the male psyche's frailties. </p> <p>You could argue that Go Square Go's concluding cry of \"here we fucking go\" loses its ambiguity when it is heartily bellowed by a crowd of men: the suspicion that it might be intended to express a certain weariness vanishes. Equally, however, it is a flinty heart that remains unmoved by the sound of the stalls singing along to Daddy's Gone: it's like a cross between chucking-out time at a pub and last post at the men's support group down there. </p> <p>As Daddy's Gone ends and the rest of the band leave, Allan remains, bashing his fist against his chest in the universally recognised gesture for \"I'm moved\". Perhaps his national pride has been stirred by the audience's dedication, which extends not just to knowing the words, but to doing impressions. Music sung in a thick regional accent always poses a conundrum for an audience who want to sing along - do you ape the singer's dialect or translate it into your own? - but the Scala crowd gamely opt to give it the full deep-fried pizza: \"Furrgit yer da,\" they chorus, \"he's goan.\" Alone on the stage, Allan applauds their efforts, then heads to the wings.</p>",
  "<p>The man accused of raping and murdering British teenager Scarlett Keeling was released on bail from an Indian jail yesterday. Samson D'Souza, 29, was arrested in February after the 15-year-old's partially clothed body was discovered on a beach in Goa on the west coast of India.</p> <p>He was accused of raping and killing the girl with an accomplice, Placido Carvalho, an alleged drug dealer who was said to have intoxicated her before the rape.</p> <p>On Monday, a court ruled there was no solid evidence linking D'Souza to the 15-year-old's death. He was asked to surrender his passport and cannot leave the state of Goa without court permission. The court released Carvalho in April.</p> <p>Vikram Varma, the lawyer representing Scarlett's family in Goa, said D'Souza had been released after India's Criminal Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which has taken over the case from the Goan police, had failed to register a charge sheet on the former barman within the stipulated 90-day period. An application from the CBI to cancel the bail will be heard in court on Friday.</p> <p>Despite the setback, Varma was confident the case would be resolved. \"We have full faith in the judiciary and the CBI, which is the nation's top investigative agency,\" he said. </p> <p>But vital evidence could have been lost because of a delay in transferring the case from the Goan police to the CBI, he said. \"A lot of evidence has been tampered with or destroyed which should have been collected or cordoned off immediately following the murder.\" The beach shack where Scarlett was last seen, for example, had been dismantled. Migrant workers at the beachside restaurant and bar, who could have been crucial witnesses, had also dispersed, he added. </p> <p>The case has been dogged by accusations of incompetence since Scarlett's murder. Officers initially said the teenager had accidentally drowned when her body was discovered on Anjuna beach. But her mother, Fiona MacKeown, accused Goan police of a cover-up to protect local tourism; a subsequent autopsy revealed the teenager had been raped and murdered after taking a cocktail of drugs including ecstasy, cocaine and LSD.</p> <p>The 15-year-old had been on a six-month holiday with her family. Her mother was criticised by Indian officials for leaving her daughter in the care of a local tour guide while the family visited another part of the region.</p> <p>A local organisation brought charges of negligence against MacKeown, who is wary of returning to India to give evidence in case she is detained, said Varma. He added that she had been refused permission to be represented by counsel to answer the charges: \"Mrs MacKeown is a single mother. Who will look after her children if she is detained? This is a mother who needs the support of the state and she is not currently getting that.\"</p> <p>Granting D'Souza bail on Monday, the court said the prosecution had not collected any evidence linking him to the teenager's death. \"Other than the accused last seen with Scarlett prior to her death, there is no other material bringing out his role in her rape or death,\" the court order said.</p> <p>A local organisation has been relentlessly pursuing a complaint against MacKeown, charging her with negligence for \"leaving her child in the company of a male person from outside the family\". </p> <p>Even though the high court has yet to give its ruling on the complaint, the Goa government's directorate of women and child development has issued a notice to MacKeown to appear in person to reply to the charges. </p> <p>\"The directorate insists [she] should appear in person, and not through her counsel, which goes against the basic tenets of the law,\" said Varma. \"Under the law, everyone has a right to be represented by a counsel. These actions send wrong signals to Fiona - that if she comes to Goa she may be detained here indefinitely on trumped-up charges. </p> <p>\"This is clearly an attempt by the Goa government to tell Fiona, 'if you come here, we will arrest you'. Unfortunately, a single mother cannot afford to fight the state.\" </p> <p>Varma said a voluntary witness, Mike Mannion, from Britain, had been prevented from leaving the country until the CBI took over the case and agreed to lift the notice issued to Indian immigration authorities to detain him. Mannion managed to leave India only on July 25.</p>",
  "<p>It certainly looks like a huge field of cannabis, and when the crop is harvested a pungent, heady aroma can be sniffed from five miles away. Little wonder that someone rang Crimestoppers and the police came knocking when Henry Braham and Glynis Murray started growing hemp on their north Devon farm.</p> <p>The officers quickly found that the couple were not part of a drugs cartel but were cultivating the hemp for its seeds - which yield a nutty oil being touted as Britain's answer to olive oil. </p> <p>Six thousand bottles of hemp oil are now being produced by Collabear Farm, at Tawstock, Barnstaple, every week. Sales have risen by 100% in the past couple of years, and farmers from East Anglia to Dorset are planting crops of hemp to meet the demand. </p> <p>The oil is proving popular with, among others, athletes, including some of Britain's top cyclists, who are convinced that the polyunsaturated fatty acids in it help them pedal faster. Film stars are trying it out to see if it makes their complexions glow with even greater health, and consumers are claiming that a sprinkle of hemp oil on a salad eases painful joint conditions (no pun intended) such as arthritis. </p> <p>But the crop definitely does not get the user high. \"Unfortunately you'd probably die of asphyxiation before you smoked enough to feel anything,\" said Braham. </p> <p>The production of hemp in Britain has a long and glorious history. Until the industrial revolution it was widely grown to make cloth, rope, paper and lamp oil. Cotton and synthetic materials caused it to fall out of fashion but it has a habit of coming back when times are hard: in the second world war farmers in the US were told to grow hemp to ease shortages of textiles and rope. But cotton, synthetic fabrics and the association with cannabis prompted many farmers to stop growing the crop and its production was prohibited in the US. </p> <p>A recent report commissioned by Defra flags up the crop's \"less useful side\" - as a source of marijuana. The report says: \"This narcotic legacy has, over the last century, been an obstacle to its more widespread production.\" </p> <p>But the report emphasises the environmental benefits: hemp grows quickly and easily, so it does not need to be heavily sprayed with pesticides, and it provides habitats for wildlife. The tough fibre is used in a variety of products, from car door panels, concrete, insulation blocks and resin to teabags and banknotes. The report suggests hemp is an \"attractive crop from an environmental viewpoint\" and adds that there is \"some justification\" for encouraging its wider production. </p> <p>A great advantage is that there is little waste - the residue left after hemp seeds are pressed at Collabear Farm is a valuable foodstuff for farm animals; even the dust created can be used for worm farms. Some environmentalists are looking at using the oil as a green fuel for farm vehicles or cars. And the drugs squad need not worry - the seed grown at Collabear Farm contains less than 0.02% of the narcotic agent tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC.</p> <p>The National Farmers' Union has suggested growers wanting to diversify take a look at hemp production. </p> <p>Braham and Murray originally planted hemp at their farm for its fibre alone but later began to wonder if they could produce oil from the plant's seeds. Health experts have long been aware of the presence of vital fatty acids, particularly Omega 3 and 6, in hemp. But hemp oil tended to be confined to the chemist's shelf, much as olive oil was 25 years ago. </p> <p>For 10 years the Collabear enterprise experimented with varieties of hemp, made mistakes, and was regularly visited by Home Office drugs inspectors and the local constabulary, checking to make sure the plants were not the ones rich in THC. </p> <p>Finally, the pair found a taste they were satisfied with. Now the hemp grown in the fields around Barnstaple and further afield is harvested, pressed in the oil mill and bottled under the label Good Oil. Celebrity chefs such as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Jamie Oliver have cooked with it. Oliver has tried drizzling it on ice cream, while Fearnley-Whittingstall likes it sprinkled on a slice of toast. </p> <p>Supermarkets have seized on the oil and sales were up by 100% in 2007 compared with the year before. French growers are showing an interest, with one farmers' cooperative considering growing hemp to send over to Devon for processing at the farm. </p> <p>European manufacturers of olive oil, sales of which topped the \u00a3100m mark two years ago, are unlikely to be worried just yet about the rising popularity of hemp oil.

  "<p>CCTV images of Jean Charles de Menezes travelling on a bus just minutes before he was shot dead on the London Underground were shown at the inquest into his death today.</p> <p>The footage was captured as the 27-year-old Brazilian travelled to his work as an electrician from his south London home. The grainy pictures \u2013 played to a jury at the long-awaited hearing \u2013 show De Menezes boarding the No 2 bus in Tulse Hill, wearing a blue denim jacket and a black T-shirt on July 22 2005.</p> <p>Several minutes later the cameras captured an undercover surveillance officer, known only as Ivor, sitting a few seats in front of him. </p> <p>Another CCTV camera in Brixton recorded De Menezes getting off the bus before moving among a large crowd of people opposite Brixton tube station, which had been closed. Moments later, images capture him re-boarding the bus and sitting upstairs for the short journey to Stockwell. </p> <p>Other cameras - on the bus, at Stockwell underground station and on the train on which De Menezes was shot - were faulty, the inquest was told. </p> <p>Steve Reynolds, of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), said no footage was recorded for a variety of reasons. Engineers had found excessive vibrations prevented several cameras on the bus recording. And a workman had stepped on a cable at Stockwell station severing the cameras on platform two from the recorder. </p> <p>He added that cameras on the train did not work because the recording unit had been removed as part of the inquiry into the suicide bomb attacks of July 7, a fortnight before. </p> <p>Nicholas Hilliard QC, for the inquest, said: \"It is not a complete picture of film on the bus by any means.\" </p> <p>The inquest into De Menezes' death was focusing on evidence recovered by the IPCC in the wake of the shooting.<br> Investigators painstakingly recreated a minute-by-minute account of the 33 minutes between the moment he left home and when he was shot seven times after being mistaken for a suicide bomber.</p> <p>Footage recorded by a surveillance officer known as Frank, hidden in a van near De Menezes's Scotia Road home was shown. It showed six people leaving the modern low-rise block of flats between 7.48am and 8.40am. Frank failed to capture De Menezes on film when he left at 9.33am because he was urinating in a bottle, the inquest was told.<br> A gym card owned by a failed suicide bomber, Hussain Osman, who had been one of four men who attempted an attack on London's underground the day before De Menezes was shot, had led police investigating the botched attacks to Scotia Road.</p> <p>Later, a cousin of De Menezes said the Brazilian had no reason to fear the police. Alex Pereira, 31, said De Menezes had been stopped by police up to four times, including once on a motorcycle in Park Lane. The police were \"very polite\" and De Menezes was not bothered by the encounters. </p> <p>Pereira said: \"We come from Brazil and it is very common for police to stop people there and even police carry a gun in Brazil so it does not scare us,\" he said. \"Why would he be scared of the police?\" </p> <p>A key member of the Justice 4 Jean campaign, Pereira said he and his cousin grew up together in a rural village in south-east Brazil. He said De Menezes was a self-taught electrician who dreamed of travelling to the US or England and went to Sao Paulo when he was 16 so he could earn money on a chicken farm. </p> <p>Periera said: \"He was a guy that liked to learn and he fought to make life better because he came from a place where everything is very difficult. It has become better now but at the time it was very, very hard and since he was a little boy he studied to become an electrician.\" </p> <p>De Menezes travelled to England after he was refused a US visa, he said. Once in the UK he sent money home to support his family and girlfriend, Adriana, who had a child from a previous relationship. </p> <p>Pereira said his cousin thought living abroad \"would bring a better life for everybody\". </p> <p>\"He studied hard and learned English quickly. He was prepared to do any work initially. But he was pleased when he found work as an electrician. He was very ambitious and worked very hard but he still enjoyed life. </p> <p>\"He was very happy in England and I thought he would like to stay here permanently eventually.\" </p> <p>In a statement read to the inquest from another cousin, Patricia da Silva Armani, said news of the shooting left their families devastated. </p> <p>De Menezes had telephoned her to see if she was all right after the failed July 21 bombings. When family members were called to Brixton police station she believed De Menezes had \"done something really bad\". </p> <p>Armani said: \"I thought he was in police custody and I did not realise it was the Stockwell shooting. When police started speaking I could not understand a lot of what was being said. Then I made the connection with the news. My head started spinning and my stomach was turning. </p> <p>\"Later we had to go and see his body in the mortuary. The news had not really sunk in. When I saw his body I fainted.\"</p>",
  "<p>Fashion designers often like to cite highbrow artistic and intellectual inspirations to explain their catwalk creations. Not so Roberto Cavalli, the 72-year-old designer who showcased his spring collection in Milan today. </p> <p>Cavalli has confessed to a much more prosaic motivation behind his work. In a recent interview he claimed that he became a designer simply to have more of a chance with beautiful women. Which - on the evidence of today's catwalk - begs the question: just what kind of woman is Cavalli hoping to meet?</p> <p>The show opened with a selection of white chiffon long-sleeved dresses, buttoned up to the neck - demure in shape but all entirely see-through. Bustles created from multiple frills appeared on the rear of many of the shorter hemmed dresses - imagine a pair of fussy retro tennis knickers and you get the picture. </p> <p>The collection was inspired in part by Brigitte Bardot in the 1965 film 'Viva Maria!', which was set against the backdrop of revolution-torn Mexico in the early 1900s. It is the story of a girl who joins the circus and accidentally invents striptease. The Bardot influence could be seen in the tousled hair and smoky-eyed makeup on the models, but the overall effect was more Little Bo Peep meets St Tropez It girl.</p> <p>Strange as it may seem, there is a huge market for such clothes. The floor-length black party dresses with exposed backs and chiffon panelling, and the flowing geometric print dresses, will score highly amongst the international yacht set that form the Cavalli faithful. </p> <p>Off the catwalk the designer continues to build up his extravagant empire, despite a recent setback when talks to sell a stake in it to a private equity group fell through. With typical exuberance, the designer felt that his label had been undervalued at $1bn - Cavalli felt it was worth twice that amount.</p> <p>With his son Tommaso, the designer has recently launched his own red wine label, the Cavalli Selection. November sees the opening of Cavalli's first club venture in Dubai - an \"entertainment and life concept\" complete with luxury shops and restaurants, to be known as Cavalli Club. No doubt it will become the ideal place to swan around in long, sheer gowns, sipping Cavalli chianti.</p>",
  "<p>In the UK, youth knife crime has received a lot of attention recently. A <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7632386.stm\">high-profile trial</a> in Belgium has refocused public attention here on the issues of senseless violence, law and order, public apathy, immigration and racism.</p> <p>The story, in this case, really does begin with a \"regular Joe\". Joe van Holsbeeck was a popular, friendly and laid-back secondary school student looking forward to a bright future. On April 12 2006, the 17-year-old and his best friend were waiting for a girlfriend in Brussels's busiest transport hub, the Central Station. </p> <p>At around 4.30pm, two teenagers approached them, ostensibly to ask for directions, and then demanded that Joe hand over his MP3 player. When he refused, one of them took out a knife and, amid the rush-hour crowds, stabbed him seven times, including a fatal blow to the heart, according to the court doctor.</p> <p>Adam Giza, the killer, expressed remorse for his deed. \"I am sorry for what happened. I didn't want to kill him. I ask Joe's parents, his brother, and [his best friend] Gil for forgiveness\", the 19-year-old <a href=\"http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF23092008_018&amp;ref=front\">said</a> in his closing testimony before the verdict on Tuesday.</p> <p>That a young man should die for a music player and that it should happen in a busy public place caused public shock and outrage \u2013 not to mention, fear \u2013 at the time. Many people started calling for more policing and tougher punishment for offenders. </p> <p>\"We can't continue to sweep minor offences under the carpet. We need to take a 'zero tolerance' approach\", one resident told De Standaard. \"There aren't enough police agents? There are plenty of unemployed people around. Or why not use the army?\"</p> <p>Guy Verhofstadt, the then prime minister, said that the government must step up its fight against juvenile crime. But others questioned this fixation on policing and wondered how it was possible that Joe was killed in a train station through which some 200,000 commuters pass each day and how his attackers managed to get away.</p> <p>Cardinal Daneels, the country's top Catholic clergyman, condemned what he saw as society's growing apathy and materialism. \"Hundreds witnessed the murder but no one did anything\", the cardinal said in his 2006 Easter sermon. \"God asks us: where is your brother? Where is your Abel? We must not answer like Cain: 'am I my brother's keeper?'\"</p> <p>Glenn Audenaert, a Brussels police chief, echoed the cardinal's message, albeit in less Biblical terms. \"The police cannot be everywhere at once. Safety is a collective responsibility\", he said. </p> <p>While the cardinal and the police chief have a point about public apathy, what they overlook is that, in our modern, well-oiled, mechanical societies, we expect the \"system\" to take care of everything and many people find the potential consequences of intervention highly risky.</p> <p>On a personal level, I find myself far more confident and comfortable about intervening in societies where collective intervention is something of a norm. It is far less threatening for the individuals involved if an entire group of people break up a fight or mediate in a confrontation than if it is left to a lone passerby. If enough people cared, then getting involved would become less a question of heroics and more one of good citizenship.</p> <p>There is another aspect to the case \u2013 right-wing commentators have focused on the apparent ethnicity of the attackers, who were at first described as being of \"north African\" appearance.</p> <p>\"Belgian citizens realise \u2026 that the murder has nothing to do with 'indifference in Belgian society' but everything with a group of north African youths terrorising Brussels\", <a href=\"http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/995\">Paul Belien</a> wrote in the Brussels Journal.</p> <p>But Joe's family refused to have their son's plight used for xenophobic grandstanding. \"Nobody should come to me, asking me to hate all Arabs\", his mother said in an interview with La Derni\u00e8re Heure. \"The youths who killed my son were scum \u2026 scum can be found everywhere.\"</p> <p>Some members of the far-right <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaams_Belang\">Vlaams Belang</a> (VB) even went so far as to suggest that gun ownership laws should be <a href=\"http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/998\">relaxed</a> to allow citizens to \"defend\" themselves. </p> <p>The fact that Joe's attackers turned out to be Polish Roma left the envoys of social intolerance with egg on their face. Needless to say, it wasn't long before some focused on the attackers' \"gypsy\" identity \u2013 and, hence, illegal immigration \u2013 as somehow accounting for the violence. But they are obviously unaware that Giza feared the verdict of his own community, who never allow the re-admittance of rapists and murderers in their midst, over that of the court. </p> <p>Interestingly, a <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/belgian-extremist-gets-life-for-race-murder/2007/10/12/1191696176934.html\">racially-inspired shooting</a> by the nephew of a far-right politician in Antwerp less than a month later caused the VB to plea insanity on the part of a \"lone psychopath\", even though the gunman was deemed to be in full possession of his mental faculties and a jury found him guilty of being a \"racist murderer\".</p> <p>In a symbolic response to the charge of public apathy, 80-90,000 people took part, less than a fortnight after Joe's death, in a \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4936990.stm\">silent march</a>\" in Brussels against senseless violence. It was the biggest public demonstration in Belgium since the \"white march\" against the paedophile and murderer Marc Dutroux. </p> <p>The brainchild of Fouad Ahidar, a Flemish politician of Moroccan descent, the silent march was well-attended by minorities in a clear demonstration that street violence and crime cannot be boiled down to ethnicity.</p>",
  "<p>It was almost inevitable that questions over Portsmouth's ownership arose after their 6-0 drubbing at the hands of Manchester City. Most of us would probably be too embarrassed to own up in the aftermath of such a mauling. Alas there was more than just shame at work when the credentials of Pompey's owner, Alexandre Gaydamak, were called into question this week. </p> <p>No, it has nothing to do with the fact that Alexandre was, according to newspaper reports, prepared to sell the club for \u00a360m. Instead, it emerged that all might not be as it seems at Fratton Park after the Israeli tabloid Yedioth Ahronoth published a list of the assets held by Alexandre's father, the effervescent Israeli-Russian billionaire Arkadi Gaydamak. Portsmouth were listed as one of his, and not his son's, concerns. The club and, of course, the family themselves have vehemently denied the allegations, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/sep/23/premierleague.portsmouth\">the Premier League seems satisfied with their explanation</a>. Yet nothing is ever simple when it comes to the Gaydamaks. </p> <p>That sounds a little melodramatic, so let me explain. This is merely the latest in a long line of controversies to surround Arkadi Gaydamak. To start with there is the widely reported French arrest warrant still outstanding for alleged gun running in Angola and tax evasion. But this is only the beginning of the story, one that could end with Gaydamak Snr being elected to one of the most sensitive political posts in the Middle East.</p> <p>Even in Israel, little has been known about the complicated origins of the Gaydamak millions. When Arkadi burst on to the scene three years ago, purchasing Israel's biggest football team Beitar Jerusalem and bankrolling them to a title almost immediately, few questioned where the money came from. </p> <p>\"It is a bit like in England, we don't know a lot about Sacha [Alexandre's nickname],\" said Shaul Adar, an Israeli journalist based in London. \"Does he have any money of his own? How did he get it? He came into the public domain out of nowhere, like his father. Arkadi met [life-long Beitar fan Ehud] Olmert. He asked to donate money, and the next day he was the owner [of Beitar]. In the few months he was the most famous person in Israel, he was on TV all the time and he came over quite eccentric. He was the Israeli Abramovich.\" </p> <p>Beitar has dominated Israeli football ever since but that wasn't enough. Arkadi had political ambitions, setting up his own Social Justice party and announcing he was to stand in the November 11 Jerusalem mayoral election. His outspoken, maverick persona has more than a touch of the John McCain about it: a right-wing populist that can spring the odd surprise, indulge in some political madness and provoke grudging admiration all at the same time. His purchase of Beitar, who arguably boast one of the most racist terraces in world football, immediately hoisted his flag for the political right. This, after all, was a team whose fans regularly sung songs wishing 'death to the Arabs' whilst refusing to accept an Arab playing for the club. </p> <p>Yet he was also responsible for donating money to the Israeli Arab football team Bnei Sakhnin when they were close to going under after relegation from the Ligat Ha'al. Sakhnin's chairman Mazen Genaim told me that Gaydamak was \"a great man\". It was his money that stopped the team going bankrupt. Indeed, he even tried to sign an Arab player, Abbas Suan, but the Beitar faithful weren't ready and rioted. </p> <p>Last season Gaydamak became increasingly exasperated by his fans' behaviour, first for continually singing racist chants, then for whistling through a minute's silence to mark the assassination of Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, then when a group of Beitar's fans trashed the Israeli FA's offices in Tel Aviv and daubed death threats on its walls, and then, finally, for the two-point penalty that followed a pitch invasion in last season's title decider. </p> <p>\"The idiot bastards can leave,\" Gaydamak said of the hardcore troublemakers at his club. \"The fans that went wild yesterday are bastards, and I have no respect for them. While their numbers are in the thousands, they are not the majority.\" He has even had his own 'Palin moment', stating his desire to appoint an Arab deputy mayor if he is elected, a move that would do more than any other candidate to engage East Jerusalem's reticent Palestinian population.</p> <p>Then there's the philanthropy. Gaydamak has sunk millions of shekels into schemes that have seen him outmanoeuvre established political foes. When the town of Sderot on the Israeli/Gaza border came under a barrage of rocket attacks in the spring of 2007, Olmert, who had by now fallen out with Arkadi, got the mood of the nation totally wrong, insisting that its residents should sit tight and weather the storm. Any evacuation, he reasoned, would be a propaganda gift for Hamas. </p> <p>With graphic pictures showing the residents of Sderot cowering in their basements gripping the Israeli public, Gaydamak had other ideas and rode to the rescue, setting up a luxury tent city in Tel Aviv's Hayarkan Park and laying on buses to evacuate all those who feared for their lives. The camp was staffed with gourmet chefs, tents with Playstation 2s for the kids to play on, and a nightly cabaret. The staff liberally handed out black and gold Beitar scarves. Even earlier this month he paid $13,500 out of his own pocket for the medical treatment of a Palestinian man who had a heart attack during Friday prayers at Al Aqsa Mosque. </p> <p>And then there's the madness. Gaydamak has always been known for his sharp tongue \u2013 he once described Olmert as 'stupid' \u2013 but he outdid himself last month when he declared his opinion on whether the annual Jerusalem Gay Pride march, which has become a pivotal cause for the religious right in the city, would go ahead on his watch. \"They want to be proud? They're allowed to. They want to demonstrate? Fine,\" he stated at a press conference. \"But the streets of Jerusalem are a symbol, and parading on them would be an aggressive act against our tradition, against our values and against our morale. I would lie on the ground in order to block the march and would even die before I approve the pride parade in the city.\"</p> <p>Of course, this can all be explained by political expediency. The ownership of Beitar, or at least being a staunch fan, has been seen in the past as, if not a gateway into politics, then certainly a way of courting a sizeable chunk of Likud-leaning voters for everyone from Netanyahu to Olmert. Aligning the religious right on both sides of Jerusalem is also a clever way of finding common ground between two seemingly paradoxical constituencies: the sanctity of Jerusalem as a religious totem for Jews, Muslims and Christians, where issues like gay pride marches would have both Imams and Rabbis spluttering into their dainty cups of mint tea. </p> <p>Already he has sought counsel from the Mufti of Jerusalem and the Vatican. The desire to give the outgoing prime minister Olmert, one of the most unpopular politicians in Israel's history, a bloody nose and appear to be a safe pair of hands in times of crisis is self-explanatory. Whether this is enough for Gaydamak to persuade a majority of Jerusalemites to vote for him is probably unlikely. Despite currently polling third, and some reports from Israel suggest he may even be looking for a way out rather than face the prospect of finishing last, his camp maintain that their man can spring a surprise by concentrating on his right-wing religious core. The problem is that as the elections near, more unflattering reports emerge. Suddenly the Israeli Abramovich's pockets don't seem so deep anymore. </p> <p>\"When he did his business in Russia and Angola he didn't have to declare how he did it [made his fortune],\" Adar explained. \"But as soon as he bought Israeli companies he had to announce it at the stock exchange. It turns out he is a worse businessman than me! Arkadi is not doing well in the past year.\" </p> <p>Even his formally loyal Beitar fans that used to fill the Teddy Stadium with choruses of 'Arkadi is the Messiah' have started to desert him. This season has so far been a shambles. With two points docked for bad behaviour and the team knocked out of Champions League qualification after an embarrassing 5-0 capitulation to Wislaw Krakow, the side drew 0-0 with arch-rivals Bnei Sakhnin in the opening game of the season. Arkadi responded by sacking not only the manager, but also almost all of the non-playing staff, even the press spokesman. </p> <p>But the turning point was the next game, another 0-0 draw with the equally despised Maccabi Tel Aviv. \"Beitar got a penalty in the 90th minute,\" recalled Adar. \"[Shimon] Gershon took it and missed and on TV you could see him [Arkadi] shouting in Russian 'Why Gershon, why?' And after that he said [in a press conference] 'Why does the coach not get rid of Gershon?' That is when the penny dropped [with Beitar fans] that he is not very good at being in charge of a football club.\"</p> <p>Still, the big prize is the mayoralty of Jerusalem, one of Israel's, if not the Middle East's, most important jobs. It's hard to think of a more divided city, split as it is religiously, culturally and politically. It's a tense place, made tenser by the spate of Palestinian ram raids which seem to have replaced the suicide bomb as the last-resort weapon of choice, where one wrong move can ignite latent hatreds. The mayor has powers over boundaries and building permits, both politically explosive issues for the Palestinians in East Jerusalem who feel they are being slowly 'built out' of their neighbourhoods to skew the demographics in favour of the city's Jewish population. It takes a deft hand, one which many feel he just doesn't have. For evidence, look no further than the goings-on at Beitar this season. </p> <p>\"In three years he has sacked six coaches, fired the entire top-level management team and replaced the third chairman in three years with the club's former goalkeeper Itzik Korenfein,\" explained Jeremy Last, sports editor at the Jerusalem Post. \"His charitable work could be seen as showing that he cares about the Israeli people but it is also an indication of his political attitude. A year ago he admitted in a television documentary on him that he hoped people would support him politically because of the charitable work he has done. The majority of Jerusalemites do not want a mayor who will go on a sacking spree the minute things go wrong. Besides the concerns about his management style, Gaydamak quite clearly has no political experience.\" </p> <p>But the biggest barrier of all may be the fact that Gaydamak will quite literally not be truly able to understand his coveted constituency. \"He barely speaks any Hebrew, a fact which creates a barrier between himself and both his co-workers and his voters,\" Last continued. \"He insists the language barrier is not an issue, but it is hard to imagine how he will be able to sit in city council meetings when he won't be able to understand what is being said.\" November 11 will see whether his philanthropy and wrapping himself in the black and gold of Beitar will pay off. If it doesn't Arkadi will no doubt be looking for a new challenge in pastures new. I hear there's a decent, mid-sized Premier League team for sale on the south coast.

  "<p>These days, picking a holiday can feel like choosing between a rock and a hard place. Long-distance means <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/interactive/2008/sep/12/theairlineindustry.travelleisure4\">hefty fuel surcharges</a>, which means ever more expensive fares. Short haul can spell trouble, too, often involving a showdown with the bullish Euro, or the uncertainty over which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/13/theairlineindustry.travelleisure1\"> airline might collapse next</a>.</p> <p>But hovering somewhere in the middle distance there's a compromise. According to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/sep/21/travelnews.middleeast\">recent research</a>, more and more of us are forgoing the extremes for somewhere in between - leapfrogging the Med and heading to the Middle East and North Africa for winter sun.

With journey times from the UK taking an average of seven hours, flights fall well short of the dreaded nine-hour tax boundary (any flights exceeding nine hours incur fuel surcharges of up to 30% more than those below) and therefore offer very good value for independent bookers and package operators alike. <a href=\"http://www.gambia.co.uk/\">The Gambia Experience</a> has recently <a href=\"http://www.gambia.co.uk/Docs/Special-Offers/Default.aspx\">slashed hundreds of pounds</a> from some of its most popular beach packages, with a variety of seven-night holidays coming in under the \u00a3300 mark.

Over the last few months, their foreign exchange wing has seen sales in Egyptian pounds rocket by over 50%, a development linked to an across-the-board surge in holiday bookings to the country. It's not hard to see why.

In relative isolation further south on the Red Sea Coast, up-and-coming Marsa Alam is what Sharm and Hurgahda were like 10 years ago, and has been witnessing a steady rise in popularity since the arrival of its own international airport in 2001. <a href=\"http://www.regal-diving.co.uk/home/\">Regaldive</a>, as their name suggests, usually occupy themselves with wet suits and air tanks, but when the diving bit is optionally snipped from their packages, the prices drop considerably.

  "<p><strong>10.40am</strong> The start of the relegation battle at Hove between Sussex and Yorkshire has been delayed by rain, <em>writes a disconsolate Lawrence Booth</em>. The groundsmen are mopping up as I whinge and the greyest of the clouds may be heading away, so these could be decent bowling conditions once play gets under way. </p> <p>Chris Adams, in his final game as Sussex captain, has won the toss and has invited Yorkshire to bat. There's no Michael Vaughan (his intercostal niggle has failed to clear up) and no Jonathan Bairstow, who had been touted for a first-class debut behind the stumps. Yorkshire, remember, trail Sussex \u2013 champions in three of the last five seasons \u2013 by four points: the more bad weather, the happier the home side will be.</p> <p><strong>11.05am</strong> Good morning from Taunton, where we look set for a full day's play, but Somerset have already suffered a serious set-back to their championship aspirations, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. Namely, they lost the toss. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, they were put in - the groundsman was clearly instructed to prepare a result wicket, and it's very, very green - and they've already lost Marcus Trescothick and Justin Langer. Trescothick was caught at second slip by Law off Newby's third ball - he was aiming through midwicket, which gives you a fair idea of how much it must have moved - and Langer was caught behind driving without any conviction at all at Glenn Chapple. </p> <p><strong>11.30am</strong> He is here, <em>writes David Hopps at Trent Bridge</em>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/sep/24/countychampionship1stdivisioncricket.hampshire\">Hampshire's cloak-and-dagger operation to bring Imran Tahir back to England</a> for their championship decider against Nottinghamshire was finally revealed when the Pakistani leg-spinner - the inspiration of their season - appeared at Trent Bridge shortly before the start of the opening day.</p> <p>Imran's presence is bound to excite Hampshire into the belief that their championship challenge is still alive. They begin 18 points behind and it would be a tall order to recover that even if the leg-spinner was Shane Warne at the peak of his powers, but their success in persuading Nashau Titans to release Tahir for their final match of the season gives them a glimmer of a chance.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire have won the toss and put Hampshire in. Hampshire's aim must be to make 400, bowl out Nottinghamshire for less than 200, so giving them a chance of forcing a 22-3 victory. As the average first-innings score at Trent Bridge is under 250, that will take some batting effort. </p> <p>They have lost one wicket at the end of the first hour, Mark Ealham having Michael Brown caught behind for 29. They are 46-1 and even though it has not swung prodigiously it will take an innings of substance from somebody. Tahir, meanwhile, will be hoping that he has time for a lengthy nap.</p> <p><strong>11.45am</strong> Good morning from a damp and overcast Canterbury where play got under way 45 minutes late at 11.15am, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. I had a look at the pitch with Jack Birkenshaw, the pitches inspector, and umpires George Sharp and Neil Bainton when the covers came off at about 10.30am. There is some grass there and the general view is that it will do a bit. The Kent players think it's damp. A putting-in pitch, probably, and Durham, with the best pace attack in the land, decided to bowl when they won the toss.<br> The first over, bowled by Steve Harmison, was a torrid affair. Too torrid for Joe Denly. He was beaten by the first two deliveries and caught behind pushing at the third. Geraint Jones came in three.</p> <p>Since then Harmison and Callum Thorp \u2013 especially Thorp - have pitched too short and Jones, like many wicketkeepers, likes nothing better than cutting and pulling. He has raced to 25 and Kent are 31 for one after six overs.</p> <p>Despite the morning rain the forecast for the rest of the match is good. The crowd is poor, especially for a match of this importance, but the sun is fighting to come out now and it will probably fill up after lunch.</p> <p>There are some nerves about in the pavilion here. Kent have been beaten in two cup finals and after being in the running for the championship now face the possibility of relegation. </p> <p>That would be a terrible end to a season which promised much for a good side, one that bats very deep and has some pace in their attack, though Amjad Khan is not playing and has been replaced in the original line-up by Martin Saggers. I'm not certain whether Amjad is injured or simply not been selected at this stage.</p> <p><strong>Midday</strong> Yorkshire managed 26 for the loss of Adam Lyth, bowled by Jason Lewry for a duck, before the rain returned at Hove, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>. Only 45 deliveries have been possible so far, although Sussex \u2013 clinging on to a four-point lead over their relegation rivals \u2013 will be happier to see the weather. Another way of looking at it is that today could be ideal bowling conditions: skittle Yorkshire for under 200 and Sussex really ought to avoid relegation.</p> <p><strong>12.35pm</strong> At lunch here Kent are 81 for two after 19 overs, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. I think they would settle for that after losing the toss and being put in on a pitch that had a hint of dampness about it.</p> <p>Durham will be disappointed by how they bowled. Or they should be. Thorp, in particular, bowled too short. Kent lost their second wicket at 46 in the 11th over when Jones was lbw without playing a stroke. He got a good stride in but umpire Bainton raised his finger for the second time in the match.</p> <p>The wicket-taker was Mark Davies and it was only his second delivery after replacing Harmison.</p> <p><strong>12.50pm</strong> Life is going according to plan for Nottinghamshire, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. Hampshire are 83-4 at lunch - and that aim of reaching 400 to maintain their slim chances of stealing the championship at the last seems a forlorn hope. The way things are going we will be able to rule out Hampshire's championship challenge by tea - before Imran Tahir has even left the pavilion.</p> <p>Chris Read, Notts' captain, was unsure what to do upon winning the toss. \"Bat,\" he said upon observing a dry, cracked pitch. \"Ehm, no bowl,\" he corrected himself as he remembered that Notts have been winning matches by inserting the opposition all season.</p> <p>With Hampshire 46-0, Read might have had a creeping sense of unease. But the second hour of the morning belonged entirely to Nottinghamshire. Mark Ealham had Michael Brown caught at the wicket in his second over, there were two lbw decisions for Andre Adams, bowling around the wicket - Michael Lumb's leave-alone was an exasperating error - and the obdurate Michael Carberry, who had resisted for almost two hours for 23, was dislodged by Charlie Shreck with one that bounced, Read clutching a good catch to his left.</p> <p>Notts lost the Pro40 to Sussex on the last day of the tournament on this ground. There are no suggestions yet that the LV Championship will go the same way.</p> <p><strong>12.50pm</strong> The County Ground is a sombre place at lunch, <em>reports Richard Rae from Taunton</em>. Somerset are 94-5 and look unlikely to pick up a single batting bonus point, after James Hildreth, Zander De Bruyn and, perhaps crucially, the in-form Ian Blackwell followed Messrs Trescothick and Langer back to the pavilion. </p> <p>Hildreth was caught behind, trying to leave a Newby delivery that bounced a little more than he expected, DeBruyn's edged drive at Tom Smith was caught at slip by Paul Horton, and Blackwell got one that stopped on him and gave Smith an easy caught and bowled. </p> <p>The news from Trent Bridge hasn't lifted anybody's spirits either. Huge crowd here, by championship standards - at least a couple of thousand - and while all is far from lost, it doesn't look as though we're going to be here on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> Just how much is a county entitled to mislead the media to improve its chances of winning the championship?, <em>asks David Hopps</em>. Hampshire have spent all week telling everyone who would listen that Imran Tahir was back in South Africa, a story backed up by the Titans coach, Richard Pybus. Tahir himself said as much. Even yesterday, in an interview for his column today for the Southampton Evening Echo, Nic Pothas continued the pretence that Tahir was still in South Africa. Fortunately for him, his ghost was beginning to suspect otherwise.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/sep/24/countychampionship1stdivisioncricket.hampshire\">The Guardian was the only media outlet to get wind yesterday</a> that Tahir was likely to make a shock appearance at Trent Bridge. But even we didn't imagine what now appears to be true: that Tahir never even left England, but has been hiding away all week as part of some huge con-trick.</p> <p>When does a justifiable game of bluff become a barefaced lie? If Notts win by an innings there will be a bit of laughter around Trent Bridge.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong> Tea at Taunton finds Somerset still batting on 188-8, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. Peter Trego, who was dropped by Paul Horton high to his left at first slip off Oliver Newby on 27, is now on 73, and together with Steffen Jones and now Andy Caddick, is guiding Zum towards a batting bonus point. That in itself is something of an irrelevance, but there's beginning to be a feeling Lancashire may have missed their opportunity. The wicket is flattening out - though the odd delivery continues to stop - and if Somerset can get something close to 250, they'll be reasonably happy.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong> It's been an on-off day at Hove, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>, but the Sussex bowlers have taken the chance to keep their collective boot on Yorkshire's throat. When yet more bad light drove the players off at the end of another shortened session, Yorkshire were 57 for three from 24.3 overs and favourites for relegation. </p> <p>In the 17 overs possible after lunch, Andrew Gale was caught behind off Mohammad Sami for 31 as he threw the bat at a short one, before Anthony McGrath's torturous innings of three off 32 balls was ended when he prodded Robin Martin-Jenkins to Ollie Rayner at first slip. Eight points will be enough for Sussex to stay up \u2013 provided those points do not come in a defeat \u2013 but they will not even need as many as that if Yorkshire don't reach 400 (and fail to win). But I'm getting ahead of myself\u2026</p> <p><strong>4pm</strong> Nic Pothas' resistance has just been broken at Trent Bridge, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. He played on to Darren Pattinson for 44, a loose end to an otherwise disciplined innings. His stand with Dimi Mascerenhas was worth 55 and seems to have lasted most of my life. Hants are 151-6.</p> <p>Pothas, you may recall, is the man who told his Evening Echo ghost yesterday that Imran Tahir was in South Africa. It appears that at the time he was actually holed up in one of his flats on Southampton Marina. </p> <p>It seems that Pothas might not be the sharpest card in the pack. If Pothas' ghost had taken him at his word, the column bemoaning the fact that Tahir was in South Africa would have appeared in the Evening Echo around 10.30am this morning - just as Tahir was announced in the Hampshire side for Trent Bridge.</p> <p>Pothas would therefore have lied to make his own column wrong when everybody else knew the truth.</p> <p>'Tis a strange old world.</p> <p>Next week's Nic Pothas column: \"How I scored 400 to win the title for Hants.\"</p> <p><strong>4.15pm</strong> About 3.20pm here this afternoon Durham moved above Somerset and into second place in the county championship, <em>writes Paul Weaver in Canterbury</em>. That was the time when Robbie Joseph's defensive prod was defeated by Callum Thorp and Phil Mustard took a straightforward catch behind the wicket.</p> <p>It was Durham's third bowling point as Kent continued their late burst for relegation by losing their ninth wicket for 180 runs. It has been a miserable batting performance by Kent once again, albeit against some aggressive bowling from Steve Harmison on a pitch that does not look ideal for batting. There is a lot of seam movement.</p> <p>Having said that, why didn't Kent play on one of the pitches down the slope on the left of the square, as you look at it from the pavilion? They are generally flatter there and a draw would suit Kent very nicely. Now they are looking at a defeat.</p> <p>They have come off for a bad light-induced tea at 190-9 and only Rob Key (58) and Darren Stevens (41) have managed to improve on Geraint Jones' 25. This afternoon Kent lost five wickets for 16 runs in eight overs. Martin van Jaarsveld was third out at 81 in the first over after lunch, a leading edge to mid-off. Key and Stevens added 60 for the fourth wicket in 15 overs before the latter padded up to Ben Harmison and was lbw.</p> <p>Key was caught behind, pushing forward, Ryan McLaren, driving, was well caught by the keeper in front of first slip and Justin Kemp was seventh out at 150 when he was lbw to Steve Harmison, working to leg. Yasir Arafat cut Steve Harmison to gully and then Joseph was out. Durham look delighted. Obviously they haven't been following the score at Trent Bridge.</p> <p><strong>5.30pm</strong> That's it from here, <em>writes Paul Weaver at Canterbury</em>. Play has been called off for the day with Kent on 190-9. There has been no play since tea and 44 overs have been lost in the day. At least they haven't lost any ground to Notts. The umpires have been in and out, grimacing at the sky and shaking their heads in despair. But the forecast for the next two days is encouraging.</p>",
  "<p>An ad campaign for website PokerStars.com has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for implying that gambling could make a person more confident and courageous.</p> <p>A PokerStars.com poster campaign ran with the headline \"play mind games\" and featured world poker champion Daniel Negreanu holding an ice hockey stick with the line \"Poker is a sport of courage, conviction and confidence\".</p> <p>Under the advertising code, ads are not allowed to link gambling with sexual success, an improved self-image or appeal to children or young people.</p> <p>The Advertising Standards Authority received a complaint that the reference to courage, conviction and confidence was irresponsible and \"exploited the susceptibilities of children\".</p> <p>Use of the word \"sport\" would also appeal to young people and encourage them to gamble, argued the complainant.</p> <p>The ASA dismissed these complaints, but itself challenged whether the references to \"courage, conviction and confidence\" linked poker to toughness and resilience and implied that gambling could enhance those qualities.</p> <p>In its defence, PokerStars.com said the ad quoted the poker champion's opinion about what was required to be successful and did not imply that a person would acquire those qualities by gambling.</p> <p>It said the reference was meant to draw a distinction between poker, a game of individual skill, and completely chance-based gambling.</p> <p>But the ASA said that \"courage, conviction and confidence\" were attributes that demonstrated mental toughness or resilience, and would be seen as \"admirable qualities by the target audience of 21- to 44-year-old men\".</p> <p>\"We also considered that the claim implied not only that those qualities were needed in order to play poker, but also that success at poker would therefore enhance those qualities,\" the ASA concluded. \"Because of that we concluded that the ad breached the code.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.
