  "<p>Sentiment and nostalgia, I can tell you, is already wafting across the border from the west. Nostalgia as thick as syrup, sentiment swirling around like one of those brumous pea-soupers which would sometimes roll in off Carmarthen Bay of a sudden to threaten kick-off. </p> <p>Stradey Park is coming down. Not before time. The rusted old gates will be padlocked for a final time after the Scarlets' match against Bristol on Friday evening.</p> <p>They asked me to attend the last rites. I'm not one for wakes, certainly not Welsh ones. I'll be content enough to read as much overwrought journalism as I can stomach about crashball bulldozers moving in to flatten the heroic dreams of men in scarlet and the glistening passages they'd contrived for posterity on this ancient ballfield for over a century and a quarter. Not for this corner to join in: the Welsh have quite enough dingy backroom bars and melancholic minstrels to do full panegyric justice to Friday night's reverie around the misty-eyed muse.</p> <p>But a rich heritage, for sure. Of course, as cathedrals go, Stradey is the most unlikely basilica. It's a tip, always has been. Were they patching it up even before they finished building it? Can any shambolic clutter of prefabricated parking-lot ugliness have ever been so cherished, so treasured, as a sacred shrine? For decades, rugby folk the world over have made solemn hymn-singing pilgrimage across the seas to Stradey. Their last train runs this Friday.</p> <p>The ramshackle old site has housed a famous theatre, though. As an outsider, I've been fortunate witness to no end of telling significance at Stradey - the Strad, incidentally, pronounced with a short, sharp \"a\" as in sad or glad.</p> <p>Both glad and sad, I've been Stradey-ing, on and off, for 40 years. Illuminating opening shaft was that foggy-foggy night of opaque murk in January 1967 when 21-year-old mudlark Barry John gleamingly, smilingly, announced himself with the winning try at the very last against seething, slithering Australians who'd been taunted by the boy's close-quartered, drawn-out dancer's paso-doble chass\u00e9. Us Anglos just looked at each other and mouthed \"Wow!\"</p> <p>Most cathartic afternoon of all was in 1983's crisp-bright springtime sun when the Scarlets played to a packed and empathetic house a tribute exhibition match just a few hours after the Cefneithin funeral of possibly Stradey's most fabled son, Carwyn James - and, by fluke, my splintery old pressbox seat had me placed precisely between two of Carwyn's favourite pupils, Gerald Davies and aforesaid genius John.</p> <p>Closure on Friday of a stark and significant history book, all right. Coal, of course, and iron and copper and steel, and in the last 30 years of the 19th century, in a blink almost, valleys were green no more as 300,000 swarmed into south Wales to sweat blood for toil and labour. Llanelli was tin - \"tinopolis\" it called itself and the town's anthem was Sospan Fach (\"the little saucepan\"). The (rugby) football club (est. 1872) played first on People's Park, alongside the town hall. On August 14 1879, the Llanelly [sic] Guardian reported the club's AGM: \"35 present: It was resolved to find a better place for playing. Matter left to captain and secretary.\" A few issues later, September 18, reported: Llanelly FC successful in getting Stradey cricket ground for practices and matches this season. Mr CW Mansel Lewis has consented to become President.\"</p> <p>A coup. Mansel Lewis, \"Squire of Stradey\", was owner of the Mansel Castle Estates. He declared the club colours should be \"royal navy blue\". The newspaper does not say who decreed that 1881's by now new livery of \"rose and primrose stripes\" had changed in 1883 to \"red and chocolate quarters\". But the world and his wife surely knows that on Easter Monday April 14 1884, as the local Guardian reported: \"The home team were first on the ground, making their first public appearance in full scarlet colours with scarlet, gold-laced caps adding much to their bright appearance.\" </p> <p>All of 124 years on, Stradey no more, those Scarlet heirs regroup now across town in the - in comparison, majestically palatial - 15,000-seater Parc Y Scarlets. The muffled drums sound most evocative of all this week, I suppose, for the day of days, October 31 1972, when the bullying All Blacks were out-bullied and the heroic obsequies will be intoned again for Carwyn and Norman, Delme and Derek, Roy and Ray and Andy, Gareth, Benny and all.</p> <p>And we'll try to recall Max Boyce's lyrics and we'll smile again at the memory of that daft and dinky little cricket scoreboard on the tanner-bank which spelled out for immortality LLANELLI 9 SELAND NEWYDD 3.</p> <p>Famous last words, to be sure.</p>",
  "<p>Slanting autumn sunshine would have been appropriate, but as we clambered down from the community bus at Broad Oak orchard, wind and rain knocked us back. We were going to join the seasonal revellers on a weekend given to celebration of local produce - fruit, vegetables, Somerset cheddar, Dorset blue vinny and, of course, cider. The tent flaps ran with water and the going underfoot was soggy, but we were greeted cheerfully and told that the village may not have a pub or a church, but does have a community orchard, half an acre in size, a haven for wildlife, and its grass is rich with wildflowers. The fruit trees vary in age, some, (like the Belle de Boskoop apple tree) are ancient and partially fallen but still fruiting.</p> <p>Broad Oak orchard was given to the Dorset wildlife trust in 1979, and welcomes all comers to pick fruit, relax, or take part in a communal festivity like this weekend's or even the winter wassail that discourages evil spirits from spoiling the crop. </p> <p>Sadly, this past summer's rain has come at the wrong time for the plum crop, and the jam factory was having to lay off staff. But nevertheless the day's event was determined to be cheerful. Folk fiddler and guitarist, crouching under canvas, provided lively accompaniment and contributed to the sense of plenty and goodwill, as Dorset apple cake was liberally dispensed and a man clothed from head to foot in waterproofs crushed apples to demonstrate the cider-maker's art. That same evening, as part of another event (this one under cover and in a school hall) we saw a persuasive film made to demonstrate the merits of local produce: personal dealing between producer and consumer, low food miles and pride in native varieties and regional tradition. Before the film, we savoured rich and varied flavours as we tried a slice carved from a magnificent side of beef, bit into a James Grieve apple, and sipped a glass of Pomona. At the interval there was home-made blackberry and apple ice-cream.</p>",
  "<p>The international financial system is broken. An integrated set of reforms will be needed to achieve sustained economic growth and shared prosperity. The G8 leaders of Europe, Japan and the US have agreed on an emergency summit this autumn in New York to revamp the international system - a good idea, provided it initiates a wide-ranging set of changes rather than being a one-off meeting focused on market regulation.</p> <p>The G8 leaders are keen to start on regulation and that is understandable. Wall Street, the City of London and other financial centres ran wild with undercapitalised borrowing and lending stoked by over-the-top fees and bonuses. Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve fed the financial bubble with rock-bottom interest rates and regulatory forbearance, when it had the chance to restrain it. And the derivatives market was allowed to become so vast and unwieldy that there is no clarity as to who owes what to whom in tens of trillions of dollars of credit default swaps and other derivatives.</p> <p>Risk assessments have been made enterprise by enterprise without consideration of systemic risk. When institutions are \"too big to fail\", they must be closely supervised so that indeed they don't bring the entire system down when they do, from time to time, fail. And we have learned again that there is no global lender of last resort, only a hodgepodge of individual central banks and treasuries, whose individual actions may be sufficient or not to stem a panic.</p> <p>The G8 leaders must go well beyond the issues of financial regulation, however. Even before the current crisis, the global economic system was failing in crucial ways. Many poor countries remain cut off from global prosperity, often falling into poverty-induced violence and conflict. These will be still harder hit by the downturn. The global environmental crisis was also worsening, and climate shocks were wreaking havoc with world food supplies. Energy systems were in turmoil as the growing world economy pushed against supply constraints, yet there was no consensus on how to create an energy system compatible with the environmental and economic needs of the planet. These challenges are in desperate need of attention not only on their own merits, but also because global economic growth cannot be sustained without solutions to these crises. </p> <p>Financial assistance to the poorest countries - a lifeline for more than a billion people - is in tatters. Europe and the US have mobilised around $3 trillion in the past month in guarantees and bail-out funds for the banks but failed to mobilise even one ten-thousandth of that this year to help the world's poorest grow more food in the midst of a massive food-price increase and hunger crisis.</p> <p>The US has been blind to the millennium development goals (MDGs) on fighting poverty, hunger, and disease. When George Bush addressed the UN in September - supposedly the mid-point in achieving the goals - he mentioned \"terror\" 31 times while failing to mention the goals even once. All the big donors except Britain - including the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada - are failing to live up to long-standing aid commitments.</p> <p>The leaders should pause to reflect that there is another little-mentioned international summit scheduled for December in Doha, Qatar, to take up the challenge of financing development. It comes six years after a similar summit in Mexico, at which countries pledged \"concrete efforts\" to achieve 0.7% of GNP in development assistance - a level of aid none of them have yet fulfilled.</p> <p>A true Bretton Woods II summit would set a financial framework to achieve urgent global goals in macroeconomic stability, economic development, environmental sustainability and trade for development. All these are vital for long-term sustainable growth, but global goals in all four areas remain unachieved. Summiteers should come with chequebooks and international commitments in hand.</p> <p>Here, then, is an agenda for Bretton Woods II. First, we need to restructure global finance, based on an expanded system of capital adequacy standards, financial reporting, system-wide risk management, and new lender-of-last-resort capacities. Derivatives traders, hedge funds, and broker dealers would be brought under regulatory control. The IMF would be empowered to be a true global lender of last resort (as I urged a dozen years ago, warning of the threat of self-fulfilling panics). To make this possible, a small tax on financial transactions - a Tobin tax - would be implemented to expand the IMF's war chest in case of crisis and to fund other urgent international needs.</p> <p>Second, the new global financial structure should help to rescue the world from human-induced climate change. A straightforward tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels, levied by all countries, would do the job, and much better than the enormously cumbersome emission-trading system concocted and championed by the same financial engineers who brought us our current banking crisis. Most of the carbon-tax revenues would stay at home in each country, to help finance low-emission technologies. Some would be directed to finance three global public goods: research and development on sustainable energy; transfer of sustainable-energy technology to low-income countries; and climate-change adaptation.</p> <p>Third, the World Bank should be refocused with clear goals, and accountability for their success. Specifically, the bank should have one overarching assignment: helping the poorest countries achieve the millennium development goals to reduce poverty, hunger and disease. The bank is poorly organised for such leadership today. Like any bureaucracy, it avoids being held accountable for measurable results. With a tighter focus on the MDGs, the bank should also be supported with much larger financial resources from new revenue sources (such as the Tobin tax), so that the bank can better help the poorest countries expand vital infrastructure (power, roads, water, sanitation and broadband networks).</p> <p>Fourth, the global trade agenda should be integrated with the finance, and environment objectives. The Doha trade round has failed because the world could not see any urgent reasons for its success. A trade agreement worthy of the effort would do two main things. Importantly, it would help the poorest countries to be more productive so that they can be full participants in the global trading system. \"Aid for trade\" would help these countries to build the skills, roads, bridges and clean power grids to support increased trade. In addition, global trade would promote environmental sustainability, to help enforce compliance with reduced carbon emissions and protection of endangered biodiversity.</p> <p>All these reforms are vital for long-term sustainable growth and development. If the political leaders focus only on financial-sector stability, but neglect the long-term problems of energy supplies, climate change, food production, disease control and extreme poverty, then global growth might be restored in the short term, only to succumb quickly to another global bout of rising energy and food prices, and geopolitical instability.</p> <p>The shortcomings of the existing Bretton Woods institutions, global environmental policies and international trading arrangements have been widely recognised for at least a generation. The current global crisis, and arrival of a new US president in the midst of this unprecedented economic meltdown, may finally mark the moment when the world takes seriously the urgent global economic and environmental agenda that confronts us in this new millennium. A summit in December will be a small step but could be the first meaningful action to steer the world to safety from the dire threats we face.</p> <p>\u2022 Jeffrey Sachs is director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and author of Common Wealth <a href=\"http://www.earth.columbia.edu\">earth.columbia.edu</a></p>",
  "<p>An impressive collection of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/endangeredspecies\">rare big cats</a> including an albino tiger is under Mexican police control after being seized in a raid on the Mexico City mansion of alleged Colombian drug traffickers.

  "<p>Hillary Clinton was scheduled to join Barack Obama on the campaign trail last night for the first time since the two held a rally in New Hampshire in June.</p> <p>The joint appearance in Orlando, Florida, is a fulfilment of her promise to campaign aggressively for him.</p> <p>The rally was part of a two-day blitz in Florida, where the polls opened yesterday for early voting in an effort to avoid congestion and confusion on November 4.</p> <p>Clinton had a campaign stop earlier yesterday in Fort Lauderdale that saw many supporters flee when it began to rain heavily. At his rally in Tampa yesterday, Obama attacked negative campaigning by the Republicans. </p> <p>\"That's what you do when you're out of ideas, out of touch and running out of time,\" said Obama, who is expected at a campaign event in Miami today.</p> <p>Clinton, who turns 61 on Sunday, still harbours hopes of a presidential run, even if Obama was to be a two-term president.</p> <p>According to those close to her, she does not anticipate Obama, if he becomes president, will offer her a job that would appeal. He already has figures in mind for senior cabinet posts such as secretary of state and sensitive posts such as health reform.</p> <p>Having ruled out in a television interview an appointment to the supreme court, Clinton is planning to focus on fighting for health reform from the senate.</p> <p>Her supporters have been slow to warm to Obama and demonstrated their unhappiness at the Democratic convention in August. But she used her convention speech to urge them to rally behind him.</p> <p>According to internal Democratic polls, before the convention only about 30% of her supporters had been planning to back Obama but that has now shifted to 80%.</p> <p>Victory in Florida would almost guarantee Obama the presidency. Although George Bush took the state in 2000 and 2004, Obama has a three-point lead over John McCain, according to RealClearPolitics, which takes the overall average of recent opinion poll figures.</p> <p>The Democratic party reported over the weekend that it had registered 400,000 more Democrats than in 2004, while the Republican party has registered 150,000 more Republicans in comparison.</p> <p>Though Clinton remains bitter about her bruising defeat at the hands of Obama in the primaries, she has been out on the campaign trail for him over the last month. This, however, has gone largely uncovered by the US media.</p> <p>She has been campaigning in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, where she beat him in primaries, mainly because she won over white, working-class voters who have proved resistant to Obama. Her constant refrain on the campaign trail is that he will look out for the working class.</p> <p>Last week she said Obama had closed the deal with the US public and predicted \"a great victory\" for him on November 4.</p> <p>Clinton, who wants to avoid accusations that she did not do enough to secure a Democratic victory, has also put in appearances in recent weeks in swing states such as Michigan, West Virginia New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado.</p>",

The Tories, supporters of an annual limit, are staging a debate on immigration in the Commons today in a bid to pin down whether Woolas is shifting policy. </p> <p>He said: \"We are, in this country, completely screwed up because we are asked the question about the cap without understanding what the question means.\" </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, said: \"We welcome this admission by the minister. But the public will be sceptical that the Government which spent 11 years building up this problem is the right one to solve it.</p> <p>\"So far all we have had in the last few days is an exercise in kite flying - resulting in the minister tying himself up in knots. The public will judge the Government on its actions over 11 years, not its 24-hour spin operation.\"</p> <p>Woolas said the purpose of a points-based system was \"to limit by qualification, hurdle or duration the number of people that come to work here\". </p> <p>He also made the startling admission that people had been right to think governments had not known what was going on over immigration. </p> <p>\"A prerequisite in my opinion is to provide the confidence for society that the authorities, including the government, know what they are doing because, just like in the Netherlands, people did not believe the authorities knew what they were doing. There was a very good reason for that. It is because we didn't - that is the reason. </p> <p>\"If you cannot have border controls that you can count people in and count people out the country ... if you cannot have that proper system, then you cannot carry the confidence of people with you, and if you do not carry the confidence of the people then you cannot tell the immigrant to integrate into society. It is that vicious circle that we have got to break\".</p>",
  "<p>Any attempt to pursue the kind of job creation strategy advocated by Polly Toynbee (Jobs, jobs, jobs must be the mantra for a softer recession, October 18) - also in line with the government's own strategy - is bound to be a repetition of the expensive and wasteful failures of both past and present. There is ample research evidence that the long-term employment benefits of such public investments are negligible and that they can only be justified in terms of the specific public purpose they are designed to serve (eg improved school buildings). As for urban regeneration projects (such as the London Olympics site), international experience shows that the long-term beneficiaries are mainly property developers rather than local residents.</p> <p>In a world where the goal of \"full employment\" is becoming more and more unattainable, policies based on the assumption that everyone should be in a full-time paid job are outdated. Instead we should implement the idea of a citizen's income - set initially at a minimum survival level, say \u00a3110-120 per week - to which all adults would be entitled as of right and which would replace most, if not all, other welfare benefits. </p> <p>This would have the benefit of getting rid of the whole expensive, degrading system of means-testing. It would also have the important merit of sustaining money circulation in the economy, countering the negative impact of rising unemployment and poverty much more effectively than costly, old-fashioned job creation schemes.<br><strong>Harry Shutt</strong><br>Horsham, West Sussex </p> <p>The chancellor is quite right to invoke Keynes and, for that matter, Roosevelt's New Deal as he seeks to direct government spending to create jobs and keep the productive economy afloat (Darling invokes Keynes as he eases spending rules to fight recession, October 20). But suggesting that it is kept afloat by replacing the Trident missile programme is like rebuilding your house from straw as a tsunami gathers on the coast.</p> <p>The moment calls for investment in windmills, not swords. As set out in the Green New Deal, published by the New Economics Foundation earlier this summer, by spending now to build a low-carbon economy, we could generate a vast new carbon army of highly skilled green collar workers, building new energy infrastructure, transport networks and super-efficient buildings. This would join up the need to cope with the impacts of peak oil and climate change, as well as kick-starting the economy. Viewed even in the light of Roosevelt's New Deal, Darling's approach looks short-sighted - Roosevelt's version included the Civilian Conservation Corps, which involved millions of Americans in wilderness preservation, the basis for the emergence of modern environmentalism in the US.</p> <p>A government with vision could use the current crisis to deliver a crucial national plan for a low-energy future and its provision on the ground. <br><strong>Ruth Potts</strong><br>New Economics Foundation</p> <p>The idea that spending \u00a325bn building new Trident nuclear weapon submarines will boost the economy is patently absurd. Despite the huge cost, the employment level is minimal - less than 3,500 at the BAE Systems shipyard in Barrow and smaller numbers elsewhere. Major defence projects suck in vast resources which could be used to stimulate not only a more socially useful form of employment, but a much higher number of jobs and broader economic benefits. <br><strong>Kate Hudson</strong><br>Chair, CND</p> <p>In an economic downturn there is an inevitable rise in unemployment. New minister Phil Woolas immediately plays to the gallery, implying that the job losses are the result of immigration.</p> <p>Two factors seem to have been overlooked. First, a high proportion of the jobs done by migrants are the ones that Brits don't want to take. Second, the systematic selling of British jobs to low-wage countries (eg call centres, Dyson manufacturing) has been going on for years, with no public criticism. The main effect of this is anything but increased efficiency and customer care, but a rapid rise in profits and bonuses.<br><strong>Ike Gibson</strong><br>Ullapool, Ross-shire</p>",
  "<p>The US presidential election will not be free and fair, because millions of electors will either not be allowed to vote or will not have their votes properly counted. It could cost Barack Obama the White House, even if he wins most of the votes on November 4. This sensational claim is based on research by the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html\">New York Times</a> (NYT) and BBC Newsnight. The NYT found that in some states for every new voter registered in the last couple of months, two voters have been removed \u2013 negating Obama's massive voter registration drive. This voter purging could mean fewer people voting next month than voted in 2004. </p> <p>In Colorado, for example, which has seen a significant population increase since the last presidential election, the state has recorded a net loss of nearly 100,000 voters from its rolls since 2004. Louisiana, Michigan and Colorado are deleting registered voters from the rolls within 90 days of a federal election, which is illegal except when voters die, notify the authorities that they have moved out of state, or have been declared unfit to vote.</p> <p>This widespread electoral malpractice is independently corroborated by a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7617204.stm\">Newsnight</a> investigation by <a href=\"http://www.gregpalast.com\">Greg Palast</a>. He reminds us that in the 2004 presidential election, between 1.6 and three million votes were cast but <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/23638322/block_the_vote/2\">never counted</a>, according to the US Election Assistance Commission. This is easily enough votes to have changed the outcome of the poll and put John Kerry in the White House. </p> <p>Palast says that almost three million voters have already been purged from the voter rolls \u2013 mostly poor and black voters who are more likely to vote Democrat. During elections in New Mexico earlier this year, one in nine voters found that their names had disappeared from the voter rolls. In Colorado, the disenfranchisement is even greater, with 20% of voters being purged.</p> <p>It has happened before. During the 2004 presidential election one in four registered Ohio voters turned up at the polling booth only to discover that their names were not on the voter roll, an exclusion rate of 25%. </p> <p>Democrat leaders are too high on their \"Yes we can\" hype to kick up a fuss about this massive disenfranchisement of their voters. They naively assume that Obama's poll lead will give him victory, regardless of the election bias. It might. But then, again, it might not. </p> <p>Another form of voter exclusion is happening in Michigan, where 62,000 lower income families, mostly Democrat supporters, face losing their homes to foreclosure. Loss of residence means losing their voting address and their right to vote. Many of the evictions are being orchestrated by a foreclosure company that supports the Republican party.</p> <p>Michigan isn't alone. In several crucial swing states, including Nevada and Florida, foreclosures and the consequent loss of voting rights could affect the outcome and decide the presidency. </p> <p>Election bias doesn't stop there. The Republican strategist <br><a href=\"http://www.rove.com/election\">Karl Rove</a> has <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2006/10/31/will_a_shocking_new_gop_court\">backed</a> a new law requiring voters to show photo ID at the polling booth. One in ten US citizens don't have photo ID. Among African Americans it is one in five. This requirement will disenfranchise millions of poor, elderly and black Americans, who tend to vote Democrat. In one swing state, Indiana, an estimated 100,000 African-Americans may lose their right to vote. A combination of voter roll purging and photo ID requirement could be enough to swing the presidential election in favour of John McCain \u2013 even if Barack Obama has a substantial opinion poll lead on election day. </p> <p>Writing in Rolling Stone magazine in 2006, the civil rights lawyer Robert Kennedy Jr, JFK's nephew, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen\">revealed</a> how voting irregularities in 2004 were enough to steal the presidency for the Republicans. He has also <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/11717105/robert_f_kennedy_jr__will_the_next_election_be_hacked/1\">demonstrated</a> that the electronic voting machines that will be used in the November 4 election are not reliable and accurate, and that they are vulnerable to hacking. Moreover, he shows that three of the four companies that supply voting machines and count the votes have close links with the Republican party.</p> <p>Writing in the same magazine this month, Kennedy and Palast document large-scale election irregularities by the<br>Republicans that they believe could be enough to swing the election. Their meticulously researched <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/23638322/block_the_vote\">expose</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/videos/player/23654789\">documentary</a> catalogue evidence that the Republicans may have already stolen the 2008 presidential vote.</p> <p>\"If Democrats are to win the 2008 election,\" Kennedy and Palast conclude, \"they must not simply beat John McCain at the polls \u2013 they must beat him by a margin that exceeds the level of GOP [Republican] vote tampering.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton was scheduled to join Barack Obama on the campaign trail tonight for the first time since the two held a rally in New Hampshire in June.</p> <p>The joint appearance in Orlando, Florida, is a fulfilment of her promise to campaign aggressively for him. The rally was part of a two-day blitz in Florida, where the polls opened today for early voting in an effort to avoid congestion and confusion on November 4.</p> <p>Clinton had a campaign stop earlier today in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, that saw many supporters flee when it began to rain heavily. And Obama held a rally today in Tampa and is expected at a campaign event in Miami tomorrow.</p> <p>Clinton, who turns 61 later this week, is still harbouring hopes of a presidential run, even if Obama was to be a two-term president. According to those close to her, she does not anticipate Obama, if he becomes president, will offer her a job that would appeal to her. He already has figures in mind for senior cabinet posts such as secretary of state and sensitive posts such as health reform.</p> <p>Having ruled out in a television interview an appointment to the supreme court, she is planning to focus on fighting for health reform from the Senate.</p> <p>Clinton's supporters have been slow to warm to Obama and demonstrated their unhappiness at the Democratic convention in August. </p> <p>But she used her convention speech to urge them to rally behind him. According to internal Democratic polls, before the convention only about 30% of her supporters had been planning to back Obama but that has now shifted to 80%.</p> <p>Victory in Florida would almost guarantee Obama the presidency. </p> <p>Although President George Bush took the state in 2000 and 2004, Obama has a three-point lead over John McCain, according to Real Clear Politics which averages out recent poll figures.</p> <p>The Democratic party reported over the weekend that it had registered 400,000 more Democrats than in 2004, while the Republicans had registered only 150,000 more.</p> <p>Clinton remains bitter about her bruising defeat at the hands of Obama in the Democratic primary but, largely uncovered by the US media, she has been out on the campaign trail for him over the last month.</p> <p>She has been campaigning in states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, where she beat him in primaries, mainly because she won over white, working-class voters who have been resistant to Obama. Her constant refrain on the campaign trail is that he will look out for the working-class.</p> <p>She said last week that Obama had closed the deal with the American public and predicted \"a great victory\" for him on November 4. </p> <p>Clinton, who wants to avoid accusations that she did not do enough to secure a Democratic victory, has also put in appearances in recent weeks in swing states such as Michigan, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado.</p>",
  "<p>The Home Office is in active talks with trade unions in an attempt to persuade them to abandon opposition to the imminent introduction of compulsory ID cards for airport workers. </p> <p>Meg Hillier, the minister in charge of ID cards and passports, today promised there would be no delays to the \u00a34.7bn programme despite the threat of a UK economic recession. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian ahead of a conference on biometric security checks in London tomorrow, she said many unions privately disapproved of a motion adopted by the TUC last month.</p> <p>The motion, proposed by the airline pilots' union BALPA, calls for industrial and legal action to oppose the requirement from next year that all \"airside\" workers carry an ID card.</p> <p>\"Not all trade unions think that the position is one that should remain,\" Hillier, who is addressing the Biometrics 2008 conference, said. \"They point out the benefits: tackling illegal working, protecting their British members and protecting those working legally from exploitation. I'm talking to individual trade unions.\"</p> <p>ID cards would save employers money by speeding up security checks for airside workers. \"Some are now paying up to \u00a3180 for checks on [potential] members of staff, whereas with ID cards it's all done,\" Ms Hiller said. </p> <p>The first ID cards, for foreign nationals, will be introduced next month followed by those for airport workers in 2009. Young people will be targeted in 2010 and from 2012 everyone applying for a passport will be put on the national identity register.</p> <p>ID cards, which carry the users' fingerprints, will be valid travel documents with the EU and ministers hope that young people will see them as a cheap alternative - at \u00a330 - to purchasing a \u00a372 passport.</p> <p>Ministers met last week to discuss the government's ID strategy, Hillier said. The Home Office's priority is security but other departments are enthusiastic about its potential as a convenient means of proving people's ages and identity in day-to-day transactions.</p> <p>The enrolment procedure can use facial imaging if there is a problem with fingerprints \u2013 for example officials confirmed that some racial groups, particularly those from Polynesian islands in the Pacific, have less pronounced ridges in their fingerprints. Face recognition technology relies chiefly on detecting the distance between people's eyes - a characteristic that cannot be altered even by plastic surgery. </p> <p>The Home Office has been studying work carried out by the US port authorities on reading the fingerprints of dock workers whose fingers have been worn smooth by hard manual labour.</p> <p>Hillier said that trials of automated facial recognition gates at Manchester airport have been successful. The gates match up passengers' to the image of their face in the latest generation of passports.</p> <p>The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), which represents immigration officers in Manchester, has claimed that it is possible to \"tailgate\" - for two people to pass through a scanner when the image of the passenger behind has not been checked.</p> <p>\"There's a number of concerns about the accuracy of the machines,\" a PCS spokesman told the Guardian last week. \"There are people sat there for three hours at a time when they should be doing 20 minute stints. </p> <p>\"It's possible to tailgate. Our concerns that the accuracy will never be right unless you use humans [to check passports] as well.\"</p> <p>The Home Office maintains that \"gates cannot be forced without sounding an alarm. Attempts by two or more persons to move through the barrier system will be detected by sensors and there will always be a supervising border force officer continuously watching the gates and he/she intervenes if necessary.\"</p> <p>Asked about the cost of the government's ID programme, Hillier said the programme was largely self-financing - through the cost of enrolling in the scheme - and no savings would be made by cancelling it.</p>",
  "<p>Some national polls in the last two days have shown the race tightening a little bit, going from six or seven points to five or six points. It bears watching.</p> <p>Four possible explanations:<br>1. The \"he's a socialist\" line is gaining traction. This is the most worrisome explanation, because Obama isn't really answering it. He will have one more chance to do so on a big scale, that 30 minutes of prime-time television he bought on October 29. But two-plus weeks of being called a \"socialist\" isn't a good thing in this country.<br>2. As a result of the third debate, McCain has managed to get some distance from Bush, i.e., with that line about how if Obama wanted to run against Bush he should have run four years ago. CNN's Bill Schneider cites this as the reason.<br>3. Nate Silver, <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/todays-polls-1018.html\">writing on Saturday</a>, said that maybe McCain has gotten more GOP base voters to come back to the fold with more enthusiasm in recent days:<br></p> <blockquote> <p><br>Between \"Joe the Plumber\", \"spread the wealth\", \"I'm not George Bush\", etc., however, McCain at least now seems to have a few somewhat more constructive talking points (in that sense, the fact that the Ayers attacks went over like a lead balloon at the debate might have done him a favor). So some of those crestfallen conservatives might have moved back into the likely voter universe.</p> <p>What I don't know that McCain is doing, on the other hand, is actually persuading very many voters, and particularly not independents or registered Democrats. If that is the case, than McCain is likely to run into something of a wall very soon here, brought about the Republicans' substantial disadvantage in partisan identification. </p> </blockquote> <p>Obviously, this is a comparatively non-worrisome explanation. <br>4. Races just tighten toward the end for reasons we don't know. They almost always do.</p> <p>One thing to remember here I suppose is that we elect presidents by state, so at this point it's really state polls that matter. It's possible that national poll numbers are skewed by more enthusiasm among Republicans in deep-red states. That'll help McCain's national numbers, but if it's actually reflective of increased enthusiasm in Idaho and Oklahoma and Texas and so on, it doesn't matter electorally.</p> <p>I'd say watch the polling especially closely in Virginia, Colorado and a few other states over the next few days. Those are two states Obama needs. If he holds the Kerry states and wins those two, plus Iowa and New Mexico, where he seems to be comfortably ahead, he's won. Actually he wins numerically with either Virginia or Colorado in that scenario, but a little cushion doesn't hurt.<br></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/olympics2012\">London 2012</a> chief, Paul Deighton, today defended the event's \u00a320m-plus sponsorship deal with Cadbury, as the confectionery maker pledged to market its Olympic association to children responsibly.</p> <p>Cadbury was today officially confirmed as a \"tier two\" supporter, a level that costs sponsors between \u00a320m and \u00a340m, to be the sole supplier of chocolate and ice cream at the London 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>In light of the growing UK childhood obesity problem, some have questioned whether Cadbury, which will be permitted to use the London games as part of future marketing campaigns, should be involved in such a high-profile event.</p> <p>However, Deighton, the chief executive of London 2012, defended the move.</p> <p>\"Previous games have had chocolate and confectionery suppliers, and like most sporting events confectionery is available to buy at Olympic games, that is where we started,\" he said.</p> <p>\"[Cadbury] became a tier two deal meaning that [it] is helping to underwrite the staging of the world's biggest sporting events in this country in 2012.\"</p> <p>Cadbury was heavily criticised five years ago for its Get Active! campaign because it encouraged children to eat chocolate to collect vouchers that could be redeemed for sports equipment for schools.</p> <p>Todd Stitzer, the chief executive of Cadbury, said that the company would not introduce any voucher collection schemes or chocolate giveaways in its London 2012 sponsorship.</p> <p>Instead, Cadbury will focus on youth sport and volunteer community engagement with messages based on how a \"treat\" is part of an overall responsible diet.</p> <p>\"It is entirely appropriate that the biggest sports event that Britain has seen is supplied with British confectionery,\" said a spokesman for Cadbury UK. \"It would be odd \u2026 to find only chocolate from foreign companies at the venue.\"</p> <p>He added that the company's ability to reach millions of people every day, through the ubiquitous distribution of its products, provided \"a great way to spread the goodwill and spirit of the games\".</p> <p>Cadbury has a track record of supporting major sporting events, including the Olympics in Sydney in 2000 and the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002 and Melbourne in 2006.</p> <p>Signing Cadbury means that London 2012 organisers have raised \u00a3430m of the \u00a3650m target for sponsorship fundraising from domestic sponsors.</p> <p>London 2012 has signed up seven tier-one domestic partners, paying from \u00a340m each, namely Adidas, British Airways, BP, BT, EDF Energy, Lloyds TSB and Nortel.</p> <p>Cadbury joins Deloitte, the professional services supporter, as a tier-two sponsor.</p> <p>Global partners include McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Samsung.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>\"There is nothing to do here except drinking and fucking. So then \u2026 this is what we do,\" explained an Icelandic ex-girlfriend of one of our managers. On Friday October 17 we flew to Reykjavik's <a href=\"http://www.icelandairwaves.com/\">Iceland Airwaves</a> festival to find out. And play a show, of course. We had been promised both nymphs and nymphets, so we boarded the plane at Heathrow curious as to who, or what, we might find on our travels.<br> Iceland, unlike a lot of Europe, has a soul formed by folklore rather than history. Before coming here, we had been told stories of the nymphs and other mythical creatures that many residents believe live alongside them in underground caves and geysers. During our stay I found there was something magical but disarming about conversing with the blond-bearded locals and smiling Aryan women in broken English and knowing that they could far easier translate ancient Viking texts.  When our plane touched down at Keflav\u00edk in the late afternoon sun, I was overwhelmed by the scenery. This is how Turner would paint Limbo. Ice-blue sea crashing in tempestuous foamed waves against volcanic black rocks. Rough, bleak and romantic terrain stretching as far as the eye could see. A red-and-white checked building with some purpose in the field of aviation reminded me of the Tin-Tin comic Explorers on the Moon.  We entered the outskirts of Reykjavik by coach passing flatpack architecture and an abundance of nothingness. Stunningly beautiful nothingness.  We weren't in the mood to hunt for bands but found one setting up in the corner of an inconspicuous bar. Part of me really hoped they were an Icelandic black metal band. My heart sunk a little when they started playing rhythm and blues. We bought two drinks each at 700 Icelandic krona apiece (about \u00a33.50). According to locals, the price would have been double a few months ago. Our coin felt heavy, which is rare for a Brit in Europe.  White Lies hadn't played a show in two weeks and there was an electric excitement and anticipation binding us together as a gang, like robbers before a heist. The IDNO venue is perfect: a theatre-cum-music-hall situated with chandeliers, panelled walls and a beautifully decorated high ceiling. A spiral staircase led to an upstairs room that we were not meant to find. A stack of demonic looking children's dolls were slumped by an old pram, some almost with their heads off. Slightly unnerved, we left. Our show was fantastic. Being a new and relatively unknown band playing in a city like this, with such a small population, is an experience you don't forget. We earned every drop of sweat and tears in our performance and any icy hearts from curious audience members were thawed after thirty seconds of our opening number. It feels so satisfying to see the first spark inside somebody's eyes, watching a band they weren't sure they would like. On our walk back to the hotel after a perfect night, one of the hundreds of blonde girls heading into town leaned out a window and shouted \"England fuck\". Whatever that meant, it was the first hint of any post-economic xenophobia we had felt. We left her to continue her night of drinking and fucking, while we felt proud to have found much more to do in Iceland than that.  Next stop Toronto.</p>",
  "<p>A top Nato commander today upbraided alliance members for showing a lack of political will in Afghanistan and warned that a lack of progress would undermine Nato's relevance.</p> <p>General John Craddock, a US general and Nato's supreme allied commander in Europe, described the seven-year campaign against an increasingly ruthless Taliban as disjointed. </p> <p>Complaining that Nato is being hamstrung by national considerations, Craddock pointed to more than 70 \"caveats\" that give individual countries a veto over certain operations and the reluctance of countries to meet troop commitments.</p> <p>\"We are demonstrating a political will that is, in my judgment, sometimes wavering,\" Craddock said in a speech to policymakers and defence analysts in London. \"It's this wavering political will that impedes operational progress and brings into question the relevance of the alliance here in the 21st century.\" </p> <p>Afghanistan is Nato's first operation outside Europe, but what started as a mission brimming with confidence is looking increasingly fraught. The 26-member Nato alliance has about 50,000 troops in Afghanistan but commanders say they need at least 12,000 more. Most Nato countries are reluctant to send more troops.</p> <p>Afghanistan is now widely seen as more precarious than Iraq, with the Taliban becoming more sophisticated in its ability to carry out ambushes and bombings. Militants have expanded their traditional bases in the country's south and east - along the border with Pakistan - and have gained territory in the provinces surrounding Kabul, in a worrying development for Nato and Afghan troops.</p> <p>Taliban gains have added urgency to US warnings that the international mission to defeat the Taliban is in peril, and to calls from Nato commanders for a sharp increase in troop numbers.</p> <p>In the latest attack, a suicide bomber in northern Afghanistan killed two German soldiers and five children in Kunduz province, according to Mohammad Omar, the provincial governor. </p> <p>The Taliban have been stepping up attacks in the capital, Kabul, where gunmen this morning killed a British aid worker. The group said that she had been targeted because she was spreading Christianity.</p> <p>Craddock defended the view expressed by Britain's outgoing commander in Afghanistan, Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith, that the Taliban could not be defeated militarily and that at some level insurgents needed to be drawn into a dialogue.</p> <p>\"His comments are generally in line with what our military and political leaders have been saying all along... The conflict in Afghanistan cannot be won by military means alone,\" Craddock, who serves as Nato's operational commander, said.</p> <p>\"We in the international community must come together as part of a truly comprehensive approach (in Afghanistan). The current effort remains disjointed in time and space.\"</p> <p>Craddock was critical of the lack of coordination in aid efforts, whether with non-government or government-backed groups, saying the overall military strategy of \"clear, hold and build\" was often lacking the third component.</p> <p>\"We clear and hold and then we turn around and say 'come on', but the build is inconsistent,\" he said. \"We can't win it, we can only create conditions.\"</p> <p>On Pakistan, Craddock emphasised the need for close cooperation with its security forces and appeared to defend the US policy of pursuing militants across the border into Pakistan, saying self-defence was paramount.<br></p>",
  "<p>Over the past decade, \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/britneyspears\">Britney Spears</a>\" has been one of the most popular web searches, in a wide variety of spellings. And not always in a good way. Britney has certainly been through a period when she has mostly been in the news for reasons other than her singing career. </p> <p>Whether she has recovered remains to be seen, but she is restarting her career with a new single and a series of moves to exploit the internet. These include a new <a href=\"http://www.britneyspears.com\">Britney blog-style website</a>, <a href=\"http://www.circusvip.com/\">a social networking site called Circus VIP</a>, an email newsletter, a <a href=\"http://youtube.com/user/BritneySpears\">Britney Spears YouTube channel</a>, videos and a Twitter feed, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/therealbritney\">therealbritney</a>. </p> <p>Like most pop stars, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/britneyspears\">Britney also has long-running pages on MySpace</a> and Facebook, and her record label, Jive, also maintains a <a href=\"http://www.britney.com/\">fan site</a>.</p> <p>It would be a full-time job keeping all these sites up to date, and Team Britney is doing the work. However, according to Mark Steines of Entertainment Tonight, quoted on BritneySpears.com: \"Britney is taking a hands-on approach with the fun new site \u2013 which she told me is the best way to get past all the tabloid gossip and get the real news straight from the source!\" </p> <p>Well, she's contributed a short \"video blog\".</p> <p>There's a lot at stake, because Britney's hit single, Womanizer, will be followed by an album, Circus, and a tour that includes the UK. There's also a new \"cherry-themed fragrance\", Hidden Fantasy.</p> <p>The blog has many of the elements of a fan site, and early posts include lots of pictures (child photos, red carpet snaps, magazine covers etc), and fan art drawn from Circus VIP. Since it's a blog, it accepts trackbacks and comments, most of which amount to (a) I love you; or (b) please come to Brazil/Mexico/Peru/Portugal/Florida/etc.</p> <p>You can sign up for Circus VIP with an email address and password. This allows you to create your own page with photos and blog posts, start a photo album, upload videos and remixes, import an address book to invite your friends, and add applications. So far there are 58 apps including Gmail chat, speed dating, some simple games and various information feeds. Most seem to have fewer than 10 users, but it's early days. </p> <p>Circus VIP also has groups and discussion forums, where <a href=\"http://www.circusvip.com/profile/LaurenK\">Lauren K, who posts for Britney Spears</a>, says: \"Of course Britney isn't running the site. I was hired by her team to help with her online presence. You can see that I've been transparent about my role as a community manager on the site.\"</p> <p>I assume the same features and applications are available on other social networks built on Ning, the platform used by Circus VIP. Ning was founded by Gina Bianchini and Marc Andreessen, who is better known as one of the founders of Netscape.</p> <p>Anyone can start a social network on Ning, and it's surprising that more pop stars haven't done it. After all, in the entertainment business your fans are your best customers. Getting them involved should pay off.</p>",

  "<p>Time and again, parents tell us what they want for their children is a good local school they do not have to travel far to.</p> <p>We hear stories of families just trying to get the best for their children.</p> <p>Close proximity means children can participate in extra-curricular and social activities, enhancing their experience. </p> <p>Parents also want a school that suits their child's individual needs, be they academic or pastoral, of faith, disability, or gender. There is no 'one size fits all' school; a 'good' school is a school that can meet the needs of the individual child.</p> <p>Here at the Advisory Centre for Education (ACE), we sometimes feel like we're living in a parallel universe. </p> <p>We take in reports on the school admissions and appeals process, but they do not reflect the stories that we hear from parents and carers on our advice lines. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the perpetuation of the myth of choice, and an increasing number of schools with control over their own admissions policy, leads to a more complicated system for parents. </p> <p>Since 2008, school admissions and appeals codes have tried to set up a fairer, more transparent system. The government is trying to satisfy need, but whatever system you have, there will be winners and losers. </p> <p>Those who get the school place they want will think the system works. Those who don't, understandably, blame the system.</p> <p>As part of my role I train local authority and school staff, appeal panel members and clerks. I have sat as a clerk for hundreds of appeals. I am also the mother of two boys, now safely ensconced in secondary school. So I speak as someone who has experienced the admissions process from both ends of the advice line. <br> School admission is not a fiefdom of middle class parents with bright children. </p> <p>It is an issue for looked after children. It impacts on parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities who are desperately trying to find appropriate educational provision. </p> <p>It is a struggle for homeless or refugee families who must negotiate the system on top of all the other adaptations they have to make to family life. </p> <p>Service personnel, recently returned to the country, and looking for housing and schools for their families, are challenged by the process. </p> <h2>What parents should do</h2> <p>Firstly, remember that despite everything that is said about 'choice', you do NOT have a right to choose a school for your child. </p> <p>You do however have a right to state your preference for the school you would like your child to attend, and to give your reasons for this stated preference. </p> <p>If there are more people applying for the school than there are places and if other applicants meet the school's published over-subscription criteria more closely than your child does, your application can be refused.<br> Secondly, make sure that you get all the information you need, both at the time of applying for a school place and, if it comes to it, when appealing. Most importantly, visit schools, if possible while children are attending to see what the learning environment is like. Are all children included? Is there a positive atmosphere? Look at the league tables and Ofsted reports \u2013 but remember that these will not tell you the whole picture. </p> <p>Speak to other parents, children and teachers. Most primary schools will arrange meetings to help parents make their decisions around secondary transfer time. The internet is a mine of information, but always be aware that some information and advice may not be accurate, however well-intentioned it is.<br> Thirdly, think about your child's strengths and any potential problem areas they may have. Look at all the possible schools. Where will their strengths be encouraged and their needs be best met? Next, look at the school's admission arrangements and over-subscription criteria. These must be clear, fair, and objective. They must be published in a booklet produced by the local authority where the school is located and provided to you for free. They are usually also available on the local authority website. See how well your child meets these criteria. If she or he does not meet them well, you may be wasting a preference.  Finally, state your preferences and give all your reasons for wanting the particular schools. Remember to submit your application in time. This is very important as late applications may be considered after on time applications and the school may then already be full. </p> <p>If you have any doubts, speak to your local authority admissions section or for secondary transfer, your primary school. Free help and advice is also available from choice advisers and independent charities, such as ACE.<br> And when you've done all of that, get on with the business of living with and enjoying life with your children. \u2022 Ingrid Sutherland is an education consultant at the <a href=\"http://www.ace-ed.org.uk\">Advisory Centre for Education</a> (ACE)</p>",
  "<p>Puccini's Nessun Dorma provided a suitably emotional climax to yesterday's Teaching Awards ceremony at the London Palladium, an occasion never far from tears.</p> <p>Sung by Fleetwood lad Alfie Boe in honour of Margeret Lund, headteacher of the Lancashire town's Shakespeare primary school, who received a lifetime achievement award, it rounded off this year's crop of inspirational members of the profession. \"A good anthem for teachers \u2013 None Shall Sleep,\" remarked Lund, keeping proceedings on the right side of sentimental. </p> <p>The hour-long show, screened on BBC and presented this year by Jeremy Vine and Myleene Klass, was dreamed up by Lord Puttnam 10 years ago as an antidote to the widespread demoralisation of teachers.</p> <p>\"As a nation we don't show our appreciation nearly enough,\" said Puttnam, who told the award winners: \"You do a serious job all the time and as a nation we sometimes forget that.\"</p> <p>Puttnam steps down this year in favour of Will Wyatt, former BBC deputy director general, and the actor Emma Thompson is to be president of the Teaching Awards.</p> <p>The 142 regional winners were joined by friends, family, colleagues and pupils to see celebrity guests including actors Jeremy Irons and Bill Paterson, Olympic rower and gold medallist Pete Reed, Paralympic swimmer and gold medallist David Roberts, historian Dan Snow, television presenters Adrian Chiles, Sophie Raworth and Zoe Salmon, Doctor Who script writer Russell T Davies, and Dancing on Ice star Suzanne Shaw. </p> <p>Video clips included singer Liz McClarnon and Education Secretary Ed Balls dropping in on two of the 11 UK winners.</p> <p>The Guardian award for secondary teacher of the year went to David Miller of St Ninian's High School in Bishopbriggs, Glasgow. The English, media and film teacher has only been teaching for six years, changing from a career in computing after hearing tales of truancy and domestic abuse while serving on a Children's Panel and deciding he wanted to make a difference.</p> <p>A former roadie for pop band Catatonia, Natalie Richards was named the SSAT outstanding new teacher of the year. A drama teacher at Bishop Gore School in Sketty, Swansea, she was described as a \"fantastic mentor\" to younger teachers and staff.</p> <p>The teaching award for enterprise went to Thomas Minnock of Linton Village College, Cambridgeshire. Under his guidance a group of students made \u00a31.3m on a \u00a3100,000 investment in four months, beating 8,000 other school groups in a national competition.</p> <p>Balls said: \"Everyone can remember someone in their schooling who made a real difference. Teachers are at the heart of their schools and communities and are central in ensuring that young people achieve their potential. It is a vital career which deserves to be recognised at the very highest level.\"</p>",
  "<p>On my left a woman in pink leggings, green top and yellow scarf reached up to hang her facecloth over a beam. It was 1.30pm, the whole boat had just finished eating and we were all swinging gently in our hammocks. I had a view of the jungle and the muddy brown water, while above was a blue sky dotted with cumulus clouds. This was the Amazon, and it was wonderful.</p> <p>Bruce Parry spent nine months <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/amazon/2008/06/to_bruce_and_the_amazon.html\"> travelling along the world's longest river</a> for his latest TV series. But you don't have to be an ex-marine and an expert in indigenous tribes to get close to the Amazon and her people. All you need is a hammock.</p> <p>I bought mine at one of the many tin-shack stores selling them in Tabatinga, a border town in the far west of Amazonas, Brazil. Three countries meet here: Brazil, Peru and Colombia. To get there we'd flown from Bogota, two hours over the rainforest, to Leticia, the Colombian part of Tabatinga. A walk in sapping heat across the porous frontier brought us to the river. Here we found a boat, the Sagrado Coracao de Jesus, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, moored and waiting at the river's muddy edge. </p> <p>Five of these three-deck passenger ferries \u2013 built like old-style Mississippi steamers \u2013 ply the upper section of the river, between Tabatinga and Manaus, the Brazilian Amazonian capital of over a million people. The downstream journey takes three nights and four days \u2013 it takes longer going upstream.</p> <p>The boat was empty, and we were welcomed onboard by the captain's wife who was wielding a broom \u2013 the ship was scrubbed and swept five times a day when we got moving. We would be leaving the next day at 3pm, she told us. In the meantime we could stay on board.</p> <p>That first night, swinging under the stars on deck was quiet. The highlight of the day had been choosing a hammock, and we had nothing to do but share beers with the deckhands and watch them play cards. But by lunchtime the next day, the boat was crowded with people and the card-players were hard at work, loading cargo for the journey to Manaus.</p> <p>This is the beauty of travelling like this along the Amazon \u2013 the people. There are 150 hammocks on each deck, giving each person about three feet of swing space. There is a kitchen and dining room, where passengers eat in shifts \u2013 10 minutes, 30 at a time, at one big table. Fellow travellers are locals, heading to market or using the big ferry to get close to a tributary, where they are picked up by motor canoe, performing audacious mid-river transfers from ferry to river-taxi at full speed before waving and disappearing across the water to some unknown place. You can't see the other side.</p> <p>This is a long, long way from anywhere. The overpowering feeling is one of space. Vast, undiluted space. There is the river, a mile across, though it's hard to tell. Then there is the rainforest, which is always changing, sometimes so dense it looks black, other times flooded, with stark dead trees rising above the canopy. And there are the people. The Amazon river is one vast highway and people live and work along its entire length.</p> <p>Above all this is the sky. A typical day would start perfect, then clouds would build and by 4pm they were set to storm. On day one the rain fell in torrents. Those who knew what to do rolled down blue plastic side-sheeting and then we sat on our hammocks and listened as the rain battered down. Later, storm clouds hung ragged and spent against a yellow sunset, and then it was night. The moon rose. Later, we passed through clouds of flying bugs, which launched themselves at the lights and fell buzzing into T-shirts and hair. The day before we'd drifted through a cloud of blue butterflies.</p> <p>After three days of this restful travelling, we reached Manaus. Along the way we'd seen river dolphins and giant catfish, been waylaid at muddy ports by fruit sellers and fiestas and it felt like we'd never get any closer. We saw the glow of it first, hours before we got there \u2013 a perfect dome of orange light stretched above a dark canopy of trees. We arrived at 10pm and in the hustle of docking only managed to say fleeting goodbyes to new friends \u2013 perhaps as it should be. Manaus by night was charmless compared to the river, and we stayed onboard, choosing hammock over hotel. At dawn we were woken by the metal clang of a big-city port at work. We stepped ashore and found a breakfast of sorts. Then the game of getting out of there began.</p> <h2>Getting there</h2> <p>Boats ply the Amazon all year round. Tickets can be bought locally from the ferry and usually include three meals a day. The journey described cost 150 Brazil reais (\u00a341)</p>",
  "<p>Phil Woolas's controversial call for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/18/immigrationpolicy-immigration\">cap on immigration</a> was heavily influenced by his experience as MP for Oldham and Saddleworth, a constituency which has seen high levels of immigration and was caught up in the 2001 race riots. While it has opened him up to criticism from some in the Labour party for \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/19/immigrationpolicy-labour-phil-wollas\">pandering to the right</a>\" it could help reduce racial tension at time when unemployment is growing \u2013 and in the process help Labour to win back working class voters.</p> <p>As a Labour prospective parliamentary candidate in a seat where the BNP are active I know only too well that immigration is not an easy issue for the party. In January I spoke at a crowded open meeting on the subject in Kenilworth with the former immigration minister <a href=\"http://www.kenilworthlabour.org/#liam\">Liam Byrne</a>. At the event he said why Britain needed to encourage immigration and outlined the Australian points-based system, now in place, which links migrant numbers to skill shortages. </p> <p>Only the subject of immigration would have packed out that hall on a cold, wet Thursday evening and although Byrne got some tough questioning most fair-minded people seemed to accept his argument for why we needed more migrants. However, with the favourable economic situation at the beginning of the year now a distant memory I strongly suspect his successor, <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/phil_woolas/oldham_east_and_saddleworth\">Woolas</a>, would have had a much harder time winning over the audience.</p> <p>Yet Woolas knows better than most politicians what he is talking about when it comes to issues of immigration and community cohesion. He first became involved in student politics as a member of the Anti-Nazi League and entered parliament in 1997 as MP for Oldham and Saddleworth. In 2001 Oldham was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1702799.stm\">torn apart by race riots</a> which saw violent confrontations between white and Asian youths. Although the inquiry blamed deep-rooted segregation which the council had failed to address for generations, Woolas saw at first hand how a combination of poverty and lack of opportunity can cause racial tension <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/10/race.thefarright\"> to boil over into violence</a>. </p> <p>It is this powerful personal experience which Woolas probably had at the back of his mind when he used his first interview as immigration minister to say we must curb numbers of migrants, comments which some in the party saw as extraordinary remarks for a Labour minister. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said: \"I would be astonished at a Labour immigration minister in effect changing the policy. His predecessor and the home secretary have made it very clear they do not support a quota.\" </p> <p>Woolas's call for a cap on immigration is not the first time he has attracted controversy. In 2006 he said that Aishah Azmi, a Muslim teaching assistant, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/minister-calls-for-veilwearing-teaching-assistant-to-be-sacked-420313.html\">should be sacked</a> for wearing an Islamic veil in class. In February of this year he raised the question of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/11/religion.medicalscience\">inter-cousin marriage</a> as a cause of the high incidence of disability within Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. This has given Woolas a reputation for speaking out on thorny issues that many in the party find uncomfortable but has also made him a target for the liberal left.</p> <p>Yet what Woolas critics fail to grasp is the rapidly changing nature of the immigration debate during an economic downturn. His comments reflect the unpalatable truth that immigration and racial tension rise rapidly up the political agenda during a recession as competition for jobs increases. And during hard economic times it is often recent immigrants, who can lack the language skills or experience of the majority, who suffer most. </p> <p>Woolas, who only has a 3,500 majority, also knows that immigration is the one issue where the party has consistently trailed the Conservatives in public support over the last decade. This is particularly true among working class voters who have deserted the party in droves over the last five years and who polling shows strongly support the Tories plans for annual limits on those entering the country. Woolas will hope his change of policy may yet help to win them back.</p> <p>That is why Woolas was right when he said \"If people are being made unemployed, the question of immigration becomes extremely thorny ... It's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it's going to get harder\", whatever some sections of the party may think.</p>",
  "<p>What should we make of the weekend publicity generated by Phil Woolas, Gordon Brown's new immigration minister? Was he finally saying the unsayable, stating the blindingly obvious (his own explanation), or playing fast and loose with inflammatory language on race?</p> <p>Different newspapers, politicians, lobbyists and, of course, voters have come up with different explanations since the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth \u2013 on the Lancashire slopes of the Pennines \u2013 gave his Saturday morning <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4965568.ece \">interview to the Times</a>.</p> <p>Woolas didn't say anything new in policy terms. When appointing him Gordon Brown told him his job was to raise the profile of existing policy; the points system for skilled non-EU nationals, the integrationist initiatives put in place by his predecessor, Liam Byrne, the practical implementation of \"earned citizenship\" such as English-language competence.</p> <p>But overshadowing the interview was the implication that, if the coming recession proves deeper than some estimates predict (<a href=\"http://www.ey.com/global/content.nsf/UK/Media_-_08_10_20_DC_-_ITEM_Club_Autumn_2008_forecast\">Ernst &amp; Young' s Item Club report</a> today, for instance), then it makes no sense to allow more people into the country searching for work and public services which will become scarcer.</p> <p>Woolas himself said: \"I've been brought in to be tougher and to change perceptions,\" by which he means making it harder for people to come into Britain, cutting the link between the right to work and the right to stay \u2013 that one is potentially significant \u2013 but also what he calls \"being kinder\" to those already here.</p> <p>Predictably, he annoyed the likes of Keith Vaz MP by raising the issues at all: only bound to cause trouble with extremists for immigrant communities, the Labour chair of the home affairs select committee said. The Tories were a bit at sea, variously accusing him of dithering, of being unclear and \u2013 several hours later \u2013 of pinching Conservative policies.</p> <p>And the Daily Mail? It cleverly places itself between the irresponsible Guardian-reading lefties who would let anyone in to camp in your back garden and those nasty BNP types; as pioneered by Bill Clinton and adopted by Tony Blair, the technique is called triangulation. </p> <p>Today it declares that says Woolas did a U-turn on Sunday morning's BBC Politics Show and is guilty of \"Woolly Thinking\" in a policy area in which clarity is vital because it is so \"toxic\".</p> <p>What excites the Mail's leader writer, possibly guided by editor, Paul Dacre, is Woolas's suggestion that ministers will not allow the UK population \u2013 now just over 60 million - to reach the 70 million predicted by Eurostat or the 68 million predicted by Frank Field and Nicholas Soames, two interesting MPs stranded on the political beach by circumstances and their own shortcomings. </p> <p>On radio Vaz facetiously argued that it would be hard to police the nation's bedrooms. What Woolas really means is that net immigration is still too high \u2013 600,000 people entered Britain last year, 200,000 more than left, on the last figures I recall reading. One baby in four is born to immigrant mothers on some counts.</p> <p>With variations, some significant, the pattern is widespread across rich western Europe, where indigenous birth rates have plunged. All sorts of reasons are offered \u2013 ranging from excessive laxity in admissions and visas to the attraction of English and a lack of ID cards \u2013 to explain the pull of Britain. It is certainly not the weather.</p> <p>All the same the sheer numbers are hard to justify, let alone sustain and, even if the Poles and other east Europeans go home as jobs dry up here and the pound depreciates, the government got its predictions badly wrong. Immigrants helped sustain the unsustainable boom, as David Cameron pointed out last week. He was not alone.</p> <p>Woolas would argue that we cannot keep out EU nationals (just watch those French do it! Krys the Polish Plumber is not as popular there as Joe the American plumber is at home) and that the skills-based points system, plus tighter in-and-out border controls are beginning to bite. </p> <p>Foreign nationals will start getting ID cards in late November and there could be a Queen's speech bill imposing more \"earned citizenship\" requirements \u2013 induction courses, that sort of thing - in December.<br>In other words, \"we're on the case.\"</p> <p>We'll see what difference that makes. A lack of data about people leaving the country (for what it's worth I think it was abolished to save money in the mid-90s) is a serious weakness. Visa enforcement is also poor. Yes, a lot of incomers are smart and motivated, but we have obligations to our own citizens too, don't we?</p> <p>At this point Woolas would say \"yes,\" adding \"British jobs for British workers\" of all colours. His Times interview was full of what I will politely call robust common sense about the need to learn English, for veiled Muslim wives to get out and work (\"even if that goes against their culture\"), the need to curb forced marriages (the age of spousal entry is to be raised from 18 to 21) and much else. </p> <p>He even takes a poke at first-cousin marriage as likely to increase disability among children: the risk doubles (to 4.7%) and, if grandparents were also first cousins, it shoots up to a startling 52%, Woolas claimed. I don't say don't do it, but be careful and get screened, he warned.</p> <p>If those figures are true, Woolas seems a touch too liberal for my taste. I don't want to contribute taxes to the cost of raising avoidably disabled children just because some people like to keep sex in the family in a time when science has told them how dangerous that old habit can be.</p> <p>But overall Woolas's tone fits into the Blunkett school of advocacy: he seeks in a no-nonsense way to call a spade a spade, as those whom Blunkett loves to dismiss as Hampstead liberals or \"Guardian-reading liberals\" (Woolas plays the same card) hesitate to do, even though few can now afford to live in Hampstead.</p> <p>What gives Woolas this right \u2013 or confidence? At grammar school in nearby Nelson in the late 60s he encountered the school's first non-white pupil, a Ugandan Asian refugee whom even the teachers (\"I thought it was appalling\") called Banana. </p> <p>The teachers! Can that be true, I wonder? Anyway Woolas joined Labour at 16 (he is now 48) to campaign against \"Paki-bashing\", went down the hill to university in Manchester, read philosophy and became NUS president \u2013 someone has to \u2013 later a GMB union official. He won his highly-marginal seat in 1997 and has moved gently up the promotion ladder towards his new bed of nails.</p> <p>To reinforce his belief that newcomers must not be left isolated or self-isolating Woolas will be contending that it requires action by both immigrants and the host society, as well as by government to give its policies credibility, a word he stresses. </p> <p>Jon Cruddas's complaints that the white working class feels neglected have resonance beyond Dagenham, the minister concedes.</p> <p>But immigrants want a properly enforced immigration policy too, he says, well aware that his majority in Oldham is less than his migrant electorate and that striking a false note would finish him off. Indeed it would. A happy warrior is Woolas, but he will need his flak jacket.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline for this article was changed on the afternoon of publication.</p>",

Marilynne Robinson, who continues the story of Gilead in Home, has written extensively about <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEEDB1738F934A35751C0A9\">the influence of John Calvin</a> on her thinking and work. Hemon has said he works in dialogue with <a href=\"http://www.powells.com/essays/hemon.html\">Bruno Schulz</a>, Danilo Kis, Isaac Babel and William Shakespeare, among others.<br> This expansiveness is not a new trend for the writers cited by this award. Previous winners have included Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 Jerzy Kosinski, the great Yiddish writer Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Canadian-born Saul Bellow and Ha Jin, who like Hemon taught himself to write fiction in English after coming to this country.</p> <p>In the late 60s and early 70s the award also had a prize for translation, but that component has since fallen by the wayside. Engdahl was right about this \u2013 American publishers and cultural institutions need to do a better job translating the world's literature. But many of our novelists have clearly absorbed the stylistic and moral challenges of the writers who have made it to these shores.</p> <p>And that continues, even if we have been kept in the dark about half of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/oct/09/nobel.prize.gustave.clezio\">Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl\u00e9zio's work</a>. Outside of these National Book award finalists, the hottest writer of the moment isn't an American at all, but a dead Chilean, Roberto Bolano, whose 1,000-page masterpiece, <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20395\">2666</a>, is the fall's most anticipated literary title.<br> No doubt in another 10 years a new generation of writers who grew up in Bolano's thrall will begin publishing, perhaps even becoming award finalists. It would be a shame if as a result of the broad black brush of some of this nation's stupid policies, they are tarred - before being read - as too \"ignorant\" or \"insular\" to play on the world stage.</p>",
  "<p>Say what you mean and mean what you say. This should be the first rule of working life. Straight talk, after all, is needed if you're going to show leadership, inspire others and bring people together as a team.</p> <p>So why, then, is jargon more popular than an ice-cream van outside a children's playground on a sweltering hot day? What makes otherwise sane human beings start wittering on about \"strategic implementation\", \"stakeholder engagement\" and \"deliverables\" as soon as they walk through the doors of an office?</p> <p>And why do people come out with stuff like this: \"Key objectives will be to implement the strategy recommendations, to work in partnership to schedule recommended strategic changes, and to track, monitor and report on implementation\"?</p> <p>When all they really mean is this: \"I'm going to make sure people do what they are told.\"</p> <p>Is it just that plain speaking takes a massive mental effort and your colleagues would rather sink back into a warm soapy bath of meaningless verbiage? And if so, how come they find no problem at all ditching the corporate-speak at the weekend? </p> <p>Sidle up to one of them as they add the finishing touches to their weekly shopping list on the bus to the supermarket and ask them what they're doing. They're hardly likely to tell you they're \"formulating a strategic plan of key deliverables for comestible replenishment over a seven-day time horizon\". If they did, the kindest reaction would be to take their temperature and suggest they go home for a lie-down and a cup of tea.</p> <p>No, jargon does not make life easy for anyone. What it does do, however, is make simple things sound much more complicated and impressive than they really are. Most of us are haunted by the secret fear that what we do all day isn't really that difficult, and that in many cases (think security guards, or the heads of Britain's major financial institutions) we could be replaced in a pinch by a baboon. </p> <p>So in rather the same way that telesales bods sometimes style themselves \"executive sales manager\" when all they are responsible for is a tray of paperclips, we all use jargon to dress up the humdrum reality of our jobs.</p> <p>Such little vanities may be understandable in the jungle that is today's working world. Less forgivable is the way people use jargon to perplex and bamboozle.</p> <p>Which brings us on to TLAs (three-letter abbreviations) - those pesky little clusters of letters thought to be the KPI (key performance indicator) needed for the long march to the SMT (senior management team) by CJAs (certified jargon addicts) everywhere.</p> <p>OK, I made that last one up, but TLAs, combined with light banter about core competencies, three-year roll-outs and monitoring and evaluation strategies, can conspire to bring understanding to a juddering halt. </p> <p>Yet, oddly enough, when pressed it is exactly the same CJAs who will most ardently claim to hate jargon. Raise the subject and a couple of hours later you'll find an earnest email from them in your inbox opining that we really need to work in partnership to incentivise non-jargon usage across the organisation.</p> <p>At which point you might think the only way to conquer jargon is to get a job at an NSO (that's non-speaking organisation to you lay readers). There's an excellent Trappist monastery, I'm told, near Coalville, Leicestershire.</p>",
  "<p>For anyone eagerly awaiting the next stage in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">EU-Russia</a> relations, last week's <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/16/content_10205382.htm\">European council</a> showed some ankle rather than a whole leg. The <a href=\"http://mnweekly.ru/news/20081016/55351197.html\">conclusions acknowledged</a> Russia's withdrawal from the Georgian \"buffer zones\" adjacent to Abkhazia and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">South Ossetia</a>, in line with last August's EU-negotiated peace agreement. But the rest of their thinking was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/eu-kosovo-brussels-summit\">put on ice</a>: instead of commenting now, the commission and the council will continue their comprehensive evaluation of EU-Russia relations in advance of the November 14 summit between the two sides. The commission will also consider the feasibility of a new \"Eastern partnership\" between the European Union, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova. It is not necessarily a bad thing that the EU is keeping its powder dry: indeed, it may better prepare Europe to take advantage of a change in the dynamic between Brussels and Moscow, when their negotiators meet. </p> <p>After all, Russia is weaker now than it was two months ago. There are two reasons for this, but they share a bottom line. First, oil prices have fallen, hard. When Russia clashed with Georgia last summer, the price of crude had just peaked at $145 a barrel. By October 15 that price had dropped below $75 for the first time in four years. Oil has recently provided around 30% of the Russian government's income: the recent price drop is a massive loss in prospective revenue. Second, Russia's stock market has taken a pounding. The RTS index dropped 70% between May and October, with losses so sharp and sudden that the Micex has adopted the novel tactic of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/12/russia-stock-markets\">shutting itself down</a> \u2013 sometimes for days at a time \u2013 to stem the flow. Partly due to global economic circumstances, these falls are also down to Russia's trigger-happy adventurism in the Caucasus. On August 7, Russian forces entered Georgia: on August 8, $6bn left Russia. By September 19, another $50bn was gone. Investors don't like wars \u2013 or deviations from the rule of law. </p> <p>In the sober light of economic reality, Medvedev understands that Russia must reassure the markets. To that end, we have seen more biddable behaviour from the Russian government: at least partial adherence to the peace agreement; a presidential speech floating the idea of a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/09/russia \">security pact</a> between Moscow and Nato; and open calls for more foreign direct investment from the west. The \u20ac4bn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/banking-iceland\">bail-out for Iceland</a> that Russia is apparently negotiating, and a closer military <a href=\"http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081016/117766697.html\">relationship with Syria</a> are down to Russia's pride on the one hand and its business sense on the other. Moscow is keen to maintain its strong image, but money is the true name of the game and its leaders knows they must therefore come to the table.</p> <p>A new partnership agreement between the EU and Russia is a fine goal in the long term; but first things first. Europe needs to show that it will neither abandon its allies on Russia's border, nor roll over when confronted by bad behaviour from Moscow. To that end, the EU should signal its continued support for an eastern partnership, the refusal of its member states to be part of any new pact that could undermine their security or the future role of Nato, and its expectation that Russia will abide by its commitments to peace. </p> <p>At next month's negotiations, Europeans should also raise the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-poison16-2008oct16,0,5763910.story\">case of Karina Moskalenko</a>, the prominent lawyer representing the family of murdered journalist and human rights activist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/15/anna-politkovskaya-pressandpublishing\">Anna Politkovskaya</a>. Last Monday, she was poisoned with mercury while in her car in Strasbourg. This is strongly reminiscent of the murder of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with polonium-210 two years ago in London. While this goes on we cannot talk about \"shared values\" as the Russians want us to: at most we can talk about mutual interests. The Russian leadership must show that it is not only innocent of ordering these crimes, but that it is able and willing to stop them from occurring. </p> <p>Vladimir Putin is the bare-chested tough guy who likes us to know that he can topple billionaire oligarchs, grind Chechen rebels into the dust and reshape the geography of Europe. Don't tell me he can't stop the murders of key activists who just happen to have opposed him publicly.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Evening. It mightn't be the greatest example of human empathy, but it can only be the thought of the misery and confusion that Spurs fans are experiencing, that is preventing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited\">Newcastle United</a> supporters from tossing their black and white striped toasters into the bath with them at present.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>The Magpies haven't won in six league and cup matches, and while a point at Everton in their last outing is perhaps the prelude to the first green shoots of recovery, the protracted search for new owners and the temporary nature of Joe Kinnear's position as manager, can't imbue Geordie hearts with much hope.</p> <p>Newcastle's cause isn't helped any by the absence of Michael Owen, who has been ruled out for a week with a groin strain, but Obafemi Martins is back in contention. Incidentally, can any Newcastle fans <a href=\"mailto:gregg.roughley@theguardian.com\">email me</a> and let me know what you think of Little Mickey O'. I get the impression he is merely tolerated on Tyneside. But what do I know?</p> <p>As for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a>, they have been playing Kevin Keegan-esque football of late. They've been scoring goals by the hatful, but conceding them by the bagful. Mark Hughes needs to find the right balance between attack and defence if he's to feel secure in the City hotseat. Plugging the hole in midfield might be a start. I'd stick old stager and former Newcastle man Dietmar Hamann in for tonight's encounter. But, again, what do I know? And as I'm in a questioning mood, what do you City fans make of Mark Hughes now? Have you accepted the former Old Trafford favourite yet? </p> <p><strong>My prediction:</strong> Newcastle 1-2 Man City</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The teams are in:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Newcastle:</strong> Given, Beye, Taylor, Coloccini, Bassong, Geremi,<br>Guthrie, Butt, Duff, Martins, Ameobi. <strong>Subs:</strong> Harper, Cacapa,<br>Jose Enrique, N'Zogbia, Xisco, Edgar, Carroll.</p> <p><strong>Man City:</strong> Hart, Richards, Ben-Haim, Dunne, Garrido,<br>Wright-Phillips, Kompany, Hamann, Ireland, Jo, Robinho. <strong>Subs:</strong><br>Schmeichel, Onuoha, Elano, Fernandes, Evans, Sturridge, Berti.<br><strong>Referee:</strong> Rob Styles (Hampshire)</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>So Hamann starts for City, which means I'm changing my prediction to Newcastle 1-2 Man City. The pace of Obafemi Martins will test City's defenders, but Micah Richards isn't exactly a slouch.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Pre-match emails:</strong> \"As a Newcastle fan I personally couldn't give two-hoots about Owen or any of the current players, aside from Shay,\" says Toon's very own David Thompson, with not a hint of a hoot. \"All I want to see happen is a new owner with genuine motives and a manager we can believe in. Don't care much if that is KK or not. Really want to see Shearer given shot and a good run at it.\" So there's a particularly frosty opinion of Little Mickey O'.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Pre-match build-up:</strong> The players are lined up in the tunnel and ready to take to the St James' Park turf. Robinho looks like the mascot besides such giants as Richard Dunne and Didi Hamann. Incidentally, this is Joe Kinnear's first match in charge of Newcastle at home so it will be interesting to see what kind of welcome he gets.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Another Mickey O' email:</strong> \"The human injury has been one of the biggest busts,\" says Pete Boyce in Chicago, forgetting Pamela Anderson, Jordan and Peggy from Eastenders. \"We should have sold Owen while we could. He's old news now, especially as he's out of the England picture too. Martins is the man really... he's like Owen was 10 years ago.\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>We're underway:</strong> Newcastle's players huddle together and the Geordie fans roar. Rob Styles blows his whistle really really hard and the match is off.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Despite leaving Newcastle when mobile phones were a novelty, Dietmar Hamann is still getting booed by the home fans. Ameobi elbows Richard Dunne in the side of the head , but the Irishman doesn't flinch.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Wright-Phillips breaks sharply up the right wing for City and wins a corner, which Newcastle make a meal of clearing. Eventually Coloccini stabs it away for a throw. City have made a commanding start.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Hamann starts a smart City move with a reverse pass to Stephen Ireland who brings Wright-Phillips into the game on the right. The little winger plays a one-two with Micah Richards and clips a ball towards Jo at the backpost, but the ball just drifts over the touchline.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> City are looking to utilise the pace of Wright-Phillips at every opportunity. \"Little Mickey O' was very good at Liverpool as was Ian Rush, but both are past it now,\" says Gary Naylor. Gary Naylor? Hang on, when did you start supporting Newcastle Gary? Isn't the situation at Everton stressful enough? \"Do the Toon Army look forward to seeing Torres in the black and white in 2019? Or Kuyt in 2009?\" I doubt it Gary. Meanwhile on Tyneside, Newcastle win a corner...</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Geremi has two attempts at a corner, but both are cleared comfortably. Martins picks up the second loose ball and drives towards the box, where he is felled by a clumsy challenge 20 yards from goal on the left hand side. Free-kick. Joe Hart screams at his wall to move right and Geremi takes a run up...</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> ...but Geremi hits it just a yard over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> City win a penalty!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Robinho is sent scampering through on goal and Beye makes a clean challenge from the left and just grazes the ball. Rob Styles points to the spot injustly and shows Beye the red card. Harsh!</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> <strong>Newcastle 0-1 Man City, Robinho.</strong> The Brazilian sends Given to the right and sweeps the ball in to the left. The Geordie fans scream 'cheat' at Rob Styles.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> When you're up against it you can never get a break. Spurs were down to 10 men after 10 minutes yesterday and now Newcastle find themselves with a mountain to climb. They gamely attack down the right with Duff however, but he is dispossessed and City break.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Micah Richards is sent into the inside-right channel by Robinho and Coloccini almost fells the big Manchester City right-back with a clumsy attempt to stab the ball clear from behind. Richards stays on his feet and Newcastle concede a corner instead of what could have been another penalty.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Newcastle need to regroup now. City are controlling play and using their extra man expertly as they knock the ball to feet comfortably in midfield. Guthrie and Butt look set to have a tiring night at the office. Guthrie shows his frustration by booting Stephen Ireland on the achilles. The former Liverpool player is lucky to escape a booking.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> \"Well another Rob Styles howler,\" says George Templeton. \"But he won't get punished for it because it is okay to screw up a big decision as long as they hurt teams like Newcastle and Bolton.\" Hang on George, are you saying that Newcastle are now officially a 'small' Premier League club? Disclaimer: No offence to Bolton fans is intended in this tit-for-tat exchange with Mr Templeton.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> City have made five times as many passes as Newcastle in the first quarter of the match. Two of those passes find Wright-Phillips on the right, who again wins a corner. He whips it towards Richards in the box, but the ball slides off his forehead and bounces out of play for a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> City's traveling supporting is ole-ing every pass already. Hamann picks the ball up and slides a short pass to Robinho. He jinks his way past Coloccini and plays a return pass with Ireland. The Brazilian then clips a shot at goal, but a deflection takes it towards Jo at the backpost, who just can't stretch his long legs far enough to deflect the ball past Given.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> An explanation from Evertonian Gary Naylor as to why he's so interested in Newcastle: \"Us Everton fans are indulging in displacement activity. From Wikipedia - 'displacement activities often involve actions to bring comfort such as scratching, drinking or feeding.' Or, obviously, laughing at Tottenham and Newcastle.\" Cheers Gary. This match has been spoiled by Rob Styles. Newcastle are having a go at attacking down City's weaker left hand-side though. Duff wins a free-kick in a dangerous area 30 yards from goal on City's right. Geremi prepares to swing it in.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Geremi plays an inviting ball to the far post, but Hart rushes out of his goal and punches the ball and Richard Dunne squarely in the chops. The big man is pole-axed by that.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Dunne gets to his feet like a dazed boxer and is taken off for treatment. Newcastle should make the most of the temporary 10-men v 10-men scenario.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Martins wins a header from a long ball and finds Ameobi. The big striker shows a touch of finesse with a beautifully weighted pass to Duff in the inside-right channel, but Duff curls his shot pitifully into the arms of Hart. Newcastle can't afford such profligacy when they're a man down. In fact, I'll re-phrase that: Newcastle can't afford such profligacy full-stop.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Dunne returns to the fray, so City have the one-man advantage restored. They attempt to slow play down with some laboured passing among the back four. It works. A hush descends upon St James' Park.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> MBM reader Duncan McVerry likens Rob Styles to a clown. \"This couldn't be the SAME Rob Styles who awarded Chelsea a penalty at Anfield last season when there was no contact? Or the same Rob Styles who awarded a penalty for Man Utd earlier this season when there was no foul? Could the SAME Rob Styles have awarded another Jackanory penalty? Is he wearing a big red nose, oversize shoes and is there a car with square wheels and doors that fall off anywhere to be seen?\" No he's wearing black and there's no car parked up anywhere near the Gallowgate end as far as I can see Duncan. If any doors explode though I'll be sure to let you know. Following a lull in play City go close after a corner on the left. Hamann wins a header which loops towards the far post but just lands on the roof of the netting.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> City seem intent to get through to half-time with their goal advantage intact. They continue to keep possession without looking interested in going forward. Mark Hughes looks a little peeved.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> <strong>Goal!</strong> Newcastle 1-1 Man City. Ameobi.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Did I say Mark Hughes looked peeved? He'll be furious now. Newcastle, quite aptly, score a comedy goal. Martins hits a shot from 20 yards which deflects off Duff to Dunne. The big Irish defender whacks his clearance into Coloccini. The ball then lands at startled Ameobi's feet 10 yards from goal, and showing all the composure of a man who hadsn't scored in two years, he lashes wildly at the ball and somehow slices it into the right of the goal. Classic comedy action.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Well what a half. I'd written Newcastle off, but thanks to a malignant complacency spreading through the Man City team and some healthy character from Newcastle's players, the Toon are back from behind. I'm off to get a half-time cup of tea. Your emails to follow...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Half-time emails:</strong> \"Whatever happened to Damien Duff?\" asks Tom Chivers. \"It's sad. He was absolutely amazing at Blackburn and even for a while at Chelsea; there was a time when it was hard to say who was better, him or Robben. Now it's hard to say who's worse, him or Harry Kewell - which is a tragic little tale in its own right. (Disclaimer: Harry Kewell may have become really good since he wandered off to Turkey; I don't know but I doubt it)\" Interesting Tom, and also, what is it with left wingers and injuries? Robben, Duff and Kewell are all in-for-a-week-out-for-a-month kind of players. Please, no obvious jokes about that last description.</p> <p>\"In reply to Duncan McVerry's question,\" says Kevin Titman. \"I would hazard the following guesses as to Rob Styles' form of transport, especially after the game: bullet-proof stretch limo, with plenty of boot room for rather dog-eared red and yellow cards or a St John's ambulance.\" For his sake I hope he's not getting a train, as he seems to miss everything (apologies).</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Rob Styles runs out to a vitriolic reception from the Newcastle faithful. City begin the second half kicking right to left on my tellybox if that helps you paint a picture in your minds. Martins runs into trouble on the edge of the Newcastle box and Stephen Ireland tries to chip Given from 18 yards, but doesn't get the required lift.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Duff is fouled for Newcastle. Free-kick 35 yards from goal on the right. Geremi swings a great ball in towards the back post, but nobody gambles on it and the ball drifts out for a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Wright-Phillips is bundled out of play on the right by Bassong. Garrido whips the ball towards the front-post but Newcastle clear easily. Meanwhile in the Guardian.co.uk offices. A colleague of mine has just admitted he has a man-crush on Robinho. He's 'pretty' and has 'grace' apparently. Couldn't say the same for Richard Dunne really.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Newcastle are proving more combative opponents early in the second half. A combination of Nicky Butt's studs and Danny Guthrie's shins wins the ball back in midfield. Guthrie sends Martins scampering down the left wing, but the striker lacks support and City win back possession. I expect Newcastle to try to hold on for the draw. This might not rate high on the fun-factor scale...</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Jo has been far from impressive for City. He has failed to compete any time he has received the ball with his back to goal and had the attentions of a defender to shrug off. This time Bassong easily dispossesses Jo, who falls to the floor in the vain hope of a free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Bassong then steams into Richards and leaves the right-back prone on the turf. He's taken off for treatment and might need to be replaced. The physicality continues as Butt trips Robinho 35 yards out. The resulting free-kick comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Richards is replaced by Onuoha. That's a blow for City as Richards had kindled a tidy understanding with Wright-Phillips on the right wing, who is still proving City's most potent threat.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Kompany sends a fine strike from 30 yards straight into the arms of Given, but Newcastle deserve credit for limiting City to long range efforts. They're working as a unit and look to have belief. Perhaps Kinnear is recreating that Wimbledon thing...</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> <strong>Goal! Newcastle 2-1 Man City, Dunne (og)</strong></p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> What a turn up for the books this could be. Martins wins a corner on the right, which Geremi swings into the centre of the penalty area. With not a Newcastle player within two yards of him, Richard Dunne side-foots it into the top right-hand corner. I think that's called karma.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> \"Did Kinnear see this Newcastle goal [the first] or had he wandered off to the dressing room early again?\" asks Andy Waddington. \"He missed both goals at Everton because he left early and returned late for half time. So should he just stay at home and watch on TV since they can't score with his overbearing presence?\" Definitely not Andy. He's witnessed both these goals, and don't quote me on this, but I'm sure he gave Richard Dunne his hateful 'Geordie press' stare before the big defender shanked that one into his own goal.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Ched Evans is on for Dietmar Hamann, as City now have to change the game. So much for my theory of Hamann being able to bolt the back door. The young Welshman immediately makes an impact by trying to chip the ball over Given, who deflects the ball out for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Wright-Phillips swings the ball into Jo, who heads powerfully at goal, but Given again shows his reactions are up among the best in the Premier League, by tipping the ball over for another corner. City are cranking up the pressure.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Martins is replaced by N'Zogbia. Martins has worked hard on his comeback and gets a healthy round of applause as he leaves the field. Wright-Phillips eventually lofts the corner into the box. But it has no venom and Given easily plucks it out of the air.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> N'Zogbia plays a tidy one-two with Duff who races clear on his favoured left wing. The Irishman sends a low cross in to Ameobi, but he can't wrap his foot around the ball to direct it into the corner and drills it wide.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Robinho finally arouses from his slumber and jinks past Coloccini before clipping a disguised shot towards the left-hand-side of the goal. But Given stretches sharply and collects the ball into his midriff. Mark Hughes' men are lacking invention. Duff breaks for Newcastle and finds N'Zogbia inside him whose shot from an impossible range is deflected out for a throw.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Shola Ameobi is given a hero's exit as he makes way for Andy Carroll. He's put a shift in, and scored, albeit fortuitously.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Steven Taylor and Ched Evans try to win man-points on the left touchline. Evans eyeballs Taylor, who towers over him, before Rob Styles does something sensible for a change and tells them to stop acting like kids and get on with the game.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Mark Hughes makes his final change and replaces Garrido with Daniel Sturridge. He'll inject some pace into the City attack, if not a particularly great first touch.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Given makes a match-winning save. His Irish compatriot Stephen Ireland takes the ball on the chest 25 yards from goal and hits a vicious curling volley low to Given's right-hand-side. But Given somehow gets an incredibly strong hand to the ball and deflects it straight in front of him where he picks it up and snuffs out the danger. So that's why Given is loved on Tyneside...</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>85 min: Goal! Newcastle 2-2 Man City, Ireland:</strong> Did I say match-winning save? Hmmm. Anyway, Robinho just showed why he's worth so much money; the Brazilian turns sharply after Dean Sturridge finds him 25 yards from goal and instantly rolls the ball to the on-rushing Ireland who finishes smartly to Given's left. So much for that Given save.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Ireland almost wins it. Evans plays him in the right hand channel, where this time, slightly closer to Given, the Irishman just drags his shot wide. City are going to try and nick this.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> Newcastle are showing signs of exhaustion. Guthrie runs out of steam as he tries to break and Ben-Haim steals possession. Wright-Phillips breaks and wins a corner. Tyneside collectively groans as four minutes of injury time are announced.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Sturridge connects with Wright-Phillips' corner but his header flies into the relieved Geordies packed behind the goal.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> Newcastle cleverly hold possession in the left-hand corner, although Carroll feels the wrath of Richard Dunne's boots as the City defender clouts him and wins back possession.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90+4 min:</strong> City clear but that's it at St James' Park. Rob Styles blows for full-time and Newcastle win a deserved point.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>Full-time musings:</strong> Newcastle more than warranted their point. They suffered another Rob Styles howler and through hard-work and a slice of their own luck managed to claw their way back into a match they looked sure to lose. After failing to win in three matches and throwing away leads in their last two, Mark Hughes might be feeling a little less than safe in his own position at Man City, despite assurances from the new owners.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/20/barack-obama-colin-powell\">Colin Powell's endorsement of Barack Obama</a> not only was a vote of confidence in the Democratic candidate but also a sharp critique of the direction of the Republican party. Powell echoed the backlash by many moderate Republicans against the social conservatives that have come to dominate the party's politics.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nh_c5bbvmqc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Nh_c5bbvmqc&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/Nh_c5bbvmqc&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Colin Powell is not the only moderate Republican who is concerned with the direction of his party. In Arizona, I spoke with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slade_Mead\">Slade Mead</a>, who writes the blog <a href=\"http://thedryheat.com/\">The Dry Heat</a>. In 2002, he ran as a pro-public education candidate and was elected to the Arizona Senate. But after his election, he recalls a discussion of the Republican caucus where members asked: \"How do we dismantle public schools?\"</p> <p>\"My blood ran cold. I couldn't believe that I was listening to this conversation. I believe that the strength of our system is an educated populace,\" he said. The Republican caucus wanted to dismantle public education to save money and to give vouchers to parents so they could send their children to religious or charter schools.</p> <p>Mormon's make up 18% of the population in Arizona, and they represent a strong conservative bloc in Arizona politics, he added. \"Their goal is a faith-based school system.\"</p> <p>\"I got disgusted. I couldn't look myself in the mirror after coming out of those meetings,\" he added, and he finally broke ranks against the budget his party proposed. He was exiled from the Republican party and lost a bitterly fought primary campaign in the next election. </p> <p>In neighbouring New Mexico, a veteran Republican told me how social conservatives had pushed moderates out of positions of power in the party. He wouldn't go on the record because he said, \"They have an interesting way of of punishing the messenger.\"</p> <p>When I asked him to elaborate, he said: \"They will try to kill your business.\" </p> <p>It has left little room for Republicans who focus on fiscal issues and pragmatic policies, he said. The philosophy of moderate Republicans is compassionate conservatism. While moderate Republicans may not support government giveaway programmes, they do support programmes that help people to help themselves.</p> <p>He's quick to point that activists have taken over both parties from time to time, eventually forcing the parties from power and bringing about a realignment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/\">New Mexican political blogger Joe Monahan</a> said that this election could lead to Republicans being out of power for a generation. \"Republicans have ceded the economic edge in this recession,\" he said. And traditional social wedge issues such as gay marriage or abortion won't have much traction.</p> <p>\"The ultimate wedge issues is fear and whether you have a roof over your head. It will change the face of this country for a lifetime,\" he said.<br><em><br>The Guardian's Suzanne Goldenberg is speaking to religious conservatives in Colorado Springs. On Tuesday, she reports how they are preparing for defeat and asking what went wrong. </em></p>"
