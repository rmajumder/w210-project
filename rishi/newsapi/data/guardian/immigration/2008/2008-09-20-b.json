  "<p>Past the grey monoliths of Stonehenge, up a twisting country lane, down a bumpy track, through a white gate and straight into the country idyll that is Cannwood. A grand Queen Anne house overlooks a garden decorated with giant plant pots, a converted cow shed and a vast silver sculpture. Within 10 minutes of arriving at Daisy Garnett's family house in Somerset, I am presented with strong coffee and a delicious omelette. It's a pretty perfect place to be on a sodden Sunday morning in August. </p> <p>It's barely 10am but the extended family is already crammed into the farmhouse-style kitchen, leafing through the papers and crunching toast. Garnett, 36, is already prepping lunch, chopping strawberries and sprinkling them with sugar while working out what needs to be picked in the vegetable garden. A British journalist whose first job was as a staff writer on American Vogue, Garnett was asked last year to write a book about learning to cook while sailing the Atlantic. Cooking Lessons is an absorbing read, progressing from Garnett's tales of roasting her first chicken (upside down, in a reluctant galley oven) to becoming an accomplished home cook. </p> <p>The interspersed recipes are mostly borrowed from Garnett's ever-expanding collection of cook books, which numbers the River Caf\u00e9 series, Roast Chicken and Other Stories by Simon Hopkinson, and the Ballymaloe Cookery Course, which Garnett refers to as her 'bible cookbook'; she did a course at the prestigious Ballymaloe Cookery School in East Cork last year and learnt how to deal with difficult fish and intimidating sauces. There are also recipes given to her by friends, and dozens of simple but useful personal tips, from just the right amount of pasta to cook per person to buying carrots and potatoes still covered in dirt (it seals in their flavour and means they haven't been washed in heavily chlorinated water). </p> <p>It is five years since Garnett moved back to London from the small sailing boat, and in that time she has become obsessed by food. At one point in the book she admits that she grew up thinking of cooking as 'something other people did'. Yet, when her sister Rose recently returned from a trip to Rome raving about pine-nut ice cream, Garnett spent ages trying to work out how to make it herself. The recipe appears at the start of the book, and it's certainly inspirational for those of us who think ice cream is something other people make.</p> <p>Back to the Sunday morning kitchen. Garnett's mother, journalist and writer Polly Devlin, wonders aloud when her third daughter, Bay, will go into labour. Without waiting for an answer, she goes off to her study to write. Rose, a journalist and film producer, is peeling the skins off individual broad beans with her father, Andy. Rose's young sons, George and Frankie, talk about food and football while her husband Tom Browne, an actor, screenwriter and director chats to family friend Tom Cairns, a theatre, opera and film director. Opera Tom peers out of the window at the dark grey clouds racing past and announces that we will be just fine to eat outside. The Toms and Garnett's boyfriend Nick, who works at publishers 4th Estate, discuss when to fire up the barbecue to cook the beef. They consult Garnett, who is podding peas. </p> <p>The Garnetts are a busy family. Until he was diagnosed with MS, Andy was an engineer and inventor who rebuilt Cannwood (a near ruin when he and Polly bought it in 1983). Their land has expanded from nine to over 100 acres and it's an oasis of wild beauty: an overflowing vegetable garden protected by carrier bags recycled as scarecrows; a meadow with rare orchids; a fruit cage; a herb garden. Then there's the tennis courts, the swimming pool framed by roses and a grotto created in the stump of a burr elm. Animals abound, from hens and geese to cats and dogs. </p> <p>Years at Cannwood have taught Garnett to use seasonal and local food by seeing what's on offer in the garden or at the market. It has little to do with following fashion; she says it's just the sensible way to cook. And she's keen to point out that although she has only become immersed in cookery recently, she has always been a good eater. In fact, she became interested in cooking in New York, some time before the boat trip. It was Stateside that she realised that cooking could actually be pleasurable. </p> <p>There she met Nell Campbell, co-owner of two New York restaurants, and through Nell met Rose Gray of the River Caf\u00e9. One long weekend on Shelter Island, Garnett watched Nell, Gray and other friends make fish stew. She ate her first bruschetta, discovered Maldon salt and sourdough bread. She learnt from Gray that good quality Italian olive oil is a core ingredient of good cooking, that sprigs of herbs are no use - that Gray wanted 'fistfuls of thyme, marjoram, oregano and mint. Campbell was sous chef to Gray. I was galley slave,' says Garnett, laughing. 'I learnt so much from watching. In fact, I didn't realise how much had soaked in until I started to cook myself.' </p> <p>Devlin appears and sternly tells a pug called Archie to stop his 'gothic cough'. She looks at Garnett, who has tears in her eyes as she grates fresh horseradish. 'What's she been telling you? She's a born cook. Really, she is.'</p> <p>As her mother takes vegetable peel out to the hens, Garnett mixes cr\u00e8me fraiche from London's Borough Market into the horseradish. She is feeling slightly up against it. Today's lunch, for 11 adults, including the military historian Sir John Keegan and his wife, who live locally 'has to be ready at around 1pm. I have to say that having a deadline makes the whole process less relaxed.' Most of the time, Garnett cooks at home for Nick. They rarely eat out ('it's so bloody expensive!') and never fast food. 'My version of a ready-made meal is a bit of prosciutto and cheese with bread. Or I put loads of oil in a frying pan, add tomatoes and some basil, let it simmer and you've got amazing pasta sauce with no sugar and minimal salt.' </p> <p>The skies are ominous but everyone is determined to eat outside, where a large canopy billows above the table. It's just past 1pm and the food starts to emerge from the kitchen. The meat comes from Borough Market and all the vegetables from Cannwood - apart from the potatoes. There's seared beef fillet and rump steak, the fresh horseradish, new potatoes with parsley and mint, homemade mayonnaise, roast beetroot (cooked in their skins with generous helping of smoked Maldon salt and scattered with thyme) and a warm dish of broad beans, fresh peas, courgette and prosciutto. Immersed in the elementary pleasure of eating, everyone is silent. </p> <p>Garnett announces that pudding will be meringue roulade with strawberries and cream, mulberry and berry ice cream and sorbet. The mulberries are from Garnett's Brixton garden while the red and black currants and raspberries all come from Cannwood. </p> <p>I ask Garnett if she ever has kitchen nightmares. 'I was making meringues in a hurry yesterday. I turned on the grill instead of the oven and they ended up all black on top. They smelt delicious, like burned sugar. Everyone thought I was making cr\u00e8me caramel. I was like, \"No, I burned my bloody meringues!\" I always come clean.'</p> <p>Just as we are finishing coffee and eating Turkish delight, the heavens open. For once, no one much minds. We are all just thankful that, while sailing home from America, Garnett realised cooking was something she could do, too. </p> <p>Daisy Garnett's Cooking Lessons: Tales from the Kitchen and Other Stories is published by Quadrille, \u00a312.99.

Hull and halve or quarter the strawberries, depending on their size. Sprinkle with a dessertspoonful of sugar, and leave for half an hour or so (longer is fine).</p> <p>Place the egg whites in the spotlessly clean bowl of a food mixer. You can whip the egg whites by hand but to get them really stiff will require a lot of whipping. If you have a food mixer, use it. If so, break the whites up with the whisk, add the sugar all in one go and whisk to a stiff peak. This will take about 7 or 8 minutes. If you are whipping the whites by hand, whip them till they are stiff first, then add the sugar in about three goes, whipping all the time, till the egg whites become glossy and stiff. </p> <p>Line a 20 x 30cm swiss-roll tin or a baking tray with sides with tin foil. Brush the tin foil fairly liberally with a non-scented oil such as sunflower or groundnut oil. Spread the meringue into the tin and smooth it out to the edges. Bake for 15 -20 minutes, until slightly risen with a brittle crust on top. Put a clean tea towel on your work counter and, as soon as you take the roulade out of the oven, turn it out straight onto the tea towel quick smart. Carefully remove the tin foil and allow the meringue to cool. </p> <p>Spread the whipped cream carefully over the meringue, but not right up to the edges, and scatter the strawberries and juices on top of the cream. Have the wide edge of the meringue nearest you, as the roulade should be rolled up from this side. Have a large flat serving plate between you and the roulade and roll the meringue up and on to the plate using the tea towel. Decorate as you wish. I like to use sprigs of mint and wild strawberries if I have any.</p>",
  "<p>It would be understandable were John le Carr\u00e9 to sit back, plump up the laurels (if you can do that to laurels) and rest up. In a writing career spanning five decades he has, after all, defined the spy novel, lifting it into the realms of literature, and given us some of the most memorable characters, set pieces and films of the post-1945 era. But he is stubbornly, exuberantly determined to keep exploring, in a world beset with wholly new paranoias, the men and (equally crucially) women who do bad and good by stealth. His new novel is basically a tale of guilty anger - on the part of the Hamburg spies who failed so miserably to latch on to Mohammed Atta and his colleagues; and on the part of the Brits and the Yanks who, desperate for success, are prepared to crawl over anyone for the sake of one small triumph, one imam they can 'turn'.</p> <p>Into Hamburg, then, sneaks a tortured Russian, possibly a Chechen, with scars both mental and physical and, most pertinently, the key to a safety deposit box containing the substantial and wholly ill-gotten gains of his late and despised father, one of the KGB colonels who used Western banks to turn black money white in the dying days of Soviet Russia. Enter the likable but hapless owner of the British (but Hamburg-based) private bank that had been used for these 'Lipizzaner' deals (the famous horses are born black but turn white with age). Enter a difficult, delicately drawn female human-rights lawyer who sees in Issa, the refugee, the chance to make amends for previous deportations she failed to prevent. Enter, sotto voce, at least three national espionage networks, watching and planning their three-dimensional chess. The Germans, led by the intensely affable Gunther Bachmann, the book's finest character, see a chance to use Issa to compromise a 'moderate' Muslim TV cleric whose charities follow some odd conduits. The Americans want to come in all guns blazing, not just figuratively. The Brits want to skulk, threaten, wheedle, double-cross and steal credit.</p> <p>What le Carr\u00e9 has always done terrifically is to capture the nuances of the spying game. His spooks are wonderful. You find yourself believing you are in that room, quietly rooting for whoever commands your allegiance at that moment. He paints the scene so fully in his own mind before writing that you forget you're reading fiction: every cough, every glance, each sip of bottled water feels as if it were part of a scrupulously honest documentary. It is also a delight to read a man who believes in proper continuity, when so many lesser thriller writers have waiters arriving with the first course three seconds after the diners have met.</p> <p>Where le Carr\u00e9 falls down, I think, is in capturing the burgeoning (or is it?) love triangle between the pretty lawyer, the rich but rubbish banker and the (frankly unlikable) refugee. Did Issa boff Annabel? Will Tommy get her instead? Frankly, who cares? This too-huge subplot fails to grip, and simply points up how much more riveting the real action is. Le Carr\u00e9's minor characters are never less than spot-on, but his three main ones are oddly shoehorned into emotions that we, the readers, fail to share with them. (And besides, Issa is so annoying that if the gung-ho Americans ever did end up fitting him for a dinky orange boiler-suit, I don't think too many readers would be weeping.)</p> <p>But these failures aren't too disastrous. Relish, instead, the knowledge this book imparts about the men who have learnt to talk just below the level of hotel music, and say small things with huge import; about the impossible moral M\u00f6bius strip handed to Western liberals by Islamicist jihad. In A Most Wanted Man you are, unlike the modern world, in thrillingly deft, safe hands.</p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch - it's mostly bad news, but you already know all about that. What you might not know, is that the credit crunch has got some upsides too. No - really! Here are 11, for starters. </p> <p><strong>1 Doggy bags</strong></p> <p>Bag it up, take it home, stick it in the fridge, et voila! Reheated leftovers is the molecular gastronomy of the credit-crunched future, as far as OFM's concerned; and oh dear God, how amazing is bubble and squeak? </p> <p><strong>2 It's game over for the wine snob <br></strong><br>Ghastly, sneering, superior creature who doesn't understand that wine is for fun and for getting drunk, and not for waffling on about tiresomely at every opportunity. Happily, the Wine Snob's fondness for expensive and challenging booze is somewhat nixed by current trends in absolute flat brokedness. It's now definitely much cleverer to know that Aldi's wine buyer, Danny Gibson, totally knows his onions and therefore there is precisely nil shame in tripping up to a dinner party with a bottle of Aldi's \u00a33.99 Pinot Grigio Romato tucked under your arm, and change for the bus fare home chirpily rattling in your pocket. (Yeah, technically Gibson's a wine snob, a fact which could be said to undermine our entire premise; but he's a professional wine snob, so we'll let that pass.)</p> <p><strong>3 And for the foodie </strong></p> <p>There is no room for olive oil that costs a smidgeon over three quid, for tomatoes that have their own pedigree certificate, for Iberico that costs more, per slice, than a unit of your gas bill; as a result, there's no room for the Foodie, who thrives on such wild decadence. No. Great. Loss. PS. We never really liked white truffle all that much. We just said we did.</p> <p><strong>4 It's legit to order tap </strong></p> <p>More than legitimate - it's de rigeur. Ecological concerns have made mineral water spiritually suspect, economic concerns have made it as vulgar as Jodie Marsh on a hen do. As a consequence, clever bars and restaurants have thrown themselves into the business of tarting up their tap, with excellent results. London's The East Room does it in jugs laden with mint and lime and ice and it's like bloody nectar, we tell you.</p> <p><strong>5 The rebirth of the comedy meat cuts <br></strong><br>Our favourite? Brisket. So retro and ration-y.</p> <p><strong>6 The rebirth of meat<br></strong><br>Oh, mince! Spaghetti bolognaise and chilli con carne, cottage pie and Cornish pasties! Through more affluent times, mince inhabits a perpetually dim-lit hinterland of fashionability, on account of the fact that it's, well - cheap and not very posh. But now that cheap and not-posh is all the rage, mince is back. Mince pride, people!</p> <p><strong>7 The recourse to student food</strong></p> <p>We're not actually qualified nutritionists (surprise!), but by our reckoning, a fish-finger sandwich with a sizeable portion of frozen peas and a good dollop of tommy sauce, is a frugal, balanced and tasty meal. (Sadly, we are forced to accept that our other undergraduate fave - crispy chicken fillets, potato waffles and baked beans - is probably not especially balanced. You can tell, it's predominantly orange.)<br><strong><br>8 Quality choc mania </strong> </p> <p>Posh choc, it seems, is the Chanel lipstick of the credit crunched world: it's the luxury with which we spoil ourselves, when we can't afford to spoil ourselves on a grander scale. Sales of quality choc are through the roof. Two words of warning though ... sometimes, a Twix is just much nicer; and, never ever preface a quality-choc nosh session with the following words: 'Wouldn't you just die for one square of very high quality choc? And by that I mean, 70 per cent cocoa content minimum...', because that's vile talk. Especially if you're a man. </p> <p><strong>9 Crisps as starters</strong></p> <p>We're not beyond a nice dip too, if we're pushing the boat out.</p> <p><strong>10 Own-brand chic </strong></p> <p>Sales of Sainsbury's own-brand products are up 6 per cent on last year, while branded goods are up a piffling 3 per cent; suddenly, paying 19p for a tin of chopped tomatoes and 16p for a can of mushy peas is a clever and elegant thing to do. Hoorah! <br><strong><br>11 Lidl's must-have bag </strong></p> <p>Cool as Christmas, with its pop-art graphic, and its endless capacity for carrying stuff. Introducing 2008's I'm Not A Plastic Bag (and it is plastic!).</p>",
  "<p>James Hewitt was 'Gentleman Jim' without a trace of irony. Lee Sharpe was, inevitably, 'Sharpe Shooter' and Iwan Thomas, the eventual winner, was 'The Dragon'. In bright outfits, amid high fives and histrionics, they fought out contests such as 'Murder Ball' and 'Armed and Dangerous'. This was Celebrity Wrestling in 2005, and its ratings of 2.6 million were among ITV1's worst on a Saturday night in its 50-year history. </p> <p>It seemed proof that celebrity-led reality formats had hit a brick wall. Moreover, given the rise of digital channels and the internet, Celebrity Wrestling smacked of desperation at the inexorable decline of that most nostalgic of family gatherings: Saturday night television. </p> <p>But on BBC1, something was stirring. The corporation had dropped its own clanger in 2004 with Johnny Vaughan and Denise Van Outen's Passport to Paradise, but redeemed itself with a surprise hit called Strictly Come Dancing. A year later it was breathing life into a seemingly moribund concept by reviving Doctor Who, starring Christopher Eccleston as the Time Lord and Billie Piper as his assistant. At the time it seemed like a risky \u00a310m gamble on a show that had petered out before. But thanks to Russell T Davies's reinvention and state-of-the-art computer graphics, the sci-fi drama trounced the opposition and brought families back to the Saturday night living room in their millions. Crucially, it appealed to both parents and children, male and female.</p> <p>Three years on, David Tennant has assumed control of the Tardis and Saturday night viewing has regenerated in dramatic style. It is not just a matter of ratings, though these continue to improve. Saturday night TV is less likely to be sneered at than to get people of all ages and classes debating the latest Doctor Who cliffhanger or X Factor reject. When Paul Potts sang 'Nessun Dorma' for Britain's Got Talent, it became a YouTube sensation and made a mockery of the idea of a typical ITV1 viewer.</p> <p>Popular dramas are playing their part, but it is the celebrity-led reality format that has come back from the dead. But now, wrestling is out, ballroom dancing is in. Last night, approaching 10 million viewers were expected to watch the first live show in the new series of Strictly Come Dancing, presented by Tess Daly and Bruce Forsyth, 37 years after he first hosted The Generation Game. It has been reinforced by a publicity blitz featuring one of the more unlikely contestants, BBC journalist John Sergeant, and throughout its run - the longest yet - can expect help from a steady trickle of tabloid stories about its behind-the-scenes soap opera. Last year's final was watched by 12 million people, still low compared with the Morecambe and Wise era when viewing choice was limited, but an increase of 30 per cent from the first series.</p> <p>At 7.30 last night Strictly Come Dancing gave way to Merlin, an ambitious magical fantasy starring Colin Morgan, Anthony Head and Richard Wilson, the BBC's thinly disguised attempt to fill the Doctor Who slot after the less successful Robin Hood. But ITV1 has recovered from its 2005 nadir. It took on Merlin with one of its big guns, The X Factor, masterminded by Simon Cowell, arguably the man who has done more than anyone to revive ratings and generate millions of pounds. Watched by more than nine million viewers, the acerbic Cowell was joined by Cheryl Cole, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh judging the singing talents of this year's hopefuls.</p> <p>Under siege from multi-channel TV and video on demand, BBC1 and ITV1 have reasserted themselves on Saturday nights, sometimes achieving an audience share of nearly 70 per cent. It is a return to the old certainties when two superpowers fought a war of attrition for ratings supremacy. This year, the climax of ITV1's Britain's Got Talent, another brainchild of Cowell, slugged it out for an audience of 20 million with the final of BBC1's I'd Do Anything, a live public audition for the role of Nancy in a new West End production of Oliver!. Minority channels could hardly get a look in, many computers and PlayStations had the night off, numerous dates were put on hold. Telly was back in business.</p> <p>'What Saturday night TV has pulled off is a hell of an achievement, making everything bigger, stronger and more compelling,' said Peter Bazalgette, the media consultant and former producer of Channel 4's Big Brother. 'To create family viewing that satisfies small children, teenagers, adults etcetera, the stakes are incredibly higher because there are so many distractions for all of them now.'</p> <p>The shows contain a heady cocktail of celebrity, popular music, elation or humiliation, and a sporting competition in which the viewers have a stake because they vote for the winners and losers. Bazalgette added: 'Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor have taken the old talent show format, like Opportunity Knocks in the Sixties, and made it like Survivor and Big Brother with a narrowing so that people fall out. There is a strong story arc, and people vote so they have an emotional investment. The contestants are given an enormous amount of training so they will give good performances. They have added buckets of flavour on a Saturday night and it shows TV as a medium is not dead.'</p> <p>Saturdays are now the showcase for 'event television', a rearguard action against the predicted death of the schedule. In an era when you can record a programme at the touch of Sky+, or catch up with it later on the BBC's iPlayer, why bother to dash home for a particular show on a Saturday - or any other time? The answer is that you will if it's live, if you have the chance to vote, and if the results are likely to be plastered over the next morning's papers or talked about in the office on Monday. Like a live football match, these shows have their purchase in the here and now, especially important for ITV1 as a rare occasion when adverts have a captive audience. Each finale has become a national event.</p> <p>Elaine Bedell, the BBC's controller of entertainment commissioning, has said: 'There's no question that there seems to be a rejuvenation in communal viewing. People are sitting down together on Saturday nights desperate to watch the shows, because however many catch-up services there are, they know people will be talking about it the next day and they want to be part of that.'</p> <p>The hits are also meticulously geared towards what ITV's Peter Fincham, when he was controller of BBC1, described as '3GTV', or three-generation television. These appeal to children, parents and grandparents alike. Jay Hunt, controller of BBC1, said weekend TV is making 'shows with cross-generational appeal'. She added: 'When we approach Saturday nights the ambition is to put together a schedule that will hold an audience for the whole evening.' </p> <p>Forsyth, 80, believes Strictly Come Dancing has perfected this art of triangulation. 'The X Factor caters for a certain type of viewer, but we cater for everyone,' he said recently. 'Children love Strictly Come Dancing - they see something on television they've never seen before. They see PlayStation but don't see actual human beings twirling round the floor. Then you go right up the whole age group to people of 80 and 90, like myself, who remember ballroom dancing from when we were teenagers.'</p> <p>ITV1 sought to hit back with Dancing on Ice, but truly discovered its '3GTV' audience with Britain's Got Talent, presented by Ant and Dec. Last year's winner, opera singer Paul Potts, brought tears to the eyes of judge Amanda Holden, and was succeeded by teenage breakdancer George Sampson, who started busking because his mother couldn't afford to pay for his dance classes.</p> <p>It is all and meat and drink to the press, which both feeds off and generates hype around the show. Britain's Got Talent is a platform for rags-to-riches stories and emotional high and low notes. Choirboy Andrew Johnston's rendition of 'Pie Jesu' was moving, while Asian dancing duo Signature's routine was simply hilarious. It was watched by 14 million people, a reawakening of shared experience viewing on a national scale. It has been speculated that the trend will grow as families stay at home because the economic downturn has forced them to reduce Saturday evening spending.</p> <p>Claudia Rosencrantz, who as controller of entertainment at ITV until 2005 commissioned X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, said: 'In the 10 years I was responsible for Saturday nights at ITV there was a constant debate over whether it was in terminal decline. Gladiators and Blind Date had done them proud for years but they were coming to the end of their lives. Saturday nights were in the doldrums.'</p> <p>But when Rosencrantz commissioned Popstars and the hugely successful Pop Idol, the tide began to turn. 'I wanted to prove Saturday night telly wasn't dead,' she added. 'The big challenge - which is incredibly difficult to pull off - is to have that broad appeal, from nine to 90. You have to take timeless themes and subjects that resonate deeply. People enjoy watching something inclusive on Saturday nights. I think there's an appetite for well-made glossy entertainment shows that are compelling. You can breathe new life into them.'</p> <p>The current crop of talent shows could one day face a loss of novelty value, as Big Brother has done, leaving a gap for yet another format to be rediscovered. Andrew O'Connor, a former actor who set up Objective Productions, said: 'If both channels are doing the same thing you wonder how long it can continue. Everyone wants to know what's next. The genre that hasn't been reinvented for a family audience is magic - we'd like to be the company that does that.' </p> <p>Despite their resurgence, Strictly Come Dancing and X Factor's viewing figures will not challenge the landmark shows of the past. Before the advent of cable and satellite, Morecambe and Wise regularly attracted more than 20 million. In 1979, when The Generation Game dominated Saturday night, BBC1 hit record viewing figures of 25 million. But by the time Jim Davidson was sacked as the show's host in 2002, it had sunk to 3.3 million.</p> <p>It seems that no show can dominate Saturday night for ever, however cleverly repackaged. For Brucie and Co there may be trouble ahead - but while there's moonlight and music and love and romance, let's face the music and dance.</p> <h2>Let's face the music and dance ... straight into the tabloids</h2> <p>It's not just the sequins, straight backs and six-packs of the female professional fox-trotters that make 'Strictly' - as it's known - an enduring Saturday-night hit. The drama, both on screen and off, draws millions of viewers every week and spawns forests of tabloid newsprint.</p> <p>Even before the first rumba of this latest series (number six) got under way, backstage rumblings were outing actress and celebrity contestant Cherie Lunghi as 'a trained dancer'. 'Foul', bleated the headlines. But, as sports presenter Gaby Logan knows to her cost, not everything is fair in the world of Strictly Come Dancing. Among the high and lows since the programme first aired in 2004, it was the voting off by the public of Logan, a talented former international gymnast on 4/1 odds of winning, that rocked the judges.</p> <p>The fact that GMTV presenter Kate Garraway, hobbling with tendonitis on 'two left feet', and Logan's rugby star husband Kenny, who performed with 'the grace of a vacuum cleaner', survived the public vote spoke volumes. No talent contest, this. Rather a brutal, bruising, popularity poll. </p> <p>But 'Strictly' really thrives on sexual chemistry and the whiff of scandal. Though conceived as a one-off, the headlines generated by the dancing partnership of erstwhile Kiwi builder Brendan Cole and former BBC newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky, left, guaranteed a second series. Cole was dumped by fianc\u00e9e and fellow contestant Camilla Dallerup amid intense speculation over the exact nature of his relationship with Kaplinsky. Her subsequent split with long-term boyfriend Mike Barnard, whom she met at Oxford, only fuelled gossip. Now married to investment banker Justin Bower and expecting her first child, she has always denied an affair with Cole.</p> <p>An equally smouldering combination between former EastEnders actor Matt di Angelo and professional partner Flavia Cacace produced not only risqu\u00e9 dance moves but also more publicity as Flavia ditched long-term partner and fellow contestant Vincent Simone.</p> <p>Romance definitely developed between Blue Peter's Gethin Jones and Welsh opera diva Katherine Jenkins after she performed 'Time to Say Goodbye' on the show.

  "<p>Cooking steak is a joy because it is a terrific piece of meat that has great flavour whether it is grilled or pan-fried. I suggest you pan-fry the more delicate cuts such as fillet and maybe a young sirloin, and grill the bigger, tastier, fattier ones like the rump, rib or anything on a bone.</p> <p><strong>Pan-frying</strong></p> <p>You want to use a solid pan that will hold the heat well, <br>nothing flimsy. A black cast-iron pan is perfect. Always heat the pan for a long time, and if your steak is really thick, heat the oven to 200\u00b0C/Gas 6 a good 15 minutes before you start to cook it. Rub the steak with ample oil - vegetable oil, nothing stronger as the steak tastes great itself. </p> <p>Season with salt and pepper after it is covered with oil, otherwise the salt will start to eat into the meat and dry it out. </p> <p>Open a window and a door to get fresh air because you are going to have lots of smoke. Drop the steak into the pan when it is so hot it is hard to put your hand close to it. Do not touch the steak for 2 minutes. Then turn it over and, if it is not sizzling, add some more oil but keep that heat high. Sear for 2 minutes more and then turn again (unless you like your steak blue). If it is really thick, say 5-7.5cm, put the pan in the oven for around 4 minutes, depending on how you want it cooked. </p> <p>Take the steak out and leave it to rest for 5 minutes before you serve. Remember the steak will continue to cook while it is resting. </p> <p><strong>Griddle</strong></p> <p>Put a ridged cast-iron plate over a high heat for 10 minutes before you even think about cooking. Rub the steak with oil and season both sides with salt and pepper. Lay the steak on the griddle and leave for 2 minutes, then flip and do the same. Cook as long as you need then take the steak off and leave to rest. If the meat is really thick, put it in the oven while still on the griddle plate. </p> <p><strong>Grilling over coals</strong></p> <p>Follow the same principles as a griddle plate but keep an eye out for yellow flames. This means the fat has caught fire, so move the steak to a different part of the grill.</p> <h2>Sauces</h2> <p><strong>Ceps Bordelaise sauce</strong><br>2 tbsp vegetable oil <br>50g butter<br>2 large shallots<br>diced 1 garlic clove, crushed to paste <br>400g ceps<br>200ml good red wine <br>1 thumb-sized piece of bone marrow (optional)<br>2 handfuls chopped parsley </p> <p>Heat a large pan and add the oil and the butter.

Slice the mushrooms about the thickness of your little finger and drop them in with the shallots. Stir, shake and cook for 5 minutes until it all smells delicious. Add the wine, and the bone marrow (if using).

Slice the onion into rounds about 1cm thick and place in a large heatproof bowl. Pour the boiling water over the onion rings and give them a good stir. Drain and pat them dry. Dust all the onion rings with the extra cornflour and dip them in the batter. Carefully drop the onion rings in the oil one at a time but do it quickly - you want about 10 per batch.

  "<p>When the Declaration of Human Rights was made, Tom Stoppard was 11 years old and living in Nottingham. In his short life he already had good reason to be sharply aware of its ideals. Having escaped from Czechoslovakia in 1939 - many of his Jewish relatives did not get out - the day the Nazis invaded, his family had lived as refugees for three years in Singapore. When the Japanese invasion forced them to move on again his mother took her two boys - Tom and his elder brother, Peter - to India; their father remained behind as a volunteer in the British army and died in a Japanese prison camp. </p> <p>Sitting opposite Stoppard in his flat in Chelsea Harbour, looking upriver, all these years on, it is hard to imagine him as that fatherless five-year-old asylum-seeker, Thomas Straussler, in Darjeeling. Stoppard, with several lifetimes worth of brilliance behind him, is the epitome of English raffishness, warm-hearted and courteous, offering sandwiches and tea, dragging on a cigarette as he thinks. He struggles a bit with the idea of the memory of his boyish self, too. </p> <p>'From my perspective, looking back, it was life going on. I wouldn't have known the word \"refugee\" when I was one, however I would have known that we had been bombed out of Singapore, and bombed on the ship, and we had lost our father. But that kind of uncertain situation went back further than my memory went back at the time. It was just my childhood.'</p> <p>That Stoppard was 'saved' in some respects from that uncertainty by the arrival in his life of a very British stepfather, an army major, has indelibly shaped his view of his adoptive country. By the time he arrived in Nottingham, with his new English name, he was already a champion of Britain's finer virtues. 'I was only eight. But when I came here America was the glamorous country and England was, in my mind, the country to do with the creation and spread of civilisation. In India we had not been Raj people until my mother remarried but after that I think I was turned into a proper little snob about the English.'</p> <p>Can he recall the previous sense of insecurity? Of always escaping things? </p> <p>'If I was trying to analsye myself as though I was someone else at that age,' he says, 'I would see someone who had completely pulled down the shutters.'</p> <p>Stoppard's writing, you could claim, has been a process of casting light on that formative shuttered-up experience in surprising ways. His plays from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead onwards have been preoccupied among many other things with individuals who, comically and tragically, have extremely limited control of their fate. Some more recent work has dwelt directly on the immigrant experience, particularly that of writers cast adrift. The genesis of the nine-hour trilogy The Coast of Utopia , for example, came from his wanting to examine the philosophies of two radical emigr\u00e9s from 19th-century Russia. He traces the history of that play now to a fascination with two quotations.</p> <p>The first, from Alexander Herzen, Russia's 'first socialist', was about a notion of Englishness that Stoppard himself had good reason to cherish and which he fears is now waning. Having come to Britain from Russia in 1852, Herzen had suggested that 'the English don't give asylum out of respect for us the asylum seekers, they give it out of respect for themselves, because they invented the idea of personal liberty'. </p> <p>The second quotation was from a celebrated critic, Vissarion Belinsky, who had been allowed out of Moscow at about the same time. In Paris, where he lived for a while in the 1850s, there was no censorship, but Belinsky was determined to go home. His friends tried to dissuade him. If he went back he would undoubtedly be arrested for his words, whereas in Paris he could publish anything. 'Belinsky's response was what made me want to write the play,' Stoppard says. 'He said something like \"At home everything I write had to be written so carefully - and when I had a piece coming out in the magazine Contemporary, students would buy a copy and eight of them would share it and stay up all night reading between its lines and get a sense that someone was talking to them about things that mattered. Whereas here in Paris you can write anything and none of it really means a bugger and nobody takes any notice of it. At home you understand what it means to be a writer.\" I was,' Stoppard says, 'tremendously struck by this paradox that under repression he could be himself...'</p> <p>Understanding what it means to be a writer, that paradox of being sometimes best able to fulfil that role in the harshest circumstances, has been at the heart of much of Stoppard's intellectual engagement. He has been a great champion of free expression, not only in his efforts to publicise and argue against the censorship and oppression of writers in the former Czechoslovakia and Russia and elsewhere, but also in his work. No living playwright delivers all the possibilities of 'play' in the way Stoppard consistently does. He is the natural playwright in conversation too, always looking for the other man's point of view, turning everything on its head.</p> <p>When I had first discussed the idea of talking about human rights with him, in a phone call, he suggested he was better at chatting than being interviewed, 'so would four hours be long enough?' I imagined it might.</p> <p>It is, in the event, a typical improvised performance, only slightly shorter than advertised. He begins with attempts at definitions and then immediately offers caveats. 'The thing about talking about human rights is that when one bears in mind the sharp end of it one does not want to worry too much about semantics. It's like that Hemingway story about two boxers. The one says of the other: \"Jack is a very intelligent fighter; you are aware when you are fighting him that he is thinking all the time. But then I won the fight because all the time he was thinking I was hitting him.\" That's it: People are being hit while we are talking, while we are thinking.' He then continues to talk, to think.</p> <p>Partly because of his background Stoppard was always acutely aware that in taking on some of these issues, he is, first, a writer in a comfortable country. They could never mean as much to him as they did to those who faced them daily. He could always get on British Airways and fly home. If he has sometimes appeared to be laissez faire about British politics, conservative even, it is because his animus has been directed toward other places, to the situation of other writers. The year 1977 was a sharp point in his life and his thinking and it was all about people who lived where he had started out.</p> <p>His fuel for getting involved with Czech writers and actors, and with his friend Vaclav Havel in particular, came from a deeply felt conviction that none of the freedoms is possible without freedom of human expression; Stoppard's plays had always been working definitions of that fact, in Prague, suddenly, he could see the drama unfolding in reality. That drama began with the publication by Czech dissidents of Charter 77, which was prompted by the arrest of the rock band the Plastic People of the Universe, and involved a charge sheet delivered to the government documenting its failure to adhere to the human-rights covenants it had signed.</p> <p>Stoppard spent a lot of the Seventies standing outside embassies with placards and writing letters, but going to see Havel for the first time was a watershed. He had learned about Havel's work from Ken Tynan in the mid-Sixties. 'I don't remember it as something that was all about human rights as a foreground fact,' he recalls. 'He was a playwright, he was banned, he was under house arrest. I had, earlier in 1977, also been to Moscow with a guy from Amnesty to talk about Russian Jews seeking exit visas and held in lunatic asylums. And after that I wrote two plays, one was about the Russian dissident situation, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, with Andr\u00e9 Previn. And I wrote a play about the situation in Czechoslovakia, Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth.'</p> <p>Stoppard, with his inbuilt Czech sense of the absurd, and his inspired understanding of Shakespeare, shared a sense of how theatre - being made fun of - might be the thing an authoritarian regime was most afraid of. Alongside these absurdist dramas, with brilliant pieces of reporting in the New York Review of Books and elsewhere, and the translation of Havel's plays, Stoppard became a standard bearer in the West for the Charter 77 movement that began to undermine the Communist regime in Prague, and across central Europe, and ultimately ended in the Velvet Revolution and the installation of Havel as President. </p> <p>He is at pains to point out, however, that in all of this real-life drama the abstract notion of human rights was secondary in a way. 'One didn't need a public phrase to tell one that certain kinds of behaviour towards Czech or Russian citizens was morally wrong. For me human rights simply endorse a view of life and a set of moral values that are perfectly clear to an eight-year-old child. A child knows what is fair and isn't fair, and justice derives from that knowledge.' Particularly, you might say, a child who had Stoppard's childhood.</p> <p>Stoppard is above all interested in following arguments, but he never rests at conclusions. Talk of human rights takes him towards more fundamental beliefs about the nature of what it means to be human. The logician in him wants to see human rights either as being necessarily God-given, absolutes, or alternatively simply man-made, civil rules. They cannot be both and he flits between these two possibilities. Despite everything he reads in Amnesty reports, or just 'in the fucking Guardian every morning', he clings to a sense of innate human goodness.</p> <p>'A friend,' he says, 'a writer, once suggested one of those phrases I had tried to formulate for myself all of my life. It is that our human survival depends on \"a contest of generosity\". You know yourself that this instinct is undoubtedly true on the microcosmic scale of the family. Obviously, you would give your life for your children, or give them the last biscuit on the plate. But to me the trick in life is to take that sense of generosity between kin, make it apply to the extended family and to your neighbour, your village and beyond.' Being Stoppard, he is alive to the fact that the language itself wants to make this point: 'kind' comes from 'kin'; kindness insists at root that you behave to others as you would to your family.</p> <p>We talk a little about the possibilities of kindness, about whether they can be applied as a universal philosophy. The Declaration of Human Rights grew out of the worst abuse of them in history, but, to take current events, should we believe human rights can be imposed by force?</p> <p>'Well,' he says, 'you read the accounts of people being tortured in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It is quite a hard thing to say without appearing to reach for Gandhi's dhoti, but I am convinced that if we, the great western liberal axis, simply refused to torture under any circumstances - even when we knew it might produce some information that would save thousands of lives - and by doing so we declared ourselves to be certain kinds of people, I am absolutely convinced that we would be making real headway in the war against terror.'</p> <p>I wonder if he feels that the right of free expression should extend in all cases to the right to offend? Where would he have stood on the publication of the Danish cartoons of the Prophet, for example?</p> <p>He pauses. 'If I had been a national newspaper editor no doubt I would have been scared to publish them, too. The ideal response would have been for the cartoons to have been republished in every newspaper in the western world along with reasoned rejoinders to why they should not be published. But when push comes to shove, I couldn't possibly castigate someone for not putting his staff in danger, or his family for that matter.' </p> <p>But don't human rights have to go beyond cultural difference in every case?</p> <p>He agrees. 'But that question is a leftover from an arena that no longer exists. The common ground of reason, that words have an integrity and they don't kill, has been replaced by a more surreal arena. When you think of honour killings, or clitoridectomy, how do we begin to engage with that at all?'</p> <p>One of the ways, perhaps, is through theatre, the example of Prague is perhaps the greatest expression of this. But does he believe dictatorships are always bound to fall, without foreign intervention?</p> <p>'One's gut feeling is yes. Let's say, given its history and geography, Czechosolvakia's history would always have evolved in some way. As it turned out it was like a fairytale. We never contemplated charging in to free the poor Poles and Estonians from their absence of free expression, because however dimly we had a sense that worse would follow...'</p> <p>Stoppard has lived long enough to know that fairytale endings seldom last. In his recent dramatisation of the home-made cultural forces that caused Czech communism to crumble, Rock'n'Roll - in part a homage to the Plastic People of the Universe - he ended in 1990, when everything was still to play for. He had, he says, originally planned it to end up in 1997 with a scene that showed how the freedom that everybody had dreamed about, the western way of life, wasn't entirely good news. But then his romanticism took over. He says he is happy to be thought of as a romantic, as sentimental even. That admission reminds me of the poignant theme in Jumpers in which Dotty, the former nightclub singer, goes mad with the thought that with man having landed on the moon all the mystery has gone from the universe. It always felt to me that that was Stoppard talking directly. Was it?</p> <p>He smiles. 'I think I have got over it. But at the time it seemed an immense change. It was as though up to that point the moon and the stars existed as an adornment for us. So it was a pretty sharp reminder of our true status alone in the universe...'</p> <p>As we have been talking he has spoken a little about human rights, or the basis of what being human is, as something that goes beyond the material. Does he have that faith? He pauses again. 'There is a level at which one can only give voice to some form of unreasoned conviction - and mine in that regard is that unless there is, for want of a better term, a spiritual universe, I don't see what is so important about anything including human rights. What I really think is that everybody who believes in human rights is unspokenly, possibly unconsciously, accepting some form of immaterial reality. I don't see the value in endurance or survival if we are no more than the sum of our molecules.'</p> <p>If he takes the implications of that phrase of Hamlet's, 'What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties... and yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?' which side does he come down on?</p> <p>'I don't believe that we evolved moral psychology, it just doesn't seem plausible to me as a biological phenomenon. About 40 years ago I said I just didn't find it credible that some green slime grew up to write Shakespeare's sonnets. And I don't,' he suggests, taking the longest drag on his cigarette and stubbing it out, 'find that idea any more plausible today.' </p> <p>Tom Stoppard's version of Chekhov's Ivanov is reviewed on page 19</p> <h2>The life of Stoppard</h2> <p><strong>1937 </strong>Tom\u00e1s Straussler is born on 3 July in Zlin, Czechoslovakia.</p> <p><strong>1949 </strong>Having fled to Singapore in 1939 to escape the Nazis, Japanese invasion compels his family to move to India and then England.</p> <p><strong>1954</strong> Leaves school at 17 to work as a journalist in Bristol.

  "<h2>Marjorie Nshemere Ojule<br>32, Ugandan refugee, now a trustee of Women for Refugee Women in the UK</h2> <p><strong>'If my husband is out there, if he sees my photo, I would love him to contact me'</strong></p> <p>In Uganda I was active in opposition politics at a grassroots level: working in my village, helping women to know their rights and teaching them reading and writing. I was detained twice. The horror that I experienced in there, you wouldn't wish that on anyone, not even your enemy. I was tortured, I was raped, I was burnt with cigarettes, I was cut with razors, electric shocks: all the horrible things you can think of to get information from someone. Eventually I escaped and came to England. It was scary but I'd been in this torture for some time, and I just wanted to be able to breathe fresh air again. I left my husband when I escaped and that's the last time I saw him. I don't have a clue where he is. If he's out there, if he sees my photo, I would love him to contact me. I may be dreaming about him when he's already dead but life is full of surprises. </p> <p>The child I have now is out of rape and at first I didn't want to keep her, I wanted to put her up for adoption. When I arrived in 2002, they took me to the hospital: I was malnourished, I was dehydrated, I didn't have any blood and the Home Office told me I had to go home when the child was born. After six months they wanted to check my daughter was healthy and it was only after that they said 'Oh by the way we have a family for her'. I said I'm not ready to give someone my child if they first want to see if she's developing at the normal rate and so on. At this time I was going to counselling and it made me a strong person: my wounds had healed, I was looking and feeling myself and I realised this child was part of me. It's difficult bringing her up but if I didn't have her I would have gone insane waiting for a decision from the Home Office. </p> <p>It's easy to say 'Oh asylum seekers have taken all the houses and so on', but the truth is that asylum seekers really suffer in the current system. When my case was heard in court, the judge agreed that I was tortured and gave me leave to remain on human-rights grounds. But the Home Office appealed against that decision. That was in 2004 and, until January this year, I was living in limbo, waiting to hear the outcome. Finally they gave me indefinite leave to remain.</p> <p>I got tired of sitting at home so I started looking for charities and it was through Women for Refugee Women that I met Natasha [Walter, who runs the charity]. I've been public speaking ever since, telling my story and telling the stories of other women who can't speak English. It felt like therapy as well: when there's a place where you can explode with anger and say 'why would the government do this?' it feels good afterwards, like I could breathe properly. Everyone asks me 'Oh my God Marjorie, how did you manage to deal with all these things?' I'd say the work I do with you keeps me busy. I've been to the House of Commons I don't know how many times. The first time was so scary but when I stood up and spoke, I looked around and everyone was nodding and I thought: oh my God, I have power. You can make me sign [for asylum seekers' financial support] 1,001 times a day [asylum seekers have to sign regularly to comply with Home Office regulations. Breach of signing requirements can result in detention] but you can't take my brains out of my head. I thought 'Way to go, woman!' Natasha tells me I'm amazing and I say 'I'm amazing because of you'. That makes me cry because if it wasn't for people like that I could not have had that power. I am so grateful to them. </p> <p>I'm putting in an application for my 10-year-old daughter to come here because my mother, her guardian, passed away. Looking forward to meeting her - that hope keeps me going. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.refugeewomen.com\">refugeewomen.com</a></p> <h2>Hollman Morris<br>40, Colombian journalist, winner of the 2007 human rights watch defender prize</h2> <p><strong>'I had to find out how people were slaughtered and nothing happened'</strong></p> <p>My seven-year-old daughter asked me a while ago 'Daddy, why do you only interview sad people?' She had just seen one of my shows where I talked to victims of Colombia's conflict but I explained to her they are not just sad, they also have dreams, hope and dignity...</p> <p>The people I interview are the voice of the 'other' Colombia, a Colombia that you don't see in most media, a Colombia that some people wish didn't exist. I knew from when I set out to be a journalist that my job was to show their stories. </p> <p>I first saw that need when I was a teenager watching the TV news and when they reported about a massacre in Segovia where 70 people were killed in one day (11 November 1988) and I thought 'Shit, what is that about?' and then a few hours later we were watching a national beauty contest. That defined my role as a journalist because I decided I had to find out how it could be in this country that people were being slaughtered and nothing happened. </p> <p>That has always meant problems for me with all the armed actors in the Colombian conflict. Since 1997 there have always been death threats from one group or another. But the most critical year of my life was between 2000 and 2001. A colleague who had been kidnapped and raped (by paramilitaries) said her captors had told her: 'Hollman Morris is next.' Around the same time my wife Patty told me she was pregnant. We fled to Spain with the help of an Amnesty International programme for human rights defenders because I was able to show my work from a human rights perspective.</p> <p>After a year we came back to Colombia. My options for work in Spain were to do menial tasks, be a parking lot attendant. So it was a choice between shooting myself [out of frustration] in Spain or I get shot doing what I love in Colombia. </p> <p>Our job as journalists is to look after people's rights. In a way we are the guardians of human rights. We may not be the activists who put out urgent action notices every day. But our work as journalists is to write, publish and denounce when there is a violation of any fundamental right. </p> <p>My generation has never seen a day of peace in Colombia. What I want is through journalism to try to build a better country for my children to live in so that they can live in peace.</p> <h2>Zmitser Dashkevich<br>27, leader of Youth Front, Belarus</h2> <p><strong>'I received hundreds of letters of support every day from all over the world'</strong></p> <p>I was arrested in September 2006 and charged with 'organising and participating in the activity of an unregistered non-governmental organisation'. After six weeks in detention and on trial I was sentenced to one-and-a-half years in prison.</p> <p>At that time I was leader of Youth Front, which is a Christian organisation of young people in Belarus. It is an independent political and social force which is in stark opposition to President Alexander Lukashenko, the last dictator in Europe. Lukashenko has openly praised Stalin and wants to turn our country back into the evil empire, the Soviet Union. We believe his politics are leading to the spiritual and moral degeneration of Belarussian society.</p> <p>On six occasions we have tried to register our organisation but every time our application was refused. In early 2006 Lukashenko became very worried in the run-up to presidential elections. He understood that he was losing his power because the younger generation - despite all the ideology and repression - did not support him. Young people are mostly pro-European and pro-democratic in outlook. We were holding protests against falsification of the vote. So he introduced a new article into the law making it illegal to participate in the activities of an unregistered organisation. I was the first to be prosecuted. </p> <p>After sentencing I was sent to prison. We slept in barracks and ate porridge and rotten meat. Very soon I started receiving hundreds of letters of support every day. They came from ordinary Belarussians, from Christian organisations and from members of human-rights groups from all over the world. These activists also sent thousands of letters to the government. And they sent lots of origami cranes - a symbol of freedom. I received some in prison. The censors checked my post and they unfolded the cranes to see if anything was inside. So I just received these creased, flattened-out pieces of coloured paper. But it was a powerful statement. </p> <p>The government had painted us oppositionists as a sad, marginal group on the payroll of the CIA. But when the prison guards saw all my letters, they said: 'Wow, the people are really behind this guy.' They started to understand the gap between the propaganda and reality. Even the administrators admitted the letters were proof of something big. It altered their outlook. As a direct result of the huge campaign of public solidarity I was released one-and-a-half months early and returned to lead Youth Front. We are still struggling against Lukashenko's regime but now they are too afraid to imprison people under the registration law. </p> <h2>Odette Mupenzi<br>31, victim of Rwandan genocide </h2> <p><strong>'I was very ill... I wanted to commit suicide. Now, I feel alive again'</strong></p> <p>I realised being a Tutsi was not considered good by some people when I was 11, because I had a teacher who picked on us, saying we had funny faces. Then in 1990 [the majority Hutus] killed many Tutsi intellectuals in a stadium near where I lived. After that, I knew we were in danger, but I didn't expect what was coming.</p> <p>In January 1994, my family stopped sleeping at home because we thought we would be taken away during the night. When the genocide began in April, we fled to a religious seminary. The next day, lots of people turned up with machetes, guns, spears and axes. </p> <p>Many of us hid in a classroom. They came to the door and my father opened it, because they threatened to burn the building down. When he did, I saw them cut him open. I was hiding under a mattress and they put a gun to my face and shot me. I could hear people praying, then there was silence - everyone was dead. The next thing I remember was waking up in hospital.</p> <p>I've been fighting for life ever since. In Rwanda, all they did was wash the wound. An NGO helped me get treatment in Switzerland, but they ran out of money. I went to Germany and the same thing happened.</p> <p>I first met the human-rights group Aegis Trust when it set up a genocide memorial in Kigali [in 2004]. I was very ill at the time - my bones were infected and I was living on morphine. </p> <p>In March 2006, I came to England. I've had metal bones put in my jaw, and skin taken from my side and put in my face. I don't think people at home would recognise me. I can eat with a spoon and fork and drink from a tap. I don't know how to explain how the trust has helped me - thank you isn't enough. When they met me, I wanted to commit suicide. Now, I feel alive again.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't want to go back to Rwanda. The war has stopped, but there are still troubles - survivors have been killed to stop them testifying against people. I just want to live in a country where I don't have to look over my shoulder all the time. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aegistrust.org\">aegistrust.org</a></p> <h2>Ignatius Mahendra Kusuma Wardhana<br>25, Indonesian student activist </h2> <p><strong>'They put me in a cell.

In January 2003, the President brought in a new policy to increase fuel and electricity prices, so mass demonstrations took place across Indonesia. We held a demonstration in Jakarta and it ended with a performance in which we burnt pictures of the President and Vice President. The police surrounded us and one of my friends was captured. I was not arrested at this point because the police didn't have a warrant. But my friend was blindfolded and they threatened him, saying they would shoot him and throw his body in the sea. He told me all this afterwards - at the time we didn't realise that he was captured. </p> <p>When we went to the police station to find him, they gave me the warrant and arrested me. They interrogated me for about seven hours and a lot of the questions were not about the demonstration but about my organisation, who I was dealing with and so on. They put me in a cell that they called 'the tiger cage' because there was no bathroom in there; it's like when you're in the zoo and you see animals in a cage. It's a place where the police beat up prisoners too so there were a lot of blood prints over the walls. </p> <p>In every trial the President's supporter came and threatened me and my lawyer. Maybe my lawyer was not brave enough because at the sixth or seventh trial he backed down and gave up. I was in despair because I thought I had no other way out. In April 2003 I was sentenced to three years. I was put in a cell they called the dry cell because there is no water at all - they gave us a drink once a day. There was a prisoner who sort of ran the prison, a member of the President's party, who fought me every week. Well, it wasn't really a fight because they were about 20 people and I am only one. The prison officer knew what was going on but I guess he was given money.</p> <p>Amnesty International is familiar with the Indonesian movement and it made a greeting-card campaign, sending cards to me and to the Indonesian President. I counted more than 4,000 letters. They made me feel better and gave me hope but, most important, they meant that the prison officer was more careful with me. I was there for two years, seven months and three days: I counted every day but the most significant factor in keeping my spirits up was the campaign. When I got letters from children in the UK I just couldn't believe that they were aware of me and were doing something about it. </p> <p>Indonesia is in a transitional period right now and there is still a lot to do for human rights. The first thing I did when I was released was demonstrate outside the prison because even though we got a new President with the 2004 election, he has continued repressive policies against activists. Prison is a bad memory but I got a lot of experience and lessons from it. I'm going to study human rights and politics at York University in October and after that I will continue my organisation. This is what I live for, this struggle.</p>",
  "<p>I am, at heart, a person who feels happiest in a city. I like street lamps, taxis and the reassuring strains of drunks and traffic at 3am. In the countryside I'm always a little apprehensive about the endless possibilities for bother - animals off the leash, the sudden plunge into thick, boggy darkness, the lack of an underground system. </p> <p>Over the years friends have periodically announced plans for camping in the countryside. This I have always considered to be beyond the pale; more an endurance test than anything that could be said to pass for a holiday. </p> <p>I once camped in St Ives years ago - I lasted a solitary sleepless night and then checked in to a B&amp;B. Quite a leap then, perhaps, to go on a walking holiday in the Sahara Desert with porterage by camels and shelter under canvas. In my forties I have decided, though, that I should just do stuff when the opportunity presents. Get out there and take a chance... Lawrence of Arabia is one of my favourite films and certainly the desert seems to be a place a person should visit during a well-lived lifetime. In the lead-up to the trip I bury random concerns under a series of sensible talks to myself. I will be sharing a tent with an old friend, Stuart, who, over the years, has borne my bleatings with equanimity. I want to see Tunisia. The trip is top and tailed with stays in what looks like a lovely hotel and it is only five nights under the stars, weeing in the sand and washing with wet wipes. How bad can it be? </p> <p>We begin our trip in Jerba, an island in the south of Tunisia not far from the Libyan border and linked to the mainland by a Roman causeway. Our hotel is as pretty and comfortable as promised, but, sadly, we aren't there for very long. Delays to our flight mean our group of six checks in at 2.50am and by 9am we are on our way to the edge of the desert with our guide, Mohamed. </p> <p>Douz is an oasis where the road runs out, tour buses pull over and there is not much to see but sand - mile upon mile of dunes. </p> <p>We arrive late in the afternoon and Mohamed is worried about the weather. Will there be a sand storm? If so, he recommends waiting until the next day to start walking, when better conditions are promised. I am euphoric (an extra night in a proper bed, oh joy), the rest of our hardy party less so. After intense discussion weighing up pros and cons, assessing wind direction, Mohamed decides we will hit the road after all. I am distraught but try not to show it. It turns out to be an odd and unnerving thing - just striking out in to the middle of nowhere for what now seems no very good reason. As we hit our stride I feel less discombobulated and tune in to the talk, which is of camels - they rule in this part of the world and owning them indicates wealth and status. The white ones are the most expensive (as much as 2,000 dinars or \u00a3890) and throughout our trip I mostly keep a good distance from the three who are travelling with us. The guides handle them carefully and with respect. Nobody pets them. </p> <p>The first evening establishes the routine for all five nights in the desert; we find somewhere suitable to camp and the guides unload the camels and distribute luggage. A thick blanket goes on the floor of a two-man tent (the tents pop up instantly, which, to me at least, was a revelation). Then a mat each for Stuart and I to sleep on, on top of which goes a serious sleeping bag, then another heavy blanket. As soon as the sun goes down (about 7.30pm), it is instantly freezing and we change into thermals, plus pyjamas, a tight fleece, then a loose fleece, an alpaca hat, thick socks and trainers. </p> <p>Supper is around a campfire and the food throughout is plain but good and hearty - typically, of an evening, soup followed by lamb or vegetables and couscous, with dates after and always finished off with warm sweet 'te, te, te!', as one of the camel drivers routinely announces it. There are three camel drivers - two are related; an uncle and his nephew who own two of the camels. The cook doesn't own a camel and has a long mournful Modigliani face and a bad back, for which I supply him with Nurofen. After supper, we retire to our tents and Stuart reads to me by torchlight - Paul Bowles short stories of macabre and terrifying goings-on in the North African desert, possibly not very sensibly. From the first night, though, I feel surprisingly comfortable and at ease in our gritty surroundings (there is sand everywhere obviously and I still, even now, find grains in socks and hems and suitcase corners). Even when I wake at 3am I just sit and stare, awestruck, at the stars. As the days progress I realise, tentatively at first, that I am enjoying myself and my new surroundings. </p> <p>Admittedly, the mornings are a bit cold and miserable before the sun comes up around 8am. Breakfast isn't quite ready and, after packing up, all you can do is shiver in the half light longing for some sun and for the flat Arabic bread cooking over ashes, served with fig jam and Dairylea-style sliced cheese, and mugs of strong coffee, to be served. But there is something glorious about sitting watching the sun rise before your eyes. </p> <p>Thereafter the days are hot and, for long stretches while we walk, there is no shade, so we all wear traditional head wraps as advised by Mohamed - they may make you sweaty, but it saves your sanity. All four walking days involve three hours at a smartish pace in the morning, followed by two hours for lunch at the hottest time of day, then two hours more walking in the afternoon. We walk about 100km in all, from Douz to Ksar Ghilane, on sand that goes from palest yellow to deepest orange. </p> <p>Highlights include clambering up and down sand dunes in bare feet, eating and sometimes sleeping outside and that first slice of sun every morning. Mostly, though, there is just something very satisfying about starting out at oasis A and walking into oasis B five days later, having trekked across deserted country with only as much as the camels can carry and safe in the knowledge that sooner or later this will all be over and you can have... a shower!</p> <h2> Essentials</h2> <p>Exodus (0845 863 9600; <a href=\"http://www.exodus.co.uk\">exodus.co.uk</a>) runs eight-day trips to Tunisia, including a five-night desert trek through the Sahara with the first and last nights in Djerba, from \u00a3808pp including flights, accommodation, all meals and the services of a guide.

  "<p>Eight members of the cabinet joining the dole queue. The number of Labour MPs reduced to a shattered rump of just 160. David Cameron strolling into power with a crushing landslide. That is the apocalyptic scenario facing Labour as the party gathers for its conference in Manchester. </p> <p>We knew before this weekend that Labour was in desperate trouble. What we know now, and in forensic detail, is that the party is stumbling towards a massacre.</p> <p>Conventional opinion polls measure the national share of the vote, but translating that into what it would mean at a general election relies on the use of crude swingometers and the uncertain assumption that the same swing would occur across the country in very different types of seats and contests.</p> <p>Using a huge sample of more than 34,000 people in 238 marginal constituencies, the poll for <a href=\"http://www.PoliticsHome.com\">PoliticsHome.com</a> is the largest representative survey of its kind ever conducted in Britain. It provides a definitive picture of public opinion in the key seats that will decide the next election. The findings could not be more devastating for the Labour MPs who will be spending this morning checking the data to see which of them are going to lose their seats.</p> <p>Cameron is projected to walk into Number 10 with a steamroller majority of 146. In the new House of Commons, the Conservatives would have 398 seats, the sort of dominance they used to enjoy when Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp. There would only be a rump Labour party left to oppose him. The number of Labour MPs would be slashed by more than half to 160, a band smaller than after the 'suicide note' election of 1983 when Labour was led by Michael Foot. The Liberal Democrats would lose slightly less than a third of their representation in the Commons and end up with 44 seats. </p> <p>After the most humiliating rout, Labour is pushed back to its hardcore redoubts in South Yorkshire, the north-east, the Welsh valleys and deprived inner-city seats. All the gains of the Blair years are wiped out and worse. In southern England outside London, Labour is left clinging to one seat: Bristol South is a lonely island of red in an ocean of blue. It is as if New Labour had never happened. Just as during its bleakest years in the Eighties, Labour is driven out of Middle England. </p> <p>There would be a cull of the cabinet. Senior ministers, like other Labour MPs, have tried to console themselves with the thought that they might somehow defy the national swing against their party. This poll, by sampling opinion in their own seats, destroys that consolation. A third of the cabinet would be handed P45s by the electorate. Big-name casualties include the Justice Secretary Jack Straw in Blackburn and the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith in her West Midlands seat of Redditch. Gone too is the Chief Whip, Geoff Hoon. Blairite casualties of the slaughter are James Purnell, the Work and Pensions Secretary, and John Hutton, the Business Secretary. Defence Secretary Des Browne, Universities Secretary John Denham and Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly would all be looking for new jobs. </p> <p>The poll indicates that the Conservative surge is at its strongest in the Midlands, a region packed with election-deciding marginals. The Tories can expect a major revival in Wales. The view that the Conservatives are doing poorly in northern England is shown to be misleading. While the swing to the Tories is not so powerful in Yorkshire and Cumbria, the Conservatives are now performing strongly across the rest of the North, robbing Labour MPs of another consolation.</p> <p>Scotland is the exception: there the Tories are making almost no progress in key marginals. The big winners north of the border are Alex Salmond's Nationalists. They win all nine of the target seats polled and would gain a further eight if the swing were repeated in other Labour constituencies. That includes a predicted SNP win over Labour in Glenrothes, where a looming by-election is regarded as crucial to Gordon Brown's survival prospects. </p> <p>London is also swinging to the Tories, though less powerfully than other parts of the country. The capital also provides one small morsel of gladdening news for Labour. Support for Respect appears to have collapsed, and the poll suggests that Labour will regain Bethnal Green and Bow.</p> <p>There may be some cause for concern for the Conservatives that few voters can name their Tory candidate. Fewer than a tenth of respondents in Corby know that novelist Louise Bagshawe is the Tory standard bearer. Zac Goldsmith is better known in Richmond Park - the south-west London seat which he is projected to win from the Lib Dems - but even then less than half of voters can name him as the Tory candidate. </p> <p>For Nick Clegg and his party, the outlook is sweet and sour. This monster poll of marginals indicates that Lib Dems may buck the national trend when their MPs are defending seats from attack by the other parties. That's partly because Lib Dem MPs are so assiduous at digging in and nurturing a high personal vote. Lib Dem MPs tend to outperform MPs of other parties when voters are asked to rate their representative for being local, approachable, independent and in touch.</p> <p>This incumbency factor, combined with tactical voting, helps to save a number of Lib Dem seats. But that won't be enough to spare all of them from the scything swing to the Tories. Their most high-profile casualty is projected to be Chris Huhne, the past leadership contender and their home affairs spokesman, who is projected to lose his Eastleigh seat. </p> <p>The depressing finding for the Lib Dems is that there is little evidence of any success for their strategy of targeting Labour seats in the hope that this could offset losses to the Tories. Polling in these marginals finds that the drop in Labour support is benefiting the Conservatives far more than it is the Lib Dems. In some cases this even means the Tories can win from a third place at the last election.</p> <p>The poll tells us why Labour is so abjectly unpopular in the crucial marginals. Asked to name the issues that are most important to them, the voters in these seats put the economy first, closely followed by law and order. Crime and the economy are top of the agenda in every group of marginal seats and across all of the parties' swing voters. Then comes health, education, immigration, tax and inflation. Immigration is a big issue for voters in the most urban of the marginal seats such as those in London, Birmingham or West Yorkshire, but registers little in the south-west or Scotland. </p> <p>With the exception of education (where they are neck-and-neck), and health, which is still a 'Labour issue', all the issues that voters regard as most important are those on which the Tories lead Labour. Voters prefer Tory policies to the Labour alternative by a margin of almost two to one. What is true of the policies is magnified when it comes to how voters regard the rival personalities. David Cameron is preferred as best Prime Minister by more than twice as many people as those who choose Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Even among voters still prepared to support Labour, many do not have confidence in the Prime Minister. Only 61 per cent of Labour voters say Brown is the best person to be Prime Minister. By contrast, 86 per cent of Tory voters name Cameron. Just 28 per cent of Lib Dem voters, and only 8 per cent of voters as a whole, think that Nick Clegg would be the best Prime Minister, indicating that the Lib Dem leader has a lot of work to do to build his credibility. </p> <p>The other parties like to comfort themselves with the thought that support for Cameron is shallow and flaky; this poll suggests they are fooling themselves. Not only do the Tories have a massive lead in marginal seats, their vote is also the most robust. Half of their supporters say there is no chance at all of them changing their minds, and a further 36 per cent say it is unlikely they will switch.</p> <p>In comparison, more than a fifth (22 per cent) of Labour's remaining supporters say it is likely or possible that they will switch their support to another party. Dire as it is for Labour, things could get even worse.</p> <p>The poll does hold out the possibility for Labour recovery, but it is not a scenario that will appeal to Brown. He is a huge negative for Labour among marginal voters, especially those who might switch their vote. One of the most resonant messages among the potential switchers is 'Gordon Brown is the wrong man to lead the country'. Take that away and the Conservatives could lose support to Labour. Approaching half (44 per cent) of potential Tory/Labour switchers say they would be more likely to vote Labour if Gordon Brown were replaced as Prime Minister.</p> <p>That should concentrate some minds in Manchester, especially among the cabinet.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Andrew Rawnsley is editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http://www.PoliticsHome.com\">PoliticsHome.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Beyond the small village of Gisagara in the Ndora district of southern Rwanda, the road dwindles to a dirt track. From here, it is just a few miles to the promontory at Mount Kabuye, along a route overhung by avocado and mango trees. It was this journey that Sylvestre Ntakirutinka, a retired agricultural officer, made with his 11-year-old son Emanuel in late April 1994, hoping it would save their lives.</p> <p>Two weeks after the beginning of the Rwandan genocide, with massacres of the Tutsi minority ethnic group taking place by the majority Hutus throughout the country, they and thousands of other Tutsis crammed into cars and buses to make the ascent to Kabuye, where they had been promised food and armed protection by local authorities.</p> <p>But by the time they arrived, smoke was already drifting from the surrounding hills, where Tutsi homes had been ransacked and torched. And as they watched police and the Interahamwe paramilitary death squads assemble on the surrounding hills with guns and machetes, it became clear they had been gathered not to ensure their safety but to hasten their killing.</p> <p>The shooting began that afternoon and continued, in sporadic bursts, for several days. When it finally subsided, the Interahamwe were sent in to finish the work. Emanuel survived, running from the hill as the killing began and eluding the militia stationed on the road to cut down Tutsis. But Sylvestre did not. Because of his professional connections, he was singled out by the authorities for a quick death and executed in front of his young son. When the massacre was complete his body was one of about 25,000 to be shovelled by bulldozers into mass graves.</p> <p>Fourteen years later, several miles from where a simple memorial marks the spot of the slaughter at Kabuye, Emanuel's brother, Sylvere Mudendeli, shows little sign of emotion when recounting the story of his father's death. Sipping a cup of ginger tea, he marks out the chronology of events with his finger on the tablecloth in front of him. His account is calm and precise. Of his immediate family of 14, only he and two of his brothers survived the events of 1994. 'You don't reflect too much for fear of it splitting your head,' he said. </p> <p>In 2003, Dominique Ntawukuriryayo, the former deputy governor of the Gisagara region, who is suspected of organising the massacre at Kabuye, was tracked to the French town of Carcassonne. There he had founded a children's welfare group which listed among its objectives 'helping children deprived of education by war, misery, extreme poverty, illness or the death of their parents'.</p> <p>Since then, Sylvere has worked tirelessly with a small French organisation, Collective of Plaintiffs for Rwanda, to piece together what took place at Mount Kabuye and build a case against the suspected perpetrators. He admits that for much of this time, it seemed a hopeless task. 'If you had seen what had happened during the genocide you would not imagine that justice could exist.' But on 20 February this year, a French court decided there was enough evidence to extradite Ntawukuriryayo to face charges of genocide, complicity in genocide and direct and public incitement to commit genocide. He was transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, on 5 June.</p> <p>Ntawukuriryayo has denied ever having been to Mount Kabuye and claims he was almost killed during the genocide for helping to save the lives of many Tutsis in his district. 'I contest in their entirety all the things I am accused of,' he said at his extradition hearing. 'My conscience is clear.' The trial is unlikely to begin for years.</p> <p>But Sylvere knows he is one of the lucky ones. Fourteen years after Rwanda's Hutus attempted to wipe out the Tutsis, leaving about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate members of their own kind dead, the chances of prosecution for genocide suspects living outside Rwanda remain minimal. </p> <p>'There are thousands of genocidaires living in EU countries, with large numbers in almost every European country including the UK,' said Rakiya Omaar, whose organisation, African Rights, has worked since the genocide to track them down. 'It's very difficult to put a figure on it since many of them have gone there under false names and identities. But the magnitude of the problem is overwhelming. A lot of these people are living in the suburbs, tending their gardens and going to church regularly. [Others] hold important positions. They have the confidence of being European citizens and feel no one will get at them.'</p> <p>Some are the foot soldiers of the Rwandan genocide, those directly involved in the killing who manned the roadblocks and hacked down their Tutsi neighbours with machetes and other farming tools. But many are high-priority suspects, those designated Category 1 by the Rwandan government: the businessmen, educators and politicians whose status and wealth qualified them to plan the slaughter and enabled them to escape its aftermath. New cases are being discovered frequently. Most of the suspects are in Belgium and France, absorbed quickly into the Rwandan communities there. In 2006, four suspected genocidaires, two of whom featured on the Rwandan prosecutor general's most-wanted list, were found living in Britain.</p> <p>One of them was Charles Munyaneza, the former mayor of the commune of Kinyamakara, who had gained refugee status in Britain having shortened his name to Muneza. He is accused of co-ordinating the slaughter with particular zeal, travelling throughout his area dressed in military uniform to urge on the death squads. More than a decade later, he was discovered living with his wife and four children in the nondescript Bedford suburb of Putnoe, donning tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt every day to go to work as a cleaner.</p> <p>All four suspects are awaiting a decision on their appeal against extradition to Rwanda. But Omaar thinks there are many more living in Britain. 'We believe this is only the tip of the iceberg and that the number of actual suspects is much higher,' she said. 'The UK, and other English-speaking countries in the West, are increasingly targeted by Rwandan genocide suspects for settlement. There are so many seeking asylum in Belgium and in France, so they think they should try new pastures. And they feel they should take advantage of being abroad to learn English and put their children into the English schools.'</p> <p>It was not supposed to be like this. After the genocide, there was an unprecedented outpouring of remorse from the international community about its failure to intervene in Rwanda. But in the years that followed, there was little evidence of a collective determination to track down and bring the perpetrators to account.</p> <p>Since it was set up in November 1994, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has completed 33 cases with 28 convictions. Some European countries, notably Belgium and Switzerland, have tried suspects on their own soil with a handful of convictions resulting. But the numbers of arrests, prosecutions and extraditions are trivial in comparison to the huge number of genocide suspects living freely in Europe.</p> <p>Since 1994, the most determined genocidaire hunters have been a handful of survivors, human-rights activists and small NGOs (charities and campaigns) with a strong personal investment in bringing them to justice.</p> <p>Omaar can still remember the moment she committed herself to this work. A London-based Somalian, she travelled to Rwanda in late April 1994 at the height of the genocide. 'The first massacre site I went to was the parish of Rukare in Kibungo. I was walking through this parish and I could see people's history strewn there, photo albums, driving licences, identity cards, letters, toothbrushes.</p> <p>'The pews in the churches were ripped as people were desperate to find something to fight with. The ceilings were torn where they [the killers] had been looking for people. And even in the room for premature babies - the incubators were riddled with bullets because people had been shooting at them. Everywhere around you could see the struggle for survival and the determination to eliminate a people.</p> <p>'The only thing I could do was promise that I would do everything I could to ensure the world knew what had happened to these people and that they were not forgotten. Many times I have found the burden of working on Rwanda to be too high a price to pay but I always go back to that promise.'</p> <p>Now based in offices off a dusty track in the Rwandan capital Kigali, African Rights has produced dozens of reports, some naming hundreds of perpetrators, which have often resulted in criminal tribunal indictments and arrests in Europe. The process of investigating the Rwandan massacres so many years later is, she admits, slow and arduous. Omaar and her colleagues return again and again to survivors to ask them to recount their stories, monitor the names coming from testimonies in domestic genocide trials and wait for patterns to emerge.</p> <p>'At the beginning you are just trying to see what keeps getting repeated as a signal that's a path we should pursue,' she said. 'When you have five or six or seven people saying, \"This person distributed guns to us and said these are to be used for such and such a massacre\", you pick up these threads and you follow them through.'</p> <p>Their methods for locating suspects are much the same. They keep their ears to the ground and wait for information to come in. In many cases, the tip-offs have come from Rwandan Tutsis who survived the genocide and moved to Europe years later, only to find themselves living alongside their former tormentors.</p> <p>These encounters have often been in the most mundane of circumstances: a chance meeting in the supermarket, a familiar face in the street. Leaning over his desk in the Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture, Janvier Gasasira still sounds incredulous when he describes how he got on the Brussels Metro one day in 2001 and came face to face with \u00c9tienne Nzabonimana, a Rwandan businessman who helped organise attacks in which Gasasira's entire family were murdered. 'I went up to him and I said, \"Hi!\"' he said. 'I was so confused, I had never expected to meet him again but I said to myself, \"I'll say hello to him in Kinyarwanda [the most widely spoken Rwandan language] and make sure if it's really him or not.\"'</p> <p>Nzabonimana's reaction was telling. 'He was very shaken up. He made out he didn't understand anything as if he was someone of another nationality. Then immediately afterwards, he got off.'</p> <p>Gasasira went straight to the Belgian police. Four years later, he testified against Nzabonimana in court in Brussels and saw him jailed for 12 years.</p> <p>'Testifying was a release for me and a duty for my family,' said Gasasira. 'If I had not done that I would have been a coward. I didn't do anything to merit staying alive [during the genocide] but I am alive and that may be a message that I can do something [to help].'</p> <p>His case is by no means exceptional. The Rwandan expat community is tightknit and survivors are often fully aware of where the genocidaires live. But in one crucial regard, he was fortunate; he found a justice system willing to prosecute Nzabonimana. Many other genocide survivors have found host countries less receptive.</p> <p>The pursuit of Dominique Ntawukuriryayo was beset with political hurdles. When the Collective of Plaintiffs for Rwanda first provided the French authorities with details of where he was living in Carcassonne, they were told there was no one of that name there. He would later be arrested at precisely that address. The collective has now lost so much faith in the French authorities that it routinely takes out civil cases against suspects it is pursuing, to ensure they will still be brought to court even if the extradition process fails. Britain has also been criticised for its slowness to act upon information about suspects on its soil. As the international community has dragged its feet over the issue, the fugitives have taken note.</p> <p>'The numbers are growing and growing,' said Omaar. 'Many of them are using citizenship and resident permits and the money they are earning in Europe to evacuate their own relatives who are also wanted for genocide in Rwanda. The failure [of authorities] to take action has been an encouragement. If timely action had been taken in these last few years to arrest, prosecute and extradite, it would have been a very strong symbol.'</p> <p>Fugitive genocidaires are also blamed for the creeping return to Rwanda of the ideology that underpinned the genocide. In April, the main Rwandan survivors' group, Ibuka, complained to the BBC and Voice of America that some of its programmes, broadcast in Kinyarwanda, had hosted suspected perpetrators who used their platform to deny the genocide.</p> <p>'It is incitement,' said Benoit Kaboyi, executive secretary of Ibuka. 'Those people from the outside are denying the genocide. They say we have exaggerated it.' </p> <p>Yet the biggest threat to Rwanda's future stability is not posed by historical revisionism. It is the signal that the continuing evasion of justice by fugitive genocidaires sends out.</p> <p>'We have a long history of impunity here - to the extent of being institutionalised,' said Rwandan prosecutor-general Martin Ngoga. 'We have got to a point where the country legislates in a way that promotes impunity and that's very dangerous. There should be a clear message sent out that you can't commit these kinds of crimes and go unpunished.'</p> <p>For the moment, that message remains obscured by a complex web of international diplomacy, legal procedures and difficulties caused by the sheer scale of the problem. But there are signs the situation is improving.</p> <p>The catalyst for this, in part, has been the decision to wind up the slow-moving and costly International Criminal Tribunal in Tanzania by the end of 2011. Host countries are beginning to realise that when that happens, they will either have to extradite suspects to Rwanda or deal with them themselves. Norway and Sweden have set up specialist war crimes units to address the problem of fugitive genocide suspects. The Netherlands, the UK, Finland, Belgium, New Zealand and the US are among the countries that have sent investigators to Rwanda to examine cases. More resources and investigators are now being made available, though these measures are still dwarfed by the scale of the problem. For Omaar, these developments are cause for cautious optimism. 'I wouldn't say there is massive political will, but there is more political will and interest than there was five or six years ago,' she said.</p> <p>But many survivors are sceptical as to whether the pattern of the past 14 years will change. One, who wishes only to be known as Marcel, 36, lost his entire family in a massacre at the parish of Mugina. Though he survived, the scars on his back and stomach where he was repeatedly slashed with a machete, and wounds to his head which cause him headaches and occasional epileptic seizures, are an enduring testament to his experiences. The man accused of directing the killing, Pierre-Claver Karangwa, lives freely in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Marcel has heard enough of the arrests and extradition proceedings taking place to dare hope that one day Karangwa will be brought to justice. But his optimism is tempered by the grim lessons he draws from the genocide.</p> <p>'I would say that the international community doesn't exist,' he said with undisguised bitterness. 'At the time of the genocide, we spoke about it but those countries did nothing and people were abandoned. Up until this moment I thought the international community didn't exist. And now, with the fact that these genocidaires are at liberty, I still see signs that it doesn't.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Redress helps torture survivors seek justice.

It was the holidays and all the family was together - I had four brothers, three sisters and my mother. Around 12 April [1994] rumours began to circulate that Tutsis in the area were going to be hunted down so we took our valuables and fled, moving at night and hiding in different places. We arrived about a week later at the parish of Mugina, where the local mayor Callixte Ndagijimana was protecting Tutsis, and found thousands of people there. </p> <p>A day or so later, after the murder of Ndagijimana, the Interahamwe [Hutu paramilitaries] surrounded the hill and began to attack us. We fought back with rocks for three days but they then launched a massive attack with guns and grenades, forcing us back into two churches, a large one and a small one. My family had split up and my sisters and mother were in the small church. The interahamwe surrounded it and started to throw grenades inside. We could hear the noise of children and mothers crying. </p> <p>The next day they broke down the door of our church and forced us out. We were made to take off our clothes and someone stood behind each of us with a machete. One of my family's neighbours - someone I knew very well - blew a whistle as if to start a football match and they began to hit us with their machetes. I lost consciousness and when I came to later, I saw everyone on the ground around me. There were children crying nearby because they weren't yet dead. </p> <p>In the following days, the interahamwe came back to go through our clothes looking for money. I had to pretend I was dead for two days. As they were rifling through our clothes they heard shots from the advancing [Tutsi] RPF army and fled. Later the Red Cross arrived and I was taken to the hospital. I was the only member of my family who survived the genocide. </p> <h2>Rwanda's genocide: How events unfolded</h2> <p><strong>The background </strong></p> <p><strong>1923</strong> Belgium accepts a mandate to govern Ruanda-Urundi.

  "<p>Outside, a swathe of ivy is eating its way down the concrete wall, as if under secret orders to swallow the building from public view. A tiny plaque reads: The Glasshouse. Strangely, there aren't any windows. </p> <p>It's a fortress, a defence against the urban sprawl of Bermondsey, south London, and home to artist Andrew Logan and his partner, Michael Davis, who designed it. But while the house looks hostile from the street, inside everything is outsized, shiny and colour-soaked. Dressed in a luminous yellow suit, adorned with brooches he made himself, 62-year-old Logan ushers his visitors in. </p> <p>'Let me show you round,' he smiles, still zen after his daily yoga session. Logan's been practising since he was 50, and is qualified to teach, holding lessons at his friend Zandra Rhodes's round the corner. He starts the tour at the velvet-curtained entrance lobby, walks past a ceiling-high rubber plant and enters an open-plan office/dining/kitchen space. Everything is dimly lit, until you follow him upstairs and - whoosh - the shady feel of the lower level is reversed. Sun beams through an expansive glass roof into a plant-fringed studio filled with Logan's joyous, eccentric work. Shards of light pinball between mirrored sculptures, mobiles made from Christmas baubles dangle from the roof and mosaic-encrusted heads watch from the sidelines.</p> <p>Settling on a daybed, Logan talks about his favourite projects. One of them is his eponymous museum in Berriew, Powys, where you can view his work all in one place. (He was born in Oxford and has no connection to Wales, but found an affordable building there when he was looking in 1988.) Logan is also fond of Black Icarus, a winged man made from resin and glass. It hangs in Baltimore's American Visionary Art Museum, a space dedicated to 'outsider art' by people who haven't been formally trained (he graduated in architecture). Finally, there's Millennium Pegasus - a bronze winged horse currently standing on a roundabout in Dudley. He is especially attached to that one because the town's residents voted for him to make it. </p> <p>For much of his life Logan has collaborated with and been inspired by Zandra Rhodes - his bust of her is in the National Portrait Gallery. They met on the London art scene in the Seventies. 'It was a wonderful era,' he remembers, 'because it was a time of great exploration and experimentation. Everyone had gone to New York - it was the days of the Factory - and so it was deeply unfashionable to be here. I loved it.' </p> <p>Logan quickly became known as an avantgarde artist and sculptor - one of his commissions was from Barbara Hulanicki to create oversized flowers for Biba's rooftop garden. He also became renowned for throwing theatrical parties in the studios where he lived, like the one at Butler's Wharf where he shared a warehouse with other influential artists including Derek Jarman and Howard Hodgkin. It was also the site of legendary events like the third Alternative Miss World (1975), the anarchic beauty contest he still runs today. Celia Birtwell and David Hockney were judges, and Jarman won as Miss Crepe Suzette. In 1976, Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood used the studio as the venue to throw a Valentine's Day ball at which the Sex Pistols played.</p> <p>Despite his glamorous friends, Logan is a family man. He talks affectionately about his sister and five brothers, his love for his parents, who died two years ago, and how Davis, whom he has been with since 1972, built this house, largely, it appears, for him. 'I said I wanted a view of the universe,' he recalls. Davis delivered. They paid \u00a3225,000 for the plot 20 years ago, when it contained a concrete garage with a flat on top. A year later, inspired by a trip to Mexico, Davis added another floor and painted it pink. He put stairs on the outside, cut windows in the front and installed the glass roof, resulting in the huge, conservatory-like studio. When they get up for breakfast they walk out under the sky; when they go to bed, they do so under the stars. </p> <p>'I had hoped this would inspire a lot of inner-city architecture,' Logan muses about the property, now worth \u00a33m. 'It's basically four walls with a hole in the top that you can do anything with.' But there's a catch to that: not everyone can create as instinctively as they do. And not everyone has a partner like Davis.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Andrew Logan's exhibition, Reflections 2008, runs to October 4 at The Arts Club, 40 Dover Street, London W1.

  "<p>Ron Hill was either born to run or has led one of the most contrary lives it is possible to imagine. He has run every day for the past 44 years - and has just reached his target of competing in 100 different countries before his 70th birthday.</p> <p>He has no intention of stopping. 'Why give up?' he said before going to the start line to complete his century in a half-marathon in the Faroe Islands earlier this month. 'If you enjoy eating a nice steak you don't stop just because you're getting old. I'm healthy and hopefully I'll live for a long time yet.'</p> <p>Hill, who in 1970 ran the world's second fastest marathon (the fastest if you disregard the one quicker time that was later discredited), still averages about 30 miles' training a week. Last year his aggregate running distance passed 150,000 miles. He will be 70 on Thursday, when he will take part in a 5km race at Littleborough in Lancashire with more than 500 others.</p> <p>The disappointment of finishing outside the top 10 in the marathon and 10,000metres at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 is what motivated Hill to knuckle down, as he puts it, and commit to running every day. He has kept up the sequence of doing at least a mile a day since then only by ignoring serious injury. 'I've been in a head-on car crash that broke my sternum and still ran a mile the next day. Another time I had a bunion operation and ran a mile a day for six weeks while in a plaster cast.' What about illness? 'Yes, I've been ill, but illness is nothing.'</p> <p>Earlier this year, when The Observer was trying to help Hill set up a race with British troops in Afghanistan, he sent me an email: 'On June 22 I fell coming down a steep road on the Greek island of Santorini breaking my left humerus bone in three places. I have run every day since. This will not stop me! Ron'.</p> <p>The Afghanistan race never materialised. Cue another email, this one a little disconsolate: 'The commanders in Kandahar were not willing to accept the risk of me running 12K in 52degC heat and at altitude without proper acclimatisation. Thanks for your efforts. Ron'.</p> <p>We exchanged emails again after his half marathon in the Faroes. 'It was a very tough course - lots of hills - but I managed it all right. Not so five metres after the finish. I looked down to stop my watch, failed to see a brick speed bump and went full length, hitting my left elbow and shoulder of my recently broken arm and my right knee. I don't think I have broken it again, but it is very sore and cannot have helped!'</p> <p>His failure to mention how fast he ran made me suspect he had been slow. Not a bit of it, even if he did think his time, which would have done credit to someone half his age, could have been better. Pressed to reveal all, he said: 'I told the organisers I was looking to beat two hours but was still slightly disappointed with 1:53:29. The winner took over 1hr 22mins.'</p> <p>Hill, who was born in Accrington, Lancashire, was a frail child. 'If I headed a football it would knock my head off and I was frightened to death of a cricket ball whizzing down at 50mph.'</p> <p>He was inspired to start running by Alf Tupper, a fictional hero of boys' comics. 'We lived in a two-up, two-down terrace house with a toilet in the backyard,' he says. 'Alf was slightly worse off because he didn't know who his parents were and he lived under railways arches, but he'd still go down to White City in London, hop over the railings and beat the people from Oxford and Cambridge.'</p> <p>At Accrington Grammar School, Hill says he was the only one who looked forward to the annual cross country races, which were compulsory. In his first year he finished in the top 10, a performance that, typically, he gives context by saying: 'That put me in the top five per cent on natural ability.</p> <p>'Nobody trained, and I didn't either then, but I was a lot more motivated than the ones who used to go round the corner to smoke a cigarette and join in on the way back.'</p> <p>Hill joined Clayton-le-Moors Harriers in 1953 but did not start to train seriously until he went to Manchester University in 1957. 'A bit like Alf Tupper, I thought, \"I'm not going to run with these university guys because they'll all be snobs\",' he says. 'But one Wednesday afternoon I went for a run with them and found they were quite regular guys. I did fairly well and they put me in the third team and I worked my way up from there.'</p> <p>Hill's first significant success was winning the Liverpool City marathon in August 1961. Fifteen miles was the most he had run previously and he entered only because he could find no other race to satisfy his desire to compete every weekend. He based his running on doing five-minute miles, far too quick then for a marathon, and remembers thinking: 'Why's it so slow? What's going on?' Despite having to run more than 10 miles further than ever before he held it together to win in 2hr 24min 22sec.</p> <p>The race finished in a packed Anfield football ground, the crowd having come principally to watch Liverpool play a pre-season friendly. The race did, though, receive coverage in the national press. 'My legs were solid and I wasn't going to do another marathon,' Hill says, 'but when I started to read accounts of the race in the Guardian and Telegraph I thought, \"Mmm, it's good this. I'm getting some recognition.\"'</p> <p>Liverpool was the first of 115 marathons for Hill, including those at the 1964 and 1972 Olympic Games in which he failed to produce his best form. He also ran two Olympic 10,000m, in 1964 and 1968.</p> <p>His outstanding marathons were in 1970. He lowered the record for the notoriously tough Boston race by three minutes to 2:10:30 in April that year and three months later at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh he did 2:09:28, the first sub 2:10 marathon over a course whose distance was reckoned to be correct. His time of 29min 24sec over the first 10km in Edinburgh was 2:04 marathon pace, recklessly fast many thought. But once again he kept going strongly and won by more than two-and-a-half minutes from Jim Alder of Scotland.</p> <p>His name is also associated with the manufacture of innovative running gear, which is something that has interested him since he emerged from university with a PhD in textile chemistry. In hot-weather races in the 1960s he introduced competing in a string vest and bikini shorts (often without shoes).</p> <p>He started his company, Ron Hill Sports, in 1970 'because I wasn't satisfied with the clothing that was being offered commercially by other companies'. 'I had experience of fabrics and understood how they worked. We introduced synthetics into running clothing instead of cotton, which gets very heavy when it's wet.' Other things the company developed included wrap-over shorts, mesh vests, waterproof running jackets and reflective strips 'because I was running to and from work in the dark in winter and wondered what I needed to stay safe'.</p> <p>At one point sales exceeded \u00a36m but the company ran into financial difficulties in the recession of the early 1990s and Hill sold out. These days he makes what he calls technical socks, and the business, Hilly Clothing, is thriving.</p> <p>Hill, who lives in Hyde, has a theory that it is not only the rise of other nations that has caused British middle- and long-distance running to decline. 'In 2002, the Commonwealth Games were held in Manchester in a stadium that I can see from my road. I was a world record holder and Commonwealth Games marathon champion and I wasn't even invited to go to the stadium. That just shows what status we have. Kids must say, \"Why bother?\"' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Read Ron Hill's monthly blog at www.hillyclothing.co.uk</p> <h2>On your marks: the 100 stops on Ron Hill's international odyssey</h2> <p>Holland <br>Switzerland <br>France <br>Belgium <br>Spain <br>Ireland <br>West Germany <br>Brazil <br>Finland <br>Japan <br>Tunisia <br>Morocco <br>Jamaica <br>Hungary <br>Italy <br>USA <br>South Africa <br>Mexico <br>Greece <br>Canada <br>Puerto Rico <br>New Zealand <br>Slovakia <br>Turkey <br>Poland <br>Zimbabwe <br>Bermuda <br>Taiwan <br>Hong Kong <br>Norway <br>Bahrain <br>South Korea <br>Cyprus <br>Trinidad &amp; Tobago <br>Barbados <br>Malta <br>Thailand <br>Austria <br>Sweden <br>Saudi Arabia <br>Gibraltar <br>Costa Rica <br>Portugal <br>Bulgaria <br>Denmark <br>Luxembourg <br>Cameroon <br>Benin <br>Kenya <br>East Germany <br>Guatemala <br>Egypt <br>Liechtenstein <br>Gambia <br>Ascension Island <br>Falkland Islands <br>Czech Republic <br>Croatia <br>Estonia <br>Dubai <br>Jordan <br>Iceland <br>China <br>Oman <br>Israel <br>Algeria <br>Chile <br>Lithuania <br>Australia <br>Ukraine <br>Colombia <br>Cayman Islands <br>Cuba <br>Mauritius <br>Latvia <br>Slovenia <br>Moldova <br>Singapore <br>Macau <br>Curacao <br>Aruba <br>Romania <br>Lebanon <br>Russia <br>Monaco <br>Cambodia <br>Pakistan <br>Andorra <br>Malaysia <br>Peru <br>Bosnia <br>Sri Lanka <br>Ecuador <br>Namibia <br>Montenegro <br>Argentina <br>Uruguay <br>Serbia <br>Panama <br>Faroe Islands*</p>",
  "<p>Romania to launch a campaign to lure tens of thousands of its key workers and students back from Britain by telling them their long-term economic and professional prospects could be brighter in their homeland.</p> <p>The action by the Romanian government - which is emphasising the high cost of living in the UK and the falling value of the pound - is the opening shot in a 'competition for labour' that could see UK companies and the NHS suffer a serious loss of manpower to former communist states over coming months.</p> <p>Poland - with more than one million citizens in the UK - has drawn up similar plans to encourage so-called 'reverse migration', advertising the attractions of its own economy in English and Polish newspapers in this country and offering special loans to help those who return.</p> <p>Ion Jinga, the Romanian ambassador in London, told The Observer that he wanted to encourage Romanians to take a pride in helping their own country to develop, rather than see them move permanently to the UK.</p> <p>Romania, which enjoyed 8 per cent economic growth in the first half of this year, is suffering from acute labour shortages caused by an exodus of workers following its accession to the European Union in 2007.</p> <p>Next month the Romanian embassy will stage a conference for Romanian students in London at which it will promote the benefits of returning home after their studies. It has 50,000 workers in this country, among them many doctors, nurses and construction workers whose skills are now in high demand at home.</p> <p>Jinga said a number of factors including the high cost of renting homes in the UK and the falling value of the pound had to be weighed against the benefits of higher salaries in the UK. 'Salaries are not everything,' he said. 'It is brilliant to work and live in England, but there are important incentives for returning.' He added: 'We cannot afford to lose our best brains.' </p> <p>Although Jinga insists he is working closely with the British government, the Romanians' action will be seen by many as a counter-attack against the UK in response to special 'transition' rules that London imposed on Romania and Bulgaria when the countries joined the EU in January 2007.</p> <p>Because of concerns about the level of immigration at the time, Tony Blair's government imposed a seven-year programme of restrictions under which Romanian and Bulgarian citizens had to apply for jobs in specific sectors in order to work in this country. Previously people from new EU entrant countries had been allowed in without any restrictions.</p> <p>Romania and Bulgaria felt victimised. Although they are still working for the restrictions to be lifted - and for better conditions for those working here - their main thrust is now to make sure as many skilled people as possible remain in their homeland.</p> <p>Already there is evidence that British industry is suffering as eastern Europeans begin to return home. A recent report by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that 540,000 of the adult migrants who have come from the EU's new member states have already returned.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses said: 'It will be worrying for many companies if there is a wholesale movement back home.' Originally it was envisaged that Romanian construction workers would play an essential role in building the stadium and village for the 2012 London Olympics.</p>",
  "<p>After showing signs of an unlikely metamorphosis into the United States' version of Colin Montgomerie, Phil Mickelson settled back into something closer to his normal Ryder Cup routine yesterday. The wheels came off the great left-hander's partnership with Anthony Kim during the morning foursomes, the pair proving themselves unable to reproduce the sparkling performance of the opening day. Teamed with Hunter Mahan in the afternoon, Mickelson pulled himself together but still ended the day resembling Monty, Europe's absent hero, in nothing more than his generous embonpoint and creamy golf swing.</p> <p>The enforced dissolution of the partnership between the 38-year-old Mickelson and the 23-year-old Kim came as a disappointment to their captain. It was early in the summer that Mickelson called Paul Azinger and put in a request to be paired with his fellow Californian. With two tour wins to his credit this season along with more than $4m in winnings, the 23-year-old Kim is many people's candidate to be the new generation's leading challenger to Tiger Woods, whom Mickelson partnered so disastrously during the 2004 tournament at the suggestion of Hal Sutton.</p> <p>This is Mickelson's seventh Ryder Cup, but he came into it with the miserable record of one and a half points from the two most recent editions and Azinger seemed to be taking a chance on Friday when he sent out the three-time major winner as his point man, with a rookie alongside him. But the Americans fought back from three down to halve their match against Padraig Harrington and Robert Karlsson, earning credit from Jim Furyk for getting the whole opening-day US revival under way. 'They turned the momentum,' Furyk said. 'They kind of led the team out there.' They did even better again in the afternoon four-ball against Harrington and Graeme McDowell, coming back from a similar deficit to win the match and generate the first sparks that would turn into a late-afternoon wildfire of enthusiasm around the course.</p> <p>'It was a fun day for us,' Mickelson said later. 'After being three down in both matches, we played with a lot of heart and emotion. I love playing with this guy. He has a lot of talent, a lot of game. It was fun for me to get that youthful exuberance today. It's infectious.'</p> <p>The contagion seemed to have lasted overnight, to judge from the way Mickelson and Kim set off in their opening foursome yesterday morning. Confronting Henrik Stenson, in his second Ryder Cup, and Oliver Wilson, hitting his first ball in the competition, they were four up after six holes and were bestowing wide smiles and high-fives upon their supporters as they passed between the galleries on their way from green to tee.</p> <p>But then came an unexpected reversal of the previous day's shifts of momentum. Required to hit a blind second shot over a huge bank at the doglegged 500-yard 6th hole, Wilson produced a marvellously clean strike to leave the ball just short of the green. The hole could not be saved, but the brio of the recovery gave them fresh heart. And, as it happened, Mickelson and Kim were about to loosen their own wheel nuts. Mickelson's sliced drive over the gallery at the long 7th left Kim to play the ball off a patch of cracked asphalt, a task he accomplished with ease, as if it were a lark. Mickelson's next shot cannoned away off a stone wall, forfeiting the hole.</p> <p>Kim's tee shot found a greenside bunker in the short eighth, further cutting their lead. Two holes later the younger man again landed in a trap and Mickelson's sand shot, from a reasonable lie, flew across the fairway and into the trees to leave them only one up. A bogey five at the 12th was enough to level the match.</p> <p>The increasingly erratic Mickelson's drive at the 15th landed in the trees, from where Kim launched a showy attempt to bend it into the green. Instead the ball hit a tree, bounced off a steward and plopped into the creek. Their opponents' crushing answer was a nerveless birdie that gave the Europeans the lead.</p> <p>With Mickelson trying to reimpose some degree of control over his wayward game and Kim furiously trying to hit his way out of trouble, neither man appeared capable of taking the responsibility for restoring a degree of steadiness to the partnership. Facing a 20-footer on the penultimate green to keep them in the match, Mickelson could not deliver. A partnership that had looked like Azinger's trump card now lay in ruins. </p> <p>Both Americans deserved to be benched, but Mickelson was sent back out alongside the 26-year-old Mahan, another Californian, for an afternoon rehab session. The plan seemed to have worked when his birdies at the 2nd and 3rd holes clawed back an advantage immediately established by the Swedish pair of Stenson and Robert Karlsson and gave the Americans a lead they increased through Mickelson's eagle at the par-five 7th, before of a wonderful run of Karlsson birdies pinned them back and opened the way for the Europeans to share a point.</p>",
  "<p>The more acidic an apple, the more likely it is that its flesh will turn into a cloud-like froth as it cooks. Hence the popularity of the Bramley, or the more richly flavoured but rarer Peasgood Nonsuch, for baking: they will puff up like a ball gown, with beads of honeyed froth peeping at the brim. Once the leaves start to turn I get a fancy for a baked apple, or something made from it, like a tart apple sauce for a rich roast of pork, or a dish of apple snow with a slick of blackberry sauce stirred in. </p> <p>I made a knife-sharp sauce for the Sunday roast last week with a few blackberries from the garden hedge thrown in. Despite it looking like two courses served at the same time, I think the result was rather good and no one thought it odd. Blackberries and apples have gone together since God was a boy, but rarely in the savoury sense. </p> <p>Good apples for a palate-cleansing sauce, nicely shafting the richness of the meat, are not hard to find if you have a mind to. Grenadier isn't bad, but Bess Pool, Howgate Wonder, Norfolk Beauty, Lord Derby and Dumelow's Seedling turn up at apple fairs and farmers' markets. Though good luck finding the rarer ones outside the odd country market.</p> <p>Whether they're picked to be eaten now or for storing throughout the winter (Dumelow, Howgate and Norfolk store well), they all have a certain acidity level. This is what I want in an apple which I am going to partner with any part of the pig. Black pudding and sliced apple, both fried till their edges are etched with gold and about to fall apart; fat bangers slowly baked till their skins shine; a casserole of diced fatty pork and thyme leaves - all need an apple with a bit of bite to it. </p> <p>There have been British-grown blackberries around all summer. These plump berries were grown here by specialists, and to be honest, they aren't bad. The glossy berries have been a feature of my weekday breakfasts this summer, but like all supermarket fruit they are bred primarily for sweetness, so you fail to get the characteristic warm/sour notes of a true hedgerow blackberry.</p> <p>Today there are clouds of berries hanging over my garden fence. When they are not consumed raw, a little sugar and low heat turn them into a pleasingly purple slop for stirring into apple pur\u00e9e to take the queasy edge off roast pork belly (rub the flesh with salt, pepper and crushed juniper before you roast). And I might tell you that it is gorgeous with duck, too. </p> <h2>Roast duck legs with squash and blackberry and apple sauce</h2> <p>I tend to eat duck legs far more often than a whole bird. They have a neatness to them, and seem better value. You need just one a piece. Recipes for pot-roasting them are rare, but cooked that way the results can be tender in the extreme and a pleasant change from the usual crisp-skinned roast bird or grilled breasts. Soft, moist flesh is the goal here, with the squash soaking up some of the herb-seasoned fat. Serves 4.</p> <p><strong>4 plump duck legs</strong><br><strong>about 8 small sprigs of thyme</strong><br><strong>sea salt and whole black peppercorns</strong><br><strong>a small squash or pumpkin</strong><br><strong>2 bay leaves</strong></p> <p>Pull the thyme leaves from their branches (you could leave some stems whole) and pound them with \u00bd tsp of sea salt and the same of black peppercorns. I use a pestle and mortar, but a wooden rolling pin in a bowl works, too. Season the duck legs generously. </p> <p>Put the legs in a deep casserole with a heavy base. Place the casserole over a moderate heat and quickly brown the duck pieces on both sides. The skin should colour to a pale amber; the fat should melt to form a shallow film in the pan. </p> <p>Halve, peel and de-seed the squash, pulling away and discarding any coarse fibres from the centre. Cut the flesh into thick chunks. Tuck the squash alongside the duck legs with the bay leaves, turning them in the seasoned fat as you go. Cover with a lid then turn the heat to low and leave for 45- 50 minutes, until you can pull the flesh easily from the bones with a fork. You shouldn't expect the skin to be crisp, but soft, fragrant with thyme and meltingly tender, and the squash at the point of collapse.</p> <p>Transfer the duck legs and squash to warm plates and serve with the blackberry and apple sauce that follows.</p> <h2>A blackberry and apple sauce for pork or duck</h2> <p>Apple sauce is something I make in any number of ways: with 'cooking' or 'eating' apples either in a shallow pan with a little water, or by baking the apples whole. The last method seems to give a deeper, more concentrated flavour. The quantity of sugar you add is dependent on the sweetness of the apple variety. </p> <p><strong>4 large Bramley-type apples</strong><br><strong>150g blackberries</strong><br><strong>a little icing sugar </strong></p> <p>Score the skin of the apples round the middle (so they don't explode) and put them in a baking dish. Bake at 180C/gas mark 4 (or whatever temperature your roast is on) for a good 40 minutes till they have puffed up and the apple is soft and frothy. </p> <p>Put the blackberries into a small pan, add 1 tbsp of stock or water and bring to the boil. Crush lightly with a fork.</p> <p>Scrape the flesh from the apples' skins into a bowl. Using a small whisk or fork, beat in the sugar. Stir the crushed blackberries through the apple and serve with the duck above or with a roast shoulder or loin of pork. </p> <h2>Roast apples with apple custard ice cream</h2> <p>Serves 4 (with some extra ice cream)</p> <p><strong>for the ice cream:</strong></p> <p><strong>1kg sharp apples </strong><br><strong>200g golden caster sugar</strong><br><strong>400ml cream</strong><br><strong>4 egg yolks</strong><br><strong>for the baked apples:</strong><br><strong>4 large dessert apples</strong><br><strong>a little butter</strong></p> <p>To make the ice cream, peel the apples, core them and cut them into thick slices. Put them in a heavy-bottomed saucepan with half the sugar and let them stew slowly over a moderate to low heat. (They need no water, but keep an eye on them so they don't burn.) Once a little juice has formed in the bottom of the pan, cover with a lid and leave to simmer gently for 20 minutes or so, stirring from time to time, till the apples are fluffy. Mash with a fork and leave to cool. </p> <p>To make the custard, bring the cream to the boil. Beat the eggs and remaining sugar till thick, then pour in the hot cream and stir. Rinse the saucepan and return the custard to it, stirring the mixture over a low heat till it starts to thicken slightly.

  "<h2>1 York &amp; Albany, London</h2> <p>Gordon Ramsay's ever-growing empire takes a new turn on 29 September with the opening of his first hotel, the York and Albany in Camden, London. This early 19th-century John Nash townhouse has been reworked to provide a restaurant, bar and deli with 10 hotel rooms, two of which are suites overlooking Regents Park. The dining rooms will serve seasonal and uncomplicated dishes, while the deli, in the former stables, will sell cured meats, cheeses, jams and ice creams made on site (perfect for impromptu picnics in the park). Ramsay gave Escape a sneak preview last week, and we can report that it's already looking impressive. The bedrooms, created by British fashion designer Russell Sage, are all highly individual, with dark-wood antiques, lavish bedding, and fabulous old four-posters in some rooms. Ramsay said he'd 'get this one right' before opening more hotels, but let slip he was considering another in Oxford. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><strong> 127-129 Parkway, London, NW1 7PS; <a href=\"http://www.gordonramsay.com/yorkandalbany\">gordonramsay.com/yorkandalbany</a>; doubles from \u00a3155</strong></p> <h2>2 Rogan and Company, Cumbria</h2> <p>Chef Simon Rogan put the sleepy market town of Cartmel in the Lake District on the map with his Michelin-starred menu at L'Enclume. This year he has opened a second, less formal and less expensive eatery in the town called Rogan and Company, a 16th-century inn oozing charm with log fires, beamed ceilings, whitewashed walls and welcoming leather tub chairs. Completing Rogan's domination of Cartmel, he has slowly opened bedrooms for his guests around the town: seven above L'Enclume, and two others next to the new brasserie. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong><strong> The Square, Cartmel, Cumbria; 01539 535917; <a href=\"http://www.roganandcompany.co.uk\">roganandcompany.co.uk</a>; doubles from \u00a3100</strong></p> <h2>3 Le Manoir Aux Quat' Saisons, Oxfordshire</h2> <p>A very French air pervades at the quintessentially English manor house that houses Raymond Blanc's two Michelin star restaurant and hotel.

His wife, Lisa, has breathed new life into the Victorian interior, coupling the original features, such as Welsh flagstone floors, with log-burning stoves and handmade furniture. The gutsy menu changes daily, reflecting local, organic and seasonal produce, both bought and foraged; think pappardelle, braised longhorn short ribs, osso bucco style, wild sea trout, razor clams, samphire, broad beans, dill beurre blanc.

  "<p>It was Arthur Koestler, writing during the Second World War, after the existence of the camps became known, who first pointed out that there are limits to the human rights project. Those who described what was going on in places such as Auschwitz-Birkenau were obliged, Koestler lamented, to become 'Screamers'. The Screamers did succeed in reaching listeners, but only momentarily. 'You can convince them for an hour,' Koestler said, 'and their mental half-defence begins to work, and in a week the shrug of incredulity has returned.'</p> <p>For every brutally honest Koestler, however, there have always been others prepared to believe that humans are either basically good or susceptible to persuasion when it comes to saving the world. Frumpy, usually dressed in black, reviled by conservatives as much as she was revered by her progressive followers, Franklin Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor, was in 1948 the most famous woman in American public life. In her weekly radio shows she offered listeners an unceasing flow of upbeat liberal homilies. It was she who presented the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the General Assembly on a winter's day in 1948, in Paris. It's hard not to sense that this was a historic moment. She stresses that the document is not 'a statement of law and legal obligation'; but that it may well become 'the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere'. Most poignant is Eleanor's assertion that human rights are based on what she calls 'a spiritual fact'. Man must have freedom to develop his full stature, she states, 'and through common effort to raise the level of human dignity'.</p> <p>The declaration was one of a number of documents adopted by the newly created UN as part of the postwar effort to save humanity from further bloodshed. It is emphatically a document of its time, making no mention of many things that liberals would now regard as their inalienable rights - to express one's own sexuality by choosing partners of either sex in perfect freedom - and of course no mention of the death penalty and abortion.</p> <p>Much of the declaration reeks of the collectivist, welfarist consensus of the late 1940s. David Cameron and contemporary conservatives would find nothing to object to in its evocation of its importance of the family as the cornerstone of civilisation. Truly striking, however, are the guarantees of free speech, freedom to migrate (as crucial a right for refugees in the 1940s as it is for the world's migrants today), and the basic kit of political freedom that comprises what democrats value in the contemporary world. 'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers' (Article 19). No one could have put it better, even after all these years of attempts to implement these principles.</p> <p>I wonder what Eleanor would make of our world. She would be astonished by the proliferation of treaties and declarations designed to further the cause, and she would certainly be encouraged by the arrival of a new international style of public life. No non-governmental organisations (NGOs) existed in her lifetime, and we can imagine her as a member of Amnesty or Human Rights Watch. But she might be shocked to discover that the undertakings made in the wake of the mid-century catastrophe hadn't borne much fruit. The killing fields are still open, though they may be more carefully hidden and on a smaller scale. What the poet Robert Lowell called 'the blind swipe of the pruner and his knife' still disturbs the Sabbath rest.</p> <p>In 1948 the Russians sent Andrei Vyshinsky, the judge who had presided over Stalin's show trials, to the UN. He declined to sign the Declaration, referring to it as 'just a collection of pious phrases.' In post-Communist Russia, journalists are killed with impunity. It is still possible to fight wars in the name of peace or human rights - on behalf of the beleaguered South Ossetians - but no one must pretend that this is the real reason for the conflict. Perhaps hypocrisy is on the wane. </p> <p>Meanwhile China has inscribed a commitment to human rights in its constitution. During the Olympics, acting under international pressure, the Chinese created a site in which its citizens might be given official permission to hold demonstrations. Two 70-year-old women wishing to protest that their flat had been torn down were given a year of 're-educative labour', though the sentence was suspended pending their good behaviour. I suppose this is a step forward from the Cultural Revolution in which more than a million Chinese were beaten up, tortured and killed in what historians now see as a bout of state-sponsored anarchy.</p> <p>But what of the Western idea of 'humanitarian intervention' - pioneered in Kosovo and repeated, with less conspicuous success, in Iraq. War was fought in the 1940s in order to save humanity, not to dispose of unwanted minor tyrants. Is it possible to impose democracy when the means involve violating human rights? Nothing in the traditional lexicon of human rights gives any guidance in such matters. </p> <p>As the neocons tell us, parts of the world appear bent on perfecting authoritarian systems. Because of their beliefs, Islamists can have no regard for secular rights. Just as worrying is the assertion (invariably made by those who wish to dispense with them, finding expression in many deeply shocking documents churned out by the UN) that human rights belong to the West, either a rich man's toy or a legacy of imperialists. </p> <p>My own worries are somewhat different. Human rights may simply be a last, ineffectual expression of Samaritanism in a post-Christian world in which suffering is commemorated but no one ever meets the victims. Trying to impose standards by means of pieces of paper which express high humanitarian aims may be what we do when we no longer have the power or the will to engage with the messiness of real politics. Put another way, human rights may merely be a way of appearing to save the world for those who don't want to try too hard to do so. </p> <p>Not long ago, I attended the annual Amnesty human-rights media awards. I've spent much of my career producing films in which atrocities are documented, but I was shocked by the procession of horrors. As one atrocious, unspeakable act after another was brought to light by means of images projected above our heads, it became hard to recall the many courageous journalists, film-makers and activists whose work was being celebrated. Articles about female foeticide were honoured, and there were films (I had indeed been involved with them) about Darfur and the dungeons of George Bush. Index on Censorship was awarded a prize for its expos\u00e9 of the murders of Russian journalists, crimes unpunished and greeted with indifference by the Russian elite. The most touching moment was the award in absentia of a prize to Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani, a Yemeni journalist jailed for 'insulting the President'. It seemed only appropriate that the prize should be given by the BBC's Alan Johnston, fresh from his own imprisonment in Gaza. </p> <p>Chardonnay is served on such occasions, and a glass was in my hand when I encountered a journalist friend from the BBC. He appeared chastened, anxious, and his thoughts mirrored mine. 'So much care goes into the making of these films, the writing of these articles. And people risk their lives,' he said. 'But does anyone actually watch them? Does anyone care?' </p> <p>For the past months, I've tried to answer this question, navigating my way around activists and theorists. I've found many eloquent defenders of human rights. But I notice, too, an impatience with the subject among those whom I interview. 'Yes we know that rights are important,' they wish to say, 'but do we always have to talk about them in a hand-wringing way? Can't we find better news about rights?' And I notice, too, a weary anger when it becomes apparent to both of us that, alas, the news will never be very good. Still, human rights can be exciting. Sir Geoffrey Nice, the man who spent four years of his life trying Slobodan Milosevic, carries the trial around on his laptop. Here is another intelligent human being with whom I can jointly define the nature of contemporary atrocity.</p> <p>But I meet optimists, too. The lawyer and author Geoffrey Robertson speaks out against obscurantists in his book Crimes Against Humanity with the eloquence and gusto of a north London Voltaire. 'There is much more awareness of human rights and we have made a start in enforcing them,' he tells me. In between visits to the Hague, where he's selecting judges for the UN tribunal, he outlines his pet project - a Convention Against Tyranny capable of giving legal justification in order to overthrow evildoers. </p> <p>'At present it would be confined to situations where genocide or widespread murder and torture are being inflicted by state agencies,' he says. 'But there are other forms of barbarism: the Taliban's denial of education to women and girls and execution of homosexuals. Mugabe's destruction of democracy and use of starvation and thuggery as political weapons. That is for the future.'</p> <p>If not beady-eyed, the redoubtable Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty, turns out to be nearly as positive. 'You have to think of the Europe of 1938,' she says. 'The biggest European country was ruled by a government that persecuted minorities, arranging \"disappearances\". That would be unthinkable now.' Khan points to all the treaties signed in the past 60 years. 'We don't need any more declarations about rights,' she says. 'The problem is implementation.' She describes to me a world in which a civil society involving millions globally is campaigning on behalf of rights only to find themselves frustrated by politicians. I tell her that I am only partly convinced by this. Politicians are conservative people, but there must be a reason why they are so reluctant to make a stand. </p> <p>We are all agreed, however, when it comes to evoking the damage wrought to the cause of human rights by the so-called war against terror. In the name of national security, America, viewed in 1945 as the sole beacon of a world in darkness, has attempted to re-establish torture as a legitimate method of interrogation, practising it on a substantial scale. Dozens of books chronicle the ineptitude with which the Bush administration stumbled into Iraq. The best is Jane Mayer's The Dark Side, a bestseller in the US. It has yet to find a publisher here. Dip into any chapter and you will find out about 'interrogation' in the new century:</p> <p><strong>'11:15</strong>: Told detainee dog is held in higher esteem... Began to teach detainee lessons such as stay, come and bark...</p> <p><strong>13:00</strong>: Dog tricks continue... Interrogator showed photos of 9-11 victims and told him he should bark happy for these people. Interrogator showed photos of al-Qaeda terrorist and told detainee he should growl at these people. A towel was placed on detainee's head like a burka, and interrogator proceeded to give detainee dance lessons.' </p> <p>The most convincing explanation for the Bush debacle comes from a former top Bush administration lawyer who Mayer quotes. The lawyer, Philip Zelikow, tells her, 'Fear and anxiety were exploited by zealots and fools.' Americans were ready to go along with torture as long as it was called something else. So the lawyers who betrayed America were responding to something more than a public mood. But can we really suppose that these emotions are uniquely American, and that any country, confronted with what is perceived as a threat to its security, won't go the same way? Why should the dark side not prove a common destination in the new century? 'American ideals are undercut by torture. It makes nonsense of our constitutional protections and our claims that all humans have inalienable rights under the law,' Mayer says. 'It hurts the rest of the world, too - because when America forsakes its role as a defender of human rights, it gives licence to tyrannies everywhere.'</p> <p>British governments, too, have been swayed by fear and anxiety. As junior allies we're complicit in what the law lord Johan Steyn called 'the legal black hole of Guant\u00e1namo.' As Conor Gearty, professor of law at the London School of Economics, points out, Anglo-American linkage of human rights and the war against terror has tried to turn them 'into a basis for selective aggression abroad and an alibi for brutality at home'.</p> <p>Another optimist (and international lawyer), Philippe Sands, urges me to take a long view of human rights. He says that rights are the only riposte to the notion, enshrined in European law for centuries, that the state and its representatives have unlimited powers. We should not expect that doctrines adhered to for so long can be overthrown in a year or a decade. Sands was involved in the Pinochet case. He sees the detention of the Chilean dictator as the moment when it was established that for 'crimes against humanity' there should be no frontiers. The law lords did decide that the dictator had a case to answer - not in the country in which the crimes were committed, but where the prosecution was initiated. Home Secretary Jack Straw did return Pinochet to Chile, but the decision was made on health grounds.</p> <p>And yet superpowers do still act to protect themselves, invoking sovereignty. America posed throughout the Cold War as the world's defender of freedoms - but things were different when US citizens might conceivably find themselves prosecuted under international law. Like the Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on Genocide was signed in 1948, after a long, single-handed campaign by Rafael Lemkin, a Polish refugee settled in New York. However, the US Senate declined to ratify the document. Each day the Senate was in session, for 19 years, Senator William Proxmire got to his feet and made a four-minute speech condemning genocide. But it took the charm of Ronald Reagan (and presumably the death of most of the remaining concentration-camp guards in exile somewhere in America) to persuade senators to overcome their objections.</p> <p>As Samantha Power shows in her history of genocide, A Problem from Hell, America proved to be reluctant when it came to preventing genocide. Invariably, it was decided that vital interests were not at stake in the poor, remote countries where killings took place. Officials could then say that it was too late to do anything. Afterwards came the moment to say that it should never happen again. This is what happened in Bosnia, and, most horrifyingly, in Rwanda. With Obama or McCain President, the camps in Guant\u00e1namo will finally be emptied and closed down. But can we expect to see American troops freely used to prevent genocide in places like Darfur? I somehow don't think so.</p> <p>The most important NGO active in human rights remains Amnesty International. It was launched in the pages of this newspaper in 1961 by a London lawyer and a group of fellow liberals. 'The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence,' Peter Benenson began. Amnesty would seek to adopt individual 'prisoners of conscience', writing letters to the governments which had incarcerated them or encouraging others to do so. </p> <p>Amnesty's aims were carefully limited, and the prisoners adopted came from the West as well as the Communist bloc and the developing world. (Those who advocated violence were not selected, and Amnesty felt ambivalent about Nelson Mandela, first adopting and then rejecting him when he was found guilty of sabotage, although they did acknowledge that people like him might 'feel or find themselves forced into a position in which the only road to freedom is violence...'). Soon letters poured in from a new breed of human-rights activist. Numberless teenagers (myself included) formed Amnesty cells at school. The approach of carefully selecting prisoners, restricting Amnesty's aims, appeared satisfactory.</p> <p>But times changed, and during the 1970s it became possible for Western governments to raise human-rights questions with their Soviet bloc counterparts. In consequence human rights were no longer the sole property of NGOs. As the scope of campaigning increased, those who practised it became more aggressive. In danger of being overtaken by its rivals, Amnesty did move with the times. But it was not until 2003, under Khan's stewardship, that its charter was substantially revised. Amnesty now runs campaigns in relation to the fullest range of 'economic and social rights'. Khan is proud of the recent Stop Violence Against Women in which rape, honour killings, domestic violence and clitoridectomy were targeted.</p> <p>Traditionalists criticised the changes, suggesting that this would make Amnesty indistinguishable from other liberal NGOs. They were upset by the professionalisation of what appeared to be an institution set in its ways. Spread over many floors and located to the east of the city in Shoreditch, as clean-lined as a newly completed city academy, the new Amnesty headquarters is a daunting place, with activists beavering away on each floor. It's hard not to be impressed by so much seriousness. But I find myself surprised, too, by the jolliness of so many working there. Can they really spend each day trying to nudge the immobile Home Office into treating asylum seekers just a little better? Can they remain motivated over the long slog required to get the UN to create some sort of document aimed at limiting the social ravages caused globally by the arms trade? It would appear that somehow they do, though I realise that I would find such diligence testing. </p> <p>However, it's hard here to evade the central contradiction of Amnesty, which is that of the human-rights movement itself. Amnesty still exists by placing in the public eye what, in perfect earnestness, it aims to put an end to. As an institution Amnesty is dedicated to unceasing, endless struggle. I ask a researcher whether the work doesn't get to her. 'Sometimes it does,' says simply. 'But there are compensations.'</p> <p>I can find an echo of such feelings in my own experience. My way into the human-rights maze came via a trap door labelled Srebrenica. A Cry From the Grave is a film which gives an exhaustive, minute-by-minute account of the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in 1995. The director, Leslie Woodhead, says, 'Like the crimes committed, it won't go away. You can see a version of it now in the town's museum, where the massacre is commemorated.' </p> <p>Geoffrey Nice was the prosecutor in the four-year trial of Slobodan Milosevic at the Yugoslav tribunal in The Hague, and I ask him what he now thinks of the experience. Did he feel cheated when Milosevic died before the proceedings were completed? Lanky, hyperarticulate, Nice is frank and uncomplicated when it comes to admitting that the system is far from perfect. 'It would have been good to secure a conviction, and obviously I wanted one,' he says. 'But the record stands. Anyone who wants to re-establish the reputation of Milosevic will have to contend with what we found out.' But Nice proves to have complex views about prosecuting war criminals. He senses that it is time to abandon the all-out model of Nuremberg, in which a verdict is also a political statement of sorts. We should come to regard international courts as normal, uncontroversial. If it isn't always possible to secure convictions (or indeed to try people, because political considerations make that impossible), maybe we shouldn't worry too much.</p> <p>Only a few years ago Henry Kissinger was shocked when he was presented, via the manager of the Ritz Hotel in Paris, with a legal document asking for his help in sorting out aspects of the Pinochet-era killings in Chile. Unsuccessful attempts have been made in a German court to indict Donald Rumsfeld. I don't think Rumsfeld, or indeed George W Bush, have anything to worry about, even if they do take their holidays in Europe. But in The Hague a few weeks ago, you could choose to see a freshly shaved, suited ex-New Age guru and former Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska Radovan Karadzic appear in court, declining to enter a plea, or watch Charles Taylor, the ex-President of Liberia, fumble with his papers as he watched another witness give an account of his role in the horrifying 10-year civil war. The courtrooms are heavily protected with giant, aquarium-like windows. They're unpicturesquely located in buildings that resemble the headquarters of waste-disposal companies. However, in their anonymity, they are deeply moving places, expressing a determination that impunity should be punished.</p> <p>Many years in the creation, the new International Criminal Court (ICC) was backed by Clinton and melodramatically 'unsigned' by George Bush. Bizarre regulations restrict those who can be tried there to citizens of signatory countries, or cases approved by the UN Security Council. (This means that no Russian, Chinese or American war criminal will ever be brought before the court; indeed the court has been criticised for targeting exclusively offenders from Africa, thus appearing the instrument of neo-imperialism.) But Nice hopes that the US may one day change its mind. 'The real problem with international law is how hard it is to keep independent of politics,' he says. 'Imagine you are running the court, choosing which cases to prosecute. There are war crimes committed everywhere. How do you know which ones to choose? It doesn't mean that you mustn't choose, but it's difficult.'</p> <p>In Albert Camus's short, stinging monologue The Fall (1956), Jean-Baptiste Clamence, a seedy, drunk lawyer, buttonholes a reluctant listener in an Amsterdam bar. On first reading, the book appears to be a perfect-pitch rendering of the worst, smarmiest French intellectual, a man whom vanity impelled towards the humanitarian racket and for whom not believing has become synonymous with honesty. 'It is so late,' Camus's cynic tells his interlocutor as he strives to avoid falling into a canal. 'One is always too late.' Latterly, however, I've begun to appreciate the text in a different fashion. Depressed when he wrote The Fall, Camus began to ask himself a simple question. What would happen to us all if, while, pretending that the lives of others mattered, we ceased to act as if they did? The answer is that we would, like Camus's ex-judge, no longer think of ourselves as human beings. </p> <p>Inevitably the human-rights narrative comes readily peopled with good victims and evil perpetrators. It abounds in worthy clich\u00e9s. My own plea is that in films or articles, human rights politics should be depicted like anything else - not in black and white, as slogans or in pop lyrics, but with the right component of muted, real-life greys. Think of the unassuming, wholly remarkable Canadian Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who commanded the ill-fated UN force in Rwanda and refused to leave the country. Years later he was found drunk and weeping on a park bench. It appears that Dallaire never recovered from his experiences in Rwanda, though he was always ready to say that his own sufferings were nothing beside the ones he had witnessed. But Dallaire's sense of guilt and complicity proved embarrassing to the media covering his story. For reasons that were never discussed, he never seemed an appropriate protagonist.</p> <p>I also feel that human-rights activists should no longer be sniffy about what Irene Khan calls 'principled pragmatism'. This was the message of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a student of Camus and existentialist philosophy, and the most effective, most dedicated fighter for rights in our time. Brazilian, the son of a diplomat, Sergio began his UN career with a belief that laws and resolutions alone would stop the killing. Speedily disabused, despising the ponderous UN bureaucracy in which he needed to survive, he went to the opposite extreme of seeking to conciliate killers, in the forlorn hope of getting them to behave better. However, it would seem that Sergio's view of the world, too, was altered by Srebrenica. Appointed to the despised, underfunded post of UN Commissioner for Human Rights, he began to read feverishly. </p> <p>He began to see that human rights, far from being an optional extra, to be discarded when they weren't useful, were essential. They were the new global 'rule of law'. Abstractions such as peace and security made sense only if states treated their citizens properly - and were prepared to extend such rights to the citizens of other states. But he also thought that human-rights culture had wrongly neglected the notion of dignity. Freedoms meant nothing if people could have no sense of their own worth. And maybe flawed states with a minimum of democratic practices but some legal rights were better than the pseudo-democracies magicked into existence by an overeager West in the post-communist perception that history had ended. In East Timor, where he ran the UN mission, he was able to put these views into practice, with success.</p> <p>Sergio refused to criticise the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Alone among humanitarians, he was able to meet with George Bush and criticise the American treatment of detainees. He went to Baghdad in the certain expectation that his UN mission would prove to be a failure. On 19 August 2003 he died after a car bomb exploded, turning the UN headquarters into rubble. Charismatic, sexually attractive, Sergio enjoyed life and had no taste for martyrdom - he was just doing what had to be done. He died, as his biographer Samantha Power says, 'buried beneath the weight of the UN itself'. </p> <p>Sergio's last words, spoken to a rescuer eager to give him spiritual comfort, were: 'Fuck God, just get me out of here.' Human rights are indeed a matter of life and death. I can't think of a better slogan for our times than Sergio's.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> To read an edited version of the 1961 Observer article by Peter Benenson that launched Amnesty, go to <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/52o6eu\">tinyurl.com/52o6eu</a></p> <h2>The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h2> <p>This is an edited version of the rights enshrined in the 1948 declaration's 30 Articles</p> <p><strong>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.</p> <p><strong>No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.</strong></p> <p>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p> <p><strong>Everyone is equal before the law.</strong></p> <p>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.</p> <p><strong>Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the [event] of any criminal charge against him.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to privacy and to protection by the law from attacks upon his honour and reputation.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to seek asylum from persecution.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to a nationality.</strong></p> <p>Men and women, irrespective of race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and found a family.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to own property.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.</p> <p><strong>No one may be compelled to belong to an association.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.</strong></p> <p>The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government.

  "<h2>Skipton has my money. No, wait, A&amp;L has it. Oh, so has Lloyds</h2> <p>I transferred an Isa from Abbey to Alliance &amp; Leicester on 9 April. On 29 May, Abbey told me it had sent the money to the Skipton building society. Six weeks later, the Skipton confirmed that it did not have my Isa and A&amp;L confirmed that it did. But on 3 July, Lloyds TSB also said it had opened an Isa in my name with money from the Abbey. Lloyds then said the cheque had been stopped and returned to Abbey, although it was enclosed with the letter to me. <br><strong>EJ</strong></p> <p>If that had been the end of your money's tour of UK financial institutions, it would be bad enough. It's no wonder banks take so long to open Isas when they make so many mistakes. But soon after, Lloyds wrote to explain why it had refused the cheque - and confirmed that it had passed the money to Bradford &amp; Bingley! The last time you checked, your money was still safely with A&amp;L, which has credited an extra \u00a3140, presumably for lost interest. At an early stage, Abbey sent you \u00a325 but has now added another \u00a3150 to apologise for the errors.</p> <h2>They cancelled my son's card while he was abroad</h2> <p>Our son has been travelling in the Far East on his gap year, accessing his money with a Nationwide debit card. In June, Nationwide sent him a new card at our address. We phoned Nationwide who told us his existing card would cease to operate in 21 days' time. We checked again and a second person said it would continue for 99 days. We couldn't get the new card to him anyway and a third person told us that his old card would not be cancelled at all. Three weeks later, we received worried messages from our son saying he couldn't use his card and had nowhere to stay. Then that he had been mugged and, ironically, his Nationwide card stolen. We have had to send him money through the Post Office, at a cost.<br><strong>BJ, Hereford</strong></p> <p>The person you first spoke to was the only one who gave correct information. Your son's old card was valid for only 21 days once the new one had been issued. After I brought this to Nationwide's attention, it appreciated the seriousness of his situation. It offered to courier a new card to him but you decided against this as you were not sure where he would be.</p> <p>But you did agree to accept the rest of Nationwide's offer. It has paid \u00a3100 to cover your costs of sending money out to him and the cost of a hotel for one night. It sent you \u00a370 for the cost of changing his air ticket so he could return home early, and of transferring the money. If you had needed to send any more money, it would have paid for that as well. Now that he is back in the UK, Nationwide has apologised to him and offered him \u00a3150 compensation. The expiry dates on their plastic cards is another item for students to check before setting off on their gap year.</p> <h2>We don't need our old will trusts any more. Or do we?</h2> <p>My wife and I have wills with a discretionary trust exploiting the old nil-rate tax band arrangements. Now that the allowance has been doubled for couples, the need has disappeared and it would be easier if we reverted to simple wills. But might retaining the trust arrangements be potentially useful in mitigating care-home costs for the surviving spouse?<br><strong>DN, Oxford</strong></p> <p>When the first partner in a marriage or civil partnership dies, any unused part of that person's inheritance tax nil-rate band can now be transferred to the widow or widower. But it is not transferred automatically. When the second spouse dies, the executors have to prove their entitlement to the Revenue by completing pages of information and producing original documents.</p> <p>But you do not need to change your wills immediately. When the first of you dies, the survivor and trustees have two years in which to decide whether to keep the nil-rate band trust or transfer the inheritance tax allowance instead. This means you can take into account your circumstances at the time.</p> <p>There is an argument for keeping the discretionary trusts if you suspect you might need to pay for nursing care. All the money in the trust is ignored for means-testing purposes, so it is not taken into account when assessing eligibility for help paying nursing home fees. Even so, you still have access to the money in the trust, so you could use it to upgrade to a more expensive nursing home than the local authority provides.</p> <p>Each person's situation is different so do take professional advice before deciding.

For years, most recently last May, I have received 'green' letters from Standard Life advising that the plan was on target. The value if I had cashed it in last February, including early surrender penalties, was \u00a35,443. I assumed by leaving it I would get more. Now I have been told that the final value will be \u00a35,139, which is below target. Is there any point to these letters?<br><strong>PL, London</strong></p> <p>What indeed is the point of sending 'green' letters so close to maturity when they can be wrong? Standard Life says the colour-coded letters assume the plan will grow for the rest of the term at an assumed rate. It also says it was unfortunate that your plan lost value in its final six months. How can an insurer assume investments will always grow, even by a small amount, over such a short period? You suffered even more because the final bonus was slashed a month before your policy matured. Standard must have known back in May this was a possibility. Now that final bonuses are so volatile, insurers should not issue green letters in the final year.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Email Margaret Dibben at money.writes@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ and include a telephone number.

  "<h2>Letter of the week</h2> <p>My wife and I want to pack our bags and run off for a year to travel around America. I understand we will not be able to get a year's visa. Is it possible to do three months at a time then nip out to Canada or Mexico, renew our visa and then re-enter? <br><strong>Tony Harris</strong>, by email</p> <p>Check and double-check visa rules and procedures for the US, as one wrong move could see your dreams grounded. Importantly, also note that border officials have the right to refuse you entry even if your paperwork is in order. Under the terms of the Visa Waiver Programme, which allows most British travellers to enter the US without applying in advance, visitors are granted 90 days in the country. If you leave the US to visit an adjacent country (Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and Caribbean Islands) then re-enter the US, the time you were overseas counts towards your 90-day total. One solution, according to the US visa information helpline (09042 450100; calls cost \u00a31.20 a minute) is to apply for a tourist visa like nationals of other countries. A B-2 holiday visa can be valid for anything from three months to 10 years with the length of stay determined by the immigration official when you arrive. If you have firm plans in place you should secure an initial stay of six months, which may be renewable for another six. To apply for a B-2 you'll need to book an interview and pay the relevant non-refundable fee (\u00a379) - see www.usembassy.org.uk.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My partner and I want to take our two sons (who will be 13 and 11) to France next summer. The plan is to take the Eurostar to Paris, where we will spend three days seeing the sights. We want to keep our carbon footprint as small as possible, so we would like to take another train somewhere south for a seven-night 'beach' holiday. We are looking for somewhere that is easily accessible by train and close to all amenities without ending up in the French equivalent of Blackpool. We have about \u00a3100 per night to spend on accommodation. Any suggestions?<br><strong>K Whitmore</strong>, Brighton</p> <p>I asked Carolyn Boyd, Editor of France magazine (<a href=\"http://www.francemag.com\">www.francemag.com</a>) for her recommendations. First up is Arg\u00e8les-sur-Mer, near Perpignan. The beach is 2.5km from the station, but you can find a g\u00eete, holiday apartment or even camp closer to the coast. The town's tourism website (<a href=\"http://www.argeles-sur-mer.com\">www.argeles-sur-mer.com</a>) has links to accommodation. The town's family credentials are reinforced by the watersports, walking trails and summer festivals. Like everywhere on the coast, it gets very busy in summer, so book well ahead.</p> <p>Boyd also suggests Antibes for families: 'It has a great family atmosphere, with a touch of Riviera chic, while its 25km of coastline boasts fine sandy beaches and creeks. The historic old town, with its fishing harbour and world-famous Picasso connections, is great for the grown-ups, while the Marine Land theme park is a good family day out.' The Hotel Astor (00 33 4 9293 3400, <a href=\"http://www.hotel-astor1.com\">www.hotel-astor1.com</a>) in nearby Juan-les-Pins has a studio for four people that costs \u20ac88 mid-season.

I need to fly from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Antananarivo in Madagascar in March 2009, though I am fairly flexible on the date. Is there any way of doing this without going to Johannesburg? I am a student and need to keep costs down.<br><strong>Rachel James</strong>, by email</p> <p>It's still difficult to fly within Africa and from Africa to the Indian Ocean islands and costs can be high if you don't buy your ticket in conjunction with an international ticket. In many cases, the easiest route is via Europe or South Africa. However, Kenya Airways has recently started flying from Nairobi to Antananarivo and has good connections from Dar Es Salaam. Africa Travel Centre (0845 450 1520; <a href=\"http://www.africatravel.co.uk\">www.africatravel.co.uk</a>) can book this flight for \u00a3552 one-way, including taxes.</p> <p>While this option doesn't offer a huge saving on flying via Johannesburg, the flight has other advantages. Firstly, it is faster and involves fewer hours in the air. Secondly, it requires no overnight stops, leaving Dar early in the morning with a two-hour stop in Nairobi, and arrives in Madagascar in time for lunch at the excellent Sakamanga in downtown Tana (<a href=\"http://www.sakamanga.com\">www.sakamanga.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>Q </strong>Next month I will be spending 24 hours in LA. I arrive on a Monday lunchtime and fly out late Tuesday afternoon. I will not have a car and am not a theme park fan, so was wondering what recommendations you have? I was planning to stay in an airport hotel - the Custom hotel - as this would be the most practical distance-wise.<br><strong>Robert Cowie</strong>, by email </p> <p>Staying at the airport is perfect for a quick getaway, but means you'll be heading to and from the airport at least twice if you're planning Monday evening and Tuesday morning excursions into town. For this reason, you may wish to limit your excursions to neighbourhoods that are closer to the airport. A short taxi ride away is Santa Monica, perfect for a first taste of LA life, an evening beachfront stroll, a trendy drink on Ocean Avenue or Third Street Promenade. Morning options include Venice Beach, great fun for browsing the hip boutiques of Abbot-Kinney Boulevard as well as the jumble of characters, street hawkers and sun-worshippers that congregate here. Even closer to LAX, Manhattan Beach is another good neighbourhood to ramble around for a few hours. <br><strong><br>Feedback</strong></p> <p>In response to Lucy Metcalfe's request (Letters, 7 September) about cruising in the Arctic, we can highly recommend Naturetrek (<a href=\"http://www.naturetrek.co.uk\">www.naturetrek.co.uk</a>). We flew to Spitzbergen, then boarded a small ship. There were only 48 of us. We circumnavigated the islands, landing frequently in zodiacs. There was a geologist, an ornithologist, a botanist, an historian, and leader with over 20 years experience in the Arctic. We saw polar bears, arctic fox, reindeer, walrus, seal, whales and lots of birds. It was the trip of a lifetime. <br><strong>Anne Hames</strong>, by email</p> <p>You recommended (Letters, 7 September) that readers from Cardiff who wanted to go to Sydney without driving all the way up to Heathrow should fly from Bristol. In fact, there's no need as KLM fly to Sydney, via Amsterdam, from Cardiff. <br><strong>Joanne Benson</strong>, Cardiff</p>",
  "<p>A suitcase filled with $800,000 in cash has embroiled Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in a scandal which has fuelled claims of corruption and cover-up at the heart of his self-styled socialist revolution.</p> <p>A court case involving wiretaps and explosive testimony has lifted the lid on alleged attempts to buy influence across Latin America, putting Ch\u00e1vez on the defensive during a torrid week of coup rumours and expulsions of human rights critics and the US ambassador.</p> <p>Tumbling oil prices compounded the anxiety in Caracas, which is almost wholly reliant on oil revenues, and prompted the President to warn that the government would rein in its free-spending ways.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez's most immediate headache came from a federal court in Miami which heard that Venezuela tried to funnel slush money to Argentina's President, Cristina Kirchner, for her successful election campaign last year. The Presidents denounced the story, which has been front-page news in both countries, as a 'garbage' attempt by Washington to smear South America's so-called 'pink tide' of left-wing leaders.</p> <p>The story broke in August 2007 when an aircraft chartered by Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Pdvsa, landed in Buenos Aires and a customs official discovered a Venezuelan-American businessman, Guido Antonini, wheeling a suitcase containing $800,000 (\u00a3436,441). Antonini fled to Miami, where he collaborated with the FBI and said the money was clandestine funding for Kirchner's election. It is alleged that Venezuelan agents, under orders from Ch\u00e1vez and his intelligence chief, General Henry Rangel Silva, tried to buy the businessman's silence with $2m. But Antonini was wearing an FBI wire and four of the men were arrested in Miami.</p> <p>At the trial of one of them, Franklin Dur\u00e1n, who is accused of conspiracy and acting as an unauthorised agent of a foreign government, a jury heard recordings, running to 155 pages of transcripts, of the alleged plot and cover-up.</p> <p>In addition to funding his Argentine ally, it is claimed Ch\u00e1vez, raiding the bulging vaults of the state oil company, paid other governments to back Venezuela's unsuccessful bid for a UN Security Council seat in 2006. The secretly recorded conversations' breezy references to greed and shadowy deals in Ch\u00e1vez's administration have been cited by Venezuela's opposition as proof of high-level corruption. The case has been dubbed 'Maletagate', after the Spanish word for suitcase, maleta</p> <p>The unusual nature of the FBI sting and prosecution's charges prompted widespread suspicion that the trial is politicised. It has embarrassed Washington's regional rival and could wreak further damage when Antonini, the bagman, takes the stand. Ch\u00e1vez has already denounced him as a traitor.</p> <p>The revelations from Miami fed a febrile atmosphere in Caracas, which has had a dramatic 10 days. Last Thursday the government expelled two senior members from Human Rights Watch, the New York-based advocacy group, hours after they presented a damning report of Ch\u00e1vez's decade in power. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco and Daniel Wilkinson were intercepted at their hotel, escorted to the airport and put on the first outward bound flight, which was to Brazil.</p> <p>'This is further evidence of Venezuela's descent into intolerance,' said Kenneth Roth, the group's executive director. 'Ch\u00e1vez may have kicked out the messenger, but he has only reinforced the message - civil liberties in Venezuela are under attack.'</p> <p>The government accused Human Rights Watch of lying, violating visa requirements and being a front for US imperialism. Other foreign critics who committed the same offences would also be expelled, it said. 'These groups, dressed up as human rights defenders, are financed by the United States,' said the Foreign Minister, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. 'They are aligned with a policy of attacking countries that are building new economic models.'</p> <p>The move followed the banishing of the US ambassador, Patrick Duddy, for backing an alleged coup plot, prompting Washington to expel Venezuela's ambassador, Bernardo Alvarez. A similar pattern unfolded in Bolivia where President Evo Morales, a Ch\u00e1vez ally, ousted the US envoy for allegedly conspiring with the opposition to break up the country.</p> <p>Venezuelan state TV aired intercepted recordings of Venezuelan military officers apparently discussing the President's overthrow. Several were detained.</p> <p>British Ch\u00e1vez supporters picketed the US embassy in London and warned of a CIA-backed coup similar to that which toppled Salvador Allende in 1973. 'It will go to the lengths it did in Chile and will drown the revolution in blood if it gets the opportunity,' said Jeremy Dear, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists.</p> <p>The Bush administration tacitly backed a coup against Ch\u00e1vez in 2002. Since then Venezuela's leader claims to have foiled numerous similar plots. But with few details, some analysts have become sceptical.</p> <p>The latest Bolivian and Venezuelan coup claims were ploys, said Adam Isacson, of the Centre for International Policy, a Washington-based think-tank. 'Don't believe for a moment that either expulsion had anything to do with an imminent danger of aggression from a waning US administration already in way over its head in the Middle East and with Russia. We have here two leaders badly in need of an external threat to rally their domestic bases.'</p> <p>Relations with the US are set to sour further this week when Ch\u00e1vez flies to Moscow to seek fresh weapon purchases and confirm details of a visit by Russian warships to the Caribbean.</p>",

  "<p>Jorgen Tranberg looks a farmer to his roots: grubby blue overalls, crumpled T-shirt and crinkled, weather-beaten features. His laconic manner, blond hair and black clogs also reveal his Scandinavian origins. Jorgen farms at Norreskifte on Samso, a Danish island famed for its rich, sweet strawberries and delicately flavoured early potatoes. This place is steeped in history - the Vikings built ships and constructed canals here - while modern residents of Copenhagen own dozens of the island's finer houses.</p> <p>But Samso has recently undergone a remarkable transformation, one that has given it an unexpected global importance and international technological standing. Although members of a tightly knit, deeply conservative community, Samsingers - with Jorgen in the vanguard - have launched a renewable-energy revolution on this windswept scrap of Scandinavia. Solar, biomass, wind and wood-chip power generators have sprouted up across the island, while traditional fossil-fuel plants have been closed and dismantled. Nor was it hard to bring about these changes. 'For me, it has been a piece of cake,' says Jorgen. Nevertheless, the consequences have been dramatic.</p> <p>Ten years ago, islanders drew nearly all their energy from oil and petrol brought in by tankers and from coal-powered electricity transmitted to the island through a mainland cable link. Today that traffic in energy has been reversed. Samsingers now export millions of kilowatt hours of electricity from renewable energy sources to the rest of Denmark. In doing so, islanders have cut their carbon footprint by a staggering 140 per cent. And what Samso can do today, the rest of the world can achieve in the near future, it is claimed.</p> <p>Last year, carbon dioxide reached a record figure of 384 parts per million - a rise of around 35 per cent on levels that existed before the Industrial Revolution. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that such changes could soon have a dramatic impact on the world's weather patterns. Already, Arctic sea ice is dwindling alarmingly and scientists say the world has only a few years left to make serious carbon-output cuts before irreversible, devastating climate change ensues. Samso suggests one route for avoiding such a fate.</p> <p>Everywhere you travel on the island you see signs of change. There are dozens of wind turbines of various sizes dotted across the landscape, houses have solar-panelled roofs, while a long line of giant turbines off the island's southern tip swirl in the wind. Towns are linked to district heating systems that pump hot water to homes. These are either powered by rows of solar panels covering entire fields, or by generators which burn straw from local farms, or timber chips cut from the island's woods.</p> <p>None of these enterprises has been imposed by outsiders or been funded by major energy companies. Each plant is owned either by a collective of local people or by an individual islander. The Samso revolution has been an exercise in self-determination - a process in which islanders have decided to demonstrate what can be done to alleviate climate damage while still maintaining a comfortable lifestyle. </p> <p>Consider Jorgen. As he wanders round his cowsheds, he scarcely looks like an energy entrepreneur. Yet the 47-year-old farmer is a true power broker. Apart from his fields of pumpkins and potatoes, as well as his 150 cows, he has erected a giant 1 megawatt (mw) wind turbine that looms down on his 120-hectare dairy farm. Four other great machines stand beside it, swirling in Samso's relentless winds. Each device is owned either by a neighbouring farmer or by a collective of locals. In addition, Jorgen has bought a half share in an even bigger, 2.3mw generator, one of the 10 devices that guard the south coast of Samso and now help to supply a sizeable chunk of Denmark's electricity.</p> <p>The people of Samso were once the producers of more than 45,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year - about 11 tonnes a head. Through projects like these, they have cut that figure to -15,000. (That strange minus figure comes from the fact that Samsingers export their excess wind power to mainland Denmark, where it replaces electricity that would otherwise be generated using coal or gas.) It is a remarkable transformation, wrought mainly by Samsingers themselves, albeit with the aid of some national and European Union funds and some generous, guaranteed fixed prices that Denmark provides for wind-derived electricity. The latter ensures turbines pay for themselves over a six- or seven-year period. After that, owners can expect to rake in some tidy profits.</p> <p>'It has been a very good investment,' admits Jorgen. 'It has made my bank manager very happy. But none of us is in it just for the money. We are doing it because it is fun and it makes us feel good.' Nor do his efforts stop with his turbines. Jorgen recently redesigned his cowshed so it requires little straw for bedding for his cattle. Each animal now has its own natty mattress. Instead, most of the straw from Jorgen's fields is sold to his local district heating plant, further increasing his revenue and limiting carbon dioxide production. (Carbon dioxide is absorbed as crops grow in fields. When their stalks - straw - are burned, that carbon dioxide is released, but only as a gas that has been recycled within a single growing season. By contrast, oil, coal and gas are the remains of plants that are millions of years old and so, when burned, release carbon dioxide that had been sequestered aeons ago.)</p> <p>Samso's transformation owes its origin to a 1997 experiment by the Danish government. Four islands, Laeso, Samso, Aero and Mon, as well as the region of Thyholm in Jutland, were each asked to compete in putting up the most convincing plan to cut their carbon outputs and boost their renewable-energy generation. Samso won. </p> <p>Although it lies at the heart of Denmark, the nation's fractured geography also ensures the island is one of its most awkward places to reach, surrounded as it is by the Kattegat, an inlet of the North Sea. To get to Samso from Copenhagen, you have to travel by train for a couple of hours to Kalundborg and then take one of the twice daily ferries to Samso. A total of 4,100 people live here, working on farms or in hotels and restaurants. The place is isolated and compact and ideal for an experiment in community politics and energy engineering - particularly as it is low-lying and windswept. Flags never droop on Samso.</p> <p>The job of setting up the Samso experiment fell to Soren Harmensen, a former environmental studies teacher, with thinning greyish hair and an infectious enthusiasm for all things renewable. Outside his project's headquarters, at the Samso Energiakademi - a stylish, barn-like building designed to cut energy consumption to an absolute minimum - there is an old, rusting petrol pump parked on the front steps. A label on it says, simply: 'No fuel. So what now, my love?' Step inside and you will find no shortage of answers to that question. </p> <p>Soren is a proselytiser and proud of his island's success. However, achieving it was not an easy matter. It took endless meetings to get things started. Every time there was a community issue at stake, he would arrive and preach his sermon about renewable energy and its value to the island. Slowly, the idea took hold and eventually public meetings were held purely to discuss his energy schemes. Even then, the process was erratic, with individual islanders' self-interest triggering conflicts. One Samsinger, the owner of a cement factory, proposed a nuclear plant be built on the island instead of wind turbines. He would then secure the concrete contract for the reactor, he reasoned. The plan was quietly vetoed.</p> <p>'We are not hippies,' says Soren. 'We just want to change how we use our energy without harming the planet or without giving up the good life.'</p> <p>Eventually the first projects were launched, a couple of turbines on the west coast, and a district heating plant. 'Nothing was achieved without talk and a great deal of community involvement,' says Soren, a message he has since carried round the planet. 'I visited Shropshire recently,' he says. 'A wind-farm project there was causing a huge fuss, in particular among the three villages nearest the proposed site. The planners would soothe the objections of one village, only for the other two to get angry - so local officials would turn to them. Then the first village started to object all over again. The solution was simple, of course. Give each village a turbine, I told them. The prospect of cheap electricity would have changed everyone's minds.' Needless to say, this did not happen.</p> <p>On another visit - this time to Islay, off the west coast of Scotland - Soren found similar problems. 'I was asked to attend a public meeting to debate the idea of turning the island into a renewable energy centre like Samso. But nearly all the speakers droned on about ideals and about climate change in general. But what people really want is to be involved themselves and to do something that can make a difference to the world. That point was entirely lost.</p> <p>'Later I found that a local Islay distillery was installing a new set of boilers. Why not use the excess water to heat local homes, I suggested. That would be far too much bother, I was told. Yet that was just the kind of scheme that could kick-start a renewable-energy revolution.'</p> <p>Of course, there is something irritating about this Scandinavian certainty. Not every community is as cohesive as Samso's, for one thing. And it should also be noted that the island's transformation has come at a price: roughly 420m kroner - about \u00a340m - that includes money from the Danish government, the EU, local businessmen and individual members of collectives. Thus the Samso revolution cost around \u00a310,000 per islander, although a good chunk has come from each person's own pockets. Nevertheless, if you multiply that sum by 60m - the population of Great Britain - you get a figure of around \u00a3600bn as the cost of bringing a similar revolution to Britain. It is utterly impractical, of course - a point happily acknowledged by Soren.</p> <p>'This is a pilot project to show the world what can be done. We are not suggesting everyone makes the sweeping changes that we have. People should cherry pick from what we have done in order to make modest, but still meaningful carbon emission cuts. The crucial point is that we have shown that if you want to change how we generate energy, you have to start at the community level and not impose technology on people. For example, Shell heard about what we were doing and asked to be involved - but only on condition they ended up owning the turbines. We told them to go away. We are a nation of farmers, of course. We believe in self-sufficiency.'</p> <p>Jesper Kjems was a freelance journalist based in Copenhagen when he and his wife came to Samso for a holiday four years ago. They fell in love with the island and moved in a few months later, although neither had jobs. Jesper started playing in a local band and met Soren Harmensen, its bassist, who sold him the Samso energy dream. Today Jesper is official spokesman for the Samso project. </p> <p>Outside the town of Nordby, he showed me round its district heating project. A field has been covered with solar panels mounted to face the sun. Cold water is pumped in at one end to emerge, even on a gloomy day, as seriously hot water - around 70C - which is then piped to local houses for heating and washing. On particularly dark, sunless days, the plant switches mode: wood chips are scooped by robot crane into a furnace which heats the plant's water instead. The entire system is completely automated. 'There are some living creatures involved, however,' adds Jesper. 'A flock of sheep is sent into the field every few days to nibble the grass before it grows long enough to prevent the sun's rays hitting the panels.'</p> <p>Everywhere you go, you find renewable- energy enthusiasts like Jesper. Crucially, most of them are recent recruits to the cause. Nor do planning rows concerning the sight of 'eyesore' wind turbines affect Samsingers as they do Britons. 'No one minds wind turbines on Samso for the simple reason that we all own a share of one,' says electrician Brian Kjar.</p> <p>And that is the real lesson from Samso. What has happened here is a social not a technological revolution. Indeed, it was a specific requirement of the scheme, when established, that only existing, off-the-shelf renewable technology be used. The real changes have been those in attitude. Brian's house near the southern town of Orby reveals the consequences. He has his own wind turbine, which he bought second-hand for \u00a316,000 - about a fifth of its original price. This produces more electricity than his household needs, so he uses the excess to heat water that he keeps in a huge insulated tank that he also built himself. On Samso's occasional windless days, this provides heating for his home when the 70ft turbine outside his house is not moving. </p> <p>'Everyone knows someone who is interested in renewable energy today,' he adds. 'Something like this starts with a few people. It just needs time to spread. That is the real lesson of Samso.'</p>",

Livia knows how to fillet a fish on the plate in a second. If we are having fish, everybody's plate looks like a train wreck except hers.</p> <p>The nouvelle stuff really gets up my nose. I've never liked the way you end up with a sphincter of pigeon with a raspberry reduction. I am very rarely satisfied by the idea of quality being enough. If I like something I want more of it.</p> <p>My parents grew up in India. I love cooking and I can do Indian food. It's my party piece though it is very hard to get it right. My grandfather was a butcher-turned-doctor - make of that what you will - so there was always lots of meat around. But I was very put off meat as a kid, probably because of the crappy, gristly stuff we got served at school in the Sixties. You had to sit there until you finished your food. We were always being reminded of 'the starving people in Africa'. I remember thinking at the time that even they wouldn't eat this. I'd leave the dining hall with a pocketful of sausages and tinned peas. I preferred it being there than in my stomach.</p> <p>The oddest food I have ever eaten was in Japan. I'm fairly adventurous, though some of the things were a bit of a challenge to my imagination. I managed the raw baby eels OK. I didn't have the blowfish and I turned down the offer of whale. On the last day I really needed a pizza. But I was given something that looked like a small white brain which turned out to be the raw intestines of a fish and it was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to swallow.</p> <p>Film-location catering has improved a bit. I really do object to being served shit. In America there are no problems at all. They won't look at you askance if you ask for an egg-white omelette. Here you still have a macho culture but you don't have to eat school food any more. Weight-wise, I'm quite fortunate - until I was 35 I could eat anything and not put on an ounce. Now I exercise quite a bit. I've become keen on cycling though I don't go to the gym. </p> <p>I'm spared a sweet tooth. I'm the killjoy at moments when everyone goes off for ice cream. I am not inclined towards fast food though I used to love it. I can't remember the last time I had a McDonald's. Your body tells you what's good and what isn't. It's like having bad sex with someone you shouldn't.

  "<p><strong>Metallica</strong> <br>O2 Arena, London SE10</p> <p>Think of an intimate, fan-club-only album launch party, and you might picture a cramped club with sweat raining off the low ceiling on to the lucky few. Not so with Metallica, 27-year-old Danish-Californian rock monoliths. Their fan club easily fills the O2 Arena. When the band arrive on stage, 20,000 people begin roaring and barely let up for two hours. </p> <p>By this gargantuan band's touring standards, this gig is actually a radically scaled-back affair. Billed as a party in honour of the release of their No 1 album Death Magnetic, this show has no stage set, save a spine of amps; few theatrics, no video screens, or any of the pyrotechnics that traditionally light up Metallica shows. When I saw them at Earls Court in 1996, by contrast, stunt men on fire ran amok and the stage pretended to collapse. Tonight, singing guitarist James Hetfield struts about on the amps; lead guitarist Kirk Hammett does too. That's about it. When, midway through a closing 'Seek and Destroy', the band unleash their only bit of stagecraft - dozens of giant black Metallica beach balls - the delight is universal.</p> <p>Metallica have done many fan-club shows before, but this one feels like a particularly chummy love-in at a pivotal time for the band. It is the culmination of a charm offensive aimed at changing the widespread (and rather accurate) view of Metallica as internet-hating rich men lashing out at a changing world. </p> <p>In 2000, the band sued Napster, contributing to the site's downfall and alienating a generation of file-sharing fans. A string of relatively under-par albums (Load, ReLoad, S&amp;M) added to the band's woes. A move towards transparency nearly backfired when the documentary Some Kind of Monster showed the warring metallers undergoing group therapy while making their least-loved album, St Anger.</p> <p>Metallica are desperate not to be seen as control freaks, misers and bullies any more, and so Death Magnetic has come trumpeted by a fly-on-the-wall promotional website; and every track is available to download as part of Guitar Hero III, the video game which takes air guitar to new virtual heights. Their mission to rekindle favour stops just short of personal band lap dances and free ice cream.</p> <p>They do give away a hell of a lot of guitar picks, mind. To make the front row as generous as possible, the band play in the round tonight, with eight microphones strategically positioned to allow Hetfield to commune with his acolytes at every point of the compass. Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo are also free-ranging, while drummer Lars Ulrich's kit revolves from north to south throughout the set, providing us with the rarely seen view of a drummer's backside. Ulrich wanders around almost as much as he sits, spitting water on grateful fans.</p> <p>The 17-song set borrows a reasonable five songs from their new album, alongside a generous dose of older, thrashier songs. Lightweight fans such as myself definitely miss their greatest hit, 'Enter Sandman', but otherwise, the pummelling stays just on the right side of heavy, and the ballads don't take up too much valuable riffing time.</p> <p>There aren't usually many innovations at a Metallica gig, but it is refreshing to hear an audible bass on 'The End of the Line'. 'Cyanide', meanwhile, sounds as good live as it did at the Death Magnetic album playback. As well as beating Scots hopefuls Glasvegas to the No 1 spot, Death Magnetic has been well-received critically, suggesting Metallica's hard work (and back-to-basics approach) has reaped dividends. Later in the set, 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' and 'Master of Puppets' are blasts from the past whose aggression remains evergreen.</p> <p>For all this, fans part with just \u00a35, the proceeds of which go to the Youth Music charity. The band's charm offensive even stretches to Hetfield, so often a brooding presence. He may be a strapping figure covered in tattoos, but when he opens his mouth, the statuesque former alcoholic is surprisingly Californian and easy-going. 'Put your phones away, man,' he cajoles amiably. 'Putting a two-minute video of Metallica on YouTube isn't going to make you famous. Just enjoy the show.' </p> <p>When, at the end, the band hang around for a quarter of an hour, distributing drumsticks and guitar picks, the warmth in the arena is convincing. It is common form for bands to thank their fans volubly, but there is a new humility in this band's attitude that suggests that while these metal overlords broadcast at immense volumes, they can listen, too.</p>",

Thomas quickly <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared-gen/ap/National/Ike.html\">reversed her decision</a>, leaving thousands of her constituents parked on the highway waiting to enter, justifiably irate.</p> <p>The next day she was <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6007333.html\">reduced to tears</a> during a meeting of the remnants of the Galveston city council when a council member <a href=\"http://www.galvnews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=1a4a1627b84941fd&amp;-session=TheDailyNews:42F9480F166a005616LJj2526E0A\">accused Thomas of showing favouritism</a> by allowing a selected few to return to the island and providing essential services such as tetanus shots to city employees while denying them to residents that remained on the island.</p> <p>There are some things that have changed about hurricanes in recent years. Hurricane Katrina hangs over the head of every coastal area politician. Nobody wants to be the next Ray Nagin (the mayor of New Orleans), Kathleen Blanco (the former governor of Louisiana) or George Bush. Even Bush doesn't want to be Bush. He took to the airwaves last Saturday morning to send a message that he was aware that a hurricane had struck the fourth largest city in the country.</p> <p>For his efforts, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) remains the whipping boy for everything that goes wrong in the aftermath of the storm. <a href=\"http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7012296762\">\"Blame Fema\"</a> is the new post-hurricane mantra. I didn't even know Fema existed as a child. Prior to Katrina, most Americans likely didn't know what Fema did, and apparently some local officials still don't know.</p> <p>Despite news reports to the contrary, most Texans aren't relying on Fema. They are relying instead on what we have always relied on in hurricane country: the FFEMA, the Family and Friends Emergency Management Agency.</p> <p>Our family disaster response swung into action when I got the call from my mother at 7:00am a week ago. Jefferson County officials had <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d9b78b4-8064-11dd-99a9-000077b07658.html\">ordered a mandatory evacuation</a> of my hometown in southeast Texas. My parents and extended family hadn't bothered to unpack from their evacuation for Hurricane Gustav a little over a week earlier. My mother wanted to head west toward me, but ended up heading north.</p> <p>After that initial call, as is typical, the cell phone circuits were jammed and calls could not go through. Text messages became the only reliable means of communication. My parents didn't know how to text message, however. My sister on the east coast sent me a text the following morning that, after travelling overnight, my parents and assorted extended relatives had finally reached Arlington, Texas, where they were near family.</p> <p>My two sisters who live in Houston messaged that they had decided to ride the storm out. My sister in the suburbs north of Houston lost an oak tree, but they survived Ike with no major structural damage. After a day and a half without electricity however, the novelty of playing board games in the dark got old, and they messaged that they were coming to stay with me in Austin.</p> <p>Like my family, most people aren't waiting around for the federal or state government. They are clearing their streets, creating their own rudimentary power grids by draping extension cords across streets and driveways to <a href=\"http://www.nwanews.com/adg/News/237587/\">share electricity with neighbours</a>. Family members in unaffected areas are driving into town with coolers full of ices and five-gallon gasoline canisters strapped to roofs of cars and SUVs. It was a bit disconcerting driving on I-35 watching an SUV with six full five-gallon gas canisters strapped on top. Is that safe?</p> <p>People are doing what they have always done after major storms, they are adapting to the situation. Which is why I taught my 60-something-year-old mother how to text message on Sunday when I drove to check on them at their hotel in north Texas. Cell phone companies can provide GPS, internet service and picture mail, but they haven't quite figured out how to cope with all of the families and friends who clamour for contact with each other in times of disaster.</p> <p>Mama figured it out in about three minutes. In her exuberance in sending and receiving messages I had to caution her that text messaging is not part of her cellular plan. Her newly discovered modern day Morse code was probably costing her $0.15 a message. She didn't appear to care. Contact with the outside world was more than worth it.</p> <p><em>This is the second of a two-part article on the aftermath of Hurricane Ike in Texas.

  "<p>Pakistan's new president today said that his country cannot accept violations of its sovereignty \"by any power\", in a clear warning to the US over recent cross-border military strikes.</p> <p>Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of the assassinated former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, has faced mounting anger within the country following a series of American missile attacks and ground assaults in Pakistan's north-west tribal regions, near the Afghan border.</p> <p>\"We will not tolerate the violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity by any power in the name of combating terrorism,\" he told the parliament in Islamabad today.</p> <p>Zardari won a vote for the presidency earlier this month after the previous president and close US ally, Pervez Musharraf, quit under threat of impeachment. The new incumbent is also considered generally pro-American but has faced criticism for not responding to the US raids.</p> <p>On Wednesday, at least six people were killed after an unmanned US drone aircraft fired missiles at a suspected militant hideout in a village in Pakistan's South Waziristan region.

This is always my favourite moment of my favourite sporting event; each side has shown their colours, but there are enough points left to be won that no conclusions can be drawn yet. </p> <p>At the moment, the momentum is firmly with the US, after they twice overcame strong starts from their opponents to win the opening session for the first time since 1991 and lead the opening day for the first time since 1995. They are thriving on their underdog status and yesterday's play was characterised by determined performances from the hosts and partisan whooping and hollering from a fired-up crowd. <strong>This is going to be great.</strong> </p> <p>So the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf3\">big news </a>is that Europe captain Nick Faldo has omitted <strong>Sergio Garcia</strong> and <strong>Lee Westwood</strong> from the foursomes line-up. </p> <p>That's Sergio Garcia, vastly experienced and wildly enthusiastic Ryder Cup player, three times a winner and with a record of W8 D1 L0 in the foursomes. And Lee Westwood, another totemic player with bags of experience in this tournament and the joint record-holder for most successive Ryder Cup games without defeat. That's a record he shares with Arnold Palmer.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>12.05pm BST Three reasons for Europe to be worried</strong><br><strong>Phil Mickelson is owning it</strong> In the absence of the Other Guy, Lefty has been playing out of his skin so far and is easily the Americans' strongest players so far. Twice he battled with Padraig Harrington yesterday and both times he clawed back deficits to end with 1 1/2 points to the Irishman's 1/2. His putting in particular was superb. with a 70-footer on the 12th perhaps the shot of the day. No European will look forward to taking him on today. Least of all rookie Oliver Wilson.</p> <p><strong>It's all a conspiracy</strong> The alickadoos of the European PGA Tour, concerned that continued tonkings would make the Americans take their golf ball and stalk off home in a huff, have met in the smoking room of a leading Parisian hotel (the USPGA meet in underground car parks) to cunningly engineer defeat for their own boys. Concerned that the American would just stop turning up for the Ryder Cup in order to focus on the shiny new President's Cup instead, the Europeans have chucked out Monty and Darren Clarke and appointed Faldo, a man who can't even get a lunch order in without making himself look stupid.</p> <p><strong>They are not winning</strong> In the Ryder Cup, as in may sporting events, the team with the most points takes the trophy, the plaudits and the girls. Currently that team is not Europe. Over the past two decades, the Europeans have generally led over the first two days, excelling in the foursomes and the fourballs while the Americans bark at each other and snap their putters in frustration. The tie then comes down to how well Europe holds that lead in the singles. This time however, the US take a healthy lead into the second day.</p> <p><strong>One reason for Europe to be cheerful</strong><br>They only need a draw.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.15pm BST While you're waiting</strong> Find out what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf1\">Richard Williams thinks of the whole schemozzle</a> and why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf\">Lawrence Donegan is not warming to Boo Weekley. </a>Have a gander at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf6\">Sean Ingle's morning session minute-by-minute</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf7\">Scott Murray's equally minute-by-minute afternoon report</a> for every pitch, play and USA! of yesterday's play.</p> <p>And speaking of Murray, check out his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/18/rydercup.thejoyofsix\">top six Ryder Cup moments ever ever ever</a> and when you are finished, scroll to the comments and tell him why he couldn't be more wrong and that you expected better from the Guardian. Finish by asking him does he get paid for this tosh.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12.35pm BST</strong> Half and hour to go. On Sky right now, one of Europe's most winningest Ryder Cup heroes ever, Tony Jacklin, is bemoaning the raucous cheering of the American galleries. Unsurprisingly, really.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>12.40pm BST Prediction time </strong>I'm not contractually obliged to do this, so I am now unnecessarily risking making myself look foolish in the future. However, that has never stopped me in the past. I think Europe will make another strong start, except in the Mickelson/Kim v Wilson/Stenson match and then go on to hold that lead for a 2 1/2 to 1 1/2 session win.</p> <p>Having said that, expect Lefty to hurl his nine-iron into the galleries after five holes of stinking up the joint and Europe to slump to 5&amp;4 defeats in the other three matches.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12.45pm BST</strong> <strong>In the interests of journalistic impartiality</strong>, I should disclose that I am, in fact, a <strong>European</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12.46pm BST</strong> <em>taps watch impatiently</em> Where is Naylor?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12.48pm BST</strong> Ah, here we are. And conveniently he is addressing a topic to which I was about to turn my attention.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of hand-wringing over Boo Weekley geeing up the crowd. I find this a bit rich really. Golfers are (correctly) lauded for playing their game very close to, sometimes from within, the spectators, always able to concentrate on the matter at hand. Once the golfer is into his preparation, the crowd must desist from cheering, but until then, the crowd should be free to do what they want short of personal abuse even if the hole isn't yet decided. That's the dynamic of team sport crowd behaviour - the best players turn it to their advantage, home or away.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12.50pm BST Newsflash</strong> Padraig Harrington has an international award for Irish dancing. And Robert Karlsson is not particularly interesting.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12.52pm BST</strong> Boo Weekley and Paul Azinger have taken the most flak for geeing up the crowd, Weekley in particular for doing so before his opponent Lee Westwood had taken his shot. </p> <p>I mean, really. This is <em>America</em>. What did you expect? Rattle your jewellery?</p> <p>Here's Lee Westwood on Boo Weekley (who incidentally is named after Boo-Boo the bear). \"You walk a fine line when you use the crowd to your advantage that way. You can do it by playing good golf, but you can go too far when you are waving your arms around. At the 13th hole I still had a putt for a half \u2013 there's no need to do it between shots, at least wait until you're walking off the green, I don't mind that. The game was slow enough as it was. I thought we were never going to get finished.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.05pm BST \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second day's morning matches of the 37th Ryder Cup.\"</strong> It's Ian 'Teacher's Pet' Poulter and his good buddy Justin Rose who will tee it up first for Europe and the dastardly colonials in their way are Stewart Cink and Chad Campbell.</p> <p>Today's action will be inevitably be viewed with the omission of Garcia and Westwood in the back of everyone's minds. Way to make yourself inconspicuous, Nick.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.06pm BST</strong> Rose tees up. No pressure.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.06pm BST</strong> Rose lamps it down the fairway. Fantastic shot. Campbell follows suit but is unlucky to see it just nestle off the verge of the fairway.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.10pm BST </strong>Sigh. Commercial break. To be fair to Sky, it is just two preposterously dressed young men walking through a manicured lawn. </p> <p>Gary Naylor, fashionista. \"It's almost impossible to believe with <a href=\"http://www.virginmedia.com/images/lehman.jpg\">form</a> like thisbut the American team is dressed soberly, even tastefully, whereas the Europeans appear to have come directly from an ice-cream salesmen's conference.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.13pm BST</strong> Poulter is 113yds from the pin, on a still morning. Spectacular! He plants it right up there and it so nearly goes in. He's within two feet and gets the concession.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.14pm BST </strong>Campbell has a holeable, but very difficult, shot for the half from just above the green and he does pretty well too, but it's first blood to Poulter and Rose.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.16pm BST</strong> It's Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan against Miguel Angel Jimenez and Graeme McDowell on the first tee box now. Never mind Yankee razzmatazz, there is a sizeable contingent of Irish fans there who are easily more boisterous than anyone else. I know they are Irish because they are singing \"You'll never beat the Irish\" and wearing those ridiculous leprechaun outfits. Oh, lads.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.19pm BST</strong> Poulter leaves an excellent drive just right off the fairway, which Cink cannot match. He leaves it somewhere in the next state. That's filth. Ouch. According to Sky's man on the course that is \"the one place you must not go.\" Good chance for the English pair to go two up.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.21pm BST</strong> Leonard's opening drive bounces high off the fairway, over the ropes and .... aaargh. Jimenez is in much better shape. Go team!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.24pm BST</strong> Campbell is now onto his third shot, the Americans having taken a water hazard. He does well, but not nearly well enough given the position of Poulter and Rose.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.30pm BST</strong>Justin Rose lifts it high and clean to within two or three feet of the green. In the other game Jimenez is on the dancefloor, with a reasonably challenging putt of 10ft or so.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.32pm BST</strong> McDowell now to put Europe up in the second match. Oh, so close! Great start from him and Jimenez. In the top match, Poulter and Rose can two putt to win the hole.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.33pm BST </strong>Poulter's line is perfect but he is just short. The Amricans get up and down for a half in the other match, so that's all square.</p> <p>Campbell misses his 10 foot putt and gives Rose the gimme. It's<strong> two from two</strong> for Europe.</p> <p>Early scoreboard:<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 2UP</strong> (2)<br>Leonard/Mahan A/S v Jimenez/McDowell (1)<br>Mickelson/Kim v Stenson/Wilson (1.35pm)<br>Furyk/Perry v Harrington/Karlsson (1.50pm)</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>1.35pm BST </strong>Oliver Wilson strikes his first Ryder Cup shot. And it's a good 'un. A bit too wide perhaps. He's playing with Henrik Stenson against Phil Mickelson and Anthony Kim. Lefty is spot on from the tee. Huge cheers, fist pumps, USA! USA!, etc.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.42pm BST </strong>Poulter from the bunker on the third green, slides it just past the hole. The US boys are in a good spot for a birdie though.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.44pm BST</strong> Cink misses his birdie putt and Rose gets his for par. All square at the third and that was a good escape from Europe to hold their lead. Mickelson is putting from 12ft or so with Europe sitting 4ft closer. He misses, just.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>1.46pm BST </strong>More calls of \"You'll never beat the Irish\" as Harrington and Karlsson approach the first tee, with Jim Furyk and Kenny Perry in tow. And Wilson so very nearly gets the birdie on his very first Ryder Cup hole. He doesn't, and neither does Mickelson, so no change there.</p> <p>McDowell, meanwhile leaves Jimenez a very gettable six foot putt - and he gets it. The US should make par though, and they do. Still all square.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>1.49pm BST </strong><br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 2UP</strong> (3)<br>Leonard/Mahan A/S v Jiminez/McDowell (2)<br>Mickelson/Kim A/S Stenson/Wilson (1)<br>Furyk/Perry v Harrington/Karlsson (1.50pm)</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>1.51pm BST </strong> Harrington cannot match his colleagues' efforts. It's in the trees and all over the place. Dagger eyes from Karlsson as he trudges into the crowd. In a curiously stubborn move, Furyk reckons anything Harrington can do he can do better, and smacks it into the galleries.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>1.54pm BST </strong>Cink sits over a right little doozy on the fourth. His lie looks to be sloping down and left. Poulter has a much easier one to follow. And Cink can't quite make it; it's long and wide. Karlsson is lost in the woods.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>1.54pm BST </strong><br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 3UP</strong> (4)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jiminez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (3)<br>Mickelson/Kim A/S v Stenson/Wilson (1)<br>Furyk/Perry v Harrington/Karlsson (1.50pm)</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.01pm BST</strong><strong> Europe leading in two matches</strong></p> <p>After Cink's miss, Poulter sinks his easily to go three up, and surely Faldo cannot suppress a smug smile at this stage. And right behind them Leonard hits a super chip that sneaks in the back but it's <strong>all in vain </strong>as they have already taken a drop and Europe can two-putt for the win. Jimenez needs them both but the second one is inches away conceded.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.06pm BST</strong> Drat! Karlsson couldn't make good on Harrington's wayward drive, leaving it right. Harrington in turn gives him a long straight put to save the half, but he can't make it. <strong>So the US take a lead in a match for the first time today. </strong></p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.07pm BST</strong> It's a mixture of poor play from Cink and Campbell and storming efficiency from Rose and Poulter, but the latter are now four up. Again, it was the approach shot that let the Americans down.</p> <p>But alas, Mickelson amd Kim are in equally fine form and they are now two up. It's a super putt from Kim on the third that his opponents have no reply to, after Stenson had given Wilson way too much to do on the previous hole.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (5)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jiminez/McDowell 2UP</strong> (4)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 2UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (3)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 1UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (1)</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.14pm BST </strong>Back in the bottom pairing and Karlsson outdrives Perry, both landing square in the middle of the fairway. But the advantage swings back to the US; Furyk takes the wedge for the lofted green and draws the necessary hollers from the crowd before Padraig \"three out of the last six majors\" Harrington leaves his edge shot much too short. Silence from the galleries. Harrington has not so far matched his superb play from yesterday, but it's still early.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2.17pmBST </strong><strong> Controversy from Naylor </strong> \"Does Kentucky sanction gay marriages?\" I couldn't say, Gary, but I imagine very much no. \"The way the commentators are going on, we can expect Mickelson and Kim to make an announcement any day now.\"</p> <p>And he;s right, they are easily the smiliest pair out there, playing smooth, intuitive golf that only Poulter and Rose can come close to matching. At this stage, it looks like the day will be decided in the other pairings.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.21pm BST</strong> Oh dear. Perry holes a real dribbler, with the crowd blowing it in. That's two up for them and I imagine more dagger eyes for Harrington after he left his partner with a lot to do for the putt.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>2.22pm BST </strong>It's that man Kim again with a birdie putt. You know the drill; perfect lie, perfect putt, fist pump, chanting. He and Mickelson go three up. There are a lot of comparisons made between Kim's putting and Woods' and I have to say it's not too ridiculous a claim. He and Lefty really do look like they are out for a stroll on Captain's Day.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (5)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 2UP</strong> (4)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 3UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (4)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (2)</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>2.26pm </strong>McDowell is in trouble, but not terribly so. It's over the brook and onto a sharply sloping green at the fifth. He gets the distance and leaves it just off the green. That'll be par at best for Europe.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2.30pm BST</strong>Harrington and Karlsson get a let-off at the third. They have a similar lie and Karlsson goes first, making an absolute hash of it. But even with the advantage of watching the Swede's lie, Perry drills it down and wide. Still two up for the USA. </p> <p>And there's a kerplunk! up ahead. Cink and Campbell in trouble.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>2.33pm BST </strong>Harrington with the lob wedge from the sand, about 92yds. Very difficult shot after a duff drive from Karlsson. He gets the spin on the back of the green but really these guys need to get it together, and quickly.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.35pm BST </strong>That was Cink who found the water (again) and that will surely be five down. Given his opponent's position, Poulter takes no chances and he lifts it to the back of the green, in light rough.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.37pm BST </strong>McDowell <em>just </em> misses that par on the fifth. It was a difficult ask from about ten feet and he rolls it around the cup.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.42pm BST </strong>Perry makes up for that stinker on the last green with a lovely putt that send the crowd crazy. He needed that after some poor work on the greens all day.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Leonard has taken advantage of McDowell's miss to take par and the hole. In the space of a minute it's two holes to the US and the crowd can scent blood. </p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (6)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 2UP</strong> (6)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 3UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (5)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 3UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (4)</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.43pm BST </strong>Thankfully for Faldo's men, Cink and Campbell are still shambling about and after six wayward hacks they concede the hole. If the European captain was hoping for his poster boys Rose and Poulter to lead the way for Europe, then they have delivered in spades. <strong>They are five up through seven.</strong></p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.43pm BST </strong>Wilson is down in sloping rough on the sixth but he must be confident of his lie because he simply lamps it up and over across the fairway, from where it rolls back down into a reasonably good position. For Stenson and Wilson though it really does look like damage limitation though, given Mickelson and Kim's brilliance.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.47pm BST</strong>Oh, Padraig! I can hardly look. Another poor drive, and he really is way off the pace compared to yesterday. And given that he only managed a half point yesterday, that really is bad news. It's Karlsson from the bunker and he stabs it up to the fairway, sort of. Best he could do with a horrible lie.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.50pm BST</strong> A scrambling half for Cink and they remain five down. But Wilson misses a relatively simple putt at the seventh and that would have been such a confidence booster for the rookie. That would have been for a half, so they are now four down. </p> <p>In an unsurprising turn of events, Karlsson and Harrington have lost another hole, and yet again that was the Irishman's fault. </p> <p>And this is where we're at:<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 5UP</strong> (8)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (6)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 4UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (6)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 4UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (5)</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>2.54pm BST</strong> Rose finds the rough from the eighth tee, but it's a gentle kind of rough and Poulter won't sweat it too much. These guys look like they want to be home and hosed by the 12th or 13th. </p> <p>Jimenez is unlucky there, a fine sweeping putt around to the right. That would have won the hole - but what's this! Calamity from Mahan and the US take a six. <strong>That's 2 up to Jimenez and McDowell in the only game really up for grabs right now. </strong></p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.00pm BST</strong> <strong>It's quite a different day from yesterday.</strong> Each match, apart from perhaps the second, is looking won already and there hasn't been a sniff of a chance that any of the strugglers might swing the match back their way. In contrast yesterday saw the lead change hands several times. </p> <p>Naylor has just sent me a simply dreadful smutty pun that I will be forced to print unless i get an e-mail from someone else. <strong>Believe me, it's in your interest.</strong></p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>3.04pm BST</strong> Leonard has a putt to win the hole and take their match with McDowell and Jimenez back to one down. He dinks it home oh-so-slowly, surely toying with his opponents and the crowd. The US are winning this hands down on the greens. And on the fairway. And from the rough, etc and so on.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.08pm BST</strong> Oh, hooray! Big PH (as I once heard a particularly obnoxious Portmarnock clubman refer to Harrington, as if he had known him since their pitch and putt days) has holed and Furyk has not. <strong>That's back to 3 up for Furyk and Perry.</strong></p> <p>If Europe are to start clawing back the Americans' lead, they <em>must</em> win this match. Wilson and Stenson have far too much to do. Karlsson had had a respectable season and Harrington is Europe's most highly-ranked player. And their only major winner.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.14pm BST </strong>McDowell hits a poor approach to the wrong side of the green, and Jimenez will do well to leave his partner a simple putt, let alone hole it himself.</p> <p>My successful attempt to jinx Kim and Mickelson has worked, they are in trouble on the eighth. And Perry is in the water! It's all kicking off. If indeed golf ever does 'kick off'.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 5UP</strong> (9)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (7)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 3UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (6)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 3UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (6)</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.17pm BST</strong> It's Harrington now, going across the water that Perry couldn't clear. He needs to get it high and right. He lays up, but Karlsson will take their third from roughly the same spot that Furyk will hit the American's sixth. Furyk does well; the putt for five is definitely on.</p> <p>All square at the ninth for McDowell/Jimenez and Leonard/Mahan. They reach the turn with Europe one up.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.21pm BST</strong> Cink and Campbell were 39 out; four over and no birdies. Yikes.</p> <p>Karlsson and Harrington continue to play safe, Harrington is about 65 yards away and will need the lob wedge to clear the front edge.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.22pm BST</strong> <strong>Quick dash over to Wilson and Stenson.</strong> Following my needless pontification at 3.08pm, the American pair have seen their lead slashed to two holes. Europe took the seventh when Kim found himself deep in rough and couldn't find a way out, and Mickelson's poor salvage effort from a bunker at the eighth gave Kim a tough 15ft putt that he rolled wide. <br><strong><br>And behind them it's more good news for Europe.</strong> Furyk gives Perry a chance from about 12ft, which he takes in smashing fashion. He couldn't buy a putt earlier. But it's a wasted effort, Karlsson holes to cut it back to two holes between them.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.30pm BST</strong> Laurence Slater is not entirely impressed with the European front pair's performance. </p> <p>\"In the midst of the carnage in the first group it seems to me that Justin Rose has actually played quite badly. This is being masked because Cink and Campbell have played particularly badly and Poulter has played really well.\" </p> <p>Well?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.33pm BST </strong>That is the nature of foursomes though; you can carry your partner or drag him down into the stinking mire with you. Poulter and Rose benefit from being close friends and perhaps Rose also benefits from Poulter being a more flamboyant character, taking the limelight his direction. He certainly has prospered from the fact that his opponents are playing absolute gack.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.36pm BST </strong>Of course, we only have their word that they are good friends. For all we know Poulter could drag Rose back to the locker rooms afterwards to administer a series of Chinese burns.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.39pm BST</strong> Whatever the truth, they have just lost the last hole - their first setback of the day - and whatever the result, Ian Poulter will surely brook no more criticism of his selection after a commanding performance today. </p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (11)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (10)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 2UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (9)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (7)</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.41pm BST </strong><strong>The last half hour or so have definitely belonged to the boys in baby blue.</strong> Stenson and Wilcon reach the turn two down after looking like lost children for much of the front nine. McDowell and Jimenez have constantly flirted with skipping back to all square but Harrington and Karlsson look much more comfortable now.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>3.46pm BST </strong>Jimenez putts from off the green to win the hole but can't quite make it. They halve the 11th. </p> <p>Up ahead, Poulter hits an extremely difficulty chip shot blind to abut eight feet past the pin. Chance of a par.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3.38pm BST </strong>It's Cink now on the 12th green, with the chance of hauling Rose and Poulter back further. It's up and left and he can't make it. Rose still has a lot to do to halve the hole and give Laurence Slater one in the eye. He misses and now Cink and Campbell are back to three down. Time for Rose and Poulter to settle and close this one out.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3.53pm BST </strong>A ping in the inbox and it's Chris Colman. \"I don't watch a lot of golf but why doesn't anyone create a putter with a spirit level incorporated into the base?\"</p> <p>Get on to Dyson. He's your man.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>3.54pm BST </strong><strong>Wilson and Stenson continue the charge.</strong> Presumably Phil Mickelson is not enjoying the feeling of being the wrong side of a comeback. Kim left him short on the green, and Lefty isn't smiling any more. </p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 3UP</strong> (12)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (11)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 1UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (10)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (7)</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>3.57pm BST </strong>Poulter now from the rough behind the 13th where he's surrounded by bunkers and looking down on the green. He finds the long stuff out behind the left of the pin, but it's not too bad for Rose and given his nasty lie Poulter will be reasonably happy.</p> <p>McDowell and Jimenez will not be though; they're back to all square. The Spaniard could only skid it back into through from a deep, deep bunker lie and McDowell can do better. They concede the hole and their lead.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>4.02pm BST</strong> If indeed Poulter and Rose do collapse - and a missed putt from Poulter at the 13th <strong>means they are now just two up </strong> it would be the first time a five-hole lead has been squandered in the Ryder Cup. Ever. Or so I am reliably informed by our broadcasters, but surely not? <br> <br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 2UP</strong> (13)<br>Leonard/Mahan A/S Jimenez/McDowell (12)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 1UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (11)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (9)</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>4.05pm BST </strong>It really is crunch play for Faldo's front-runners now. They are two up with five to play and the momentum is firmly with Cink and Campbell. </p> <p>Remember as well, that this same American pair turned a three-hole deficit into a one-hole in in yesterday's fourballs, where they were matched against...Poulter and Rose</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>4.10pm BST</strong> Mickelson and Kim have bogeyed <em>again</em> and that match is now all square.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>4.17pm BST</strong><br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 3UP</strong> (13)<br>Leonard/Mahan v<strong> Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (12)<br>Mickelson/Kim A/S Stenson/Wilson (11)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (9)</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>4.17pm BST</strong> Justin Leonard is taking putting tips from <strong>George Hiram Walker Bush</strong>, who is to the PGA circuit what Jack Nicholson is to the NBA. No sign of <strong>Slick Willy Clinton</strong> as yet.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>4.21pm BST </strong>Unbelievably, Stenson and Wilson can now take the lead.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>4.23pm BST </strong>Wilson strokes it a little light and it takes an agonising twist just before the hole. That really is a shame; but to be fair the European pair are only in this position because Mickelson and Kim have been putting on their best Laurel and Hardy impression. All they are missing is a rake and a precariously positioned pot of white paint. </p> <p>If Wilson and Stenson want this they need to up their game in response to the Americans' collapse.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.25pm BST </strong>Poulter is back in the zone now after his screaming fit on the 14th. He hits a fine drive and a win here would make the overall score 5 1/2 to 3 1/2 and give the Europeans guys behind them a real fillip.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 3UP</strong> (14)<br>Leonard/Mahan v<strong> Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (13)<br>Mickelson/Kim A/S Stenson/Wilson (13)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (11)</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>4.30pm BST</strong><strong> Poulter and Rose win 4&amp;3 over Cink and Campbell</strong></p> <p>Cink hit the water once more while Poulter opted for dry land, specifically the green. Some shuffling from the Americans followed by a concession. <br><strong><br>First point of the day goes to Europe.</strong></p> <p>United States 5 1/2 - 3 1/2 Europe</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4.34pm BST </strong>\"The experience of yesterday helped us dig in there and that's what saw us through,\" says Rose. Poulter insists he wasn't surprised to see Garcia and Westwood left off, becaue Europe \"have such a strong team\". He must have been a <em>little bit</em> taken aback, though.</p> <p>Word from the curse is that <strong>Garcia was feeling a little bit poorly today.</strong></p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.40pm BST </strong>While all that was going on, Miguel Angel Jimenez has been a busy man. He sprayed it off the 14th, missed the subsequent putt, gone back to all square and then set McDowell up beautifully on the 15th for a chance to regain the initiative. However Leonard was up to the match and holed a long putt to put the pressure back onto McDowell, who duly putted. Still all square.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4&amp;3</strong> (F)<br>Leonard/Mahan A/S Jimenez/McDowell (14)<br>Mickelson/Kim A/S Stenson/Wilson (13)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (11)</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.42pm BST</strong> McDowell now, to the 15th green. And it's not great to be honest. Jimenez gave him a good lie on his preferred left to right draw, and although he had two bunkers between himself and the pin, he has left his partner with a big ask. It is on the green though. </p> <p>Lefty, Lefty, Lefty. What are you doing? He's hacked his drive on the 14th way, while Henrik Stenson has taken the more orthodox route of absolutely <em>cracking</em> it down the fairway. Wilson steps it up and puts it within 12ft of the pin. This is a big chance for the European pair.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.51pm BST</strong>I'm rather miffed at the lack of emails; even Naylor has turned off his PC it seems. Which, given the standard of his last few efforts, is probably for the best. Don't try and tell me you have better things to do on a Saturday afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>3.52pm</strong> Mickelson's fourth is on the green and very makeable, but their opponents have only taken two and the hole is duly conceded. <strong>Stenson and Wilson lead for the first time. </strong></p> <p>Meanhwile, Harrington and Karlsson are matching Furyk and Perry hole for hole. They missed a good chance to get it back to one hole between them on the 12th and were then forced on the back foot on the 13th, but Harrington held his nerve and holed out.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.57pm BST </strong>And Harrington follows that magnificent putt with a drive more fitting of the Open champion.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4&amp;3</strong> (F)<br>Leonard/Mahan A/S Jimenez/McDowell (14)<br>Mickelson/Kim v <strong>Stenson/Wilson 1UP</strong> (13)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (11)</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>5.00pm BST</strong><strong> We're expecting the announcement of the fourballs pairings very soon.</strong></p> <p>You can follow the USA's demoralising defeat in the afternoon session <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf7\">here</a> with Scott Murray and Rolf Golf.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>5.04pm BST </strong>My inbox is all a-flurry.
