  "<p>When Montana's governor, Brian Schweitzer, launched his campaign for re-election this summer he chose to be pictured on a horse lassooing a calf, and in silhouette against a barn door, presumably after a long hard day on the ranch. What was not mentioned was the word Democrat - a party affiliation that in some parts of the west still conjures up associations with gay marriage, gun control and abortion.</p> <p>Those sensibilities could be in for a shake-up as Barack Obama launches the Democrats' most aggressive drive for years for votes from the Rocky Mountain west.</p> <p>The strategy unrolling now across the west could turn once reliably Republican states such as Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and possibly even Montana into America's new electoral battleground. But it is Colorado which is viewed as the biggest prize.</p> <p>\"Colorado defines competitive,\" said Dick Wadhams, the chairman of the state Republican party. \"I think either party could carry Colorado.\"</p> <p>It all hinges on how you define Democrat - a political label that has been comprehensively altered by a new generation of elected politicians in the west - and an impressive grassroots organisation now being assembled by the Obama campaign.</p> <p>The big push begins next week, when some 50,000 Democrats are expected to converge on Denver for the party's convention. Democrats see the convention, especially the spectacle surrounding Obama's nomination speech at a giant football stadium, as a chance to impress on voters in Colorado and other states the party's renewed commitment to the west.</p> <p>Obama's first appearances on his return from holiday this week were in Nevada and New Mexico, and he is planning to campaign in Colorado after the convention. \"Colorado and the west are both a big focus of this campaign,\" said Stephanie Mueller, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign in Denver.</p> <p>Not that John McCain, the Republican candidate, is expected to yield easily. McCain has lived in Arizona for the last 25 years, and has made frequent visits to Colorado and Nevada.</p> <p>But after eight years of an unpopular George Bush, Democrats believe that voters in Colorado and other states are disillusioned with Republicans. They are frustrated with the rising deficit, the war in Iraq, and worried about the economy. This could be Obama's moment.</p> <p>Unlike previous elections, when the Republicans rode a wave of emotion over terrorism, or issues such as gay marriage and abortion, this time voters' concerns are down to earth: the economy and the need for renewable energy sources.</p> <p>That has led to a blurring of the conventional political divisions. In Colorado, unaffiliated voters outnumber Democrats and Republicans. Soaring petrol prices have turned conservative farmers into ardent conservationists. Even the Republican candidates have taken to carrying around solar film panels and using public transport to get to campaign events.</p> <p>The early signs are encouraging for Obama. The two candidates are virtually tied in Colorado, although a Rasmussen poll last week put McCain ahead of Obama in the state for the first time in seven months. McCain and Obama are also running neck and neck in Nevada and New Mexico.</p> <p>But Obama claims the edge in organising, grafting his campaign on top of rejuvenated local organisations.</p> <p>In every state of the west, the Obama campaign has taken the lead in voter registration, increasing the number of Democrats.</p> <p>In New Mexico, the campaign has opened 20 offices - compared to just five in the 2004 elections - and the organising effort has extended into rural areas that have not been involved in presidential contests for decades.</p> <p>In Colorado, Obama's campaign has opened 10 offices, including in towns seen as redoubts of the Christian right.</p> <p>Even in Montana, a state of 950,000, the campaign has deployed 40 paid organisers to register new voters.</p> <p>Wadhams insists that much of the excitement about Obama's organising prowess is over-stated. \"There is a lot of smoke and mirrors,\" he said.</p> <p>But Democrats across the west believe enthusiasm about Obama's candidacy and the campaign's investment in the region could make this the Democrats' moment.</p> <p>\"That investment and the energy that we see on the ground in New Mexico will absolutely translate in November,\" said Brian Col\u00f3n, the chairman of the New Mexico Democratic party.</p> <p>The challenge for Obama though will be to resist Republican efforts to brand him as an elitist, or a textbook liberal more at home in San Francisco or New York than in the west.</p> <p>For the last 40 years, the west has sent only Republicans to the White House - except for 1992 when Bill Clinton benefited from a third party candidate who drained Republican support. By 2000, Republicans governed all eight states, and controlled 13 of the 16 Senate seats.</p> <p>Then Democratic activists began to plot their comeback. In Colorado, local entrepreneurs began funnelling money towards liberal causes, building up institutions that could put Democrats on a surer footing. First came the thinktanks, then media monitoring organisations. By 2004, the local renewal efforts under way in Colorado and other states had a powerful patron in Howard Dean, the Democratic national committee chairman.</p> <p>Under Dean, the Democrats began putting money and resources into building up party networks even in states which had little prospect of voting a Democrat into the White House. Western Democrats credit the strategy with gaining a foothold for the party even in staunchly Republican states such as Utah and Wyoming, and say it will prove its value over the coming years.</p> <p>\"In a place like Montana there simply weren't the resources to keep a party headquarters opened during the entire year in non-election years and so it was very difficult,\" said Schweitzer. \"It kept people on the ground recruiting new candidates, maintaining voter files, making sure we have county committees that are working and organised.\"</p> <p>At the same time, the Democrats began recruiting a new generation of organisations, and began scouting for political candidates who could appeal to moderate voters in the west.</p> <p>Eight years on, five of the eight governors of western states are now Democrats, and five of the 16 senators.</p> <p>Betsy Markey, who is hoping to unseat a Christian right member of Congress in Colorado, has a simple formula for success that Obama might want to heed. What makes a successful Democrat in the west? \"The government not telling you how to live your life and what to do,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The mock soldier's grave in the front yard, along with the bottles of urine in the refrigerator and the anti-war posters festooning the first floor, tell visitors this is not just another group house for politically minded Washington DC twentysomethings. </p> <p>The bottles, says Adam Kokesh, a tattooed, muscular former US marine sergeant and prominent member of a community of virulently anti-war Iraq veterans based in the house, are to be tested for depleted uranium, a munitions component thought to be harmful to soldiers exposed to it. </p> <p>The house, in a rundown neighbourhood of the US capital, is headquarters for Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW), a group with more than 1,200 members across the country and on military duty in Iraq. It is also a flophouse for visiting and needy veterans, a \"frat-house on steroids\" in the words of one resident, and a friendly space where veterans can commune with like-minded comrades.</p> <p>On a recent Sunday evening, I joined Kokesh, several other Iraq veterans, and a crew of other anti-war activists for a cook-out at the vets' house. They talked politics, shared war stories, drank beer and wine. Then, and over several other meetings, the members told me about the domestic situations peculiar to the group: the bottles of urine stored in the refrigerator, a member's inordinate rage at malfunctioning computer equipment, and a shared sense of purpose and experience that mitigates and outweighs the strife.</p> <p>The members of the IVAW house are the newest incarnation of a long tradition of anti-war activism by US military veterans. They are the tattooed, web-savvy descendents of the Spanish-American war veterans who decried US torture of Filipino rebels at the turn of the 20th century, and the shaggy-haired Vietnam vets who tossed away their medals in protest. They offer legitimacy to the anti-war movement, showing that peace activists aren't necessarily anti-military or motivated by knee-jerk opposition to George Bush. Some were against the war from the start, but had already joined up and hoped they could speed US involvement in Iraq to an end. Others were afraid to resist deployment or were unaware how to do so. </p> <p>\"The vet groups are our street cred,\" a California-based anti-war activist tells me at the group's barbecue. Medea Benjamin, co-founder of feminist anti-war group Code Pink, says the veterans' group appeals to the American glorification of the military, even within the anti-war movement. \"People who have been part of a war that I consider immoral and illegal still have more legitimacy than people who were against the war from the very beginning and refused to fight in it,\" she explains, sitting in the vets' living room while her college-age cohorts chat with the veterans and eat hamburgers and sausages. \"They command more of a sense of authority and more of a sense of understanding of what's actually happening on the ground. Generals who come out against the war are seen as more important even than Congress members who are against the war.\"</p> <p>The house has become a centre of Washington anti-war activism, but it serves a different function for the five men who live there. \"When you're coming out of the military, the one thing that you lose bigger than anything else is the camaraderie of your unit,\" says 27-year-old Geoff Millard in between bites of sausage and sips of root beer. \"You've got family, you've got friends, but you don't have the people who have been there, and that's a huge thing. In this community we have that, whether they want to live here, or they want to stay a weekend, or they just want to come over and watch some TV for a little while. It's just a space for veterans.\" </p> <p>A native of Buffalo, New York, Millard joined the National Guard when he was 17. After the 9/11 attacks, he was sent to New York City to search incoming vehicles for bombs. When the Bush administration began pushing for war with Iraq, Millard didn't want to go.</p> <p>\"Our military is trained to kill people and we're the bullies,\" he says. \"I didn't sign up in the military to be a bully. I signed up to protect people from bullies. We started to talk about Iraq, and Iraq just didn't pass the smell test.\" In winter 2003, he marched with a group of Vietnam vets in a massive New York anti-war protest. He thought briefly about fleeing to Canada, but was afraid to desert. \"I thought that if I resisted they would put me in jail,\" he says. \"So I went to Iraq\". He spent a year as an administrative aide to a general there in 2004.</p> <p>Now a web journalist, Millard joined IVAW in December 2005, and co-founded the Washington chapter the following autumn. He and Kokesh had lived together in a small apartment, but wanted space for other like-minded veterans. The men moved into the Washington house in December. </p> <p>The 50-member IVAW chapter, of which Millard is president, sub-lets the lower level, which was converted into comfortable office space decorated with anti-war posters. Considering it is occupied by a group of twentysomething bachelors, the house is remarkably tidy. The men share cleaning duties, dividing up chores on Sundays so the house will be clean for vets attending the weekly support group and visitors to their potluck dinner. \"Most of us were NCOs in the military, so we're good at telling people to clean up shit,\" Kokesh explains. </p> <p>Some of the men have jobs or are attending university, while others spend their days writing anti-war literature, working out, or travelling across the region to speak to anti-war groups, recruit other veterans and help organise new chapters. The attic and basement hold \"berths\" for dozens of visitors, and 43 guests bunked in the house during a March anti-war event.</p> <p>The members don't merely provide food, drink and company. At the weekly \"home-front battle buddies\" support group in the basement of the house, the veterans talk over their war experiences, hash out problems adjusting to civilian life and struggles with the US veterans administration, and even discuss relationship troubles. The men, a rotating group of about five who live in the house, plus regular visitors from outside Washington, can also spend hours a day strategising and talking politics. Their tactics include \"counter-recruitment\" of young people sought by the military and sit-in style protests at government buildings.</p> <p>Life in a house full of jittery veterans can be trying, they acknowledge. Routine domestic disagreements explode into rage. Many of them have trouble sleeping, and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \"The PTSD is so thick in the air you can cut it with a knife,\" one tells me. They say they have all learned to recognise when one of their housemates is in the grip of an episode (symptoms differ in each, they say, with some becoming depressed and angry, others anxious, others restless).</p> <p>Millard recalls that an uncooperative internet modem sent him into a fury, and when he tried to discuss the issue with his housemates, he could only yell and curse. He eventually threw the equipment across the room. \"I had been seeing a girl for about two weeks at the time, and she was here, and that ended that relationship,\" he tells me, sitting in his book-lined den upstairs. But his housemates were more accommodating: \"They let me flare up like that and they gave me that space, and then as I naturally came down of that, I was able to say 'I'm sorry, I was not thinking naturally.'\"</p> <p>Kokesh, a Santa Fe, New Mexico native, is working toward a master's degree in political management at George Washington University, and supports himself with modest speaking fees from addressing student and anti-war groups. He also spends more than an hour a day working out in a garage where he keeps weights and a computer. With his muscles, tattoos, shaved head, goatee and piercing eyes, Kokesh is an intimidating presence. A fluent, self-taught Arabic speaker, he served in a civil affairs unit in Iraq and was decorated for providing humanitarian aid to civilians during firefights.</p> <p>While some vets prepare the food at a cookout, Kokesh works with other veterans and supporters in the basement on a speech he is planning to give at an upcoming rally. Though anti-war, Kokesh isn't a liberal. He describes himself as a libertarian, and supported Ron Paul in his bid for the US presidency.</p> <p>The workshop devolves briefly into an impromptu political strategy session, as Kokesh compares the efficacy of what he calls \"direct action\" with \"civil resistance\", techniques such as blocking a major city intersections to call attention to their anti-war message. \"If I have a conversation with a kid in high school and he decides he's not going to join the military, that's a direct action,\" he says. \"A war resister inside the military is both. But that doesn't necessarily make it more effective. I would rather have 1,000 high-school students who would otherwise not join, than one person within the military resist. That's taking 1,000 bodies out of the system as opposed to taking one out.\"</p> <p>Other participants in the discussion note the news value of a high-profile soldier refusing to redeploy to Iraq. The IVAW members who live in the house and visit it appreciate sharing space with people who have seen, first hand, the results of the US adventure in Iraq and who know how to manage war-traumatised veterans.</p> <p>\"I've to a certain extent found solace in it,\" says Nick Morgan, a bearded 24-year-old who was a combat engineer in Iraq. \"I'm kind of an anxious person, I'm kind of antsy. I have a lot of quirks that make people uncomfortable. But being around cats like this, it's second nature. Nobody really notices it.\"</p> <p>But it is their shared devotion to ending the war in Iraq and agitating for veterans' benefits and reparations for Iraqis that ultimately holds the house together, even when tensions are running high. \"There's a certain environment that we're able to create here that is distinctly for veterans who have the freedom of mind to see that they've been lied to, that essentially a certain element of their service was for nothing,\" Kokesh tells me emphatically. \"An environment that empowers them to live out their convictions\".</p>",
  "<p>The scale of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/20/water.food\">British water consumption</a> and its impact around the world is revealed in a new report today, which warns of the hidden levels needed to produce food and clothing.</p> <p>The UK has become the sixth largest net importer of water in the world, the environment group WWF will tell a meeting of international experts in Stockholm, with every consumer indirectly responsible for the use of thousands of litres a day. Only 38% of the UK's total water use comes from its own resources; the rest depends on the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2008/aug/19/water\"> water systems of other countries</a>, some of which are already facing serious shortages. </p> <p>The study makes the first attempt to measure the UK's total \"water footprint\" and highlights the extent to which our imports come from countries which are running out of fresh water. It calculates that: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Average household water use for washing and drinking in the UK is about 150 litres a person daily, but we consume about 30 times as much in \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2008/aug/19/water.food?picture=336718185\">virtual water</a>\", used in the production of imported food and textiles;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Taking virtual water into account, each of us soaks up 4,645 litres a day;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Only Brazil, Mexico, Japan, China and Italy come higher in the league of net importers of virtual agricultural water. People in poorer countries typically subsist on 1,000 litres of virtual water a day; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Different diets have different water footprints. A meat and dairy-based diet consumes about 5,000 litres of virtual water a day while a vegetarian diet uses about 2,000 litres.</p> <p>\"What's particularly worrying is that huge amounts of the food and cotton we consume are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future,\" said Stuart Orr, WWF's water footprint expert. </p> <p>With modern patterns of consumption, businesses and consumers are inadvertently contributing to the slow death of some of the world's most important rivers, the charity warns, and we may not be able to depend on the same supplies in the near future. </p> <p>Experts at this week's World Water Week forum in the Swedish capital are increasingly talking of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/water\">fresh water as \"the new oil\"</a>, a finite resource that is running out in some areas and will become more and more expensive with a knock-on impact on consumer prices.</p> <p>British retailers are already examining how much of their food comes from areas where water reserves are depleted and whether they will need to relocate some of their production as water runs out.</p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer is working with WWF to calculate the water footprint of its entire food and clothing ranges. M&amp;S's technical director, David Gregory, said the availability of water over the next decade was already a key part of the company's strategic decisions about where to source food for its stores. </p> <p>\"We are already in discussion with WWF about our decisions about where to grow crops in the future,\" he said.</p> <p>The retailer is auditing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/water.food\">water footprint</a> of five key crops - strawberries, tomatoes, lettuce, potatoes and roses - to establish where and how they should be grown in the next few years to make best use of water resources. The WWF report identifies Spain, northern African countries including Egypt and Morocco, South Africa, Israel, Pakistan and Uzbekistan as countries which face acute water stress and yet supply the UK with substantial exports of their water. </p> <p>Sainsbury's agronomist, Debbie Winstanley, confirmed that water would be \"on every agenda in sourcing food\". </p> <p>\"From our point of view we've got to look at where our growers are going to get their water from,\" she said. Most British supermarkets currently depend on southern Spain for salad crops, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and peppers, as well as broccoli out of season through the winter months. </p> <p>But over-extraction of water for horticulture and the tourist industry have led to a crisis there. Aquifers have become severely depleted and the water table has been infiltrated by the sea. \"There are massive challenges with water in places like Murcia [southern Spain]. We have to look at least 10 years ahead in terms of security of supply. Murcia will have to look very different in five years' time. </p> <p>\"We'll have to look at new desalination technologies, and we may have to look at crops that can cope with more saline conditions, such as broccoli. We take tomatoes out of Morocco in winter, and we've looked very hard at Moroccan water, but it's complex; if you use more greenhouse production here it uses more energy. Peas and beans are a steady all-year market. We've got to think about how we get them here in a responsible manner,\" she said.</p>",
  "<h2>Toby's takeover</h2> <p>The collective ire of the nation's gardeners has been raised by Toby Buckland, Monty Don's replacement on Gardeners' World. No sooner had his appointment been announced than cries of \"Sexism!\" were bouncing off the walls of the BBC blog, because the job didn't go instead to Carol Klein, the caretaker presenter since Don's sudden illness earlier this year. Klein is an excellent gardener and a terrific presenter and if she wanted the job it is a bit of a raw deal. We'll just have to put up with the sight of handsome, smiley Buckland coming over a bit Mellors-ish in the long border as best we can. </p> <h2>Driven by misery</h2> <p>Roy Den Hollander is a man with a mission. The lawyer spends much of his time representing clients in \"anti-feminist\" (his words) cases, trying to sue nightclubs for holding ladies nights and, now, Columbia University for offering courses in women's studies. But there is pain beneath the snarling surface. Turns out Den Hollander married a Russian woman in 2001 who, once they got to the US, wasn't so much interested in his generous nature and his balding, middle-aged appearance as his green card, and promptly divorced him. He admits he's still \"bitter\". Poor man. He just needs a hug!</p> <h2>The name event</h2> <p>Kris Myddleton (n\u00e9 Dyer) is a screenwriter who chose to change his surname when he got married last year. Yup, you read that right: he took her name. It only required \u00a334 at the deed poll office (no automatic wedding licence option for men), months of administrative hell, widespread confusion and universal ribbing from his mates. Why put himself through it all? For the glorious cause of gender equality? Well, no. Apparently it was because his bachelor name \"was rubbish\".</p>",
  "<p>Nato is useless. It has failed to bring stability to Afghanistan, as it failed to bring it to Serbia. It just breaks crockery. Nato has proved a rotten fighting force, which in Kabul is on the brink of being sidelined by exasperated Americans. Nor is it any better at diplomacy: witness its hamfisted handling of east Europe. As the custodian of the west's postwar resistance to the Soviet Union's nuclear threat it served a purpose. Now it has become a diplomats' Olympics, irrelevant but with bursts of extravagant self-importance.</p> <p>Yesterday's Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels was a fig leaf over the latest fiasco, the failure to counter the predictable Russian intervention in Georgia. Ostensibly to save Russian nationals in South Ossetia, the intervention was, in truth, to tell Georgia and Ukraine that they must not play games with the west along Russia's frontier. Nato, which Russia would (and should) have joined after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is now a running provocation along the eastern rim of Europe.</p> <p>There was no strategic need for Nato to proselytise for members, and consequent security guarantees, among the Baltic republics and border states to the south. Nor is there any strategic need for the US to place missile sites in Poland or the Czech Republic. This was mere Nato self-aggrandisement reinforcing the lobbying of the Pentagon hawks.</p> <p>These moves were bound to infuriate the hypersensitive Russians, and did. There is no point in western pundits saying that the thrust of Nato close to the Russian border is quite different from the cold war location of Soviet missiles in Cuba. It seems the same to Russian nationalists.</p> <p>Nor is it any good pundits remarking that Russia's defence of Russian minorities in Georgia is quite different from Nato's intervention to defend the Kurdish minority in Iraq or the Albanian minority in Serbia. Again, that is just how it seems to Russia.</p> <p>George Bush said earlier this month that \"the age of spheres of influence is over\". In that case why push that most potent sphere of influence, Nato, to the Russian border? And what of the sphere-of-influence theory that underpinned Bush's neoconservative plan to conquer the Muslim world for democracy?</p> <p>The US's two greatest bugbears at present, Russia and Iran, both have grounds for feeling encircled by hostile forces. However badly they behave, they too are vulnerable to the politics of irrational fear. Both countries display the rudiments of democratic activity, with paranoia playing on pluralism.</p> <p>The glib response of Nato's leaders has been hawkish, that the only thing \"these people\" understand is tough talk and big sticks. But that just apes Russia's attitude towards Georgia and Ukraine, which at least Russia has the power to enforce.</p> <p>The west is not threatened by Russia. Turning its border into a zone of bluff and counter-bluff, so Nato can boast 10 extra flags outside its headquarters, has proved destabilising and provocative. Intelligence, like morality, is supposedly the tribute power should pay to reason. Russia is boorish and belligerent enough already. Why encourage it?</p> <p>With Russia, Nato is playing with fire. In Afghanistan/Pakistan - which should always be yoked together - it is playing with dynamite. Here Osama bin Laden and Donald Rumsfeld must be laughing in unison: the former because Nato's conduct of the war against the Taliban has been a recruiting sergeant for al-Qaida in Pakistan; the latter because everything he said about nation-building has proved true. \"Get in fast and get out fast\" was his strategy, and he was right.</p> <p>The fall of Pervez Musharraf might be good news for Pakistan's democrats. It is dreadful news for Nato's proconsuls in their fortified enclaves in Kabul. The likelihood of political turbulence in Pakistan can only increase the hold that pro-Taliban tribes have over the long frontier with Afghanistan and, with it, the certainty of an escalating war.</p> <p>Nato's performance here has been dreadful. A half-hearted peacekeeper, it had displayed divided counsels, divided leadership and divided rules of engagement. It has reflected the view of the US general in Kosovo, Wesley Clark, that US units should never again be placed under international command. International command means no command at all.</p> <p>A Pentagon report by General Barry McCaffrey, revealed last week, criticises the lack of command unity in Kabul. \"Afghanistan is in misery,\" it says. \"A sensible coordination of all political and military elements of the Afghan theatre of operation does not exist.\"</p> <p>There is said to be a plan for a 12,000-strong reinforcement of US troops to stage a Baghdad-style \"surge\", outside the remit of Nato. The idea that the rural Taliban might be susceptible to the same handling as Iraq's urban militias may be senseless, but is on the cards. Such a surge would mean three rival armies - Afghan, Nato and American - roaming this troubled land, a gift to any enemy.</p> <p>The newly triumphant coalition in Islamabad must long for the days when its Afghan backyard was quiet. The Taliban regime was funded by opium and the Saudis, and of no strategic (as opposed to terrorist) concern to the west. There were no US Predators bombing villages, no CIA phone-tapping, no suborned Pakistan intelligence officers, no outside interference. Pakistan's sphere of influence might not be to every taste, but it was roughly stable.</p> <p>We shall now have the world's sixth largest country, and with an active nuclear arsenal, in internal turmoil because of a doomed Nato adventure on its border. Taliban units are operating freely throughout the south and east of Afghanistan and within miles of the capital, Kabul, flatly contradicting the mendacious spin of Nato spokesmen over the past two years.</p> <p>Western governments seem never to learn. Counter-insurgency wars of this sort never work if they become drawn out. At best they leave broken, corrupted, failed states such as Lebanon and Kosovo - and, soon, Iraq. At worst they mean defeat. If ever America were walking into another Vietnam, it is now in Afghanistan, fast replacing Iraq as the mecca for every anti-western fanatic on earth.</p> <p>Peace in Afghanistan might not matter over much. But its absence will grossly destabilise Pakistan, and that matters greatly. Is this to be another feather in Nato's cap?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The disgraced glam rock star Gary Glitter last night appeared to have dodged deportation to the UK after refusing to get on a connecting flight from Bangkok and asking Thai officials to allow him to enter Thailand. After a series of confrontations involving flustered British embassy officials, police and Thai immigration officers, Glitter whose real name is Paul Gadd, collapsed in an airport hotel room complaining of a heart ailment. </p> <p>Glitter had earlier been released from a Vietnamese prison where he had served two-and-a-half years for sexually abusing children, and was expected to arrive at Heathrow shortly after 7am today, having been released from Thu Duc prison, north of Ho Chi Minh City. He was jailed in November 2005 after being convicted of repeated sexual assaults on two girls, aged 10 and 11.</p> <p>His return was thrown into confusion last night, however, when he reportedly collapsed in room 6000 of the Louis Tavern, a hotel sited at the airport but which is in a \"no man's land\" between disembarkation and immigration, so not officially in Thailand.</p> <p>In the early hours of this morning he was attended to by a doctor on call at the airport and paid for his treatment in cash. He has demanded to be taken to hospital today. If he is allowed he will have to pass Thai immigration. </p> <p>Sudarat Sereewat, secretary of Thailand's Fight Against Child Exploitation group, who was present said: \"At first he asked to be allowed to enter Thailand. But he was refused. He said he had not committed any offence here, but he was told he was not wanted here.\"</p> <p>Unable to enter Thailand Glitter then demanded to fly on to Singapore but was advised that there was no flight until much later in the morning. He then demanded that he be treated as a first class passenger. \"I am not getting back on the plane with all the press there,\" he said. \"And I'm not going to the first class lounge to be hassled by them. And I'm not going to London. You can't make me. I have done my time, I am a free man.\"</p> <p>After complaining of fatigue and dizziness he was escorted by two Thai immigration policemen to Louis Tavern, a VIP area with small bedrooms in which transit passengers can lie down. Rooms are usually rented by the hour with three hours costing the equivalent of \u00a350. Glitter rented a room for eight hours for \u00a3100. </p> <p>A British police officer from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre who had been sent to escort Gadd back to the UK was asked to persuade him to get on the flight, but was unsuccessful. He told Thai officials that Gadd should return to London. </p> <p>Two Thai Immigration police who were sent to collect him to put him back on the flight to London refused to use force to take him back on the flight.</p> <p>And when the British police officer was asked if he had any paperwork, he admitted he had none except an order to bring Gadd home. He also admitted he had not legal jurisdiction, and he returned to the departure gate to wait. </p> <p>As Glitter was due to fly home the Home Office announced a series of measures that would make it easier to monitor sex offenders and prevent them committing further crimes in Britain or overseas.</p> <p>They include removing the need for recent evidence when police are seeking to bar offenders from areas frequented by children, for instance, requiring registered offenders to notify police earlier if they want to travel abroad, and allowing the authorities to remove an offender's passport if he has been banned from travel. </p> <p>Foreign travel orders, which prevent abusers travelling to specific countries or leaving the UK altogether, will be extended from their current limit of six months. </p> <p>\"I want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible,\" the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said. \"I've spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas.\"</p> <p>Glitter, who also served a short sentence in the UK in 1999 for possession of more than 4,000 images of child pornography, had been expected to be met on arrival by Metropolitan police officers, and will be required to sign the sex offenders' register and remain under supervision for the rest of his life. </p> <p>Under Mappa, the multi-agency public protection arrangements by which sex offenders are monitored, it is understood he will be considered a level 1 risk, requiring the lowest level of monitoring by police and probation officers.</p> <p>This means he must register an address with police and notify them if he moves or stays away for more than a few days. Reports that the former star would go to a hostel in the West Country were unconfirmed.</p> <p>He retains his British passport, however, and, visas permitting, will be free to travel overseas unless a specific order bans him from doing so.</p>",
  "<p>Ten French soldiers have been killed and 21 wounded after a Taliban ambush 40 miles east of the Afghan capital, Kabul. According to Afghan officials, four of the soldiers were executed after being captured or \"kidnapped\" during a two-day running battle with more than 100 insurgents. </p> <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy was due to arrive in Afghanistan this morning to show troops that \"France was by their sides\". The casualties were mostly from France's 8th parachute regiment, recently arrived as part of a controversial reinforcement of the French presence in Afghanistan ordered by Sarkozy earlier this year. </p> <p>Elsewhere, a team of suicide bombers attempted to storm American and Afghan national army (ANA) bases near the eastern city of Khost, the second major assault on the positions in 24 hours. </p> <p>In the past three days, more than 100 people have died during fighting and bombings around the country. \"We had an OK winter and a good spring but we are having a tough summer,\" said one official from the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The French casualties appear to have come after a joint Isaf and Afghan army patrol was ambushed on Monday afternoon in the Spir Kundi district of Kabul province, 20 miles north-east of the town of Sorobi, a strategic bottleneck on the crucial road linking the capital to the city of Jalalabad, near the Pakistani border. </p> <p>Fighting continued overnight and into yesterday morning, though local officials said that the clash was over by early afternoon. Abdul Wahed, a provincial councillor from Sorobi, said the fighting yesterday had lasted three or four hours.</p> <p>The French force was backed up by air strikes and Afghan army troops. Afghan officials said that three Afghan soldiers had been injured and dozens of Taliban militants killed. \"Recently Isaf and ANA [forces were] deployed into the area and started going on patrol. This was their third patrol and it came under attack yesterday afternoon and it lasted several hours. There were [coalition] air bombardments but it is an uninhabited area so we have no reports of civilian casualties,\" Qazi Suleiman, the Spir Kundi chief, said. </p> <p>The deaths will cause uproar in France. Sarkozy has taken French foreign policy in a more pro-Washington direction than his predecessor Jacques Chirac and has stressed France's commitment to the military and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. European nations have been under increasing pressure from the US to contribute more combat troops to contain the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Since 2002, the French have contributed 1,000 men to the Isaf force patrolling Kabul but the new troops were the first to be committed to combat operations, other than small detachments of special forces. </p> <p>The deployment was originally planned for south Afghanistan where fighting has been fiercest. Before this latest incident, 14 French soldiers had been killed since their initial deployment. Overall, 176 foreign soldiers have been killed this year. </p> <p>Accounts of the Khost incident differ. However, Arsala Jamal, the governor of Khost province, said 10 suicide bombers had been killed along with an Afghan army soldier. Jamal described a complex and ambitious operation involving two waves of attacks late on Monday night and again yesterday morning with teams of bombers backed by conventional fighters. </p> <p>\"Militarily this was very stupid,\" he said. \"The Taliban wanted to show off to the world with a spectacular strike.\" </p> <p>Kabul has seen a huge security operation in recent days aimed at preventing an attack on yesterday's Afghanistan independence day. But the problem merely seems to have been displaced. The plateaux and valleys to the north and east of Kabul have become increasingly problematic in recent months with growing numbers of attacks on convoys on the road to Jalalabad. In one incident last week near Sorobi, insurgents stopped traffic on the road and torched coalition fuel tankers. </p> <p>The lightly armed Taliban have often suffered heavy casualties whenever they have risked a formal engagement with western troops. But a Taliban spokesman yesterday claimed that the insurgents had inflicted \"heavy losses\" on such troops. </p> <p>\"This morning we ambushed Nato troops in Sorobi district using mines and rockets. We destroyed five vehicles,\" Zabihullah Mujahed told the AFP agency. </p> <p>Taliban spokesmen routinely exaggerate numbers or fabricate claims of civilian casualties. But the loss of the French troops will hand a major propaganda victory to the insurgents as will the proximity of their attack to the capital. The engagement is the first major clash to take place within Kabul province. Last week an attack on aid workers in Logar province and strikes on convoys in Wardak province, south of the capital, revealed the growing presence the Taliban has been able to establish in areas previously considered under Afghan government control.</p> <h2>'We are resolved to fight terror'</h2> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday insisted France remained committed to its military presence in Afghanistan as opposition figures condemned a deployment which saw the French army suffering its heaviest losses in 25 years.</p> <p>Paying tribute to the 10 men who died in yesterday's ambush, President Sarkozy said that, while France had been \"hit hard\" by the attack, his determination for French troops to remain part of the Nato force in Afghanistan was \"intact\". </p> <p>\"France is resolved to fight terror for democracy and for freedom,\" he said, announcing his intention to fly to Kabul last night. \"The cause is just and it is the honour of France and of her military to defend it.\"</p> <p>But the deaths - the biggest loss of life suffered by the French army since a bombing in Lebanon in 1983 - were used as an example by the opposition Socialist party to highlight the need for a national debate. \"What are the aims of this war? How many troops must there be to reach its stated objectives?\" said a statement from the party leader, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. </p> <p>The French government faced its first vote of no-confidence earlier this year when Sarkozy's move to send hundreds of extra troops to Afghanistan was greeted with dismay by the opposition and members of his own right-wing UMP. </p> <p>Opinion polls have consistently shown that the majority of the population opposes military engagement in the country and yesterday political websites were flooded with angry comments from Sarkozy's critics. </p> <p>\"There are families suffering who must be cursing Sarko for having sent young guys out there to act the big guy in front of his friend Bush,\" read one comment on Le Monde's political blog. \"Without Sarkozy's political choice these men would still be with us,\" said another on Le Figaro's website.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's former president, General Pervez Musharraf, deserves our sympathy. Not because he is being dragged out of his office whining and whingeing but because, like most dictators of his longevity, he has been caught out without a retirement plan. Only a few weeks ago he was wagging his finger at Pakistan's governing coalition and telling them to \"Put your house in order or else.\" Now he finds himself without a house to live in, and without a country willing to welcome him as an eminent exile.</p> <p>His mansion in Islamabad is still under construction and all the world leaders who flaunted him as their star bounty hunter for al-Qaida have not extended even an informal invitation. </p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, whose main job seemed to be fielding midnight phone calls from Musharraf, was asked if America would give him asylum. She said that the issue wasn't even on the table. An American pundit on the BBC World Service explained the difficulties: since he is such a high-value target for terrorists, his security will cost a lot.</p> <p>Poor Musharraf not only needs a retirement fund but also a bit of career counselling. If you look at his CV you'll only find \"self-appointed\" written before most of his job titles. At the height of his career he had his own book, Line Of Fire (which George Bush plugged for him during a state visit to the US) and his own show on Pakistan's state TV called From President's House. All the while he was supposed to be managing America's frontline in the war on terror. People who saw sinister motives in his double-dealings overrated him; he was only distracted. On the world stage he pedalled oxymorons such as \"enlightened moderation\". But there has always been a TV presenter trapped in his general's uniform. He always confused dignity with designer suits, sincerity with sour-faced self-righteousness, and good governance with good intentions, which usually surfaced after his daily Blue Label whisky sessions.</p> <p>What a shame that America's spurned lover won't get to try his luck on America's Got Talent to win his old ally back. With no western country interested in making use of his abilities, his showbiz career will have to bloom in the deserts of Saudi Arabia, that retirement home for Muslim dictators. Give him his own daytime show. His audience there will appreciate his enlightened moderation more than Pakistanis ever did.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Mohammed Hanif's play The Dictator's Wife is on now at Surgeon's Hall at Edinburgh's Fringe Festival</p>",
  "<p>Financial shares sent the market tumbling yesterday, but traders still found time amid the gloom to indulge in a little takeover speculation.</p> <p>Medical equipment group <strong>Smith &amp; Nephew</strong> jumped 13.5p to 632p on talk that US rival Zimmer could be interested in bidding. Dealers said the recent strength of the dollar - despite the US currency dipping yesterday on profit-taking - could make such a deal more attractive to the Americans, while S&amp;N's own business is going great guns according to its recent results, and so it would prove a plausible target.</p> <p>Meanwhile speculators were also pushing up shares in <strong>Scottish &amp; Southern Energy</strong>. They climbed 14p to \u00a314.53 on renewed suggestions that Sweden's Vattenfall, the state-owned utility group, could be preparing a \u00a317.75 bid.</p> <p>The overriding mood was downbeat, however, after a speech by the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Kenneth Rogoff, in which he predicted a major US financial institution would go to the wall. With continuing fears that US mortgage providers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae would need to take up a proposed government bailout, investors decided to steer well clear of the banking sector. News that analysts at JP Morgan had predicted rival Lehman Brothers could take another $4bn of mortgage-related write-offs in the third quarter did not help matters.</p> <p>So <strong>HBOS </strong>fell 22p to 277.5p - not helped by a downgrade from WestLB - <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> lost 87p to \u00a313.26, <strong>Barclays</strong> dropped 18.5p to 324.25p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> was 13.5p lower at 215p. <strong>Bradford &amp; Bingley </strong>dropped 2.25p to 51.75p, well below the 55p level of its recent cash call, which was shunned by holders of around 70% of the shares.</p> <p>On top of that came some poor US economic numbers - to whit a larger-than-expected rise in producer prices figures and an 11% fall in housing starts in July - which sent Wall Street down around 150 points by the time London closed. All this left the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> 129.8 points lower at 5320.4, its biggest one-day fall for more than five weeks.</p> <p>The US home figures and news that DIY business Home Depot had repeated its forecast of a 24% profit fall this year left building materials group <strong>Wolseley</strong> - which does much of its business in America - 36.75p lower at 389.5p. Wolseley and B&amp;Q owner <strong>Kingfisher</strong> - down 8.1p at 120.1p - have both been tipped in the past as possible targets for Home Depot.</p> <p>But mining group<strong> Xstrata </strong>added 52p to \u00a328.75p after a positive note from UBS. The bank said: \"Our number one pick [in the mining sector] is Xstrata - it trades on attractive 2009 estimated valuations, has good exposure to coal and copper prices and is likely to continue to play an ongoing part in sector mergers and acquisition.\"</p> <p>Xstrata is bidding $10bn for platinum producer Lonmin and if this does not succeed some analysts believe the company could look elsewhere. Broker Hanson Westhouse said: \"There are several other platinum companies, including <strong>Aquarius Platinum</strong>, who are ripe for Xstrata's picking should the Lonmin bid fail.\" Aquarius slipped 11.75p to 449p yesterday.</p> <p>Despite a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico missing any oil and gas installations, the crude price added about $3 a barrel on the day's dollar weakness and comments from Venezuela that Opec could cut crude production if oil continued to fall.</p> <p>Oil services companies benefited, with <strong>Wood Group</strong> up 4.5p to 405.75p and <strong>Petrofac</strong> 4.5p better at 549.5p. Pipemaker <strong>Wellstream</strong> climbed 70p to \u00a311.10 after it announced a \u00a3600m contract with Brazil's state-owned Petrobras.</p> <p>Satellite communications group <strong>Inmarsat</strong>, facing a possible bid from US hedge fund Harbinger, added 10.25p to 498.25p after the successful launch of the third Inmarsat-4 satellite.</p> <p>Back among the fallers, pubs group <strong>Punch Taverns</strong> lost 26p to 266.75p as JP Morgan moved its recommendation from overweight to neutral. The same bank pushed bookmaker <strong>Ladbrokes</strong> 16.25p lower to 221p by cutting its rating from neutral to underweight. Housebuilders are still undermined by worries about the state of the market, with <strong>Barratt Developments</strong> down 11.25p to 118p and <strong>Persimmon</strong> 27p lower at 305p.</p> <p>Retailer <strong>Debenhams</strong> dipped 4.5p to 46.5p as US investment firm Brandes trimmed its stake from 6% to 4.79%.</p> <p>There were contrasting fortunes for two Aim-listed gold miners. <strong>Minmet</strong> jumped 33% to 5.5p after the company said it was in takeover talks. But <strong>Aurum Mining</strong> slumped 44% to 52.5p when its shares returned from suspension after the resolution of a legal dispute surrounding its Andash mine in Kyrgyzstan. The problems have delayed production from the mine. The company said in a statement: \"The events of the past six months have highlighted the risks of being a single-project company in Kyrgyzstan. The board is looking at a number of new initiatives as to how these risks can be best mitigated.\"</p> <h2>Social climbing</h2> <p>Social housing and domiciliary care group <strong>Mears</strong> fell 24p to 296p yesterday on profit taking after in-line half year profits of <strong>\u00a37.6m</strong>, up around \u00a31m. Analysts expect around \u00a320m for the full year on revenues of \u00a3400m, and with an order book of \u00a31.7bn and a pipeline of potential bids worth \u00a32.5bn, Mears could conceivably make <strong>\u00a325m</strong> on revenues of nearly \u00a3500m next year. The company has just moved up from <strong>Aim</strong> to the full list, and in early September its shares will join the all-share index, which should prompt interest from tracker funds.

  "<p>Time was when the portly young actor <strong>James Corden</strong> - best known for playing Smithy in Gavin and Stacey - couldn't get an acting role. It was eight years before his first part came along - \"it taught me about rejection from a really early stage\" - but he is in such demand now that he has been approached to perform the taxing extracurricular assignment of writing the jokes for Wall's ice-cream lolly sticks. The excruciating little puns are being reintroduced after 20 years and the role of writing the first three has been offered to Corden because of his scriptwriting talents. Alas for Wall's, news of the partnership leaked out too early. As Corden hadn't signed on the dotted line, he has now increased his fee to a \"pretty obscene amount\" according to Wall's, which may put the whole deal in jeopardy.</p> <p>When the first world war prime minister <strong>David Lloyd George </strong>finally accepted an earldom and went to the House of Lords shortly before he died in 1945, cynics supposed that the old boy - who had ridiculed the upper chamber - had been talked into it by his ambitious wife and former mistress, <strong>Frances Stevenson</strong>. Not so, according to historian <strong>Dr J Graham Jones</strong>, who has published what he says was the real reason in the Welsh History Review after burrowing in archives at the National Library of Wales - it was because he feared losing his Commons constituency of Caernarfon Boroughs, which he had held for 55 years. His private secretary,<strong> AJ Silvester,</strong> took private soundings from Tories and Labour about allowing Lloyd George to stand unopposed but was rebuffed. In the event he died before he could be introduced in the Lords, three months before the general election, when the seat was indeed won by the Tories. His widow admitted, however, that her heart \"beat a little more quickly\" when he accepted the earldom.</p> <p>Religious tolerance - an occasional series: an Islamic party in Malaysia is calling for a concert to be given by the Canadian singer <strong>Avril Lavigne</strong> in Kuala Lumpur next week to be banned. \"It is considered too sexy for us.

Lavigne would not be the first to fall foul of the country's moral watchdogs: <strong>Christina Aguilera</strong> missed Malaysia out during a far east tour last year, though she did perform in Singapore, and Beyonc\u00e9 moved a planned concert to Indonesia instead, while <strong>Gwen Stefani</strong> made what she described as a major sacrifice by covering up when she sang locally.</p> <p>It is an ill wind that blows lawyers no profit: the legal bills have just come in for <strong>Britney Spears'</strong> protracted and highly publicised custody dispute with her former husband <strong>Kevin Federline</strong> this spring.

  "<p>When David Cameron sent every Tory MP off for the summer with a reading list, it was easy to spy members of the government-in-waiting on holiday in newly fashionable Padstow. Floppy-haired heads bend over Robert Kagan's The Return of History and the End of Dreams, or Cold Cream: My Early Life and Other Mistakes, by Ferdinand Mount. Toiling through the 25-volume list, with only a biography of Boris Johnson for light relief, the Tories are enduring a hard summer's slog. But those of us who have accepted with resignation the imminent end of the New Labour project have our own catch-up reading to do. I have boned up on who our new political masters are to be by carefully scrutinising the pages of the new right - a user's manual. </p> <p>On first sight, it looks like chick lit. It's called Shire Hell and it's a paperback with a pretty cartoony village on the front (with wind farm) and the inside cover is adorned with praise from such political grandees as Jilly Cooper, India Knight, Sophie Kinsella and the review pages of Tatler and Easy Living. But don't be fooled. Its author, Rachel Johnson, is Boris Johnson's freelance journalist sister and what she has written is no less than a pin-perfect portrait of the 2008 zeitgeist: a satire of the new green Tories, the old shires and the new money. If you want to know what we are in for, then this is the book of the year. Wrap the dust-jacket of Philip Bobbitt's Terror and Consent: The Wars for the Twenty-First Century around it if you're too embarrassed to be seen reading it but you will not find anywhere else a more accurate and detailed study of the coming Cameronian right.</p> <p>Johnson's previous book, Notting Hell, anatomised the Notting Hill set and was judged to be a thinly disguised portrait of her neighbours: its political classes (David and Samantha Cameron, George Osborne and Michael Gove); the media power couple (Emma Freud and Richard Curtis); the minimalist architect (John Pawson); the supermodel (Elle Macpherson); the American tycoon (Peter Soros). The residents bicker over the communal gardens and compare shades of cream from the Farrow &amp; Ball paint chart. Their dinner guests are chefs Rowley Leigh and Sally Clarke. They went to Eton (known as School) with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. They dress their children in miniature Prince of Wales checked knickerbockers, designed by a Frenchwoman in South Kensington. They knock out six children as evidence not of poor understanding of contraception but as the ultimate status symbol to show they have \"more money and more help to buy sleep, the most precious beauty product of all\". To be poor in Notting Hell is to be forced to wear a Whistles skirt and LK Bennett shoes. </p> <p>Anyone passing through Notting Hill in the first years of this century would have been floored by the enormous wealth on display. From a run-down neighbourhood in the 50s in which recent arrivals from the Caribbean rented squalid rooms from slum landlord Peter Rachman, Notting Hill imperceptibly turned into a neighbourhood in which only the gadzillionaire could afford to buy one of its ice-cream-coloured mansions. Notting Hill was where \"a cosy kitchen supper\" really meant \"a catered \u00a3200-a-head dinner\". The Notting Hill Yummy Mummy lived, according to Johnson, \"an organic life of holistic therapies and private training sessions in a multimillion-pound house . .. with just a couple of small Filipinas chained up in the basement ... [It was] about having slate solar panels to heat your London home ... as well as an eight-bedroom spread in Shropshire ... about having your hair shirt never too far from your Helmut Lang in your walk-in cupboard.\"</p> <p>By the end of Notting Hell, adulterous freelance journalist Mimi and her old Etonian husband Ralph (which if you do not know is pronounced \"Rafe\" just shows what riff-rafe you are) have fled to Dorset, selling up the inherited Notting Hill pile to take their place in the new shires - the outposts of civilisation, where \"there are no normal shops - ie ones selling Swarovski-crystal-encrusted designer jeans, organic hemp baby-clothes, Elle Macpherson Intimates - within a hundred-mile radius\". And it is so cold indoors once you move a couple feet from the Aga that the required garment is one of those quilted waistcoats in army green with brass poppers, which is apparently called a Husky.</p> <p>Dorset is inhabited by the old gentry, new City money, the Grundy under-class and the eco-warriors who live in yurts. It is a world in which you are a social nobody if you don't hold your own literary festival in the grounds of your stately home, or operate an organic farm shop making heritage cheeses. You cannot write this book if you are not part of it. Johnson's husband, Ivo Dawnay, is an old Etonian (surely a coincidence) but is it satire or affectionate portrait of the Tory world? Cleverly, she manages to just get away with a light satirical edge. She was sent into social purdah when Notting Hell came out, and all her neighbours recognised themselves, so Shire Hell is set in the invented town of Godminster. Its characters include Virginie Lacoste, \"stone-cold French superfox and children's culotte magnate\"; Granville and Catherine Cobb, owners of the Court Place farm shop and additional properties in Gstaad, Tuscany and California; Ned Bryanstone, local landowner living on capital with an expensive second wife who runs her own literary festival. </p> <p>In mid-August, Johnson, like all Tories, is not-in-town. She is in Exmoor, in her second home. I asked if the book was meant to be a satire on the Cameron set. \"I didn't have David Cameron in my head, but I was pitilessly photographing for the page what is my milieu's experience of country living, from having the Aga to owning the right boot rack. I wanted to show exactly how things look. The Conservatives are very materialistic and they dress this up with their greenness but it's just a new form of consumerism. All these things are status symbols, like Liz Hurley's Gloucester Old Spot pigs. The countryside has given people a larger canvas to display their wonderfulness.\" </p> <p>The intersection of the worlds of Notting Hill and the countryside are brilliantly illustrated by an incident that took place at last year's gala dinner hosted by Alexandra Shulman, editor of Vogue, to launch the Golden Age of Couture show at the V&amp;A. On being introduced to Kate Moss, Cameron commiserated with her for the summer flooding that had washed out her Cotswold village, which is in his constituency, and spoke knowledgeably of when the local pub might reopen. Impressed, Moss asked for his phone number. Returning to his table, Cameron proudly announced that he was expecting a call from Moss; unfortunately it was because she thought he was a plumber. </p> <p>In the coming Tory administration, the countryside will move to the centre of modish life and will bring to bear a new influence on the political agenda. \"The Tories have made the countryside very chic,\" Johnson says. \"It's a show-off thing. It allows them to say, 'We come from the soil.' And of course the shires are all Tory. Labour has done brilliantly in bringing out sleepy rural communities to a greater level of activism.\" The coming of the shires as a powerhouse of influence derives, she says, from Labour's apparent hatred of the countryside - if the Iraq war is the left's cause, the hunting ban is the right's bete noire. But the countryside had been neglected before Labour. \"Thatcher had no feel for the countryside,\" Johnson points out. The absence of rural buses long predates the 1997 Labour landslide.</p> <p>The Cameronians understand the countryside not just because they are pro-hunting and shooting and patronising the serfs, but because the Tories have, Johnson claims, benefited from the creation of enormous City wealth under Labour. The past decade has seen the self-invention of a new class she calls the agrivistes (and she includes in Shire Hell an important new coinage, the Jewray Henrys, which she says was first used by the new owner of a country estate, fitted with kosher kitchen). \"Money came into the City and rolled out west,\" she says. It was a tide which raced through west London into the counties, through the Cotswolds and on to Cornwall. Johnson herself being, if not old money, at least old class, accuses Gordon Brown of failing to tax the super-rich (is she perhaps closet old Labour?), while placing intolerable pressures on rural communities. While the decayed aristocracy has been secretly relieved to offload its large and unheatable houses, balls and chains around the necks of generations of eldest sons, it also resents the buyers who swoop in from London to view properties from the controls of a helicopter then install electronic gates, which protect the estates from the prying eyes of their former owners.</p> <p>But with the recession, the flood of wealth into the countryside has come to an abrupt halt. Reading Shire Hell three weeks ago, I felt that it was a moment in the zeitgeist so forensically captured that it was already passing away into history as you turned the pages. Johnson agrees. \"I'm the death knell to every trend. With this massive recession looming, Shire Hell may already be an anachronism. Notting Hill ended with a great jolt, with people losing their jobs in the City. It's not cool to flash it about so much now. I've heard people saying they won't take their chef in the yacht this summer and that they will have to cut back from four to two polo ponies. Thrift is the new chic.\"</p> <p>This is where Cameron comes in. Johnson claims not to be part of his set, but with her brother running London one could hardly expect their worlds not to collide. She's stayed at the country house he rents for his holidays. If you want to understand the coming Tory chic it's \"a very simple but comfortable house, there are gillies and people stalking\". I assume she does not mean crazed monomaniacs in bedrooms plastered with photographs of Jill Dando, but chaps in tweed caps toting Purdeys. Or is that wrong? Obviously, being Labour, I've no idea. The shires, Johnson says, \"are dear to [Cameron]. He brilliantly combines the new green and the old Tories.\" Will he repeal the hunting ban? \"In my view he should,\" she says, \"but I don't think he will because it would lose them votes in the cities and that's going to be a critical thing for him.\"</p> <p>So what can we expect from the new shire-friendly administration when Gordon Brown is finally dragged by his bloody fingernails into a general election? Sex, obviously. \"The whole thing of sex in the city is a great myth,\" Johnson points out. Londoners are too stressed out to bonk. In Shire Hell, as in Jilly Cooper's novels before it, rural life is a complicated web of marital infidelities and children of doubtful parentage. There's something about being close to the land that revs up the hormones. Sex is more natural and less is made of it. Johnson describes hunts in which two horses somehow become detached from the main pack, head out into the gorse and return with their dishevelled riders picking twigs out of their hair. To live in the countryside is to shag, ride, drink, or all three. Johnson says, and I find myself for the first time in our conversation a little sceptical, that she derives her observer's eye from the fact that she does none of them, and is a \"disenfranchised outsider\". In her author photo she looks like what Frasier Crane would pantingly describe as a \"dirty girl\". In saying she does not \"do sex\" you want to remind her of the extremely raunchy sex column she writes for Easy Living.</p> <p>Knowing precisely how to dress for the country is what divides the Tories from Labour. The Dorset dress code divides between Ralph Lauren patchwork cowgirl skirt and the entire stock of the Boden catalogue. The Camerons, on their Cornwall beach holiday, appeared to be dressed from head to toe in Boden, while poor Gordon Brown sat hunched in the sand grimacing for the camera in his work jacket with Sarah Brown still in her shift dress and stilettos. Johnny Boden (Eton and Oxford) and his wife Sophie are close friends of Rachel Johnson and trailing them was part of the research for the book. He gets cross when she mentions other brands.</p> <p>If the agrivistes brought Stella McCartney and Marc Jacobs to Dorset, then the sexed-up country-dwellers manage to attract each other clothed in \"tapestry-patterned embroidered cardigans\" and \"rugby shirts tucked into fractionally too-tight high-waisted jeans\". The social uncertainty of the agrivistes is measured by the studied look of their country clothes, the hilarious cravat that makes them look like \"total country plonkers\".</p> <p>In Notting Hell, freelance journalist Mimi, who will later move to Dorset, is a Guardian-reading Labour voter. Is this a device to enable Johnson to deploy her satire from behind safe cover? Or is Boris Johnson's sister secretly pinker than a huntsman's coat? At any rate, Labour voters have a spy in the enemy's camp. When the Tories win the election, they are going to have to find a way of muzzling her. Westminster Hell must be the next volume in the series.</p>",
  "<p>Fulfilling a football fixture ought to be the last thing on the minds of the people in Georgia at the moment, but try telling the players who will take on Wales in Swansea tonight that an international friendly is meaningless. Not all the Georgia national team managed to make the trip but those who escaped their war-torn country and \"risked their lives\" negotiating a 20-hour coach journey to Azerbaijan to collect visas firmly believe that a message has been sent to Russia.</p> <p>\"This is a special game for the country,\" said Petar Segrt, Georgia's technical director. \"No one from Russia believed it was possible to bring 18 players out with us from a war-torn country. The president asked me to come out with these players. He told me that the result wasn't important. This game is simply to show Russia that you can bomb us and you can send tanks into our country, but you will never stop our people. This is a symbol that they will not defeat us.\"</p> <p>Segrt repeated those sentiments time and again as he reflected on the players' determination to travel to Wales, despite the military conflict between Russia and Georgia at home. The relations between the countries mean that only two of the seven Georgia internationals based in Russia have joined up with their team-mates for the fixture at the Liberty Stadium, but Segrt saluted the efforts of those who have travelled from some of Georgia's most affected towns and cities.</p> <p>\"There was a war going on in some of the places they travelled from,\" he said. \"These players deserve big respect. They've risked their lives to get here. We spent 20 hours on a coach from Tbilisi, travelling to Azerbaijan to catch a flight. The risk was high for everyone. The biggest problem was on the border because Azerbaijan would not let us in. I cannot talk about the reasons for that. But compliments to the Azerbaijan Football Federation. They helped us.\"</p> <p>As have Wales, with Georgia's opponents tonight doing everything from providing training kit to arranging for numbers to be stitched on to the back of their shirts and organising transport to pick up the players who flew in to all corners of the British Isles from other European nations. Zurab Khizanishvili, the Blackburn Rovers defender, had a much more straightforward journey but that does not mean he has escaped the pain that people are experiencing at home. </p> <p>\"It's hard for us to play and think about football with what is happening in Georgia,\" explained Khizanishvili, who has found out that a few close friends have been caught up in the conflict. \"My family are OK but some young boys, who are my friends, are still in hospital. They are in the army and were fighting against Russia. Two of my best friends, who have been in the army for three years, tried to protect Georgia but there were too many Russians.\" </p> <p>More harrowing tales have emerged from his team-mates. \"They've seen the stuff what happened. What they have told me the last two days was a surprise because when you watched TV they didn't show too many bad things. They said 2,000 soldiers were killed but I think it was twice as many. What has happened in Georgia...without question, they have killed too many kids under 10 years. They don't care where they put the bomb so you never know who is in the house.\"</p> <p>Segrt, who urged the Uefa president Michel Platini to \"change the visa requirements for small European countries\" competing in international football to eradicate the kind of problems Georgia encountered in trying to get to Wales, has his own painful memories. \"The 11th of August was the worst night because everyone thought the Russians were going to arrive in Tbilisi and kill everyone. I think under this situation, you can understand that football was not important.\"</p> <p>With the traumatic events of the past fortnight dominating the thoughts of the Georgian players, it was little surprise that Hector Cuper, the former Valencia and Internazionale manager who took over as the national team coach at the start of the month, called a team meeting yesterday and asked whether everyone felt in the right frame of mind to play against Wales tonight. The response was unequivocal, with Khizanishvili reiterating the motivation to \"send a message to the world\".</p> <p>Cuper, who only met the Georgia players this week, claimed that the hostilities with Russia had made him \"even more determined\" to lead the country into the 2010 World Cup finals. That promises to be an almost impossible task - Fifa confirmed yesterday that next month's qualifier with the Republic of Ireland will be moved to a neutral venue because of security concerns over Tbilisi, which was bombed by Russian forces - but no one in Georgia is ready to give in. </p> <p>\"We beat the Russian Under-21 side 2-0 in Georgia eight months ago,\" added Segrt. \"At the worst time of the war they sent us a fax saying that it was fine for us to come and play a friendly against them on September 5. I sent them one back saying that we'd be there. We are a country of 4.5 million people. Russia is a country of 120 million. We have no chance of beating them in a war. But it's eleven versus eleven out there. We have a chance to beat them on the ground.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Shah of Iran went to Italy. Benazir Bhutto went to London. Now that Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf has resigned to ride out his country's political storm, could he be headed to New Mexico?</p> <p>The famously laid-back US state, where former UN ambassador Bill Richardson serves as governor, is a most unlikely destination for the former Pakistani army chief. But Shuja Nawaz, a veteran Pakistani journalist and former International Monetary Fund official, said yesterday that Musharraf may head to the American west.</p> <p>\"This is my understanding, based on conversations with people in Pakistan, that he's likely \u2026 to leave the country, and that a possible immediate destination may be Dubai, and then eventually may be New Mexico in the United States,\" Nawaz told the PBS NewsHour programme yesterday.</p> <p>If Musharraf does settle in Richardson's state, it would signify a marked d\u00e9tente between the two men. Richardson, who was America's UN representative under Bill Clinton, called Musharraf a \"terrorist\" during a January TV appearance - before correcting his characterisation to \"tyrant\" - and called for the Pakistani's resignation in late 2007.</p> <p>A US state department spokesman told reporters today that Musharraf has so far not asked for asylum in America but added that the resigned president \"has a right to live wherever he wants\".</p>",
  "<p>John McCain appeared today on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico to call for more drilling along the US coastline, restaging a rally that was scuttled weeks ago by a hurricane \u2013 and a major oil spill.</p> <p>McCain rode a helicopter about 150 miles (241 kilometres) off the state of Louisiana's coast to visit the Genesis oil rig. </p> <p>Jointly owned by Chevron and Exxon Mobil, the rig represents an environmental risk great enough that the US coast guard has set up a \"safety zone\" around its perimeter to prevent accidents.</p> <p>\"It is time for America to get serious about energy independence, and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this,\" the Republican nominee said in his prepared remarks.</p> <p>McCain touted the potential of the Genesis rig, which was given coast guard protection in 2002 due to the \"potential for loss of life and damage to the environment\" if an accident were to occur there. </p> <p>A July oil-rig appearance was scuttled by the McCain camp after the Gulf suffered two troubling plights: Hurricane Dolly and a 420,000-gallon oil spill that raised environmental alarms.</p> <p>Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats were eager to remind voters of McCain's close ties to the oil industry, distributing foam toys to the media that portrayed Exxon as the Republican's running mate and criticising McCain's claim to support \"aggressive development\" of renewable energy sources as well as new oil drilling. </p> <p>McCain skipped a December vote on a Senate plan to increase renewable energy investment by repealing tax subsidies for oil companies, Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor noted. That proposal fell short by one vote, meaning that McCain could have ensured its passage.</p> <p>\"And now [McCain is] standing with the oil companies in opposing a bipartisan compromise in Congress that would expand offshore drilling and, at the same time, make serious investments in alternative energy to break our dependence on foreign oil,\" Vietor said in a statement.</p> <p>McCain has taken to promoting offshore drilling \u2013 which he has previously opposed \u2013 with gusto, making \"drill now\" his mantra as higher gas prices spark economic anxiety in America. </p> <p>Obama, however, has also shifted to endorse opening the coastlines to oil companies, if the move were part of a broader compromise on US energy policy.</p>",
  "<p>In May, the US embassy in Israel <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/world/middleeast/30gaza.html?partner=rssnyt\">revoked Fulbright scholarships awarded to seven Palestinian students</a> because Israel refused to allow them to travel to the embassy from Gaza to apply for a US visa. When the New York Times broke the story, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice was angry at both her own consular officials who'd cancelled the scholarships and Israeli authorities who'd treated the students as if they were, well, Gazans, and not eligible to leave their cage come hell or high water.</p> <p>To put Rice's interest in context, she is a former provost of Stanford University, and the <a href=\"http://www.iie.org/Fulbright/\">Fulbright programme</a> is near and dear to her heart. The idea that politics was interfering with the free pursuit of academic knowledge offended her. In addition, understanding the shellacking that the US image has been taking in the Arab world, Rice saw the Fulbrights as a way to project a more positive image abroad.</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7430846.stm\">exerting pressure on the Israelis</a>, four of the scholarship recipients were permitted by Israel to leave Gaza. Israel continued to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/world/middleeast/05fulbright.html\">refuse permission to the remaining three</a> on unspecified security grounds. Gulfnews speculates that the reason may be that the three are teaching assistants at a school closely associated with Hamas. Knowing the flimsy pretexts the Shin Bet uses to tar Palestinians as terror sympathisers, this speculation is entirely credible.</p> <p>Since Israel wouldn't allow the three students to leave Gaza, the US embassy sent its own officials to the students and prepared their visa applications, which were subsequently approved. </p> <p>Fida Abed, one of the three, even <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-08-05-gaza-fulbright_N.htm\">got on a plane and landed in Washington</a>, DC earlier this month on his way to the University of California at San Diego, where he would pursue a computer science degree. But as soon as he alighted, immigration officials hustled him back on a return flight when they discovered that his visa had been revoked, as had the visas of the other two students.</p> <p>Revoked? Wasn't the state department the one that was so eager to allow the Gazans to pursue their Fulbright opportunities to begin with? Well, yes. So what happened? Countries do not have to provide reasons for such decisions. The best our government could do is this, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/world/middleeast/05fulbright.html?ref=middleeast\">according to the New York Times</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The American consulate in Jerusalem sent letters to Mr Abed and the two other grantees still in Gaza saying \"information has come to light that you may be inadmissible to the United States,\" and therefore their visas were being revoked. In Washington, Gonzalo Gallegos, a state department spokesman, declined to get into specifics, but said that the visas were revoked because \"we got more information\" about the grantees. </p> <p>A senior state department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that ... the latest information about the three Palestinians was enough to give pause but that \"we really have to scrub it and are now going to take a good look to see if it holds.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, Israeli intelligence appeared to make a last ditch effort to torpedo the study opportunities for the remaining three.<br><a href=\"http://themagneszionist.blogspot.com/2008/08/two-additional-reasons-for-academic.html\">Jerry Haber</a> of the Magnes Zionist has produced some interesting speculation on possible political motives for this strange turnaround:</p> <blockquote> <p>What's a better explanation for the reversal of fortune? That Mr Abed and Mr Ma'ari are the victims of a face-saving ploy that Israel was desperate to pull off, and that America has agreed to, for the moment. You know the drill \u2013 the US decides to let some of the Fulbright students in (to make Condi happy), and decides to keep some of them out (to make Israel happy). That resolves the diplomatic mini-crisis. On the backs of the Palestinians.</p> </blockquote> <p>The latest news makes me wonder whether there may be some intricate dance happening that might allow the remaining three to regain their visas. The Associated Press reported earlier this month that they have written a personal appeal to Rice asking her to intervene on their behalf: </p> <blockquote> <p>Three Fulbright scholars from Gaza appealed to secretary of state Condoleezza Rice on Thursday to reissue their entry visas, denying they were security threats ... .</p> <p>\"We do not understand why, and we do not understand what changed,\" Zuheir Abu Shaban, a 23-year-old graduate of engineering, wrote to Rice on behalf of the group. He denied he and his colleagues were security threats .... \"We are asking your help and your intervention again,\" Abu Shaban wrote to Rice. \"We just want the chance to study.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Unless Rice gets the bureaucracy to relent, at this rate, the US will be lucky if any Gaza students have an interest in studying here. Certainly, the Israeli \"evidence\" of a security threat is designed to promote obstacles for Palestinians to study abroad. It is not in Israel's interests for Gazans to do so. God only knows what academic knowledge and expertise they might bring with them to improve the lot of their fellow Gazans when they return - what new theories they might advance, new businesses they might create, new political ideas they might implant. It's all certainly too much for Israel, which prefers an impoverished, poorly educated Gaza as one that is supposedly easier to dominate. </p> <p>The US state department appears to have played right into Israel's hand. Should it have accepted Israel's information at face value? What is the value of a declaration by the Israeli Shin Bet that a Palestinian is a security risk? Look at the unproven charges used to smear Azmi Bishara and the daft reasons used to ban Norman Finkelstein from Israel. If I were Rice, I'd be asking for more evidence than Colin Powell received from the CIA before he vouched for the fact that Iraq had WMD.</p> <p>And we should also look to the flimsy evidence the US has used to ban such troublesome figures as Tariq Ramadan and others from this country. This is the problem when a country or regime becomes a national security state, as Israel and the US under the Bush administration have. In such a situation, rumours become fact, and it takes little for a citizen to cast suspicion upon him or herself.</p> <p>These Palestinian young people are learning a lesson that the US is not to be trusted, that it is little better than Israel in fabricating reasons to suspect Palestinians. Such lessons last a lifetime, and not just in those of the specific victims, but in the lifetimes of young Palestinian children, the Fulbright applicants of the future. And we wonder why Arabs hate us.</p> <p>If Rice were smart, she'd give them one less reason to do so. She'd respond favourably to the appeal by the Gaza Fulbright students, get their visas reinstated and allow them to pursue their graduate studies in the US.</p> <p>Finally, we should note that these students are lucky, because their case was taken up by a figure as powerful as the US secretary of state. According to the Israeli non-profit <a href=\"http://www.gisha.org/\">Gisha</a>, there were 1,100 Gazans last year who wished to leave to study abroad. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1008866.html\">Less than half</a> succeeded.</p>",
  "<p>There were red faces in the Walls press office today over claims in <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/08/19/gavin-stacey-star-james-corden-writing-gags-for-lolly-sticks-115875-20703772/\">this morning's newspapers</a> that Gavin &amp; Stacey star <strong>James Corden</strong> was going to write three jokes for the ice cream brand's lolly sticks. Walls stopped printing the gags in most of its lollies in 1988 and Corden's efforts were reportedly going to mark their reintroduction. But it turns out that the Bafta-winning actor and writer had never actually agreed to pen the gags, though he had been approached. Now that news has leaked out prematurely - apparently from a lunch between Walls' PR firm Shine and a journalist from the News of the World, who then broke the story in a nib on Sunday - Corden's agent has considerably upped his fee. \"He is asking for an amount that is pretty much obscene, and now we don't know whether the deal will go ahead, though we are still really keen to work with James,\" a Shine spokesman told Monkey. In case the deal really is off, here's Monkey's favourite lolly stick joke: What sort of motorbike do clowns ride? A Yama-ha-ha-ha!</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is reportedly <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/08/18/veep_week_speculation_hits_fev.html\">finalising his choice for a running mate</a> and preparing to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/us/politics/19veep.html?ex=1376798400&amp;en=43db2b379b53a6a0&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">text the news to his supporters</a> in the next few days, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/us/politics/19veep.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1219154658-nqm8e893K5kKpw7YpkJU3w\">perhaps as early as Wednesday</a> morning. And despite a brief, not-very-serious boomlet last week, that person is not likely to be John Forbes Kerry, the junior senator from Massachusetts and the 2004 Democratic candidate for president.</p> <p>Kerry, of course, is not the only Massachusetts pretender in the vice-presidential sweepstakes. Former governor Mitt Romney, defeated by John McCain in the Republican primaries, would appear to be very much alive. Still, you can't help but get the feeling that if McCain didn't, well, you know, hate Romney's guts, he'd have already tapped the man who <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/02/romney_put_in_4.html\">spent $42m on his own campaign</a> and still has plenty where that came from.</p> <p>It's been a long dry spell for those of us who live in Massachusetts, one of the few enclaves where politics is followed as avidly as sports or <a href=\"http://www.americanidol.com/\">American Idol</a>. We haven't elected a president since John Kennedy in 1960. It's a sign of desperation that we've been reduced to getting excited about the vice-presidency, which, as one holder of that office, <a href=\"http://www.nndb.com/people/358/000054196/\">John Nance Garner</a>, memorably observed, is \"not worth a bucket of warm piss\".</p> <p>That said, there's an argument to be made that Kerry and Romney might be the best possible choices. Hear me out.</p> <p>I don't recall Kerry's name coming up at all until last Wednesday, when <a href=\"http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2008/08/13/vp-john-kerry.aspx\">David Bernstein</a> of the Boston Phoenix picked up on some cable chit-chat by Hillary Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson. Within hours, longtime Kerry tormenter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/13/stateofselfindulgence\">Jon Keller</a> of WBZ-TV (Channel 4) was <a href=\"http://cbslocalblogs.prospero.com/WBZ_Keller?entry=97\">pushing the idea</a> on his blog, and he <a href=\"http://cbslocalblogs.prospero.com/WBZ_Keller?entry=101\">followed it up</a> on Friday. That, in turn, led to a photo of Obama and Kerry on the <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com\">Drudge Report</a>, over the caption \"NO WAY?!\"</p> <p>Well, why not? At the moment, it looks like Obama may be leaning toward senator Joe Biden of Delaware, who was <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0808/Biden_calls_for_1_billion_in_emergency_aid_to_Georgia.html\">dispatched to the war-torn republic of Georgia</a> earlier this week. Biden is thought to have the edge over the likes of Indiana senator Evan Bayh and Virginia governor Tim Kaine because of his foreign-policy experience. But Kerry's is at least as impressive. And given Kerry's near-victory in his presidential run four years ago, he's someone who has already established a certain comfort level with the electorate.</p> <p>Biden has a well-known foot-in-mouth problem (remember his <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/31/biden.obama/\">observation</a> that Obama was the first black candidate who's \"clean\" and \"articulate\"?) <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/01/AR2006110102513.html\">So does Kerry</a>, to be honest, but he's more disciplined than the notoriously loose-lipped Biden. Kerry and Obama also share a mutual enemy, Jerome Corsi, who's reprised his Swift Boat lies of four years ago with a <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808150015?f=s_search\">book-length attack on Obama</a> that's currently <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/books/bestseller/besthardnonfiction.html\">number one</a> on the New York Times bestseller list.</p> <p>As we all know, Kerry is a bit of a stiff. But he's strong where Obama is weak. He's an experienced Washington hand who'd make a credible president should it come to that. Kerry would not be the most inspiring choice, but Obama could do worse - as he almost surely will if he picks Biden.</p> <p>Romney is simultaneously more likely to get the nod than Kerry and more problematic. His negatives are obvious. For one thing, he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/04/AR2008020402805.html\">gives pandering a bad name</a>, having switched from moderate to conservative positions on abortion rights, illegal immigration, campaign-finance reform, gun control and embryonic stem-cell research in order to ingratiate himself with the religious right. For another, evangelical Christians still <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/16/us/politics/16veep.html?ex=1376625600&amp;en=ceca905293606c07&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">fear his Mormonism</a>. Then, too, <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/401151/john-mccain-reminds-mitt-romney-what-a-terrible-candidate-he-was#more-401151\">McCain's dislike of Romney</a> was visceral and obvious during the primaries.</p> <p>But Romney, like Kerry, is plausible as president, which McCain needs, given his age and <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/113705\">history of cancer</a>. Romney's public persona may be hard to warm up to (he's charming in small-group encounters), but he's smart, well-spoken and, as a businessman and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/20/howmittgotmass\">governor</a>, proved himself to be competent, though ambitious to a fault. (<a href=\"http://thebostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/editorial/documents/04509217.asp\">Trashing Massachusetts on the presidential campaign trail</a> while he was still governor did not go over well here.)</p> <p>Ironically, because Romney was so unconvincing as a born-again right-winger, putting him on the ticket would help to solidify McCain's image as a different kind of Republican who can appeal to moderates and independents. McCain is, in fact, a conventional conservative, but his <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2008/2/4/the_myth_of_a_maverick_matt\">media-created image as a \"maverick\"</a> has proved endurable beyond all reason.</p> <p>I don't expect that either Kerry or Romney will wind up on a presidential ticket. And I realise that we Massachusetts political junkies have a vastly overblown sense of our importance.</p> <p>But if Biden spends a week defending himself after making some hideously inappropriate remark, or if McCain has a health scare that focuses attention on whatever unprepared cypher he finally settles on, well, remember: they could have done better. And they would have if they'd picked someone from Massachusetts.</p>",

  "<p>Three figures in white dresses comb back their long hair, revealing their faces. It is like watching curtains slowly part on lives that have been hidden away from view.</p> <p>These women were consigned to an asylum in the 1940s. Set in a hair salon within the same institution four decades on, The Idiot Colony is a record of grinding frustration and fleeting tenderness. As the women have their hair done to the crackle of a radio, their memories play out in a series of flashbacks.</p> <p>One of them was locked away for her \"dirty mind\": she had an affair with a black American GI while her husband was off fighting. The second had a baby after being raped as a girl. The third never speaks - she has a befuddled otherworldliness about her - but there is a delicate hint that she may have loved another woman.</p> <p>Directed by Andrew Dawson, this carefully choreographed production brings to life the sterile, regimented existence of the hospital, where time drips away like a leaky tap. A bored doctor asks pointless questions. A woman sits disconsolately in a tub while nurses scrub her back - a picture of lovelessness.</p> <p>But RedCape Theatre's play is not unrelentingly bleak. It is often luminous to look at, as the three women sway back and forth between the litheness of youth and the dashed hopes of old age. A particularly ravishing sequence involving a wet towel makes you think of swimming under a waterfall.</p> <p>If the show slides at times toward the mawkish, you forgive it because it also has has a sly sense of fun. There is a sexy tingle to the scenes where one of the women is again entwined with her lover in her imagination. This is one to catch before it slips away.</p>",
  "<p>Gary Glitter was today deported from Vietnam following his release from prison after serving most of a three-year sentence for child sex offences.</p> <p>The former glam rock singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was driven from Thu Duc prison to Ho Chi Minh City airport and put on a Thai airlines plane to Bangkok. </p> <p>He is expected to arrive back in Britain at 7.15am tomorrow, where he is likely to be met by police officers at Heathrow airport. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said she did not want him to be allowed to leave the country again.</p> <p>\"We need to control him, and he will be, once he returns to this country,\" Ms Smith told the radio station TalkSport today. </p> <p>\"It certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that he's got, he shouldn't be travelling anywhere in the world. I want Gary Glitter to be controlled whilst he's here and I don't want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children.\"</p> <p>He will be made to sign the register of sex offenders, requiring him to tell the police where is living and notify police if he plans to go abroad. He could also face an order prohibiting him from going near children or using the internet.</p> <p>Vietnamese authorities forced Gadd to travel economy class after blocking his preferred choice of first or business class.</p> <p>The executive class ban for Gadd, travelling on passport number 761028553, issued to him while he was in prison, came after lawyers attempted to book a ticket back to Britain on Qatar Airways, via Doha.</p> <p>Qatar Airways refused to take him. He instead took the Thai flight via Bangkok, where authorities said they would ensure he boarded the second leg of the journey.</p> <p>Sudarat Sereewat, a member of the Thai National Human Rights Committee, said she would be at the airport when it landed together with Thai immigration police.</p> <p>\"We are aware of his passport number and will happily assist Mr Gadd to the intended destination in case he has second thoughts about stopping off here,\" she said.</p> <p>Gadd, 64, was jailed in March 2006, after he was convicted of molesting two girls aged 10 and 11 in the southern coastal city of Vung Tau. His sentence was later reduced for good behaviour.</p> <p>His lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, said Gadd was looking forward to returning to Britain: \"He is OK but he is worried about his health. He has problems with his hearing and his heart.\"</p> <p>In a recent interview with the Vietnamese newspaper Cong An Nhan Dan (People's Police), Gadd said he was thinking about resuming his singing career and that he might move to Hong Kong or Singapore. However, last week he said he wanted to come back to the UK to take advantage of the health service.</p> <p>Kinh said Gadd left prison at 11.30am (5.30am BST) and that he was driven the 90 miles to the airport.</p> <p>Thu Duc is the biggest prison in Vietnam, with more than 10,000 prisoners - including about 100 foreigners. It is in Binh Thuan province, 87 miles north of Ho Chi Minh City.</p> <p>In his 1970s glam rock heyday, Gadd performed in glittery jumpsuits, silver platform shoes and bouffant wigs. He sold 18m records and recorded a string of top 10 hits.</p> <p>His most successful song, the crowd-pleasing anthem Rock and Roll (Part 2) cracked the top 10 in the US, where it continues to bring sports fans to their feet with its rousing one-word chorus: \"Hey!\"</p> <p>During the 1990s, his career faltered, although he appeared on occasional quiz shows and made variety show performances.</p> <p>His fall from grace began in 1997, when he took his laptop computer to a repair shop and an employee discovered thousands of hardcore images of children.</p> <p>Two years later, British authorities convicted him of possessing child pornography, and Gadd served half of his four-month jail term.</p> <p>He later went to Cambodia but was expelled in 2002 after children's rights advocates protested about his presence in the country.</p> <p>Gadd subsequently moved to Vietnam, where he took up residence in a seaside villa in Vung Tau, a resort town popular as a weekend getaway for residents of Ho Chi Minh City.</p> <p>Neighbours said they often heard the bald and burly Gadd singing loudly by his swimming pool and entertaining teenage girls.</p> <p>In November 2005, police launched a week-long manhunt for Gadd after allegations arose that he had been molesting girls at his villa.</p> <p>He was arrested at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where he was trying to board a flight to Bangkok. He was convicted in March last year, when the trial judge denounced him for \"disgusting and sick\" behaviour.</p> <p>The court said Gadd had molested the girls repeatedly at his villa and in nearby hotels. His sentence was reduced by three months last year for good behaviour during Vietnam's annual lunar new year prison amnesty.</p>",
  "<p>Nicolas Sarkozy today said he would travel to Afghanistan after 10 French soldiers were killed after Taliban insurgents attacked their patrol near Kabul.</p> <p>A three-hour gun battle broke out after the attack yesterday, 30 miles east of the capital, in the Surobi district, continuing sporadically overnight and picking up this morning, when the Nato soldiers were killed, Afghan military officials said today. A further 21 were injured. </p> <p>One Afghan source claimed four of the soldiers had been kidnapped by the insurgents and killed. </p> <p>French reinforcements in armoured vehicles joined the battle today, while other troops stopped civilian traffic from entering the area. Witnesses reported helicopters flying overhead. </p> <p>The deaths of the men, from the 8th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment, represent the biggest single loss of life for the French in Afghanistan since the US-led invasion of 2001 ousted the Taliban regime. Before yesterday's attack, the total French death toll was 14.</p> <p>At April's Nato summit in Bucharest, Sarkozy pledged a further 700 soldiers to Afghanistan, and their arrival by the end of this month will take the French contingent, based mainly in Kapissa province, north-east of Kabul, to 2,600. </p> <p>A Taliban spokesman said insurgents had used mines and rockets to inflict \"heavy losses\" including the destruction of five French vehicles. Retaliatory airstrikes killed five militants and 15 civilians, they claimed. </p> <p>Surobi district chief Qazi Suliman put the Taliban death toll at 13.</p> <p>The French ministry of defence in Paris would confirm only that a clash involving French troops, who are with Nato's International Security Assistance Force, was ongoing. </p> <p>The attack is the deadliest upon foreign troops since 16 American soldiers were killed in June 2005 when a rocket-propelled grenade shot down their helicopter. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the town of Khost, a squad of six suicide bombers tried to storm the main US base in south-eastern Afghanistan, three of them detonating their bomb vests, just before midnight yesterday.</p> <p>The Taliban launched several waves of attacks at the Camp Solerno base a few miles from the Pakistan border - the second largest US base in Afghanistan after the headquarters at Bagram. They were fought off and surrounded by ground forces, fighter aircraft and helicopters.</p> <p>A total of 13 insurgents, including the six bombers, died in the attack, said the Afghan ministry of defence.</p> <p>One US soldier was killed, four Afghan troops were wounded and there were a number of civilian casualties.</p>",

  "<p>Chris de Burgh may not be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/01/worldmusic.iran\">playing a gig in Iran</a>, after all. It seems, you see, that he forgot to ask Iran's permission. </p> <p>IRNA, an Iranian news agency, reported yesterday that the Music Office of Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has not issued a permit for the concert. Not because of economics, visa rules or religious issues \u2013 simply because de Burgh has yet to submit an application.</p> <p>Back in December, de Burgh announced a series of historic concerts for the summer of 2008. The singer was to play alongside Arian, an Iranian pop group, marking the first Iranian concerts by a Western star since the country's 1979 revolution. De Burgh and his Iranian partners promised performances in June or July.</p> <p>But official permission is required for any concert to take place in Iran - and authorities say that this has not been granted. </p> <p>De Burgh's camp issued some vague reassurances. \"We have been looking into a concert and been working on it for a while,\" a spokesperson told the BBC. \"Permission has not yet been granted but we have also not yet been denied.\" Or in other words: No, we haven't asked yet.</p> <p>For the moment at least, Iranians must listen to Lady in Red alone, at home, with the blinds drawn \u2013 just like the rest of us.</p>",
  "<p>Russia and Georgia today exchanged 20 prisoners of war, but there was still no sign of a Russian withdrawal from Georgia that was supposed to have begun yesterday.</p> <p>The prisoner exchange began as two Russian military helicopters landed in the village of Igoeti, the closest that Russian forces have advanced to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. Soldiers and men in unmarked clothing disembarked and two people on stretchers were taken to Georgian officials. Georgian ambulances later brought two other people to the helicopters. One was on a stretcher.</p> <p>Alexander Lomaia, the head of Georgia's security council, told reporters in Igoeti that 15 Georgians and five Russians were exchanged. </p> <p>\"It went smoothly,\" he said. The operation also witnessed by Russian Major General Vyacheslav Borisov, who commands troops in the area.</p> <p>Russia's most forward position last night was where it had been for the past few days, at Igoeti, 27 west of Tiblisi. Russian tanks were visible today in the surrounding wooded hills. An armoured vehicle also ploughed into a line of stationary Georgian police cars.</p> <p>Lomaia said the exchange removed any pretext for Russians to stay in Igoeti or anywhere on Georgia's only significant east-west highway. Russia announced yesterday it had begun to pull back forces after an EU-brokered ceasefire agreement, but as of this morning there was no sign of significant movement in Igoeti or in the nearby strategic city of Gori.</p> <p>The Russians appeared determined to interpret the ceasefire and promised withdrawal as they see fit. One Russian defence official indicated that a withdrawal from Georgia proper is not imminent.</p> <p>\"Rear units, as well as second- and third-echelon units are being pulled back first. The vanguard units will be pulled back at the final stage,\" Colonel Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's land forces, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.</p> <p>Despite claims by Moscow that a pullout had begun, Russian forces yesterday could be seen across most of the country, and Georgian officials claimed that armoured columns had tried to push further into the mountainous heartland, towards Borjomi in the south and Sachkhere in the west.</p> <p>\"We could leave here in two minutes. But we've had no orders to pull out,\" said a Russian soldier manning a checkpoint yesterday about 25 miles west of the capital, Tbilisi. He knew nothing about a ceasefire.</p> <p>Georgia's foreign minister, Eka Tkeshelashvili, said Russian troops had razed a Georgian military base at the western city of Senaki.</p> <p>\"Practically speaking there are so far no signs of withdrawal at all. What they're trying to do is to widen their territorial presence,\" Tkeshelashvili said before flying to Brussels to appeal for support from Nato foreign ministers today. \"They have pretty much unrestricted freedom of action. They are trying to show us they are masters on the ground right now.\"</p> <p>She said she would call for punitive diplomatic measures against Russia, excluding Moscow from international institutions, if Moscow refused to comply.</p> <p>A Georgian interior ministry spokesman said columns of Russian armoured vehicles were stopped by police roadblocks outside Borjomi and Sachkhere and agreed to turn back. But another column broke through a similar roadblock west of Tbilisi.</p> <p>One report circulated yesterday evening suggested the Russian forces would only begin their promised withdrawal after nightfall, and Georgian officials said they would review the situation in the morning after further international pressure.</p> <p>\"I might be naive, but I'm still hopeful that a very strong, common effort by Europe and the United States will be effective in the withdrawing of Russian troops from territory of Georgia,\" Tkeshelashvili said. \"We'll see how well grounded my expectation is.\"</p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, vowed to initiate a troop withdrawal yesterday after signing the agreement on Saturday. On Sunday he told France's president Nicholas Sarkozy a pullout was imminent.</p> <p>Last night Russian officers insisted that the withdrawal had already begun. In Moscow the deputy chief of staff, Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said: \"According to the peace plan, the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun.\" This included Gori, he added.</p> <p>Russian officials across the border in North Ossetia echoed this. \"War columns are already leaving. The main pullout will take place today. It takes a long time to pack up a tank,\" a Russian spokesman in the North Ossetia capital, Vladikavkaz, said. \"We are talking days not weeks.\"</p> <p>Another Russian military spokesman, Lieutenant General Nikolay Uvarov, told the BBC last night that Russian forces had left Gori, which lies on the main east-west highway running through the heart of the country. </p> <p>However, Russian troops were very much in evidence in the town, and at checkpoints between Tbilisi and Gori, searching cars and cutting the road between east and west Georgia. Nor was there a sign of military movement from Gori towards South Ossetia.</p> <p>Georgian officials also claimed the Russians were busy laying mines. Tkeshelashvili said that one of her principal appeals to Nato today will be for help in demining.</p> <p>\"Russian forces are not leaving. They are merely rotating their hardware. One comes, another one goes,\" said Irakly Porchkhidze, a Georgian government official inside Gori, where humanitarian relief was arriving today. He added: \"There is no pullout.\"</p> <p>There was growing concern that the Kremlin plans to exploit ambiguities in the Sarkozy-drafted agreement to justify a semi-permanent presence inside Georgia's borders. Moscow today indicated it intended to deploy its forces under an internationally brokered peace agreement in 1999, allowing Russia a generous \"security zone\". </p> <p>The zone extends nine miles around Tskhinvali and allows a \"corridor\" into Georgian areas. The document was designed to end the Georgian-Ossetian conflict and agreed by a joint control commission, an international body. The Georgian foreign minister, Tkeshelashvili, said the 1999 deal only allowed Russia a maximum of 500 peacekeepers, not to garrison towns or set up checkpoints.</p> <p>South Ossetian militias yesterday said they had no intention of handing back territory. On Saturday the militias, supported by Russian heavy armour, seized Akhalgori, 25 miles north-west of Tbilisi. \"This is now ours. It's Ossetian land,\" a militia spokesman said yesterday morning.</p> <p>The town was under the control of South Ossetia's interior ministry and police administration, he said. The Georgian flag had been replaced by a white, red and yellow Ossetian one.</p>",
  "<p>Annie Lennox has compared her foot to a dead fish, and not in a good way. The former Eurythmics singer has had an operation on her spine, and though she is now recovering in London, there's something fishy about her left limb.</p> <p>\"[It's] like a dead fish,\" she wrote on her blog, \"freezing and numb. I'm going to have to get myself a crutch and a parrot, so I can fob myself off as a pirate and scare the neighbourhood preschoolers!\"</p> <p>Lennox was in Mexico for the International Aids Conference when a back spasm forced her to leave early, flying back to Britain for surgery. It was, she wrote, \"more pain than I've ever experienced in my life\". The 53-year-old was wheeled from her airplane, prompting her to write that she \"felt a bit like Elizabeth Taylor\". </p> <p>Surgery went smoothly to release an impinged nerve, and Lennox is now recovering at home. Other than her numb left foot, her only complaint seems to be the endless Olympics coverage. \"I can't stand sport,\" <a href=\"http://www.annielennox.com/blog.php?blogStory=1232\">she wrote on her blog</a> earlier this week. \"I'm avoiding the Olympics like the plague.\"</p> <p>Lennox's medical troubles have postponed the release of The Annie Lennox Collection, a compilation originally due in November. \"Some of my plans and schemes have had to be put on hold, because there's not much I can do if I can't walk properly,\" she wrote. That album includes a new song, Pattern of My Life, written by Keane's Tom Chaplin. </p> <p>Maybe Lennox could record a fishy pirate remix.</p>",
  "<p>Ten French soldiers have been killed and 21 wounded following a Taliban ambush 40 miles east of Kabul. According to Afghan officials, four of them were executed after being captured or \"kidnapped\" during a two-day running battle with more than 100 insurgents. </p> <p>The casualties were mainly from the 8th Parachute Regiment, recently arrived in the country as part of a controversial reinforcement of the French presence in Afghanistan ordered by Nicolas Sarkozy earlier this year. The French president is due to arrive in Afghanistan tomorrow morning to show troops that \"France was by their sides\".</p> <p>Elsewhere in the country, in one of the most audacious attacks since the Taliban relaunched their insurgency two years ago, a team of suicide bombers attempted to storm American and Afghan National Army (ANA) bases near the eastern city of Khost, the second major assault on the position in less than 24 hours. </p> <p>In the past three days, more than 100 people have died in fighting and bomb attacks around the country. \"We had an okay winter and a good spring but we are having a tough summer,\" said an official from Nato's International Security Assistance Force. </p> <p>The French casualties appear to have come after a joint Isaf and ANA patrol was ambushed yesterday afternoon in the Spir Kundi district of Kabul province, 20 miles north-east of the town of Sorobi, a strategic bottleneck on the crucial road linking the capital to the city of Jalalabad near the Pakistani border. </p> <p>The deaths are likely to cause uproar in France. Sarkozy has taken French foreign policy in a radically more pro-American direction than his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, and has stressed France's commitment to the military and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. Since 2002 the French have contributed a 1,000 men to the Isaf force patrolling Kabul but the new troops were the first to be committed to combat operations. </p> <p>The French deployment was originally planned for the south of Afghanistan where fighting has been fiercest. Before this latest incident, 14 French soldiers had been killed since their initial deployment. Overall 176 foreign soldiers have died this year.</p> <p>A Taliban spokesman claimed today that the insurgents had inflicted \"heavy losses\" on Nato troops. \"This morning we ambushed Nato troops in Sorobi district using mines and rockets. We destroyed five vehicles,\" Zabihullah Mujahed told the AFP news agency. </p> <p>Taliban spokesman routinely exaggerate numbers or fabricate claims of civilian casualties, but the loss of the French troops will hand a major propaganda victory to the insurgents. The lightly armed Taliban have often suffered heavy casualties whenever they have risked a formal engagement with western troops, preferring to avoid direct confrontation. </p> <p>Fighting continued overnight and into this morning though local officials said that the clash was over by early afternoon. Afghan officials said that three ANA had been injured and dozens of Taliban militants killed. </p> <p>\"Recently Isaf and ANA deployed into area and started going on patrol. This was their third patrol and it came under attack yesterday afternoon and it lasted several hours. There were [coalition] air bombardments but it is an uninhabited area so we have no reports of civilian casualties,\" Qazi Suleiman, the district chief, told the Guardian. </p> <p>Abdul Wahed, provincial councillor from Sorobi, said the fighting today lasted three or four hours.</p> <p>The propaganda value of the battle will be enhanced by its proximity to the capital. The engagement is the first major clash to take place within Kabul province itself. Last week an attack on aid workers in Logar province and strikes on convoys in Wardak province to the south of the capital revealed the growing presence the fragmented alliance of groups that comprise the Taliban have been able to established in areas previously considered under government control. </p> <p>Kabul has seen a huge security operation in recent days aimed at preventing an attack on the Afghanistan's Independence Day on Monday. </p> <p>However the problem merely seems to have been displaced. The rugged plateaux and valleys to the north and east of Kabul has become increasingly problematic in recent months with growing numbers of attacks on convoys on the road to Jalalabad. In one incident last week near Sorobi, insurgents stopped traffic on the road and torched coalition fuel tankers. </p> <p>Accounts of the incident at the US and ANA military bases near Khost differ. However, Arsala Jamal, the governor of Khost province, said that 10 suicide bombers had been killed along with one ANA soldier. Jamal described a complex and ambitious operation involving two waves of attacks late on Monday night and again yesterday morning, with teams of suicide bombers backed by conventional fighters. \"Militarily this was very stupid,\" he said. \"The Taliban wanted to show off to the world with a spectacular strike.\" </p> <p>Isaf officials insist that the campaign against the insurgents cannot be won purely by military means. Brigadier-General Richard Blanchette, Isaf spokesperson said the French casualties \"would not deter Isaf from supporting the people of Afghanistan in their fight against the enemies of peace and stability\".</p>",
  "<p>Gary Glitter was today released from prison in Vietnam after serving most of his three-year sentence for child sex offences.</p> <p>The former glam rock singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was driven from Thu Duc prison to Ho Chi Minh City airport, from where he will be deported back to Britain. Vietnamese authorities have forced Glitter to travel economy class after blocking his preferred choice of first or business class.</p> <p>The executive class ban for Glitter, traveling on passport number 761028553 issued to him while he was in prison, came after lawyers attempted to book a ticket back to Britain on Qatar Airways, via Dohar.</p> <p>Qatar Airways refused to take him. He will instead take a Thai airlines flight via Bangkok, where authorities said they would ensure he boarded the second leg of the journey. </p> <p>Sudarat Sereewat, a member of the Thai National Human Rights Committee, said she would be at the airport when it landed together with Thai immigration police.</p> <p>\"We are aware of his passport number and will happily assist Mr Gadd to the intended destination in case he has second thoughts about stopping off here,\" she said.</p> <p>Glitter is due to leave Ho Chi Minh City at 8.50pm (2.50pm BST). He is booked on a flight to London Heathrow, arriving at 7.15am tomorrow.</p> <p>He is expected to be met at Heathrow by police and required to sign the register of sex offenders. He will then be subject to monitoring and will have to tell the police where he plans to live and if he plans to go abroad. He could also face an order prohibiting him from going near children or using the internet.</p> <p>Glitter, 64, was jailed in March 2006, after he was convicted of molesting two girls aged 10 and 11 in the southern coastal city of Vung Tau. His sentence was later reduced for good behaviour.</p> <p>His lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, said Glitter was looking forward to returning to Britain: \"He is OK but he is worried about his health. He has problems with his hearing and his heart.\"</p> <p>In a recent interview with the Vietnamese newspaper Cong An Nhan Dan (People's Police), Glitter said he was thinking about resuming his singing career and that he might move to Hong Kong or Singapore. However, last week he said he wanted to come back to the UK to take advantage of the health service.</p> <p>Kinh said Glitter left prison at 11.30am (5.30am BST) and that he was being driven the 90 miles to the airport.</p> <p>Thu Duc is the biggest prison in Vietnam, with more than 10,000 prisoners - including about 100 foreigners. It is in Binh Thuan province, 87 miles north of Ho Chi Minh City.</p> <p>In his 1970s glam rock heyday, Glitter performed in glittery jumpsuits, silver platform shoes and bouffant wigs. He sold 18m records and recorded a string of top 10 hits.</p> <p>His most successful song, the crowd-pleasing anthem Rock and Roll (Part 2) cracked the top 10 in the US, where it continues to bring sports fans to their feet with its rousing one-word chorus: \"Hey!\"</p> <p>During the 1990s, Glitter's career faltered, although he appeared on occasional quiz shows and made variety show performances.</p> <p>Glitter's fall from grace began in 1997, when he took his laptop computer to a repair shop and an employee discovered thousands of hardcore images of children.</p> <p>Two years later, British authorities convicted him of possessing child pornography, and Glitter served half of his four-month jail term.</p> <p>He later went to Cambodia but was expelled in 2002 after children's rights advocates protested about his presence in the country.</p> <p>Glitter subsequently moved to Vietnam, where he took up residence in a seaside villa in Vung Tau, a resort town popular as a weekend getaway for residents of Ho Chi Minh City.</p> <p>Neighbours said they often heard the bald and burly Glitter singing loudly by his swimming pool and entertaining teenage girls.</p> <p>In November 2005, police launched a week-long manhunt for Glitter after allegations arose that he had been molesting girls at his villa.</p> <p>He was arrested at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where he was trying to board a flight to Bangkok. He was convicted in March last year, when the trial judge denounced him for \"disgusting and sick\" behaviour.</p> <p>The court said Glitter had molested the girls repeatedly at his villa and in nearby hotels. His sentence was reduced by three months last year for good behaviour during Vietnam's annual lunar new year prison amnesty.</p>",
  "<p>A suspected suicide bomber killed 23 people in the compound of a hospital in the volatile north-west region of Pakistan, police said today.</p> <p>Another 20 people were wounded in the blast at the district hospital in Dera Ismail Khan, 175 miles south-west of Islamabad. </p> <p>The explosion happened as Shia Muslims were protesting against the killing of a leader. Gunmen shot the leader earlier, and his body had been taken to the hospital.</p> <p>North West Frontier Province police chief, Naveed Malik Khan, said Sunni Muslim militants were believed to be responsible for the blast.</p> <p>\"This area has been hit by sectarian violence for many years and this is also a sectarian-related incident,\" said Khan.</p> <p>Most of the dead were thought to be protesters, a city official said.</p> <p>The violence came a day after Pervez Musharraf resigned as Pakistan's president, injecting more uncertainty into the country's political scene. </p> <p>Pakistan's north-west has been plagued with militant violence. The country's tribal regions along the Afghan border in particular are considered havens for Taliban and al-Qaida-linked militants. </p> <p>Tackling the militants is a major test for the coalition government led by the Pakistan People's party of the assassinated former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto.</p> <p>Yesterday, there was further violence in the region when at least 20 Islamist militants were killed in a clash with Pakistani security forces in Bajaur, a known sanctuary for al-Qaida and Taliban militants on the Afghan border.</p> <p>The latest fighting in Bajaur erupted about 15 miles east of Khar, the main town in the region, yesterday evening after militants attacked several security checkposts.</p> <p>\"The exchange of fire lasted for about nine hours and we have reports that at least 20 militants were killed,\" Mohammad Jameel, a senior government official in Bajaur, told Reuters by telephone. </p> <p>Since July last year, Pakistan has suffered a wave of militant violence in which hundreds of people have been killed, including members of the security forces.</p>",
  "<p>The Israeli government's decision to halt immigration from Ethiopia prompted <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1218710383397&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">angry scenes</a> in Jerusalem on Sunday, during a protest outside the prime minister's house. Around 5,000 demonstrators voiced their condemnation of the authorities' actions, with the chairman of the Organisation of Ethiopian Immigrants in Israel describing the situation as \"a crime against Zionism, and the original Zionist idea of saving Jews from around the world\". </p> <p>Israel is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to absorbing new olim [immigrants], largely thanks to the small print in the country's immigration policy. Mirroring Hitler's assertion that anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent was to be considered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch\"><em>untermenschen</em></a>, the founding fathers of Israel declared that anyone with similar ancestry would therefore qualify for full citizenship of the newborn state. </p> <p>Over the years, millions of Jews have taken up this offer, and today around 15% of Israel's seven million population is made up of <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3485951,00.html\">first-generation olim</a>. Of that number, the vast majority come from the former Soviet Union, and the next largest group hail from Ethiopia, a country which has seen a mass migration of its native Jews to Israel dating back to the 1970s. </p> <p>The most famous airlift of Ethiopian \u00e9migr\u00e9s was in 1991, with the country on the brink of collapse as rebels closed in on the capital, Addis Ababa. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/376225.stm\">Operation Solomon</a> saw more than 14,000 Ethiopian Jews flown to safety in the space of a day and a half, heralding a new wave of Ethiopian immigration that has continued unabated to the present day. </p> <p>During one of my pre-barmitzvah trips to Israel, my family and I stumbled across an incredible scene in the streets of Jerusalem, as thousands of grateful participants in Operation Solomon flooded the city, marching jubilantly through the centre of town declaring their thanks for their salvation. The atmosphere was electric and highly-charged, their presence seemingly a sign of the lengths to which the Israeli authorities would go in order to rescue any imperilled Jew, regardless of where in the world they lived, or the colour of their skin. </p> <p>Less than two decades on, it is clear that Israel's relationship with its incoming <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/ejhist.html\">Ethiopian brethren</a> has soured somewhat. Human nature seemingly dictates that bad blood often exists between different ethnic groups, and Israel is no different. Despite being a largely homogenous country, in terms of religious background at least, the spectre of racism rears its ugly head between the various types of Jew making up the populace. </p> <p>As one Ethiopian girl commented, when I interviewed her last summer, \"There's racism everywhere [in Israel] - against Filipinos, and against Yemenis; although we seem to have replaced the Yemeni these days.\" Her words echoed those of the Ethiopian boys with whom I served in the army, many of whom complained of their lack of prospects in a country that simply \"sees us as no better than the Arabs\". </p> <p>Of course, there is no denying that absorbing the hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians who have made it to Israel's shores has sapped huge sums of money from the country's coffers, with the average cost of integrating an Ethiopian immigant estimated to be around \u00a360,000. However, cost alone cannot play a part in deciding which Jews can or can't qualify as olim, according to the principles on which the state was founded. </p> <p>Government ministers declare their intention to end Ethiopian immigration in one breath, and with the next announce plans to \"invest vast resources in increasing the scope of aliyah [immigration]\", which gives a clue as to quite the type of immigrant the authorities would rather encourage. Rich westerners are the flavour of the month, with both the government and <a href=\"http://www.nbn.org.il/index.php\">private organisations</a> throwing thousands of dollars at potential olim from the US, the UK and mainland Europe. These immigrants cost far less to the Israeli taxpayer, and are generally seen as a beneficial influence on both the country's economy and society as a whole. </p> <p>In the meantime, thousands of Ethiopians with Jewish roots still languish in refugee camps in Gondar, desperately praying that the Israeli government will relent and allow them too to come to the Jewish state. Israeli authorities have used the smokescreen of disputing the authenticity of their Jewishness as reason to abandon them, despite the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel declaring that calling a halt to their immigration is fundamentally wrong under Jewish law. </p> <p>Israel has set itself up to have, in essence, an open-door policy to world Jewry in the same way as the EU allows freedom of movement throughout its realm to all citizens of member states. By taking a stance such as Israel is maintaining now, its government is beginning to resemble a spin-off of Italy's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/2459968/Italy-declares-state-of-emergency-over-Roma-immigrants.html\">anti-Roma leaders</a> seemingly prepared to rewrite the rules on the basis of which type of immigrant is most desirable to its people. In doing so, Israel's rulers are ripping up the rule-book on which the state was founded, to the detriment of thousands of Ethiopians left out in the cold. </p>",
  "<p>Alistair Brownlee, a 20-year-old student from Leeds, today matched the world's best triathletes stroke for stroke, pedal for pedal, stride for stride - but his ballsy effort came to nothing as he finished outside the medals. </p> <p>Brownlee, the world Under-23 champion, was the youngest and least fancied of the three-strong British men's triathlon team but he repeatedly attacked on the bike and run, and led with just three kilometres left before hitting a monumental wall and finishing 12th.</p> <p>Of Britain's other athletes, Will Clarke finished 14th while the 2006 world champion Tim Don didn't finish at all. Later the British team revealed that Don was struck down by a stomach virus last Thursday and had been struggling to keep his food down.</p> <p>The race, which went down to a four-way sprint, was eventually won by Germany's Jan Frodeno in 1hr 48min 28sec. Canada's Simon Whitfield took silver and New Zealand's Bevan Docherty won bronze. Brownlee finished nearly two minutes back on 1:50:10. </p> <p>\"I tried to pick it up with three kilometres to go, but the wings came off,\" explained Brownlee. \"I just had nothing there. I came here looking for a medal. I prepared as hard as I could and gave everything today but I came 12th. Hopefully another four years maturity will help me gain an extra 12 places.\"</p> <p>Brownlee showed his intentions from the off, finishing the 1500m swim just behind the New Zealander Shane Reed, in 17:59. At this stage, however, the two other British athletes were already more than 30 seconds behind. Brownlee tried to break away during the second lap on the bike, only to be caught, and the majority of the pack were content to bide their time for the next two laps, allowing Clarke to make up the gap. Meanwhile Don, who had been quietly confident of a medal in his third Olympics, was going backwards.</p> <p>Clarke was disappointed with his 14th place finish. \"My training went really well and I'm in the best ever shape but I didn't do myself justice,\" he said. \"I was too far down on my swim, which meant I had to use up too much energy catching up on the bike. The others had their legs on their run but I didn't.\"</p> <p>Don was three minutes off the pace after the first of the six laps on the bike, and third-last in the field, and although he struggled on the gap between him and the field continued to grow. It was painful to watch, and almost a relief when he pulled up before the 10km run.</p> <p>With 12km of the 40km bike remaining, three men - Axel Zeebroek of Belgium, Francisco Serrano of Mexico, and Dirk Bockel of Luxembourg - established what became a 50-second lead over the peloton. But none of them could stay with the pace after the running section started and were quickly chased down by the pack, which was led by an increasing confident Brownlee.</p> <p>Brownlee, a sports science student at the University of Leeds, continued to attack and looked to have a great chance of a medal when he headed a four-man breakaway with three kilometres to go. But then his legs stopped working, his body starting going backwards, and his medal hopes faded.</p>",

Amazing huh?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>5.45am:</strong> Great news: the beach volleyball has gone into a deciding set. But that's going to be Gregg Roughley's problem, since he's here to take over another mighty tail-off in the minute-by-minute. Email him at <a href=\"mailto:gregg.roughley@theguardian.com\">gregg.roughley@theguardian.com</a></p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>5.43am:</strong> It's 27-27 in this beach volleyball, and I'm really hoping that this isn't recorded because I'm getting moderately diverted by it for nothing, if so. I have a limited resource of moderate diversion and I don't want to squander it.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>5.40am:</strong> Ideas for the London Olympic Stadium names are flooding in at the rate of three in the past hour. This from Andrew Jolly: \"We need something that encompasses the feeling of antipathy, followed by great hope, finishing in abject despair that being a British sports supporter is all about (Team GB!GB!GB! 2008 aside). Maybe the Paula Radcliffe Stadium? The England Euro 96 Stadium?\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>5.37am:</strong> Oh, and as a (somewhat crucial) addition to that last undate, Xue/Zhang Xi lead by one set to nil, so they need to win this one to reach the final. It's 24-24 now.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.36am:</strong> It's 21-21 in the second set of the all Chinese women's beach volleyball struggle between Tian Ji/Wang and Xue/Zhang Xi. And it the time it's taken to write that, it's 22-22 and they have to go to 24 to decide the winner. Titanic.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.30am:</strong> <strong>Predictable weather update from our man in Beijing:</strong> There's no effing wind again, which means Paul Goodison's gold medal sail has been postponed. There goes any excitement for the next three hours.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.24am: </strong>I'm thinking (hoping) Nick Evans is replying to Paul Savage's query at 5.13am, although his terse email is fair enough criticism of this report: \"More like the pigs ear,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.23am: </strong>Quick update from the various streams on my computer: </p> <p><strong>Brazil lead Japan in the first game in the quarter-finals of the women's volleyball</strong>; there's some <strong>table tennis</strong> happening, which is massively popular in China, less so in Farringdon; and two <strong>Chinese beach volleyball teams</strong> are going head to head in the second semi-final for the right to play the American duo in the final.</p> <p>And John Senior is no child development expert, but is going to stick his neck out anyhow: \"If Mrs Wool is due next month, I suspect Wool Junior will have outgrown his/her bottle by the time of the next Olympics. My advice: Invest in a big TV with multi-screen so Junior can sit on your knee watching CBeebies all day while you enjoy the sport. If Mrs. Wool grows suspicious, tell her you're using the Games to teach Junior about world geography and flags. (If Junior's a girl, of course, the Wool family could always move to China, delete the L from their surname, and try to get her a spot on the 2012 gymnastics team.)\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>5.13am:</strong> Paul Savage is in Nairobi, and I feel kind of guilty about only quoting this part of his very genial email. \"If the Chinese have the Bird's Nest \u2013 what will we have in London 2012? What main stadium architecture best captures our nation? The Meat Pie maybe?\" There's something to sink your teeth into emailers. Chortle.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>5.06am: </strong>It's been a mighty quiet morning for Team GB so far, but have no fear rampant nationalists because we're going to get another gold medal soon in the laser class sailing. Our boy Paul Goodison starts the medal race as such a hot favourite, he's practically Australian. So long as he doesn't capsize and finish last and the Swedish boat wins, there'll be another proud Team GB!GB!GB! moment in 60 minutes or so.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4.57am:</strong> So that's the triathlons done and Great Britain still searches for its first medal. Still, we're nailed on to win everything in 2012, because THAT'S THE LAW OF THE OLYMPICS, so tune in again then. Right now, here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/19/olympicsathletics.olympics20081\">a round up of what's been going on in Beijing this morning</a>; here's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/19/bolts_showboating_is_a_slap_fo.html\">Kriss Akabusi's provocative Awooga in the face of Usain Bolt</a> and here's Marina Hyde on <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/19/london_will_struggle_to_match.html\">Beijing's army of volunteers</a> helping the running of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.50am:</strong> <strong>Germany's Jan Frodeno wins gold in the men's triathlon. </strong>Simon Whitfield takes silver, Bevan Docherty, New Zealand, takes third. Alastair Brownlee finishes 12th, Will Clarke 14th.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.49am: </strong>Terrific stuff from Simon Whitfield, but NO! There's the man mountain Jan Frodeno, of Germany, who thunders past the Canadian, collapses to the carpet and takes gold.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.48am: There goes Whitfield. Gomez is done.</strong></p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>4.46am: </strong> Hold on, Simon Whitfield is coming back to interrupt the happy trio. Four of them for the medals, and apparently it's Whitfield with the best sprint of all of them.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4.45am: Triathlon</strong> Despite the lack of British interest (a phrase that still types itself), this is compelling. Bevan Docherty, Javier Gomez and Jan Frodeno have gone together, and it's all about their sprint finishes.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4.41am:</strong> That's the bell in the triathlon, with Javier Gomez leading the formidable-looking Frodeno of Germany, Docherty of New Zealand, and Whitfield, of Canada. Brownlee is back in seventh now.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>4.39am: </strong>Call off the dancing girls. Brownlee's run has now been downgraded to \"brave\", which, as we now know, means futile and not medal winning. The leading five have sprinted clear and the poor mite Brownlee is running through treacle as if in a nightmare.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4.37am:</strong> Brownlee has some water, and he's tipped it on his head. The breakaway comprises Gomes, Frodeno, Brownlee and Docherty.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4.35am:</strong> Six runners in the breakaway, with Brownlee one of them. Apparently Whitfield has the sprint, the Spaniards have each other, and Brownlee missed the water station.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4.33am: </strong> The Spaniard Rana has taken over this thing, from pre-race favourite Javier Gomes. Brownlee is third, although struggling a bit now since the Spanish have taken over.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4.32am:</strong> A huge Dane named Henning has just edged into the lead from Alaistair Brownlee, although the young Brit seems unperturbed. He's a real babyface is our Brownlee, which will delight the likes of Hazel Irvine and Sue Barker, who love that kind of thing.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4.28am:</strong> <strong>Alaistair Brownlee leads the Olympic triathlon.</strong></p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>4.25am:</strong> I can feel big Team GB!GB!GB! stirrings here. Alastair Brownlee is officially in third place in the triathlon, and they're getting very near to the impudent Bockel and Zeebroek.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4.22am:</strong> Alex in Sydney has some parenting advice: \"Having a child can help and also score you brownie points. You get to say things like, 'You go to bed love and I'll stay up and give him his late bottle when he wakes' rather than 'I'll be up in a minute dear, I want to watch men in very tight lycra'.\" Right now, the bulging lycra of Bockel and Zeebroek are still out in front with about a lap and a half of the running gone. The chase group, including GB!GB!GB!'s Alastair Brownlee, are about 20 seconds back.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4.18am: </strong> Bockel and Zeebroek were about 40 seconds ahead at the transition to the running, but they both look utterly spent. The better runners are in the chasing pack, apparently, which include Britain's Alastair Brownlee. The Brit has taken the lead of that chase, although the Mexican Serrano is still in third, some way up the road.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4.15am:</strong> <strong>Jumping and chucking news from Team GB</strong>: <strong>Jade Johnson</strong> has made it to the final of the long jump with her last leap of 6.61m. That puts her 11th in the 12-woman final. A threat, no doubt. Then <strong>Goldie Sayers</strong> propels the javelin past the qualifying mark and is into the final as well. <strong>Bockel and Zeebroek</strong> lead at the transition to the running in the triathlon.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4.05am: Triathlon: </strong>Apparently the Mexican Francisco Serrano isn't pulling his weight in the three-man breakaway, and Axel Zeebroek is turning round asking for him to take the lead so that him and the other rider -- Luxembourg's Dirk Bockel -- can get in his slipstream. It falls on deaf ears as Serrano sits in the middle of the three.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>4am: Triathlon: </strong>There's a three-man breakaway, led by Francisco Serrano of Mexico, and also includes thrash-metal's Axel Zeebroek. Brownlee is in the chasng group, about 28 seconds back. \"Perhaps you could ask readers on my behalf how their sports-watching (or Guardian-online-reading) habits changed after having a child?\" wonders Charles Wool. \"Wife expecting next month; occurred to me that Olympics may never be the same.\" Anyone?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.57am:</strong> According to the great God Wiki,\" says Alex in Sydney, \"in Krzygstan they still practice the illegal tradition of bride kidnapping.\" [Legal note: sue Wiki if this is wrong. Or Alex.] \"Perhaps if kidnapping was introduced to some of the events, the plucky Krzygs could motor up the medals table.\" Well, they do have those league tables for serial killers (in which Team GB!GB!GB!'s is a contender), so perhaps for 2012.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.54am:</strong> \"How is GB!GB!GB! actually pronounced?\" asks Peter Roy. \"Is it in a deep booming voice with a pause between each GB similar to the USA, USA, USA? Or is it more a GBGBGB, similar to the robot Twiki's ramblings from the Buck Rogers series?\" At the moment, it's pronounced very quietly indeed.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.52am:</strong> The American Matt Reed, a cycling specialist, has taken the lead in the triathlon. Brownlee is still able to see them, if he looks hard, and might reckon he can catch them in the run.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.48am: </strong>Halfway through the bike section in the triathlon, and the news is that Alastair Brownlee had a very good swim. It says a lot. The Belgian Croes is still out front.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.45am: </strong>Emily Freeman comes through her 200m heat comfortably. She finishes second, but that's good enough. Marko Albert and Peter Croes lead in the cycling section of the triathlon, as the field stretches. Brit watch has become slightly more dispiriting. Brownlee is ninth, Clarke about 20th, Tim Done=done.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.41am: Fire alarm news: It works.</strong></p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.37am: Triathlon: </strong> The Brownlee breakaway has been swallowed up by the main group. Tim Don, son of refereeing's Philip Don, is a minute behind the main pack and is \"not 100 percent\", according to his agent, who has a hotline to the Beeb's commentators. \"A fire alarm test at 3:30 a.m.?\" says John Senior. \"That should be popular with the Guardian's neighbors.\" They're used to it, John. Usually it's the big Monday night muesli roast, which can get a bit rowdy.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.34am:</strong> Alastair Brownlee started off as a runner, so there would be high hopes for Team GB! GB! GB! if he can get to the running section ahead. And just as I type that, the plucky Brit breaks away from the pack on his own on the bike and this might, <em>might</em> turn into something worth jingo-ing about.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.31am: Men's triathon: </strong>The Olympic record holder, Cuba's Osleidys Menendez, is sixth in the first pool of the javelin, and she might not qualify. Jenkins of Canada still leads the triathlon, with Brownlee, the 2006 World Junior Triathlon champion, second.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.26am:</strong> The Canadian Colin Jenkins takes the lead in the cycling leg of the triathlon, as the Guardian Towers security guard informs us that there'll be a fire alarm test in 10 minutes. \"Don't worry though,\" he adds to four ashen faces.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.22am:</strong> 40km on the bikes in the triathlon, and Alastair Brownlee and Frederic Belaubre attempt to elope. It doesn't last long, and they're hauled back in before they reach Gretna.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.21am:</strong> \"Baiting Kyrgyzstan is unfair on a nation suffering a chronic vowel shortage,\" zings Chris Wright. Meanwhile, Tim Don and Will Clarke have gone missing in the triathlon.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.19am:</strong> There are no members of Team GB in the men's 3m springboard, so it doesn't exist as far as we're concerned. Meanwhile, Shane Reed has become the first triathlete to crawl out of the water, with Alastair Brownlee, of GB, in 11th. It's a real evolutionary moment, that, when they crawl out of the water.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.15am: Men's triathlon</strong> You don't win a triathlon in the swimming section, I learnt while watching the women's race yesterday. But for what it's worth, Shane Reed of New Zealand is leading, from Frederic Belaubre of France and Igor Sysoev.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.04am: Men's triathlon</strong> Suddenly everything is a go-go. The shoal of <strong>triathletes</strong> are in the water, including all the British competitors; the men's <strong>3m springboard semi-finals</strong> have started in the diving place; and the <strong>women's javelin</strong> and <strong>long jump</strong> qualifying are underway in the Bird's Nest. One pair of (tired) eyes will do their best.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3am: Men's triathlon:</strong> Live action again, mercifully, as the men's triathlon gets started. Spain's Javier Gomez is the hot favourite; Tim Don, Alistair Brownlee and Will Clarke go for GB. It's at the Ming Tomb Reservoir, which is a spectacularly beautiful place, even on the approximate four-inch screen of this Hitachi telly.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>2.54am:</strong> Having spent the majority of his career guffawing at the slightest provocation, Kriss Akabusi had the smile wiped off his face by Usain Bolt \"showboating\" in the 100m. Why? <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/19/bolts_showboating_is_a_slap_fo.html\">Let Kriss explain in his own words.</a> Nathaniel Davis wasn't impressed: \"The fact that Bolt broke the world record while not even caring about breaking the world record is anything but showboating, it is almost too humble to fathom,\" Nathaniel says. \"For me, what made Bolt's 100m win so extraordinary and awe-inducing was not simply his speed, but his refreshingly relaxed approach to a sport that has become too technical, too inhuman. Bolt only wanted to win; I find his lack of interest in anything else inspiring.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2.50am: </strong>The<strong> women's javelin</strong> is underway in the athletics arena, the preposterously named Bird's Nest. The Czech favourite sets the early pace, with a 67.69m throw. <strong>Goldie Sayers</strong> is Great Britain's hope here, and she has her first chuck in the coming hour.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2.44am:</strong> Andrew Jolly is getting in touch with his inner Kyrgyzstan: \"In the interest of harmonious Anglo-Kyrgyzstani relations, and in the (probable) absence of any Kyrgyzstan nationals following the MBM, could I be the first to point out that they only have a population of 5 million, and so their medals/population ratio is quite similar to the invincible Team GB!GB!GB!. Team Kyrgy!Kyrgy!Kyrgy! even has a nice ring to it.\" They call that the \"population defence\" to any medals table debate, I think.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.41am: Beach volleyball: </strong>Two match points are saved, one when Misty-May Treanor flaps one into the net. But then, a hopeless serve from the Brazilian player goes straight into the net, and that's that. USA win 21-12, 21-14 to book their spot in the final.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.39am: Beach volleyball:</strong> USA, the defending Olympic champions, are 18-12 to the good, and looking like a great bet for the final. And, eat that Sao Paulo, it's now 19-20 after a dive-smash wins one point, then a terrific block wins the second. Match point.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.36am:</strong> Tim Maitland has emailed: \"Re: 'Liu Xiang's Achilles tendon? Who cares.' While I completely understand that the current union-jack-waving frenzy has awakened those patriotic genes and made you want to tea-party-like-it's-1977... but billions do care.\" It was kind of a joke, Tim, but you next points are fair. \"I'm not sure that the comparison is completely accurate, but you can at least get a sense of perspective by considering what the emergence of the first great black sprinters meant to the African diaspora. Liu Xiang proved that Chinese... think Greater China and beyond, rather than the Peoples' Republic... could run fast. Running fast is sexy. Running fast is modern. Running fast is a sign of the emergence of the Chinese peoples in the 21st century ... When Liu snatched the numbers off his shorts and walked away... most silently did the same ... I've been watching sport for a living for the best part of 25 years, and it was one of the most poignant moments I can remember.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.30am:</strong> It's 10-10 in the second game of the beach volleyball. \"Very disappointed to hear there will be no Aussie-baiting today,\" says Will Sinclair, who was in the thick of it last night, if I remember. \"In it's place, can I suggest we revert to Kyrgyzstan-baiting? A quick review of the medal tally indicates that the small former Soviet state has only won a single bronze, a single silver and NO GOLD! Go back to playing your komuz (a three stringed lute, apparently), you LOSERS! Any Kyrgyzstanians care to mount a defence for their hopelessly outclassed nation?\" I'm not holding out a lot of hope for this, but the challenge is there.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.23am:</strong> Oliver Pattenden has written one very, very long sentence, and then a short one, which is a textbook set-up/punchline format if ever I saw one. Get your chuckle boxes round this: \"I was about to write you a sincere email about how fed up I am with the degrading way the women's beach volleyball players (and their bikinis) are always discussed, and how it's a sport these players and their fans take very seriously, and that the comments of retrograde sexists who seem attracted purely to an article of clothing, are demoralising are not only demonstrating the pathetic level of ignorance of most sports spectators (and a fair few journalists) but are really undermining and disrespect the athletes in a way I really don't think they'd appreciate. Then I realised that Brasil's women are wearing tops with 'BRA' across their chests, which isn't really helping my point is it?\" He's here all night.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.19am:</strong> \"That's it! That's it!\" The first set in goes to the American duo of Kerri Walsh and Misty May-Treanor. They take it 21-12.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.17am:</strong> I have just watched \"the play of the tournament\" in the beach volleyball, which has left me cold for something so magnificent. The Brazilian duo won it, and have got it back to 10-18 in the first game/set/rubber.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.15am:</strong> Late-night stalwart Andrew Jolly (for whom it's actually the middle of the day, since he's in Australia) has been totting up what we can hope for from Team GB!GB!GB! for the rest of the games. \"Laser sailing; men's madison; men's individual sprint; women's individual sprint, womens BMX, mountain bike, triple tump, and women's 400m. Have I missed anything?\" Well, there's some horsey stuff, in which we're sometimes good for a bronze, and out men's triathletes have got an outside chance, apparently. That said, our outside chances in the women's event yesterday came 21st and nowhere.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.10am: Beach volleyball:</strong> This is the women's semi-finals, by the way, between Brazil and the United States. I'm guessing it's live, in which case the score is 10-5 to USA in the first game, but it might be recorded, in which case .... USA won 2-0.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.08am: Beach volleyball:</strong> Straight in and straight into the beach volleyball. I've never gone crazy for this, since I have previously seen bikinis before, and also have access to the internet, where there are all kinds of things to see, so I'm told. Happy that it's on today, though, because it gives me the perfect excuse to quote New Yorker writer Anthony Lane, who said: \"Beach volleyball is to proper volleyball what Elvis's movies are to Elvis's music,\" <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/08/25/080825fa_fact_lane\">among 5,000-odd other words on the Games that I advise you to read</a>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1.55am:</strong> Here we go again, here we go-go-go to the temple of consumption. It's day 11 at the Games of the XXIX Olympiad in Beijing, and it's going to be another thriller.</p> <p>Over the previous 10, Her Majesty the Queen has received a huge boost to the drafting of her New Year's honours list, with a 12-gold-medal haul for Team GB. The future MBEs, CBEs, Knights and Dames of our proud nation have surpassed the expectations of even the most jingoistic cab driver. Liu Xiang's Achilles tendon? Who cares. Team GB has biked, sailed, rowed and swum the gold into our souls, and we're loving it.</p> <p>Today, the fun starts with the <strong>men's triathlon</strong> at 3am BST, about an hour from now. Do two outside chances make a genuine chance? Who knows, but son-of-former-football-referee-Philip-Don <strong>Tim Don</strong>, a former World Champion, is going, as is British champion <strong>Will Clarke</strong>, whose father never officiated any top-level football match, unless you know different. Emails are always welcome. <strong>Alistair Brownlee</strong> is also wearing the Team GB colours, but he doesn't have a Wikipedia entry.</p> <p>Much later, <strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong>, <strong>Mark Cavendish</strong>, <strong>Victoria Pendleton</strong> and <strong>Chris Hoy</strong> go in the velodrome, and Paul Goodison is off again in the men's laser (sailing). Bikes and boats=British bounty. On the track, <strong>Christine Ohuruogu</strong> goes in the 400m, and there also some dressage.</p> <p>All kind of other events featuring athletes not from these shores will be grudgingly squeezed into the other 19 hours of this live report. Stick with us.</p> <p>Please share your thoughts by emailing here: <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>, although Aussie-baiting is taking a rest day. (Unless there really is nothing else)</p> <!-- Block 1 --> <p>Howard will be tapping away right here from 1.55am.</p>"
