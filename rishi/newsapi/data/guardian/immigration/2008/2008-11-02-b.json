  "<p>Barack Obama entered the final hours of the longest and most expensive election campaign in American history in an upbeat mood today, voicing Democratic confidence when he said the party has a \"righteous wind at our back\".</p> <p>Obama's campaign team predicted he would break the traditional pattern of US politics to take long-established Republican states. The RealClearPolitics average put Obama on 50% to rival John McCain's 43%, a lead that, if replicated in Tuesday's election, would produce a landslide.</p> <p>The McCain camp came out in force too today to argue that the Republican was still in contention, and that it would be a mistake to write him off. \"What we are in for is a slam bang finish,\" McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, predicted.</p> <p>Nearly two years after it began, the closing 72 hours of the epic battle between Obama and McCain saw both camps making an exhaustive effort to win over the diminishing camp of undecided voters, and get the faithful to the polls.</p> <p>In a last blitz of battleground states, Obama returned to the promise of a new kind of politics that has defined his campaign. </p> <p>\"If you give me your vote on Tuesday, we won't just win this election \u2014 together, we will change this country and change the world,\" Obama said in the Democrats' national radio address.</p> <p>After defeat in the 2000 and 2004 elections, the Democrats, buoyed by polls numbers, were increasingly prepared to abandon the nervous hesitation about voicing in public their hopes that they were finally on the verge of victory. The Democratic senator Chuck Schumer told CBS television: \"Wednesday morning Dems are going to be very happy.\"</p> <p>David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, was also optimistic, telling CBS he was cheered by the surge in early voting which favoured Democrats. \"The edge is pretty substantial in our favour,\" Axelrod said.</p> <p>In Colorado, a once-Republican state where Obama now leads, some 46% of the electorate have turned out for early voting. North Carolina, an even more strongly Republican state, is also showing heavy early voting in favour of the Democrat.</p> <p>\"We feel good,\" Axelrod said. \"It is not just the polls. It is the early voting ... These figures are are coming in strong for us, reversing the traditional patterns.\" </p> <p>The Obama campaign manager, David Plouffe, said it had deployed a record number of volunteers over the weekend to knock on doors trying to get supporters to the polls on Tuesday.</p> <p>The Republicans, while admitting the odds were against stacked against them, insisted McCain will close the gap in the final hours. \"John's a closer. He always has been,\" Fred Thompson, the Law and Order star and former rival for the White House, told NBC television. ''He often is given up for dead - literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I think the election has yet to be decided.\"</p> <p>However, last minute polls provided little evidence to support Davis's claim that the race was tightening. McCain has been behind Obama in all of the more than 250 polls conducted since late September.</p> <p>Karl Rove, who masterminded Bush's campaign in 2000 and 2004, was less optimistic than the McCain team's public pronouncements. McCain has \"a very steep hill to climb\", Rove told Fox.</p> <p>McCain has so far kept his promise - in spite of pressure from some of his advisers and his running mate Sarah Palin - not to make race an issue by using tapes of Obama's former pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright.</p> <p>The Republican party today paid for a series of robocalls - taped phone messages - in key states quoting Hillary Clinton from when she stood against Obama for the Democratic nomination, saying he was inexperienced and the White House was no place for \"on the job training\".</p> <p>McCain's team, outspent in advertising by Obama almost every day since the campaign formally began early in September, said in an email to supporters today it would match him on the eve of election. \"In the final days of the campaign, our television presence will be bigger and broader than the Obama campaign's presence.\" The McCain camp said it would outspend Obama by $10m in the coming hours. </p> <p>McCain devoted most of his final hours trying to shore up support in traditionally Republicans states. While he held an event today in Pennsylvania - his main Democratic target on Tuesday - the Republican was also forced to return to states that had been in the Republican fold in 2004.</p> <p>His itinerary before polling day called for trips to Florida, Ohio, Missouri, and even Tennessee, with a last swing through the Rocky mountain states of Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico before returning to his home in Arizona late tonight/Monday.</p> <p>Obama, meanwhile, held a rally on Saturday in Springfield, Missouri, one of the mostly staunchly conservative corners of a state won comfortably by George Bush in 2004. </p> <p>He was campaigning in Ohio today, with appearances in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus. After stops tomorrow in Florida and North Carolina, he plans to end his campaign with a huge rally in northern Virginia, a traditionally Republican state that is one of his top targets on Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of civilians forced to flee makeshift camps during a rebel advance last week began returning to their home areas in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo today as aid workers struggled to assess the scale of humanitarian help needed. </p> <p>From dawn, the road out from the main regional town of Goma was lined with families trudging northwards towards Kibumba, where many of them had been staying in a displaced persons' camp until a few days ago. Rebels from Laurent Nkunda's National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), patrolling the now-empty camp, told people to return to their houses as security was now assured.</p> <p>There were similar scenes in other areas captured by the Tutsi rebels, who declared a unilateral ceasefire on Wednesday night after advancing to within a few miles of Goma. </p> <p>The rebel surge, which caused the Congolese army to capitulate, forced more than 100,000 people on to the move. Since the start of skirmishes in August, 250,000 people have been displaced in eastern Congo. David Miliband, the foreign secretary, who visited Goma yesterday, described the humanitarian need in the region as \"absolutely pressing\".</p> <p>In a joint statement with the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, who is also on an emergency visit to the region, Miliband said: \"There is no excuse for turning away. The international community must support humanitarian delivery, strengthen the United Nations force, and help promote and enforce agreements.\"</p> <p>But Miliband, who also travelled to Rwanda to urge the authorities there to help resolve the conflict, played down the possibility of an EU force being deployed, or of British forces being sent. Instead he suggested that more of the 17,000 UN peacekeepers situated throughout Congo be moved to North Kivu, where the current fighting is centred. Currently barely one third of the force is in the region.</p> <p>The ceasefire has enabled many of the international aid workers based in Goma to return to Congo after evacuating last week when the rebels closed in. In Kibati, seven miles north of Goma, where 70,000 people are sheltering, UN forces are now patrolling and some food has been distributed. But with the security situation further north uncertain, aid organisations are finding it difficult to reach victims of the fighting. </p> <p>Erna van Goor, head of mission in Goma for Medecins sans Frontieres, one of the few agencies not to withdraw its staff last week, described the humanitarian situation in North Kivu as \"very confusing\", and said there were still no accurate figures as to how many people were in need. </p> <p>\"We are not looking at a catastrophe yet, but the situation is very, very serious. We know there is a urgent, large requirement for food, water, medicine and shelter.\"</p> <p>The UN refugee agency has expressed concern at reports that several displaced persons' camps had been forcibly emptied, looted and burned in areas captured by the rebels. In the strategic town of Rutshuru, where Nkunda's troops installed a new administration yesterday, promising to improve living conditions for the local population, there were also reports of people being made to leave camps and return to their homes.</p> <p>Peter Smerdon, a spokesman for the World Food Programme, said UN agencies would travel to Rutshuru tomorrow for the start of an assessment mission, and then move into other CNDP-held areas. </p> <p>\"At the moment it's uncertainty over the security status that's making things difficult. We have got sufficient food stocks in Goma for an initial response to the displacement, but it's a matter of getting it to the people in need,\" he said. </p> <p>Nkunda, who claims to be fighting to protect the minority Tutsi population in eastern Congo from Hutu militias linked to the 1994 genocide, is widely thought to be receiving assistance from Rwanda, which is also frustrated at Congo's failure to disarm the Hutu rebels.</p> <p>A meeting between Kagame and the Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, to discuss the crisis has been tentatively scheduled to take place in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi this week. </p> <p>In an unrelated incident in north-east Congo, up to 50,000 people fled the town of Dungu following an early raid yesterday by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) that left nine people dead. </p> <p>Having being driving out of Uganda, the LRA rebels are meant to be negotiating a peace deal, but have instead taken to launching attacks from bases in South Sudan, Central African Republic and Congo.</p>",
  "<p>Maverick laughster John McCain delivered a game-changing November surprise last night with an appearance alongside Tina Fey on Saturday Night Live, chuckling about how his campaign has no money.

  "<p>When Michelle Obama gets into trouble, it's because she's too warm, too strong, too real. If Cindy McCain is disliked, it's because she's too icy, too breakable, too fake. Obama offers the controversial 'fist bump' as a greeting; McCain has to wear a wrist brace because of a handshaking injury. </p> <p>The two candidates' wives couldn't be more different and the contrast between them has provided yet another media-friendly dimension to a presidential race that hardly needed added zest.</p> <p>While the Republicans have been running an 'Ordinary Joe' campaign, Cindy McCain wears Oscar de la Renta and five-carat diamond earrings. (Her net worth is a reported $100m; her income for 2007 was $4.2m.) In the week when Sarah Palin's campaign-funded designer trousseau made headlines, Michelle Obama went on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and, while extending her sympathy to Palin for the sartorial scrutiny she was experiencing, said she herself was wearing 'a J Crew ensemble' she'd bought online with her own money. (Michelle Obama's entire outfit can now be purchased in the J Crew sale for under $300.)</p> <p>Even with Hillary Clinton and Palin to suggest that the political landscape is more complicated for women now, these are still the questions that count for a prospective First Lady: What does she wear? How does she smile? Has she taken his name? Does she have a job?</p> <p>Cindy McCain is a first lady in the old mould - mould being the operative word. Standing just behind her husband at every stop on the campaign trail, she seems pale, remote, and stiff to the point of automation. 'Stepford' is a word that has been linked to her frequently; matters aren't helped when she appears not so much to have departed from a script, as blown a fuse. </p> <p>She said that Mother Teresa 'prevailed upon' her to adopt a Bangladeshi orphan with a cleft palate; it was later discovered that Mother Teresa was not there when McCain visited the orphanage. She said she'd been to Rwanda during the genocide; it turned out she'd been to Zaire after the violence had ended and looked over the border. </p> <p>A serious addiction to prescription painkillers, that led her to steal from her own charity and cause people who had helped her to lose their jobs, has been turned into a recovery success story. Cindy, according to a friend of the McCains, would 'walk on broken glass barefoot' if it would help her husband in his campaign - virtually the same words Jackie Kennedy used about her successor, Lady Bird Johnson.</p> <p>Michelle Obama, on the other hand, has been quick to tell us about her husband's morning breath and his failure to take out the rubbish. Earlier this year, she was considered an unpredictable, potentially dangerous factor in the campaign ('Will Michelle Obama Hurt Barack?' was a question asked on the cover of Time magazine last summer). Right wingers labelled the fist bump she exchanged with her husband at the Democratic National Convention a 'terrorist fist jab'. She said she was proud of her country for the first time, and that went down as profoundly unpatriotic. Her domestic anecdotes were having a questionable effect on his popularity. Yet she has turned this tricky reputation around, campaigning on her husband's behalf when he visited his dying grandmother in Hawaii, and overtaking her Republican counterpart in every opinion poll. </p> <p>Most important, she has done more than 'humanise' the candidate, as is traditional: she has actively bolstered his identity in the public imagination. He is a mixed-race half-Kenyan who was brought up in Hawaii and needed to seem less foreign to voters; she is an African American who grew up on the South Side of Chicago, then went to Princeton and Harvard and became a lawyer.</p> <p>These women's plans for the future are as distinct from each other as their performances on the campaign trail would suggest. Cindy McCain, who dislikes Washington, has suggested she would, as First Lady, attempt to emulate Princess Diana - she supports some of the same charities, and is keen to devote herself further to global philanthropy, a full-time prospect she and her husband have disagreed about in public. </p> <p>Michelle Obama, who has focused on addressing working women, has no illusions about keeping the high-powered hospital executive job she's scaled down in order to get her husband elected. Careful not to seem like another Hillary in the East Wing, she voices modest hopes. 'When people ask, \"what kind of First Lady will you be?\",' she recently told Vanity Fair, 'I'm going to try, in all this, to be honest, hopefully funny and share important parts of me with people, hopefully in a way that will help them think about their lives and avoid the mistakes we may have made in our lifetime.'</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>'s campaign to become the first black American President was rocked yesterday, only 72 hours before election day, by the revelation that his aunt is an illegal immigrant in the US.</p> <p>News about Obama's relative is a chance for the McCain campaign to generate some last-minute negative headlines about Obama. Four years ago Zeituni Onyango, 56, who is mentioned in Obama's personal memoir, was instructed by a court to leave the country after being denied political asylum. However, she now lives in local authority housing in Boston.</p> <p>Illegal immigration is a political minefield in US politics and the story could be a vote-losing headache for Obama. Her refusal to leave the country does not make her unusual in America - there are an estimated 10 million 'illegals' - but the issue is a hot button one, especially with the white working-class voters courted by both Obama and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>. </p> <p>Illegal immigrants are often accused of taking jobs and government services from US citizens and legal residents. Onyango, Obama's half-aunt on his father's side, has donated to his campaign, with five small gifts totalling $260. Those donations may turn out to be illegal, since Onyango is not a US citizen. His campaign said in a statement: 'Senator Obama has no knowledge of her status, but obviously believes that any and all appropriate laws be followed.' </p> <p>The revelation came as McCain cut Obama's lead in the polls and police forces in major cities made extra security preparations for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">election day</a>. </p> <p>In Chicago, Obama is holding a rally downtown after the polls close on Tuesday night and it is believed that up to a million people could flood the city's streets. All police leave has been cancelled and off-duty firefighters have been told to keep their kit ready at home. The unspoken concern among some is that a surprise Obama loss - especially with most polls predicting a win for the Democrat - could lead to civil unrest.</p> <p>Detroit and Los Angeles were also deploying extra police out of concern for the potentially heightened emotions raised by this election. Yesterday McCain was nudging into a slight lead in one element of a three-day tracking poll by respected pollster John Zogby. The overall survey still gave the victory to Obama by five points, but McCain was a point ahead on the third day.</p> <p>The poll found that McCain's support was increasing among independents and working-class voters. It could prove that McCain's recent tactic of pushing blue-collar issues, symbolised by his adoption of 'Joe the Plumber' as a campaign totem, is working. Though other surveys have shown McCain starting to close on Obama, virtually every other national poll recently suggests Obama has a healthy lead.</p> <p>Whether it is Obama or McCain who enters the Oval Office, the military burden on Britain of fighting in Afghanistan is expected to be eased, with the US demanding that other European nations provide more resources ahead of an expected offensive against insurgents.</p> <p>A source close to the Defence Secretary, John Hutton, said both McCain and Obama appeared prepared to tackle the problem that 'the UK and the US both punch above their weight, certainly in terms of numbers of troops on the ground'. Gordon Brown has hinted to Labour MPs worried about the human cost of a military surge in Afghanistan that he will be able to provide more reassurance shortly.</p> <p>The Prime Minister is expected to speak to the President-elect this week, while dozens of Labour party staffers and Commons aides have taken unpaid leave to volunteer for Obama. A Democrat victory would boost Labour morale.</p> <p>Senior Tories argue, however, that an Obama victory could help David Cameron, by proving political inexperience is no bar to the highest office. Several shadow cabinet ministers privately back the Democrat over the older, less sure-footed McCain.</p> <p><strong>\u2022</strong> Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin last night told a comedian in a prank call that she could be President - but not for another eight years. In the telephone call, to be aired on a Quebec radio station tomorrow, comedian Marc-Antoine Audette, posing as French President Nicolas Sarkozy, tells Palin that she would make a good President. Laughing in response, Palin says: 'Maybe in eight years.' After discovering she had been the subject of a hoax, Palin was said to have been 'mildly amused'. </p>",
  "<h2>I used to travel through India ... </h2> <p>With Bailey [David, Helvin's former husband] staying in places with toilets that didn't work and blood on the walls from people swatting the bugs. I never want to experience that again. Bailey loved India and we'd go back and forth. I've had dysentery so many times I can't tell you. Every time I went I got it, even though I didn't touch the water. Bailey used to make me brush my teeth with Scotch and drink half a tumbler just before bed. He'd say: 'That will kill anything in your stomach.' Thank you, Dr Bailey. </p> <h2>I didn't go overseas ... </h2> <p>Until I was 16. I grew up in Hawaii and back in the '60s it felt really remote. I remember we used to say: 'When are we going to get off the rock?' There's a term for how we felt - Polynesian paralysis - you just feel so isolated. </p> <h2>My first vacation ... </h2> <p>Was to the Big Island in Hawaii to watch the Kiluaeu volcano erupting. I was six and it was incredibly scary. My dad was a helicopter pilot so he took the whole family over there and we flew over it. </p> <h2>My idea of paradise ... </h2> <p>Would be staying on a deserted motu in Tahiti at an amazing hotel called Le Taha'a. A motu can be so small that it's barely an island, it might only have one palm tree on it, and at that hotel they face an island famous for vanilla, so it smells sublime. Vanilla is an aphrodisiac, so the entire time I was there, all I thought about was sex and I was alone. I couldn't believe it. </p> <h2>My favourite travelling partner is ... </h2> <p>Me! I like to travel alone. I've done it with parents, friends, boyfriends and husbands and I prefer to be on my own. I like to do my own thing. If I want to lie naked for 10 days, perhaps the other person won't be into that. I like very remote places and I don't think many people are into places really off the beaten track.</p> <h2>The worst holiday I ever had ...</h2> <p>Was in Mexico. We'd stop at these dingy cafes and there would be people running across the road chasing chickens and that was lunch. Bailey would get stuck into it, but I lived on omelettes for 10 days and was miserable. I thought Mexican food was all fajitas and tacos, washed down with margaritas. </p> <h2>My last holiday ... </h2> <p>Was to Alaska and I'm planning to go back. It's the most beautiful place. I was on a ship and I'd look out of the window and could see whales breaching. I saw brown bears, eagles, sea-lions and it was just unbelievable. I like to forget about my real life and pretend that I'm a wilderness girl and wear the lumberjack jackets and hats. I went to Glacier Bay and there are some really interesting hippies up there, running kayaking trips up to the glaciers. For as far as the eye can see, there is nothing but wilderness. </p> <h2>I like to go five-star...</h2> <p>But I like to rough it too. The place I went to in Tahiti is five-star, but my other favourite hotel in the world is in Maui in Hawaii and that's not too glitzy. It's called the Hana Ranch and I like to go there and ride. They have about 2,000 head of cattle and you can get a beach cottage and just go out on the coastal trails. </p> <h2>I always take ... </h2> <p>My camera. I like to take lots of pictures but otherwise I want to travel light. It's more important to me what I don't take; I always leave my mobile at home. I hate being contacted on holiday. </p> <h2>I always bring back ...</h2> <p>Food! In Thailand I buy coconut jam, in Hawaii it's rock salt or honey and in Tokyo I get sauces. I also bring back cat snacks that you can't buy in London.</p> <h2>My most memorable meal ...</h2> <p>Was in Russia. They served the vodka in tumblers and I've never had so much caviar in all my life - that was all we ate. </p> <h2>The ultimate travel luxury is ... </h2> <p>Flying by private jet. Dodi Fayed was a friend and he used to take me on his private Lear jet to LA when he was going over there. He would keep me company for 30 minutes over a glass of champagne then he would go in the bedroom, take a pill and disappear until we got there. </p> <p>\u2022 Marie Helvin's autobiography is out now in paperback (Phoenix, \u00a38.99)</p>",
  "<p>Jena raises a glass of rich red wine. 'Saqartvelos Gaumarjos [Victory to Georgia],' he says. The table is heaving with food, a banquet is laid out, yet the women are still preparing extra on the wood-burning cooker. An endless stream of toasts follow - to the gods, to saints, to love, and friendship - each delivered with exuberant passion. My face has a warm glow from the fire. The drinking and toasting continue. It's late, and I attempt to slope off to bed. 'Ah no,' Jena, says. 'You must have one more.' Welcome to Georgia, where the feasting never ends and the hospitality is unsurpassed. </p> <p>Drinking toasts has been part of Georgian culture for centuries. I have come here to sample the traditional supra, or feast - literally 'tablecloth', because of the huge spread of dishes, covering the entire table. I am sitting in the kitchen of Jena Ghvitziani's house in the mountain village of Becho, in the northern province of Svaneti, high in the Caucasus mountains, where medieval towers protrude from the valleys. This area was previously unsafe for travellers, with armed muggings a regular hazard, but regular security patrols have improved the situation and the Svans could not welcome tourists with wider arms. </p> <p>Tourism is important to Georgia, but was hit badly in August when long-simmering tension over the breakaway region of South Ossetia escalated into a full-scale conflict between Georgia and Russia. Things have quietened down now and the country is currently safe for visitors, except for the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The last of the Russian soldiers have finally left, replaced by unarmed EU observers - much to the Georgians' delight. 'We will not be beaten,' Dato, my guide, says triumphantly. Because of Georgia's strategic position on the world map, on the Silk Route at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, it has been attacked for centuries - by Mongols, Byzantines, Persians and Arabs. But Georgians are immensely proud of their resistance, and their country.</p> <p>The road to Svaneti from Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, is pot-holed and bumpy; we pass horse-drawn carts and Soviet-style apartment blocks before arriving 10 hours later in Becho. Jena's old stone farmhouse has dahlias and apple trees in the garden, a rickety truck in the yard, and onions hanging from the verandah. Lela, Jena's wife, in apron and black headscarf, knocks apples from a tree with a long stick. </p> <p>I'm staying at Jena's house, having arranged with Wild Frontiers, the adventure travel company, to do a 10-day walk in Svaneti, sleeping each night in family homes in villages along the way. Our driver, Gia, transports our bags, so they are waiting for us each evening. At each house, I am the only guest and the rooms, though simple, are clean and cosy. The nights are cold and I try to avoid night-time visits to the bathroom because usually they are in outbuildings. </p> <p>Georgia is the land of milk and honey, where orchards burst with fruit and people still have an attachment to the land - their food is all home-grown. In Svaneti semi-wild pigs root for acorns in the forest, making their meat taste divine, the honey is infused with the scent of wild flowers and families make cheese from the milk supplied by their cows. Svan cooking is dictated by its mountain terrain: there are no shops or markets, so food is produced seasonally. Autumn, when I visit, is a time to gather, store and dry, in preparation for the cold winter. </p> <p>Next morning Dato and I wake early and after a hearty breakfast of blinis, homemade apple jam, khachapuri (bread with baked cheese inside), yoghurt, pear muraba (slow-cooked fruit) and fresh peach juice, we head off to visit the glacier on Mount Ushba. This magnificent two-pronged mountain watches over the village, snowy peaks glinting white against the azure sky. All around is a parade of autumnal trees, a dazzling blanket of colours - buttercup yellow, tantalizing greens and toffee-apple red - creeping up the mountainsides. Along the way we feast on wild blueberries, raspberries and hazelnuts and scoop up water from rushing mountain streams.</p> <p>The climb is steep but at the top, high in the clouds, it is ethereal and moody - the distant valley below peek-a-boos through the drifting mist and the waterfalls drop torrentially fast. The cows wear big bells and the tinkling gives the place an Arcadian feel. That evening we have another feast of kubdari (stewed beef in bread), shusha (cream of potatoes and cheese), home-made sausages, plum sauce and aubergines spread with walnut paste. Jena's six-year-old daughter starts reciting Georgian poetry, with such vivacity it nearly moves me to tears. Shots of delicious, sweet-tasting raki, home-made from bread and stored in a glass bottle with tarragon, are handed round with gusto. </p> <p>Our next destination is Mestia, a long day's climb away; crickets chirp and the sun is shining. 'Ketevan [my name in Georgian], we are so lucky with the weather,' says Dato. 'Autumn is unpredictable, often with rain, but if the sun is here it is one of the most beautiful times, with the mountains covered in snow.' </p> <p>We picnic by some shepherds' dwellings. They're empty now, but during the summer the shepherds live here with their herds. Beyond here is the Guli Pass, where the snow is untouched. At the top I feel jubilant, seemingly standing on the roof of the world, with a shawl of mountains, rising defiantly from the valley, surrounding me. As we climb down the other side, the setting sun soaks the trees gold and a glistening auburn. </p> <p>Mestia is full of medieval stone towers, standing tall and slender. Georgia's centuries-old need to protect its territory led the Svans to build these emblematic towers. Svaneti, however, hidden away in the mountains, managed to escape many of Georgia's invasions: because of this, treasures from other regions were sent here for safe keeping, and a museum was built in Mestia in 1936 to house them. It boasts ornate altar crosses, illuminated manuscripts and icons of gold and silver. </p> <p>From Mestia we walk to the village of Adishi; Mount Shkhara, Georgia's highest mountain at 16,600 feet, dazzles in the distance and Ushba looks across the valley at Mount Tetnuldi. 'The legend goes that these mountains were lovers whose love was thwarted by their parents so they turned into mountains, meaning they could forever look at each other,' Dato says. It is glorious sunshine and families are out making hay. Helped by his son, one man, gold teeth glinting, places a wooden harness across the necks of hefty oxen and attaches a wooden sleigh, with a haystack perfectly shaped on top. This is then dragged off down the mountainside, looking like Dougal from the Magic Roundabout</p> <p>Walking around Adishi is like stepping back to medieval times, a tumbledown jumble of houses and towers, many broken and in desperate need of restoration. We are staying with Jora, an unshaven man, who explains: 'Previously there were 34 families living here; now there are only eight. The others left because the road is shut for six months by snow, completely cutting us off to the outside world. We had buses during the Soviet Union, but now they are gone.' </p> <p>The village is a maze of crooked wooden verandahs and gingerbread lacing. An old lady with a crinkled face collects firewood, and her sister, washing the dishes outside in an old bath, hands me an armful of plump green apples. </p> <p>Inside Jora's house, most of the windows lack glass and pigs and chickens run around the yard. The main living room is like a cosy Victorian parlour, with women dressed in black baking bread over the fire. The whole family gathers in the enveloping warmth; washing hangs in the corner and there are two beds where the children sleep. That evening, at the big, hand-carved oak table, we eat pork, garlic and rice wrapped in cabbage leaves, fried potatoes, tomatoes stuffed with beef and paprika, and a Svan speciality of cheese and mint. The atmosphere is bacchanalian: the men are smoking and I am embraced in their friendliness, a sea of rugged faces. </p> <p>Toasts are made to the dead, for which some wine is poured respectfully on to the ground. 'After this we will toast children, who symbolise life,' Dato says. There is a pattern to Georgia's toasting - although late into the night the topics become ever freer and more expressive. 'No one should drink while the toast is being made,' Dato explains. He points to a couple of mountain goat horns on the dresser. 'These are used for the most important toasts, when an entire horn of wine must be downed in one.' </p> <p>Conversation flows from the war to the fact that the government is planning to start charging for electricity. 'We are very worried about this because all these villages are entirely subsistent. We don't have money,' Jora says. And for peace to remain it is evident that many Georgians are relying on help from Europe. Dato adds: 'We are almost resigned to the fact that we won't get our breakaway regions back, but it is the Russians who caused the troubles between us and the separatists. If Russia left us alone, we could all live together peacefully.' </p> <p>The following morning we walk to Ushguli, one of the highest inhabited places in Europe. As we approach, hairy pigs snuffle and sniff and the odd satellite dish is the only sign of modernity. Families are digging for potatoes at the foot of towers, men lead oxen up the stony twisting paths and smoke curls from chimneys. Ushguli's towers are all different heights, short and stocky, or thin and tall. In the early evening light their caramel- and nougat-coloured stone smoulders warm against the virgin white mountains. </p> <p>No gourmet tour of Georgia would be complete without a visit to the flat, fertile wine-producing region of Kakheti, bordering Azerbaijan. Wine is an integral part of life in Georgia. Hundreds of years ago the Virgin Mary appeared in a dream to Nino (the woman who first brought Christianity to Georgia) and when she woke she was clutching a cross made from a grapevine - a sign to spread God's word. </p> <p>Wine and drinking has evolved into an embodiment of their Christian faith. Their wine has a distinctive robust taste. It's made differently from the rest of Europe in that Georgians don't separate the grape juice from the skin, fermenting them together instead for several months under ground. Every family in Kakheti produces its own wine in this way, unchanged for centuries. </p> <p>Zurico, a local Kakhetian, is picking grapes with family and neighbours, the boot of his battered Lada full to bursting with the fruit. He hands me a bucket of grape bunches and invites me home for dumplings - and, of course, his delicious home-made wine. After all, this is Georgia.</p> <h2>The 60-second guide to ... Georgia</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Location:</strong> On the dividing line between Europe and Asia, Georgia has a 700-km border with Russia to the north, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey to the south. The country is dominated by the Caucasus mountains, the Likhi range splitting it into eastern and western halves. The population of 4.4 million - more than 80 per cent ethnic Georgians - does not include those who live in the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Government: </strong>Georgia is a semi-democratic presidential republic, with a President as head of state and Prime Minister as head of government. South Ossetia now has its own, Russian-supported separatist government and negotiations have broken down with the Georgian government, which now views the region as annexed by the Russians. There is a similar situation in Abkhazia, which has the status of an autonomous republic, also supported by the Russian government. In August, Georgia's parliament passed a resolution declaring that they were 'Russian-occupied territories'.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Is it safe?: </strong>Although the Foreign Office says that the situation in Georgia, including Tbilisi, is now calmer, it still advises against travelling to South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In addition, it advises against travelling to any areas where troop deployments have been reported, in particular the towns of Poti, Senaki, Zugdidi and villages north of Gori. Demonstrations against Russia are planned and, although intended to be peaceful, are best avoided.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Climate:</strong> Diverse landscapes - mountains, plains, even rainforest - mean the weather is extremely changeable. The west has very wet autumns, snowy winters and cool, wet summers, though lowland areas tend to be warmer. Eastern Georgia has hotter summers, less rain and colder winters because the Likhi mountains block the humid air masses from the Black Sea.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Language:</strong> The official language is Georgian, with different dialects spoken in the East and West regions. Many people also speak Russian, but few will have any English outside the major cities. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Economy:</strong> Until 1991, Georgian industry was integrated with that of Russia; after independence the economy collapsed, but with foreign investment is growing again. The main industries are steel, mining, chemicals and wine.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Kate Eshelby travelled to Georgia with Wild Frontiers (020 7736 3968; <a href=\"http://www.wildfrontiers.co.uk\">wildfrontiers.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>When the balaclava-clad paramilitary police officer pulled back a blanket covering the corpse, a group of women wailed, shielding their babies' eyes. The security guard, whose body had been left outside the 4/9 Minimart in Villa Foresta on the edge of Tijuana, had been shot repeatedly at point-blank range with what appeared to be a semi-automatic weapon, his face and chest grated by gunfire into something more like a raw carcass on a hook. </p> <p>This was body number six last Monday night, and the sixth of what would become a total of 15 people murdered during less than 72 hours in this frontier city that acts as a portal from Mexico to California and vice versa. This is the front line in the 'narco-war' - savage, sanguine and sudden - that drug cartels are waging between each other and with the authorities. The war has claimed some 2,700 lives this year, and more than 6,000 since December 2006, when President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched Mexico's first serious offensive against the cartels who have traded for decades under a measure of government protection.</p> <p>The battle has been fought mainly along the 2,100-mile border between the United States and Mexico, the world's busiest frontier. As the body count has increased, so has the brutality of the killing. Corpses have been found severely tortured or decapitated, castrated, dipped in sulphuric acid or with their tongues cut out. </p> <p>Dr Hiram Mu\u00f1oz, chief forensic medical expert assigned to the homicide department in Tijuana, told The Observer how 'each different mutilation leaves a clear message. They have become a kind of folk tradition. If the tongue is cut out, it means they talked too much. A man who sneaked on someone else has his finger cut off and maybe put in his mouth. If you are castrated, you may have slept with the woman of another man. Decapitation is another thing: it is simply a statement of power, a warning to all. The difference is that in normal times the dead were \"disappeared\" or dumped in the desert. Now, they are displayed for all to see.' </p> <p>Last month 13 bodies with their tongues cut out were found across the road from the Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas secondary school. The principal, Miguel Angel Gonz\u00e1lez Tovar, said: 'It was terrifying, the children were terrified, the staff were terrified. And now we had to suspend some classes after this last warning. They gave me CCTV, but that does not work. They gave me an alarm button, but that is broken. We try to teach here, but we cannot be isolated from what is going on outside.' The illustrated project on the wall of one classroom was about global warming and gave guidance on what to do in a flood or hurricane. </p> <p>The new army-imposed chief of police in Tijuana, Lieutenant-Colonel Juli\u00e1n Leyzaola, talks of 'social terrorism' by the narcos, referring specifically to a threat last Tuesday that, if Marines did not leave town, the narco gangs would kidnap and kill schoolchildren. </p> <p>'All I can do is to increase a police profile in the community and schools, calm people down to avert the kind of social psychosis the narcos want to generate, physical presence to reassure people and intelligence to fight the criminals themselves', said Leyzaola. </p> <p>The war has also struck deep into the heart of Mexico, with macabre executions as far south as Chiapas. The magazine Proceso published a cover photograph of the country's entire political and military leadership under the headline 'Impotence', and concluded that 'the narco is now a national structure'. The leading campaigner against the drug cartels in Tijuana, Victor Clark Alfaro, talked last week about 'a war against society itself, at every level of life, school and community, with violence on the streets and even more sinister movements behind that violence, to create psychosis in society, and criminalise the economy'. </p> <p>The war has also spread into the US, with 135 arrests last month in a swoop against Mexican cartel operatives. </p> <p>The appalling and escalating level of violence is not only a response to Mexico's tardy counter-offensive against the drug gangs, but a symptom of fragmentation among the drug cartels themselves. </p> <p>Last week's bloodbath in Tijuana - taking the year's death toll for this city towards 600 - followed the arrest last Saturday of Eduardo Arellano F\u00e9lix, known better by his 'nom de narco' El Doctor - the last remaining fugitive of five brothers who ran Mexico's oldest, but now severely damaged, cartel. On Wednesday, the US State Department lodged a request for Arellano's extradition for trial in the United States, where he has been among the most wanted drug traffickers. </p> <p>That dramatic swoop on a Saturday afternoon targeted an Art Deco mansion in the upscale Misiones del Pedregal suburb. A deafening salvo of fire was aimed at the villa in what was presumed to be yet another shoot-out. The next day it was shown to have been the taking of Mexico's second most wanted drug lord into custody. He arrived - white-bearded and apparently dazed - for his ritual handcuffed appearance for television to join one of his surviving brothers, Javier, in the high-security Altiplano jail. </p> <p>Authorities on both sides of the border hailed the arrest as a triumph, the US Drug Enforcement Administration calling it the 'final demise' of the cartel founded by Mexico's first drug lord, Angel F\u00e9lix Gallardo, but run by the Arellano brothers since he was jailed in 1989. </p> <p>Others were slower to celebrate. The state of Baja California's new public prosecutor, Rommel Moreno Manjarrez said: 'We hope to be seeing the fall of the Arellano cartel. But we have no illusions that one cartel's misfortune is another's opportunity, and that rivals will be watching this situation in their own way. We are trying to see how this will play out and to battle against whatever moves are made. </p> <p>'We have had a serious problem of police corruption in the past, but are trying to purge this corruption from our forces, and are now able to fight this battle seriously, with the DEA helping in many ways, and with backing from our own government, which is different from the old political situation.' </p> <p>Cocaine trafficking from South America into the US (and much of Europe), and trafficking in Mexican-produced heroin and methamphetamine, became a Mexican near-monopoly during the 1990s, operated by four cartels, each controlling one of four main 'plazas', or routes into the US. </p> <p>The Texan sector belonged to the 'Gulf cartel' and its military wing, Los Zetas, comprised of former crack Mexican troops. A central passage through Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez was terrain dominated by the Ju\u00e1rez cartel and the giant plaza between Tijuana and California by the Arellano brothers and their sister Eneida who, the authorities presume, will assume command of the clan. </p> <p>But a fourth, unspecified, central-western plaza was run by the Alianza de Sangre (Alliance of Blood), or Sinaloa cartel, from the Pacific state of that name, way south of the border, where most of the other big traffickers also originate. This cartel was founded and is led by Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n, who split from Gallardo to rival him, was jailed in 1993, but dramatically escaped in 2001 and is now a fugitive and something of a narco folk hero. Guzm\u00e1n used the 2006 government offensive to lay claim to the entire border. The war that rages in Tijuana is largely between his rebels and those loyal to the Arellano family. Moreno says that an alliance forged in jail between the Sinaloa and Ju\u00e1rez cartels is also 'entirely finished', generating further chaos, and Sinaloa is taking on the Gulf cartel's Zetos with a trained army of its own, Los Negros (the Men in Black). </p> <p>Amid the carnage, a journey with three young women from the police forensic team is a harrowing experience. On the outskirts of Tijuana, another corpse has been found, visible by the green light of a petrol station. The windscreen of the victim's Ford Explorer (with California plates) is pitted with three bullet holes, and he seems to have made a run into the street, followed by 25 further shots. </p> <p>The scene of the next slaughter is the 9/4 minimart in Villa Foresta, where a blanket covers the remains of the security guard, with two more dead inside. There is wild sobbing from the women as the bullet-sprayed body outside is revealed, and those inside the store are brought out on stretchers and loaded into the white forensic department truck now carrying five dead bodies. </p> <p>The shop, it seems, was a stash for drugs being loaded for export in two presumed clavos (nails - the word used here for a car carrying drugs) intended to join the 65,000 that cross from Tijuana into San Diego every day, which the police in time tow away. </p> <p>Meanwhile heavy-set men arrive to look on from a slight distance, embracing each other in a way that suggests burdensome comradeship and solace, but little sadness. </p> <p>Tijuana's residents are struggling, with a remarkable degree of success, to lead a normal life. A recent study among local drug addicts shows an increase from 5,000 outlets and crack houses in 2004 to 20,000 now, and an estimated 200,000 young people in a burgeoning city of three million seriously addicted to hard drugs. Friday's newspapers reported yet another vast haul by the American authorities of 90lb of cocaine, crossing Tijuana's border to San Diego in a car driven by a Mexican burro, or mule. </p> <p>But the city teems with effervescent life for all the 'psychosis' the narcos wreak. The crowds of American tourists have vanished from the famous Avenida Revoluci\u00f3n, so the souvenir business is in trouble. And with the formerly flashy narcos now lying low, Tijuana's famous brothels and strip clubs are empty of all but the worst types, the girls gyrating mainly with one another. </p> <p>But like every other bar, the S\u00f3tano Suizo pub was heaving last Sunday (while Eduardo F\u00e9lix Arellano was airborne, handcuffed), for the climactic football match of the season Mexicans call 'El Cl\u00e1sico' between Club Am\u00e9rica of Mexico City and Chivas of Guadalajara. The teams unleash attack after attack in a tremendous game-to-the-death with Chivas winning 2-1.</p> <p>On Friday, slightly surreally given the week's murders, celebrations were being prepared for yesterday's Day of the Dead, an ancient rite inherited from Mexican tradition, entwining Roman Catholicism with Aztec lore of the 'Black Sun', which illuminates the underworld.</p> <p>The borderland remains a strong, exciting and potent place, in which the vast majority of people live and strive honestly. This frontier is too often defined, as Professor Tony Payan of El Paso university points out in an excellent book on the borderline, not by the people who live, flock to and work here, but by whatever is polemically useful to Washington. From there, argues Payan, successive administrations have illogically and disastrously entwined their failed border 'war on drugs' with the entirely separate 'wars' on undocumented immigration and terrorism. </p> <p>There is a strong sense that the region is paying the price for other people's greed. 'We are,' says Eligio Montes, police commander of Rosarito Beach, south of Tijuana, 'a cultural sandwich here on the border. And now we're squeezed between narcos from Sinaloa and Americans taking drugs.' </p> <p>My companion reporter, Jorge Fregosa, ends another rollercoaster drive on Thursday (to catch the army remove hand grenades from a blue plastic bin in a side street) by saying: 'This is my city, my country and that is my flag' - and he opens the sunroof the better to see it fly, defiantly vast, with its eagle, cactus, snake and legend, in the breeze and in America's face, at the border. </p> <p>'And every time they kill someone,' says Fregosa, who has seen that happen hundreds of times this year, 'it hurts me. because it hurts the place I love. The border pays the price, and now we are paying a higher price than ever.'</p> <h2>War on drugs</h2> <p><strong>December 2006</strong><br>A new federal police force is created to tackle drugs cartels; thousands of troops are deployed as part of a major anti-drug trafficking drive.</p> <p><strong>2008 </strong><br>Drug-related killings soar. Murders linked to organised crime leap to almost 1,400 in first five months of year.</p> <p><strong>May</strong><br>Attorney-General Eduardo Medina Mora says that the number of murders linked to organised crime had risen by 50 per cent, with thousands of people having been killed in the 18 months since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n took office and declared war on drugs cartels - 450 of the dead were police, soldiers or lawyers. </p> <p><strong>August</strong><br>As the murders continue, hundreds of thousands turn out for marches throughout Mexico to protest against the wave of kidnappings and killings.</p>",
  "<p>It's been the biggest fashion story of the year and it's had nothing to do with harem pants, the coat versus the cape, or the alluring comeback of the brogue. An industry not known for its crises of confidence has been forced to ask itself some uncomfortable questions. Might there be something nearing apartheid inside the pages of the glossy magazines and on the runways of the international designer collections? Is fashion racist? </p> <p>The debate - some say long overdue - would not have been kick-started without a woman called Bethann Hardison. The first black saleswoman in the Garment District of New York in the Sixties and a runway model in the Seventies, she spent the Eighties and Nineties as one of the few black women with her own modelling agency (for black and white clients). She's so celebrated in the business that she's known mostly by her first name only, like Naomi and Iman, to each of whom she also happens to be a long-time confidante and mentor. </p> <p>Over the past 14 months she's held campaign meetings in New York to speak out about a subject that has been largely taboo in the fashion industry. These are protest groups like no other - a cross between a rumbustious church service and the coolest party you have ever been to. Here, the likes of Naomi Campbell, Liya Kebede, Iman, Tyson Beckford and Veronica Webb squeeze into a room with some of the fashion world's biggest players such as Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, editor-at-large of American Vogue and designer Vera Wang, as well as casting agents, stylists and representatives from the modelling agencies. </p> <p>At each meeting, Hardison sits at the front and beckons people she knows to stand up and speak. 'I knew I could make things happen,' she says. 'I knew I could make the rest of the industry feel self-conscious about what was going on.' Over the months her audiences revealed a fashion white-out - design houses that hadn't used a black model for a decade; issue after issue of American Vogue without a single black model on the fashion pages. Casting agents who stipulate 'No ethnics' this season. Magazine editors who say black covers don't sell. Caption writers who get the few black models who are successful mixed up. Designers who, out of a total of 30 models, use only two who are black because, 'If it's more than two it becomes a Black Thing'. Black models paid less than their white counterparts. As Iman said at one of the early groups: 'In any other industry it would be racism and you'd be taken to court for it.'</p> <p>Hardison had actually sold her agency and stepped out of fashion, preferring, she says, to lie in a hammock in Mexico and dance salsa with pretty skinny Latino boys. (She is, it swiftly transpires, not a typical sixtysomething. She won't tell me her exact age. 'Not even my doctor knows that!' she hoots.) It was Naomi Campbell who persuaded her to come out of retirement to organise the events. 'Every couple of months she'd ring me and say, \"There are no black girls out there. You've got to do something!\"' </p> <p>Hardison was in a unique position. She'd retired, which meant she had nothing to gain financially. She knew everyone. She was respected and well liked in a business renowned for being fickle and as ingrained with ego and jealousy as a designer logo on a leather handbag. Eventually she decided to act. She emailed Iman. 'Did you realise that, over the past decade, black models have been reduced to a category? Call me.'</p> <p>We sit in her small apartment near Bryant Park in New York, a short walk from the Garment District where she started out working for a button company. Paintings, mostly of black women, line the walls; there's a large framed poster from Andy Warhol's American Indian Series. She is, she tells me, exhausted. Something to do with the fact that yesterday she held another campaign meeting, and that she's fasting because it is the month of Ramadan. </p> <p>What irks her most about the lack of diversity on the catwalks is the fact that 'we'd had it before and it had disappeared'. In the late 70s and early 80s, she recalls, on the back of the black civil-rights movement, catwalks and magazines were often more diverse than they are now; black models were the stars.</p> <p>'Once you've climbed to the top of the mountain you don't expect to be back at the bottom again. It's like once you've seen Paris it's hard to go back to the farm. We had been there. We had achieved all of this' - she sits up straighter, tilting her chin imperiously and I catch a glimpse of how arresting she must have been as a 20-something woman striding down a runway for Oscar de la Renta or Halston - 'and we'd disappeared'.</p> <p>Casual observers might wonder why this issue is important, why anyone cares who's wearing a \u00a32,500 coat in a magazine fashion spread or on a catwalk since most of us will never be able to afford it anyway. According to Hardison: 'Fashion should be a reflection of society. I want my industry to be as modern as the next one. And my industry is the least modern of them all. Fashion isn't just about the way a dress moves.' The concern is that a generation of girls, both black and white, will grow up thinking there is only one - white - benchmark for beauty.</p> <p>It seems astonishing to think that, in two days' time, America may elect its first black president, but the editor of a glossy magazine might still think twice about putting a beautiful black woman on the front cover. Or even, indeed, on the inside pages, thanks to the current fascination with celebrity that means a famous person (usually a white, fake-tanned one) bags the cover slot. Thus the number of new, well-known black or Asian models has shrunk to a handful: Jourdan Dunn, Chanel Iman, Sessilee Lopez, Georgie Badiel. On Forbes magazine's 2007 list of the 15 top-earning models, only one - Liya Kebede - was black.</p> <p>Trying to work out why fashion seems to have gone backwards on diversity is complex.</p> <p>Everyone blames everyone else - model agencies blame casting directors, magazine editors blame readers, designers blame model agencies. The reasons range from the aesthetic to the more insidious.</p> <p>'I don't think in terms of black and white,' stylist Katie Grand tells me. 'I just think about who is going to look best in the clothes.' The fashion designer Katharine Hamnett claims to be baffled by the situation. 'The strange thing is that Caucasian girls actually got the short straw. Very few of them are model material. Black girls and Indian girls have far better faces and far better figures than white girls, period. I remember taking my kids to India and looking out of the bus window and saying, \"My God, this is like a model casting\". Why white girls remain so popular is a mystery to me, whether it's because consumers are mostly white, or aspire to be white, I don't know.'</p> <p>In America, where 30 per cent of the population is non-white and where black women spend a colossal $20 billion on fashion and cosmetics, the issue is particularly sensitive. Other American media, including some hit television dramas, reflect a society that is racially mixed, but the fashion industry remains as pale as a partially cooked chicken drumstick. American Vogue, with a readership of two million, has, in particular been criticised for its scarcity of black images.</p> <p>'We still have reactionary forces in this country,' says Veronica Webb, one of the most successful black American models in the Eighties and the first to land a major cosmetics contract for Revlon. 'And they are part of our power base. It's our national ailment. To be told \"no\" simply because of your colour means you are screwed ... And it wasn't even so bad for me because I am very mixed - part black, part African, part Latino.' </p> <p>Nevertheless she recalls being turned down for a job for a leading French design house. 'The photographer, who was a friend, told me the client didn't want their accessories to become status symbols in the black community.'</p> <p>I repeat this story to other black commentators in the industry and it's so typical they don't even sound surprised. Former model Beverly Bond has set up a group for black teenage girls called 'Black Girls Rock', an attempt to attach a slogan to the protest in the same way that 'Black is Beautiful' did in the Seventies. 'I've been to auditions where they automatically turn away the black girls without even looking at their books. It's racist. Imagine them behaving that way if I went to a job interview. It's amazing how far behind the fashion world is and how they can get away with being so blatant about it.'</p> <p>She's given up modelling and become a well-known DJ instead. 'In the end black models get disheartened by it. No matter how hot you look, you are never going to be hot enough.'</p> <p>In July, no doubt partly because of Bethann Hardison's campaign, Italian Vogue published what they called 'a black issue'. Every page of editorial was devoted to black beauty (while the advertising remained almost universally white). It included many of the best black models of the past 30 years, from ground-breakers like Pat Cleveland to Jourdan Dunn, said to be the new Naomi Campbell. (It seems there's little chance of there being room for two very successful black models at the same time.) The result was dazzling, although the website Gawker noted wryly: 'Never has the racism issue looked so stunning.'</p> <p>For the first time in its history the magazine sold out, helped by a campaign on Facebook by black readers starved of the black image for long enough. The issue made newspaper headlines on both sides of the Atlantic. Commentators said it showed, finally, that the black image could sell. Critics noted that the majority of the models were pale-skinned, their hair often slicked back or hidden in a turban. True, black women don't all look the same - and thinking they do is part of the problem - but there were few images of darker skin and natural afro hair. </p> <p>With a circulation of 145,000, Italian Vogue's readership is edgy and niche. Editor Franca Sozzani can afford to take risks. Rivals may have sat up and taken notice but most probably thought, 'Fabulous publicity. I wish I'd thought of that!' And then carried on as before.</p> <p>Some felt that it was too little too late. 'There's nothing I like more than to see beautiful black people,' says Rebecca Carroll, author of Sugar in the Raw, about black teenage girls in America, 'but it felt a bit like black history month - \"Now we've done it we don't have to worry about it again\".' Black stylist and fashion editor Edward Enninful disagrees. He worked on the issue: 'I'd love it if fashion was 50/50 between black and white. But you have to think in terms of baby steps. In the end little drops make an ocean.'</p> <p>Whenever designers and stylists enter the debate many talk about the cyclical nature of the business and how trends come and go. However, even if this is the case, change is achingly slow. Katie Grand worked on five shows last season and struggled to find the quality of black models she wanted. 'I think the agencies could do more,' she says. 'I saw every girl but there were very few black girls.' At Louis Vuitton, out of a total of 54 models, she used only four that were black. </p> <p>At the recent collections in September Chanel still had no black models; nor did Yohji Yamamoto, Giorgio Armani, Marni or Jil Sander. </p> <p>Balenciaga, Gucci, Christian Lacroix and Prada had one each. The vast majority used just two or three (at least, everyone said, it was better than last year) although many were only seen on the runway once. Jean Paul Gaultier and Vivienne Westwood, famously fans of a mixed cabine, broke through the 20 per cent ceiling. </p> <p>One up-and-coming designer, Sophie Theallet, stood out - her whole show was made up of only black models. It was a success but, as she tells me: 'I told nobody beforehand - only my husband and the people closest to me at work. It was too risky. I didn't want anyone telling me it was not a good idea.' And this in a spring/summer collection when, as Bethann Hardison points out, black models traditionally do much better. 'The bright colours against the dark skin ...' she says, rolling her eyes. When she was an agent she used to ring up the design houses and say: 'You know we do wear clothes in winter time?'</p> <p>People in the fashion and media industry who know Bethann describe her as an icon. Admittedly fashion has its fair share of luvviness, but watch her at her meetings and the affection people feel for her is obvious. Both inspiring and outspoken without being self-righteous, she's able to rouse and provoke in equal measure, poking fun at a business that she clearly loves but one which takes itself rather too seriously at times. </p> <p>However, her background had little to do with designer shops on Madison Avenue. Hardison's father, a practising Muslim, was a supervisor in the local housing authority. After her parents separated she was looked after by her mother and grandmother who were domestics in Brooklyn. 'You've got to leave Brooklyn,' she says, 'to be proud of where you come from.' Her mother loved the local bar scene, dancing and dressing up - 'Though in those days, the Fifties, everybody dressed in the same silhouette, whether they were black or white.' </p> <p>Hardison fell pregnant at the age of 18 - 'I had never had sex before and I got pregnant on the first time, which is the worst thing in the world.' When her baby son, Kadeem, was small, her mother and grandmother looked after him (he grew up to become a successful actor, based in Los Angeles) and for a while she had a mixture of jobs working at a telephone company and in a prison before she found a position in a firm that made hand-painted buttons for design houses.</p> <p>She'd inherited her mother's sense of style. 'That first day I wore a white straw hat, a one-off white suit, slingback shoes. The owner was worried I'd get covered in paint so he decided I could be the one to take the buttons to the designers.' It would be true to say she never looked back. Hardison worked her way up through an industry that back then was focused on a few streets in midtown Manhattan. She was an assistant for a dress company, which meant she was secretary, receptionist and book-keeper. Finally two Jewish women who ran a salon allowed her to be the first black saleswoman in the Garment District. The idea of a white woman with money to spend being shown the collection in the showroom by a black woman was unheard of.</p> <p>Hardison's hair was cropped short, as it is now. She was also very skinny. 'Boy was I skinny! Big eyes. I looked like I was from Biafra.' Her unusual look came to the attention of some of the designers she met at work. 'I wasn't a pretty girl but there was something about me that attracted them.' </p> <p>Her debut as a model was in the early Seventies for a designer called Chester Weinberg. The audience, made up of industry buyers, was wholly white. 'They looked stunned. I looked like a little African girl. There were a few other girls of colour but they had a sort of bounce about them. I was just straight.' By the third outfit the uproar was so loud, she could barely get to the end of the room. 'I was dying inside. I wanted to walk right through the door onto the subway and go home. But somehow I kept my head up and it became a point of defiance. I wouldn't let them see how much they hurt me. That became my style. They had never seen anyone who looked like me but that defiance changed the way models could look.'</p> <p>It wasn't long before black models were in demand. 'They called us the black stallions. Black or white it didn't matter. It was a great time because it was so creative and stylish and bohemian. You didn't have to have lots of money to be at the party.' Sensibly - and Hardison, you come to realise, has a very sensible head on those shoulders - she never gave up her day job. By this time she was working as a design assistant. She knew everyone from the Studio 54 crowd to Truman Capote, Jerry Hall to Woody Allen, but, as she says: 'There wasn't a lot of bullcrap then. All you had to do was have interesting dinner-party conversation.'</p> <p>A man once told her she was too busy to be committed to a relationship and, though she was married twice, neither marriage lasted long. In the Eighties she decided to start her own modelling agency. She found premises in the then unfashionable SoHo area of New York. 'As a black businesswoman you can't believe anyone is taking you seriously because you have no one before you who has done what you are doing. It's like walking down the Yellow Brick Road before it's been laid.' She would run the agency for 21 years and set up a pressure group called Black Girls' Coalition with Iman. By the time she sold up there may not have been parity between white and black models but she imagined she'd done enough.</p> <p>The industry changed with the influx of Eastern-European models. Bewitching-looking women: tall, translucent, angular, with flinty cheekbones and piercing eyes. 'They flooded the market,' says Carole White, who owns Premier Model Management. 'They are beautiful, but it is a bland beauty. It's a certain look. We can all spot it.' As a reaction to the reign of the supermodels, labels like Jil Sander and Prada wanted anonymous faces. 'It was almost as though they were revolted by what they had created,' says Michael Gross, the author of Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women. According to Hardison: 'The model was reduced to a coathanger.' </p> <p>Of 200 models on White's books, only seven are black or Asian women and she says they have to work twice as hard to get the jobs. White thinks that fashion has become dominated by a white aesthetic that goes beyond the designers. 'Photographers used to be apprenticed for five years. They would learn about lighting and printing,' she explains. 'The thing is that now they probably use digital cameras and don't know how to light a black girl. It's the same with make-up artists. Black make-up artists like Pat McGrath work magic on white models but you don't see it the other way around. It's probably ignorance, and they are probably frightened. They just don't know how to do it.' </p> <p>There is an unspoken presumption that white readers want white models, white women only want to see an image of themselves on the catwalks. It's what academics call 'the white hegemony' and it's so casual if you're white you don't even notice it. But might the pundits be talking down to their consumers?</p> <p>'Editors say customers won't have it, it won't sell,' says Barbara Summers, a black model in the Seventies and the author of Black and Beautiful and Open the Unusual Door. 'But it's self-defeating. They're projecting their own failure and using black people to make the excuse. It's just cowardice. The irony is that the industry is shrinking in the current financial crisis. It can't grow again if it stays stuck in these past ideas. You can't expand your customer base if you only make products for white girls.' </p> <p>The result, according to Rebecca Carroll, is black teenage girls growing up thinking that they're not admired, a sense that goes beyond what they see in the mirror. 'It's painful,' she says. 'No one likes to be excluded and they grow up thinking they don't exist, therefore people don't care.'</p> <p>Even if one goes along with the view that Italian Vogue was, as Enninful says, 'historic and monumental', look through this month's bunch of British monthly glossies and you'd be hard pressed to find any black images. Editors often maintain that the number of black models they include proportionately matches the population. However, in this month's British glossies, the main fashion spreads are universally white. </p> <p>When you do see black models in magazines the same tropes are repeated again and again, says Zoe Whitley. She is a curator and visiting fellow at Sussex University, whose MA thesis was about blackness in Vogue. In mainstream magazines there is traditionally a proliferation of leopard-print and other animalistic symbols. Certain postures are popular - crawling, leaping in the air and smiling. There are lots of accessories and jewellery and colours that deliberately show up the contrast between fabric and skin - vivid reds, turquoise, white. 'The stories can be stunning,' says Whitley, 'but you don't often get a sense that you'd see a black model in a story about tweed, or a muted palette.' </p> <p>The alternative is to create an atmosphere of exoticism by putting a white model in a foreign environment like an African country or India. 'She becomes exotic and they don't even have to resort to using a black model.'</p> <p>Whitley has a theory that, when a black image is used on the front of a glossy magazine it is often in February, traditionally the lowest-selling month anyway. 'The poor sales become a self-fulfilling prophesy.' As a young woman growing up in Washington and Los Angeles, her family would rush out to buy any magazine with a black person on the front. They imagined they could boost sales single-handed.</p> <p>The lack of black images prompts some commentators to wonder whether magazines are interested in black readers at all. Fashion is a business and like all businesses it goes where it thinks the money is. 'This is a commercial industry,' says Michael Gross, 'run by a bunch of old people. Their job is not to change the world, it is to sell frocks. It's not racism. It's not even unconscious racism. It's an utter cluelessness about the real world.'</p> <p>There is a view, though, that if Senator Barack Obama does win on Tuesday, the response will be profound, even on cosseted, inward-looking Planet Fashion. Michelle Obama has wowed the industry with her fashion instincts. She's already reinvented the way a potential First Lady can dress. She might soon be the most sought-after woman on any glossy magazine front cover anywhere in the world. True, she's not a model but it could mark a sea change. 'It will be a wake-up call,' says Gross. 'The reaction in the fashion business will be a blatant and almost laughable attempt to catch up. Such is this craven industry and such is the way they behave.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>Brightblack Morning Light<br>Motion To Rejoin (Matador) \u00a310.99</strong></p> <p>Anyone sorely missing the narcotic languor of the old Spiritualized should buy a copy of Brightblack's third record immediately. In theory, an album recorded in an adobe dwelling in the New Mexico desert using only solar panels doesn't spell blissed-out decadence; neither does the Utopian hippie-speak of the lyrics. But Brightblack draw from the same heady well of Southern soul as Jason Pierce used to. And the stunning combination of Rachael Hughes's cloudy Fender Rhodes piano, singer Nabob Shineywater's multi-tracked whisper and some dazed horns makes for an addictive experience.<br><strong>Kitty Empire</strong></p> <p><strong>Grace Jones<br>Hurricane (Wall of Sound) \u00a311.99</strong></p> <p>The disco diva's first album in almost 20 years has been preceded by festival<br>appearances and press interviews so fantastically bonkers that it's a mild anticlimax to find her treading well-worn Jones territory on record. Reggae grooves skank, she growls threatening sweet nothings, and despite the eccentricity on display, first impressions are at best nostalgic, at worst parodic. But these tracks work a slow-drip charm; opener 'This Is' delivers terrific, edgy funk, 'Hurricane' has Jones's vocals swooshing in like the titular storm, and there's a rarely glimpsed vulnerability to 'I'm Crying (Mother's Tears)'.<br><strong>Ally Carnwath</strong></p> <p><strong>Girls Aloud<br>Out of Control (Fascination) \u00a312.99</strong></p> <p>With umpteen hits and glowing reviews to their name, Girls Aloud (or production stringpullers Xenomania) could be forgiven for reaching creative exhaustion. Certainly, their fifth LP begins wearily; 'The Promise' rides the Sixties soul bandwagon to unpromising effect, while the Pet Shop Boys-penned 'The Loving Kind' is almost indistinguishable from 2007's 'Call<br>the Shots'. Mostly, though, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is swept aside by their insouciant charm and iron-clad hooks, with the swooshy electro-disco of 'Turn to Stone' and hip-swinger 'Love is the Key' proving highlights. They remain a potent pop force.<br><strong>Hugh Montgomery</strong></p> <p><strong>Littlejoy<br>Littlejoy (Rough Trade ) \u00a311.99</strong></p> <p>The latest Strokes side project is the sound of a New Yorker succumbing to the California breeze. With his band on hiatus, drummer Fab Moretti headed to LA for a change of scene and hooked up with fellow songwriters Binki Shapiro and Rodrigo Amarante. Littlejoy does have the odd Strokes moment ('Keep Me in Mind' contains traces of Manhattan garage-rock DNA) but the sunny harmonies and gentle bossa nova flourishes suggest that relocation has had a heady effect. The songs are over before they've begun but each leaves a warm, uplifting impression. A carefree summer album at odds with the season of its release.<br><strong>Killian Fox</strong></p> <p><strong>Harry Beckett<br>The Modern Sound of (On U Sound ) \u00a312.99</strong></p> <p>Beckett's trumpet and flugelhorn have been a constant on the British jazz scene since the 1950s but here he ventures into new territory, exploring dub grooves with producer Adrian Sherwood. This proves a startling success. Sherwood keeps the ambience restrained and slinky while Beckett plays long lyrical lines interspersed with fiery outbursts. Joining the Barbados-born horn player are talents like Orphy Robinson, while Sherwood throws in a couple of turns from the late reggae singer Junior Delgado. The album occasionally recalls Miles Davis's funk experiments, though it could only be a British-Caribbean fusion.<br><strong>Neil Spencer</strong></p> <p><strong>Joe Zawinul<br>75th (BHM) \u00a315.99</strong></p> <p>This double CD, recorded live at last year's Lugano Festival, catches the unique, multi-ethnic Zawinul Syndicate in its full glory. A bewildering but delightful mixture of world music and high-tech electronics, this seven-piece band comes close to achieving Zawinul's aim of sounding 'like folk instruments that haven't been discovered yet'. His own keyboard playing is as inventive and surprising as ever, and the band is joined by Wayne Shorter on soprano saxophone for a notable version of the classic 'In A Silent Way'. The concert was on 7 July , Zawinul's 75th birthday. He was terminally ill and died less than two months later.</p> <p><strong>Dave Gelly</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Matt Stinson, 30, is a psychotherapist. He lives in north London and has a partner.</strong></p> <p>I was bored one hot summer afternoon and went on Gaydar. Patrick's messages were witty and caught my interest. I ended up driving over to pick him up. Really dodgy, I know. We spent the next two days together.</p> <p>I'd always thought I was attracted to the tall, dark and handsome brooding type and Patrick was short, pale and a bit cheeky. The fact he was so different from me was definitely part of the attraction. He would talk about some random celebrity he'd interviewed and I would tell him about some young pregnant refugee who was about to be deported. </p> <p>After six months together, both our flatmates were moving out and it just made sense for me to move in with him. It was too quick really. That's when our differences really came to a head. I'm a bit of a clean freak and let's just say he's not. I did a test on him and put a cotton bud behind the toilet to see how long it would take for him to find it. After about two weeks I couldn't stand it any more and had to throw it away. He never even knew it was there. </p> <p>Patrick was very extroverted and had a big social network. It was great for me. Being American I'd only known my friends here for a short time, and we would spend Christmases together with his family, which I loved. His little niece would call me Uncle Matt. It was so different from my own family. Once we visited my mother in New Jersey and she wouldn't let us stay in her house. She's always been fine about me being gay in theory but not in practice. I think the idea of her gay son and his boyfriend was too much.</p> <p>I was training to be a psychotherapist at the time and you have to do your own therapy. One of the things I learnt was that I have a tendency to try to please people and make them happy at my own expense. Patrick loves being looked after and I like looking after people, so we were a great match. But ultimately that was part of the downfall. I ended up resenting it. I felt like I was carrying two people on my back.</p> <p>We'd been together almost four years when I decided to go home to America for three weeks alone. Patrick was really upset. I think he felt I was abandoning him. It was a really soul-searching trip for me. I saw my family and met up with my first boyfriend in Washington. Patrick would phone me up at inopportune times and want to talk and we would end up arguing. When I came back I was dreading seeing him. That's when he knew it was over. We split up about a week later.</p> <p>Patrick does have a tendency towards hypochondria - he'll have a cold and convince himself it's pneumonia - so when he started calling me months later saying he felt terrible I thought it was just him being ridiculous. Some people said he was just depressed because we'd broken up and he was trying to manipulate me. Then we discovered it was a tumour and it was very serious. It was hard because the whole reason we'd broken up was for me to find my own life and not look after him and that's exactly what I was doing. But this time it was a conscious choice whereas before I felt I was doing it on autopilot. </p> <p>People were very judgmental when I told them we were moving back together. I've lost a few friends. It's so different from when we lived together before because we have our own lives and are our own people. When we were a couple I felt there was so much pressure on me to make him happy all the time and now I'm just responsible for my own happiness. I've been seeing someone for about four months. When I eventually told him I live with my ex, he was actually fine with it. I don't think Patrick's jealous. I'm not sure how I would feel if it were the other way round though.</p> <p><strong>Patrick Strudwick, 31, is a dating columnist and journalist. He lives in north London and is single.</strong></p> <p>When I first saw Matt's picture online he was doing this ridiculous over-the-top pout into the camera. I thought he seemed like a bit of a laugh and quite possibly a superficial idiot. Either way he was hot. He told me later he thought I looked happy and uncomplicated in my profile. How wrong we both were.</p> <p>He was the one who pursued me. He can be very persistent when he wants something. I was reeling from a destructive relationship that had broken up so I was quite blas\u00e9 about it. I found him really calming to be with. It was a slow-burning kind of love. It took a few months before the L word was used. No one had ever listened to me in the way that he did and actually remembered what I said. Like I would casually mention I liked a certain brand of chocolate and the next time I saw him he would drop an armful on my lap. It was impressive to the point it was almost too much. </p> <p>He comes from a working-class New Jersey background and I'm from a liberal middle-class Home Counties background, but we had a similar take on the world. He's also very sarcastic which is rare for an American.</p> <p>I'd never lived with a boyfriend before. We would cook for each other and curl up on the sofa. In my early twenties I was a big party animal and Matt was the perfect antidote to that. I'd become cut off emotionally and he really softened me. He's such a giving person. I'd never felt so safe. My family absolutely adored him. He became like another son to them. It's a hard task being as good a person as Matt and I never managed it.</p> <p>Apart from the fact I am apparently the untidiest person in the world, one of the major issues was his constant need to look after me and of course I loved it. When he went to America on holiday I remember being really upset because somehow I knew I really was saying goodbye. When he got back it was obvious something had shifted. He became very withdrawn. We talked for hours, both crying, but I never fought to keep him. I knew it was the right thing for him to be on this own.</p> <p>I didn't realise how devastated I was until he moved out. I threw myself into buying my first house, just to distract myself really. After a few months I started to get ill. I had no idea what it was at first. I remember calling him when I was really sick and passing out on the phone. He called the ambulance and came with me to hospital. I was diagnosed with an intestinal tumour. I couldn't have got through the next few months without him. He did everything for me, bringing me food, staying up all night with me in hospital and keeping me calm. </p> <p>There were a lot of raised eyebrows when he moved back in with me but I didn't care. I'd had a series of disastrous lodgers and I needed someone I could rely on. And he's my favourite person in the whole world. In many ways we're happier now than when we were 'together' together.</p> <p>It felt like we were partners in crime, both talking over our horrific experiences dating other people and having a laugh about it. It's strange now seeing him with someone else - particularly as it's getting serious. His new boyfriend is really nice and everything I couldn't give him.</p> <p>I've started writing a relationship column, which has became strangely therapeutic. Dating can be quite a lonely experience, particularly when it doesn't go well, and it helps to turn it into something funny. I made Matt promise not to read it. He doesn't need to know the full graphic details I go into - if I knew he would read it I couldn't write it. In the same way if I was having sex I wouldn't ask him to come and watch. It's too close to the bone.</p>",
  "<p>For sale: four-bedroom detached bungalow, some work needed, cost: $800. The catch? It's in Detroit, home to the once mighty Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, and not many people want to live in the Motor City now that the American car giants are laying off tens of thousands of workers. </p> <p>The bungalow is not the only bargain basement property up for grabs: thousands of others are on the market for $10,000 or less. One estate agent who has sold 50 properties - mostly foreclosures - in Detroit is trying to remain upbeat but admits: 'It is a blue-collar town like a lot of other American towns, but it has been hit harder than most.' He says there are houses are going for $5,000 while homeowners next door are struggling to pay a $60,000 to $70,000 mortgage on an identical property. 'It's obviously devastating for them.'</p> <p>The Detroit property market and the US car industry are mirror images: both are in freefall. Speculation is mounting that the government is planning a bail-out of the giant 'Detroit Three'. On Thursday, Presidential candidate Barack Obama added to the clamour, calling for a doubling of the $25bn in government loans recently approved by Congress to help the industry make more fuel-efficient cars.</p> <p>Washington is also said to be trying to engineer a merger of GM and Chrysler as analysts predict that the latter's new owner, private equity firm Cerberus, could pull the plug on it. Without dramatic government intervention, analysts predict all three companies will run out of money some time next year. </p> <p>This side of the Atlantic, the mood of car manufacturers is less grim. But not by much, as they fear they could be next in line: car makers are slashing production across the board to cut costs as sales slump. In the UK, Japanese firm Honda last week said it would cut output by a tenth - 32,000 vehicles, rather than 22,000 as previously planned. All the other five major carmakers in the UK - Toyota, Nissan, Jaguar/Land Rover, Ford and GM - have made similar moves, putting workers on four-day weeks and getting rid of overtime and agency shift workers. No one knows how many 'temporary' production cuts will be made permanent, or when - as will surely happen - jobs are shed along with output. </p> <p>The clamour in Europe for some kind of bail-out is also growing as car makers ask why the banks should get all the help. On Wednesday, the European Commission said that up to \u20ac40bn (\u00a331bn) of 'soft loans' could be provided to the industry by the European Investment Bank. Ostensibly, like the US plan to provide $25bn, this would help companies retool their factories to meet tough EU legislation being proposed to cut carbon emissions from new cars. But if the industry wasn't in crisis, it is unlikely this money would be on the table and, if approved, it would be a bail-out in all but name.</p> <p>It's hard to exaggerate the scale of the crisis facing the Detroit Three; in many ways, they are in a more parlous state than the banks. In 2000, the high-water mark for the industry, the combined stock market value of Ford and GM was more than $130bn. Today, you could pick up both for $10bn and still have change. Citigroup analysts estimate that the pair are carrying $69bn of debt between them. Since 2005, the companies have been haemorrhaging money: in the first half of this year they lost almost $30bn. Paul Newton, analyst from consultancy Global Insight, says: 'The big three are in severe trouble. The past couple of years have been a bloodbath.'</p> <p>And how did they get themselves into this mess? More than any other incumbent car makers, they've been outwitted by nimbler, more efficient - and cheaper - foreign rivals. Twenty years ago, more than two-thirds of cars made in the US were manufactured by GM, Ford and Chrysler. This year, according to the Centre for Automotive Research, for the first time foreign car makers, led by Toyota, will overtake them. </p> <p>The trio have also been hamstrung by the ruinous cost - estimated at $100bn - of providing healthcare for two million current and former workers. Last year, a landmark agreement with the UAW union capped these liabilities, but the damage had already been done. </p> <p>That was not all. Soaring fuel prices have soured Americans' love affair with big, powerful 'sports utility vehicles' and boosted sales of smaller cars - more typically made by the big three's rivals. When the credit crunch took hold a year ago and property sales plummeted because of the shortage of credit, car loans also began to dry up. In response, the three companies have announced plans to close 35 plants, mostly in the area around Detroit, with the total loss of 100,000 jobs. GM and Ford are looking to expand operations in lower-cost places, such as Mexico, China and Africa. </p> <p>But this restructuring, huge as it is, already looks hopelessly inadequate to stem their ballooning losses. With recession looming, credit, for the few people contemplating buying a new car in these straitened times, is even harder to come by. The financing arm of GM recently announced lending restrictions which, dealers estimate, would prevent almost two-thirds of would-be GM buyers from finding a loan, and Chrysler has made similar moves. Toyota plans to take advantage, according to Citigroup analysts, by offering interest-free loans on 11 models, which will only hasten the decline of the Detroit Three. </p> <p>Citigroup predicts a 35 per cent sales slump overall in October compared with last year, with GM and Chrysler even worse hit as they withdraw credit. US car sales will pick up - most analysts predict a recovery in 2010 - but to what extent the big three will benefit is unclear. PWC estimated in September that they planned to cut production by about one million vehicles by 2012, but this may not be enough. </p> <p>Newton says: 'The question is whether the big three can cut jobs and close factories, particularly in the US, quickly enough to offset their losses. Their current restructuring plan is based on last year's industry forecasts. However, the outlook is far worse now. It's touch and go.' </p> <p>He also doubts whether the rumoured merger of GM and Chrysler would do more than delay the inevitability of further plant closures and job losses by a couple of months. </p> <p>Summing up the apprehensive mood among car makers in Europe, Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault-Nissan, said recently: 'We don't know if we're at the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning.' </p> <p>European car makers no longer look on at the plight of the big three with the sense of detachment they had a year ago: the question now being asked in boardrooms across the continent is: 'Could it happen to us?'</p> <p>The situation is certainly tough in the UK, but the news isn't all bad. We never had a 'big three' anyway and the last 'national champion' - Rover - collapsed some time ago. Last week, Ford announced plans to invest \u00a370m in its Bridgend engine assembly plant and BMW is building a new electric Mini at Oxford. Even if EU legislation on carbon emissions is watered down or delayed, as the industry wants, the trend towards more fuel-efficient cars will benefit the UK's Japanese car makers, who tend to make smaller, more efficient vehicles.</p> <p>But the last remaining Ford and GM plants in the UK are more vulnerable. There is a big question mark hanging over the future of Ford's Southampton Transit van plant and GM's plants at Luton and Liverpool. Both companies have a lot of capacity all over Europe and may want to retrench to their German bases. How the UK's Jaguar/Land-Rover, bought by Indian conglomerate Tata last year from Ford, can also halve its gas guzzlers' emissions is not clear. </p> <p>In mainland Europe, particularly France, Germany and Italy, car makers can count on government intervention to help them ride out the storm. British car makers aren't so lucky. PWC estimates UK annual production will fall by around 12 per cent to 1.5 million vehicles by 2012. This is a larger fall than predicted for the UK's European counterparts - France (8.6 per cent) and Germany (where a 3.7 per increase is forecast).</p> <p>The crisis gripping the big three and the alarm growing among Europe's car makers will, in effect, only hasten the inevitable: the shift of production to countries where costs are lower, primarily India, China, Russia and Thailand. </p> <p>Who will emerge from the biggest shake-out in the industry's 100-year history to lead the march into the new markets is not clear. But don't bet your house - even if it's in Detroit - on any one of the big three taking the honour.</p>",
  "<h2>Tobias Wolff</h2> <p><strong>Celebrated novelist and memoirist. His latest short story collection, Our Story Begins, was published in August. Won the 1985 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for The Barracks Thief (1984)</strong></p> <p>Last week I was roused from sleep by a strange dream - that my bearded, hairy-backed, happily married older brother Geoffrey, now 70 and up to his eyeballs in grandchildren, had decided to get a sex change. My mentioning this to anyone who knows him has unfailingly produced peals of laughter. All right - dreams are funny, when they're funny. But imagine waking every day to the dream that George W Bush is your president.</p> <p>I simply can't, as Justice Scalia has advised, 'get over it'. As I grind my coffee to the morning newscast and the image of our confident president appears, the bile rises in the gorge, boiling over into tantrums and rants and declarations of despair that, even in the moment, strike me as clownish and pitiable, and are certainly viewed by my family in that light, until they join in.</p> <p>No, I can't get over it, and neither can my friends, hard as we all try. When we meet for dinner we do our best to take up other subjects - books, gossip, movies, our children - but then, like the addicts we've become, we sneak back to the drug of outrage, shooting up the latest barefaced lie and squalid revelation, not forgetting to list yet again the national and global catastrophes brought about by the incompetence, hypocrisy, muddleheadedness, venality, truculence, mendacity, callousness, zealotry, machismo, lawlessness, cynicism, wishful thinking, and occasional downright evil of the administration of George W Bush. Our economy is in freefall, our public school system a disgrace, our military exhausted, the wounded and traumatised dying of neglect, yea, the very earth groaning for relief - and he's optimistic! Yessiree! Looking forward to it! Leaning toward us over the podium with that exasperated little squint and that impatient, dentist-drill voice, utterly at a loss as to how he got saddled with a nation of such gloomy Guses and crybabies.</p> <p>Eddying around our own indignation again and again, as if caught in some Bermuda Triangle of complaint, we are unable not to remind each other of the fatal character of George Bush's incomprehension, the thousands upon thousands who have died by his blithe actions and inactions, and his inability to understand at any level - political, moral, emotional - the terrible damage he has done, this man whose idea of sharing in the grief of parents who've lost a son or daughter in Iraq is to give up playing golf! If he really did.</p> <p>There - I've stepped in the trap again. I can't help it. And for many of us that has been a defining condition of life in George W Bush's reign, this unanswerable need to register anew and aloud our shock and dismay, indeed our disbelief, at finding him at the wheel as we wake each morning. </p> <p>Was it ever so? Nixon, especially in his last months, inspired fits of revulsion, but never incredulity that he had achieved the office in the first place. Same with Johnson. They were at least very smart, and deeply experienced. </p> <p>So how did George W Bush do it? On the face of it, such a man getting himself elected President of the United States would seem an impossibility - this party boy, this tangle-tongued, failed businessman who always managed to save his own bacon while his investors went under, this tough-talking supporter of the Vietnam war who hid out in the Texas Air National Guard when his turn came to serve. Karl Rove's strategic exploitation of social divisions and resentments deserves some of the credit. The Supreme Court, to be sure - Bush vs Gore. Chicanery at the polls and a lot of dumb luck, most notably in the form of 3,000 old folks flummoxed by a confusing ballot. All this and more. But there had to be something else, a meta-narrative if you will, that established him in the hearts of the large minority who voted for him in 2000 and the decisive majority who returned him to power in 2004. And what else could that have been, but what it always is with such empty shirts? Nostalgia. </p> <p>In short, he presented himself as a man of the past - that star-spangled past when it only took one ranger to quell a riot, and you drove big cars without getting sneered at by sissies on bicycles, and you could make a few million without having to divvy it up with the lazy pathetnoids next door; when neighbours talked over the fence and could depend on each other, and the rivers ran straight and clear and teeming with trout, and you could dredge them for gold without the government breathing down your neck, and the trees were really big and you could chop them down, and you won wars, and men wore hats to work and meant what they said, and nobody was gay, and the queers all lived in New York, and you could say under God and have a Christmas tree on the town green without people in turbans and sidelocks getting up your nose about it.</p> <p>That was the America we think we grew up in, and we want it back, and George W Bush, with his down-home voice, and gunslinger swagger, and no-nonsense contempt for the complications of a modern society, gave clear promise of a right of return to that good and simple past. That was his appeal, in both senses of the word. And in this one thing, alas, he was sincere.</p> <p>He wants the fictional past to become the actual present. </p> <p>This might be risible if he weren't President. But he is, and it isn't, because he has resolutely declined to prepare for any future he doesn't approve of, say the one where his war perversely ignores the script, and 4,000 young Americans get killed, and 40,000 more come home with wounds to their bodies, and still more thousands return with wounds to their minds and souls that may never heal, and find themselves, for lack of any foresight at all, in understaffed, rat-infested hospitals and psych wards, while the people we claimed to be saving are killed and crippled in even greater numbers - numbers unknown, because it has been our stated policy not to count them. George W Bush wouldn't countenance that future. Or the future where we start running out of oil. Or the future where glaciers disappear and McMurdo Bay starts looking like a good bet for a Club Med. Or the future where our economy begins to melt into foreign hands. Or the future where foreign hands begin to refuse our economy. </p> <p>We have been in dire need of someone who could adapt to, even, within reason, anticipate manifestly changing conditions in this country and the world at large. But we have had George W Bush, who views change as illicit, even as betrayal, and will not compound the betrayal by any change in himself. And under his unmoving hand you can feel the country straining to move forward, like some great engine shrieking toward the breaking point as the driver presses the pedal to the floor but refuses to shift from neutral into gear.</p> <p>Of course he could not have staged this astonishing performance without support. I'm not speaking of Rove, Cheney, Rice, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld, Feith, Perle, Gonzales, Ashcroft, Bremer, Tenet, 'Scooter' (!) Libby, David Addington and John Yoo and the rest of that scabrous crowd of armchair warriors, perjurers, torturers, and fools. No, they didn't put him in office; the American people did. 'My fellow Americans' - to use the term by which every lying speech is prefaced. And the fact of his election, as much as the incessant abrasion of George W Bush's misgovernment, oppresses me with embarrassment and, I confess, a certain despair for our future.</p> <p>Yes, embarrassment - because his electors really are, after all, my fellow Americans, and I have always wanted to believe in their basic good sense, as I want them to believe in mine. That trust is in fact the very ground of a democratic society. Yet enough of my fellow Americans played the sucker to give this man two terms as President. Amazing! In truth, you never saw such a transparently smug, happily ignorant, unread, unthinking candidate for high office, let alone this office. Surely his unsuitability was plain to everyone. It should have been - he had a nearly unbroken record of personal unreliability and professional incompetence going into the first election, and by the second his record was perfect. There was simply no good argument to be made for his election, and every good argument to be made against his re-election. What did he have to offer, after all, beyond nostalgia? The bribe of lower taxes, already proven to be a sham for all but the richest few, and the continued sacrifice of our young people and our dwindling resources in a deceptively-undertaken and stupidly-executed war. By no reasonable standard could my fellow Americans, most of them anyway, see him as representing their interests. But they voted for him anyway. Why? Because Jesus is his 'favourite philosopher'. Because they felt more comfortable with him than with either of the serious, substantial men who opposed him. Because they'd rather have a beer with him!</p> <p>As the old saying has it, the turkeys voted for Thanksgiving. </p> <p>And though it is snobbish of me to say so, elitist and undemocratic, I will say that the embarrassment I've been feeling for the last seven years proceeds exactly from that sense of my fellow Americans cheerfully volunteering to be plucked, gutted, bled and hung upside down. It has made me embarrassed, as of some public foolishness by one's family, and it has made me vindictive. When I see someone being rude to a waiter, or blocking the road in a Ford Expedition, or yakking loudly on a cell phone in a crowded elevator, I naturally assume they voted for George W Bush. And - this is really mean, I know, really unfair and unreasonable and inhumane, and I scold myself for this, believe me, but - when a tornado tears off a few roofs in Texas, I think, serves you right! And I have friends in Texas. That's some of what the last seven years have done to this writer.</p> <p>Well, boo hoo, what did I expect? Didn't Jesus, and Chuang Tzu, and Shakespeare, and Mark Twain, and my other favourite philosophers all warn me about politics and politicians? Aren't I a little old for all this gnashing of teeth? I am, I am, and I fear I have years more of it ahead of me, because even now the mud is flying, and the fear machine is humming, and we're on our way back to the past.</p> <h2>Edmund White</h2> <p><strong>Novelist, short story-writer and critic, best-known for his autobiographical novels, which include A Boy's Own Story (1982). Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. </strong></p> <p>I moved back to the States from France 10 years ago and soon after my repatriation (after 16 years in Paris) Bush was elected. Although I am perhaps the least political person I know (the first time I voted in my long life was against Bush in the last presidential election), nevertheless a bad president has a depressing effect on the entire culture, no matter how strenuously one ignores him. As a gay man who has always felt that society at large despises me and that I'd be considered a criminal by most of my fellow citizens, I've never wanted to participate in electoral politics - or politics of any sort. I remember that during the Watergate trials I dismissed the whole brouhaha as 'their scandal'.</p> <p>But I had known two moments of political euphoria - Mitterrand's election and Blair's. I was in Paris for the first with French friends who were delirious, and for gays there were immediate benefits. Mitterrand acknowledged that the gay vote had helped him and he dissolved that part of the police force that was supposed to run after gays having sex in the parks at night. I was at a book party that Martin Amis and his wife were giving for me the night Blair was elected, and again I felt the exultation and got caught up in it. Unfortunately, both men turned out to be corrupt or seriously misguided.</p> <p>With Bush it was a different matter. Here was this grinning, supercilious frat boy who'd adopted a fake Texas accent (his family is from Maine), who'd managed to be 'born again' in order to attract the votes of the Christian Right, who'd been responsible for more public executions of criminals than any official in recent memory, who denied global warming, who'd evaded military service but was soon enough sending thousands of American soldiers to their deaths. Here was an oaf who wanted to give the president of Germany back rubs - which she angrily rejected - and who surrounded himself with the most blatant emblems of corporate greed in American history. During Bush's watch in the last eight years there have been four major disasters - 9/11, Iraq, Katrina and the Wall Street crash - and Bush has responded slothfully to each one. He started the war, he bungled the post-hurricane relief effort, and the deregulation that the Republicans fought so long and hard for has produced the crash.</p> <p>Perhaps the most depressing moment in the last eight years was Bush's re-election. As a teacher, I've long lamented the dumbing down of America; now I was tempted to see our educational failure as a plot to keep the electorate stupid and gullible. In America, a tiny elite receives a rigorous education and the rest of the population is kept in darkest ignorance, just as a small percentage of our youngsters constitute Olympic champion athletes and the rest of the population is grotesquely obese: a strange idea of democracy. I was prepared to believe that Dubya's first election had been a mistake or a cheat, but the idea that the voters could re-elect him was too grim to contemplate. </p> <p>As a writer, I found the whole climate under Bush particularly disheartening. Funding for the arts and humanities was at an all-time low. Whereas small bookshops have been saved in France by the Jack Lang law, which forbids discounting of books, in America independent bookstores (including the 50 or so gay ones) were wiped out by the big chains, which are now beginning to go under as well, driven out by Amazon. With our passion for deregulation and the freedom of the market, we would never defend the rights of consumers to have community bookstores (which in America are often community cultural centres) alive and well on every corner. </p> <p>After 9/11 the press was at its weakest and least vocal. I'd always been used to the liberal papers in America examining every governmental excess or infringement with a magnifying glass; now no one seemed to be looking. Most people were getting their news online and most newspapers were cutting back or closing down - and more and more of them belonged to Rupert Murdoch. Similarly, all the small independent publishers were being bought up by conglomerates, many of them in no way previously connected to the book industry. More and more titles were being published but in smaller and smaller runs; it seemed that there were no longer any common talking points among Americans.</p> <p>They lived isolated in their suburban houses, looking at hundreds of cable channels, driving through streets empty of pedestrians; America had become the saddest place on earth. The very rich had become even richer and everyone else was considerably poorer. Conveniently for the Republicans, the last great taboo in America is class. No one is allowed to mention it, not even novelists. Whereas British novelists are always beavering away defining ever more minute class differences, American writers can get a sense of contrast only by looking at the Third World. As a judge two years ago for the Granta top 20 American writers under 35 contest, the trend I most noticed is what I'd call the Peace Corps novel. Everyone is writing about India and South America and the Philippines and Vietnam - no one is writing about the big city or rural poor in America.</p> <p>I have a good friend who is a descendent of President Pierce, who was against abolition in the years leading up to the Civil War. Until now he's always been considered the worst president (there are two or three other candidates). My friend is grateful to Bush for knocking out all the competition.</p> <h2>Yiyun Li</h2> <p><strong>Won the Guardian First Book Award for her short story collection A Thousand Years of Good Prayers. Her first novel, The Vagrants, will be published in the UK in February</strong></p> <p>America in the late 1990s seemed a happy place. Or perhaps it was just my exuberant naivety; having recently arrived in the country in my early twenties as a science student, I lived contentedly on a graduate stipend of $15,000 a year, watching network news and sitcoms every night to understand America. One evening I burned my hand while cooking and the next day the nurse at the students' clinic took a look at it and said, 'Honey, what on earth did you do to yourself?' </p> <p>I replied, rather shamefully, that I had been watching the coverage of the Clinton impeachment and wasn't paying attention to the bursting oil. The nurse guffawed and told me that she wanted to be the one to inform the doctor of this accident, as she could not wait to see his face when he heard the story. </p> <p>How bad could a country become when there was so much laughter around? The economy was strong, wars and genocides happened on other continents, and a mother not far from where I lived gave birth to seven babies. The biggest fear, as the turn of the century drew near, was the millennium bug - remember Y2K? - but the millennium arrived with fireworks, and without any disaster. George W Bush became President, but at the time even this looked like a laughable joke to the circle of foreign students living in our apartment building. So we laughed, not understanding how Americans could have made such a decision. </p> <p>Happiness is like childhood, always ending before one is prepared. Two years later I found a part-time job in a lab in a hospital basement, where fluorescent lamps buzzed in the windowless room. I had by then given up my science career for a dream of becoming a writer, and my lab work was simply to pay the bills. My job - rather appropriate for an aspiring writer - was to assist in research on the formation of voice. Twice a week I would go to a cardiology lab, where an exchange scholar from Bangladesh running cardiology tests on dogs would, at the end of the experiments, turn off all the switches that stopped the circulation. The dogs, still warm to the touch, waited to be dissected. </p> <p>My companion at the ordeal was Sanyukta, a PhD student from India whose dream was to become a professor in America. Neither of us wanted to perform the dissection alone, even after we had honed our skills. Having a fellow sufferer did not lessen our individual pain, but we clung on to each other's presence in those days, and walked back together to the basement with plastic bags containing the dog's vocal tissues which we had managed to cut out, and which we later tried to culture in Petri dishes. </p> <p>On other days, when we received a phone call from the autopsy unit alerting us that a human patient had agreed to donate vocal tissues, we would walk across the hospital with a bucket of dry ice, and wait for the precious tissue. It was on those days, when we felt happy that we did not have to open up a dog, that Sanyukta and I began to talk about our lives, and our conversation, inevitably, would turn to America and its present state. Our biggest fear then was that four years of a Bush administration would be a turning point for America. We understood each other's concern well; after leaving our native countries both of us had made the decision to make America home. </p> <p>'Never in history has there been a superpower that could remain a superpower,' Sanyukta liked to say. </p> <p>'For every empire that rises there will be a journey going downhill,' I would agree. 'Take China, for example.'</p> <p>'Take India,' Sanyukta agreed. 'Take Britain.'</p> <p>Toward the end of the next summer I decided to quit the job, which, like America and many of the disastrous decisions the administration had already made, had become depressing. On my last day Sanyukta bemoaned the loss of a companion to the cardiology lab. 'Ask someone else from the lab to accompany you,' I said, but she replied that the Americans in the lab, as dog lovers, would be too sensitive to take over the responsibility. 'The humility of life. That's what I think they don't know. The country has not been invaded and the people have not been ruled by another people,' Sanyukta said. 'Americans don't understand humility.'</p> <p>Bush has remained president for eight years, rather than four years as Sanyukta and I had hoped, and these years seem to have confirmed our fear in that basement lab that America is going downhill. Bad news is prevalent, both from within the country and outside: the national debt, the questionable tax cuts, and now the financial crisis; wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with human costs as high as the monetary costs; disasters of foreign policy and public diplomacy. America, at some level, reminds me of China in the late 1800s, when the country proudly considered itself the Middle Kingdom at the centre of the world. </p> <p>America no longer seems to me to be the euphorically happy place it was when I arrived. This is to be expected, as, after all, I am no longer a young Alice, eyes widened by the discovery of a marvellous wonderland. Still, America, which I consider now as my home, has taken on a soberness that would not have seemed the right mood for the country eight years ago, and perhaps this soberness will accompany America in its ongoing journey, whether it is one that goes uphill or downhill. </p> <h2>Walter Mosley</h2> <p><strong>Renowned for his crime fiction, notably the mystery series featuring detective Easy Rawlins which began with Devil in a Blue Dress (1990).</strong> </p> <p>The reign of George Bush II marks, with its passing, the end of absolute white male hegemony in American politics. Bush, along with his cronies - Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice and Rove - received the strongest hand that could be dealt a sitting president and squandered the potential for true personal, party, national and international advancement. After the World Trade Centre disaster we (Americans) had the sympathy and support of much of the globe on our side. But instead of capitalising on this largesse we declared war on the world and upon our own people - especially the poor.</p> <p>Masquerading as conservative, God-fearing Republicans, Bush and his lackeys sought to shore up the cracks in white male domination through the primary religion of America - capitalism. They empowered the wealthy by eliminating restrictions on how the rich did business, by cutting the taxes of the most affluent, and by sending the poorest among us, those young people who found themselves floundering in the new economy, off to war with vague promises of glory and possible financial support later on.</p> <p>Our soldiers have been killed and maimed, scarred physically and psychologically. Most have seen no remuneration and their homeland is no safer or any more secure. </p> <p>Bush has done many things wrong. Sometimes these transgressions have hurt us but even when we are wounded we learn. We now have a glimmer of understanding why so much of the world hates us and why so many others have disdain for our archaic sense of pride and vacuous moral authority.</p> <p>Knowing something is wrong is the first step toward rehabilitation. The war we cannot win, the job we cannot save, the mortgage we cannot afford ... Much of this can be laid at the doorstep of our lame duck, bailout President. But, to be fair, he has shown many Americans the fallacy of their convictions. We can see now, better than ever before, that business as usual will not see us through.</p> <p>This said, it's hard for me to gauge the positive against the negative of the second George Bush administration. We needed to understand that the old America is gone. We have women and poor people and people of colour that must be added into the equation. We have neighbours that must be heard and questions that must be asked. Without the travesty of the past eight years I don't know how we would have gotten there. I mean, I suppose that Bush could have toned down his response to those he didn't understand; he could have sought a more peaceful coexistence with those that are different. But he didn't have the acuity to achieve a higher goal. And his excuses for his actions have some validity: his constituency placed in power the man they wanted to lead them.</p> <p>But even with all that Bush has done to throw off the balance of our world, some things have changed for the better despite him.</p> <p>The most important change occurred because of our President's conviction that he didn't mind who worked for him as long as they were faithful to his misguided worldview. Therefore he could have two African-American Secretaries of State, one after the other. This action helped to open the door for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And once the door is opened it can never be fully closed again.</p> <p>The black apologists for Bush's lies and Cheney's avarice cleared the way for Obama. Americans, millions of them, are, for the first time, considering somebody other than the white male candidate. This was bound to happen sooner or later but Bush's racial blindness and political irresponsibility, I believe, pushed the envelope a bit faster. </p> <p>Never again will we be the nation concerned only with the liberation and security of the white man's property. It doesn't matter who wins our election. America has changed for good. The people will continue to demand fairness and equality. They will demand that our actions in the world be considered and considerate of different points of view. Black and brown and Asian men and women will throw their hats into the ring, not as brainwashed servants but as people who see us all as a part of that pulsing, bulging mass of humanity that struggles to survive in this ever-growing, ever-shrinking world.</p> <h2>Rick Moody</h2> <p><strong>Bestselling novel The Ice Storm (1994) was made into a film directed by Ang Lee. His memoir, The Black Veil (2002) was also widely acclaimed.</strong></p> <p>'The business of America is business,' Calvin Coolidge, 30th President of the United States, was reputed to have said in January of 1925, just four years shy of Black Friday and the onset of the Great Depression. </p> <p>It's not hard to think of George W Bush mangling some similar perception, though at the time of his own ascension to the presidency in January 2001, Bush hadn't yet been very successful at business. Not if his stewardship of Arbusto Energy or Harken Energy is any indication. It wasn't until Bush became general partner of a professional baseball team, the Texas Rangers, that he made any real money at all. Nevertheless, Bush drank deep of the lessons of American capitalism, as he pointed out himself in December of 2000: 'I understand small business growth. I was one.'</p> <p>This was W as we first experienced him. The President who timidly, awkwardly succeeded Bill Clinton and who oversaw the bitter end of the so-called New Economy. It would be easy to pin all the blame for diminished corporate earnings and emptied tax coffers and a weak dollar and a huge trade imbalance on Bush, but neither was Clinton's administration free of its share of economic bluster, and neither was Clinton shy about transitioning away from investment in the public sector, as with predecessors like Ronald Reagan and Bush the Elder. This part of the march of history George W Bush inherited, the period after the internet stock bubble, which meant that things were already, early in his presidency, grim, unstable, uncertain. According to the only political model he knew, the business model, Bush's newly minted administration immediately moved to invite Kenneth Lay (of the soon-to-be former Enron Corporation) to closed-door meetings with Dick Cheney, as well as to the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. Other CEOs found similar welcome. The hangover from the internet bubble was hard enough to live with, but Bush, by putting all or most of federal operations up for sale, inaugurated an even more challenging epoch. Call it the 'Years of Shareholder Value', since, as Bush often opined, government needed to behave more like a business.</p> <p>After 11 September, though, the sinister legacy of the Bush years has lain in the free-market approach to the war itself, to the war and its aftermath. How quickly after the initial air campaigns and the collapse of Baghdad were Vice President Cheney's former corporate colleagues, Halliburton, and its subsidiaries, engaged in the securing of Iraqi resources for American corporations and their shareholders. Bush then attempted to bring home the same lessons to domestic affairs.</p> <p>The Ownership Society! That was the name for this second term of Bush's America, and it's logical to assume Bush didn't come up with the coinage himself, because how could he have? He has trouble getting through a simple sentence. Probably some staffer, gifted with ad speak, came up with it, coining what was already de facto policy, the notion that the government needs to remove itself entirely from the business of regulation and owning industries, leaving the oversight of corporate capital - as well as derivatives, packaged mortgages, and so on - to an ill-equipped marketplace. </p> <p>What the Ownership Society came to feel like to the overwhelming majority of Americans was feudalism. The modern return of the robber barons. No backstop in the case of catastrophic illness. No backstop in case of corporate malfeasance. No backstop in the case of a despoiled natural environment. No backstop in the case of cascading corporate bankruptcies. The wealthy and the large corporations, now largely unregulated, were free to do as they wished in most if not all areas, in order to increase the bounteous riches of their executives. If only the barely getting by worked harder and saved more, they too might count on the American Dream coming true in their own lives! If not in this generation then in the next!</p> <p>Home ownership is perhaps the shining example of this heartless model of economic progress. The first Bush term yielded to the second, and the unregulated market for homes and mortgages helped make possible the fiscal environment in which a great number of Americans were using real estate speculation as a way to create wealth that was otherwise lost to them in a flat stock market and in the galloping disappearance of the middle class. The banks, initially thriving on the loans and fees required for all this transacting, turned a blind eye to the kind of money being borrowed and often to the desperate people doing the borrowing. Which brings us to where we are today: mired in a precipitous slump in part inaugurated by the failure of booby-trapped mortgages that ought not to have been tendered, loans that ennobled neither borrower nor lender. In addition to facing energy and food prices that are climbing as steadily as their credit card bills, regular middle-class Americans are finding that they are now less likely to be members of the Ownership Society than of the Insolvent Society. </p> <p>The darker American fears meanwhile remain. The fear, the uncertainty, that end-of-empire anxiety. You can see the fear in the demonisation of undocumented workers in the United States. Fear of anything that will unsettle a rank-and-file white voter, the white voter who fears the United States of the future will no longer have a place for him. All of this fear pushes both sides of the electorate toward divisive political rhetoric, class hatred, racialist thinking, and so on. And it sure doesn't improve our diminished reputation abroad.</p> <p>Turns out, meanwhile, that Calvin Coolidge said a lot of other things in that speech from January 1925 - the one in which he said: 'After all, the chief business of the American people is business.' He also said: 'We make no concealment of the fact that we want wealth, but there are many other things that we want very much more. We want peace and honour, and that charity which is so strong an element of all civilisation. The chief ideal of the American people is idealism. I cannot repeat too often that America is a nation of idealists. That is the only motive to which they ever give any strong and lasting reaction.' The bulk of Coolidge's speech seems to have been effaced in these Years of Shareholder Value. These days, a speech remarking that there are 'many things we want more than wealth' might be construed as being anti-business. And in the United States, the anti-business political candidate is even harder to elect than the atheist. Still, maybe, just maybe, these ideals to which Coolidge alluded to are still throbbing in the American consciousness somewhere. Let's hope the years after the Years of Shareholder Value come quickly.</p> <h2>Siri Hustvedt</h2> <p><strong>Novelist, essayist and poet whose most recent novel, The Sorrows of an American, came out this year. Married to fellow writer Paul Auster.</strong></p> <p>Every political moment has a particular rhetorical climate. Language matters, not only because it articulates the dominant ideas of a period but because it shapes our perceptions of the world. For years, Americans have been listening to a president who has essentially cut the world in two. We are 'the protectors of freedom' fighting the 'evil-doers' who 'hate freedom'. Manipulating words for ideological purposes is hardly new. When it is effective, it creates an emotional response in the listener, a rush in the limbic system that can call on the deepest feelings we have as human beings. George W Bush and his administration chose to appeal to our fears.</p> <p>Playing on the age-old fear of malignant outsiders and foreigners, both those residing on American soil and elsewhere, the administration successfully created an atmosphere of absolutism after 11 September 2001. The exhortation 'If you're not with us, you're with the terrorists' is a form of political speech that makes dialogue impossible. There is no legitimate response because anyone who counters with another thought has already been lumped with an inhuman enemy. In psychiatric parlance, rigid polarities like those the President has made time and again are regarded as pathological: 'splitting'. The patient is unable to tolerate ambiguity and insists on viewing the people in his life through an 'all good' or 'all bad' lens. Bush and his cohorts have been masterful splitters, employing a language that gives no room for exchange and necessarily distorts reality, which, unfortunately, is usually murky. This kind of speech does not recognise an interlocutor, a real human other. It is speech without empathy, and it is startlingly similar to the rhetoric of the Muslim radicals who spew venom on the West and 'the enemies of Islam'.</p> <p>To be sure, there is something all too human about this phenomenon. The need for simple juxtapositions of good and evil, heroes and villains, is ubiquitous. It is the stuff of most Hollywood movies and many popular books. Nuance is discarded for easy clarity. It is possible that George W Bush actually views the world in these black and white terms, that his mind is as blunt and unrefined as his impromptu sentences. His now well-known emphasis on loyalty from those who work for him may be an indication of an 'all for' or 'all against' way of thinking. I don't know. I do know that the ironies are multiple. </p> <h2>Aleksandar Hemon</h2> <p><strong>Bosnian-Herzegovinian writer and journalist based in Chicago. His latest novel, The Lazarus Project, is a finalist for the 2008 National Book Award.</strong> </p> <p>I became an American citizen in November 2000, around the time of the infamous electoral impasse and the Supreme Court decision that gifted George W Bush his first presidency. I had ended up in the USA in 1992 because of the war in Bosnia. For eight years I was an alien resident - a contradiction in terms - before I decided to cross the big threshold and fully enter the home of the brave. Hence my first fledgling-American sentiment was full-fledged embarrassment at the democratic process that allowed the candidate for whom the minority of voters had cast their ballots to become the President of all. </p> <p>What made things worse was that W was/is the American stereotype come true - ignorant, incurious, congenitally uncomfortable with thought. Take this: in January 2000, at an Iowa community college, he succinctly laid out his future foreign policy, complete with its idiocy, in these immortal words: 'When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world, and you knew exactly who they were. It was us vs them, and it was clear who them was. Today we are not sure who the they are, but we know they're there.'</p> <p>But the quaint days of mere embarrassment ended abruptly on 11 September 2001, when the 'they' conveniently arrived in hijacked planes and tragically split American history into pre- and post-9/11 periods. I distinctly remember Bush addressing the discombobulated nation that day and saying: 'Freedom itself was attacked.' This at the time when television still showed footage of desperate New Yorkers leaping into certain, horrifying death off the Towers that would collapse in the next image. It seemed possible at that moment that tens of thousands had perished. </p> <p>It was impossible not to feel, deep in your body, the horror and the solidarity in response to the immense suffering. But all that our good President could come up with was a vacuous stock phrase. 'We're fucked,' I remember thinking. If he was capable of converting the terrible concreteness of human pain into a cheap abstraction, then American - let alone human - lives mean nothing to him.</p> <p>And fucked we were. Before long, the stock abstraction exploded into splendid and insufferable fireworks of banality celebrating the now-eternal struggle between the US and the freedom-hating they. Few Americans today wish to recall the time that led up to the invasion of Iraq and the Mission-Accomplished pageant, the time when Bush's approval rating was happily in the nineties; when Arab-looking citizens, including a number of Sikhs, were subject to vengeful assaults; when vulgar patriotism was enforced by ranting pundits and radio-talk-show hosts calling for nuking the towelheads; when French fries became freedom fries (and French kissing became freedom kissing.) This was the shameful time when editorial boards rushed to endorse the new-fangled Bush doctrine and the upcoming cakewalk in Iraq; when journalists at the White House press conferences dully followed the pre-approved script and war correspondents eagerly signed up to be embedded. This was when a vast majority of Americans, liberal and conservative, believed in the mirage of Saddam's WMD, which were - if I may say so as a novice at things American - blatantly and obviously non-existent. Few Americans care to recall those days because the only appropriate reaction to them is deep and humbling shame, and we are a proud people.</p> <p>George W Bush is the worst president in American history not only because everything he and his flunkeys touched instantly turned into long-lasting shit but because he brought out the worst in my fellow citizens and even some fellow foreigners (say, Tony Blair). He built a coalition of the willing participants in a criminal, immoral debacle that the Iraq adventure has been from start to not-in-sight finish. Any war criminal knows that if moral self-denial attains the shape of national pride, anything is possible, any crime can be explained away as either necessary or an honest mistake. Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, the destruction of Fallujah, torture as government policy, waterboarding as a common word, extraordinary renditions, the suspension of habeas corpus, unfettered eavesdropping, the diminishment of mechanisms of American democracy, the unaccountable government - not only did it all become acceptable to the majority of voters in the 2004 elections, it appeared as pride-inducing strength.</p> <p>I am no historian but it is my guess that the Bush regime would be in the running for the worst elected government in the history of Western civilisation. The score sheet is catastrophic: American foreign policy and international prestige are in tatters; the deficit and the national debt are reaching Zimbabwean proportions; states are impoverished and national infrastructure is falling apart; the practices of democracy have been so devalued that a militant bimbo is a viable vice-presidential candidate, while race-baiting is acceptable campaign practice. What to say of the destruction of New Orleans and the collapse of financial markets, neither of which the Bush court seemed particularly interested in until it was too late? Nothing Bush and his administration handled has remained undamaged, no stone misturned, all children left behind to forage through the debris in the aftermath of the past eight years.</p> <h2>Uzodinma Iweala</h2> <p><strong>Won John Llewellyn Rhys prize for Beasts of No Nation (2005). Chosen as one of Granta's Best Young American Novelists in 2007. He now attends Columbia University medical school.</strong></p> <p>George W Bush was elected President of the United States just after my 18th birthday on 7 November 2000. I remember clearly the atmosphere on Harvard's campus. It was a bit subdued because Harvard and its students tend to favour the left, but at the same time somewhat triumphant because whichever candidate, Bush or Gore, won, there would be a Harvard man in the White House. I also remember that I didn't vote. I couldn't vote because I was new to the political process and I didn't register to vote in time. And that ignorance is something that haunts me to this day.</p> <p>This was before 11 September 2001, when President Bush was caricatured as an idiot, but a thoroughly benign one who, if he didn't choke on another Pretzel, would at most spend four years under the direction of his tutor Vice President Cheney before America came to its senses and booted him out in favour of someone more worthy of the office, when his ideas of compassionate conservatism were wholly embraced by some and met with cautious acceptance by others, when as a nation we were still optimistic about our future and sure of our role as a shining example for the world. That has all changed.</p> <p>It sometimes seems that the last eight years have been a highly comical nightmare for the US and President Bush has been the comedic villain. This is the man who instructed us to shop our way out of a national tragedy, who plotted an illegal war based on the most nonsensical of lies that some of us chose to believe. This is the man who transformed torture into enhanced interrogation. This is the man who sat back unconcerned while one of his appointees mismanaged one of the biggest crises in American history - Hurricane Katrina - saying 'he's doing a heck of a job'. And now towards the end of his term, as he chest bumps graduating college seniors and tap dances before the start of press conferences, the war into which he has dragged young Americans rages and our economy slowly disintegrates. That has been the last eight years. For someone who doesn't get nearly enough sleep, I have never wanted to wake up so badly. </p> <p>But perhaps most troubling is what his presidency has done to America's opinion of itself. Where once we were a society that honoured excellence and achievement, the last eight years of President Bush have taught us to aspire to the lowest common denominator. As a country, we now feel that we shouldn't have to pay taxes and yet we still feel entitled to government services. As a country, we feel that we should take the easy road and drill for more oil instead of tightening our belts, parking our SUVs and investing money in alternative energy. As a country, we have allowed our news media to turn politics into a farce with personalities who rant and rave and journalists who trade integrity for access, reporting spoon-fed propaganda as actual news. As a country, we now collectively prefer presidents whom we could 'have a beer with' instead of leaders who will challenge us to rise above our petty insecurities and wants to risk something for our country. </p> <p>But it makes perfect sense. Why should we aspire to more when the decider in chief of the last eight years is a man who waltzed into the presidency on the legacy of his father (just as he waltzed into college, business and the governorship of Texas) and has refused to take responsibility for any of his failures? In my opinion, 'giving up golf', as he claimed, is not atonement enough for the American and Iraqi lives he has jeopardised. When our President has time and again refused to take the hard road towards excellence and deem torture illegal, and tell Americans we need to reduce our energy footprints, or truly invest in education for our young people, what are we supposed to do?</p> <p>The lowest moment of the last eight years for me happened at a school in Baltimore. I gave a talk to an auditorium full of high school students on the subject of war. We began speaking about the Iraq war and, of 500 students, 499 seemed to believe that Iraq had attacked us first and that we were totally justified in invading their country. Only one diminutive freshman in that school of mostly large athletic boys stood up and said: 'Guys. What we're doing over there is not right.' It hurt me to think that after eight years of President Bush, this is the future of America - group-think based on falsities and jingoist myths with dissent offered by only a very few.</p> <p>This has been my political coming of age, watching our President preside over a gaggle of squabbling politicians too fearful to do their jobs and drive the country towards excellence, and a population too beholden to the pursuit of personal gain and the politics of fear to demand more of them. </p> <p>It's only in George W Bush's America that 'community organiser' can be used as a slander and the words 'hope' and 'change' can be ridiculed as meaningless and empty. </p> <p>This is not the same country that I lived in as a teenager, when Teach for America was as important as military service and the word American was golden in the ears of our fellow global citizens. Like I said, I want to wake up. Many of us do, and for the first time in Barack Obama we have found a candidate who seems ready to ring the alarm clock, no matter how annoyed we get as a nation. I'm not an Obamaniac, as people derisively call his supporters, but I recognise that, for the first time in my political life, someone has stood up and said: 'America, it's time to make some hard choices.' </p> <p>In two months, this eight-year journey under the guidance of President Bush through the valleys of mediocrity will either come to an end with Barack Obama or continue for another four, perhaps even eight years with John McCain. </p> <p>On 7 November 2000 I could claim I was naive. On 4 November 2008, there can be no excuses.</p> <h2>Andover to Afghanistan: The life of George W Bush</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> </p> <p><strong>6 July 1946</strong> In New Haven, Connecticut, the oldest child of Barbara Bush and George HW Bush, US President from 1989 to 1993.

  "<p><strong>Antony and the Johnsons/ LSO</strong><br>Barbican, London EC2</p> <p>Antony Hegarty isn't what you'd call the complete performer, I think it's fair to say, though he is in fine voice - and what a voice, crystalline and plaintive, filling the sedate Barbican Hall tonight. But no, he could be in his own bedsit - the light off, singing in the dark. Yes, the dark! He is performing - you can just about see the odd flailing arm - but he's lost in himself, as though he's just got back from an unsuccessful night out and is consoling himself with a couple of weepy ballads before bed. The audience, after giving him a rapturous welcome, is reverent and watchful. No one thinks it odd that Antony is singing in the dark. He is the one. Behind him, the London Symphony Orchestra (and a small handful of Johnsons) labour studiously in their own little pools of light. Antony, large and ungainly (but hardly the Elephant Man - let's see him for goodness sake!), is wearing something long and diaphanous over his day clothes. Are those tracksuit bottoms? 'I got kissed by a turtle dove ... ' he sings, his hands enacting some private torment. Your heart goes out to him.</p> <p>We're three songs in before a chink of grey dawn appears. He stands merely shadowed now, black hair parted, his skin pallid, his expression effortful as he glides into 'Cripple and the Starfish', a majestic and poignant anthem about the unhelpful blindness of love in an abusive relationship. It's about having your fingers cut off and them growing again, like a starfish. It's about coming back for more. The strings are a little busier, the woodwind twiddling with menace. It's quite beautiful.</p> <p>The crowd, having sat through two unfamiliar works (this concert is one of a handful of autumn dates in which the band are previewing their third studio album, The Crying Light, due next January), responds with the sort of wildness you reserve for having something to be wild about. Antony, more at home now - or perhaps still at home, but in the glow of an open fridge - sings a flawless 'For Today I Am a Boy' from his flawless I Am a Bird Now album, his hands stroking the air. </p> <p>Apart from a murmured 'thank you' he is silent between songs, which ebb and flow with their own mini-dramas. Visually, you might want for more. Antony - alabaster in the half-light, like a statue of one of the bulkier Greek goddesses - is full of grace, but I'm afraid not in a physical way. My eyes roam the stage for novelty: the bass players banging their instruments during a rare tribal passage; the conductor shutting someone up with a sudden gesture. I did wonder how much of Hegarty's austere, visceral quality would survive the might of the London Symphony Orchestra tonight - or rather the arrangements of New York boy-wonder composer Nico Muhly, whose esoteric atonal 'soundscapes' (he has a day job working for Philip Glass) have been skittering round my iPod this week. 'He paints the sky with his work,' Hegarty has said, though I was still dimly expecting tapes of running bath water or someone frying eggs in a strong wind. There is the odd drone (at one point effectively reducing the three chords of a lovely new song, 'Another World', to one) but the orchestra is restrained joy itself. 'I fell in love with a dead boy,' Antony sings, with understandable concern, his arms reaching for the clouds, dry ice drifting like mist over a wet lawn.</p> <p>For most of us, Antony Hegarty swooped out of nowhere when he won the Mercury Prize in 2005 for the Bird album - descending from heaven itself, it seemed, judging by the terms in which his startling, tremulous vocal style (lauded to the skies as 'ethereal', 'sublime', 'transcendent') came to be described. Was this the 'Gay Messiah' as prophesied by Rufus Wainwright, 'reborn from 1970s porn'? He didn't quite fit the bill. He's not Freddie Mercury, or indeed Rufus, who cheerfully ends his own shows looking like he's stepped out of an Ann Summers window display.</p> <p>He is compelling, though: an androgynous, goth-haired, gentle man-boy giant who arrived with a starry siblinghood of disciples - Wainwright himself, Lou Reed ('When I first heard Antony I knew I was in the presence of an angel'), Bj\u00f6rk, Boy George, arty pranksters Devendra Banhart and Yoko Ono all smitten collaborators. His sexual mystery and stoic aura of suffering, his New York drag-punk apprenticeship (though he was born in Chichester, West Sussex), his homage to fallen Warholian sirens Divine and Candy Darling, seemed calculated to excite an adoring gay following. But the Church of Antony is broader than that. His intimate, radiant songs may be autobiographical, with their cross-gender issues and talk of guilt or pain or hopes of growing up to be a beautiful woman ('I feel the power in me'), but they also speak more generally of struggle, suggest less specific sorts of hope. They have the core self-belief of devotional music - psalm-like sometimes, but more often gospelly and soulful, capturing the spirit of Nina Simone (Antony's big heroine), her jazzy vocal dips, her dignity; even, somehow, her moral authority. If Hegarty is not the light, he seems at least to have seen it. </p> <p>For his encore he finds his tongue and an endearing sense of humour to tell us the rambling story of a New York transvestite prostitute who used to throw tins of catfood at passing cars, but who drowned in the Hudson River. Antony named his band for her (she was called Marsha P Johnson) and wrote her a song, which he now sings. 'River of sorrow, don't swallow this time ... ' Now that is sublime.</p> <p>\u2022 Kitty Empire is away</p>",
  "<p>Budapest has been transformed over the past decade from a down-at-heel haven of post-Communist nostalgia to a lively and prosperous metropolis on the Danube, with smart restaurants and stylish urban apartments.</p> <p>Yet Hungary last week became the latest country forced to take a $25bn rescue package from international donors, as it was driven to the brink of bankruptcy by the credit crunch.</p> <p>Little more than a year ago, City investment banks were holding glitzy seminars extolling the virtues of emerging Europe as a one-way bet on the benefits of catch-up capitalism, and cash was flooding into the region. Now, the former darlings of the international markets are lining up for handouts.</p> <p>Hungary's rescue has been the largest, but it is not alone. Iceland has already received help; Ukraine and Belarus are in negotiations with the IMF; and, in another extraordinary move, the US Federal Reserve last week offered to provide dollars in exchange for local currency to cash-strapped central banks in South Korea, Mexico, Brazil and Singapore.</p> <p>The speed at which these various financial lifeboats have been launched reveals a deep international fear: that the jarring shock suffered by investors around the world will force them to bail out of all but the safest markets, draining credit from vulnerable countries.</p> <p>That could even mean the aftershocks of the financial crisis are felt as far away as Africa - and as the IMF rides to the rescue in central Europe, anti-poverty campaigners are becoming increasingly alarmed that the fate of the world's poor will be forgotten in the maelstrom.</p> <p>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the former Nigerian finance minister who is now managing director of the World Bank, warns that the progress many African countries have made over the past decade could be at risk. 'We are worried that the financial crisis will compound other crises: food, fuel, fertiliser. These are hitting poor countries, and hitting Africa particularly hard,' she says. 'It could come into the African continent through various channels: through a squeeze on credit and liquidity - some countries were about to come to the markets to raise money for infrastructure projects.</p> <p>'The other route is exports: with recession in the US and Europe, we expect that demand will fall off for exports, and that will really have an impact.'</p> <p>Even as the credit crunch continues to ravage overstretched banks, she urges governments in the West to exhort their domestic investors to hold their nerve, and continue looking for risky but profitable opportunities overseas. 'One message is, encourage your private sector to make investments that sustain for the long term: you need to encourage them to stay the course,' she says.</p> <p>For the time being, though, the focus is on eastern Europe - and the size of the bailout to Hungary has put the IMF firmly back in business. After several years of rare calm in the world economy, it has found its role once again.</p> <p>Controversy is already raging about the conditions countries have been forced to meet to unlock IMF cash. The fund faced fierce criticism after the Asian financial crisis of the late Nineties for imposing political straitjackets on the countries it helped.</p> <p>Iceland has had to shove its interest rates up to 18 per cent, having cut them as recently as a fortnight ago. That should help to underpin its currency, the krona, whose plunge has made the country's vast foreign debts harder to afford. But, in the short term, it will exacerbate borrowers' difficulties.</p> <p>In Belarus, meanwhile, the government is reportedly under pressure to privatise its banking sector: precisely the opposite course of action taken by the US and Britain, where billions of dollars of public cash have been spent nationalising all or part of many battered banks.</p> <p>In Hungary, drastic budget cuts are part of the IMF package. Romania is rumoured to have turned down IMF help because the government was unwilling to sign up to sharp reductions in public spending.</p> <p>However, Barbara Nestor, eastern European economist at Commerzbank, says Bucharest is unlikely to be able to hold out for long, because if Romania is the only country in the region without an aid package, it will be singled out by investors. 'Market pressure could eventually lead it to co-operate,' she says.</p> <p>Neil Shearing, central Europe economist at consultancy Capital Economics, predicts that the spending reductions demanded by the IMF will bring about a painful downturn.</p> <p>'We now expect most of the region to enter recession this year,' he says. 'We expect further IMF packages, and they come with strings attached: they only lend to you if they think they're going to get the money back, and that means cutting government spending by as much as 1 per cent of GDP.'</p> <p>So while the US and Britain are slashing interest rates, and allowing public spending to rise to prevent the recession from becoming too severe, emerging economies will be urged to push up borrowing costs and cut back on government budgets, to demonstrate to the world's financial markets that they have learnt the error of their ways.</p> <p>Laszlo Andor, Hungarian director of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, says ironically, the downturn now in store could help Budapest to meet the strict targets for joining the European single currency. 'It might be a step back, but it might be a push forward: we could end up with a low deficit, low inflation and low interest rates. It's what nobody would have wanted - we could meet the Maastricht criteria, but only by going through a depression.'</p> <p>Shearing says that for many of these countries, a reckoning was inevitable. As cheap money has coursed through the veins of the world financial system, the burgeoning middle classes of central Europe have been on a wild spending spree. House prices and stock markets have boomed, and firms and consumers have piled up dangerous levels of debt, often in foreign currencies.</p> <p>'Several countries in the region have been borrowing very heavily in Swiss francs or euros to finance consumption,' Shearing says. </p> <p>Hungary's foreign debts are dwarfed by those of several neighbours, in particular the Baltic states.</p> <p>Olexi Pasyuk, the Ukrainian representative of Bankwatch, the network of civil society groups that monitor the Bretton Woods institutions, says the public are so anxious to receive emergency help that there is little scrutiny of any conditions that might be attached.</p> <p>'There is a certain level of panic,' he says. 'Investors are taking money out, and we urgently need foreign currency. The government is prepared to agree to anything the IMF proposes.'</p> <p>Hungarians who have dealt with the IMF for decades say they detect at least some softening in its stance; but as much of eastern Europe is plunged into deep recession by the after-effects of the credit crunch, public resentment at the influence of the Bretton Woods institutions could grow to be just as powerful and long-lasting as in the crisis-riven Asian economies of the late-1990s.</p>",
  "<p>Passengers who used their Visa debit cards to pay for flights with the failed airline Sterling could lose hundreds of pounds because they are unaware that they can claim a refund. </p> <p>The Danish airline, which operated low-frills flights within Scandinavia, and between Scandinavia and a range of European destinations, went into administration on Wednesday. It issued a statement warning passengers who had booked through its website that they would not get a refund. Passengers who had booked by credit card, or through a tour operator or agency, were told they could claim their money back, but would have to contact their credit card provider or the travel agent to do so. </p> <p>Yet hundreds of passengers of bust airlines Zoom and XL who bought their tickets using a Visa debit card have successfully claimed refunds using a system which many others are still not aware of.</p> <p>Zoom went into administration on 29 August, leaving about 1,000 UK passengers stuck abroad, while holiday firm XL Leisure group went bust on 12 September, leaving 85,000 people stranded. Ten thousand of these XL customers, who booked direct flights with the airline or through its website XL.com, were not covered by Atol, the scheme that protects package holiday bookings.</p> <p>But many customers who paid for their holidays with a debit card have since successfully claimed money back using a little-known facility called Visa Chargeback. To make a claim using chargeback, customers must contact their card issuer, which then contacts the holiday company's payment processing bank to reclaim the money. This means that even if a company goes into liquidation it is possible to reclaim money, as the claim is made against the company's bank, not the company itself. The claim can be made on any purchase where the goods or services are not provided - and is not reliant on the supplier going bust: the Co-op cites a case of refunding a customer for some V festival tickets that never materialised, although the supplier was still in operation.</p> <p>If the supplier goes into liquidation, however, customers need to apply for a chargeback refund within 120 days. So passengers caught out when Zoom went bust now have 55 days left to claim, and those who bought with XL have 69 days left. Once a claim is made, the time taken to get money returned should be relatively short - days or weeks, rather than months - but a spokesman for Visa says customers who haven't already claimed but are eligible to do so should 'get on the case' as soon as possible. </p> <p>The Co-operative bank says it has already processed and refunded 470 credit and debit card purchases with XL and Zoom - 132 of which were debit cards. The overall amount the Co-op has refunded was \u00a3214,886 - an average of \u00a3457 per customer - while the average time from receipt of request to refund was six days.</p> <p>All other major banking groups in the UK use Visa debit cards except HSBC, including First Direct, and The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, including NatWest: these use Maestro for their debit cards. Under UK Maestro rules, a UK cardholder does not have chargeback rights except when goods are bought online through an overseas website. This puts the 10 million HSBC and First Direct and 10.5 million RBS and NatWest banking customers at a disadvantage. </p> <p>'Banks factor this extra protection in when they choose which type of card they want to issue,' says a Visa spokesperson. 'Visa is a better proposition for their customers, especially in the current economic climate.'</p> <p>First Direct and HSBC will gradually switch all their customers to Visa debit cards, starting in January. The change-over will happen over 16 months, so customers whose cards expire during that time will have them replaced with Visa debit cards automatically, while others will be contacted in phases. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group will also issue Visa debit cards to its customers, but not until the second half of next year.</p> <p>Many cardholders prefer to book by debit card rather than credit card in order to reduce their exposure to debt. However, Brad King, chief executive of money comparison website Compareandsave.com, says: 'If consumers are sensible and it was a purchase they were already planning to make they will already have the money budgeted for it. This means that they can pay the credit card bill off straight away after the purchase, meaning they won't accrue any interest charges, and won't be left with debt.'</p> <p>In the event of a company going bankrupt, there is another advantage to paying by credit card: section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act allows cardholders to make a claim against their card issuer if the company they have bought from goes bust. Crucially, they can also claim for all losses caused by the 'breach of contract or misrepresentation'; in other words in the case of a defunct airline, the cost of any replacement flights. This applies even if all that was paid by credit card was the deposit.</p> <p>XL customer Pascal Don discovered this after he had put in a claim to his card company for his lost flights back from Canada. Don originally paid \u00a31,100 for XL flights for himself, his wife and their two children back from Halifax. 'We found out XL had collapsed when we were at the airport waiting for our flight home and we had to pay for alternative flights with Icelandair at the cost of \u00a34,000,' he says. </p> <p>Don had paid for the XL flights on his John Lewis credit card so he put in a claim for those flights when he returned and, following advice from The Observer, also put in a claim for the replacement flights. John Lewis has now agreed to refund him \u00a35,100. </p> <p>Not all card issuers will be as accommodating as John Lewis. The Financial Ombudsman says that what exactly has to be met by the credit card issuer is 'a bit of a grey area' as it depends on what the card provider thinks constitutes 'reasonable costs'. Any cardholders who have trouble claiming additional expenses from their card issuer should contact the ombudsman on 0845 080 1800.</p> <h2>Fare success</h2> <p>Sarah Mampilly, who works in human resources in Bristol, had planned to be on holiday in Egypt this month. She bought flights to Sharm el-Sheikh for herself and a friend direct from the XL website for \u00a3640 earlier this year on her debit card. She was in Morocco in September on holiday when she found out the airline had gone under. </p> <p>'I booked direct on the website with my debit card, which I thought when I found out the news was the worst way to do it,' she says. 'I hadn't even considered that my travel insurance wouldn't cover my flights if my airline went under.'</p> <p>It was only when a colleague told her that it was possible to claim back money for payments by Visa debit that Sarah contacted her bank, The Co-operative. 'The woman on the phone said I could get my money back and compared the scenario to that of Farepak [the Christmas hamper company that went bust] whose customers also got money back this way,' she says. </p> <p>Sarah also got the five days' leave that she had booked off for Egypt back from her company.</p> <p>'I still won't pay by credit card when booking as I am not prepared to pay the 5 per cent charge. At least I know I am now covered by my debit card,' she says.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:l.bachelor@observer.co.uk\">l.bachelor@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<h2>The brief</h2> <p><strong>Fleur Grenier and Roy Newnham live in Littlehampton, West Sussex. </strong></p> <p><strong>'We're getting married in early February and are keen for a week in the sun. Our budget is about \u00a31,000 (excluding spending money) but we don't want to go for Cyprus and the Canaries - because Roy has worked there and wants to go somewhere new. I'd love to get to somewhere like the Caribbean, but could we afford it? I'm a pewtersmith and make the majority of my income at Christmas fairs. Will we get a cheaper deal if we wait till the New Year?'</strong></p> <p>There are ways to make honeymoons cheaper. 'Stick close to home,' says Jill Nash, author of Honeymoons in Style. 'Pick a destination that has a low-cost airline or that you can reach by train and search out accommodation on the internet. Cheaper travel will mean that you can spend more on a nice hotel.' Try to avoid travelling in half term (from 6-18 February) and if you can leave a few days between the wedding and the honeymoon finding a bargain will be easier - flights leaving mid-week tend to be cheaper than those at the weekend. Some people dislike all-inclusive resorts on principle, since they tend to deprive local bars and restaurants of tourist trade, but they can help make a destination more affordable. Charter flights can bring countries such as India within reach.</p> <p>Now to the question of winter sun. In February, Tunisia and Morocco should have daytime temperatures of around 20C. The evenings will still be cold but while you might encounter a little rain, you should see plenty of sun. The Red Sea offers scuba diving and snorkelling and, if you stay around Hurghada, Luxor and the Valley of the Kings is a day-trip away. Daytime temperatures should be a couple of degrees higher than Marrakesh though nights can still be cool. </p> <p>For serious winter sun you need to head further afield to India and Mexico. Sarah Anderson, of Thomas Cook, says: 'Kerala is a wonderful destination with temperatures of around 29C in February. It offers great value for money and is a good alternative to Goa. Seven nights' B&amp;B, including flights, at the three-star Uday Samudra Hotel in Kovalam is on special offer at \u00a3498 per person, down from \u00a3649. Because a honeymoon is a fixed date we recommend booking as early as possible.' </p> <p>To book now, or not? Your decision about this depends on how important the honeymoon is to you. These days, most couples will have holidayed together before the wedding. A honeymoon has more symbolism than the average holiday, but - arguably - not much more. If you like the look of a particular hotel and you find a good deal, book now - there's no guarantee that the same holiday will be available after the New Year. If it's the destination that appeals and it has plenty of hotels and flights from different carriers, then you might want to gamble by waiting, although Paul Nelson of <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">lastminute.com</a> advises that its best to secure flights, but leave booking the hotel until later. 'If you leave it till the last minute,' he says, 'flights are often more difficult to find than accommodation.' </p> <p>Certain destinations tend to become more expensive the later you try to book them. The Caribbean is one of these. From 17 December, a new charter airline from Monarch will launch flights to Tobago and Grenada which may result in some good deals in the New Year. Currently flights in February are \u00a3466. One last thing, it's always worth telling the travel agent, tour operator or hotel that it's your honeymoon. Most hotels try to make honeymooners happy with fruit, sparkling wine - and room upgrades.</p> <h2>The insiders' tips</h2> <p><strong>Matthew Fisher, Real Holidays</strong></p> <p>The twelve-hour flight time means I wouldn't normally suggest Goa for a week, but if they can cope with the journey it's an ideal choice - great beaches, bustling markets, really relaxing. I suggest the quiet beaches of the south, where you can walk for miles without seeing anybody. Jewel in the Crown is offering a week at the traditional Failaka Guesthouse from \u00a3570, including flights, transfers and B&amp;B accommodation in February, but if they risk booking late, or are prepared to fly from Manchester, they may get this under the \u00a3500 per person guideline. </p> <p>They could also consider Gambia, a six-hour flight from the UK, with friendly people, sandy beaches and exotic culture. Late deals from The Gambia Experience include a week's B&amp;B at the Kombo Beach hotel from \u00a3469 including flights and transfers.</p> <p>A final suggestion would be Egypt. In February it should be positively balmy, but I would advise shunning the traditional Sharm package to head for the luxurious Movenpick El Quseir resort south of Hurghada. Set in a beautiful bay with its own beach, and just a short walk from the town itself, packages to this hotel are usually over \u00a3600 in February but with a bit of creative thinking we should be able to get this within budget. At the moment the hotel is offering complimentary transfers and with a standard room starting at \u00a3475 per week, B&amp;B, there is enough left over to book an Easyjet flight to Hurghada. They would have to move fast, as the later they leave it the more expensive flights will be but, by being further south, they get warmer temperatures, fewer tourists and a visit to Luxor is achievable in a day.</p> <p>\u2022 Real Holidays 020 7359 3938; <a href=\"http://www.realholidays.co.uk\">realholidays.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Amanda Statham, travel editor, You &amp; Your Wedding magazine</strong></p> <p>I wouldn't recommend holding out for a New-Year bargain. While you may be lucky and pay two-star prices for a five-star getaway, you risk ending up with a mediocre package or, worse still, not able to book anywhere. Luckily, there are some fantastic deals around at the moment, which won't break the bank. </p> <p>The Caribbean is very pricey in February as it is peak time. However the Mexican Riviera (which shares the same sea as the Caribbean islands and also has fabulous golden beaches) is a more realistic option. First Choice (<a href=\"http://www.firstchoice.co.uk/mexico\">firstchoice.co.uk/mexico</a>) is offering seven nights at the small and friendly Caribbean Princess resort early next year from \u00a3589 per person, including flights. It's all-inclusive, so although it's \u00a3178 over budget, your extra expenditure on food and drink will be zero as you'll have paid it all up front. There's loads to do, from scuba diving to visiting local craft markets. </p> <p>Closer to home, I'd recommend Morocco as a fantastic destination. It's exotic, has a great year-round climate and accommodation is seriously romantic. Kick off in Marrakesh, where you'll appreciate the souks full of intricate jewellery and beautiful ironworks. The riads (converted townhouses built around an inner courtyard) are knockout and a real bargain. Check out Riad Jonan (<a href=\"http://www.riadjonan.com\">riadjonan.com</a>) from \u00a355 per room, per night, furnished with hand-carved furniture and tiles, tucked away in the atmospheric Medina. After a few days exploring, head to Essaouira, where you can lie by the pool at hotels such as Atlas Essaouira (<a href=\"http://www.hipmorocco.com\">hipmorocco.com</a>) from \u00a370 per room, per night. No need to worry about flights pushing you over budget; Easyjet (<a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">easyjet.com</a>) flies to Marrakesh.</p>",
  "<p>Lebanon, summer 1982. One of the most controversial wars in Israel's short history is in full flow. In an area of west Beirut under Israeli army control, thousands of Palestinian refugees are slaughtered by Lebanese Christian Phalangist militiamen. Twenty years will pass before director Ari Folman, a young Israeli soldier at the time, begins a journey into his repressed past and returns to the days of the notorious Sabra and Shatila massacre. It will take him four more years of intensive film-making with a talented team of illustrators and animators before he delivers the result: the animated documentary Waltz with Bashir, Israel's most praised film in recent years.</p> <p>The film, which won six Israeli Film Academy awards and is Israel's official entry for best foreign film in next year's Oscars, has been at the centre of a cacophony of reviews, talkbacks and personal exchange since its domestic release last June. In one of the recurring scenes, naked figures emerge from the sea at Beirut, rifles hanging across their bony torsos. They seem cut off from the atrocities taking place nearby. Shades of black and orange dominate the background and eerie music plays. There is no dialogue, only haunting images of tormented men reaching a tormented place.</p> <p>This silence has been mirrored by audiences in Israeli cinemas. It lingers until long after the end credits have rolled; and it settled on my colleagues and me as we left a London preview screening, struggling to gather our thoughts and feelings into words.</p> <p>My older brother was a soldier in Lebanon in 1982. I was 12 years old and I remember only fragmentary details: my mother keeping herself frantically busy (her way, she would later say, of coping with 'maternal worries'); the cherries my brother brought from Lebanon when he came back on leave; the names of 'fallen' soldiers on the TV screen each evening before the news; and the 400,000-strong demonstration in Tel Aviv after the atrocities in Sabra and Shatila were exposed.</p> <p>My cousin was killed while on reserve duty in Tyre; all I remember was the car that brought the news and took my father to his bereaved sister.</p> <p>For years, Ariel Sharon, Israel's defence minister at the time of the 1982 invasion, was the ultimate villain in our household, but we never really talked about my brother's experience in Lebanon. In 2001, the national psyche exercised its formidable forgetfulness once again as the majority of Israelis voted Sharon Prime Minister.</p> <p>'I know so little about these events,' said one of my companions at the screening. 'I tried to remember where I was when this war took place, but I can't.'</p> <p>Regardless of where we were at the time, Waltz with Bashir makes us all reflect on this past from where we are now - still entrenched in a bloody Middle East. It also invites us to contemplate how Israel's past has been represented in film.</p> <p>Even before the establishment of Israel in 1948, and until the early Sixties, films did engage with Israel's military struggle to establish its own state and survival, but usually in the context of a hostile and indistinguishable Arab mass, one labelled as the ultimate enemy. Israeli fighters were depicted as heroes. The few feature films made in Israel up to the Sixties, such as Hill 24 Doesn't Answer, the iconic 1955 film about the 1948 war by British director Thorold Dickinson, were clearly part of the collective effort to justify the Zionist cause and foster a strong national identity.</p> <p>The focus on the external threat and the battle for survival shifted during the Sixties. Israeli cinema turned its lenses to internal matters, notably the massive migration and the cultural diversity of the newly formed society.</p> <p>It wasn't until the Eighties that Israeli cinema acknowledged a Palestinian people and individual Palestinians - a development termed 'the return of the repressed' by leading film scholar Ella Shohat. While the first Lebanon war raged in 1982, creating ever larger rifts within Israeli-Jewish society, Israeli films brought Palestinian stories onto the screen for the first time. </p> <p>Daniel Waxman's Hamsin (1982) and On a Narrow Bridge by Nissim Dayan (1985) both engage with love stories between mixed couples, while Uri Barbash's Beyond the Walls, which received an Oscar nomination in 1984, used the prison drama genre to dramatise a powerful alliance between Jewish and Palestinian prisoners as they fight together against the establishment. </p> <p>The 'Palestinian Wave' of the Eighties, however significant culturally, had limited popular appeal. Israeli cinema entered the Nineties with some critical zeal but it was more concerned with domestic issues than with confronting the national conflict head on. However, the groundwork for the flourishing Israeli cinema of today was laid during the Nineties, thanks to the establishment of film schools and film funds, shifts in local broadcasting, which created many more opportunities for local film-makers (before 1993, Israel had only one TV channel), and finally the New Cinema Law of 2000, which allocated significant public funding to the film industry.</p> <p>But what are the politics of this recent prosperity? Or rather, where are its politics?</p> <p>Some of the most recent successes have had little to do with the conflict. Late Marriage, the new wave's first box-office hit, from 2001, deals with the tensions between tradition and modernity within a close-knit Georgian-Israeli community.</p> <p>Nir Bergman's drama Broken Wings exposes a family's domestic difficulties after the sudden death of the father as the result of a bee sting. Avi Nesher's Turn Left at the End of the World, set among two migrant families in a development town in the late Sixties, harks back to the romantic Zionist idea of the Israeli 'melting pot'. These dramas were confined to the 'safe territories' of Israeli-Jewish society, limited mainly to urban landscapes and appealing to universal sentiments of family, romance and cultural differences.</p> <p>Some critics welcomed these trends as a sign that Israeli film-makers were finally thinking beyond the burden of national political concerns. However, this was not an option for the Palestinian-Israeli film-makers, who were also making their mark in the late Nineties and after.</p> <p>In films such as Chronicle of a Disappearance and Divine Intervention, both by Elia Suleiman, and Hany Abu-Assad's Oscar-nominated Paradise Now, the land of Israel/Palestine is marked by borders and boundaries that profoundly shape its inhabitants, who can only dwell on the multiple layers of the national conflict.</p> <p>Similar ground has been covered in documentaries by Israeli-Jewish film-makers. An early example is Amos Gitai's The House, from 1980, which touched on one of the great taboos - the effects of the 1948 war of independence on the Palestinians. It traced the history of a house in west Jerusalem, owned until 1948 by a Palestinian family. In recent years, the number of documentaries reflecting critically on the conflict has swelled: they include The Inner Tour (Ra'anan Alexandrowicz, 2001); Wall (Simone Bitton, 2004); and Avenge But One of My Two Eyes (Avi Mograbi, 2005).</p> <p>It is almost solely in documentaries that one can see Palestinian people and be exposed to their experiences and points of view. The individual figure of the Palestinian, with a name and a face, disappeared from Israeli feature films after the first Palestinian uprising in the late Eighties and has only rarely re-emerged in Israeli dramas since.</p> <p>Signs of a change are emerging, however. A number of recent popular Israeli films, including Close to Home, the Oscar-nominated Beaufort, Lemon Tree and Waltz with Bashir, deal with the national conflict as it plays into the lives of individuals in the region. (All of these films have been, or are soon to be, on general release in the UK.)</p> <p>Of these, only Lemon Tree portrays a Palestinian experience and narrative. Co-written by Eran Riklis and the Palestinian-Israeli Suha Arraf, it tells the story of a Palestinian widow whose lemon grove is about to be uprooted by the Israeli army, due to its proximity to the newly built home of Israel's defence minister. The film establishes a powerful relationship between the widow and the minister's wife. The film, which continues to gain awards and large audiences across the world, had only limited commercial success in Israel.</p> <p>Joseph Cedar's Beaufort tells the story of Israeli soldiers in the last weeks before the Israeli retreat from Lebanon in 2000, but its romantic portrayal of young male soldiers, typical of more traditional war films, undermines the film's stated anti-war declarations. Waltz with Bashir, on the other hand, never falls into the cliche of male comradeship in times of war, even though the story is told from an Israeli point of view.</p> <p>'War films miss the mark of being anti-war,' director Ari Folman has said. 'When you watch films like that at the age of 15, you tell yourself that war is terrible but the soldiers are cool, heroic. I absolutely did not want kids to wish they were like the characters in the movie, including me... There is none of the Israeli glitter of war, no hyping of the fighters. Everyone is a classic anti-hero.'</p> <p>In the film, war and its aftermath are shown as the loneliest of experiences, devoid of shared memories or references. This alienation resonates in the innovative use of animation to recall, convey and construct true events from the past. The 'animated documentary' hybrid builds a critical distance between the audience and the events on the screen yet, paradoxically, this makes them more accessible: we can get up close to the evils of war and still reflect on them.</p> <p>Waltz... is a film about difficult and often traumatic repressed memories that haunt men decades after the events. It is also about individuals who live within a society that cultivates certain memories while relegating others to oblivion, hardly ever stopping to question the price.</p> <p>It has certainly touched a nerve in Israel. One hundred thousand people have seen the film since its release in June and it has received huge media attention. Some critics have assigned it to the genre of 'shooting and crying': films that focus on the suffering of Israeli soldiers while shying away from the Palestinian victims of the conflict, not ready to take responsibility for their role in creating and maintaining the tragic circumstances they lament. Others celebrated the unique treatment of significant historical events, praising how Waltz... made it possible to recall a difficult past. </p> <p>The act of remembering and reflecting on military experiences is present in other recent Israeli films about the bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Tamar Yarom's award-winning documentary To See If I'm Smiling narrates the testimonies of six Israeli women soldiers who served in the occupied territories. Avi Mograbi's 'musical documentary', Z32, which premiered this year at Cannes, is dedicated to the confession of an Israeli soldier who killed two innocent Palestinian policemen to avenge the death of Israeli soldiers.</p> <p>At the end of Folman's journey into his past, he is finally able to integrate his memories into his own biography. They have a shape, a place and even a sound. This is clearly a brave achievement. The question is: what he will do with these memories now that they have reached the surface?</p> <p>This same question must be asked of the Israeli public, who have clearly been touched by this animated journey. Will these exposed memories shed further light on the mechanism that so powerfully creates our shared history and collective identity? Will they change the way Israelis reflect on their past?</p> <p>In an emotional speech at the Israeli Academy Awards ceremony, Folman dedicated Waltz with Bashir to the children born to the film crew during the years of filming. He said: 'I hope that when they grow up, in 15 years' time, they will see this film on the big screen and it will have nothing to do with their lives.'</p> <p>Reflecting on my childhood memories through the imagery of Folman's remarkable film, I find myself wishing not for a pain-free, 'context-liberated' animation, but rather for one that can still hold a mirror to our own reflections 15 years from now. Whether these reflections will empower us to act and help us assume responsibility for our state of being remains to be seen.</p> <p>\u2022 Waltz with Bashir, Lemon Tree and To See If I'm Smiling will screen at the UK Jewish Film Festival, 8-20 November, in London cinemas, <a href=\"http://www.ukjewishfilmfestival.org.uk\">ukjewishfilmfestival.org.uk</a>. Waltz with Bashir is released on November 21, Lemon Tree on December 12</p> <h2>Israel on screen: The milestones</h2> <p><strong>Exodus (1960)</strong> Based on Leon Uris's sweeping novel, Otto Preminger's epic saga (featuring Sal Mineo) is about the founding of Israel in the days after the Second World War. Paul Newman starred as Ari Ben Canaan, the commander of the Exodus ship bringing 600 European Jews from British-blockaded Cyprus into the newly partitioned Palestine.</p> <p><strong>Sallah Shabati (1964)</strong> Brought Chaim Topol to world notice and became Israel's first big national cinema hit. It received an Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe. It concerned a large Jewish family from an Arab country arriving during the wave of immigration to Israel in the Fifties and the native Israelis' snobbish resistance to the newcomers. </p> <p><strong>Bourekas films</strong> Named after a light pastry delicacy, the Bourekas films of the Seventies are the most popular movies made in Israel. Although critically derided, these farcical, Carry On-like comedies and over-acted melodramas had low production values and usually depicted tensions between Mizrahi or Sephardi Jews and Ashkenazi Jews, the former being canny but poor, the latter conceited and arrogant. Boaz Davidson was the most successful director, gaining international fame in 1978 when his crude teen hit Lemon Popsicle was successfully dubbed into English and distributed on the nascent VHS market.</p> <p><strong>Raid on Entebbe (1977)</strong> An all-star cast included Charles Bronson, Jack Warden and Robert Loggia and featured Peter Finch's final role, playing future Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The action centred on the Israeli army's 500-strong commando response to the hijack of an Air France plane given permission to land at Entebbe airport in Uganda. An Israeli Top Gun, the film was used as a recruitment drive and, despite accusations of propagandism, it did much to encourage a new world-view of Israel as the little country with which you shouldn't mess.</p> <p><strong>Kadosh (1998) and Kippur (2000)</strong> Director Amos Gitai established himself at the forefront of Israel's new cinema when these films became international arthouse successes after appearing in the Official Selection at the Cannes Film Festival, paving the way for Israeli film's current renaissance. Kadosh was one of the first films to criticise Israel's orthodox religious community of Mea Shearim, while Kippur was one of the first renderings of the 1973 Yom Kippur war, set in the Golan Heights and featuring a helicopter crash similar to one suffered by the director.<br><strong>Jason Solomons</strong></p>",
  "<p>Graham, the immigration and customs official at New York's JFK airport, is slumped behind his desk, a sour expression on his face. 'Reason for your visit?' he asks, barely bothering to look up from the fingerprint scanner. I tell him I'm here to interview Clint Eastwood. He stares at me, eyes widening in disbelief. 'Clint Eastwood?' he asks, suddenly wreathed in good cheer. 'I love that guy!' He jauntily stamps my passport and waves me through. 'Tell him I said hi.'</p> <p>The taxi driver whoops with joy when he finds out. 'Go ahead and make my day!' he shouts through the plastic dividing screen as we whizz across the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge at perilous speed. 'Do ya feel lucky, punk? Well, do ya?' The check-in clerk at reception in my hotel is also an Eastwood devotee. 'Tell him he's got a fan down here in the lobby.' The clerk shakes his head. 'I mean, jeez, he's a living legend.'</p> <p>Men have a thing about Clint. It is partly the way he looks: broad-shouldered and quietly heroic, as if chiselled out of a 6ft block of solid oak. At 78, his face is weatherbeaten like well-worn saddle leather, lined with the dips and grooves of experience. His eyes, flinty hazel and crinkled at the corners like paper twists of salt, seem perpetually to scan the faraway horizon, as if on the lookout for an ululating tribe of ferocious Native Americans.</p> <p>Then there's the back catalogue that reads like a checklist of male archetypes. In the Sixties, Eastwood was the 'Man With No Name' in Sergio Leone's iconic western trilogy A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. A decade later, he became Harry Callahan, the hard-bitten cop who played fast and loose with the rules in Don Siegel's Dirty Harry. More recently, In the Line of Fire saw him as a Secret Service agent, and he played a gruff boxing coach in Million Dollar Baby. His directorial two-hander, Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, took as its subject men in battle in the Second World War. In 1992, he directed and starred as a retired gunslinger in the Oscar-winning Unforgiven, a western that asked the quintessential male questions: what differentiates the hero from the villain? What separates a man from his myth? And why are the whores in movies always called things like 'Strawberry Alice'? </p> <p>Cowboys, cops, soldiers, boxers... It is difficult, when I eventually meet Eastwood in a chintzy hotel suite at the Waldorf Astoria, not to treat him as the embodiment of all that is most masculine and stoic. He is dressed, according to type, in a faded leather jacket, brown trousers and a beige striped polo shirt. He is one of the few male celebrities who, in reality, is just as tall as he looks on screen. He has, of course, a firm handshake.</p> <p>So it is a pleasant surprise to discover that Eastwood resolutely refuses to take himself seriously. He sneezes almost as soon as I walk into the room. 'I'm sorry, I'm ill. I can't do this interview now,' he twinkles. Thankfully, this is a joke. He sits down on one of the suite's two sofas and spreads a large hand over each knee with the acute deliberation of someone whose limbs are not quite as well-oiled as they once were. He will be 80 in two years and I have been told that he is mildly deaf, though there is no sign of this: if he asks me to repeat something, it is generally because I have not been precise enough. </p> <p>He has a pleasingly old-fashioned and gentlemanly turn of phrase. When Eastwood is really riled by something, he calls it 'BS' in case the term 'bullshit' offends my dainty female ears. Angelina Jolie, his latest leading lady, is 'an extremely attractive gal' and later, as I am leaving, he calls me 'duck' (it is meant affectionately - I'm sure ducks can be attractive, too).</p> <p>When I ask how it feels to be a living legend of male iconography, he laughs - a throaty chuckle that sounds like the crackle of tinder burning. 'It makes you feel old. I joke about it. I say it's just that I outlived everybody else. We lost Paul Newman the other day and, you know, he and I were approximate ages - I came just behind him - and then Steve McQueen, James Coburn, all those guys, we all were around at the same time and most of them are gone now.</p> <p>'Out of that whole group, I think, there's Dustin Hoffman, James Garner, and that's about all that's left.' He pauses. 'And me. I'm in the mix there.' He shifts forward and looks at me sideways. He grins, revealing a set of absurdly straight, white teeth, like a freshly painted picket fence. 'You just keep having a good time and making films and having a good life.'</p> <p>It is a philosophy that inspires a prodigious work rate. Over the past five years, Eastwood has directed at the rate of a film a year. Three of them - Mystic River, Letters from Iwo Jima and Million Dollar Baby - won Academy Awards, including his second Best Director Oscar for Million Dollar Baby (the first was for Unforgiven in 1993). The Human Factor, a biopic of Nelson Mandela starring Morgan Freeman, is in pre-production and he has almost completed directing and acting in yet another film, Gran Torino</p> <p>Behind the camera, Eastwood has achieved a level of artistic respect he never quite managed as an actor (Sergio Leone once remarked that he liked Eastwood because he only had two facial expressions: 'one with the hat and one without it'). As a director, Eastwood prefers to deal in dramatic narrative rather than special effects: his films tend to be bleakly compelling stories with several strands of subtlety, shot in richly textured shades of penumbral light. He is renowned for his low budgets and unpretentious attitude - he limits rehearsals and dislikes endless takes. Often, Eastwood composes his own soundtrack. He is not one to dwell on the tortuous creative demands of his art.</p> <p>'At some point, after you've done this for so many years, you kind of think, well, everything is do-able, it's just a question of how difficult it can be,' he says. 'I don't sit there and worry about it. You just do it. It's not like somebody's standing you up there and saying, \"OK, recite the Greek alphabet\" or something.'</p> <p>His latest offering, Changeling, came with its own set of challenges. It is set in late-Twenties Los Angeles and it took months to find a suitably preserved neighbourhood - most of the older buildings in LA have been torn down to make room for superhighways and shopping centres. In the end, location scouts discovered a tree-lined block of period homes in the Old Town district of suburban San Dimas, about 35 miles east of downtown LA.</p> <p>Changeling tells the extraordinary true story of Christine Collins, a single mother who returned home from work one day to find that her nine-year-old son, Walter, had disappeared. After a five-month investigation, the Los Angeles Police Department claimed to have found him, but Collins (played by Angelina Jolie) remained convinced the boy was an impostor. The police refused to believe her and had her incarcerated in a psychiatric ward, accusing her of being delusional. An interwoven plotline deals with the police investigation into serial killer Gordon Northcott. Northcott, who abducted and sexually abused dozens of young boys on a ranch in Wineville, California, was hanged for murder in 1930.</p> <p>'It's a tough one for parents to watch,' Eastwood says. 'It's a woman's horror story - the dilemma of being a woman in the Twenties and the dilemma of losing a child and what to do when you don't have a political system or a police system that would come to your rescue.'</p> <p>It is also a hauntingly sinister piece of work, laced with intimations of depravity. As in Mystic River, the viewer is offered stark relief from the dominant themes of corruption, murder and paedophilia. 'I don't mind telling a dark side,' says Eastwood, with characteristic understatement. 'Drama usually has some sort of intense conflict. Crimes against children are the most heinous crime. That, for me, would be a reason for capital punishment because children are innocent and need the guidance of an adult society.'</p> <p>Northcott was given two years' solitary confinement before he was led to the scaffold - a sentence Eastwood admiringly calls 'creative'. Although he describes himself as 'libertarian', he is unapologetically in favour of the death penalty. 'I guess it's because I have a very fertile imagination and I always sympathise with the victim. I never sympathise with the accused unless there's a chance the accused is not guilty, but I certainly don't ever sympathise with the criminal. I mean, I'm not one of these guys who sits around saying, \"Gee, I mean, the person had a strange childhood and that's why he's doing this horrible thing. Poor Jeffrey Dahmer. He's just had a bad childhood and that's why he's eating people.\" Wait a second! This person should be removed from the planet.'</p> <p>Later, when the conversation has somehow strayed on to Islamic fundamentalism, Eastwood is similarly outspoken. 'Imagine somebody telling some 12-, 13-, 14-year-old kid: \"Put on a vest, go out and blow up people and then you'll go to Heaven and there'll be 72 virgins.\" I mean, imagine the stupidity of that from our point of view. You think, wait a second, you don't even know if there is a hereafter and, if there is, what's so great about virgins?'</p> <p>Serial killers and virgins aside, one of the most notable things about Changeling is that it is driven by a complex female protagonist, a woman whose strength is forged through fragility and desperation. Million Dollar Baby, which featured Hilary Swank as a waitress-turned-boxer, was also dominated by a portrayal of female strength in adversity. For all that he is indelibly associated with overpoweringly male roles, does Eastwood feel equally at home directing films about feisty women?</p> <p>'I mean, I love stories about women.' A pause. 'I'm not a chick-flick enthusiast,' he adds, hurriedly, 'but that's what I like about this [Changeling]. It's a wonderful story of what this woman had to go through and how she has to change and what it does to her life. And that, to me, is a film that is reminiscent of the Forties, of Bette Davis or Joan Crawford or somebody who was trying to overcome something. It seemed like the stories there involved the women more, rather than them just being, you know, fluff. I like that a lot.</p> <p>'Every picture has its own demands and every picture stimulates something within you to tell it a certain way. I don't know what that is; I don't think too much about that.'</p> <p>What does he, a lifelong Republican, make of Sarah Palin, John McCain's 'bit of fluff' vice-presidential nominee? 'You can't help but like her. She's got a certain charm. Because of the way she talks and everything, she's obviously from a rural area, but that's refreshing in a way. I like her [...] But, uh, whether she... whether any of these people would be good on a presidential basis remains to be seen.'</p> <p>Eastwood had his own flirtation with politics for a brief period between 1986 and 1988 after he was elected mayor of small Californian town Carmel-by-the-Sea with 72.5 per cent of the vote. Was he ever tempted to take his political ambitions on to the national stage?</p> <p>'Me?' he asks in a tone of complete surprise, as if there might be someone else in the room. 'No, not at all. When I was Mayor of Carmel people would come and ask me to run for state office. Painters would hang from buildings and shout, \"Hey, Clint! Why don't you run?\" And I said, \"Not a chance.\" I enjoyed being Mayor of Carmel, but you do see that it is very difficult to get things done. You just have to lose your soul. You have to BS people. You have to deal with people you don't care for and will never be friends with, so you kind of sell yourself out to be a politician. You have to kiss it up with the world. That ain't my style.'</p> <p>Clinton Eastwood was born to be big. His Wikipedia entry states that when his mother gave birth he weighed 14lbs (6.4kg). When I check the veracity of this, Eastwood is horrified. 'Fourteen pounds!' he exclaims. 'No, no. You read that where? Wow. Everything is so exaggerated!' </p> <p>There is a short silence for his astonishment to subside. 'No, I was 11 pounds.' That's not a huge difference, I say. He lets this sink in. 'Yeah,' he concedes, 'it's still pretty big. That was me: a big, fat guy. I was the biggest baby born at the St Francis Hospital [in San Francisco] at that particular time. My mother overate, I guess.'</p> <p>Eastwood had an itinerant childhood, moving around from city to city as his parents tried to find work in the grip of an economic depression. His father, Clinton Sr, was a steel worker. 'I moved around a lot. I was born in 1930 and lived in various towns in California, up and down: Sacramento Valley, Los Angeles for a little bit, Oakland, all these areas. But I had good parents who I think did the best they could, so I had a reasonable childhood. It was kind of lonely in some ways because you never went to the same school for six or seven months, you were always moving on somewhere. But it was OK.'</p> <p>His mother, Margaret, once said in a television documentary that the rootless nature of his upbringing meant that Eastwood often invented imaginary friends. This, she thought, was what led to his becoming an actor. The experience also left him with an abiding memory of what it was like to live on a limited income. 'It seemed like in those days, you had what you had and nothing more,' he says. 'In other words, if you had 10 dollars, you had 10 dollars. You didn't have 1,000 dollars on a credit card that you could just ring up. Nowadays we live in a dream world that offers you something for nothing.'</p> <p>After graduating from high school in 1949, Eastwood worked variously as a gas station attendant, a bar-room piano player and a firefighter before being drafted for a short time during the Korean War (he never saw action). He acted in several B-movies before getting his big break, starring as Rowdy Yates, the hotheaded cowboy in long-running television series Rawhide. The series turned him into a household name and brought him to the attention of Sergio Leone, who cast him in the first instalment of the Dollars trilogy in 1964. Eastwood has not been out of work since.</p> <p>In the old-school Hollywood style, Eastwood embarked on the obligatorily chequered private life. He married model Maggie Johnson in 1953, with whom he had two children, Kyle and Alison. At the same time, he fathered an illegitimate child with Roxanne Tunis, a Rawhide extra - his daughter Kimber's existence was not made public until 1989. </p> <p>Clint and Maggie divorced after Eastwood admitted a long-term affair with actress Sondra Locke, his co-star in several films. Locke and Eastwood were together for a tempestuous 14 years, during which time he had two further children, Scott and Kathryn, with air hostess Jacelyn Reeves. In her imaginatively titled autobiography The Good, the Bad and the Very Ugly, Locke claimed Eastwood locked her out of the house, tapped her phone and persuaded her to have two abortions - allegations that Eastwood has always vehemently denied.</p> <p>An affair with actress Frances Fisher, his co-star in Unforgiven, produced another daughter, Francesca. His current wife, Dina, is a television anchorwoman, with whom he has an 11-year-old daughter, Morgan. The couple, who live happily on a sprawling ranch on California's Monterey peninsula, met in 1993 when Dina was interviewing him for the local news: she was 28 to Eastwood's 63.</p> <p>In spite of the ups and downs of his libidinous personal history, for most people, Eastwood will forever be inextricably linked with the western. But he says the genre is now in danger of being stifled by 'same old, same old' storylines. 'Down the line, someone has to come up with a new and imaginative approach or story. I'm a story guy. Unforgiven was the last truly great western I've ever read. For me, that was because it was telling a lot of things in different ways [...] I think back, [to all the] various westerns I've done and I think I've done about as much as I can with it.'</p> <p>He shifts backwards slightly on the sofa and gives me a languid smile. I am reminded of something Steven Spielberg once said of him: that the most wonderful thing about Eastwood's transition from bit-part actor to acclaimed film star and award-winning director was 'watching Clint remain the same man he's always been; that is to say, totally unimpressed with himself'. </p> <p>When I quote this back to him, Eastwood looks down at the parquet floor and scratches his right ear embarrassedly. 'Ahhh, I never think about it,' he says, hand flapping as if swatting away a fly. 'I never sit and analyse myself. Somebody - I can't remember if it was Burt Reynolds - once said: \"The trouble with Clint is that he doesn't realise he's a star,\" and I said: \"Well maybe that's a good thing.\" I mean, I just thought of myself as an actor trying to do parts and stuff. I'm a movie actor, not a star. </p> <p>'Everyone has to be a star now, but even that's not enough: you have to be a superstar. Where does it end? You can't be a model, you're a supermodel. When did this all come about? Everybody's trying to be so effusive. </p> <p>'I figure I'm just a guy doing pictures, that's all. I'm trying to tell stories and I do the best I can with them and if somebody thinks they're OK, fine, and if somebody doesn't, then that's their opinion and we move on from there.'</p> <p>He might not consider himself a superstar, but I feel sure that Graham at customs and immigration would disagree.</p> <p>\u2022 Changeling opens on 28 November</p> <p><strong>Clint as director: Boston to Boxing</strong></p> <h2>The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)</h2> <p>In 1999, Eastwood said the favourite of all his films was this unusual, complex western, made in the shadow of Vietnam, which takes a classic Eastwood loner, Josey Wales, and hitches him to a motley bunch of drifters. Wales, a Missouri farmer-turned-outlaw embittered by Civil War atrocities, becomes the group's unlikely leader.</p> <h2>Unforgiven (1992)</h2> <p>One of Eastwood's most widely praised films, Unforgiven does a brilliant job at deconstructing the romance of the western gunslinger. The film is set in 1880s Wyoming and Kansas, and the conceit is a familiar one - the retired gunfighter (Eastwood) who picks up his weapons for one last score - but Eastwood steers clear of easy resolutions. The film won four Oscars, including best film, best director and best supporting actor for Gene Hackman, memorable as a sadistic sheriff.</p> <h2>Mystic River (2003)</h2> <p>A brooding drama about childhood friends shattered by one terrible event and dragged back together, 25 years later, by another. The terrific cast includes Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, who both won Oscars for their performances, and Kevin Bacon. Working-class Boston, through Eastwood's lens, is grey and purgatorial.</p> <h2>Million Dollar Baby (2004)</h2> <p>Eastwood won his second directing Oscar for this tough, downbeat boxing movie, which also bagged best film. Hilary Swank plays a 32-year-old amateur eager to be trained by Eastwood's grizzled gym owner, Frank Dunn. Dunn, who has lost touch with his daughter, reluctantly takes her on and the film follows her rise through the ranks. </p> <h2>Flags of Our Fathers/Letters From Iwo Jima (2006)</h2> <p>Eastwood's epic diptych of the 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima explores the bloody conflict from both sides. The first film, from the American perspective, questions the notion of the national hero. The superior second film adopts the point of view of the Japanese as they dig themselves into their suicidal positions on the small Pacific island.</p> <h2>Changeling (2008)</h2> <p>Changeling tells the bizarre true story of Christine Collins, whose young son Walter went missing in 1928. When a boy claiming to be Walter turned up five months later, Collins refused to believe it was her child. The police in turn refused to believe her and placed her in a psychiatric ward. The film premiered at Cannes last May.</p> <h2>What's it like working with Clint?</h2> <p><strong>Angelina Jolie:</strong> 'He is, to me, very much the ideal man. He is absolutely who he is. He has very, very strong, decisive opinions and is very gracious as a man, as a friend and somebody on set as a director, too.' </p> <p><strong>Morgan Freeman: </strong>'He spends his time getting the film made. He doesn't direct the actors. He directs the film.' </p> <p><strong>Hilary Swank:</strong> 'He's the most amazing collaborator. When all is said and done and you've watched the movie, his fingerprints are all over it. And you didn't even notice the gentle guidance because he's so subtle and so simple.' </p> <p><strong>Kevin Bacon:</strong> 'Meryl Streep had told me, \"You're really going to like working with Clint.\" There was no rehearsal, maybe two or three takes. That kind of implies a hurried atmosphere, but it was actually relaxed, the most prepared set.' </p> <p><strong>Tim Robbins:</strong> 'Clint is a true artist in every respect. Despite his years of being at the top of his game and the legendary movies he has made, he always made us feel comfortable and valued on the set, treating us as equals. It was a great experience.'</p>",
  "<p>British foreign secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidmiliband\">David Miliband</a> and his French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, flew into Goma, capital of the war-torn east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) yesterday, amid warnings that hundreds of thousands of people displaced by fighting were facing a humanitarian disaster. </p> <p>Miliband arrived in the city after meeting the Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, as part of desperate international efforts to prevent the DRC slipping back into all-out war, which has claimed more than five million lives since 1998.</p> <p>The two will now fly to Kigali in Rwanda to meet President Paul Kagame, who is accused of supporting Tutsi insurgents. They said yesterday they were urging the full implementation of existing peace agreements between Congo and Rwanda, and the disarming of militias. They are also encouraging a swift meeting between Kabila and Kagame to negotiate an end to the conflict.</p> <p>Foreign Office Minister Lord Malloch-Brown said yesterday that British and EU troops might have to be sent if all else failed.</p> <p>As the European diplomatic initiative swung into action, the first eyewitness accounts began to emerge from the area of the towns of Rutshuru and Kiwanja - 60 miles to the north of Goma - which have been the epicentre of the worst fighting following an offensive by Tutsi rebels loyal to renegade General Laurent Nkunda, which was followed by killings and looting by Congolese army troops. </p> <p>Despite a ceasefire announced on Wednesday by Nkunda, the fighting has driven tens of thousands of civilians from their homes in North Kivu province on the border with Rwanda, emptying the camps around Rutshuru and triggering warnings from aid agencies of a 'catastrophe'. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said the main emphasis of the Miliband visit was 'to implement the existing Nairobi and Goma agreements towards a political settlement'. Key unresolved issues that help sparked the renewed crisis have included the failure to implement agreements on transitional justice, the integration of rebel troops into the Congolese army and guarantees to allow the return of internally displaced. </p> <p>Concern is growing over the fate of 50,000 people pushed out of the camps. Witnesses described how the camps had been emptied - some by armed rebels from the CNDP of Nkunda - and several clinics and shelters burnt. They also talked of desperate and chaotic scenes as tens of thousands fled northwards.</p> <p>A Congolese aid worker with Caritas-Goma, delivering his first consignment of blankets and plastic sheeting for emergency shelters in Rutshuru for the British charity Cafod last week, got caught up in the violence in the town. Edie Yamawanzeylo and his colleagues became trapped between fleeing Congolese soldiers - who pillaged their vehicles - and the advancing forces CNDP. </p> <p>'The camps were emptying,' he said yesterday. 'The people were all on the road without shelter or heat. Some said they were going voluntarily. But in other places we saw villages that had been destroyed and houses burnt. There was looting and chaos. </p> <p>'This is where the worst of the fighting has been taking place', added a spokesman for the UNHCR refugee agency, disputing claims that the camps were hotbeds for Hutu fighters after the Rwandan genocide of 1994. 'The people in these camps were simply not Tutsi like the CNDP. The idea that there are large numbers of Hutu fighters is a fantasy. This has been about seizing territory.'</p> <p>Another witness to the fighting was British surgeon David Knott, who recently returned after working in the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res clinic in Rutshuru. 'It started in August. We would be getting four or five cases with war wounds - almost exclusively bullet wounds - one day and then there would be an upsurge in the fighting and we would see 20 cases come in. It carried on like that until October, when we were dealing with 70 cases a day. Sometimes the workload was just phenomenal. I was absolutely exhausted. The wards were overflowing ,so we built tents in the grounds to deal with the overflow.'</p> <p>As the fighting grew worse Knott was increasingly at risk. 'I was stopped on the road to Goma by this crazed Congolese soldier who jumped out and was screaming and screaming. I could smell the alcohol on his breath and feel the barrel of his rifle in my shoulder.'</p> <p>Yesterday, as the CNDP staged a celebration rally in Rutshuru, it was eerily quiet. While the CNDP spokesman announced that the roads were open and Rutshuru safe, a Reuters correspondent found locals scared of Nkunda's men. Residents said they resented the presence of the rebel soldiers, whom they described as coming from Rwanda. </p> <p>'We're not happy with these people, because they want to take power and destroy our democracy,' complained local farmer Kavusa Magazine. 'What are they going to do for us?'</p>",
  "<p>The crowd could sense history in the warm Florida air. They had come from miles around. The town was called Sunrise. The assembled thousands wanted to see the man who stands on the brink of being the first black president of the United States.</p> <p>Dan Bernard, 49, had brought his three young nephews and nieces. They had driven for hours. 'I wanted them to see history. I want them to look back when they are grandparents and be able to say: \"I was there\",' Bernard said.</p> <p>It was a common sentiment. Obama himself shared it. 'At this defining moment in history, you can give this country the change we need,' Obama told the cheering throng, prompting an ear-splitting level of noise. One of the most extraordinary elections ever fought has brought the American people to within two days of casting their vote. They will either elect a young, liberal black Senator from Chicago or an old, conservative war hero. Their choice will affect the entire world.</p> <p>It has been an astonishing journey. The titanic struggle has fascinated people around the globe. Most of that attention has been focused on Obama. He has brought a touch of the rock star into American politics. From Berlin to St Louis, he has appeared in front of crowds of 100,000 or more. He has raised more money than any other presidential candidate in history. His candidacy has resembled more a social movement than a political campaign. It could end by making a black American the most powerful man in the world and signal a once-in-a-generation change in America. 'He's black and he's got a Middle Eastern-sounding name. Yet the country is positioned to vote for him for president. That's enormous,' said Professor Seth Masket, a political scientist at the University of Denver.</p> <p>But it is not over quite yet. The election that has spanned almost two years still has two days to run. John McCain and the Republican party remain in the race. They are behind in the polls in the battleground states, but the gap has narrowed recently. McCain has struck a fiercely populist note and he knows how to fight. All of McCain's great triumphs - in war and in politics - have come against the odds. 'Nothing is inevitable here. We never quit. We don't hide from history. We make history,' he told an enthusiastic crowd in Mentor, Ohio last week. The beaming grin on his face showed that McCain believes he can do it. But it will not be up to him. This race will be decided by tens of millions of Americans at the polls. Only then will the watching world know who will next occupy the Oval Office. They will know if the greatest election in recent history has a final twist in its tale.</p> <p>The election has already been an epic for Obama. His quest for the White House began what seemed like an age ago. In February 2007, at the 'winter meeting' of the Democratic National Committee in Washington's Hilton hotel, each Democratic hopeful gave an introductory speech to a crowd of activists. They laid out their stall. Obama's stood out only because it was so bare compared to his ribbon-draped rivals. There were no campaign placards. No badges or posters. Just a sign-up sheet and a few pens placed on a desk manned by two young volunteers. </p> <p>Yet from that humble beginning sprang one of the largest political movements since the Civil Rights era. It has been a triumph of organisation in the technology age. Utilising the internet and driven by tech-savvy young staffers, it has changed the face of American political campaigning. It has 3.1 million financial contributors. The campaign's Facebook page has 2.2 million supporters. It is set up in cyberspace and in more than 700 campaign offices in every state in America, including ones where Obama has no chance of winning. No matter. Through time and money, everyone can still contribute. And they do. Obama has raised $640m so far. That has allowed him to outspend and outgun first Hillary Clinton and now McCain. Nothing demonstrated his advantage better than his half-hour national TV advert last week. Previously only eccentric billionaires such as Ross Perot could afford that. Now Obama shrugs off such expenses, too.</p> <p>No one expected his campaign to change politics this way. As the first black American to win a major party nomination, Obama was thought likely to face an election dominated by race. Yet his candidacy changed things there, too. He ran an explicitly 'post-racial' campaign, heralding a new type of politics. Obama's rallies attract blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians. They reflect a changing American society, in which younger generations are less obsessed with race. </p> <p>'America has moved past a lot of these racial stereotypes,' said Patrick Dejour, a business consultant at the Sunrise rally. Dejour is black but married to a white woman and their children are - like Obama - of mixed race. 'That's why he's attracted so many people. We just don't see this as being about race,' Dejour said. Experts agree, and predict that will be a Democratic strength in the years to come as minorities make up a larger proportion of America's population. 'We are dealing with a country and a generation that feels that diversity is a growing part of who we are,' said Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and former member of Bill Clinton's famed campaign 'War Room'. </p> <p>But Obama could not avoid the race issue altogether. Indeed, it posed the biggest threat to his campaign. When videos of Obama's pastor, Jeremiah Wright, giving a racially charged speech hit the internet, race became briefly central to the campaign. Everyone noticed the elephant in the room. Obama seized the issue directly. In a speech called 'A More Perfect Union', delivered in Philadelphia, he appealed for America to understand its racist past, but also to move beyond it. </p> <p>Not everyone did. In various forms - such as rumours of him being a Muslim or snide remarks at him not being a 'real' American - Obama's opponents have sought to be portray him as the Other. But it hasn't worked. 'For the most part, race has been background noise,' said Masket. Obama has consciously reached out to the white working class, which is most likely to resist electing a black man. He has done it in a conciliatory manner, as a political moderate. Thus Obama - a black liberal - is returning the Democrats to the American South. In Virginia, North Carolina and Florida, Obama is turning once fiercely red states to shades of blue. It is yet another unexpected turn in his remarkable candidacy.</p> <p>Yet none of it would have been possible without Hillary Clinton. The epic nomination battle that began in Iowa and threatened to continue to the convention floor at Denver forged Obama as a candidate. It meant his skeletons popped out of the cupboard early on. It gave him a ground organisation in each state. The debates sharpened his skills and the media wars honed his team into ruthless professionals. It also stunned pundits with the sheer size of the voter turnout, dwarfing the Republican contest. 'The biggest surprise was the scale of voting. The turnout has been simply amazing. That was the sign that things were really going to be different this time,' said Greenberg.</p> <p>The nomination fight made Obama as a politician. He stayed cool, calm and collected and so when the greatest challenge of the election - the economic crisis - hit, he was unruffled. As McCain rushed back to Washington, Obama kept his head. As America's economy started to bleed and its financial system collapsed, Obama looked more like the stuff presidents are made of. The polls decisively broke in his direction. McCain has been scrambling to catch up ever since. Yet it has taken its toll. The brutal campaign has put Obama through a physical and emotional wringer that few can imagine. 'No one really understands what its like. It's exhausting,' said two-time former Democratic presidential hopeful and Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich. But the effect on Obama was clear. Even at a distance at the rally in Florida, one could see that Obama's once youthful head of hair has become deeply flecked with grey.</p> <p>But Obama has not yet won. McCain and the Republicans are fighting hard, especially in the key state of Ohio. No Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio and McCain hit the state last week in a two-day bus blitz. With him was the man who has become the last-ditch 'working man' symbol of the Republican campaign: Joe Wurzelbacher - 'Joe the Plumber'. In Mentor, Ohio, a small working-class suburb of Cleveland, Wurzelbacher was given a hero's welcome by several thousand people who crammed into Mentor High School's gym. He told them he was voting for a 'real American' in the shape of McCain. McCain was gleeful and strident: 'I have been in a lot of campaigns and I have seen momentum. I can feel the momentum in this room tonight. I can feel it. I can feel it.' </p> <p>He will need it. Obama has bitten deep into Republican territory, appealing to white-working class voters, rural voters and the 'exurbs'. Only a last-minute wave of support, or some unforeseen flaw in the opinion polls, can propel McCain over the finish line in first place. His support is vocal and numerous, but feels out of touch with changing American concerns. The campaign has portrayed Obama as a socialist, someone who will raise taxes. Or a dangerous radical who 'pals around' with terrorists. It has worked for the party's core support. 'I don't like Obama. I don't like Marxism. It is not American,' said Mark Kopan, an IT consultant who wore a T-shirt opposing anti-illegal immigration. </p> <p>But even here, inside the hall, grumbling disappointment was not hard to find. McCain's real problem has not been Obama. It has been the past eight years of Republican rule and President George W. Bush. In poll after poll, it has been obvious that Americans everywhere desperately want a change in direction. Now the cracks are starting to show in the once-formidable Republican machine that as recently as 2005 was plotting the creation of a 'permanent majority' in US politics. The cracks have spread to the McCain campaign itself, revealing a split between McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin. Their supporters have sniped at each other through anonymous leaks to reporters. The conservative right of the party has already planned a meeting later this week in rural Virginia to discuss how the party should move forward after election day. Many experts believe the Republicans face civil war. 'The next two years, maybe longer, will be a time of internal conflict and soul-searching and messiness,' said Larry Haas, a political commentator and former aide in the Clinton White House.</p> <p>But last week in Ohio, McCain's campaign was still planning a victory in the must-win state. 'We are going to do it the old-fashioned way. We are going to have to earn it,' said Ohio congressman Steve LaTourette. If McCain wins here, if he sweeps Mentor and the hundreds of communities in Ohio like it, he has a chance. But if he loses, Obama will be president. Everything is at stake. That is why no one is taking Ohio for granted. 'Ohio can break your heart,' said Kucinich.</p> <p>The choice Americans face on Tuesday is between the liberal versus the conservative; the warrior versus the conciliator; the old versus the young; and, finally, black versus white. On the campaign trail last week, the two sides felt starkly different. Even the town names suggested a fight between experience and optimism: Mentor versus Sunrise. The queues for Obama's event began hours before it opened and stretched for miles. There was a carnival atmosphere inside a vast stadium. For McCain, it was a school gym and the queue never left the car park. Inside, it was patriotic shouts of 'USA! USA!' McCain launched into a scathing attack, playing on the familiar themes of cutting taxes, supporting the military and boosting Joe the Plumber's working-class authenticity. Meanwhile, Obama's rhetoric soared amid talk of unity and change. His running mate, Joe Biden, introduced him with a speech that mentioned a pantheon of American political Gods: Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. </p> <p>But hubris is dangerous. The final words do not belong to any politician. They belong to American voters. Their collective decision could put a black man in the White House, or it could reject him for an ageing warrior who found his political soul-mates in the form of an Ohio plumber and a Hockey Mom. America is at the crossroads.</p>",
  "<p>Where would modern cinema be without Guy Maddin? Certainly not in Winnipeg, a place of somnambulist enchantment in which householders are required by law to provide shelter for sleepwalkers and horses stampede from infernos to freezing rivers where they become ice sculptures, their rampant heads serving as park benches for the curious locals. </p> <p>Rumour has it that this otherworldly escapade - a 'docu-fantasia' in colourful black and white - was commissioned by the city fathers as a down-the-line celebration of their beloved home. The narrative tone is sonorously 'factual', yet how much of this alternative history should we believe? Did the town really embrace a long-running soap opera entitled Ledge Man, in which Maddin's mother (played here by Forties B-movie star Ann Savage) would talk some suicidal desperado down from a high window every episode? Is there really a surreptitious taxi trade serving backroads and alleyways that do not appear on any maps, crisscrossing the city over a maze of hidden rivers through which the true blood of the locals flows?</p> <p>Who knows? Certainly not this viewer who opted simply to believe in Maddin's magical world in the same way that I 'believed' in films like Tales From the Gimli Hospital or The Saddest Music in the World. Fans of early David Lynch will find a kindred spirit in Maddin's surreal monochrome vision, while his infatuation with the archaic mechanics of early cinema yields peculiarly modern dividends.</p> <p>By strange coincidence, My Winnipeg also serves as an eerie companion piece to Terence Davies's enrapturing Of Time and the City, a similarly personal account of his home town which could easily have been called 'My Liverpool'.</p> <p>Oh, and did I mention that it's poignant, truthful and hilarious? That much, at least, you can take as fact.</p>",
  "<p>The trunk show for Tinc - the tiny San Francisco-based fashion label - is New York Fashion Week's most achingly hip, most secretive event. It is held on a sticky day in early September, on the sixth floor of an anonymous warehouse building located 20 blocks down from the big tents and the main action of Bryant Park. Its designer, Savannah Knoop, greets a handful of fashion-week hipsters - the edgiest stylists, the most fashion-forward fashion editors - oh, and me. She rolls out her clothes on two chrome rails, so that we can cop a feel. She encourages us to try her creations on in the loos located halfway down a darkened corridor; she feeds us with farmers'-market brownies and a wine-punch concoction. There is no runway show, no models, no music, no scary clipboard ladies, and no reverence.</p> <p>Tinc is brilliant. Androgynous, sharp, well-structured, well-fitting, cooler than Christmas. I don't care that 'Tinc' means 'throwaway' in Thai; that it's as green, as a company, as it possibly can be; that the pieces are spiritual one-offs, individually numbered and fashioned from unusual fabrics. I don't care that the logo is a visual representation of the soundwaves created whenever anyone says 'I love you'. I just care that it's good. </p> <p>No doubt about it, Savannah Knoop is an excellent designer. But the other thing she is, is an excellent liar. Accomplished, adventurous, and daring. I know this because, for six years, Knoop lived a lie. For six years, Knoop perpetuated one of the biggest literary hoaxes of modern times. </p> <p>The Noughties have been an outstanding time for literary hoaxes. In 2006, James Frey was exposed as inventing parts of A Million Little Pieces, his memoir of a lifetime of drug addiction. This year, it transpired that Love and Consequences, Margaret B Jones's memoir of growing up as a mixed race, drug-running foster child in South Central Los Angeles, was the fabricated work of private-school-educated, all-white Margaret Seltzer. Stephen Glass turned his multiple journalistic hoaxes into a professional identity; his story became the subject of a 2004 film, his 2003 autobiographical account of the hoaxing having done very nicely indeed, thank you. </p> <p>But the best - the most extravagant, most starry, most decadent - literary hoax de nos jours, was committed in the name of JT LeRoy. </p> <p>Jeremiah 'Terminator' LeRoy was the Aids-afflicted, emotionally damaged son of a truck-stop prostitute, who'd spent his teenage years living rough on the streets of San Francisco and turning tricks, who'd had a male-to-female sex change; and who overcame all this, and more, to became a literary wunderkind. In 1999, his first novel - Sarah, the story of a child prostitute, which was presumed to be semi-autobiographical - was published, to critical acclaim; within a year, LeRoy was the darling of a hip, indie celeb crowd. He was friends with Winona Ryder (who claimed she met him before he was published, while he was still living rough, hanging about outside the opera house, 'a real ragamuffin'), with photographer Juergen Teller, with Courtney Love. Madonna sent him Kabbalah readings; he was a confidant of Liv Tyler ('who told him everything'). He made the cover of Vanity Fair - in 2003, the magazine ran a gushing story on him, in which they praised his writing abilities extravagantly ('To literary critics and his fellow writers, JT LeRoy has distinguished himself as a precocious talent able to mine golden prose from his white-trash childhood ...'); drew comparisons with immense cultural icons ('In public, LeRoy maintains a Warhol-like mystique. He wears wigs, female apparel, and oversize sunglasses, and he seldom says a word. And yet he can give better phone than Warren Beatty, drawing powerful women into his world with his raspy, girlish drawl') and wondered whether or not his ever-expanding coteries of adoring female celebrity fans will 'make his career, or break it?' (In March 2005, he also made the cover of the Observer Magazine, which ran a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/06/fiction\">reverent and sincere interview</a> with him.) He was a house-guest of Carrie Fisher. Shirley Manson wrote a song about him; the actor Michael Pitt played an approximation of him in Gus Van Sant's adaptation of his collection of short stories, The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things. Designers clamoured to dress him, magazine editors clamoured to commission him. Asia Argento - the Italian film actress and director - had a relationship with him. For six years, JT LeRoy was the hottest, hippest, brightest, most intriguing literary sensation in the world. </p> <p>Which was great, except - he didn't exist. His books were written by Laura Albert, a fortysomething woman who had been a punk, a phone-sex worker, and a porn author, but had never lived on the streets of San Francisco or worked as a teenage prostitute. Savannah Knoop - Albert's twentysomething sister-in-law - had played JT publicly. Knoop bound her breasts, and wore a preposterous blonde wig and sunglasses, affected a West-Virginian accent; and appeared as JT whenever a physical boy was needed. Knoop gave JT's press conferences, she partied on his behalf, she travelled the world as him, doing readings and signings. She posed as him on photoshoots. She had dinners with the directors and actors who optioned LeRoy novels as films; she hung around on set and advised when these films were being made. She had friendships as JT. She had the love affair with Asia Argento.</p> <p>Everywhere she went, Knoop was accompanied by Albert, who posed as Speedie, JT's 'handler'. This allowed Albert to feed Knoop lines when necessary, and cover for any gaps in 'his' knowledge, any biographical discrepancies. </p> <p>For six years, it worked. People bought into JT, to a greater or lesser degree. They didn't ask too many questions. One journalist who spent time with JT LeRoy and Speedie when they came to London on a promotional tour says simply: 'We knew something was up, just not what, exactly. And it was fun; they were fun.' </p> <p>Then, inevitably, Albert and Knoop were found out. In October 2005, Stephen Beachy, a reporter from New York magazine, published his suspicions that JT LeRoy was the pen name of Laura Albert; shortly after that, Warren St John, a writer on the New York Times, published his suspicions that Knoop played JT's physical alter ego. The whole story emerged pretty quickly after that; Geoffrey Knoop (Knoop's half-brother; Albert's then husband), revealed everything he knew, in an article in the New York Times in February 2006.</p> <p>Two years of fallout ensued. Albert's was visible and intense - she was successfully sued for fraud by the film company who optioned Sarah; she split from Geoffrey Knoop. </p> <p>Savannah Knoop, meanwhile, slipped from public view - effortlessly, because no one really knew what she looked like. She was not legally accountable for the hoax; consensus among those celebrities (and non-celebrities) who had been hoaxed, was that they were less wronged by Knoop than by Albert, who, it was felt, had pulled the strings. </p> <p>But now, Knoop is revisiting the affair. She's written a book, Girl Boy Girl, an account of her six years as JT LeRoy; it's published in the UK next week. Laura Albert is extremely cross about the whole thing. When she heard that Knoop was planning a book, she said: 'I am not in any way connected with this book and it disgusts me. Just because you play a writer doesn't mean you are a writer. I think Savannah is being motivated by money and attention. Now that she's had to go back to being a civilian, this is her way of getting back to it. It's sad and it's sleazy. She's really stepping on my feelings ... I'm not interested in making a career of JT, I'm an artist.'</p> <p>But Knoop's unapologetic about her endeavour, and happy to tell to me all about it.</p> <p>So I meet Knoop at the Tinc trunk show. Knoop's always made clothes on the side - she is that kind of a girl. Since the demise of JT LeRoy, she's developed this dabbling into a serious fashion concern. </p> <p>No one else at the trunk show has ever heard of JT LeRoy. The editors and stylists are completely clueless about Savannah Knoop's brilliant and preposterous back story. Then I meet Mary Ellen Mark, the photographer who shot Knoop as JT LeRoy for Vanity Fair in 2003, and who was the only person to address the issue of JT's gender identity directly at that time. 'I've hung out with many transgendered people over the years,' Mark told JT, after their shoot, 'but I don't feel the residue of a boy with you. JT, you don't feel like a boy to me.'</p> <p>At the Tinc show, Mark embraces Knoop, who introduces her to me. </p> <p>You're the one who knew, I say. </p> <p>'Of course I knew!' Mark tells me. She gestures up and down at Knoop, who is standing feet away from her. 'Look at her! She looks like a girl!'</p> <p>And she does. </p> <p>Knoop and I meet again, the following morning over brunch.</p> <p>'Gosh, this all feels very ... intimate,' she says. </p> <p>Because I know lots about you from reading the book, I say. </p> <p>'Right,' she says. 'And it's not that I ... wouldn't tell you those things after a while; but I wouldn't tell you off the bat.'</p> <p>We start with biographical facts, of which there are many more knocking around for JT LeRoy than for Savannah Knoop. Knoop tells me that she was born in 1981 ('the same year as JT, I think ...') which makes her 27, although she seems older. Her family is extravagantly extended. Her father, John Knoop, is a big deal on the San Francisco film-making scene; her mother, Sharon Hennessey, is an acupuncturist and teacher, writer and film producer. John already had three children when he met Sharon; together, they had a daughter, Hennessey (whose surname is Knoop, you'll be relieved to hear); 10 years later, they had Savannah. Knoop's parents split up when Knoop was five, John Knoop moved out, but maintained a decent relationship with his daughters. Knoop and Hennessey grew up to have close relationships with their half-brothers and sisters. </p> <p>She was, she says, 'a little weird, as a kid. I mean, I got on with other kids, but ...' (Knoop trails off a lot, leaves sentences unfinished, perhaps because she hasn't yet got her thoughts in order; perhaps, because this, too, is an evasive tactic she picked up while playing JT.) She went to an all-girls boarding school, which she really loved ('There was minimal cattiness compared with co-ed'); and she meant to go to college, but somehow didn't. 'I was floating, out of high school. Trying to work out what I wanted to be doing.' Her half-brother Geoff began a relationship with Laura Albert; they had a band called Thistle, they needed a singer, and they recruited Knoop. 'I didn't even want to be a singer. Can I sing? Kind of. Really, I think they were just looking for somebody who was ... younger.'</p> <p>Simultaneously Albert, who had written a smattering of short stories as JT LeRoy, was beginning to gain profile, and had realised that she'd need a physical JT. She began by approaching fey young men on the streets of San Francisco, and attempting to explain to them what it was she was looking for. She graduated on to butch young women. But she couldn't find anyone quite right. 'I was wishing, hoping, that Laura would ask me to do it,' Knoop says. 'In my mind, I thought: OK, you need these two slots to be filled - JT, and a singer for the band - and I'd rather be in that slot, the JT slot.'</p> <p>Why?</p> <p>'I was intrigued by the idea of being someone else. I was obsessed by the whole idea of androgyny.'</p> <p>Because you're bisexual?</p> <p>She laughs. 'Queer. But, yeah...'</p> <p>You've had relationships with women as well as men?</p> <p>'Yes.'</p> <p>Did that help you become a boy?</p> <p>'Probably. It's about inhabiting both.'</p> <p>After trying unsuccessfully to recruit a stranger to play JT LeRoy, Albert saw a photo-booth snap of Knoop, and realised that she would make a good JT. Days later, Knoop bound her breasts for the first time, put on the blond wig and sunglasses as extra disguise, and posed for pictures that would accompany a small magazine interview Albert had already given over the telephone. She was petrified, but the shoot went well. Chris, the photographer ('I've forgotten his surname, and the name of the magazine'), accepted Knoop as JT. The story ran. </p> <p>They had, Knoop says, absolutely no idea what they were getting themselves into.</p> <p>'I think we were both, like: let's try this out. But no. I don't think we had any idea what was going to happen.' </p> <p>Was Knoop perpetually scared she'd be found out?</p> <p>'Yes! Terrified! Though she [Laura Albert] wasn't! She wasn't! I was constantly, so scared all the time. Every time we would do anything. But she always thought we'd be fine. It never crossed her mind.'</p> <p>What did you think would happen if you were discovered?</p> <p>'I don't know. I just knew it would be bad.'</p> <p>It's hard to know exactly how things evolved from that point. Knoop's memory of the next six years is fractured and muddled; even after reading Girl Boy Girl, I'm not a lot clearer on what happened when. It's an excellent yarn, and it's well written (contrary to expectations, Knoop is a natural writer), but it is circuitous, and Knoop is not a rigorous researcher. When she forgets things - names, details, places - she makes something up, and asterixes the relevant section. Which is charming, but not exactly informative.</p> <p>What we do know is that, in the space of 18 months, JT LeRoy garnered a trendy and adoring public, a cult celebrity following and a luxurious lifestyle - although that wasn't a constant for Knoop. When she wasn't playing LeRoy, she went back to San Francisco where she waitressed in a Thai restaurant, and no one had any idea about her dual life. </p> <p>You had to work?</p> <p>'Yes!'</p> <p>Playing JT didn't make you rich?</p> <p>She laughs. 'Nooooo!'</p> <p>Did the constant adjustments between the two lifestyles become confusing?</p> <p>'It screwed with my head! There was nothing special about the way I was going through my early twenties - apart from JT. What I loved so much was harbouring that secret; and going back and being able to say to myself: these guys don't know what's going on! I'm here! And I'm there, too!'</p> <p>JT LeRoy's relationship with Asia Argento is perhaps the most intriguing element of Knoop's experiences. She says that she's lost contact with everyone she met as JT, apart from one man, who was so unsettled by the truth that he doubted everything for a while. 'There was this thing where he was looking at everything and going: is this real? Is this spoon real? It shook, you know, everything. The truth that he thought he ... had.' But he did not sleep with JT LeRoy. Asia Argento did. </p> <p>Asia Argento met JT LeRoy on a book tour in Italy for Harold's End, LeRoy's last novel. Argento had been emailing Albert, as LeRoy, for a few months before that, but she transferred all her attentions to Knoop. They began a relationship.</p> <p>Argento must have known something was up.</p> <p>'She says she didn't! I don't think she can admit that she knew something was up. I think she probably did.'</p> <p>Because you were close - on every level. </p> <p>'Right.'</p> <p>Physically close...</p> <p>Knoop laughs. 'Right! Everyone goes, she was so naive to think anyone could have had a perfect sex change. But I don't know ...'</p> <p>I ask her if she felt guilty about cheating Argento into a relationship with her; Knoop doesn't really answer. 'It was unsettling, to be with her, and not be ... although I spent enough time with her at the end, so that basically I felt like we connected on so many other things. And it was this whole thing. At some point, I told Asia that she should call me Savannah. I don't know why.'</p> <p>Perhaps so that you could merge JT's identity with your own? So you could feel like you were telling her the truth, without actually telling her the truth?</p> <p>'Exactly. Right. It was all so close to the truth by that point. Anyway, she didn't call me Savannah. She always called me JT.'</p> <p>Did you fall in love with her?</p> <p>'I don't know.' She seems exasperated. 'I question that. It wasn't quite falling in love. I wanted her ... to tell me I was OK.'</p> <p>Perhaps Knoop doesn't feel guilty about Argento because Argento hurt Knoop. When Argento, Knoop and Michael Pitt were working together on the film adaptation of The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, Argento invited Knoop, as JT, and Michael Pitt, back to her hotel suite - and chose to spend the night with Pitt. Knoop was devastated; the whole episode is documented in Girl Boy Girl</p> <p>Do you think she's angry with you?</p> <p>'I think she's angry.'</p> <p>Are you sorry for that?</p> <p>'I feel like I want to talk to her about it.'</p> <p>Are you still angry with her over Pitt?</p> <p>'To a degree.' Pause. 'I read an interview about how she felt ... and the only thing she said was, she honestly thought I was a boy, because I had such hairy legs. She'd never seen such hair on a girl's legs! And I think: that's all? I think that if she read the book, she would understand why I did it. But I think we should ... talk about it. Hash it out.'</p> <p>I like Knoop very much. She is charismatic and engaging, and I find it exciting that people still do these kinds of things - have these exciting, preposterous adventures. I think she wanted to write her story for all the reasons she gives me - to get it down, to get it straight, to 'stop it falling through the cracks'. But also I suspect that Laura Albert's right when she suggests that Knoop misses the limelight, and this is her attempt to reclaim it. Knoop says she doesn't want to be famous: 'No! Not at all!' But she freely admits to feeling incredibly lost once the hoax was exposed. She admits that she misses the experience of JT LeRoy desperately, and that she misses having secrets 'to the point that I started trying to get other secrets, new secrets'. She laughs about that. She tells me that she loved being JT, that it was addictive, and fun 'and exciting and glamorous! He was really glamorous!'</p> <p>Would she have ever stopped being him, if she hadn't been found out?</p> <p>'No. I don't think so. No.'</p> <p>So maybe Savannah Knoop does want another go at celebrity, maybe she hasn't even quite admitted that to herself. She will say that she wants Tinc to grow, 'but not too big, I want to keep it close'; and that she wants Albert to make some peace with Girl Boy Girl. 'I think she just needs to start writing again.'</p> <p>So, I say, you want Laura Albert to get over it, and Asia Argento to get in touch?</p> <p>She grimaces.</p> <p>'I don't want that to be, like, my calling card! No! Like: call me, Asia! No! If our paths are meant to cross, then they will.'</p> <p>Do you believe in all that?</p> <p>'Probably not,' Savannah Knoop says. 'But sometimes - it happens anyway.'</p> <h2>Girl Boy Girl: Savannah faces the Italian press as JT LeRoy</h2> <p>At a JT LeRoy press conference for 'his' last book, Harold's End, in Rome, Savannah Knoop, disguised as JT, is accompanied by her sister-in-law and 'manager' Laura Albert and Loretta from the Italian publishers. It was here that she met, for the first time, Italian actress Asia Argento, with whom she then had an affair.</p> <p>Loretta dragged me to the podium. I could hear everyone getting into their seats. There were red glowing blindspots burned into my retinas. I could barely see Asia and Laura settled into two seats in the front row. Loretta tapped at the microphone and started to introduce me in Italian. I was shaking, and every so often I would jerk my head, like I was trying to pull a crick out of my neck. </p> <p>She said something and everyone laughed wryly. I could tell she was wrapping it up now. 'I present JT.' </p> <p>They clapped. Laura gestured to me to say something. I mustered a low 'Hi'. Someone coughed. What were they waiting for? Were they second-guessing me? People raised their hands. Loretta pointed at them. She seemed to know all of them. </p> <p>'Yes, Antonia.' Antonia shot off a question. Loretta nodded her head. She said, 'Ah, they want to know, what are the wig and glasses for?'</p> <p>I was relieved that we had started with something easy. 'Um,' I breathed heavily into the microphone, 'I put so much into the books. I wear the wig so that people won't recognise me, so that I can keep something for me that's personal. Same thing with my eyes.'</p> <p>I pushed a last breath into the microphone. The sunspots were receding. In practically all the interviews, this question came up in one form or another. The most direct had been in another city, when an interviewer said, 'You could be anybody. How do we know you are who you say you are? I mean, you sound like a woman to me.' The rest of the reporters muttered and shook their head at him, indignant that he had asked such a question. I would be saved each time by remembering Laura's rule: always go in further to get out. </p> <p>'Um, you don't know. And you won't know. And I don't want you to know. JT could be back in Spokane, a 500-pound black man, like that guy, the voice of Elmo, right? Some people say I am Dennis Cooper. Some people say I am really Gus Van Sant. I like that. I mean, yer absolutely right. I could be anybody. As fer sounding like a woman, thank you.' I curtsied. </p> <p>'You wrote on your website that writing is your lifesaver. Is it still true? Is it your raison d'\u00eatre?' My raison d'\u00eatre, I thought bitterly, is to put on a wig and speak in a lousy Southern accent.</p> <p>'Uh, yeah. I think it is the same today ...'</p> <p>'In your novel, Sarah says, \"We all need someone to know who we really are\". Today, do you know who you are?' </p> <p>'Um, no. No, I don't think I do.' </p> <p>After it was over, the reporters took a flurry of pictures, and I realised that the sunspots were actually from flashbulbs. Loretta led me off the podium. I stubbed my sneakers on the bricks and stumbled off.</p> <p>\u2022 Girl Boy Girl: How I Became JT LeRoy is published by Seven Stories Press.

  "<p>It's hard to imagine why humans would have chosen the achingly arid stone desert of Wadi Faynan for their first settlement. But water would have been one important reason, says archaeologist Steven Mithen. When Neolithic men and women arrived 11,500 years ago, things were very different: the climate was cooler and wetter; the landscape was covered in vegetation including wild figs, legumes and cereals, and there would have been wild goats and ibex for meat.</p> <p>Initially WF16, as it's now called, would have been a seasonal camp. But Mithen, professor of early prehistory at the University of Reading, and his fellow archaeologist Bill Finlayson believe that, gradually, people stayed longer. Sifting evidence from so long ago, the archaeologists can't be sure, but remains of food from different seasons and the scale of 'rubbish' piles suggest that about 10,000 years ago the inhabitants stopped moving altogether. If they are right, it would make this one of the oldest sites ever found where humans made a permanent settlement, learned to farm, and changed the course of human civilisation. But the tiny community drawn to water, which attracted successive waves of settlements, would eventually all but destroy the resource which made life possible. It is a pattern that's been repeated for millennia, around the world, and it now threatens us on a global scale.</p> <p>First people cut trees for shelter and fuel, until rains swept away the soil instead of seeping into shallow aquifers, and the springs dried up. At least as long ago as the Bronze Age, farmers began mankind's obsession with diverting water for crops to feed the growing population. Meanwhile, the moist, cool climate which encouraged the first settlement was naturally becoming drier and hotter.</p> <p>At least twice, historians believe, Wadi Faynan was abandoned. The first time possibly because of a sharp change in the climate, and later because it became too polluted. Today, Bedouin who survive in the valley have laid pipes down the dry stream bed to suck what is left of the spring in order to irrigate fields of tomatoes they have scratched out of the dry soil. But it's getting harder. According to local water lore, good rains now come in less than every other year.</p> <p>The farmers in Wadi Faynan are not alone. Like communities around the world, they are paying the price for thousands of years of exploitation of our environment. Already, 1bn people do not have enough clean water to drink, and at least 2bn cannot rely on adequate water to drink, clean and eat - let alone have enough left for nature. Lack of water is blamed for many of the world's most distressing crises: millions of deaths each year from disease and malnutrition, chronic hunger, keeping children away from schools which offer hope of a better life. Mostly it is the poor who suffer, but increasingly rich nations are struggling, too. Australia has endured so many dry years that a leading climatologist has said it's time to stop saying 'gripped by drought' and accept that the lack of rain is permanent. </p> <p>In parts of the US supplies are so vulnerable that last autumn the Red Cross delivered water parcels to the town of Orme in Tennessee. 'I thought, \"That can't be the Red Cross. We're Americans!\"' resident Susan Anderson told a reporter. In California, some farmers abandoned their crops this year as Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared the first state-wide drought for 17 years. Meanwhile Barcelona was so desperate that it began importing tankers of water from cities along the coast. Even in the notoriously wet UK, water has become such a problem in the crowded southeast that one company plans to build a desalination plant, the sort of desperate measure associated with oil-rich desert states.</p> <p>The Stockholm International Water Institute talks about 'an acute and devastating humanitarian crisis'; the founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, warns of a 'perfect storm'; Ban Ki-Moon, the United Nations Secretary General, has raised the spectre of 'water wars'. And, as the population keeps growing and getting richer, and global warming changes the climate, experts are warning that unless something is done, billions more will suffer lack of water - precipitating hunger, disease, migration and ultimately conflict.</p> <p>In a bid to avert this catastrophe, politicians, economists and engineers are pressing for dramatic changes to the way water is managed, from tree planting and simple storage wells, to multibillion dollar schemes to replumb the planet with dams and pipes, or manufacture freshwater from sewers and the sea. </p> <p>The water crisis is an expression of the environmental catastrophe of human over-exploitation. This is the age the Nobel prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen has called 'the Anthropocene', because the natural system has been so fundamentally altered by human activity. And it all began when people settled down and began to chop wood and farm.</p> <p>'The start of sedentary communities is the start of the need to manage fresh water supplies,' says Steven Mithen. 'This is a starting point for our whole modern dilemma. It's gone from the concerns of individual settlements, to cities, to nations, and it's now a global issue.'</p> <p>There is, in theory, plenty of water on the earth to sustain its 6.5bn people. More than 97 per cent of all the water on the planet is salt water, and most of the freshwater is locked up in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. But that still leaves 10m cubic kilometres (km3) of usable water, circulating in cycles of evaporation and precipitation between the atmosphere and earth, where it appears in underground aquifers, lakes and rivers, glaciers, snowpacks, wetlands, permafrost and soil. Each km3 is equivalent to 1,000bn litres, or 1bn tonnes, of water - about the remaining annual flow of the River Nile. </p> <p>On the other side of the equation, the UN says individuals need five litres of water a day simply to survive in a moderate climate, and at least 50 litres a day for drinking and cooking, bathing and sanitation. Industry accounts for about double the average domestic use. But agriculture needs much, much more - in fact, 90 per cent of all water used by humans. The water is not 'lost' from earth, but over-abstraction by irrigators means it is often moved from where it is needed. Tony Allan, of King's College London, estimates that, together, 6.5bn people need 8,000km3 of water each year - a fraction of what is theoretically available. 'There's certainly enough water for every person on the planet, but too often it's in the wrong places at the wrong times in the wrong amounts,' says Marq de Villiers, author of the 2001 book Water Wars</p> <p>Three hours north of Wadi Faynan is the much greener Wadi Esseir, where Salah Al-Mherat and his family are one of millions of households in Jordan who feel the daily effects of inhabiting one of the driest countries on earth. Once a week, Al-Mherat gets water from the local irrigation co-operative for his fig, lemon, olive and grenadine trees and vegetables. For the rest he relies on rain. But since the Nineties the springs have been drying, sapped by demand from the nearby capital, Amman, and rain has been declining. </p> <p>On a hot morning in April, Al-Mherat comes in from picking petits-pois, hitches up his smock and settles on to a pile of cushions. Fidgeting with a pot of scented tea he explains that the crops now barely cover their costs; he has to work as a security guard to supplement his income. 'When I started it was very good compared to now,' he says. 'The first impact was that the size of the irrigated area became reduced. People also changed what they irrigated, so the water now goes mainly to the trees - some farmers stopped completely from doing vegetables.' Al-Mherat says he keeps hoping things will improve, because he will pass the land to his sons. 'It's my life,' he says. 'But even if I'm positive, the reality is it's like the wish of the devil to go to paradise.'</p> <p>Global population, economic development and a growing appetite for meat, dairy and fish protein have raised human water demand sixfold in 50 years. Meanwhile, supplies have been diminished in several ways: an estimated 845,000 dams block most of the world's rivers, depriving downstream communities of water and sediment, and increasing evaporation; up to half of water is lost in leakage; another 1bn people simply have no proper infrastructure; and the water left is often polluted by chemicals and heavy metals from farms and industry, blamed by the UN for poisoning more than 100m people. And still the rains are getting less reliable in many areas.</p> <p>Underlying these problems is a paradox. Because water, and the movement of water, is essential for life, and central to many religions, it is traditionally regarded as a 'common' good. But no individuals are responsible for it. From Wadi Esseir to the arid American Midwest, farmers either do not pay for water or pay a fraction of what homeowners pay, so they have less incentive to conserve it and might deprive suppliers of funds to improve infrastructure.</p> <p>The UN defines 'water scarcity' as fewer than 1,000m3 of renewable clean water for each person every year to drink, clean, grow food and run industry. By this measure half the world's population lives in countries suffering water scarcity. Jordan is one of the most water-scarce countries on earth, averaging just 160m3 of renewable water per person per year. </p> <p>The result is that it is not just farmers who are rationed. The Al-Mherat family, like the rest of greater Amman, only get water to their house one day a week. A city of more than 2m people runs to the rhythm of 'water day', says Dr Khadija Darmame, who is part of a \u00a31.25m project organised by Mithen and sponsored by Britain's Leverhulme Trust to study links between 'water, life and civilisation' in Jordan, from the earliest settlements to modern day. </p> <p>Poor supplies and stagnant tanks occasionally lead to infections. But for most, the problem is drudgery. 'The first thing is to do the maximum laundry and then clean the house,' says Darmame. Children and men take a shower, 'and the last thing is for the women to take a shower, and then you need a few hours to fill the tanks,' stacked on every roof. </p> <p>For millions of others, bad supplies are a question of life and death. Lack of clean drinking water and sanitation are largely blamed for the death of 11m children under five each year from disease and malnutrition; for nearly 1bn people who are chronically hungry; for 2bn who suffer what the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization calls 'food insecurity', because they do not have adequate food and nutrition for an 'active and healthy life'; and for keeping more than 60m girls out of school. These people then get caught in a water and poverty trap: two-thirds of the people who lack enough water for even the most basic needs live on less than $2 a day. 'Variability of water availability is strongly and negatively related to per capita income,' says Professor Jeffrey Sachs, author of Common Wealth: Economics For a Crowded Planet, and a special adviser to the UN Secretary General. Poor health, lack of education and hunger make it hard to escape. </p> <p>Ultimately, lack of water is seen as a threat to peace. From genocide in Darfur to rows between states in India and the US, Ban Ki-Moon is one of several global leaders who have warned of further legal and armed disputes over water. Intuitively it is obvious people will fight over their most precious resource, but so far few conflicts have broken out. The idea of 'water wars' seized the public imagination in 2001 when Marq de Villiers's book of that name was published in the UK, but the author disagreed with the publisher's choice of title. De Villiers agrees that water is often an underlying cause of tension, but has only identified one water 'war', between Egypt and Sudan. 'You cannot do without water, so when shortages pinch, states do co-operate and compromise,' he says.</p> <p>But if half the world's population lives in water-stressed countries, how do so many, from the breadbaskets of Asia to the sprawling cities in the arid American west, keep watering fields and running taps?</p> <p>One reason is that water flows uphill to money, as the saying goes. Thus people in oil-rich Kuwait enjoy expensive desalination, while Palestinians suffer daily hardship; tourists in Amman can turn on the tap at any time, while those in the poorest areas of the city have access to water for a few hours each week. As Tony Allan says: 'Water shortages don't pose serious problems to gardeners in Hampshire or California homeowners with pools to fill.'</p> <p>Another answer to the conundrum was identified by Allan, who in the Sixties became curious about why Middle Eastern countries without abundant water supplies were not suffering from a more obvious water crisis. The answer, he realised, was trade: by buying food, water-poor societies were 'buying' what he dubbed 'virtual water'. They were helped by farmers dumping grain into the world market once subsidies created massive over-supply. 'This potential tragedy was motoring on and hit the calm waters of the Americans and Europeans providing food [for the world market] at half cost, and the water contained in that food [was water] they didn't have to find.' </p> <p>The other answer is that communities around the world have been forced to tap rivers and lakes and aquifers, sometimes millions of years old, far beyond the limit at which they can replenish themselves. Above ground, lakes are shrinking and rivers are being reduced to pathetic flows, or drying up altogether. Below ground, a largely invisible crisis is unfolding as millions of wells have been sunk into aquifers - 4m in Bangladesh alone. Many aquifers are replenishable, but not all, and many that can be recharged don't get enough rain to match demand. Sometimes the empty cavities simply collapse, putting them beyond use forever. In his recent book, Plan B 3.0, Lester Brown catalogues the results. In the breadbaskets of China, India, the US, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Israel and Mexico, water tables are falling, sometimes by many metres a year. Pumps are being drilled a kilometre or more to find water, thousands more wells have dried up altogether and agricultural yields are shrinking. These countries contain more than half the world's people and produce most of its grain, warns Brown. Meanwhile, almost forgotten amid the human suffering are the terrible consequences for the natural world: freshwater fish populations fell by half between 1970 and 2000, says the UN.</p> <p>All these dams and irrigation channels and pumps and pipes allow billions of people to run up a gigantic global water overdraft. What worries experts is that there is no sign of humans withdrawing less water.</p> <p>Two years ago, the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) published a report by 700 experts warning that one in three people were 'enduring one form or another of water scarcity'. 'Scarcity for me is when women work hard to get water, [or] you want to allocate more but can't,' says David Molden, deputy director of the Sri Lanka-based organisation.</p> <p>Molden warns that the situation is becoming 'a little bit more critical', because of continuing rising demand for food, the recent boom in biofuels and climate change. To that can also be added another, poignant 'demand': the long-overdue realisation that nature also needs water, which in Europe and other countries has led to laws to ensure 'minimum environmental flows' remain in place.</p> <p>For food alone, the World Bank estimates that demand for water will rise 50 per cent by 2030, and the IWMI fears it could nearly double by 2050. Whether these crops require rain or irrigation depends on where they are grown, and how much rain there is. </p> <p>Like a great river fed by many tributaries, water is a conduit for the various effects of global warming: more variable rainfall, more floods, more droughts, the melting of glaciers on which 1bn people depend for summer river flows, and rising sea levels, threatening to inundate not just coastal communities but also their freshwater aquifers, river deltas and wetlands. </p> <p>From the headline figures, climate change should be good news. Crudely, scientists estimate for every 1C rise in the average global temperature, precipitation will increase one per cent, as warmer air absorbs more moisture. The world's total volume would not change, but it would be recycled more quickly, affecting the majority of the world's agriculture which depends on the volume and timing of rainfall.</p> <p>Balancing all these impacts, Nigel Arnell, director of Reading University's Walker Institute for Climate Change, calculates that the number of people living in water basins exposed to water stress will rise from 1.4bn to 2.9-3.3bn by 2025 and to 3.4-5.6bn by 2055. In fact, the greatest impact in Arnell's modelling is from rising populations, particularly in China and India, and, globally, climate change is actually reducing exposure to shortages. This may be good news for some, but masks huge disruption, as some regions fear too much water, while hundreds of millions of people start to run out.</p> <p>It is impossible to attribute one farm's difficulties or one year's rainfall to climate change. But if climate is the statistics of weather, then the rain gauge this year on the farm of Sameeh Al-Nuimat, northwest of Amman, is typical of what the experts forecast. Al-Nuimat had noticed a gradual decline in rainfall for years, but this year it dropped off steeply and there was no rain at all in March, a critical time for summer crops. 'My father told me he'd never seen such a year,' he says.</p> <p>Such dramatic events have injected urgency into discussions about Jordan's precarious water supplies, says Al-Nuimat, who is also an irrigation engineer at the Ministry of Agriculture. 'Before, when water was available, no one worried about it. But now there's interest - every night people speaking, every night debating, at every level, from the farmer to the planner to the politician. As a farmer I'd like to see drought-resistant crops; from a civil engineering point of view we should look for mega projects; and, if you're thinking about global planning, there should be acceptance of people moving from water-scarce regions to where water is available.' </p> <p>Around the world the same debates are under way. Rich countries can make significant gains from domestic efficiency, but most of the world's population does not have power showers and swimming pools, or waste great quantities of food. Instead the main focus is on reducing water in agriculture, through more efficient irrigation, by engineering seeds to grow in more arid and salty conditions, and even shifting crops. 'If the world were my farm, I'd grow things in different places,' says David Molden. But even benign-sounding conservation is often unpopular. There is widespread resistance to raising prices for water (or energy for pumping) to increase efficiency, suspicion of genetic modification, and a reluctance among farmers to abandon water-hungry but lucrative crops when they are struggling to feed their family. 'It's a socioeconomic dilemma,' says Al-Nuimat. 'You can't stop now: it's the source of their life.'</p> <p>Faced with public apathy and even resistance, responses have tended to focus on increasing supply. For decades the scale of ambition has been like a game of global engineering one-upmanship: rivers have been diverted across countries, pumps sunk kilometres into fossil aquifers, and bigger plants commissioned to recycle or desalinate water. And there is no sign of a let-up. As shortages become more desperate and costs and energy use fall, Global Water Intelligence forecasts that desalination capacity will more than double by 2015, and the potential to increase wastewater recycling is enormous, being only 2 per cent of volume. </p> <p>But huge costs, environmental concerns and public distaste for drinking their 'waste' has forced many communities to reconsider simpler, traditional methods, too. Some of the ideas the earliest farmers would have recognised: tree replanting, ripping out thirsty non-native plants, stone walls to hold back erosion, and rain harvesting with simple ponds and tanks. Some have even urged a return to more vegetarian diets, which at their extreme demand only half the water of a typical American meat-eater's. This is, according to Lord Haskins, the former chairman of Britain's Northern Foods group and a government adviser, 'the most virtuous and responsible step of all'.</p> <p>And when all options are exhausted at home, countries have another option: to import water in food and even industrial goods. Political meddling with subsidies makes trade a controversial 'solution', but by favouring regions with a 'competitive advantage' in water it can work. Globally the IWMI estimates irrigation demand would be 11 per cent higher without trade, and quotes a projection that imports can cut future irrigation by another 19-38 per cent by 2025. Saudi Arabia has gone further than most, announcing in February that it would stop all wheat production in a few years, though other countries might now be deterred by higher food prices.</p> <p>Ultimately governments are being forced down several paths at once: to raise prices to reflect the true value of water to humans and the environment, invest in technology to improve efficiency and supplies, engage in more trade, and make peace with neighbours that can hold up incoming water or food. These will only be possible, though, if people can be lifted out of poverty, to afford higher prices, capital spending and imports. 'When you diversify your economy you solve your problems,' says Allan.</p> <p>Looking back at the history of mankind's struggle for enough water, experience suggests the initiative which enabled humans to settle, farm and dominate the planet will provide many solutions. But sometimes we might have to accept defeat. 'On the one hand you can see this amazing technological ingenuity of humans, which throughout prehistory and history continually invented new ways to manage water supply,' says Mithen. 'On the other, the story of the past tells us that sometimes, however brilliant your technological inventions, they are just not good enough, and you get periods of abandonment of landscapes. We have got to be prepared to invest in technology, but also to recognise in some parts of the world there are going to be areas where we're going to have to say \"enough's enough\".'</p> <p>A person uses about 50 litres of water a day; industry accounts for double that. But agriculture needs much more - in fact, 90 per cent of all water used by humans.</p> <h2>Liquid assets</h2> <p><strong>How much water does it take to make a can of coke?

But taking the idea a step further on to food labels which would reach millions of consumers is proving harder, says Dave Tickner, head of the WWF UK's freshwater programme.</p> <p><strong>Is all water the same?</strong><br>Unlike carbon, water is a local issue. It is better to buy a kilo of wheat from water-rich Canada than from arid Australia, even if they only use half the amount of water Down Under.

  "<p>David Miliband flew in to the Democratic Republic of Congo yesterday to face, we were told, 'the toughest diplomatic challenge of his career'.</p> <p>The humanitarian organisations have been predicting catastrophe, Africa's posse of foreign correspondents is in situ and the British public is calling for something to be done.</p> <p>Part of me rejoices in this explosion of international concern, on the principle that anything focusing attention on this troubled region cannot be bad. But Congo's crisis is not unprecedented, nor is it unrivalled. To people who know the continent, there's something of an arbitrary quality as to how one crisis seizes the public imagination and others go ignored.</p> <p>The eastern town of Goma has seen far worse than this, including a biblical flood of Rwandan refugees in 1994, a cholera epidemic that left corpses lining its streets and a lava flow that turned the lake town into a mini-Pompeii. Those episodes made what is happening now seem insignificant. Suddenly, Western politicians are flagellating their electorate with the fact that nearly five million have died in the DRC in the last eight years. Comparisons are drawn to First World War death tolls.</p> <p>Such comparisons are spurious, as the organisation that produces the estimates for mortality rates - the International Rescue Committee - would be the first to admit. Terrible as the number is, these five million are not deaths in combat. The victims are children under five, claimed by the kind of diseases that are easily treated in regions where clinics operate, roads are passable and families can harvest their crops. No, the death toll is not the reason why the world suddenly cares about Congo.</p> <p>This is not the biggest refugee crisis in Africa, either. In Somalia, indiscriminate shelling by an occupying Ethiopian army and its government allies has left Mogadishu an empty shell. Fighting with an Islamist faction has created 1.1m internal refugees and sent 400,000 Somalis fleeing into neighbouring countries. Yet their plight is rarely mentioned. It seems we care about certain emergencies in Africa more than others. </p> <p>In Darfur, we probably cared because the American right, bolstered inadvertently by the likes of George Clooney and Mia Farrow, decided to see the crisis as a showdown between Christianity and Islam. In Somalia, the sheer danger of covering the story has kept the cameras away, as has the confusing fact that the party doing much of the damage - Ethiopia - is supposed to be an African good guy. </p> <p>With Congo, quixotic as it may seem, I would point the finger at a Polish seaman who became one of the finest writers in the English language. When Joseph Conrad published Heart of Darkness 1902, he intended it as a searing indictment of Belgian colonialism. When his dying antihero exclaimed: 'The horror, the horror', he was decrying the brutality within supposedly civilised man.</p> <p>But over decades, lazy headline writers and ignorant politicians came to use the phrase 'heart of darkness' as shorthand for all that frightens Westerners about Africa, the supposed primeval embodiment of our darkest human instincts. Congo's turbulent post-independence story sealed the vision of the country as some sort of benighted flag bearer for a cursed continent. The spell the word 'Congo' continues to cast over Western audiences should prompt some self-examination. Behind every well-meaning 'isn't it dreadful?' reaction lies a host of unstated and unappetising assumptions about Africans. </p> <p>\u2022 Michela Wrong is the author of In the Footsteps of <strong>Mr Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo</strong></p>"
