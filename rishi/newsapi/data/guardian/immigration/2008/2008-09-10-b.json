  "<p>Chinese officials launched a top-level investigation into North Shanxi's devastating mud and rock slide as the death toll rose to 128 and hopes faded yesterday for those trapped beneath the flow.</p> <p>State media initially blamed torrential rains for triggering the wall of sludge that obliterated buildings around a mine in Xiangfen, Linfen city, on Monday.</p> <p>But senior officials later said the disaster appeared to have been caused by the collapse of a waste reservoir at the Tashan iron ore mine.</p> <p>\"It was terrible. The mud roared down the valley and washed away the market and houses in a few minutes,\" Wei Guanghui, a migrant worker, told the China Daily newspaper.</p> <p>Other witnesses told the state news agency Xinhua that the torrent was several metres high and destroyed a three-storey office building.</p> <p>An official at the propaganda department of Xiangfen county warned: \"There were survivors on the first day and on the second day, but from day three, it's very likely that anyone we find in the future will be dead already.\"</p> <p>Speaking from the site by telephone, she told the Associated Press news agency that more than 2,000 police, firefighters and villagers were mobilised in the search.</p> <p>State radio has said that hundreds could be trapped beneath the thick layers of mud and debris, which covered a vast area thought to be up to two miles long. Many of the victims are believed to be migrant workers from south-west China, making it harder to know exactly who was there.</p> <p>The People's Daily newspaper said the state council - China's cabinet - had launched an investigation. Nine people, including the mine owner, have been detained.</p> <p>Xinhua said several officials, including the local head of the work safety bureau, had been sacked.</p> <p>\"Our preliminary investigation found that this accident was caused by illegal enterprises who discharged waste sand into a mine tailings dam,\" said Wang Dexue, deputy head of the state administration of work safety. \"When the dam reached its capacity it burst. Heavy rain accelerated the process,\" he told state television.</p> <p>\"It's not because of the rain. It wasn't a natural disaster, it was man-made,\" said a worker named Zhang, who said his friend was probably dead.</p> <p>China's mining industry is the world's deadliest, killing 3,800 people last year despite substantial safety improvements.</p>",
  "<p>The management consultants who lost a computer data stick containing the names, addresses and expected release dates of all the 84,000 prisoners in England and Wales were yesterday sacked from their Home Office contract.</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, announced she was terminating PA Consulting's \u00a31.5m contract to keep track of persistent offenders in the criminal justice system and was reviewing its other contracts with her department, valued at \u00a38m a year. The political embarrassment over this data loss is compounded by the fact that the company has been at the heart of developing the government's controversial identity cards project. </p> <p>An investigation was launched by the Home Office after PA Consulting reported that the data stick had been found to be missing by an analyst when she returned from weekend leave on August 18. She had left it in her desk drawer, which had probably been left unlocked, in an insecure part of the company's offices in Victoria, London. The investigation concluded that it was unlikely that the data stick had gone missing as a result of a targeted theft and was most probably pilfered or just lost.</p> <p>An assessment by the Association of Chief Police Officers has concluded that although there is a risk the information could be used to carry out revenge attacks, the chances of this happening are low.</p> <p>The home secretary said yesterday that the personal details of the prisoners had been transferred from the Home Office to the company in a secure manner but that they were later downloaded on to an insecure data stick which had been lost. \"Our contract had stipulated the sort of security provisions that needed to be in place and that had not happened,\" said Smith. \"We are cancelling this contract and we are urgently reviewing the way in which PA Consulting are meeting the requirements of other contracts we have with them.\"</p> <p>The company has been involved in a wide range of Home Office projects including the automatic number plate recognition scheme, introduction of a smartcard to make cash payments to asylum seekers, and the tightening up of visa applications. The decision to terminate its involvement in the J-Track contract, which monitors persistent and prolific offenders, could have serious implications for PA Consulting, whose annual contracts across government have been worth more than \u00a3240m since 2004.</p> <p>The company yesterday blamed the loss on the \"human failure\" of a single employee who was in breach of its security processes: \"We deeply regret this human failure and apologise unreservedly to the Home Office,\" said a statement. It said it had reviewed all its projects which involved sensitive data handling and concluded that this was an isolated incident.</p> <p>But the shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, said it was the latest in a long list of fiascos, based on the government's careless approach to data management: \"These serial failures are the result of flawed ministerial strategy. It is high time the Home Office, as well as reviewing PA Consulting's ID cards contract, scrapped that reckless scheme altogether.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Sahar Adnan</strong>, 38, and her son, Hussein Amir, 15, are Sunnis living in northern Baghdad with Sahar's five other children, the youngest of whom is two. Their father, a carpenter-turned-shopkeeper, was murdered by milita men. His body was never found. Initially, Sahar's brother-in-law took care of them but in 2007 he too was killed by gunmen. Now the family live in one room and depend on the support of neighbours. Hussein has recently returned to school after a break of three years during which his mother could not afford to pay for his uniform. He is trying to find a job to help his family. </p> <p>\"More than 20 gunmen came for my father,\" Hussein remembers. \"They put him in a four-wheel drive and I started to cry and one of them said, 'Don't be scared - everything will be OK.' Then the Americans came and they promised me they would bring back my father but they didn't. The Americans did nothing for us. If they stay or if they leave, it doesn't make any difference to me. I'm still waiting for them to tell me about my father.\" </p> <p>\"The Americans were here,\" says Sahar, \"and my husband was still murdered. When my husband was alive we lived a good life. Now I live on charity. My husband controlled my boys but now it is impossible. Since the Americans came to Iraq we have had nothing but trouble. It is better that they go and just leave us alone. They've been here for five years and we had no security - so what is the point in them staying? And before they go they could release all those Iraqi men they picked up and are still keeping in their prisons.\" </p> <p><strong>Anfal Abdul Sattar</strong>, 25, lives in Mosul with her three-year-old child, Zahra. A few months after her daughter was born, her husband, Muhammed, 33, was killed by a car bomb targeting an American convey in Baghdad.</p> <p>\"I live with my parents and my three-year-old calls my father daddy,\" she says. \"I have been looking for a job since I graduated from university last year but can't find one. The security situation in Mosul is bad, and my parents don't like the idea of me going out everyday for work. Still, I insist I must have a job to be able to take care of my only daughter. We do not need the Americans at all. They have been in Iraq for five years, and what did they do to us? Let them leave so all these car bombs and killing will stop.\"</p> <p><strong>Ban Alwan</strong>, 41, a Sunni with three children, lives in Baghdad. Her husband, Salman, was a pilot in the Iraqi army. He was taken from their bedroom by a militia gang in 2005. She searched the city morgues and found his body three days later. His teeth had been extracted and he had been shot between the eyes. The family live on a pilot's pension of \u00a3100 a month. Their electricity costs \u00a350 a month. </p> <p>\"I want to leave Iraq but where can I go? I applied to be a refugee in Sweden but didn't hear anything. I tried to find a job but there is no work. I don't go out much because things are not safe and if I am killed who will look after the three kids? We are between two fires: the fire of the Iraqi government and the fire of the Americans. I prefer the fire of the Americans. Yes, they are behind all the destruction in Iraq, and they have killed our men, but if they leave now the militias will kill us all.\" </p> <p><strong>Abdullah Khalid</strong>, 40, is an Arabic language teacher from Falluja. He has three children.</p> <p>\"The Americans? I hate even to hear their names, these criminals and infidels. What more do they want from us? They killed my young brother, Ahmad, 27, and my wife, Ahlam, 30, on the same day in 2005. I was at the school and got the terrible news that a US plane had bombed our house and my brother and my wife were buried under the rubble. I lost everything. The Americans' excuse was that they suspected the house was a haven for terrorists. Now they claim they have handed over the security responsibility to the people here. It is absolutely untrue - the Americans are everywhere and the Iraqi police do not have any weapons in their hands. I swear to God, if any Iraqi says, 'Let the Americans stay to protect us', he does not have any honour, any dignity, any morals. Let them get out of our country so that we can rebuild it. </p> <p>A thousand curses on them.\"</p> <p><strong>Hafidha Humaidi</strong>, 85, has three children, the eldest of whom is 65. She lives in Kufa, Najaf. </p> <p>\"I can hardly walk so I moved to my youngest son's house so he could take care of me. I see the Americans in the roads when I go to visit my other sons; sometimes they stop our car or check but I do not mind that. I am not scared of them at all; I wish they could visit me one day at home and see what is wrong with my legs. Maybe they will get me some good medication - I am using the same old tablets I used to have even before the war and they do no good. My sons and I are worried that if the Americans leave, chaos will return. It is better they stay.\"</p> <p><strong>Anwar Omran</strong>, 32, is a Kurd living in Dohuk, north Iraq, with his four children. He was working as a translator for the US forces in Mosul until recently, when he decided to quit the job after receiving death threats.</p> <p>\"A lot of my colleagues have been killed or kidnapped, and if you survive, any member of your family might pay the price. I decided to go back to my home town in Dohuk and my old job at the ministry of education. I would prefer the American forces to stay: the situation is still chaotic. If they leave, the situation will be wild, the strong parties will smash the weak. I am planning to leave; I heard that for people like me who have worked for the Americans, an office has opened in Irbil to arrange for us to go abroad. But my mother does not accept that. We will see.\"</p>",
  "<p>With a stagnant economy and Led Zeppelin performing, Britons could be forgiven for thinking they had travelled back to the 70s. This week saw yet more throwbacks, with the proposal of Labour MP Frank Field for non-EU migrants to be thrown out after four years - sorry, for \"balanced migration\", and the return of manpower planning. Oh dear.</p> <p>Field should know better than to team up with the Tory MP Nicholas Soames and MigrationWatch to put forward a \"one in/one out\" temporary-worker scheme. The plan is unfair, unworkable and harmful to the economy. Throwing out people who have been working here for four years would deprive us of people who have demonstrated their contribution to society and adapted to British life; it would also deter many talented people from coming. And since only a select few would be allowed to settle, with priority given to the rich and well-paid, Russian oligarchs and American investment bankers could doubtless stay while Asian acupuncturists and African nurses would be turfed out. This is Powellism dressed up in statistics. </p> <p>The Field-Soames plan is in tune with the Conservatives' sketchy plans for an immigration quota. Fortunately, the government has rejected it. Unfortunately, its own policies are not much better. It is pressing ahead with a new points-based system, modelled on Australian lines, for vetting workers from outside the EU. </p> <p>This system will allow a top tier of highly educated people to enter, while slamming the door on those with fewer skills. Among a middle tier, only those with a job offer in areas where a shortage is deemed to exist will be admitted. On Tuesday, a government-appointed committee of wise men and women delivered a provisional shortlist of shortage occupations, which the government is due to finalise in October. Doctors, secondary-school teachers and social workers are no longer welcome, nor are midwives, most nurses and, crucially, care workers. </p> <p>Neil Kinnock once warned Britons not to be young, not to fall ill, and not to grow old; and the government will now be turning away people from Kenya or the Philippines who could help meet the desperate need for carers for the young, the old and the sick. With suitable British applicants vanishingly few and Polish workers increasingly going home as the plunging pound devalues their wages, pensioners will not just be struggling with fuel bills this winter, they will be shamefully short of care. The immigration minister, Liam Byrne, trumpets how \"tough\" the new system is, but it is toughest on the weakest and poorest.</p> <p>While there are lots of things that Britain might want to import from Australia - such as its wine and cricketing success - its devilishly complicated system of micromanaging immigration is not one. Governments are no good at second-guessing the ever-changing labour needs of complex modern economies. Even if the government could somehow ascertain whether Britain needs more IT staff or welders right now - its advisory committee says not - it certainly can't predict what the economy will need a year from now. Only a year ago estate agents were in hot demand; now bailiffs are.</p> <p>The new points system is like an 11-plus for foreigners. It prejudges how people will contribute to society and denies opportunity to those who don't make the grade. It would have turned away most of the people on the Windrush, the father of Olympic hero Kelly Holmes, and - had he been born abroad - a young Richard Branson. A Labour government should know better. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Philippe Legrain is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780316732482\">Immigrants: Your Country Needs Them</a></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mail@philippelegrain.com\">mail@philippelegrain.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The seven years since 9/11 reveal an old truth: problems are usually not solved, they are just overtaken by other problems. Those of 8/8, for instance. On August 8 2008, two mighty nations announced their return to history. Russia, invading Georgia, did it with tanks. China, launching the Beijing Olympics, did it with acrobats. The message was the same: world, we're back.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong. A grave threat from jihadist terrorists, potentially armed with atomic, biological or chemical weapons, hangs over us still. They have a faith-based ideology with proven appeal to a minority of disaffected Muslims, especially those living in the west, and the means to wreak cut-price mayhem are alarmingly easy to find. Even as you read this, another hard-to-detect groupuscule, working in a back room close to you, may have taken the occasion of the 9/11 anniversary to try again. They won't always be foiled. Protecting us from another 9/11, while not destroying our freedom in order to save it, remains a major challenge to political leadership in every free country. </p> <p>What has proved false is the neoconservative claim that this single threat defines the whole pattern of world politics in our time; that, as Norman Podhoretz puts it, the struggle against Islamofascism is world war four. Returning to the United States after a year's absence, I'm struck by how relatively little even the American right is talking about the \"war on terror\".</p> <p>Beyond terrorism, two giant changes define our world. Both can, to a large extent, be traced back to the worldwide spread of marketised economic development (or globalisation). The first is the \"rise of the rest\", made manifest on 8/8. Non-western powers challenge the economic dominance of the west. They are beating the west at the game it invented, and quietly changing the rules along the way. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that by 2040, China, India, Russia, Brazil and Mexico will have a larger combined economic output than today's G7. The date matters less than the trend. Even today, the shifts in economic power are translating into political and military power faster than many anticipated. </p> <p>At the same time, worldwide economic development on the basis of the free movement of goods, capital, services and, to a lesser extent, people, is exacerbating transnational problems. CO2 emissions that accelerate climate change, mass migration, the risk of pandemics: all these cry out for international, cooperative responses. The need for liberal international order has never been greater. Yet, by contrast with the 1990s, when president George HW Bush hoped to replace the cold war with a \"new world order\", the prospects of achieving it no longer look so good. Power is diffused to too many competing states, many of them illiberal, as well as elusive networks like al-Qaida.</p> <p>So we of the FLIO (friends of liberal international order) must now confront the prospect of a new world disorder. Or rather old-new, for disorder rather than order is the more natural condition of international society. International order, which may also be called peace, is a fragile achievement. It hardly needs repeating that in its response to the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration has, over these seven lean years, contributed to the erosion, rather than the building, of international order. The Russian invasion of Georgia was, among other things, payback for the US invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>While order is threatened, liberty is no longer on the forward march. The French refer to their 30 years of economic growth after the second world war as the trente glorieuses. Future historians may regard the three decades from Portugal's revolution of the carnations in 1974 to Ukraine's Orange revolution in 2004 as trente glorieuses for the spread of liberty, in Europe but also in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia. </p> <p>Russia and China are not just great powers challenging the west. They also represent alternative versions of authoritarian capitalism, or capitalist authoritarianism. Here's the biggest potential ideological competitor to liberal democratic capitalism since the end of communism. Radical Islamism may appeal to millions of Muslims, but it cannot reach beyond the umma of the faithful except by conversion. More important, it cannot plausibly claim to be associated with economic, technological and cultural modernity. </p> <p>By contrast, the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, like the skyscrapers of Shanghai, show us how authoritarian capitalism already stakes that claim. In the Bird's Nest stadium, the latest audiovisual hi-tech was placed at the service of a hyper-disciplined collectivist fantasy, made possible by financial resources no democracy would have dared devote to such a purpose. Zhang Yimou, the artistic director of the games ceremonies, said only North Korea could have matched such feats of mass synchronisation.</p> <p>For close to 500 years, modernity has come from the west. The historian Theodore von Laue called this The World Revolution of Westernisation. In 20th-century Europe, liberal democracy faced two powerful versions of modernity that were western but illiberal: fascism and communism. Part of these systems' appeal was precisely that they were modern. (\"I have seen the future and it works,\" said one enthusiast, returning from Moscow.) Liberal democracy finally saw them both off, though not without a world war, a cold war, and a lot of help from the US. </p> <p>In China, we glimpse the prospect of a modernity which is both non-western and illiberal. But is authoritarian capitalism a stable, durable model? That, it seems to me, is among the greatest questions of our time, which is still a post-9/11 time, but also a post-8/8 time, and, ecologically, a five-minutes-to-midnight time.</p> <p>As we of the FLIO think about how to respond to this multiple-front challenge, I have more sympathy than many Europeans do for the notion, canvassed by American policy intellectuals supporting both John McCain and Barack Obama, of a \"concert of democracies\". We should look first to those countries who share our values in the way they govern themselves - and there are more of them now, after these trente glorieuses for liberty. But only with several vital caveats.</p> <p>First, we should not kid ourselves that we can have only liberal democracies as partners. Our values may pull us that way, but our interests will necessarily push us to relationships and even partnerships with currently illiberal states as well. So any institutionalised League of Democracies, arrayed against an Association of Autocrats (Robert Kagan's vivid term), is a seriously bad idea - even assuming you could agree who merits inclusion in the league. Bipolar disorder would be no improvement on multipolar.</p> <p>It's also not the smartest idea to identify this vision of a concert of democracies too emphatically with the west, as in the former French prime minister Edouard Balladur's proposal for what he calls a Western Union. Historically, both modernity and liberalism have come from the west. But the future of freedom now depends on the possibility of new versions of modernity evolving - whether in India, China or the Muslim world, which are distinctly non-western yet also recognisably liberal, in the core sense of cherishing individual freedom. I wouldn't bet on this outcome, but working towards it is the best long-term chance we have. Pessimism of the intellect must be matched by optimism of the will.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">Timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>This isn't going to be easy. Not least since I've just swallowed a shard from a duck bone. Interviewing people in restaurants is always a mistake - they're just about to admit to killing their father or doing something unspeakable to their mother when the meringue arrives - and the Chuen Cheng Ku Chinese restaurant on the edge of London's Soho may be a bigger mistake than most as the waitress speaks hardly any English and I have only the haziest idea what I am eating.</p> <p>But the food writer Elisabeth Luard was keen to get some lunch, so here we are, talking about her new memoir, My Life as a Wife, which scampers through 40 years of marriage to the racy Nicholas Luard, proprietor and saviour of Private Eye in its infancy, co-founder with Peter Cook of the pioneering early 1960s Establishment comedy club, travel writer, novelist, co-founder of the London marathon, conservationist, anti-apartheid campaigner, alcoholic, philanderer and all-round impossible husband. </p> <p>Luard died of cancer in 2004. The book is a portrait of a marriage, and its opening nicely captures the ambiguity of the relationship. \"This is the story of my life as a wife. Or how to stay married for 40 years without actually murdering your husband. A love story.\" The verdict, Luard tells me when I've extracted the duck bone from my throat, could have gone either way.</p> <p>\"It started as the story of a marriage,\" she says, \"and I didn't think it was going to end up like that [as a love letter]. It was basically how to stay married for 40 years without actually murdering the bastard. That was the core of what I embarked on, but writing it was like the truth and reconciliation commission. It really did change. I could suddenly <br>understand why people need to speak about things, because if you speak about them they lose their sharpness.\"</p> <p>Luard was alcohol dependent all his life; extramarital affair dependent, too, if the stories in the book are to be believed. Such as the time, when they were living in Spain, that he managed to give a sexually transmitted disease to both his wife and the au pair. Wasn't she mad to stay with him - except for a year-long separation in the early 1970s when her patience finally ran out - through thick and thin?</p> <p>We never quite get to the heart of this central question. First, she offers negative reasons for sticking around. \"I wanted to say this is how a marriage happens. It's self-evidently not all plain sailing. There's a lot of encouragement now to run for the hills, but there are other considerations. It's a different decision when you have children - and a different decision, too, even when your children are adult, because if you have someone in the kind of physical condition Nicholas was in, your children, if they're well brought up, would pick up the pieces when you walk away.\"</p> <p>When I protest that this sounds more like force of circumstance than grand passion, she changes tack. \"You can sound a bit elitist if you say, 'I loved living with this man who was so literate, so interesting.' I liked the fact that he had a very fine, very educated mind, and after 40 years of marriage we could sit across the table from each other and discuss whatever we wanted. That was great, and that's what I miss with Nicholas. His political ideas were so interesting. You can see that with his career, his conservation work. That ability to see the way we should go, and then get up and do it.\"</p> <p>The truth may be that Luard herself doesn't know what kept them together. \"When a love affair is over,\" she says in the book, \"whatever the reason, the heart and mind keep the print. </p> <p>I can draw no conclusions from the life that we shared. All I can say is that this is what happened at that particular moment, this is how it was, this is how it seemed to me. Some things are left unsaid. We are free to choose what we remember and what we forget.\" There are no definitive portraits of a marriage.</p> <p>The book's title seems self-deprecating for someone who has built a successful career in her own right as an illustrator, food writer and author. Why put herself down in that way? </p> <p>\"I called it that because it's the truth,\" she says. \"My life was completely dictated by the fact that I was a wife, and it's written for all those people who are wives. I used to get asked when I was knee-deep in four children: 'Do you work?'\"</p> <p>Her background was privileged - wealthy mother, airman father killed in the war, diplomat stepfather with whom she didn't get on - but peculiar. She was a debutante in 1959, but quickly saw through the charade. \"I was outraged by the whole business,\" she says, \"which wasn't bad for a 17-year-old. It was like a cattle market. I remember thinking this is not that much different from what goes on in Soho, for heaven's sake. We've both got a price - ours just happens to be higher.\"</p> <p>She was smart but uneducated - this was a time when posh women were meant to be good at entertaining and motherhood, and not much else. Her mother, who was living in Mexico with her diplomat husband, paid Luard's rent, but she had to earn her keep, which is how she came to be working in Private Eye's cramped office above the Establishment club in Greek Street, where she fell in love - more or less at first sight - with her husband-to-be. </p> <p>They married in 1963, had four children in quick succession, and decamped to Spain when the satire bubble burst and Luard's business enterprises foundered. He turned to writing instead, starting with a highly regarded book on Andalucia, but money thereafter was tight and, once her children were bigger, Elisabeth had of necessity to embark on her own career. </p> <p>\"I needed to earn a living,\" she says, \"and I was never not busy.\"</p> <p>She wrote European Peasant Cookery, The Princess and the Pheasant, The Barricaded Larder and The Flavours of Andalucia, and even tried her hand at a novel. Then in 1996, she produced Family Life, a happy book about bringing up her peripatetic family (conceived, she says, as a \"My Family and Other Animals-type memoir, with recipes and drawings\") that ends with a tragedy that played out as she was writing the book - the death from Aids of her eldest daughter Francesca in 1994.</p> <p>Francesca's death is detailed in a moving coda, told from the perspective of both mother and daughter. \"Knowing the inevitable,\" writes Luard, \"she made certain that everyone who knew and loved her understood perfectly what had happened to her - and then she set the matter aside and went about reorganising her life.\" Francesca gave up her job as a journalist on the Daily Mail, where she covered lifestyle subjects, and took up painting instead. \"Life's too short for shopping,\" she told her mother.</p> <p>\"I think she knew who she got it [HIV] from,\" Luard tells me. \"She very bravely rang up the list of exes and said, 'Oi, you'd better go and get yourself tested.' She knew about five, and the sixth said he hadn't picked up the result ... But she had no rancour about it. She was much more worried about who she had passed it on to. She was really remarkable.\"</p> <p>That coda in Family Life also hints at the accommodation she and her husband reached in the painfully bright days they spent nursing their daughter, and afterwards, when they returned to the remote farmhouse in Wales that Nicholas had inherited from his godmother. </p> <p>\"We find,\" she writes - just a few years before Luard was himself diagnosed with cancer - \"that the division of our labours means that we have neither grown apart nor together, but in parallel. Perhaps because of this we still find each other surprising and interesting. Unexpectedly, after three decades of independent living, we can still learn from each other. We know one another's weaknesses and strengths - and, after all these years, take care not to tap too hard on the cracks.\"</p> <p>After lunch, Luard has her photograph taken - a neat touch, this - in the nightclub that now occupies the old Establishment club premises in Greek Street. With a nod to its heritage, it is called Zebrano at the Establishment. Luard, preening for the camera, looks pleased to be back. Then she heads off, ploughing her way through the traffic in Piccadilly Circus and shouting after me: \"The one thing that what you called my privileged upbringing gave me was a belief that everything would be all right. I don't fear anything.\" As if I needed telling. How else could she have survived the successive losses of devoted daughter and errant husband, and still be in love with the world? </p> <p>My Life as a Wife is published by Timewell Press (\u00a316.99).

  "<h2>Dying woman woken from coma to marry</h2> <p>A terminally ill woman was briefly awoken from an induced coma to get married, La Repubblica newspaper reported. It said the 50-year-old nurse asked doctors to help her marry her longtime partner after being diagnosed in July with a terminal strain of hepatitis. Family members donned masks and sterilised clothes to attend the ceremony on Sunday in the northern city of Padua. Doctors brought the woman, who was not identified, to consciousness just long enough to say yes, before she slipped back into the coma, which was induced to relieve pain. She is expected to live for only a few weeks. <br><strong>Associated Press in Rome</strong></p> <h2>Cholera outbreak spreads, leaving two dead</h2> <p>Iraqi officials said the number of people killed by a cholera outbreak had risen to two and that the waterborne disease had infected at least 90 others. A police spokesman in Babil province said 70 new cases had been registered in several provincial towns. An elderly man died from the disease earlier in the week in Babil. Meanwhile, Hassan Tofan, from the Babil provincial council, said 20 additional cholera cases had been registered in the small town of Musayyib. Dr Adil Muhsin, inspector general with the health ministry, said a second person had died from the disease, raising the death toll to two. <br><strong>Associated Press in Baghdad </strong></p> <h2>Police officer shot dead near Russian checkpoint</h2> <p>A Georgian police officer was killed by gunfire near a Russian checkpoint outside South Ossetia yesterday. The death added to tensions as Russian forces continued to occupy Georgian territory weeks after last month's five-day war. The policeman was at a Georgian checkpoint about half a mile from the Russian post, the interior ministry said. A Russian official in South Ossetia said Russian troops at the checkpoint at Karaleti did not open fire. Georgian police said Russian forces had refused to let Georgian investigators through the checkpoint to examine where the gunfire came from. <br><strong>Associated Press in Karaleti</strong></p> <h2>Morales wants US envoy ousted for aiding protests</h2> <p>Bolivian president Evo Morales is calling for the expulsion of the US ambassador for allegedly encouraging anti-government protesters. Morales says he has asked his foreign minister to send a note to the ambassador, Philip Goldberg, asking that he leave the country. Bolivia has been rocked for two weeks by increasingly violent protests led by Morales opponents in the country's more prosperous eastern lowlands. Yesterday, protesters shut a valve, causing a pipeline near the border with Paraguay to explode, resulting in a 10% drop in gas exports to Brazil.<br><strong>Associated Press in LaPaz</strong></p> <h2>Car bomb kills pro-Syria Druze politician</h2> <p>A bomb tore through a car in the hills east of Beirut yesterday, killing a Druze politician from a pro-Syrian party, police said. The bomb that killed Sheik Saleh Aridi, a senior member of the Lebanese Democratic party, was planted in his car in the village of Baissour, police said. It was the first political assassination in about a year in Lebanon and came less than a week before planned reconciliation talks among rival Lebanese factions. Police said six other people were injured. The bomb's target was unusual - previous bombings had largely targeted politicians opposed to Syria's influence in Lebanon. <br><strong>Associated Press in Beirut</strong></p>",
  "<p>Six Greenpeace climate change activists have been cleared of causing \u00a330,000 of criminal damage at a coal-fired power station in a verdict that is expected to embarrass the government and lead to more direct action protests against energy companies.</p> <p>The jury of nine men and three women at Maidstone crown court cleared the six by a majority verdict. Five of the protesters had scaled a 200-metre chimney at Kingsnorth power station, Hoo, Kent, in October last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337506384\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/09/10/GordonChimney.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsnorth chimney\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenpeace activists on the painted chimney October 8 2008. Photograph: Will Rose/Greenpeace</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The activists admitted trying to shut down the station by occupying the smokestack and painting the word \"Gordon\" down the chimney, but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change causing greater damage to property around the world. It was the first case in which preventing property damage caused by climate change had been used as part of a \"lawful excuse\" defence in court. It is now expected to be used more widely by environment groups. </p> <p>In his summing-up at the end of an eight-day trial, the judge, David Caddick, said the case centred on whether or not the protesters had a lawful excuse for their actions. He told the jury that for this defence to be used it had to be proved that the action was due to an immediate need to protect property belonging to another.</p> <p>He said allowance for demonstrations did not extend to breaking the law and the jury's task was to examine the boundary line represented by the lawful excuse and to evaluate whether the defendants had crossed the line. He also warned the jury to put aside any feelings towards Greenpeace, climate change or fuel companies during their deliberations. </p> <p>John Price, prosecuting, had earlier argued that the protesters' actions were \"not capable of being lawful\". He said: \"There are things you can lawfully do in making a protest but there's a line which has to be drawn. When the defendants caused damage to that chimney, it's the line that they crossed.\"</p> <p>The court had heard from Professor Jim Hansen, one of the world's leading climate scientists, that the 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted daily by Kingsnorth could be responsible for the extinction of up to 400 species. Hansen, a Nasa director who advises Al Gore, the former US presidential candidate turned climate change campaigner, told the court that humanity was in \"grave peril\". \"Somebody needs to step forward and say there has to be a moratorium, draw a line in the sand and say no more coal-fired power stations.\"</p> <p>It also heard David Cameron's environment adviser, millionaire environmentalist Zac Goldsmith, and an Inuit leader from Greenland both say climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world. Goldsmith told the court: \"By building a coal-power plant in this country, it makes it very much harder [to exert] pressure on countries like China and India\" to reduce their burgeoning use of the fossil fuel.</p> <p>The court was told that some of the property in immediate need of protection included parts of Kent at risk from rising sea levels, the Pacific island state of Tuvalu and areas of Greenland. The defendants also cited the Arctic ice sheet, China's Yellow River region, the Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica, coastal areas of Bangladesh and the city of New Orleans.</p> <p>The jury was told that Kingsnorth emitted the same amount of carbon dioxide as the 30 least polluting countries in the world combined - and that there were advanced plans to build a new coal-fired power station next to the existing site on the Hoo peninsula.</p> <p>Greenpeace used the court's decision to put pressure on the government to abandon plans for a new generation of coal-fired plants. \"Today's acquittal is a potent challenge to the government's plans for new coal-fired stations from jurors representing ordinary people in Britain who, after hearing the evidence, supported the right to take direct action in order to protect the climate,\" said Ben Stewart, the group's communications director and one of the six acquitted. The others were Will Rose, Kevin Drake, Tim Hewke, Huw Williams and Emily Hall.</p> <p>\"It wasn't only us in the dock, it was coal-fired power generation as well,\" said Hall. \"The only people left in Britain who think new coal is a good idea are business secretary John Hutton and the energy minister Malcolm Wicks. It's time the prime minister stepped in and embraced a clean energy future for Britain.\"</p> <h2>Winning causes</h2> <p>In the last 12 years, court cases involving GM crops and nuclear, chemical and arms companies collapsed after protesters said they had followed their consciences and had been trying to prevent a greater crime.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>2000</strong> Norwich jury found Greenpeace director Lord Melchett and 27 activists not guilty of causing criminal damage to field of GM crops</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>2000</strong> Five Greenpeace volunteers found not guilty of criminal damage after occupying incinerator </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>1999</strong> Three women cleared of causing \u00a380,000 damage to Trident nuclear submarine computer equipment</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>1996</strong> Liverpool jury acquitted four women who caused \u00a31.5m damage to Hawk fighter jet at British Aerospace factory</p>",
  "<p>I never thought I would spend my honeymoon on other people's couches in London, but that's what happened after my husband and I got kicked out of our flat. In three months, our energy bills trebled and so did the prices at our local supermarket. Freelance clients weren't paying, cash flow became non-existent, choices had to be made between eating and paying the rent. We chose eating. Our landlord asked us to leave. What I didn't realise was that we would be entering an emerging group of full-time couch surfers; people who have found a more communal, environmentally friendly, even utopian, way of living.</p> <p>We are not homeless. We have choices. We are not sleeping rough. But, right now, we don't have a fixed address. And, strangely enough, after eight years in the UK, I finally feel settled. Maybe it's my itinerant roots. My grandmother started her career as a migrant worker in the orange groves of Florida. Later, when she had her own farm, there was always an extra person or two sleeping in the shed. And, there have been times over the past 20 years when I have been without an address, for mostly economic reasons. In the late 1980s, when petrol was cheaper than rent, I spent three months driving across America and staying with friends. But this time, it feels more permanent.</p> <p>For the past four weeks, we have been staying with Spencer and Nicola and their two children Oscar and Maud, in London. We live in their lounge, which they have cleared out for us. Most evenings, the six of us pile into Spencer and Nicola's bedroom to watch TV. Maud sometimes practises her cello and Oscar is learning Sweet Child O' Mine on the electric guitar. There is always tea and biscuits, and fresh eggs (the children are rearing two free-range chickens in the back garden). </p> <p>Communal dwellers? Semi-permanent couch surfers? Whatever you call people like us, we are growing in number. We live for free in sheds, spare rooms and lounges, sometimes rotating, sometimes staying for months. We share resources, and pay our hosts in chores and skills. The UK homeless charity Crisis estimates that nearly 400,000 people are classified as hidden homeless, and that this figure will rise to more than a million by 2020. Of these, nearly 150,000 are living in concealed households, that is, staying with family, friends or acquaintances. It is difficult to estimate how many of these people are forced into this situation, but for some it is becoming a lifestyle choice.</p> <p>As a travel phenomenon, couch surfing has exploded over the past two years, with websites such as <a href=\"http://www.couchsurfing.com\">couchsurfing.com</a> that hooks up travellers with locals, who provide free accommodation. An average of 9,000 people per week have signed up to couchsurfing.com since January, and there have been over a half a million successful surfs. Although surfers generally go in for short-term holidays, there are some who just keep moving.</p> <p>\"We have been travelling for two and a half years now,\" says Alex Kiriak, who classifies herself as a nomadic and semi-permanent couch surfer. Lara Cappelletti has been house-free for more than five years. \"Giving up a permanent address releases you from an enormous amount of responsibility, and paves the way for a more simple, stress-free life,\" she says. \"For more than two years now, strangers have opened the doors to their homes and this lifestyle has changed me for ever.\"</p> <p>Another semi-permanent free-housing situation that has been around since the early 1970s is Wwoof-ing. Formerly an acronym for Working Weekends on Organic Farms, it now stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, and is a programme administered by Lili (Low-Impact Living Initiative) in Buckinghamshire. Farmers offer free accommodation and food in exchange for your helping hands. \"There are people out there who Wwoof pretty much permanently,\" says Scarlett Penn, contracts manager. \"Some of them stay with one host for a long period and become part of the furniture, while others move around more regularly, picking up knowledge and experience along the way.\" She believes there are significantly more Wwoof-ers than this time last year: \"About 50% more.\"</p> <p>Ben (not his real name)*, 36, an artist from Manchester, has been couch surfing for two years. He helped his first \"host family\" de-clutter their three-bedroom south London home, and managed the redesign of their loft space. \"I coordinated with the builders and acted as project manager. At the same time, I was able to work on projects of my own that I couldn't have done if I was working to pay the rent. The two guys I lived with travelled a lot with their work and didn't have that kind of flexibility.\" Ben got free <br>accommodation and his hosts increased the value of their house with his help. </p> <p>Now he is living with a long-time friend, who has just had her second child and is about to return to work. Her husband works full-time, so Ben will help with the childcare. \"The dynamic of three adults is 10 times more useful than that of two, especially if kids are involved,\" he says. He also stresses the environmental benefits of communal living. \"Do we really need that much space? I share a lot of resources with my friend's family: the car, petrol, insurance, energy and food.\" </p> <p>Ben thinks the trend will continue as the housing market slumps, and people become more concerned about the environment. \"Maybe this is the new social housing. Instead of the council putting you up, it's your friends. And if you can find non-monetary ways to pay them back - that works for everybody.\"</p> <p>As for the host families, Nicola says they get a lot out of having people stay. \"It helps the children to be open-minded and prepares them for the world out there,\" she says. She doesn't like British attitudes towards owning property. \"We are a community, we should have people coming into our houses. It creates memories and shared experiences.\" </p> <p>Next month we are moving to New Orleans and we have already set up the first two months of surfing. There is an ideology forming here: of freedom and mobility. Less impact on the environment through shared resources. Less impact on the bank account. Helping each other. A bit hippy perhaps, but with rising living costs and a rapidly changing climate, maybe it's time for that again.</p> <p>* This article was amended on Thursday September 11 2008.

  "<p>The Home Office is abandoning a programme to accommodate children and their families outside immigration detention centres, it emerged last night.</p> <p>Millbank, a former old people's home in Ashford, Kent, was converted into a home for asylum-seeker families as part of an \"alternative to detention\" government pilot last year. </p> <p>The project was aimed at keeping children in local schools while encouraging their families - who have exhausted their asylum appeals - to voluntarily return home. </p> <p>However, the Guardian has learned that after almost a year in operation - during which it was supposed to accommodate up to 170 people a day - Millbank is empty. </p> <p>The centre, which was expected to process 240 families over the year, accommodated only 13. Of those, just one family were persuaded to voluntarily return to their country of origin. </p> <p>It is expected the complex of bedrooms, kitchen facilities and recreational areas will be shut down in the next month.</p> <p>Damian Green, the shadow immigration minister, in whose constituency Millbank is based, described the closure as \"a serious blow\" for the government. \"Many people, including me, were hoping that there was an alternative to locking up children in detention centres. Ministers appear to have given up.\"</p> <p>Green will ask ministers for a full explanation and a breakdown of lost funding.</p> <p>Roy Millard, deputy chief executive of the charity Migrant Helpline, which was given a grant by the Home Office to run the project, said \"communication failure\" had led to barely a trickle of families being referred to the facility.</p> <p>\"We believed that we produced a high-quality service,\" he said. \"But the model was not adequately tested because we were not sent enough families to test it. That was a real disappointment.\"</p> <p>The government is facing mounting criticism of its policy of detaining hundreds of children in facilities such as Yarls Wood immigration removal centre. Sir Al Aynsley-Green, children's commissioner for England, said: \"My concern is that the government has never wholeheartedly explored community supervision as an alternative to detaining families, and to create a dialogue to convince asylum seekers to return to their country on a voluntarily basis.\"</p> <p>A UK Border Agency spokesman said: \"We're currently working with children's charities to find alternatives to the detention of children. </p> <p>\"We will evaluate the success of these pilots, and use the findings to inform our approach on this emotive subject.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday September 12 2008.

  "<p>Without us accepting those who fled in the 1930s from Nazi Germany we would be very much the poorer (Welcome to Britain - so long that as you're an engineer, maths teacher or sheep shearer, September 10). Many of the physicists who came, such as Max Born, Arthur Beer, Werner Ehrenberg, Otto Frisch and Leo Szilard have provided a legacy that has dominated world science and has provided much of the foundations on which the Cern project is based. Of the scientists who fled to the UK in the 1930s, 18 subsequently won a Nobel prize. It is imperative that new rules on migration do not restrict academics entering the UK and, where they are escaping persecution, obtaining refugee status. <br><strong>Professor John Akker</strong><br>Council for Assisting Refugee Academics </p> <p>Even the government agrees there is a shortage of midwives. The birthrate is rising sharply and almost half of all midwives are set to retire in the next decade. There is certainly no shortage of people in the country wanting to train and work as midwives, or return to midwifery after spending time out of the profession. The problem is that there is a shortage of funds to train these men and women and give them jobs at the end of it. So steps to limit any potential sources of recruitment into the profession, without a concerted effort to recruit and train more midwives, means we will continue to have a midwife shortage. <br><strong>Karlene Davis</strong><br>Royal College of Midwives </p> <p>The announcement that employers will now not be able to look beyond Europe to recruit doctors, social workers and carers is absurd, with the UK's elderly having to bear the brunt of this decision. At Nightingale, the largest care home in the UK, we already find it very difficult to recruit the right people to look after our 250 residents. Of 100 applications, it is not uncommon to find only one person suitable to work with us. These new migrant rules are only going to make it more difficult for care homes which struggle under the current funding system to find staff and ensure residents are well cared for. The negative perception of care work is one of the reasons we have needed to recruit from overseas. Unless its status is elevated this country's elderly are going to suffer a huge shortage of high-standard care. <br><strong>Leon Smith</strong><br>Chief executive, Nightingale </p> <p>We welcome the new rules on recruiting from outside the EU which stop the recruitment of doctors. This should stop the brain drain from the developing countries whose people need them. But to exclude social workers could have an adverse effect and restrictions on recruiting chefs may help beef and Yorkshire pudding to replace Chicken Tikka Masala as the most popular Sunday meal.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Evening all. This is a big one for Scotland. Defeat in Skopje has left their World Cup hopes if not dangling from a thread, then at least hanging from an unsuitably thin piece of rope. Iceland are tonight's opponents, so will Scotland be leaving Reykjavik feeling <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=38UrRpYsPjw\">like this</a> or feeling a little more <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=PDxMQaMqsig\">like this</a>?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Geography dept.</strong> This is <a href=\"http://blogme.dium.com/files/countries_europe_map.jpg\">just about as close as Iceland get to a local derby</a>, other than their skirmishes with the Faroes. The Icelanders are an odd team. The 2-2 draw in Norway on Saturday wasn't a bad result by any means (and an ideal one for Scotland), but it offers little insight into their prospects tonight. Take their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign: they beat Northern Ireland twice and were four minutes from beating the eventual champions Spain, before Iniesta's late equaliser rescued a 1-1 draw in Reykjavik. But they also conceded eight goals in two games against Latvia, failed to beat Liechtenstein at home and got hammered 3-0 by the minnows in Vaduz. So Scotland can rest assured they're not the only team in Group Nine with a Jekyll and Hyde record.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Team news</strong> <br><strong>Iceland:</strong> Sturluson, Birkir Mar Saevarsson, Eiriksson,<br>Kristjan Orn Sigurdsson, Gunnarsson, Steinsson, Hreidarsson,<br>Gislason, Gudjohnsen, Helguson, Hallfredsson. Subs: Torgeirsson,<br>Indridi Sigurdsson, Ragnar Sigurdsson, Palmason, Gunnarson,<br>Thordarson, Thorvaldsson.<br><strong>Scotland:</strong> Gordon, Broadfoot, Naysmith, McManus, Caldwell,<br>Brown, Darren Fletcher, Maloney, McFadden, Robson, Commons.<br>Subs: McGregor, Alexander, Miller, Boyd, Hartley,<br>Steven Fletcher, Berra.<br><strong>Referee:</strong> Serge Gumienny (Belgium)</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>A few notes on the Iceland side:</strong> There's plenty of quality in there - Eidur Gudjohnsen, Hermann Hreidarsson, Greitar Steinsson and Heidar Helguson are well known to followers of the Premier League, Stefan Gislason is captain of Brondby, Emil Hallfredsson plays in Serie A with Reggina and young Aron Gunnarsson was exceptional at full-back when I saw him at Coventry earlier this season, though he's likely to play in midfield tonight. Scotland might be able to exploit their <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/people/Birkir_Saevarsson/1197542593\">height advantage over full-back Birkir Saevarsson</a>.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Email dept.</strong> Here's Kjartan Kjartansson, whose name somewhat gives away his allegiance: \"Although I may be slightly impartial, I think Iceland have a fair chance of winning this match. Have just come off drawing away against our old foes the Norwegians and have a fully fit Gudjohnsen for the first time in ages and we're playing at home. If the Scots are going to underestimate us they might, much like the group of drunken Scotsmen I saw mooning a female reporter on public television last night, be setting themselves up for a hiding ...\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Anthemwatch:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.musik.is/Lof/E/lofe.html\">Iceland's song</a> is delivered beautifully by a lady in a woolly hat. Doesn't sound like a national anthem, nothing bombastic about it at all - lovely. O Flower of Scotland is delivered by the same singer, but she's nearly drowned out by the travelling Tartan Army. Cracking stuff all round I'd say. Hairs standing to attention.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Peep!</strong> We are off! Scotland, playing in their white away kit with the ice-blue cross on the chest, kick off.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Early free-kick to the Scots, Shaun Maloney bundled over on the left. Robson delivers well, but an Icelandic head nods it away.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Hreidarsson spanks in a shot but it pings away off a Scotland defender. Somebody has brought their bagpipes. Oh good.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Hallfredsson wins a corner ...</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> ... which drops terrifyingly in the six-yard box. Gudjohnsen's a couple of yards away, but the defence scramble clear.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Some nice pass, pass, pass from Scotland, but Naismith pings the ball aimlessly through to Sturluson in the Iceland goal to bring an end to proceedings.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> It's Robson and Maloney stick at the moment. Gunnarsson hacks down Maloney, which leads to a free-kick, which leads to a corner, which leads to a clearance.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Rather distractingly someone's parked a couple of hatchbacks just the other side of the advertising hoardings on the far touchline. Makes it look like they're playing on a scrap of land in front of a down-on-its-luck car showroom.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Superb break from Gunnarsson, with support from Saevarsson, down the right. He cuts inside but his final ball is somewhere between a cross and a shot and Gordon punches clear.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Broadfoot, making his Scotland debut, is booked for bringing down Eiriksson. Well, I say 'bringing down', actually I mean 'kicking up'.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Throw-in to Iceland and Gunnarsson wangs it in flat and hard. It's cleared back out to the midfielder, who skips past Robson and picks out Helguson but the striker's header slides wide. That was half a chance.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> This is frenetic stuff. Commons wins a free-kick on the edge of the Iceland area and Maloney's cross is nodded away.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Iceland immediately break, the ball finds its way to Gudjohnsen, who should score but volleys over. Down the other end again and it's a corner to Scotland ...</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Iceland 0-1 Scotland (Broadfoot 18)</strong> ... whipped in by Robson, Broadfoot gets the run on his marker and powers his header home. That'll settle a few nerves.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> By the way, a crash caused by my embedding a Bjork video into the article (what better reason is there?) means there's two versions of this MBM. If you're in the wrong one, you won't be getting any updates so things will seem rather quiet. I suppose if you're in the wrong one you won't be reading this explanation either, so it's not great news for you. Another long throw zooms in but Scotland clear</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Gudjohnsen <em>just</em> fails to get on the end of a lovely dinked pass from Eiriksson. \"I find it a bit disappointing that Terry Venables has never managed Iceland,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"After all, he's a geyser who is full of hot air and can't stop spouting off.\" Bom tish!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Fletcher seems under no pressure in midfield but slips and suddenly Iceland are on the attack. Helguson criminally wastes the position with a weak, weak shot.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Scotland have cleverly turned down the heat a touch here, a boring 20 minutes up to half-time will suit them just fine. In more exciting news, Finland are 3-2 up on Germany in Group Four - for details on that game and the rest of tonight's qualifiers use our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/matches\">Live Score service</a>.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Broadfoot gets round the back, but his cross is plucked from the air by Sturluson.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Gudjohnsen gets a whack. Gudjohnsen goes down clutching his noggin. Iceland kick the ball out of play. Gudjohnsen gets up. A little bit of me dies inside.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> There's still something shambolic about the Scottish defence - Gudjohnsen picks up the ball with his back to goal, but McManus panics so much as he scrambles to get tight that he ends up going AOT and landing on his backside. The striker gets crowded out eventually, but Scotland will be looking for a little more calm leadership from their skipper.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Maloney drills in a low cross, which Sigurdsson gets to just ahead of McFadden. Scotland have been impressive going forward - and seconds later McFadden gets behind the back four once again, though his cross dribbles harmlessly away.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Robson booked for - wait for it - kicking the ball away. Clap. Clap. Clap</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>40 min: </strong> Commons gets to the byline, McFadden cuts to the near post and he deflects the cross into the defender for a corner. Robson then almost catches out the keeper with a shot to the near post.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> McManus makes a crucial stop on the line! Awful defending from Broadfoot allows Hallfredsson to nick the ball and swing a cross in, Helguson nods down and Gislason - I think - thighs the ball towards goal. The Scottish captain is fortunately there to make the block.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Iceland try to pass their way out of trouble but only succeed in giving away possession. Maloney tries to junk his way into the box, but a defender gets a foot in.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Peep, peep, peep!</strong> And that's half-time. Not a bad game - not a great deal of quality and two defences attempting to outdo each other for incompetence, but some decent attacking football from both sides to exploit their opponents weakness. There's definitely more goals in this, that's for sure.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Half-time hot drink update:</strong> Soya milk. Nothing in the fridge but soya milk. I did dabble in a bit of the old soya in my youth, but I've long since gne back to the proper cow's stuff, which, in a nutshell, means black coffee for me this evening. Very disappointing.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Something that annoys me dept.</strong> Adverts with actors pretending to be members of the public. \"I've been drinking YogTasty for three weeks and I feel far less bloated. I've got my life back!\" Why? Because they treat everybody who watches them like an idiot. They're utterly, utterly insulting. Rant over.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Something else that annoys me dept.</strong> Bits of yesterday's fish supper stuck in the gaps between my teeth. Why? One word: Gumdisease.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Peep!</strong> Back to the action, which has been anything but annoying thus far. Indridi Sigurdsson has replaced Bjarni Eiriksson for the hosts.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> More oh-so-average defending gives Iceland a corner first up ...</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> ... which ends abruptly as the referee blows for a foul on Craig Gordon.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Saevarsson gets behind Naysmith, crosses, Caldwell clears for another corner. And now another as Gordon tips a looping shot over the bar ...</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> ... nodded away, but only for a throw-in which for Iceland is almost as good as a corner. The ball drops to Gudjohnsen on the edge of the area, but he skews his shot well wide.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Scotland finally gain a foothold and string a few passes together. McFadden's been quiet tonight, but Maloney, Commons and Robson have all played well. Still, they're second best in this half so far.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Good work from Gunnarsson and Hallfredsson, comfortably Iceland's best players so far tonight, brings the hosts a free-kick but it's wasted. Scotland's set-pieces have certainly been the better of the two sides - and that's contributed a great deal to the scoreline.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> \"George Bush is my president and Boris Johnson is your mayor. Those commercials you rant against treat everyone like idiots because they are,\" offers Daniel Vergara, somewhat controversially.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> PENALTY TO SCOTLAND! Kristjan Sigurdsson comes straight through the back of McFadden. Stonewall ...</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Iceland 0-2 Scotland (Robson 59)</strong> ... McFadden picks himself up to take it ... SAVED! But the ball drops kindly and three white-shirted players are there to poke in the rebound. Robson claims it, McFadden - face like thunder - claims it. It looks to me like the midfielder just beat him to it.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Nope, just seen the replay and it was McFadden who got his toe there first. Robson probably should have left him to it - they were perhaps a little fortunate not to make an embarassing mess of that.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Commons makes way for Kenny Miller, a player I've seen live (as in from the stands), ooh, four or five times and has never played well. The wonderfully-named Palmi Palmason comes on for Iceland to replace Gunnarsson.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Loose touch from Helguson - goal kick. Palmason, by the way, looks a little like a young Jon Harley.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Ever heard 'When The Saints Go Marching In' played on the bagpipes? I just have. Iceland look very dispirited now.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Gudjohnsen splits the Scottish defence with a pass to Steinsson, who seems finally to have got on top of the livewire Maloney, but his cross is straight into the arms of Gordon.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Hairy moment for Gordon as he flails at a cross and his centre half nods out for a corner. Gislason, a former Arsenal trainee, shows why he's no longer at the Emirates by pinging the corner out for a throw-in.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> There's a chant coming from one portion of the terrace that sounds like \"Armavista!\" [Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap] \"Armavista!\" Can any Icelandic/Scottish speakers shed any light?</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Fantastic stuff from Maloney down the left, Robson pulls the ball in and it just evades McFadden in the box. Corner to Scotland ...</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> ... Robson, with unerring accuracy, picks out the chest of Kjartan Sturluson in the Iceland goal.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> RED CARD! More intelligent captaincy from McManus, diving with his hand to prevent Helguson from heading at goal. Idiotic. Penatly to Iceland ...</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Iceland 1-2 Scotland (Gudjohnsen 76):</strong> ... tucked confidently home by the former Chelsea man, sending Gordon the wrong way. It's McManus's birthday today - his 26th. From the look of some of his defending, he's had too much jelly, ice cream and orange juice, and got a little over-excited. Could be a nervy last 15 for the Scots.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Calm stuff from Fletcher, who has taken the armband from McManus, as three attackers homed in on him on the edge of his own box.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Thanks to Orn and \u00d3li Juliusson who write to tell us: 'Armavista' is 'Afram Island' meaning 'onward Iceland' or 'Go Iceland!' It's worked a treat too.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Kenny Miller, who's done nothing to change my not-particularly-high opinion of him, gets caught offside unnecessarily. Naismith hammers clear. Iceland probe. It's all a bit tense.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Gordon wins a free-kick for (I swear) flicking his leg out like a jinking winger does to win a penalty, as Helguson closes in on a through ball.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Booo! Booo! Whistle! Jeer! Scotland are taking their sweet time with a free-kick, much to the annoyance of the home faithful.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Gudjohnsen appeals for a hand-ball on the edge of the area as Broadfoot makes a tackle, but nothing doing from the Belgian referee.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Hallfredsson lifts a cross out of play with several team-mates well placed in the middle. Tick, tick, tick ...</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Somehow Scotland escape! Mistake from Graham Alexander in the full-back position, Hallfredsson pulls back, and Helguson's shot is bound for the back of the net before Gary Caldwell gets his head in the way. He doesn't know much about it, but it's effective enough. Three minutes injury time to play.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Gislason punts forward, Helguson caught offside. Is that the last chance?</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peeeep!</strong> Yes it is! Scotland keep their World Cup hopes alive. Just.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>It's a giant step</strong> towards the runners-up spot in Group Nine, which, let's be honest, is pretty much the best Scotland can hope for. Defensively they were very average indeed, but going forward Burley's side definitely have something about them - if only they had (and I mean this) a big Emile Heskey-type striker. Thanks for reading folks. See you again soon. Cheerio!</p>",
  "<p>Jerome Corsi, PhD is the Lord High Admiral of the Swift-boat Armada now <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/us/politics/13book.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">heading against Barack Obama</a>. Still doing the hornpipe over his success sinking John Kerry, since his book Unfit for Command, plus a few million in conservative foundation dollars helped torpedo the Democratic candidate below the water-line even before he noticed, Corsi has now launched <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Obama-Nation-Leftist-Politics-Personality/dp/1416598065/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220977645&amp;sr=8-1\">Obama Nation</a> into the New York Times bestseller lists.<br> Generally only dubious scientists, quack doctors and freaky cosmologists dress themselves in a little brief acronymic authority by putting their titles after their name on the cover of books. Corsi repeats his (apparently genuine) PhD on every single verso page heading.</p> <p>Nor does the bestseller list mean best read, as the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/books/bestseller/besthardnonfiction.html\">far-too-discreet little dagger</a> next to Obama Nation and several other current conservative hatchet jobs indicates. It means that there have been bulk purchases from bookshops. If a foundation wants to give away free books, it can get a bulk wholesale rate directly from the publishers. Paying retail for bulk buys is more expensive, but it's an effective way to puff them onto the bestseller list.<br> Even so, I do appreciate writers like <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fact-or-fiction-the-incredible-world-of-kitty-kelley-428539.html\">Kitty Kelly</a>, when they scrutinise the toe-jam on the clay feet of the great, good and royal, so I tried to appreciate Corsi's opus as an example of that genre. Obama is not perfect, after all, and it always helps to temper optimism with realism.<br> However, I almost gave up reading during the introduction, when Corsi referred to his extensive \"footnoting all references so readers can determine for themselves the truth and validity of the factual claims.\" Truth and validity, a tautology, elides into an oxymoron: fact and claims are different animals outside the faith-based universe. He refers to Obama's \"pattern of voting on the far left on a wide range of policy issues,\" which is only true if you consider Margaret Thatcher to be a charter member of the Weathermen. Even more risibly, Corsi suggests that Obama would \"lead the United States in a costly and self-destructive direction, both at home and abroad. \u2026 We would be a militarily weakened and economically diminished nation\". Presumably, a less faith-based Corsi might note that his hypothetical state of the nation under Obama is the actual state after two terms of George Bush. Corsi avers: \"Growing numbers of largely Hispanic illegal immigrants, many of them still citizens of their home countries \u2026 live in our midst with no firm purpose or requirement to become American citizens.\" I suspect that most of them are unaware that US passports are on offer. This is the voice of prejudice that in one breath condemns immigrants for both taking our jobs while living on welfare!</p> <p>Corsi expands his almost limitless ability to have his cake and eat it when he cites Wall Street Journal and Fox consultant John Fund, who complains that Obama beat Alan Keyes, an \"unserious\" GOP candidate, to get in the Senate. This is true, but Keyes and Corsi himself were recently trying to get the <a href=\"http://www.constitutionparty.com/\">Constitution party</a> <a href=\"http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=55735\">nomination for the presidency</a>. Unseriousness is clearly contagious.</p> <p>On the other hand, Corsi is not always completely wrong. His analysis of Hillary Clinton's mistake in <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/05092008/news/nationalnews/hill_drops_a_racial_bomb_110095.htm\">using the race card</a> is quite accurate, even though his claim that her \"campaign attacks against Barack Obama legitimised many of the lines of inquiry explored in the first two sections of this book,\" is a stretch. Her campaign no more justifies his \"lines of inquiry\" than his book retrospectively koshers her cynical use of the race card.</p> <p>Occasionally Corsi asks legitimate questions, but he consistently refuses to accept legitimate answers, and it would appear that his sole purpose in examining some of the weirder myths of the blogosphere is to keep them afloat. For example, he says magnanimously: \"I accept Obama's statement that he is a Christian, but take exception to the claim that Obama was not introduced to Islam as a child.\" But who made that claim? Obama's team said that he had never been a Muslim, not that he not been \"introduced to Islam\" the same way that I was \"introduced to Anglicanism\" when dragooned to Church for the school Founder's Day service.<br> With spurious academic authority he declares: \"We have already established that Obama wrote the autobiography to hide key points.\" Oh no, we haven't. Obama's books probably do suffer from overhyping, but he was explicit that these are not autobiographical chronicles. So when Obama says he used marijuana, it does not earn him brownie points for being unevasively un-Clintonian, or indeed un-Bushian. Rather it is a cynical political prophylactic against the chance of him being revealed. Corsi joined in hounding Obama to disown the Rev Jeremiah Wright, then attacking his disloyalty to his old mentor when he did. McCarthy meets Kevin Bacon, as acquaintances of acquaintances are marshalled and alleged to be communist or Muslim, in that modern form of conservative colour-blindness where red and green are indistinguishable. People like Saul Alinsky (the guru of community organisers) died never meeting Obama. But some people he knew did, and so \u2026 . Perhaps most bizarre, if you are not attuned to the conservative evangelical fixation on Kenya, is Corsi's depiction of Obama's involvement there. For the rest of the world, an authoritarian tribalist government fixed an election but was forced to compromise with the democratic winner in the face of riots. To the evangelical right, despite <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10415208\">\"credible signs of electoral fraud\"</a> Kenyan President Kibaki is a hero, not to be overthrown by the mere casting of ballots.<br> In Corsi's narrative, Obama's Luo tribal paternity led him to intervene on behalf of a \"communist\" (incidentally Anglican) Odinga, who was furthermore a Muslim stooge pledged to introduce Sharia law in an overwhelmingly Christian country. Obama \"could claim to be a Kenyan citizen\" \u2013 the same way, presumably that McCain could claim to a Panamian citizenship or the Clintons and Kennedys Irish, or indeed any Jewish politician could claim Israeli citizenship. It is typical of Corsi's use of sources that he quotes Mainu Wararu, \"respected international correspondent\", on the fears that Kikuyu have about Obama in the White House. However he skips Waruru's conclusion: \"This attitude is running counter to views of majority of Kenyans who are excited by every victory by the US democrat frontrunner and are praying day and night for more victories for this <a href=\"http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/16948\">'son of Kenya'</a>.\"<br> Incidentally, applying his own methodology that every accusation is true unless definitively disproven, I checked with Notre Dame professor <a href=\"http://www.nd.edu/~dmyers/\">Daniel Myers</a>, the custodian of the archives of the Lemberg Centre for the Study of Violence, which Corsi claims to have worked with. There is no record of his presence there. Of course, this does not prove that he wasn't \u2013 but he does not give his victim the same indulgence.<br> Corsi's smearing of fact, supposition and slander into a quantum slime really made me wish I had worn rubber gloves when reading. Nonetheless, Obama and his team should really read this book, even if it seems like turning over a stone to study the things that scurry from underneath. They do not need an enigma machine to plot the enemy fleet's manoeuvres. It's all here.</p>",
  "<p>This year will see the second-biggest loss on record of Arctic sea ice - a sign that the area of ice coverage is shrinking at a pace faster than once expected.</p> <p>The trend also suggests that global warming is likely to increase, polar bear habitat will decline, and previously icebound areas could be opened to oil and gas exploration.</p> <p>Mark Serreze, a senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, said yesterday that the sea-ice minimum, which will be reached later this month, won't hit last year's record because the amount of daylight is decreasing in the Arctic and a new freeze is beginning.</p> <p>But the minimum amount of ice at summer's end this year will be near last year's total. In 2007, the extent of Arctic ice was 23% lower than the previous record in 2005. </p> <p>That 2007 total, which set a record, was 1.65m square miles. As of Monday, satellite observations showed 1.78m square miles.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice is important because it reflects most sunlight, keeping polar regions cool and producing a cooling effect at lower latitudes. Open water, in contrast, absorbs the sun's energy, and the warm ocean waters mean more ice melting, the National Snow and Ice Data Centre says.</p> <p>If ice is lost, more sun is absorbed, and heat from the ocean is released back to the atmosphere, Serreze said.<br>The understanding of the impacts of these changes is still in its infancy, Serreze said.</p> <p>The centre's measurements show the ice has declined dramatically during the past 30 years.</p> <p>\"The real issue is, what's the long-term trend - and it's negative,\" Serreze said. He said summer could be ice-free in the Arctic by 2030. Some scientists give it just another decade.</p> <p>Two years of extreme ice minimums indicate that the low in 2007 wasn't random, said James Overland, a scientist who researches the Arctic climate at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p> <p>The cause of the ice loss is a combination of global warming from an increase of greenhouse gases and natural variations - winds that brought warm temperatures and blew ice to the Atlantic side, Overland said. If the cause was global warming alone, most scientists thought they wouldn't see this kind of ice loss for 30 years, he said.</p> <p>This summer conditions were more normal in the Arctic, but the ice was thinner to begin with.</p> <p>\"The question was, would the new ice last through the summer - and it did not,\" Overland said.</p> <p>The relationship between ice and ocean conditions will make it hard for sea ice to return to what it was before, he said. Instead, the long-term trend will be decline in ice cover.</p> <p>Two years ago, scientists didn't foresee major sea ice loss until 2050, but because of a combination of factors, \"we're on a fast track\", Overland said.</p> <p>Ignatius G Rigor, a scientist who researches Arctic sea ice and the atmosphere at the Polar Ice Centre at the University of Washington, said he still thinks there's a chance this year's minimum will hit a new low.</p> <p>Rigor said greenhouse gases from fossil fuels are changing the climate, bringing warmer temperatures and changes in weather patterns over the long term.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice is far below the average in the 1980s and before, and has been declining since about the 1970s, Rigor said. The ice retreat coincides with increasing temperatures around the globe.</p> <p>Like Overland, Rigor said the changes in Arctic sea ice are from a combination of global warming and natural changes - winds, high pressure and higher temperatures. The bottom line, he said, is that temperatures are important, but variations in wind are also part of the equation.</p> <p>Overland was one of the government scientists who determined that the polar bear should be listed as an endangered species because global warming would reduce sea ice by 2050.</p> <p>In the past two years, polar bears north of Alaska and Siberia have had \"a very difficult time\", and that will continue for the foreseeable future, he said.</p> <p>Sea ice habitat will decline to 20% of what it was 20 years ago, Overland said. When that will happen isn't known, but 2030 is a reasonable projection, he added.</p> <p>Overland also said that declining ice also speeds up the prospects of oil exploration in northern Alaska, Canada and Siberia.</p>",
  "<p>Six Greenpeace climate change activists have been cleared of causing criminal damage at a coal-fired power station in a verdict that is expected to embarrass the government and strengthen the anti-coal movement. </p> <p>The jury of nine men and three women at Maidstone crown court cleared the six, five of whom had scaled a 200m tall chimney at Kingsnorth power station at Hoo, Kent in October 2007.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337487235\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/09/10/GordonChimney.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsnorth chimney\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenpeace activists on the painted chimney. Photograph: Will Rose/Greenpeace</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The activists admitted trying to shut down the station by occupying the smokestack and painting the world \"Gordon\" down the chimney, but argued that they were legally justified because they were trying to prevent climate change causing greater damage to property around the world.</p> <p>It was the first case where preventing property damage caused by climate change has been used as part of a \"lawful excuse\" defence in court. It is now expected to be used widely by environment groups. </p> <p>The court had heard from Prof James Hansen, one of the world's leading climate scientists, that the 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted daily by Kingsnorth could be responsible for the extinction of up to 400 species. </p> <p>Hansen, a Nasa director who advises Al Gore, told the court that humanity was in \"grave peril\". </p> <p>He said: \"Somebody needs to step forward and say there has to be a moratorium, draw a line in the sand and say no more coal-fired power stations.\"</p> <p>It also heard David Cameron's environment adviser, millionaire environmentalist Zac Goldsmith, and an Inuit leader from Greenland say that climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world.</p> <p>The court was told was that some of the property in immediate need of protection included parts of Kent at risk from rising sea levels, the Pacific island state of Tuvalu and areas of Greenland. </p> <p>The defendants also cited the Arctic ice sheet, China's Yellow river region, the Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica, coastal areas of Bangladesh and the city of New Orleans.</p> <p>Goldsmith told the court: \"By building a coal-power plant in this country, it makes it very much harder in exerting pressure on countries like China and India to reduce their burgeoning use of the fossil fuel.\"</p> <p>The jury was told that Kingsnorth emits the same amount of CO2 as the 30 least polluting countries in the world combined \u2013 and that there are advanced plans to build a new coal-fired power station next to the existing site on the Hoo Peninsula in Kent.</p> <p>Greenpeace used the court's decision to pile pressure on government to abandon plans for a new generation of coal-fired plants. </p> <p>\"Today's acquittal is a potent challenge to the government's plans for new coal-fired stations from jurors representing ordinary people in Britain who, after hearing the evidence, supported the right to take direct action in order to protect the climate,\" said Ben Stewart, Greenpeace's communications director who was one of the six acquitted. </p> <p>The others were Will Rose, Kevin Drake, Tim Hewke, Huw Williams and Emily Hall.</p> <p>\"It wasn't only us in the dock, it was coal-fired power generation as well. The only people left in Britain who think new coal is a good idea are business secretary John Hutton and the energy minister Malcolm Wicks,\" said Hall. </p> <p>\"It's time the prime minister stepped in and embraced a clean energy future for Britain.\"</p>",
  "<p>I know the last thing we need right now is another North American election to worry about. Just as the coverage of the US election reaches saturation point in Europe, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7602864.stm\">announced</a> that Canada will go to the polls on October 14, in an attempt by Harper to increase the ruling conservative party's position to a majority government. And we should be worried.</p> <p>The US election obviously matters to Europeans - the last eight years have shown us how much of a stake the rest of us have in who America chooses as its next leader on November 4. What we might forget, in the next two months of North American election campaigning, is how much the Canadian election matters too.</p> <p>The lack of interest abroad in Canada's national politics is striking - probably partly a perennial stereotype of Canada as peaceful (read: boring) country, partly because the last eight years have required a heightened focus on the big bag of crazy that the institutional politics of Canada's southern neighbour has become. No one has benefited from this more than <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/harper_stephen/\">Harper</a>: outside of Canada, there's barely been a mention of the fact that even calling this election is a violation of his earlier electoral promise to set fixed election dates, to stop politicians calling elections whenever they're in a favourable position in the polls (can you guess why Harper called the election now?).</p> <p>In Britain we seem to be inured to how bizarre and undemocratic it is for leaders to be able to pick an election date. Harper's outright flip-flopping on the issue makes the whole problem transparent - and, sure enough, the likely outcome of the October election will be a majority Conservative government in Canada.</p> <p>The broken pledge on fixed elections is just the latest dubious act from Harper, a man who has dismissed the Kyoto Protocol as a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/01/30/harper-kyoto.html\">\"socialist\" enterprise</a> with no purpose other than to punish rich nations, acquiesced to George Bush's war on terror, culled funding for <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061004/tories_women_061004/20061004?hub=Politics\">women's advocacy programmes</a> and accepted same-sex marriages only after members of his own party <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061207/samesexmarriage_vote_061207/20061207?hub=TopStories\">voted against him</a> on a motion to \"restore the traditional definition of marriage\". For a prime minister with a powerless minority government, he's managed to do an almost impressive amount of damage since coming to power two years ago, damage that - particularly on environmental issues - has an impact far beyond Canada.</p> <p>Some have argued that, even if you don't like Harper, a majority government of any kind is better than the current gridlock. Others have argued that it doesn't matter - that, being \"right or left wing in Canadian politics has come to mean as little as being left- or right-handed for a tennis serve\", that the main parties <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20060206_121010_121010\">compete for the centre</a>. But this ignores how odious Harper could be when no longer reined in by his enfeebled parliamentary position.</p> <p>If you care about the American election because you're scared of Sarah Palin's scepticism toward global warming, you should worry about Harper's unwillingness to continue his predecessor's work against climate change. If you hated George Bush because of his government's corrosion of civil liberties at home and abroad, the fact that Harper has been a thorough Bush apologist is a worrying indicator of how a full-fledged Conservative government would encroach on the rights of Canadians.</p> <p>Although Harper's agenda in the event of a majority government is still unclear, his record is a worrying indicator of the way things will go: to the list of anti-gay rights, anti-women and anti-environmental positions, we can add legislative changes giving Canada's immigration department unprecedented powers to reject immigration applications, as well as setting back truly universal childcare plans in favour of <a href=\"http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060502/budget_childcare_060502?s_name=&amp;no_ads=\">childcare \"allowances\"</a>. His foreign policy record is more of a question mark, but during the minority government Harper extended the pledge of Canada's troops in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2011. If John McCain is elected after Harper wins a majority, and decides another Middle Eastern country is looking at him the wrong way, is there enough in Harper's record to reassure us that he wouldn't bring Canada into an American-led invasion?</p> <p>So, with so much potentially at stake, why are we so uninterested in Canada's politics? Admittedly, even if Canada elected Conrad Black himself it would never be able to drag Britain into an illegal war - but is the fact that America has such an obvious impact on our lives the only reason we cover American politics so extensively in Europe? Is that really the reason the media here covers hurricanes only when they effect the US? The reason people watch The Wire? Surely Britons would at least claim we care about American politics because we also care about the lives of ordinary Americans, in and of themselves, and Barack Obama's and John McCain's domestic policies are reported extensively here. We're more concerned, obviously, with whether the next US president will invade another country than improve the domestic literacy rate, but we care about the US literacy rate too.<br> But even Canada's foreign policy, never mind its literacy rate, is largely ignored by the European media. Even before and beyond Harper, Canada's role in the war on terror has barely been scrutinised abroad - perhaps in part because its politics inconveniently ruptures neat periodisation. While 2001-2007 meant, for us, George Bush and Tony Blair, Canadians have gone through three prime ministers in this time.</p> <p>But it's perhaps due more to the way the rest of us buy wholesale into Canada's carefully crafted self-identity as the good-guys. After 9/11, Canada's good-guy image and the perceived rightness of the Afghanistan war were implicitly mutually reinforcing. Canada is a famously peaceful nation so, the implied reasoning went, the war in Afghanistan must be just because the mission was led by the nation of progressive liberals (even after 2006, when Canada elected Harper, they did this mainly because the Liberal party was eating itself while the Bloc Quebecois split the opposition votes. Canada's heart is still, generally, liberal). It often feels that Canada isn't treated as a nation so much as a totem, a moral barometer for western liberals elsewhere. Another mutually reinforcing binary: the not-Americans; the good-guys.</p> <p>This lazy equation was ruptured in the early 2000s, while progressives were too busy blaming America for all the world's evils to notice the complicity of the good-guys to the north. The incarceration and torture of Canadian citizen <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.ca/human_rights_issues/maher_arar_overview.php\">Maher Arar</a> at the hands of US authorities, and the Guant\u00e1namo detention of the Canadian minor <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/khadr/omar-khadr.html\">Omar Khadr</a>, were met with silence by the Liberals in Ottawa - the supposed good-guys in a nation of good-guys.</p> <p>The point here is not to paint Canada's response to the new realities of the 2000s as on par with Britain's or America's actions in these years. Of course there's an element truth at the heart of the crafted myth of Canada's liberal identity. I wouldn't have moved there for a year if there weren't. And of course it can feel difficult, as a British person opposed to the Iraq war, to criticise a country that had the strength not to be dragged into it.</p> <p>But, with all respect for that, perhaps it's time to recognise how the assumption that Canada is a problem-free good-guy nation is not only patronising to those who live there with far from problem-free lives \u2013 but also leaves, until we begin to unpick this assumption, a missing piece in our understanding of how the last seven years were allowed to happen.<br> If Obama wins the election less than a month after the Canadian election, the almost-unthinkable will happen: for the first time in generations, Canada will have a government that is more conservative than its southern neighbour. And perhaps that's what will restore America's reputation in Europe more than all the promises of hope and change: the day <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6666338/\">Canadian tourists put American flags</a> on their backpacks so that you'll treat them nicely.</p>",
  "<p>I recently booked two flights with easyJet and, as an infrequent flyer, discovered I am very out of touch with the vast range of fees levied by airlines these days. </p> <p>If I had paid by credit card I would have faced an additional charge of \u00a313. I opted to pay by debit card, which still landed me with a \u00a31.75 fee. But was it the right thing to do? <br><br>One of the reasons I prefer paying by credit card is the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2005/may/26/travelinsurance.yourrights\">extra protection </a>you get should anything go wrong with the company you are buying from. </p> <p>Thousands of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/aug/29/theairlineindustry.oilandgascompanies\">Zoom passengers</a> were caught out recently when the airline went under, and many had not paid by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/aug/29/travelnews.cheapflights\">credit card</a> so had no way of getting their money back (travel insurance rarely covers losses due to airlines going into liquidation). I realise the chances of easyJet going under are slim, but it pays to be careful. Would it have been worth paying \u00a313? </p> <p>It infuriated me that the credit card charge was so high. EasyJet charges a fee of 2.5% of the cost of your flights, with a minimum charge of \u00a34 for credit card payments. The company's press office tell me the fee is there because easyJet is charged by the bank. </p> <p>I checked Ryanair's policy to see how it compares. The airline also has high charges for bookings: \u00a34 a person per flight, regardless of whether you pay by debit or credit card. </p> <p>The only free way to pay on either airline is by Visa Electron, but not many people have one of these. </p> <p>It seems the charges are inescapable. For years now budget airlines have been making money from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7176401.stm\">additional fees</a> such as those imposed for priority boarding and checking in luggage, and it seems these have <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/2601651/Airline-charges-quadruple-in-two-years.html\">recently risen again</a>. </p> <p>Would you stump up the fee for the peace of mind you get by paying on credit card? And have you been shocked by the charges levied by so-called budget airlines?</p>",
  "<p>It's coming to something when the most rock 'n' roll moment of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/10/mercuryprize.popandrock\"><strong>Mercury Music Prize</strong> evening</a> is a bunch of merchant bankers behaving worse than the musicians or the hacks. But such were the scenes at last night's event at Grosvenor House hotel. During one of the acoustic tracks, some corporate types continued braying to each other - to the annoyance of nearby tables and musicians. The Mirror's Gavin Martin and Alun Palmer stepped up to the mark and politely asked the riotous group to pipe down. The pair were rewarded for their efforts by a bread roll being lobbed in Gavin's direction. It was then followed by a group of the refreshed bankers emptying an ice bucket of water over Alun. Cue the arrival of a phalanx of bouncers to bundle the miscreants away. As one wag put it: \"The bankers thought they were being like Chumbawamba. They were more like Chump-awambas.\"</p>",

She might well make knickers there, at a lower wage than she did in Underworld. These knickers would therefore be cheaper than those made in Underworld.

  "<p>\"Mexico has several national problems \u2026 one is social injustice, another is insecurity and the third is the lack of forwards,\" novelist and football author <a href=\"http://letrasdelmundo.tamaulipas.gob.mx/participantes/images/juan-villoro.jpg\">Juan Villoro</a> pronounced earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.elportaldemexico.com/arte/literatura/08juanvilloroentrevista.htm\">in an interview</a>. \"The Mexican public generally has little faith in results, we are less concerned about the denouement on the pitch because if we were very concerned we wouldn't be able to be such football fans. Especially at international level which is when Mexico is hardly ever a protagonist; more like never.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he thought there was any hope for the Mexican national team, Villoro said: \"That's one of Mexico's great challenges [\u2026] It's so hard to find good forwards in Mexico, ones that score goals. I think it's a structural problem in the league, it has to do with players being sold too fast, with tournaments which are too short for any long-term development strategy to work, too much TV influence, too much business interference \u2026 in short, I think it's a long-term problem which will not be resolved by a shaman, or a magician appointed to manage the national team.\"</p> <p>Several months on from the foretelling of the shaman's appointment, enter Don Sven-Goran Eriksson. Not exactly a magician, his arrival nevertheless has connotations of the ethereal world evoked by Castaneda in his epic writings about the adventures of Don Juan. The Mexican press has come up with the moniker 'Don Sven' when, amid high expectations regarding preparations for the World Cup qualifiers this week - Mexico beat Jamaica 3-0 at the Azteca last Saturday and face Canada tonight - quotes from Jamie Carragher's book were swiftly lifted round the globe. The <a href=\"http://www.impre.com/laraza/deportes/futbol-mexicano/2008/9/4/marcador--antilde;oran-a-sven--78846-1.html\">Don Sven's seduction lessons sorely missed</a> is a case in point.</p> <p>Eriksson may well be surprised to the extent to which his reputation pursues him. Perhaps he took the Mexico post wishing for quiet weekends in Yucatan <a href=\"http://www.cnnexpansion.com/actualidad/2008/05/12/sven-goran-eriksson-al-tri\">on a large salary</a>. Far from the madding European press, Mexico's appeal includes Caribbean beauty in an affluent setting: Mexico can be described as a rich country in as much as both life expectancy and income per capita <a href=\"http://graphs.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=6;ti=2006$zpv;v=1$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=199;dataMax=42642$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=25;dataMax=84$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=i143_t002006\">have been growing steadily since 1950</a>.</p> <p>Not only that, but Mexico's football industry ranks something like fourth in the world in terms of income and revenue. It enjoys a huge market and passionate supporters, and even <a href=\"http://forums.interbasket.net/showthread.php?p=188383\">the domestic league</a> is surpassed only by Brazil outside Europe. Like every other football association on the planet, the Mexican one is <a href=\"http://mexidata.info/id1058.html\">the target of criticism</a> and accusations of mismanagement. But the issue that needs addressing the most is perhaps why this firm position among the world's best in terms of wealth and revenue doesn't translate into results.</p> <p>Mexico has an international presence on the world stage. It reaches the World Cup finals. But, more often than not, the experience for Mexican fans is as described by Villoro in his book, <a href=\"http://www.leedor.com/products/ver_2_1795_%20Dios%20es%20Redondo.html\">God is Round</a>, \"dreaming a match soaked in glory only to awaken a few minutes from the final to face a shrapnel reality\".</p> <p>\"In order to understand the last few years of the Mexican national side one has to take into account [Ricardo] La Volpe's long process \u2013 the authoritarian Argentinian, unpopular, who achieves an acceptable play system based on tyranny but who never wins a title or achieves anything exceptional,\" Villoro tells me. \"With some solid arguments and quite a lot of spite, Hugo Sanchez criticised him harshly. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NSWhQ3INiw&amp;feature=related\">The best Mexican player of all time</a>, he got his turn managing the national side. The expectation was either absolute glory (something hard to achieve) or the possibility of lynching him (something more to hand). The latter was the case.</p> <p>\"Sven's arrival is like that of ET \u2013 he doesn't know Mexican football, he doesn't speak the language, he will be paid a lot more than Hugo and his prestige as club manager has never been reflected on a national side. His big mistake was to make his debut in an official match, a World Cup qualifier against Honduras, and he won by a lean 2-1 in spite of playing at home. Following La Volpe's tail he chose players who have become nationalised in an 'express' way but are not good enough to forgive the fact they take the place of a Mexican player. His lack of experience here led him to line up some young talent, [Carlos] Vela and Giovanni [dos Santos], who were world champions with the Under-17 side, but who don't have enough experience to carry the weight of such a big game (between them they barely have five goals in the first division).</p> <p>\"I foresee Sven's role will be very similar to Hugo's (mediocre and predictable), but I think he will manage the issue with more diplomacy. Curiously, he doesn't arrive promising great things, or hoping to give free reign to illusions, the way one might expect of a manager of his hierarchy, or the way [C\u00e9sar Luis] Menotti did. Rather, he comes to contribute common sense to a crazy environment, made all the crazier by commercial and political pressures.\"</p> <p>At the last Copa Am\u00e9rica, Mexico finished in third place, with Brazil and Argentina in front. This is more than 'dignified', as Villoro would say. But nevertheless, and in spite of some fans holding optimistic hopes that Sven will bring the necessary international and professional clout to the equation, Villoro remains sceptical. The 3-0 win against Jamaica he dismisses somewhat: \"It's relative - the rival was extremely weak. We played at home. It wasn't a great performance. Quite the contrary, I think one should criticise some of the mistakes and the weaker points. Mexico has always had a superior achievement to its Caribbean rivals.\"</p> <p>Sven-Goran Eriksson begins a new phase of his career in the new world. Many think he's taken the appointment like a diplomat might take on a well-paid stay in a far-away embassy. But in the world of the Quetzalcoatl, following the Byronian trail of Don Juan, it will be interesting to see how he will fare - will he measure up to the shaman's wisdom? On a Mexican literary website I found <a href=\"http://mexfiles.wordpress.com/category/sports/futbol/\">an image of Tezacatlapoca</a> with the caption: \"'Lord Smoking Mirror' is the god of the world we know, master of reality and unreality. Only Mexico would conceive of the master of the real world as a trickster.\"</p> <p>Perhaps Sven is the man for the job after all.</p>",

  "<p>When I picked my husband up at the San Francisco International airport on Sunday, it was with great trepidation that I admitted an infidelity. 'I have something to tell you,' I said, 'I've been cheating on you \u2014 with California.' His knowing smile beamed as he adjusted his sunglasses and put down the window of our borrowed Volvo. <br><br>I took him straight to the Mission district, to our old favourite, La Taqueria, for the self-proclaimed \"best burritos and tacos in the world.\" Full on beans, grilled steak, perfectly ripe mashed avocados and burning hot salsa, we hopped back in the car to head out to the country for the week. We needed to stock up on some supplies for a reunion supper, so we dropped into a market and loaded up on heirloom tomatoes in red, purple, yellow, green and orange; green and purple basil; cranberry beans, flamingo peppers, fresh baked breads; raspberries and the piece de r\u00e9sistance: peaches from Frog Hollow Farm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337473168\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/9/10/1221041843209/IMG_0665.jpg\" alt=\"slow food nation\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hardcore organic 'tude</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Ptak/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I had come out here at the end of August for Slow Food Nation, a huge event set up in locations throughout San Francisco to celebrate small farms, to encourage cooking with family and friends, to join discussions and lectures on the state of food and farming in America and the world. I had the honour of participating in Alice Water's Green Kitchen at the event. She asked a few chefs and friends to give short demonstrations on simple ideas in the kitchen. You could see how Paul Bertolli slices an onion, Oliver Rowe (from London's Konstam) blanches chard or David Chang makes tofu from soy milk.

Other friends cut the tomatoes up into wedges, picked basil, set the table, and washed lettuces. The lovely Angela Whitney arrived with a warm blackberry crisp made with the last berries of summer. Beautifully bubbly and golden, I ditched my peaches and raspberry dream. Actually it was perfect because they needed the extra day of ripening.

  "<p>David Cameron has marched on to traditional Labour territory by declaring that the Conservatives are now Britain's \"true champions for progressive ideals\". Tackling poverty, protecting the environment and kickstarting social mobility would be key goals in his first years in office. A Conservative government would adopt a fresh approach as central government is cut back, giving charities and voluntary groups an important role in delivering Cameron's three priorities: school reform, welfare reform and strengthening families. \"This is not going to be about the usual mechanisms of government,\" one member of the Cameron circle says. \"It is a completely new approach that the political world has not got a handle on.\" The Guardian today explains the new Tory thinking in 10 policy areas. Richard Reeves, director of Demos, then assesses whether Cameron can deliver \"progressive goals through Conservative means\". Demos is an independent thinktank which influenced Tony Blair and provided many of the policy ideas for New Labour. Recently it has been working with the Tories on seminars on the \"post-bureaucratic age\", one of Cameron's big themes. Reeves says that the Conservative march into progressive territory \"is not merely rhetorical\". Some policies score well, such as education and the environment. But he says the Tories remain \"too sceptical about the progressive potential of the state\" and are backward-looking on marriage and law and order\". And his conclusion? Overall, \"they are making progress\"</p> <h2>1. Economy</h2> <p>The Conservatives plan an evolutionary rather than revolutionary economic policy, having ruled out promises of unfunded tax cuts which have got them into so much trouble at previous elections. Given that the public finances are so deep in the red, they would have little room to cut taxes at all.</p> <p>But their long-standing promise is to \"share the proceeds of growth\" - in other words, to let public spending grow more slowly than the economy over time, thereby allowing them to cut taxes or reduce borrowing over the medium term. They have pledged to match Labour's planned 2% annual spending growth until 2011; they say there will be no \"blank cheque\" after that.</p> <p>Spending levels would be ringfenced until 2011 in health, education and international development. Spending on other departments could change, though the overall spending envelope would remain the same.</p> <p>Tax cuts would have to be fiscally neutral, at least in the first years in government. Many of these would be paid from a \"family fund\" to be financed mainly by green taxes, though they admit that opposition to these taxes is growing.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers purchasing homes up to \u00a3250,000</p> <p>\u00b7 Increase the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m a person, \u00a32m a couple</p> <p>\u00b7 Impose a \u00a325,000 levy on non-doms, generating \u00a32.8bn, to pay for stamp duty and IHT cuts</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>The short-term commitment to Labour spending plans is a break with the traditional tax-cutting agenda. And hitting non-doms was a long-overdue progressive goal. But on tax there is little to cheer: abolishing stamp duty helps those in the middle and the inheritance tax cuts is a boon for those at the top</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.economy\">Read more: economic policy</a></p> <h2>2. Welfare reform</h2> <p>The Conservatives are promising a \"full-bloodied version\" of what they call the government's \"half-hearted\" implementation of a radical report on welfare reform by the city financier David Freud. This calls for a greater role for the voluntary and private sector, who will be paid by results. They promise a two-pronged approach: tough new regulations from the centre coupled with a greater \"bottom-up\" approach for the voluntary and private sector.</p> <p>Tax credits, criticised by the Conservatives for masking rather than tackling the root causes of poverty, will be retained. But the Tories would aim to make them a less prominent tool in tackling poverty by improving people's skills as well, so they can secure better jobs and be less reliant on the state.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Tougher assessments for benefit claimants, notably the 2.6 million people claiming incapacity benefit as a result of illness or disability. All recipients of IB, excluding disabled people who cannot work, will undergo a \"work capability assessment\"</p> <p>\u00b7 People who refuse to join a return to work programme will lose the right to claim jobless benefits until they do</p> <p>\u00b7 The changes will be funded by a greater \"payment by results\" programme in which the voluntary and private sector will be paid when they succeed in returning people to work, and in keeping them there for two years</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>There is nothing progressive about leaving people in a state of long-term welfare dependency: independence is a key goal. Toughening up the conditions attached to benefits will be progressive if accompanied by measures to improve employability: bringing in non-state providers may help to achieve this so long as sufficient investment is made </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.welfare\">Read more: welfare policy</a></p> <h2>3. Family</h2> <p>Family breakdown lies at the heart of Britain's \"broken society\", according to David Cameron, who will recognise marriage and civil partnerships through the tax and benefit system.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, told the Guardian this week that marriage was the best environment in which to raise children.</p> <p>Cameron will also introduce measures to make Britain more \"family-friendly\". A key proposal is a health visitor for all mothers of newborn babies, to be paid from the budget for \"outreach workers\" in the Sure Start programme.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 End the \"couple penalty\" in the benefit system which means, according to the Tories, that people are encouraged to live apart</p> <p>\u00b7 All parents to be offered 12 months' parental leave, to be shared by mother and father</p> <p>\u00b7 Universal health visiting service to all mothers of newborn babies. This will include a minimum guarantee of two visits in the home for all mothers in the later stages of pregnancy, six hours of support in the first two weeks after birth, with a series of staggered visits leading to two visits a year for all one- to five-year-olds</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>3/5</p> <p>The Conservatives have set the pace on \"family friendly policies\" such as parental leave and are willing to invest in the critical early months after having children; more support for carers and fathers should be the next steps. But the tax break for marriage is a nostalgic irrelevance</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.family.policy\">Read more: family policy</a></p> <h2>4. Health</h2> <p>The Tories believe that Alan Milburn, Labour's most radical health secretary, will look on with envy as they introduce what they describe as a true NHS marketplace, free at the point of delivery and funded out of central taxation.</p> <p>Milburn wanted all NHS hospitals in England to have the opportunity to become independent foundation trusts by 2008, competing with each other for patients and free to borrow to fund investment. But just over half the NHS trusts remain under Whitehall control because they cannot yet pass a fitness test showing they are ready for independence. The Tories want an independent NHS board to direct the commissioning of healthcare, deciding what level of service can be afforded within the budget set by parliament. It would not run NHS hospitals or GP surgeries.</p> <p>A Conservative government would not set \"targets\", such as reduced waiting times. But it would demand certain \"outcomes\", such as an increased survival rate from cancer, which would be published.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong> </p> <p>\u00b7 Phasing out \"process-driven targets\", to measure \"outcomes\" instead</p> <p>\u00b7 Giving patients a choice of provider so they can use published information to decide what care they receive</p> <p>\u00b7 Introduce \"payment-by-results\" to reward hospitals and doctors that achieve high standards</p> <p>\u00b7 Rename health secretary as public health secretary</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Giving patients more power is a highly progressive goal. More competition should drive up standards. Greater autonomy for professionals may boost productivity. But without clear targets the danger of a \"postcode lottery\" will rise. The party's support for \"local\" GPs betrays their own conservatism on the institutional structure of healthcare</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.health\">Read more: health policy</a></p> <h2>5. Education/skills</h2> <p>A key ambition in public services - to pick up the \"baton of reform\" left by Tony Blair - applies strongly in education.</p> <p>Greater freedom would be granted to academies because the Conservatives believe the government has given local education authorities too great a say.</p> <p>A \"supply-side revolution\" to provide more than 220,000 new school places would have at its heart a Swedish-style system of not-for-profit \"free\" schools, run by charities, community groups and faith leaders working along the lines of academies. Working within the state sector, they would have access to equivalent levels of fund per pupil that is given to existing state schools.</p> <p>Spending would be increased on pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, with a premium added to the \"per pupil\" funding formula.</p> <p>The Tories would change the vocational training system to make it easier for employers to give apprenticeships, which would in turn be more responsive to the demands of the job market.</p> <p>They would redirect the current \u00a31.3bn skills budget, with \u00a3775m going directly on apprenticeships.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 New laws to improve headteachers' powers to curb poor behaviour by scrapping pupil appeal panels which assess pupils' complaints when they feel they have been unfairly excluded</p> <p>\u00b7 Ensure that every child that is capable of doing so is reading by the age of six</p> <p>\u00b7 Reform schools inspection regime to ensure \"more searching scrutiny of under-performance\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Lead a \"demand-led training revolution\" by abolishing the Learning and Skills Council and creating \"lifelong learning accounts\" to allow people to spend an allocation of money on training</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>4/5</p> <p>The \"academisation\" of British education is largely to be welcomed, and the Conservatives are in the lead. Extra resources targeted at the poorest pupils, greater autonomy for school leaders, and more choice for parents: all good news. What's missing is a distinct strategy on pre-school education</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.education\">Read more: education policy</a></p> <h2>6. Law and order</h2> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, will adopt a tough and tender approach. As an advocate of civil liberties, Grieve would need persuading as home secretary to abandon his campaign against the pre-charge detention of terror suspects for up to 42 days. ID cards would also be abolished.</p> <p>In other areas, he would adopt a tough stance. Grieve would amend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act so that police no longer need to secure authorisation to conduct surveillance on those suspected of non-terrorist offences.</p> <p>The Tories would accept the government's points-based system on immigration. But they would toughen it by imposing an annual limit on immigration from outside the EU.</p> <p>Prisons would provide a testbed for some of the Tories' most radical \"bottom- up\" ideas. Private companies and voluntary groups would be hired - on a \"payment by results\" basis - to steer inmates away from a life of crime in an attempt to cut re-offending rates, which account for a high proportion of crime.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Border police force to \"secure Britain's borders\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Directly elected police commissioners to replace police authorities</p> <p>\u00b7 Increase prison capacity by 5,000 over Labour's plans</p> <p>\u00b7 Replace automatic release for prisoners with earned release</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Abandoning the 42 day pre-charge detention and scrapping ID cards may win over the hearts of Islington liberals: but in terms of overall policy the Tories need to focus less on policing and prisons and more on the \"causes of crime\". They claim to be anti-state, but rely on it much too heavily here</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.justice\">Read more: law and order policy</a></p> <h2>7. Environment</h2> <p>The battle against climate change was one of Cameron's early themes when he sought to \"decontaminate\" the Conservative brand. In recent months he has faced criticism for downgrading the environment.</p> <p>Cameron sought to restore the balance in June when he said the world could not afford to abandon the environment, even in an economic downturn. A Tory government would adopt \"realistic environmentalism\" that would have four core elements: green taxes to encourage good behaviour; stringent rules to encourage greener cars; a framework to encourage greener energy; and \"nudge\" ideas, such as listing how much energy people use on their fuel bills, to encourage energy efficiency.</p> <p>Tories say they will take a major step later this year when they launch what is being dubbed as the \"first coherent UK strategy for transforming Britain into a low carbon economy\". This is expected to offer stronger support for nuclear power.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Average emissions for new cars down to 100 grams per km by 2030</p> <p>\u00b7 Green taxes, which would not apply retrospectively, would go into a \"family fund\" to finance tax relief for families</p> <p>\u00b7 Replace climate change levy, a tax on energy, with carbon levy to distinguish between high and low carbon production</p> <p>\u00b7 Use money from EU emissions trading scheme to fund at least three carbon capture and storage demonstration projects</p> <p>\u00b7 Ensure that carbon emissions rate generated in new power stations cannot be higher than amount generated in modern gas-fired power stations</p> <p>\u00b7 Creation of \"feed-in tariffs\" with people paid for energy produced from, for example, solar panels</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>4/5</p> <p>The Conservatives have gone green, ticking boxes on micro-generation, carbon pricing, emissions standards and - maybe - the third Heathrow runway. Ring-fencing proceeds from green taxes for families is smart. But they have not paid enough attention to the impact of expensive carbon on poorer families - and look to be leaning too heavily on nuclear power</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.green.politics\">Read more: environment policy</a></p> <h2>8. Transport</h2> <p>Cameron says that gridlocked roads and slow, packed trains are neither good for business nor the environment. He would launch a feasibility study to introduce an expanded high speed train network, would tackle the worst bottlenecks and look at ways of giving parents an alternative to the school run to reduce congestion.</p> <p>The City of London has been worried that Cameron has tilted too far in favour of the environment. There was alarm in June when he appeared to rule out a third runway at Heathrow on the grounds that the government should try and make the airport \"better, not bigger\".</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Give \u00a3200m a year from the transport innovation fund to local authorities to encourage alternatives to car use</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>1/5</p> <p>Good rhetoric - non-existent policies. Another feasibility study on high-speed rail? There are countless initiatives already in place to discourage the school run. In transport you have to put your money where your mouth is: and the Conservatives have failed to make a single significant commitment likely to improve our transport infrastructure</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.transport\">Read more: transport policy</a></p> <h2>9. Local govt/housing</h2> <p>The Conservatives' new \"bottom-up\" approach will be tested in local government and housing as the party pledges a genuine devolution.</p> <p>Local government financing could be taken out of the hands of ministers who currently control the funding of 80% of council services. The overall level of funding would be decided centrally but the distribution would be set independently.</p> <p>The Tories say the government is setting unrealistic house building targets - 3m new homes by 2020. Instead of issuing central targets they will encourage local communities to accept new homes by introducing incentives.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Allow local authorities to retain a portion of local business rates</p> <p>\u00b7 Dismantle the \"bureaucratic quangocracy\" of regional assemblies and regional development agencies</p> <p>\u00b7 Remove council tax capping and instead hold local referendums to approve increases in council taxes \"more than the norm\"</p> <p>\u00b7 Encourage housebuilding by allowing local councils to keep the proceeds from council taxes paid by residents in newly built homes</p> <p>\u00b7 Scrap home information packs (Hips)</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>2/5</p> <p>Referendums in place of council tax capping is a bold democratic move, but will also test the strength of local polities. \"Bureaucratic quangocracies\" make for good political targets, but it is not clear what the Conservatives would do to support economic development in disadvantaged areas</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.local.government\">Read more: local government and housing policy</a></p> <h2>10. Foreign affairs</h2> <p>The Conservative approach to foreign affairs embodies the old and the new.</p> <p>On the new side, Cameron has pledged to meet the UN target on aid spending.</p> <p>On the old side, Cameron would be Britain's most Eurosceptic prime minister. His plan to reverse Britain's ratification of the Lisbon treaty, if the measure has not entered EU law by the time of a British general election, would be opposed by virtually every EU leader.</p> <p>Cameron would have an easier ride with the transatlantic special relationship. He enjoys warm relations with John McCain and had a friendly meeting with Barack Obama in July.</p> <p>Describing himself as a liberal Conservative in a speech in Islamabad last week, Cameron sought to reshape Tony Blair's \"liberal interventionism\" when he said he was sceptical about \"grand utopian schemes to re-make the world according to a politician's timetable\". His visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan was designed to underline a key theme: that there is no longer a separation between foreign and domestic affairs. They come together under the heading of \"national security\", because what happens in Pakistan now has a direct bearing on Britain.</p> <p><strong>Policies</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Meet UN target on aid spending - 0.7% of GNI - by 2013</p> <p>\u00b7 Create a national security council, to be headed by Lady Neville-Jones</p> <p><strong>Demos progressive rating</strong></p> <p>3/5</p> <p>Europe remains the Conservatives' achilles heel in foreign affairs. Until Cameron gets Europe right his efforts to sketch a 21st century foreign policy will fail. But the Conservatives have developed a thoughtful approach to international development, especially on issues such as corruption and governance, aid effectiveness, and fragile states</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/10/conservatives.foreign.policy\">Read more: foreign policy</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>11.20am</strong> We have cricket at Taunton, and good-quality cricket too, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. It doesn't get much better than Steve Harmison running in to bowl to Marcus Trescothick. Somerset vs Durham has the feel of a championship decider, but there are fears that it won't come up to scratch. Somerset, four points behind the leaders, Notts, with a game in hand, may tactically settle for the draw points, even though Durham are the other county with three games left.</p> <p>The first day has already been lost to rain so a benign pitch would probably kill the contest. Trescothick said the last one was \"like batting at Karachi\". We could do with this one behaving like Headingley. Durham have dropped Liam Plunkett, Andrew Caddick is missing for Somerset. And Justin Langer has just had a life - badly dropped on 27 by the wicketkeeper, Phil Mustard, off Callum Thorpe.</p> <p>I had a long chat to Trescothick yesterday, in the week of the publication of his autobiography. He exudes contentment. His stress-related depressive illness might mean that his England career is over, but he talks of playing for Somerset until he is 40. He can still provide a lot of pleasure in the years ahead.</p> <p><strong>11.40am</strong> Trescothick dismissed by Harmison for 18, caught by Callum Thorp. Langer also out, bowled Thorp for 31. Somerset 55-2.</p> <p><strong>12.35pm</strong> The notion that a not-quite-match-fit Shoaib Akhtar was going to be Surrey's saviour in their increasingly forlorn battle against relegation was always far-fetched, and four largely innocuous overs first things this morning will not have encouraged hopes of survival, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at The Oval</em>. Shoaib did whistle his second delivery past Chris Benham's outside edge, but after 24 deliveries that flatteringly cost him just seven runs, he was replaced by Alex Tudor and sent to shiver in his sweater at mid-on.</p> <p>Predictably enough, the two Hampshire wickets to fall went to the Bloke At The Other End, who in this instance was Jade Dernbach. Benham went first, shouldering arms in Dernbach's first over \u2013 the second of the morning \u2013 after almost falling in identical fashion the ball before. That made it 117 for three and four overs later it was 125 for four when Dernbach persuaded Sean Ervine to drag an attempted off-side force on to his stumps.</p> <p>But Michael Lumb knuckled down, occasionally breaking free to clip Tudor off his toes and cut James Benning behind backward point, and by the interval Hampshire \u2013 who themselves are glancing nervously over their shoulders at the relegation zone \u2013 had reached 208 for four, with Lumb on 69 and the ever-reliable Nic Pothas 38. Surrey will be hoping Shoaib has a light lunch.</p> <p><strong>12.40pm</strong> One other county cricket story catches the attention today, <em>writes David Hopps at Taunton</em>. It seems that Darren Gough might not be retiring after all. He has received offers from Yorkshire and other counties to play Twenty20 next season and has told Yorkshire that he will consider their offer when he sees how he \"survives the winter\". That's the sort of thing elderly people say when asked if they are going on holiday next summer. \"My body might be 100 per cent then or it might be in bits,\" Gough said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at Taunton, Somerset are rebuilding cautiously after the loss of Justin Langer and Marcus Trescothick. Trescothick's departure was disappointing. Having just cleared fine leg when top-edging Steve Harmison, he clumsily edged the next one into third slip's hands. Somerset are 87-2 at lunch.</p> <p><strong>12.45pm</strong> After much suspicious prodding and poking, mainly by Pasty Harris, play finally began at 11.30am at Wantage Road, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. The session lasted an hour, at the end of which Northants are 48-0. Niall O'Brien is 33 not out, Stephen Peters a laborious 6. Peters was dropped by John Maunders in the first over - he flashed hard at David Masters, and Maunders, only registered by Essex to play first team on Monday, couldn't hang on. </p> <p>Pitch looks good, so given the forecast, it's almost certainly a competition for bonus points. The ice-cream van has arrived, somewhat optimistically, and one of our number is wondering how many cider lollies you would have to consume to feel any effects.</p> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> The new Swalec Stadium doesn't look much brighter today than when I was here for the ODI between England and South Africa a week ago, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. And that was a wash-out.</p> <p>There has been a lot of rain here in the past month and the start of the championship match between Glamorgan and Worcestershire has been delayed. They had a look this morning and they will be looking again at 2pm with a view to starting at about 3pm or 3.30pm.<br> Worcestershire need the points to clinch the second division title. Today they plan to unveil new signing Dilhara Fernando, the Sri Lanka fast bowler who has appeared in 30 Tests. Fernando, who will appear as an overseas player, has been brought in to plug the gap left by the injured Kabir Ali, who has a back stress fracture. But there will be no final away appearance for the retiring Graeme Hick, who is out again with his injured right elbow. Worcestershire are hoping that Hick will be fit enough to make his final appearance for the county against Middlesex at Kidderminster next week.</p> <p>Even if he's not fully fit Hick will probably play, even though he's struggling to bat or throw the ball. It's a pity it's not Worcester, though, scene of so many of his triumphs, for his sake and those of his many supporters.</p> <p><strong>2.41pm</strong> Somerset's director of cricket, Brian Rose, confided at lunchtime that 300 would be a good first-innings score on this Taunton pitch, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. The benign surface we had feared has not materialised and although this is a surface of little pace. there is some encouragement for all the bowlers.</p> <p>Somerset have lost James Hildreth and Wesley Durston since lunch. Last week I erroneously referred to Mr Durston as Wesley Dursley, and seem to have mixed him up with a combination of three Harry Potter characters: Vernon Dursley, Dudley Dursley and Percy Wesley. Dudley Dursley, Harry's cousin, is the leader of a gang of thugs, which is a bit unfair on both Durston, who Somerset aficianados praise as an affable bloke, and Somerset, who are not at all thuggish. The Dursleys are all Muggles and hate anything to do with magic; Durston wasn't very happy with a spot of sorcery from Paul Wiseman, who turned one to bowl him for 19.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Yorkshire's prospects of escaping the drop to Division Two have been undermined by the EU, which has ruled that acres are no more and now must be referred to as hectares. The county proudly referred to as The Broad Acres might be expected to avoid relegation. A county about to be renamed as The Broad Hectares is clearly going down.</p> <p><strong>2.50pm</strong> Shoaib Akhtar must have a clause in his Surrey contract limiting him to four-over spells only, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at The Oval</em>. After conceding seven runs in the first of them at the start of the day, he returned for another burst after lunch with the second new ball, only to leak 21 runs and receive a talking-to from Neil Mallender for sending down a beamer to Nic Pothas. In truth it was little more than a slower ball gone wrong, but Shoaib's discussion with Mallender, who consulted with his colleague Nigel Llong at square-leg, verged on the heated. </p> <p>Out came the teapot pose that has so exasperated Pakistan captains over the years and there was a dismissive gesture with the right hand as Shoaib finally turned back to his mark for the next delivery. At the end of the over he trudged down to fine-leg, chucked his sweater over the boundary and sought sympathy from his compatriot Saqlain Mushtaq, who was off the field at the time. Even when he is not taking wickets, Shoaib is box-office.</p> <p>And so \u2013 typical Shoaib \u2013 he decided to cling on to a top-class catch instead. With half an hour to go before tea and Surrey desperate for a breakthrough, Liam Dawson failed to control a pull off Alex Tudor and was superbly held at fine-leg by a tumbling Shoaib. That left Hampshire on 286 for six, having earlier lost Michael Lumb for 72 in controversial circumstances. Pushing forward to Saqlain, he edged low to slip where Scott Newman claimed the catch. Lumb stayed his ground, only for the umpires to send him on his way. The Surrey fielders did the same and Lumb fumed all the way to the pavilion. Hampshire could now do with Pothas reaching three figures. He currently has 73.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong> Unusual dismissals of the season no 61: Zander de Bruyn, run out by two yards by Ben Harmison at fine leg, attempting a third-leg bye, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. Particularly senseless, says David Hopps at Taunton, as De Bruyn's 75 had held Somerset together. Somerset 198-6 at tea. Durham hold a slight advantage.</p> <p><strong>3.50pm</strong> After an uneventful hour's play this morning, the afternoon session has fairly motored along, <em>reports Richard Rae at Northampton</em>. From 48-0, Northants have progressed to 255-6 at tea. Niall O'Brien was bowled behind his legs for 45, sweeping at James Middlebrook, Rob White threw the bat at a wide delivery from Ravi Bopara and was caught by Ryan ten Doeschate on the cover boundary for 24, Peters was yorked by Bopara for 41, Wessells was leg before to Napier for 17, Klusener edged his first delivery off Napier low to Pettini at first slip - a lazy waft - and Boje, on 37, has just top edged an attempted pull at Bopara hit to Pettini at mid-on. David Sales is not out 56. </p> <p>With the exception of Peters, and obviously Klusener, all the batsmen have scored quickly, particularly Sales, whose 50 came off 47 balls, and Nicky Boje. Sales hit his first ball for four, stroked through cover, and his next scoring shot was an apparently effortless straight six off Bopara. But then he so often does time the ball beautifully, and even allowing for the fact he's playing at Northampton, surely he'd have played for England if he'd taken his fitness seriously.</p> <p><strong>4.40pm</strong> No cricket at the Swalec Stadium today, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. The trouble centred on the run-up at the Cathedral Road end of the ground. It is sodden and has refused to dry out all day. </p> <p>No one could accuse umpires Barry Duddlestone and Stephen Garrett of not doing their best to get play under way. There were five inspections but after the last of them, at 4pm, it was decided that there would be no play. And with more rain forecast overnight, tomorrow is already in some doubt.</p>",
  "<p>The Chinese government launched an investigation today into the devastating mud and rock slide in Shanxi province, as the death toll rose to 128 and hopes faded for those buried.</p> <p>State media initially blamed torrential rains for triggering the wall of sludge, which destroyed buildings around a mine in Xiangfen, Linfen city, on Monday. But senior officials subsequently said the disaster appeared to have been caused by the collapse of a waste reservoir at the Tashan iron ore mine.</p> <p>\"Our preliminary investigation found that this accident was caused by illegal enterprises that discharged waste sand into a mine tailings dam,\" said Wang Dexue, the deputy head of the state administration of work safety.</p> <p>\"When the dam reached its capacity, it burst. Heavy rain accelerated the process,\" he told state television.</p> <p>Wei Guanghui, a migrant worker, told the China Daily newspaper: \"It was terrible. The mud roared down the valley and washed away the market and houses in a few minutes.\"</p> <p>Witnesses told the state news agency, Xinhua, that the slide was several metres high and destroyed houses, a market and a three-storey office building in minutes.</p> <p>An official at the propaganda department of Xiangfen county said: \"There were survivors on the first day and on the second day, but from day three it's very likely that anyone we find in the future will be dead already.\"</p> <p>Speaking from the site by telephone, she told the Associated Press news agency that more than 2,000 police, firefighters and villagers were searching.</p> <p>State radio has said hundreds could be trapped beneath the thick layers of mud and debris, which flowed for up to two miles. Many of the victims are believed to be migrant workers from south-west China, making it harder to know exactly who was buried.</p> <p>Hu Yanzai, the party secretary of a neighbouring village, told Reuters: \"It's hard to estimate how many died. It's all mud and we don't know how many escaped.</p> <p>\"I'd estimate at least 100 [dead]. It's a big area ... I don't know what to feel. I feel numb.\"</p> <p>The People's Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, said the state council - China's cabinet - had launched an investigation, and nine people, including the mine owner, had been detained.</p> <p>Xinhua said several officials, including the local head of the work safety bureau, had been sacked.</p> <p>Reuters reported that some relatives and friends kept away from the site by police have accused officials of cold-hearted incompetence.</p> <p>\"It's not because of the rain. It wasn't a natural disaster, it was manmade,\" said a worker named Zhang, who said his friend was probably dead.</p> <p>\"Whole families have gone. So many are dead. Why aren't you digging out our relatives?\" a middle-aged woman, Zheng Xiongmei, screamed at an official.</p> <p>China's mining industry is the world's deadliest, killing 3,800 people last year despite substantial safety improvements. Iron ore mines like Tashan have attracted less attention than coal mines because they are usually open cast, so less likely to collapse.</p> <p>Shanxi this spring began a three-year campaign to lower hazards from mines and mining waste, according to local media. Officials said 676 villages were threatened by subsidence, building damage and other geological hazards.</p>",

  "<p>There's an interview in today's G2 with <a href=\"http://chocstarblog.blogspot.com/\">Petra Barran</a>, a nomadic chocolatier who has been touring the country, seeking out strangers willing to provide her with an evening meal and a night's board in return for one of her exquisite puddings - chilled chocolate, amaretto, orange and almond terrine, for example. At first, many people she approached from the ice-cream van she has revamped into a chocmobile, eyed her with suspicion but, says Barran, \"chocolate can melt the scowl off the most hardcore faces\". </p> <p>Contrary to the stereotype of standoffish Brits, Barran has been welcomed open-armed into homes across the nation. One of her hosts took her foraging for supper near Hadrian's Wall (in return for Venezuelan Black chocolate sauce), while a family in Inverness had their children dress up and perform traditional Scottish dancing in her honour (she made them a colossal brownie fudge sundae for their trouble). <br><br>Like Barran's hosts, I too have a sweet tooth, and like to think of myself as sociable. I must admit, though, that I'm engaged in a small tussle with my soul just now, trying to persuade myself that I'd welcome a complete stranger into my flat overnight, for a dessert. I guess with Barran, there's more to it than that; people will also get a kick from facilitating and taking part in her adventure. But just how far would your generosity stretch for a scrumptious chocolate pudding?</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps it was a slow news day when the BBC reported last week that Australia is \"suffering from an unprecedented <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7589382.stm\">man drought</a>\". Because for the lonely, increasingly desperate women here in <a href=\"http://blogs.smh.com.au/lifestyle/asksam/\">Sydney</a>, this wasn't \"news\" at all. Nor was it news for the men who have decided to try their luck down under in response to a bikini-clad <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Bingle\">Lara Bingle</a>'s entreaty \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn0lwGk4u9o\">Where the bloody hell are you?</a>\" on behalf of Tourism Australia in 2006. <br> I know at least two such men. Let's call them Tom and Luke, for those are indeed their names. One is an accountant, the other is an auctioneer. As such, they both have experience of figures and markets and of being single for a long time. So, rather like the sub-plot in that crashingly awful film, Love Actually, in which the socially awkward goon from the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0550994/\">BT ads</a> goes to the States purely because he's heard American girls love socially awkward English blokes, they have chanced their arm abroad in the hope that they, too, might be immediately pounced upon by the Aussie equivalent of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193846/\">Jack Bauer</a>'s daughter and her bisexual roommates. Have Tom and Luke succeeded in the same way as BT man? Tune in to the bottom of this blog to find out. </p> <p>For those of you still with me, the theory of the Australian \"man drought\" \u2013 and indeed the term itself \u2013 was conceived a few years ago by KPMG demographer <a href=\"http://www.bernardsalt.com.au/\">Bernard Salt</a>, who has since written a book on the subject, <a href=\"http://www.bernardsalt.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=105\">Man Drought and Other Social Issues of the New Century</a>.</p> <p>The man drought isn't just a perception; there are figures to back it up. Census data shows there were 54,000 more men than women aged 30-something in Australia in 1976. But in 2008 there are 20,000 fewer men than women aged 30-something \u2013 the key reproductive age group in today's developed world. Overall, there are almost 100,000 more females than males in Australia. Which, in a country of 20 million people, makes quite a difference. </p> <p>In his book, Salt prattles on about the \"tides of love\". He believes that your love prospects depend on the stage you are in life: between the ages of 18 and 30, men who are looking to find the woman of their dreams will be disappointed as there is a \"Sheila shortage\" from their late teens right through to their late 20s. Meanwhile women during this period have their pick of men as there are simply more men than women.</p> <p>\"The reality is that women have more than enough candidates for their affections in their 20s\", says Salt, explaining that they are sought by males of all ages. The tipping point comes around the age of 34 when women find themselves \"on another planet\", as Salt charmingly puts it. \"The man drought kicks in at 34 and then it just gets worse and worse every year thereafter.\"</p> <p>So what has caused this \"man drought\"? There are several reasons. Some 30 years ago, Australia was raining men as a result of immigration policies that were skewed towards them. \"Baby-boomer women pairing up in the 1970s had it easy\", says Salt. \"There were more men than women due to a postwar immigration programme that favoured men.\"</p> <p>However, 30 years later, the odds have shifted dramatically due to social and industrial changes. Firstly, men are more likely to travel and then emigrate than females who may travel for a short time, but usually return to the bosom of the family.</p> <p>Secondly, the globalisation of labour is now attracting young men in particular out of Australia to stronger economies in other countries. \"Australian men are now more likely to seek out job opportunities overseas and our immigration programme is more balanced in terms of its intake of males and females\", says Salt. \"The slightly more male occupations are being attracted out of Australia. It upsets the gender balance.\"</p> <p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about 5% of the Australian population \u2013 between 750,000 and 1 million people \u2013 live overseas, with the most popular destinations being the UK, the US, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong.</p> <p>Added to this is the fact that in a country as geographically immense as Australia \u2013 30 times the size of the UK with less than a third of the population \u2013 it is possible for substantial areas of gender imbalance to arise. Not only are numbers of men in Australia's major cities dwindling but the number of women moving to those cities is growing. Young women no longer sit around in country towns waiting to marry Brett the farm hand from next door (ie 73 miles away). They are up and off to a coastal city at the first opportunity to pursue job opportunities, further education and hunky surfers. </p> <p>The situation outside of the larger towns and cities is very different. Vast numbers of women have abandoned poor old Brett and his pals, leaving behind communities overloaded with younger males and sheep \u2013 hence the obsession in this country with reality TV show <a href=\"http://channelnine.ninemsn.com.au/tvshow.aspx?sectionid=8870&amp;sectionname=farmer2&amp;sectionid=5603&amp;sectionname=farmerwantsawife\">The Farmer Wants a Wife</a>. </p> <p>In his book, Salt similarly suggests the solution for older women is to move out of the cities and into the remote, rural farming and mining communities where men are still in plentiful supply. In the Queensland town of Glenden, for example, there is one single female for every 23 men. </p> <p>So difficult is this issue, Salt has forecast that single people will begin \"geography dating\", or using the internet to define the hotspots for the person they want to meet. By analysing census data and conducting his own research, he has compiled a \"love map\" of Australia \u2013 taking into account every single town in the country \u2013 to show how the various clusters of unattached men and women are distributed across the Australian continent. </p> <p>It shows that many of Sydney and Melbourne's men are beginning to move interstate to Perth, Darwin and regional Queensland, chasing the gold and associated economic explosion in Australia's <a href=\"http://money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=110345\">mining boom</a> while the rest of the world feels the credit crunch.</p> <p>Mining companies are now actively trying to recruit women in order to address the gender imbalance, with one Western Australia-based company openly <a href=\"http://www.skillsone.com.au/News/Article/416/3/\">suggesting</a>: \"If you're a young woman looking for a man and a career, it might be time to go west\". There is also now a dating website for miners \u2013 <a href=\"http://meetaminingman.com.au/\">Meet a Mining Man</a> that aims to connect 90,000 male mining employees in the country on fly-in-fly-out work rosters with single local women.</p> <p>So is it happy days for footloose men in Sydney? Let's ask Tom first. \"There is certainly a lot more interest, which was nice at first,\" he says. \"But often those women are obviously in a rush to get married and have kids, which is quite off-putting. The 25-year-olds play a lot harder to get.\" <br> What about Luke? \"Most blokes in this city are either married or gay, so I'm cashing in like nobody's business. Sydney is the best city on earth. I'm never going home. Where the bloody hell are you indeed?\" </p> <p>Trailfinders (0845 0505892) offer one-way flights to Sydney from \u00a3549. You know, just in case you're interested.</p>"
