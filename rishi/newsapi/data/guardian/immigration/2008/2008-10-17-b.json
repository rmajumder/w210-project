  "<p>In late July, when Barack Obama toured the Middle East, he met the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, for a private briefing on the state of the world's most intractable conflict - a major priority for the next occupant of the Oval Office.</p> <p>Abbas revealed later that when he told the Democratic candidate about the Arab peace initiative - offering Israel normal relations with all 22 Arab countries in exchange for a Palestinian state - Obama's (clearly private) response was unambiguous: \"The Israelis must be crazy not to accept that.\"</p> <p>It's a telling anecdote that is highly relevant as Arabs and Israelis await the outcome of the US election and ponder how - or whether - their faltering peace process can be sustained or revived once a new administration is in place. After eight disastrous years of George Bush, and zero hopes for an 11th-hour negotiating breakthrough between Palestinians and Israelis, there is a real thirst for change in Washington.</p> <p>And it is also high time, some argue, to revisit that Arab initiative not because it can by itself resolve those knotty bilateral issues of borders, settlements, Jerusalem and refugees - but because it could help persuade sceptical Israelis that there are benefits and a place for them in the wider Middle East.</p> <p>The plan Abbas described to Obama was launched by the Saudi Crown Prince (now King) Abdullah at the 2002 Beirut Arab summit, and it is another leading Saudi royal who is promoting it again now: Prince Turki al-Faisal, the king's nephew, is the ex-head of Saudi intelligence as well as former ambassador to London and Washington. Not much has happened in the Middle East in the last 30 years that he wasn't involved in or doesn't have intimate knowledge of.</p> <p>So despite insisting that he was speaking as a private individual, there was rapt attention this week when he appealed to Israelis to listen carefully to what the initiative actually says - and to respond positively to it. </p> <p>Every Arab state, as Turki put it, \"made clear that they will pay the price for peace, not only by recognising Israel as a legitimate state in the area, but also to normalise relations with it and end the state of hostilities that had existed since 1948.\"</p> <p>The quid pro quo was that Israel too must \"accept peace as a strategic choice ... withdraw completely from all the lands they occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem ... accept a just solution for the refugee problem ... and recognise the independent state of Palestine.\"</p> <p>No serving Israeli officials were present at the \"track-two\" dialogue organised by the Oxford Research Group. But former (and still influential) denizens of the worlds of diplomacy, the military and intelligence were there along with a leading pro-Abbas Palestinian, senior Egyptians, Americans and Britons. Representatives of Hamas, Syria and Iran, either official or unofficial, were conspicuously absent.</p> <p>It was common ground that part of the problem is that the Arab initiative was overshadowed by the worst incident of the second intifada - when a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 30 Israelis at their Passover meal on the eve of the Beirut summit - and Israel reoccupied most of the West Bank.</p> <p>The plan generated headlines when it was re-endorsed, again under Saudi auspices, at the Riyadh Arab summit last year. But thanks to Israeli objections it did not get a mention when Bush convened the Annapolis conference a few months later. The Annapolis goal of Israeli-Palestinian agreement by the end of his presidency looks like a bad joke.</p> <p>Ignorance is part of the problem. As someone quipped: you can wake an Israeli of a certain age at 3am, say the word \"Khartoum\" and he will immediately identify the post-1967 war Arab summit in the Sudanese capital that produced three notorious \"noes\" - no peace, no recognition, no negotiations with Israel (which set the Arab consensus, broken only by Egypt, for the next 20 years). But the Saudi plan, which says exactly the opposite, is still likely to produce blank stares at any time.</p> <p>Ehud Olmert, Israel's outgoing prime minister, misrepresented the Arab initiative as a take-it-or-leave-it diktat, claiming it required the return of millions of Palestinian refugees - a red line for the any Israeli government - when it in fact talks sensibly of reaching \"a just solution\". Nor does it preclude negotiating land swaps, for example, so that Palestinians would get territory to compensate them for areas where post-1967 Israeli settlements cannot be moved.</p> <p>Israelis who are familiar with the plan often say they still crave some grand gesture as evidence of Arab goodwill - citing Anwar Sadat's dramatic, taboo-breaking journey to Jerusalem in 1977 (though in fact Sadat had been promised the return of the Sinai peninsula before he got on the plane).</p> <p>The response, from Prince Turki and others, is that Arab relations with Israel cannot undergo wholesale \"normalisation\" - a highly sensitive word in the political lexicon of the Middle East - until Israel shows it is prepared to resolve the Palestinian issue. Settlement activity in the West Bank - doubled since Oslo in 1993 and continuing since Annapolis - is hardly a signal of that.</p> <p>\"Instead of talking about whether the glass is half full or half empty,\" said one participant, \"I prefer to say there is bucket with some water in it but holes about one third of the way up: the holes are the settlements and whatever progress has been made we can't make any more until those holes are plugged.\"</p> <p>So it is good news that leading Israelis are planning a campaign to breathe new life into the Arab peace initiative, advertising the benefits of a comprehensive settlement which consigns the entire conflict to history. Polling shows Israelis no longer believe in Oslo-like incrementalism with a distant goal held hostage to endless process. Improved salesmanship can certainly popularise a good but neglected product.</p> <p>But there will have to be substantial change if there is to be anything for the next US president to work with. \"The Israelis need to show the Arabs that they are prepared to pay a political price to move forward - and that it's not all about tactics,\" warned a senior Arab diplomat. \"No amount of PR will work until there is a meaningful peace process that has some chance of going somewhere.\"</p>",
  "<p>My father-in-law was born in Manchester. After the second world war he came to New Zealand and swore he would never go home. \"Not bloody going back there,\" he always said. From working class northern England to the North Island, and then \u2014 after he'd enticed my mother-in-law out from Manchester \u2014 they bought a car and drove north of Auckland, to what we call the Far North. </p> <p>They drove into unknown territory, she with her vague impractical fear of going anywhere, of all logistics, and he seemingly fearless, ready for any new experience. She held the map, unable to understand what it meant. On a whim, he turned off State Highway 10, on to the wild stretch of the Karikari peninsula. The peninsula road was only a dirt track back then. Here the land is dry and sandy, the sky a great blue bowl over the low hills, the scrub petering out into white sand beaches fringed with pohutukawa and shining flax. They ended up in a tiny settlement called Whatuwhiwhi. </p> <p>Arriving late, they came to the end of a spit of land. The little old car, in the twilight. The sun setting over the enormous bay, currents moving across the surface, the gannets diving into the water like bombs. I can hear the exchange. She: \"George, there's no more road.\" He: \"Well, I'm not bloody going back.\" A Maori couple emerged from a house. George asked if they could camp on the land. The Maori couple were the Rupaperas, Roma and Pawhau. Years later, Roma told me, \"George, he was so handsome. That blond hair . . .\" </p> <p>\"Camp as long as you like,\" the Rupaperas said, and a lifelong connection was formed. </p> <p>The Rupapera family still lives at Whatuwhiwhi, in a series of tiny wooden houses on this piece of beautiful coastline, at the edge of the vast, moving stretch of Doubtless Bay. They and my in-laws are still close friends, and this is where I go every year with my family, to stay in the bach (holiday house) my father-in-law built, on a hillside overlooking the bay. Across the water, in the far distance, you can see the curve of the opposite coast, and at night the line of lights at Mangonui. During the day, the sky changes and changes, every shade of blue, silver, grey. Stingrays glide along the shoreline, and sometimes dolphins cruise near the beaches. The children swim out to hear their strange whistles and watch them frolic (this despite a warning from a local researcher: be careful, far from curing your ills and all that new age stuff, dolphins play rough; they might just as easily pin you to the bottom and whistle jeeringly while you drown). </p> <p>Decades after his first trip to the place, when George died in Auckland, the Rupaperas came down in convoy and announced they were \"taking George home\". They gave him a tangi (Maori funeral) at the Whatuwhiwhi marae. He lay in state, wearing flax blankets. They buried him in their hilltop graveyard, in the Rupapera line. This was a great honour. As a rule, p\u00e3keh\u00e3 (white New Zealanders) are not given a place on that hill. </p> <p>The Karikari peninsula, on the western side of Doubtless Bay, reaches out into the Pacific Ocean. In 1769 James Cook sailed past the entrance to the area and noted briskly, \"doubtless a bay\". At the same time, the French ship of Jean Fran\u00e7ois Marie de Surville was anchored in the bay, and each ship was unaware of the other. The peninsula has about 70km of coastline, and lots of beaches, all beautiful and usually pretty empty. The road in has been tar sealed now, making it much more accessible, but it's still a wild, remote area, full of hidden bays and vast stretches of empty countryside, a place where barrenness turns suddenly into beauty. There is that particular literally ozone-less clarity of the New Zealand light. At night the stars are extraordinary; the children lie on the grass and count satellites moving busily through the points of light. There is strong colour, a sense of being close to and sometimes lashed by the elements: powerful sun, sudden brief rain, striking changes of the light. One day, crossing from one beach to another, I passed from burning sunshine into a premature afternoon, in which the sky was a deep, weird purple. The air became hot and seemed to pack oppressively down; there was rain, thunder, lightning, the full hysterics of a storm \u2014 and 20 minutes later, bright sunshine again. </p> <p>About 10 years ago an American (referred to hereabouts as \"The American\") arrived in the area and set about turning 3,000 acres of land around Whatuwhiwhi into vineyards. He built Carrington Farms, which includes the Karikari Estate vineyard, a golf course and a luxury lodge. This development hasn't diminished the wild feeling of the place, nor has it much affected the life of the inhabitants, beyond turning some of the local Maori into apprentice vintners. The Karikari Winery is built on a hill, with a view out to the white sands of Puheke. It serves lunch, and holds wine-tasting sessions. The locals can't afford any of this luxury, and most stick to Whatuwhiwhi itself, which has a petrol station and shop, and a backpackers' hostel called The Rusty Anchor, which offers horse riding, kayak and scuba hire, and so on. There is a cafe and a takeaway bar. The settlement has no motels, but there's a camping ground, Whatuwhiwhi Holiday Park, which has a few apartments for rent. And you can rent \"bach\" beach shacks. </p> <p>It's possible to hole up for weeks in George's old bach in January, only emerging off the peninsula to drive to Kaitaia, about half an hour away, for supplies. There are the local swimming beaches, Patea and Perehipe, and the rocks below the bach for fishing. Sometimes a Rupapera comes calling, bringing shellfish as a present; sometimes the man from next door gets off his boat with a big snapper for us, which his son delivers in a plastic bag. There is always the smell of cypress and gum trees. The scrubland gets tinder dry. One year the headland caught fire and had to be doused by helicopters with monsoon buckets; we watched, worrying, making plans to run down to the sea if the fire got too close. </p> <p>Some days we take trips, driving around the enormous rim of Doubtless Bay. On the opposite side from Whatuwhiwhi are Cable Bay (with a shop with a large plastic ice cream impaled in its roof like a crashed rocket), Coopers Beach, and then Mangonui, which was once a whaling and trading port, and is now a twee little town with a wharf, restaurants and shops, and the Mangonui Fish Shop, where you can sit looking over the harbour, listen to terrible country and western songs and eat fish and chips. </p> <p>At Patea beach, next to Whatuwhiwhi, I first encountered Roma and Pawhau's son, Bradley Rupapera. He emerged from the bush, where he'd been kipping under a tree. As boys, my husband and Bradley fished, hunted crabs and rode wild horses round the peninsula. Bradley spent a lot of time sleeping outdoors (large family, minimal dwellings). One summer we arrived at the beach to find a crowd. There were relatives staying, and Bradley had been allocated a mattress under a tree above the beach. He'd woken at dawn to see a beached marlin struggling in the shallows. He'd leapt out of bed, fought to catch it, and dragged it on to the sand. It was 6ft long. They were cutting it up. The old people were sitting in chairs; Roma, the matriarch, magnificent in her leopard-skin hat, was directing operations. The cousins had run off to get soy sauce. \"For sushi,\" they said. The sea provides a lot of local food. On the outgoing tide the kids climb down the bush track to the rocks below the bach to catch snapper. The locals use scuba gear to dive for scallops. </p> <p>Sometimes we drive along the road past Carrington Farms to Matai Bay. Matai Bay is actually two symmetrical, crescent-shaped bays side by side, divided by a thin spit of land. It takes a good half hour to walk to the end of one bay. One year we followed a school of dolphins around the crescent, another year we found an octopus in a rock pool. Here there are giant, smooth grey stones as big as cars, strewn about on the sand. The land belongs to local Maori. There are just a few houses, small and flimsy and mounted on makeshift blocks that look like wheels, as if the owners could let off their brakes and trundle them to a different spot. There is a camping ground at Matai Bay, but no other facilities beyond lavatories and bins. In the summer the pohutukawa trees are full of red flowers and the light shines hurtingly bright on the flax. The sea changes; sometimes there are waves enough for body surfing, at other times it's calm and still. In wet weather it's all silence and salty air, space and distance, the rain like metal curtains over the sea. </p> <p>Possibly the favourite trip is to Puheke Reserve. The unsealed road can be rough in summer before it's been graded, a juddering, sliding ride. It winds through scrubland and swamps, leading to Mt Puheke, and the long, white Puheke beach. After a serious scrub fire, a few years ago, Mt Puheke was black (it burned for a day and a night, blazing on the horizon, the flames like mad hair); now it is green again. </p> <p>Puheke is a surf beach, stretching about three miles along the coast. If you walk away from the swimmers, there's nothing ahead of you but the great sweep of the coast, the white sand, and the dunes. At the far end of Puheke, the bend of the coast and the distance hide all evidence of other humans. There is a hillside covered in flax and cabbage trees, and the sea is dark blue, washing against the rocks. In summer, on a hot, clear day, there's a kind of animal satisfaction in walking the length of Puheke beach. There is the wind and sun, the roar of the surf, the effort of walking in the heat and finally, at the end, calm in the shelter of the rocks. Everything registering in ear and eye and body; no need for anything else \u2014 no other meaning outside this. </p> <p>\u2022 Charlotte Grimshaw's short story collection, Opportunity, was shortlisted for the 2007 Frank O'Connor International short story prize.

  "<p>The American economy hits the skids and sends the global financial market reeling. Within two weeks the country has gone from talking about lipsticks on pitbulls and astronomical petrol prices to hyperventilating about the collapse of an entire set of political and economic assumptions, graven in stone these three decades past. This is an enormous and terrifying hinge-moment in American history: belts have been drastically tightened, the bill has come due and the cupboard is bare. The vacuous political class that is supposed to rescue us from all this is utterly discredited, democracy was long ago strangled by political money, the infrastructure is in tatters, and the national debt looks like we inherited it from Brobdingnag and the Land Of The Giants.</p> <p>And in the three-week period during which all this became painfully evident, the biggest movie in America was Beverly Hills Chihuahua - a live-action Disney dogcom in which a pampered, Paris Hilton-friendly pooch (voiced by Drew Barrymore) reconnects with her earthy canine ancestry when she gets lost in Mexico. </p> <p>Is this how empires fall? Shouldn't the greatest, most melancholy and powerful art came out of societies gripped by inexorable decline? There is nothing more evocative of deep and complicated feelings than to witness the passing away of an entire social order, feelings shared equally by those with the greatest stake in the ancien regime and those most anxious to see it all come down. 1848 begat Flaubert's L'Education Sentimentale, India/Pakistan's partition gave us The Jewel In The Crown and Rushdie's Midnight's Children, the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire yielded up the rich landscape of decline and fall outlined for us by Stefan Zweig, Arthur Schnitzler, Robert Musil, Hermann Broch, S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai, Mikl\u00f3s B\u00e1nffy, Gregor von Rezzori and particularly Joseph Roth. And America gives us a bunch of yappy little rat-resembling mutts.</p> <p>I suppose I'm not being fair. The Berlin Wall came down nearly two decades ago and interesting movies about that period and earlier (The Lives Of Others to The Death Of Mr Lazarescu, to name just two) only started arriving recently. The present collapse of all the smelly Friedmanite orthodoxies (which is my Berlin Wall tumbling down - oh joy!) has happened with such dizzying rapidity that clear focus is obviously hard to come by.</p> <p>But what do you suppose was playing at the flicks the night the seas rushed into Atlantis, or as the Lisbon earthquake convulsed the city, or as the Visigoths defiled the palaces of the emperor? The citizens of a declining empire worth the name would be out at the cockfights or the gladiator play-offs while the city burned and the emperor fiddled, or better yet at a orgy, laughing in the face of death. America is supposed to be good at decadence, but judging by Beverly Hills Chihuahua, it's losing its touch on that front. Badly.</p>",
  "<p>She won Sir Paul McCartney's heart with a rendition of the Home and Away theme tune and wowed the judges with a daring medley that combined Special AKA's Free Nelson Mandela with Rihanna's Umbrella. Now, in what might just be the moment that the TV talent show phenomenon eats itself, the winner of a parody of the genre by comedian Peter Kay is beating last year's X Factor victor in the race for the number one slot. </p> <p>Kay's affectionate send-up, The Winner's Song by Geraldine McQueen, an Irish transsexual played by Kay in Channel 4 show Britain's Got the Pop Factor and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice, was last night outselling the new single from Leon Jackson. </p> <p>Both still trailed the current number one, Pink's So What, but record industry insiders said that with the majority of Kay's sales being in traditional physical formats rather than via downloads he should benefit from a late surge in stores today ahead of Sunday's countdown.</p> <p>Jackson's Don't Call This Love, which he performed live on the X Factor last weekend, would ordinarily be expected to sail to the top of the charts. </p> <p>X Factor impresario Simon Cowell and record label Sony BMG had been hoping to follow the template set by Leona Lewis, who waited almost a year to release her second single to coincide with another series of X Factor and had a worldwide hit with Bleeding Love. </p> <p>But Cowell looks set to be scuppered for once by Kay's equally large fanbase, who have been buying Geraldine's triumphant Winner's Song since it closed the show on Sunday night. </p> <p>Written by Take That's Gary Barlow, with its key changes and rousing chorus - \"I started with nothing/Now I have something/I proved them all they were wrong\" - it could easily pass for one of the empowering anthems that traditionally close each series of X Factor and end up as number one at Christmas. </p> <p>Jackson could stall at number three despite the popularity of X Factor, which has been winning Saturday night audiences of more than 11m partly thanks to an extra wave of publicity generated by new judge Cheryl Cole, herself discovered on a Saturday night TV talent show. Britain's Got the Pop Factor, together with a \"results\" programme, was Channel 4's most watched show of the year so far with 5.5m viewers. </p> <p>Alongside McCartney, it featured a string of other celebrity cameos including Pete Waterman, Nikki Chapman and Neil Fox as judges and Cat Deeley as the programme's host. It divided critics, some of whom thought its note perfect recreation of a genre that is increasingly beyond parody, slightly pointless. </p> <p>Sun TV critic Ally Ross argued that Kay's use of the show to sell his single was no less cynical a tactic than that used by the programmes he was attempting to parody, making the show \"a greedy, self-indulgent, not-all-that funny advert for Peter Kay\". </p> <p>But fans have flooded message boards with praise and clips from the programme are already YouTube favourites. </p> <p>Kay has previously been involved with two number one singles in aid of Comic Relief, on the video for Tony Christie's Is This the Way to Amarillo in 2005 and teaming up with The Proclaimers to re-record I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) in 2007.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 There were many strange moments during the judging process for this year's Man Booker prize, but the strangest for me came when I and my fellow judges - Michael Portillo (the chair), James Heneage, Alex Clark and Hardeep Singh Kohli - were having lunch after the longlist meeting. Thanks to Michael's firmness, the decision-making had been quick - 40 minutes to select our favourite 13 books from 116 entries. Before the meeting, he had asked us all to submit our lists of top 10 favourites to him, without collusion. This process produced nine titles that received votes from the majority of the panel - in other words, three judges or more. Michael proposed that those nine had won their places on the longlist without further ado. That left only four places on the list to be debated. </p> <p>The two novels on my personal list that didn't make it were People of the Book by Geraldine Brooks and Late Nights on Air by Elizabeth Hay, both of which I loved, but I had to accept my enthusiasm was not shared. Books in the running for those last four longlist slots were ones that were voted for by one or two judges, but also partially admired by others who had not found room for them in their top 10. One such was Joseph O'Neill's Netherland, which scraped its way on to the longlist despite our shared reservations because of its evocative portrayal of a post-9/11 New York.</p> <p>Netherland was first out of the blocks as bookies' favourite, and in the following weeks its author was splashed all over the papers beneath headlines that declared him \"hotly tipped\" to win. Not by us, he wasn't. The person this was most unfair on was O'Neill, who could have been forgiven for filling his ice box with champagne and rushing his tuxedo down to the dry cleaners. Next up as favourite was Salman Rushdie with The Enchantress of Florence, who had bunny-hopped on to our longlist with ease, only to be excluded from the shortlist four weeks later with equal unanimity. Booker judges snub Rushdie, or similar, was the headline in the papers. No, we didn't. We just thought the six books that did make it were better. </p> <p>I went into the final meeting thinking that, although I would be happy for any one of our top six to take the prize, there were three that had nudged ahead for me, one of which was our eventual winner, Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger. I was also entranced by Sebastian Barry's The Secret Scripture, a beautiful novel about an old lady in an Irish asylum reflecting back on her life. It wasn't that I didn't want The White Tiger to win, just that I didn't want The Secret Scripture to lose. At one point during our discussions, we double-checked with Ion Trewin, the chair of the prize committee, if we could split it. No, we couldn't. In the end, it came to a tense secret ballot and The White Tiger, a superbly executed novel about poverty and corruption in modern India, inched ahead of its competition. At which moment, we all paused to draw breath and blink at each other, suddenly silent after hours of impassioned and, at times, tearful debate.<br><strong>Louise Doughty</strong></p> <p>\u2022 So the government has retreated, for now. Although 42-day detention has been dropped from the counter-terrorism bill, the home secretary has said that the measure will be brought to parliament in a separate piece of legislation \"if needed\". When might that be? At a time when it might seem more effective as a piece of political posturing? None of this is about making us safer. It's about making the government look tougher. And while the current banking crisis meant that it was a good day to bury bad news on the climb-down, it's not too difficult to envisage another day in the future, after another terrorist incident, for example, when the priorities shift back. The government will be there shouting \"we told you so\". </p> <p>It's possible to win the battle and lose the war. We already have provisions for 28-day detention without trial. That is more than twice as long as any other common-law country. Australia has the next longest, at 12 days. That we have already accepted the erosion of habeas corpus - the only true basis of freedom and democracy - to this extent is worrying. More vigilance is required.</p> <p>42 Writers for Liberty: <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/42writers/\">liberty-human-rights.org.uk/42writers/</a><br><strong>Monica Ali</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It is with difficulty that we pardon a man for being both great and illustrious. But we do so even less, if he combines these qualities, for being silent too. In the empire of noise, silence is a crime. The person who refuses to bare himself, to make public pronouncements above and beyond his work, is an annoyance and an obvious target. Milan Kundera has expressed himself fully in his work. He has talked about himself, about his life, in discrete pieces, inhabiting imaginary characters (\"experimental selves\"), examining our human discomfort and trying to discover a way out. He has never given in to the tacit demand that a writer should also be a guide, a philosopher (his essays are so many forms of questioning) a historian, or in a more pernicious way, a man who must justify himself. </p> <p>As an individual, Kundera keeps himself, in solitude, to one side of his work, a fugitive from what he calls \"l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement\": \"What is an '\u00e9v\u00e9nement'? A news item so important that it attracts media attention. Yet a novel is written not to create an \u00e9v\u00e9nement, but to make something which will last.\" </p> <p>And now here is a document, a deposition dating from 1950, the authenticity of which no one is in a position to guarantee, dug up 60 years after the events which it describes and published all over the world, which arrives tragically to impose itself in the form of an \u00e9v\u00e9nement. </p> <p>\"I was totally taken aback by this thing,\" he said, \"which I did not expect at all, which even yesterday I knew nothing of, and which did not take place.\" I am infinitely touched by the awkward turn of phrase which combines in the word thing both the appearance of this police report itself and the act of which he is accused. But nevertheless something has taken place. What has taken place is the irrelevant media frenzy, the ambiguity of certain headlines, the appalling conditional tense (\"may have denounced\"...), even more sly and accusatory than a direct statement, what has taken place is the introduction of doubt, a stain, a shadow which has suddenly been cast over an exceptional life and work. </p> <p>And above all, which is my reason for writing these lines, there is the absolute impotence of a man faced with such a chain of events. He has no possible response. Having made an immediate denial, anything he might say would only feed the process of accusation. In thirty seconds it is possible to sweep away the life of a man with an honest sense of having done one's job and one's duty. No serious inquiry is made, and most often no care in the broadcasting of information which itself is still subject to caution. Words are biassed towards the real. Spoken or written, they take unforeseen paths which can lead to destruction. They must be stopped in time. <br><strong>Yasmina Reza</strong></p> <p>\u2022 \"They don't ban books any more, or at least not recently, which is a relief and a small step forward,\" I wrote in a preface to my latest book on Pakistan, The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power, after explaining how the previous two had been, at different times, banned by military dictators. I was wrong. I had foolishly assumed that since General Musharraf had not banned books, his civilian, supposedly democratic, successors would also stay the course. The Pakistani distributors of my publisher, Simon and Schuster, which had no problems selling ghostwritten volumes by Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto, have for the past four weeks been waiting for \"clearance\" from the ministry of information (ie propaganda) to import my book. The minister, Sherry Rehman, is a former Karachi journalist. Her public embrace of Sarah Palin notwithstanding, she had a reasonable civil liberties record, often preached the virtues of legality, political morality, civic virtues, freedom and equality. They lie now at her feet, broken and scattered shards as the government stumbles from one crisis to another. </p> <p>Her friends tell me she is not responsible for the ban and is trying her best to \"expedite clearance\", but if not her, who? The man at the top these days, President Zardari, is well known as a semi-literate (by choice, unlike the bulk of the country) who has probably never read a whole book in his life. </p> <p>I've received emails from many friends in Pakistan expressing delight: \"what an honour to be banned by Zardari\", \"surely you realise the book will be smuggled in from India\", \"everyone will want to read it now\", etc. My book is being translated into Urdu for publication in November. That edition does not require a clearance, but one can never be too sure in Pakistan. And in case you were wondering, the book is a very sharp critique not just of military dictators, but also of their civilian counterparts, whose corruption knows no bounds.<br><strong>Tariq Ali</strong></p>",
  "<p>French may or may not be \"the most beautiful language in the world\" (Marcel Berlins, G2, October 15), but the reason Rwandans had to speak it in the first place is due to international politics and the outcome of the first world war. In the European carve-up of Africa, Germany acquired Rwanda and Burundi, uniting them as Ruanda-Urundi. Kinyarwanda, itself a beautiful language, still bears witness to that tutelage every time a child goes to \"ishuli\". Germany's defeat in the war left Belgium with territory it had no use for and attempts were made to get the British to negotiate with their Portuguese allies for a slice of the Angolan coast to be added to the Congo. In return the British could have Ruanda-Urundi to be used for the Cape-to-Cairo railway. The British refused to cooperate, the Belgians never got to extend their Congolese coastline and the Rwandans were faced with coping with French and, for a good number of years, Flemish. The Cape-Cairo railway never got built, but negotiations are now in hand for a line from Tanzania to Kigali.<br><strong>Kevin Hartley</strong><br>Stourbridge, West Midlands </p> <p>Marcel Berlins may well regret the global domination of English, but he is wrong to suggest that Rwanda's decision to replace French as its national language was made \"for the sake of a few bucks\". Many Rwandans blame the French for active complicity in the 1994 genocide and the Rwandan government accuses France of granting asylum to extremist Hutus who orchestrated the killings. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been all but nonexistent for over a decade.<br><strong>Joe Philp</strong><br>Oxford</p>",
  "<p>Friends and foes have called Cuba many things - a progressive beacon, a quixotic underdog, an oppressive tyranny - but no one has called it lucky, until now . </p> <p>Mother nature, it emerged this week, appears to have blessed the island with enough oil reserves to vault it into the ranks of energy powers. The government announced there may be more than 20bn barrels of recoverable oil in offshore fields in Cuba's share of the Gulf of Mexico, more than twice the previous estimate.</p> <p>If confirmed, it puts Cuba's reserves on par with those of the US and into the world's top 20. Drilling is expected to start next year by Cuba's state oil company Cubapetroleo, or Cupet.</p> <p>\"It would change their whole equation. The government would have more money and no longer be dependent on foreign oil,\" said Kirby Jones, founder of the Washington-based US-Cuba Trade Association. \"It could join the club of oil exporting nations.\"</p> <p>\"We have more data. I'm almost certain that if they ask for all the data we have, (their estimate) is going to grow considerably,\" said Cupet's exploration manager, Rafael Tenreyro Perez.</p> <p>Havana based its dramatically higher estimate mainly on comparisons with oil output from similar geological structures off the coasts of Mexico and the US. Cuba's undersea geology was \"very similar\" to Mexico's giant Cantarell oil field in the Bay of Campeche, said Tenreyro. </p> <p>A consortium of companies led by Spain's Repsol had tested wells and were expected to begin drilling the first production well in mid-2009, and possibly several more later in the year, he said.</p> <p>Cuba currently produces about 60,000 barrels of oil daily, covering almost half of its needs, and imports the rest from Venezuela in return for Cuban doctors and sports instructors. Even that barter system puts a strain on an impoverished economy in which Cubans earn an average monthly salary of $20. </p> <p>Subsidised grocery staples, health care and education help make ends meet but an old joke - that the three biggest failings of the revolution are breakfast, lunch and dinner - still does the rounds. Last month hardships were compounded by tropical storms that shredded crops and devastated coastal towns.</p> <p>\"This news about the oil reserves could not have come at a better time for the regime,\" said Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a Cuba energy specialist at the University of Nebraska.</p> <p>However there is little prospect of Cuba becoming a communist version of Kuwait. Its oil is more than a mile deep under the ocean and difficult and expensive to extract. The four-decade-old US economic embargo prevents several of Cuba's potential oil partners - notably Brazil, Norway and Spain - from using valuable first-generation technology.</p> <p>\"You're looking at three to five years minimum before any meaningful returns,\" said Benjamin-Alvarado. </p> <p>Even so, Cuba is a master at stretching resources. President Raul Castro, who took over from brother Fidel, has promised to deliver improvements to daily life to shore up the legitimacy of the revolution as it approaches its 50th anniversary.</p> <p>Cuba's unexpected arrival into the big oil league could increase pressure on the next administration to loosen the embargo to let US oil companies participate in the bonanza and reduce US dependency on the middle east, said Jones. \"Up until now the embargo did not really impact on us in a substantive, strategic way. Oil is different. It's something we need and want.\"</p>",
  "<p>Around 30 million shoppers will buy at least some of their Christmas presents online this year - that's twice as many as five years ago. The amount we spend has also been rising dramatically.

  "<h2>Stringy stretchy omelettes</h2> <p>Eggs are obviously sent from heaven for tired parents. Omelettes make great quick dinners, and you can just bung whatever you've got in the fridge into them: peas, ham, onion, mushrooms. Gouda is particularly popular, as it goes stringy when it melts. For some reason, there is nothing as funny, in the whole world, as stringy cheese.</p> <p>According to Elizabeth David, there is one important rule for omelettes : they are the opposite of scrambled eggs in that you cook as fast as humanly possible. In other words, make sure the pan is scalding before you tip in the egg mixture. For cheese omelettes, mix a bit of the cheese into the egg and then tip the rest of the cheese into the centre once the eggs are nearly cooked . For mushroom omelettes, cook the mushrooms in the pan and take them out before you mak e the omelette. Similarly it's worth warming frozen peas through quickly.</p> <h2>Pancakes</h2> <p>You can buy ready-made pancake mix in the shop, or make it yourself. Children love the drama of the whole flipping thing so much, it's quite ridiculous: pancakes for dinner always does feel like a special occasion. Cook up some spinach and stir in some creme fraiche, cheese and salt for a really delicious savoury filling.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>110g plain flour<br>Pinch of salt<br>2 large eggs<br>200ml milk mixed with 75ml water<br>2 tbsp melted butter</p> <p>Sift the flour and water into a mixing bowl, then make a well in the middle and drop the eggs in. Whisk them gently, drawing the flour in as you do so . Start slowly adding the milk/water until it has all been poured in. Whisk until the batter is smooth. Get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down, melt a bit of butter and pour in a ladleful of batter. Flip over when you see bubbles in the batter, and after a few seconds, take out and serve.</p> <h2>Quick veg pie</h2> <p>You need: frozen puff pastry, a beaten egg, some grated cheese and whatever vegetables you have in the fridge. This works particularly well with leeks, broccoli, mushrooms, courgettes. Slice the veg and cook in a bit of melted butter over a very low heat . Then tip out on to one half of the opened out pastry. Sprinkle with grated cheese , paint egg around the edge of the pastry and then fold it over. Paint more egg all over the top and gently snip holes in the pastry to allow it to breath. Cook for 30 minutes at 200C (400F, gas mark 6). </p> <h2>Fajitas</h2> <p>Children love DIY food, and nowhere is it done better than Mexico.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>Flour tortillas<br>Olive oil <br>Onion <br>Mushrooms and garlic (all chopped finely) <br>Red pepper and chicken sliced into long strips <br>Cumin<br>75ml of chicken or veg stock<br>Red peppers<br>Grated cheese<br>Baked beans<br>Slices of avocado<br>Shredded lettuce<br>Tomato sauce.</p> <p>Soften the onions in olive oil, add the mushrooms and then the garlic, then chuck in the red pepper, the chicken and the cumin and fry for a few minutes. Drop the chicken and increase the mushrooms for a delicious vegetarian version. Then add the stock and let it simmer while you heat the baked beans through.</p> <p>If you've got a gas hob the quickest and most tasty way to heat the tortillas is to put them directly on the flame: turn them quickly with tongs or two forks until they're crispy. A bit of blackening just adds to the smoky flavour. Then just let the kids pile what they like in: the joy of making their own dinner often tempts them into adding all sorts of things they wouldn't normally touch.</p> <p>Tip for folding: line the ingredients down from top along the centre, then fold a flap of tortilla up from the bottom. Then wrap the sides over: this stops everything falling out.</p> <h2>Homemade pizza</h2> <p>Pizza is the greatest. And children love making their own - all you need is a base, some kind of sauce and the topping of your choice \u2026</p> <p>There are several techniques, of varying quickness. Quickest of all is to use the readymade bases they sell in the supermarkets (you can also use those flour tortillas which make lovely small crispy pizzas, perfect for everyone to make their own).</p> <p>Or, best of all, you can make the bases from scratch. This involves a lot more time at some point but then you have them in your freezer and just whip them out when needed.</p> <p><strong>Possible toppings<br></strong>Tomato sauce or ketchup<br>Mozzarella and/or cheddar<br>cheese <br>Mushrooms and ham <br>Olives and tuna <br>Peppers from a jar <br>Salmon and creme fraiche</p> <h2>Pasta bake</h2> <p>You can put any old leftovers into this: it's a kind of dustbin of a dinner, except that makes it sound unappetising. Sorry.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>Pasta<br>1 large tbsp flour<br>2 tbsp butter<br>2-3 large handfuls grated cheese (cheddar, parmesan \u2014 you can mix up what you've got)<br>275ml milk<br>Vegetables - courgettes, cabbage, spring onions, beans, peas, carrots, asparagus - whatever you have to hand<br>Breadcrumbs</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190 C (375F, gas mark 5). Cook the pasta and drain . Put the pasta and veg into a baking dish together. Make the cheese sauce: melt the butter with the flour and stir until it forms a paste then slowly stir in the milk (this is slightly easier if the milk is already a little warm), letting it thicken as you do so. Once all the milk is in, take it off the heat and put in half the cheese. Pour it over the pasta and veg, and scatter the rest of the cheese with some breadcrumbs on top. Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes until golden brown.</p> <h2>Sausage and beans</h2> <p>Tell them this is what cowboys have for dinner. Children really seem to fall for that stuff.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>Olive oil<br>Sausages ( 2 per child)<br>1 onion (finely chopped)<br>1 400g can cannellini beans<br>1 400g can tomatoes<br>1 tbsp black treacle or golden<br>syrup or dark brown sugar <br>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce </p> <p>Fry the sausages in the oil in a heavy-based frying pan, then take them out while you cook the onions in the sausage juice until they're golden. Add the beans (rinsed), tomatoes, treacle/syrup/sugar, the Worcestershire sauce and 150ml boiling water. Cook for a few minutes and then put in the sausages and bring to one glorious crescendo!</p> <h2>Beans and pesto</h2> <p>Canned beans are a great base for a quick meal. Adapt some of the pasta sauces to stir in with them, such as that old favourite - pesto and potatoes.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>2 medium potatoes (peeled and diced)<br>2 tins of your favourite beans (perhaps not kidney)<br>A bit less than half of one jar of ready-made pesto, or some of your home-made<br>50g butter<br>1 tbsp olive oil</p> <p>Cook the potatoes and about five minutes before they are done, add the beans, washed of all their tinny juices. Drain and put veg aside. Put the pan back on the heat, mix the butter, olive oil and pesto until it all sizzles, then gently tip back the beans and potatoes and give a stir. Serve up with grated cheese.</p> <h2>Fried fish</h2> <p>We often forget what fast food fish can be, and a fried fillet of white fish - cod, haddock, plaice - is the simplest, quickest way to get it into your children. Just pat both sides of the fish with flour, put some butter in a pan and put the fish in: it takes between five and 10 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillet. You can check by gently pulling it apart: if all the translucency is gone it's done.</p> <h2>Chicken drumsticks</h2> <p>The nicest way to cook drumsticks is to make up a mix of Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and tomato ketchup, plus whatever else you have to hand, and then roll the m in it and stick them into a pan and into the oven for half an hour. You'll need to turn them occasionally.</p> <h2>Lamb keema </h2> <p>This is a really easy way to introduce your child to very mild curry flavours.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>1 tbsp veg oil<br>1 onion<br>2 garlic cloves<br>500g minced lamb<br>1 400g tin tomatoes<br>1/2 tsp mild chilli powder<br>1/2 tsp cumin<br>1 tsp ground coriander seeds<br>1 tsp turmeric<br>200ml coconut milk</p> <p>Heat the oil in a large heavybased saucepan, then put in the onion and cook it quickly, stirring to make sure it doesn't catch, unti l it's translucent. Add the garlic and stir. Put in the mince and stir until it browns. Add the spices, then the tomatoes and coconut milk . Simmer for half an hour, then serve with rice.</p> <h2>Vegetable curry</h2> <p>Incredibly easy, and brilliant way of finishing off the veg in the fridge. Use whatever's to hand, there are very few vegetables that don't thrive in this dish.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>Vegetable oil<br>1 onion or 2 shallots<br>1 garlic clove<br>1 small celeriac<br>2 tbsp mild curry paste<br>A few cardamom pods<br>Assorted vegetables (red or green peppers, potato, sweet potato, pumpkin, cauliflower, courgette, broccoli, green beans, peas, okra - what ever you've got in the fridge \u2026)<br>250 ml greek yoghurt</p> <p>Heat the oil in a pan, then add the onion, garlic and pepper if you're using any. Cook for a minute or two, then add the celeriac and some salt and pepper . Give it a couple of minutes, then add the curry paste, the cardamom and some of your vegetables (you have to use your judgment here: the more solid veg should go in first, while the veg which have more affinity with water and which will just mush away if they're cooked too long go in later, after you've got the whole thing properly bubbling). Stir again and let the vegetables sweat in the curry paste a little, then tip in the tomatoes, add a can full of water, and bring it all the boil. After that add the quickcookers and give the whole thing about 10 minutes, until the veg are tender.</p> <p>Serve with rice, plain yoghurt, and naan heated through. You could also make some lass i : just pour some plain yoghurt into a blender, along with a good splash of milk, a pinch of ground cardamom and cinnamon. Sweeten to taste with caster sugar . You can add fruit too - mango or banana are particularly lovely.</p>",
  "<h2>Make this with your kids: Bread</h2> <p>It takes longer than a bread machine, but the smell of proving dough is just joyful. </p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>21g dried yeast (3 x 7g sachets) or 30g fresh yeast<br>30g honey<br>625ml tepid water<br>1 kilo strong flour<br>30g salt</p> <p>Dissolve the yeast and honey in half the tepid water. In a large bowl, or on a flat surface, make a mound with the sifted flour and salt, and make a well in the middle, then pour the yeast-honey mix in and, either with your fingers or with a plastic spatula, start to mix them (you can do this part in a mixer too, very slowly and gently). </p> <p>Once the first portion is mixed in, add the second portion of water. By now you should have a fairly moist ball of dough which you can then knead for five to 10 minutes. Then put it in a baking tray, cover it with clingfilm or a cloth, and leave it somewhere warm for at least half an hour, probably more, until your ball of dough has doubled in size. </p> <p>Now knead it again, back down to size. Then make up your mind what you want to do with it. If you want to make bread rolls, preheat the oven to 225C (435F, gas mark 7), divide into a dozen balls, leave them to prove again (ie double in size again), and bake them for 10-15 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty rating</strong></p> <p>Quite high. There's a tricky stage with the dough just after you've combined the ingredients and before it's turned into a lovely ball of dough where an adult may need to step in to check that the texture is right. It's also quite a long process.</p> <p><strong>The verdict</strong></p> <p>Yes, yes, yes. Paige rated this one of her favourite dishes, and we tore into the bread rolls with gusto. Kneading the dough was fantastically popular: it was the best kneaded dough of all time, as everyone wanted to have a go. Asa's verdict: \"I love bread\". </p> <h2>Pizza bases </h2> <p>If you want to make pizza bases, follow the recipe for basic bread and then, instead of proving it for a second time, divide the dough into four and roll each ball out into a pizza circle. Stretch the dough as far as you possibly can because the thinner you get it the better. </p> <p>If you want to use one of your bases straight away, put it onto a baking tray, load up with ingredients as you wish, and cook, as hot as you can get the oven. If you want to freeze the others, give them five minutes each in the oven and then put in the freezer: you can cook them straight out of the freezer and they're so good.</p> <h2>Nigella's easy buttermilk cake</h2> <p>This cake is ideal for any birthday cake you want to make in a special mould - it holds its shape brilliantly.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>250g plain flour<br>1 \u00bd tsp baking powder<br>\u00bd tsp bicarb of soda<br>\u00bd tsp salt<br>200ml buttermilk (or 75g yoghurt mixed with 125ml semi-skinned milk)<br>1\u00bd tsps vanilla essence<br>125g soft butter<br>200g caster sugar<br>3 large eggs</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C (355F, gas mark 4), and line a 23cm square cake tin. Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarb and salt together. Pour the buttermilk (or yogurt mix) into a measuring jug and add in the vanilla. Cream the butter and sugar together, and then add the eggs one at a time. Then add a bit of the flour and then a bit of the buttermilk, one after the other, until it's all mixed in together. Pour into the tin and bake for 40 minutes.</p> <h2>Fairy cakes</h2> <p>These cakes are really easy to make from scratch, and taste a million times better than those ready-made batches which are so weirdly synthetic.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>125g self-raising flour<br>125g soft butter<br>125g caster sugar<br>1 tsp baking powder<br>2 eggs<br>1 tsp vanilla essence</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C (375F, gas mark 5) and put cake cases into a bun tin: this usually makes about 20 or so. Sift the flour and baking powder together, and then pour everything else in and beat until it's creamy: when it drops off the spoon with a fat dollop, the mix is ready. Put a spoonful of mix into each case and bake for about 20 minutes. Children love icing these, so if you're feeling indulgent make up some batches of icing for them and put out a selection of silver balls, hundreds and thousands, smarties and chocolate buttons. It's a cheap way to be the most popular parent for at least half an hour.</p> <h2>Nigella's jam doughnut muffins</h2> <p>Sticky fingers, sticky everything, these are an indulgent treat.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>125ml milk<br>85ml corn or other veg oil<br>1 large egg<br>\u00bd tsp of vanilla extract<br>200g self-raising flour<br>100g caster sugar<br>12 tsps strawberry jam<br>100 unsalted butter<br>150g granulated sugar</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C (375F, gas mark 5), and oil a muffin tin to within an inch of its life. Then beat together the milk, oil, egg and vanilla extract and very, very gently fold the mixture into the flour and caster sugar. Nigella says you don't need to worry about lumps: \"If you overbeat, the muffins will be tough\". Put a spoonful of mixture into each cup and then a teaspoonful of jam, and then another spoonful of mix. Put into the oven and cook for about 20 minutes until gloriously risen. Then (this is where it starts to slip into farcical levels of Nigella-ness) melt some butter and put the granulated sugar onto a plate. Roll the muffins in the butter and then in the sugar. Absurd but delicious.</p> <h2>Marmalade buns</h2> <p>Fragrant little cakes from Jane Brocket's mouth-watering book Cherry Cake and Ginger Beer.</p> <p><strong>For the dough</strong><br>175g butter<br>175g soft brown sugar<br>3 eggs<br>Grated zest of 1 unwaxed orange<br>Juice of \u00bd orange<br>2 large tbsp thin-cut marmalade<br>175g self-raising flour</p> <p><strong>For the icing</strong><br>200g icing sugar<br>Juice of 1 orange</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C (355F, gas mark 4). In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one by one and mix well. Add the orange zest, orange juice, marmalade and stir. Then gently fold in the flour. Divide the mix between 12 paper cases in a bun tin and bake for about 20 minutes. Leave to cool. Mix the orange juice slowly into the icing sugar until you get the right consistency and ice the cakes.</p> <h2>Cinnamon rolls</h2> <p>A slightly adapted version of Tessa Kiros' cinnamon rolls:</p> <p><strong>For the dough</strong><br>250ml tepid milk<br>100g golden caster sugar<br>3 x 7g sachets dried yeast, or 25g fresh yeast<br>1 egg<br>125g soft butter<br>1 tsp salt<br>650g plain flour</p> <p><strong>For the cinnamon butter</strong><br>2 tsp cinnamon<br>50g golden caster sugar<br>80g soft butter</p> <p>Mix the milk and 100g of the sugar with the yeast: give it 10 minutes to activate. Then add in one of the eggs, the butter and the salt and mix. Sift in the flour, stirring until it begins to hold together, then turn it out onto a floured surface and knead until soft. Put it back into the bowl, cover and leave in a warm place to prove for a couple of hours.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C (355F, gas mark 4). Make the filling by mixing together the cinnamon and the sugar. When risen, roll out the dough and cut into four. Roll out one piece of dough at a time into a nearly square rectangle about 25cm by 30cm, then sprinkle with the cinnamon filling. Roll into a sausage, and cut into fat little V-shapes alternating up and down, and one by one push your fingers right into the middle of the little V so the sides squeeze out a little bit. Bake on a baking tray for about 20 minutes.</p> <h2>Straightforward cake</h2> <p>Given that baking always seems to involve measurements that can tilt out of kilter on a second's dithering, this cake is a relief.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>An equal weight of eggs, butter, sugar, and self-raising flour<br>(start by weighing the eggs in their shells, and then follow on...)<br>Flavouring of your choice<br>(lemon rind, cocoa powder ...)</p> <p>Preheat oven to190C (375F, gas mark 5). Butter a cake tin or get out paper cases if you're going to make baby cakes. Then whip the butter and sugar until fluffy and then add the eggs, one at a time. Finally gently fold in the flour and flavouring, and put the mix into the tin or cases before you slide it into the oven. You'll need about 10-15 minutes for mini-cakes, or just over half an hour for the cake.</p>",

But if they come here, they would be surprised to see that a man as well can do the same thing.\"</p> <h2>Liberia</h2> <p><strong>Johnette, 16, Northampton</strong></p> <p>\"It all started with the war. I was coming home from school one day and I saw people running about, going crazy. I went down to the bus stop but there were no spaces on the bus; people started fighting, so I decided to walk. To my house was about two hours. I was crying and scared because people were shoving each other, trying to get to safety, so I decided to run. Luckily my mum was coming up the road and she saw me and we went home. We sat down in the house and the shooting ceased. </p> <p>\"A day passed and there was no shooting, so everyone calmed down again and started living normally. But then it all started again. It got worse. Each time someone would come saying, 'The people are getting closer.' Meaning the rebels. So my mum, she was scared but she started acting brave because she didn't want us to be scared. She said: 'We have to stay here because we've nowhere to go. God will protect us.' She's a very strong Christian. Luckily for us her boyfriend came and took us to this place in town. On our way we had things on our head, bundles, and this bullet just missed me and my mum screamed.</p> <p>\"We finally got there and there were so many people in one building. It was well dirty. There was one bathroom for everyone, so it was filthy: disgusting sewage and flies everywhere. Everyone was crowded up in this tiny room, crouching up and praying in the night. Some people would be crying and you'd hear babies screaming.</p> <p>\"During the day, there was a little market outside the fence. My mum would go and buy some stuff. Sometimes she didn't find anything much but she didn't eat and gave us the food instead. </p> <p>\"We were there for a long time and there was loud gun sound everywhere. You could hear rockets dropping next to the American embassy because we were near there in this place called Graystone, where lots of refugees were. My mum said, 'Oh, thank God.' Not that it's nice they were dropping there; she was thanking God they didn't drop where we were. Mum said so many people were dying.</p> <p>\"That war finished and we started moving out. People called it world war one. But then there was world war two, like a replay of everything that happened before. One day a lady went out to get some food and a rocket dropped and she died, outside the house. </p> <p>\"The war ceased and my dad said he was sending for me. I didn't want to go, didn't want to leave my mum - I didn't even know my dad. My uncle said, 'Any child would kill to get this opportunity [to go to England] and you're refusing it? You're going!'</p> <p>\"When I first came here it was cold and I refused to get in the elevator. I started screaming when I was in it. In Africa you get kids everywhere and it's not hard to make friends. In England, look outside: you can't see no one. </p> <p>\"I went back to Liberia last August. It was the best time ever. I didn't want to come back. But what I realised is when I was in Liberia, you don't know nothing. When I was in Liberia I thought people in England float - that they have floating cars and everything. Because I saw a plane and it was in the air, so I thought English people were always in the air. I only saw white people in books. </p> <p>\"I'm way Christian and the war in Liberia made my belief even stronger. When the bullet passed right beside my ears... I always went to church, but from that moment I actually believed in God.\"</p> <h2>Tunisia</h2> <p><strong>Sarah, 13, London</strong></p> <p>\"Wearing the veil, I do get quite a lot of discrimination. I went on this ferry to the Isle of Wight. And when they say Isle of Wight, they don't lie - all white people. I was wearing my scarf, and I asked the man on the ferry could I have a tissue and he said, 'Why can't you use your scarf?' We got the captain involved. I saw the man shaking and I goes to him, 'You're shaking because you know you're lying' and he goes, 'No, it's not me, it's the boat, I promise you I'm not shaking.' I really hate it when people lie.</p> <p>\"When I am older, I want to be a lawyer and work in discrimination with Muslim people. Not just Muslim people, people from different religions who feel their religion's getting discriminated. Some people commit suicide because of that. Especially bullying. I know some people, they bully this person because they're from Pakistan and they're Muslim. And they say, 'Oh, you wash in curry instead of shampoo.' When they're born, I bet every parent wants their child to grow up polite, clever, nice and kind to everyone else. Racism isn't nice. Discrimination isn't nice. I don't think anyone likes it. But some people do it for fun. Some people hurt other people because they've been hurt. So maybe that's why they do it.\"</p> <h2>Guatemala </h2> <p><strong>Aura, 9, Oxford</strong></p> <p>\"I was about two or three months old when I came from Guatemala. My actual parents couldn't look after me because I was their seventh child, so I went to an orphanage. My parents now were looking for another child to adopt, and then they saw a picture of me. My mum is half Swedish and half Icelandic, and my dad's English. All I know of Guatemala is that I was born in the mountains and I had brothers and sisters. If I was in Guatemala now, I would probably be making those bracelets or working in fields.</p> <p>\"I have a life book [my parents made] about when I was little. It has my birth certificate, a picture of me when I was really little in the orphanage that my parents saw. A picture of my mum when she collected me. And my ticket for when I went back to England. And there is a picture of me when I first came home. And they just welcomed me home. </p> <p>\"There is a poem my mum wrote:</p> <p>Not flesh of my flesh <br>nor bone of my bone <br>but still miracles, my own. <br>Never forget for a single minute, <br>you didn't grow under my heart but in it.\"</p> <h2>Colombia</h2> <p><strong>Marcella, 13, London</strong></p> <p>\"I was seven when I came to live in London. I came because there was a war in Colombia and my mum was scared that something might happen to the family. My dad worked at a car park and Mum worked in medicine. It was really hard for them to leave because my mum, she got the opportunity to become a doctor and that was her dream. She wanted to do that so badly, but unfortunately we had to come. Over here my mum cleans houses and my dad's a manager. He tells people where to clean.</p> <p>\"All our friends are Colombians. We Colombians like to dance a lot, and whenever we start to dance the neighbours downstairs complain and we have to take off our shoes. We Colombians like to have a lot of fun.</p> <p>\"There's a lot [I miss about Colombia]: my family, my grandma, my grandad. For breakfast this morning I had hot chocolate, which is a special Colombian thing. Chocolate in Colombia is really nice. It's better actually than here. [Over there, they eat chocolate] in the morning, in the afternoon, at night, whenever they feel like it. Oh yeah, we eat a lot. Colombians eat triple of what the English people would eat, but they [also] like to keep their body in shape. To be honest, ladies in Colombia have a lot of operations to look good. I saw one, she was, like, 50 and she had an operation. You can see the surgery just by looking at the face. She looked very fake. But she looked nice. </p> <p>\"We went back to Colombia in December when there are special parties. They start at six and finish any time you want to go. We stayed up with my mum, my dad, my cousin and my auntie until about five in the morning. Where we go, it's kind of dangerous because if they know that you come from England and have money, they may rob you or call your parents or family and ask for lots of money. So I was scared. I never spoke English. Only with my family because I didn't want to be talking to a stranger and then the stranger tells a person and then something happens to the family. I couldn't let that happen.\"</p> <h2>Bolivia</h2> <p><strong>Natalie, 10, London</strong></p> <p>\"I've been living in London for nearly three years. [When I started school] I didn't know many words. I'd be speechless, as though I couldn't speak. But then, as soon as I entered class, there was a girl who spoke Spanish. So I got to learn from her. </p> <p>\"In Bolivia my grandma had one maid, my mum had a maid and some other family members had maids. We don't have a maid in London. Before, my mum and the maid helped in cleaning the house, cooking the food, all this stuff, so now we all have to work as a team to finish the work.</p> <p>\"In Bolivia the situation got really bad so we needed to go. We flew to Santa Cruz and on the way we had to take a taxi and go up mountains until we got to the airport. Our maid, me and my sister, my dad and my brother were all coming. We had to leave because there was this prime minister for the people that aren't so wealthy, [who] started to get angry and wanted him in power, so started to cause trouble... it got quite scary.</p> <p>\"I miss my family in Bolivia. I can see them [on] Skype, but I can't see them properly, like you're holding their hands and stuff like that, because you're not that near to them. You're across seas.\"</p> <h2>Bahrain</h2> <p><strong>Amna, 15, London</strong></p> <p>\"There aren't as many arranged marriages in Bahrain as there used to be. Before, there was less choice, but now you see men marrying people that aren't even from their distant family. Because I'm in the royal family, we have to ask the king if the man I want to marry is OK, because he would have to see if he's a good guy. There's probably 2,000 people in the royal family, and they live all over the place. I travel a lot: I've lived in Bahrain for four years, and before that Washington DC for 11 years. In my opinion, anyone who hasn't travelled would have a narrow mind and not really a big imagination as to what is really out there. </p> <p>\"Creating a home is, of course, mostly about who you're with. My dad's the ambassador, and our house is a town house with seven floors. It has a basement. It has an elevator, thank God. And it's mostly Victorian - it's got pictures and paintings of people I've never known before and a bunch of books that I don't think anyone reads but are nice to look at, I guess. </p> <p>\"Here in London they have this rule that you can't really change windows, especially in this part of London, because they want it how it's supposed to look - how it originated. In Bahrain everyone has different architecture and new styles. When I get older I would like to live in ... I was going to say Bahrain, but I don't really know what it's turning into. It's more of a competition between Bahrain and Dubai to see who can build faster, and I'm not sure I want to be part of that. Nowadays, Bahrain is very westernised and any girl that's watched movies wants to be like an American girl or a London girl and go shopping. They're very materialistic. That's why I feel really lucky and grateful that I haven't lived there my whole life - so I know exactly what I'm missing out on. I know what I could have been and what I'm not.</p> <p>\"My school's really friendly. It's easy to find somebody in common because of the diversity of the people and the nationalities. People are accepting within this whole city. I guess because everyone moves in and out of here, and it's filled with people from all sorts of places. Just walking down the street to Starbucks, I see different people, hear different languages. I even hear Arabic a lot around this area and it makes me feel that I'm still connected with my culture, and at the same time I'm learning about other cultures. I mean, you're doing this project now on kids that are from all over the world, so that has to prove something.\"</p> <h2>Macedonia</h2> <p><strong>Sara, 12, London</strong></p> <p>\"English children need to learn to be more free, to go out, to be more kid-like. Because sometimes I get kind of tired of shopping because it's a bit grown up. I still want to live the life of a little child, play hide-and-seek, and stuff like that.\"</p> <h2>Ghana</h2> <p><strong>Kwame, 16, Leeds</strong></p> <p>\"When I got to school here, I didn't know no one. I'd just sit there and watch the teacher. I didn't do no work, because he'd speak fast and all I could hear was some teacher talking. Things turned around when I met some guy who was born here but from Ghana. He couldn't speak my language, but he could understand it. I got lost on my first day at school and on the second day as well. I got lost many times. So in the morning I would wait for him outside school and he would take me to my classes because I was proper confused - in Ghana everything is in the same class. In the morning I'd follow him wherever he goes. I used to be his little slave or something. Now, I have very good friends. I know everyone in Leeds I would say. If I see people standing I just go and start talking. I'm just popular.</p> <p>\"When you go back to Ghana people respect you because you've been in a higher place than them. People will greet you and they expect you to be rich. In some ways I am different from other teenagers in Ghana. I've been in UK, you haven't - you're in Ghana. I've known better English - you haven't, you're still learning the same English I was learning. I've been in better places - you haven't, you stayed in Ghana. Even though we are the same, the same background, the only difference is I've been in a better place - you haven't.</p> <p>\"When I'm older I would like to be a doctor. I'm about to finish my GCSE Science. My predicted grade is B. If I could wish for anything I wish to get better grades, go to a better college and be the doctor I want to be. I will work in Ghana. In Ghana, people suffer from diseases. They don't know the right diet to eat and I just want to help my people. We need proper, qualified doctors there. Always people are getting sick, getting disease of water or food contamination. All I can say is, I want Ghana to improve. I want Ghana to have the best freedom and the best schools as here and all the equipment in hospitals needed.</p> <p>\"I really thank my dad and my mum for giving me a better life, for bringing me here to have the best I can have.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Kwame died suddenly on May 15 this year, from meningitis. A teacher at his school said that every day Kwame asked him when he was going to be in the magazine and be famous.</em></p> <h2>China </h2> <p><strong>Zifan (aka Fan), 16, Cardiff</strong></p> <p>\"[When I first came to the UK] I just want to stay home because I can't do nothing and I can't speak English. On my first school day I was looking for friends - I want someone to help me, I feel scared about everything. I've got lots [now], from Pakistan, Oman, Nepal, the UK and one from China. </p> <p>\"I come from near Beijing. A very good place, very beautiful. Since I've been here I've heard lots about the Olympics - that's why I couldn't go back this holiday: there are so many people in Beijing. Lots of people ask: why your father only got you, no sister, no brother? I told them in China it's just like that because they've got a lot of people. </p> <p>\"I ate pizza for the first time here. I like it because it got so much meat and everything. I still eat it, but not too much. I never eat lunch when I go to school. I don't eat breakfast. I want to get skinny. If I'm not skinny, I'll be fat. If I'm fat, everyone will say I'm panda. People say that to me because we're seeing a new movie, [Kung Fu] Panda. And when they see [it], they say I'm panda. If I was in China, I wouldn't mind because it's, like, best animal of China, of the world. If they say you're panda, that means you're very good.\"</p> <h2>Bosnia </h2> <p><strong>Melita, 15, Derby</strong></p> <p>\"I don't tend to ask my mum a lot about the war, because I know it's a painful experience for her to think back and it's quite hard for us to listen to as well, because what my parents saw is something people should never have to see. In 1992, it came to our village. Our house had just been finished - it had taken my parents three years to save up and make it all nice and Bosnian and proper, and then the Serb soldiers came, and my dad just watched it go up in flames. Most of the men got killed, and the women and children were moved out. They took us away in big army trucks. We just went from place to place. We were in a concentration camp at one point. Some people they decided to kill and some they decided to let live. Luckily, we were allowed to live. Then we got moved over into Croatia. My dad joined us there just after I'd been born. From my dad's side, I lost two uncles, one uncle's wife and three sons. And from my mum's I lost one uncle, and several cousins from both sides - one of them thought they were going to a place where they would be safe, but it was a trap and they got killed, because it was just easier to get rid of them all than send them across.</p> <p>\"At first we were planning on going to Germany - I had an auntie there - but we got rejected. We'd heard that England was accepting people, and I've got family in England, so Dad decided we apply. Luckily they accepted us. A couple of years back we got our citizenship, [so] we can stay here for ever. That was a great moment, because my parents had worried for so long that we'd be sent back. I have an uncle that went to Germany but then got sent back to Bosnia. </p> <p>\"In Derby there are quite a lot of Bosnians. I know a couple of people that are half Serbian, like their dad's Bosnian but their mum's Serbian. But most people get on now, because they're not to blame - it was the army doing it.</p> <p>\"At first we weren't accepted. It was mainly teenage kids - they were bored and it was easier to pick on the foreigners than on someone English. It was mainly throwing stones and eggs, and we had our windows broken a few times. [One time]we had two guys wanting to fight my dad. He's never done anything wrong to these people and he didn't understand why they were doing this. But it was his job to protect his family, and he called the police. They asked if we wanted to press charges but these lads were quite young and their mum was there. He thought, 'How would I feel if it were my sons?' But maybe it would have been better if he had. It came to the point when we had to have a security camera installed. When you're a child, you feel, 'What's wrong with me? Why are they doing this?' But as we grew up, we've come to accept it. We're different and we're proud to be different. I'm proud to be where I'm from. It's something I'll never hide.</p> <p>\"I've been back [to Bosnia] four times since 2004 and I love it. It's true what they say, that you do know where you're from, coz my heart belongs over there. It's not just a holiday when we go back because you see all your family - everyone comes back from all the different countries where they live. I've got family in Scotland, family in Finland, a lot in Germany, France, all over the world. If I'd grown up [in Bosnia], there would have been less employment opportunities for me. It was better back then, because obviously after the war everything was ruined, but even back then there wasn't a lot. Girls would get married at 18, 19, have children and then be housewives and look after the sheep and cows. A lot of men couldn't find a job. </p> <p>\"When people hear that I am a Muslim, it's weird for them, because apart from my name they don't have a clue that I'm foreign at all. I sound like a normal Derby person, and my family have never been strict about making us wear a headscarf, so we seem normal. We're celebrating Eid this evening, so we've got a nice big meal. Bosnians like their big meals. Bosnian food is great. When we first came to England it was the only stuff we made - pastry, potatoes, meat. My parents do eat English food now, though, ever since we got them into kebabs, fish and chips and stuff. It gives my mum a rest from cooking, so sometimes we'll get a takeaway. Mum also likes making curries now.</p> <p>\"I've gotten so used to English culture. It's just normal. Our parents used to be dead strict, because you hear these stories about children getting killed, but as we've grown up they've got used to letting us out and if, like, we need dropping off, my dad's always there to drive us.</p> <p>\"I love to read. I love really sad stories about abuse and things - I find it interesting how someone can get through all that and come out stronger. I've read a couple of really good autobiographies ... Peter Kay - legend! I love funny books, too. Anything, to be honest. </p> <p>\"When I am older, I'd like to study law at Oxford, but we all know how hard it is to get there. I like the idea of family law - helping people if there's been domestic violence, things like that. I like the fact that you can put someone away if they've done something wrong. If I get married, I know my parents want a Bosnian. When they were growing up, it was always Bosnians for Bosnians, and they'd just like us to keep our culture. In a way I would like that [too], because I would love the fact that my child could be whole, one thing, totally Bosnian. But you don't know, do you, with there being so many cultures here and so many religions? At the end of the day, you fall in love with whoever you fall in love with.</p> <p>\"I'd like to go back to Bosnia when I'm really old, because I'd like to die there so I can be buried in my own country. Apart from that, I don't think anyone would want to go back really.\"</p> <h2>Egypt</h2> <p><strong>Nadine, 6, Cardiff</strong></p> <p>\"I have brown eyes and I have one tooth missing. I have, well, sometimes I have red hair - this bit and this bit - and I have brown hair and black hair. I have a mark and I have some earrings. I look stupid because I'm black - I'm disgusting, you know? I look like a snail. I don't like myself. And my tongue is red.\"</p> <h2>Ivory Coast</h2> <p><strong>Inza, 15, London</strong></p> <p>\"When my parents were telling me, Inza, you're coming to England, I was so excited: I thought England was going to be some big thing for me, I thought England was going to be paradise, but it's just a little country, it's a normal country like every country in the world. The houses are nice and everything, but there's no big difference. What I mean is, I met the same black people here as in Africa ... there are more black people here [in Brixton] than white people. </p> <p>\"In Abidjan where I lived, I knew all the people down there, so there ain't nothing going to happen to me. In Africa, if you see anyone walking around, you just say hello. But in England if you see anyone and say hello, they will not say hello back. They have to get to know you properly. When I arrived here I was saying hello to everybody but they wasn't answering me back so I stopped. I tell myself there's no big deal me saying it again. </p> <p>\"Here, age 12, you're already in a gang ... and age 15 you're already making a crime. But I'm 15 and I am not doing that stuff. Mum raised me properly. All I do on the weekends is wake up in the mornings, clean the house quick and go and play football. I miss the free life in Africa. Over there I can go out at six o'clock in the morning and I can come back at one o'clock in the night. Safe, safe, nothing going to happen to me. Here ... already at seven o'clock it's getting dark and if you go out somewhere that your parents don't know ... even if they do know, you can get stabbed on the bus. Too much crime on the streets here. </p> <p>\"I feel happy to be with my parents but I don't feel at home here in England. In the future I want to get some money, go back to Africa, build a big building for all my family to live in. That's my hope. Take my family out of trouble and have a happy ending. If I met other young people in Africa who wanted to get out and come here I'd say, well, true to say in England there's a lot of money. In Africa there's not a lot of money. Maybe that's the only thing I can say you can move to England for. But if I was you I would stay here, coz it's a lot more fun. That's what I would say to them. England is boring, no fun at all.\"</p> <h2>Sudan</h2> <p><strong>Emmanuel, 13, Bolton<br></strong><br>\"We had to leave my village because there was problem of war, so we decided to escape. When we used to stay at school studying [in the refugee camp], we might hear rebels. They're everywhere ... we have to run to find a place to hide. If you want to run to the bush, you run there and hide, to save yourself. If you want to run home, you run home. Sometimes you go in your bed. You don't know if they're outside ... and if they find you, they'll take you in the bush. Sometimes they might make you join their army. And they usually come at dark because nobody can see them coming.\"</p> <h2>Bhutan </h2> <p><strong>Trishala, 14, Huddersfield</strong></p> <p>\"We came from Thimphu in 2000. The Bhutanese weren't getting treated right, so they wanted to get away. My parents had to wear this special uniform. One night, Dad was walking the dog and he didn't have it on. The police put him in jail for the night. Here the fear is the crime, in Bhutan it's the police.</p> <p>\"I don't know about Bhutanese things. I remember it's hilly. And the kids have chinky eyes type. People who don't know me think I'm Chinese. </p> <p>\"My dad wants me to be a doctor. I wouldn't mind that. But I also have my eye on being a fashion designer, living in New York or Boston. </p> <p>\"If I was living in Bhutan I probably wouldn't be as confident as I am. There the girls help their mum with the cooking and cleaning. Here I've been doing tae kwon do for three years and I've got best Northern British Championship. I've got medals from school for netball and badminton. And for football I got player of the match five times and a special award for playing football in the boys' team because they couldn't get anyone else. And I got selected to go to Huddersfield Town and Leeds girls' football teams. I've done majorettes, tap dance, ballet, street dancing, ice skating...\"</p> <h2>Austria </h2> <p><strong>Paul, 13, Richmond, Surrey</strong></p> <p>\"I've been living in the UK for four years now. We came for my dad's work - he's an investment banker. I lived in a small town in Austria. I miss the mountains there because in the winter you can do skiing and ice skating. London is much bigger and it's not as relaxed. You've always got to be guarded by your parents and we have to phone them to tell them where we are and what we are doing. In Austria you can go wherever you want. We might - I don't think so - but we might get kidnapped, or maybe car drivers drive over us, or something like that.\" </p> <h2>Canada</h2> <p><strong>Eve, 8, London</strong></p> <p>\"I came here in 2004 because of Daddy's work. He went back to Canada [but we stayed], because Mummy had a boyfriend and I have school, so I want to stay. Cos my dad moved this year, I'm going to go back more often. I'm going on my own for Christmas. I'm really excited. I miss him.</p> <p>\"In Canada I had waffles and pancakes and cereal for breakfast. Here they have more salty stuff like egg and butter. Canadian people have bigger teeth and most English people have darker hair. If I could wish for anything, I would wish for my dad to come back. And to fly.\" </p> <h2>Lesotho</h2> <p><strong>Mosetse, 16, London</strong></p> <p>\"In Lesotho the majority of kids in orphanages is due to parents dying of HIV. A cousin of mine died of HIV in 2004. It's painful cos when someone is deteriorating like that, you're helpless. I think it's got worse since I left. I remember in school learning that the population is 2 million and now it's a million or something. People have died due to HIV and poverty. Prince Harry went to Lesotho and he was talking about a young girl who got raped by an HIV-positive man. And she got infected and that was very painful. If I could wish for anything, I'd wish for a cure for HIV.\"</p> <h2>Iceland</h2> <p><strong>Thorunn, 13, London</strong></p> <p>\"Iceland is a small country, so there's more freedom there. I could go anywhere in Iceland without my parents worrying. I miss that.</p> <p>\"I know a lot about the climate crisis - in Iceland they're doing [a lot of things] to prevent it. We heat our houses with hot water, not electricity, but I guess that's more of a natural resource - hot water comes from the earth there. In Iceland it's popular to wear wool sweaters, but if someone [came] to my school wearing one, people would think that weird. Also, the food is very different. When you say it out loud, I guess it sounds nasty. There's a snack that is basically a dried fish - it smells horrible, but most Icelandic people love it. Once I was on a school trip and I had a bit with me. After a few minutes one of the girls said, \"What is that smell?\" They were grossed out.\"</p> <h2>Angola</h2> <p><strong>Caterina, 14, Leeds</strong></p> <p>\"In Angola you got a lot people living in a house, innit, and you can walk barefoot. I miss people having a laugh. There's many festivals, people dressed up, enjoying themselves and partying -until 6am - when you party, you sleep outside. Here, when it's cold, you stay in and get bored. There you got things to do. Even if it's raining, you can just play in the rain, because it's not cold. </p> <p>\"Angola is a lovely place, I just wish people from England would feel free to go there, instead of thinking we gonna starve. I want to let people know that in Africa there is actually food and we actually eat, and we're healthy. It's a bit annoying when people always show the bad part of Africa on TV. Like, some people actually cry, saying, 'Oh, children need water.' Not all parts of Africa are poor. There are rich ones that are proper nice.\"</p> <h2>Poland</h2> <p><strong>Izabel, 7, Windsor</strong></p> <p>\"I came from Poland a year ago. When it's summer [in Poland] it's very hot. And in winter it's quite cold and lots of snow goes up to your legs. </p> <p>\"First I came on a bus for a visit, for a week. Afterwards I went in a car, drove from Poland. [When Mum has her baby] my granny's going to come and look after me and the baby, and afterwards my auntie and little cousin's going to come. Then maybe my whole family's going to come. </p> <p>\"Polish people look very different. Some have a rash and spots on their face - disgusting. And Polish people's skin is sort of a whiteish colour.\"</p> <h2>Togo</h2> <p><strong>Larissa, 16, London</strong></p> <p>\"I don't think I would ever be able to live back in Togo. It's actually quite hard to live there. We basically have to change the way we eat depending on the seasons. What you would normally eat became expensive when there was a shortage of food. But here it's not like that - you can eat whatever you want, whenever you want. </p> <p>\"The first thing I noticed about here was that the air was so much cleaner - in Togo there's a lot of dust and plastic bags. News reports were also really different. Normally, in Togo, the news report was just one person sitting there telling you about what happens in the country. It was really... subjective. But the news here is pretty much objective. You just have to work it out for yourself - they don't tell you how to think about it.\"</p> <h2>Afghanistan </h2> <p><strong>Sara, 10, Manchester</strong></p> <p>\"I came here to get educated, because [at home] the schools weren't good, and because of the war - my uncle was killed by the Taliban. It's a small country and really hot. [My dad] came [to the UK] to see if we can visit. He's a teacher: he travels to people's houses to revise the Holy Qur'an. </p> <p>\"At home I don't wear trousers with a T-shirt. It's not in the Islamic way. There have been times when I wanted to wear short skirts, with tights under, but I'm not allowed. Skirts should be rainbowy colours. I don't want just boring black or grey or white. </p> <p>\"When I come [home] from school, I pray and read the Qur'an, then watch TV. We always watch Pakistan news - a channel called Geo. Most of the time there's wars, but sometimes there's happiness, because when American soldiers are killed, they celebrate - they don't fight our country again.'</p> <h2>Uzbekistan</h2> <p><strong>Shereen, 8, Orpington</strong></p> <p>\"My mum and dad work for the BBC. They were journalists in Uzbekistan but they were also very famous and a bit rich actually. At school I like maths. It's fun and makes you kind of clever. But when I'm older I'd like to be an author or a poetress, like JK Rowling, because I could live like a celebrity. This is a poem I wrote, Hopping Spring:</p> <p>Hopping spring, hopping spring<br>Let all the bunnies bounce<br>The trees wailing like the sun<br>And the postman is mailing all the letters<br>Let's hop and hop like a rabbit<br>Let's plant some pots in the teapot<br>Let's enjoy the breeze as it goes past the pots as we eat jelly tots</p> <p>\"I wrote it in wintertime because I was excited about spring, imagining how it would be like.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/interactive/2008/oct/18/children-britain-world\">Interactive: meet children from all 193 countries</a></p>",
  "<p>The unsolved 1996 murder of six-year-old beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey remains one of the most bizarre episodes in American crime. It is a mystery that has deepened with the recent death of JonBenet's mother and DNA tests that exonerate the parents. Police incompetence, family secrets, a little girl dolled up to appear dangerously mature - the whole episode has always smacked more of fiction than the real world.</p> <p>Joyce Carol Oates straddles this blurred line between reality and make-believe in her sprawling new novel. The eponymous hero, Skyler Rampike, is not, as you might expect, the murdered girl, but rather her nine-year-old brother. (JonBenet had a nine-year-old brother at the time of her death.) The book is Skyler's memoir, told a decade after the crime, as he combats drug addiction and bad memories while living alone in a dingy New Jersey flat. Among a host of afflictions, he suffers from Repetitive Compulsion Syndrome, which manifests itself as \"my helpless need to repeat, re-view, and re-vise certain episodes from my past/my sister's past ad nauseum\".</p> <p>The first half of the book comprises his account of the years leading up to his sister's demise. In an upper middle-class family, Skyler is at first the apple of his mother Betsey's socially ambitious eye. He is less pleasing to his macho father, Bix, especially after he settles upon gymnastics as his sport of choice. After a tumble leaves Skyler with a crippled leg, his sister, Edna Louise, displays a knack for figure skating. Her name is changed to Bliss, cosmetics are applied and coaches from the former Soviet Union are hired. Bliss becomes a mini-celebrity.</p> <p>And then the unthinkable happens: her battered body is found in a sexually suggestive pose in the family basement. Suspicion first falls on a local paedophile, who confesses and commits suicide. But Skyler hints that the real culprit may be closer to home. \"One day, Skyler has to reveal all he knows of his sister Bliss's life/death. It is Skyler Rampike's responsibility.\"</p> <p>Before that revelation comes, Oates provides a lavish, cynical portrait of family dysfunction in the money-and-celebrity-crazed 1990s. Bix and Betsey are simply monstrous. Her social ambition is so acute that she writes pyramidal lists targeting her affluent suburb's most desirable \"old\" families for strategic friendship. After being rebuffed, she goes after them using her famous daughter, who she pushes to the point of physical and emotional collapse with training and performance-enhancing drugs. Betsey embodies one of the truths of contemporary American public life: fame trumps money, every time. Bix, who works, appropriately enough, in the pharmaceuticals industry, is little more than a rutting pig who hardly seems to notice he has children, especially when there's a tart in sight. Though the couple provide eerie fascination when we first meet them, they soon wear out their welcome; Oates is guilty of overkill.</p> <p>This leaves the children. While Bliss is a cipher - how could she be anything else? - the depiction of Skyler gives the book its considerable power. His voice is a memorable portrait of contemporary American jetsam - sly, wounded, unruly, but oddly credible. Shuffled among exclusive \"prep schools\" that are little more than dressed-up psychiatric hospitals, Skyler somehow manages to survive. He even undertakes a love affair with a fellow refugee from a celebrity crime family, a liaison Oates, brilliantly, has Skyler write in the form of a teen romance novel. While Skyler's eventual naming of the guilty party provides narrative satisfaction, the novel's real achievement is the narrator's ability to salvage a remnant of his self from the wreckage that the American family can become.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Amidon's Human Capital is published by Penguin.

  "<h2>Burn After Reading (15)</h2> <p> (Ethan &amp; Joel Coen, 2008, US) Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich. 96 mins.</p> <p>No Country For Old Men was the moment Hollywood finally took the Coens seriously, and judging by this, they've been working hard to rectify that perception. This is everything No Country wasn't: light, high-spirited, amusing, irreverent. It's like a medley of Coens screwball tropes: familiar characters doing familiar things (including dying unexpectedly) as they're sucked into a messy CIA/fitness trainer blackmail plot. Of course, it's still smart and funny (especially Brad Pitt), but rather inconsequential.</p> <h2>Igor (PG)</h2> <p> (Anthony Leondis, 2008, US) John Cusack, John Cleese, Eddie Izzard. 87 mins.</p> <p>Taking a limb from Tim Burton's body of work, and whatever else it can grab, this Frankenstein's monster of an animation follows a lowly evil scientist's assistant who goes solo, and creates a rather un-scary monster of his own. </p> <h2>Eagle Eye (12A)</h2> <p>(DJ Caruso, 2008, US/Ger) Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan. 118 mins.</p> <p>LaBeouf cements his action-hero status with a wildly preposterous \"wrong man\" thriller.

  "<p>Tarzan and His Mate, filmed in 1934, is exhibition-quality Art Moderne. It was shot day to day by uncredited co-directors, but its nominated director was the MGM production designer Cedric Gibbons, and it is visibly his creation, as were those showpieces of the era's high shine, The Thin Man, A Night at the Opera and The Philadelphia Story. The dreamiest of Gibbons's worlds, though, was the jungle put together from Californian locations at Thousand Oaks, the San Fernando Valley, and Lot Two at Culver City Studios, and stocked with an Eden of African animals (the elephants were Indian with strap-on flappy ears, but nobody's perfect). </p> <p>Tarzan and His Mate is like an inlay of rare woods and chrome aboard a deluxe liner of the period, with its rhinos, lions, zebras and three prime primates prancing across the frieze. OK, Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane is Miss Grimacing Prim until she puts on a backless evening gown that looks to be of molten platinum, then loses it and bathes nude, whereupon she's delicious, notwithstanding that her underwater body was doubled by a pro swimmer. </p> <p>As for the two alpha males, they are eroticism carnally incarnate. Johnny Weissmuller, Olympic aqua champion, is Tarzan, of beautiful physique and presence, his face magical and tragic as long as he maintains silence or restricts vocals to his unique yell. And then there's Cheeta the chimpanzee. When Cheeta, tending the wounded ape-man, brushes Tarzan's brow with leaves, you feel you shouldn't be watching such an intimate gesture. </p> <p>There has long been a movie rumour, which goes unmentioned in this sensational-in-the-best-sense autobiography, that the chimp in Tarzan and His Mate isn't the 76-year-old Cheeta now in retirement in Palm Springs, the oldest living non-human primate in the world and the personality behind this curse and tell book. The whisper is that Weissmuller clasped to his bare bosom AN Other chimp, and that the celebrious Cheeta, aka Jiggs, who went on to star in 12 Tarzan movies, was barely past babyhood in 1934, not long off the boat from Liberia. All he did in the pic was a cameo as a cute kid. Before I read the autobiography, I might have credited the anon ape, fate unknown, but Cheeta's version is so much more believable. In his entranced recall, he was orphaned by the ordinary savagery of the real jungle, then saved by Henry Trefflich, supplier of monkeys to showbiz and medical labs; before the freighter docked on a New York pier Cheets/Jiggs had already dodged death by a perfectly timed skid on a banana-skin that knocked a black mamba off its murderous intent. </p> <p>Cheeta first encountered cinema when on the run (more on the climb) in Manhattan, and what else should he see but King Kong? He immediately understood the Jungian truth of movies: that they are collective dreams \"dreamed on to the wall\" by their watchers. By the time he made it to Hollywood, evading lethal selection for the lab, and blows as he learned discipline, he was even more attuned to the art form: the actors enacted the dream \"and as a kind of byproduct of converting the dream into the past, the cameras gave us our souls - they poured soul over us and if they gave you enough of it, you started to become an Immortal ... once the dream was in the past ... moviegoers would rush in their millions to live in it rather than in the present.\" Cine-poetry. James Agee would be jealous.</p> <p>Of course, Cheeta's career wasn't all the philosophy of an art and multiple takes with Johnny through the length of a blissful afternoon. As Cheeta cheerfully volunteers, even during the golden years he spent 65% of his time masturbating in a cage, and, encouraged by breeders and Charlie Chaplin's entourage, fruitfully inseminating female apes. Off-set he met Johnny only a few times a year, when they and the usual suspects - David Niven, Douglas Fairbanks - got up to monkey business: practical jokes that ended in pranged automobiles; liquor, smokes and coke; weekly sex parties. (No he didn't. Especially not, as rumoured, with Dolores Del R\u00edo.) </p> <p>Johnny also introduced his sequential wives to his true mate. Cheeta foresaw that number three, Mexican spitfire Lupe V\u00e9lez, would self-destruct; but just as he had done with the shrill O'Sullivan in Tarzan's New York Adventure, 1942, he had to exert himself to oust wife number four from the picture. Cheeta liked wife number five, but by then Johnny and Cheets were on the skids, with the Tarzan franchise sold to RKO and zombified dialogue displacing the powerful old vocabulary of umgawa and ahhheeyeeyeeyaahhheeyeeyeeyaaaah! </p> <p>Cheeta's memory gets unreliable around Tarzan and the Mermaids, shot or not in Acapulco in 1948 - maybe it was the tequila-based coco locos he drank, or depression after being fired for temperament, or a valid artistic reaction to the degradation of RKO production values. He bypasses his appearance opposite Johnny's successor, that unclasped jackknife Lex Barker. </p> <p>Cheeta registers everything else, though: the bummest of poverty row movies, Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla, 1952, the comeback that flopped in Doctor Dolittle, 1967, his decades on the back roads playing live dates until the mood of America changed and a tumble of touring chimps seemed less like a cheapo Marx Brothers act and more like exploitation. He aged better than many of his old acquaintance - Cheets never guested in a bad toupee as a suspect in a late episode of Colombo - and when he finally drifted into becalmed safety at the Creative Habitats and Enrichment for Endangered and Threatened Apes in Palm Springs, he had a past to express through a newfound talent for fingerpainting. </p> <p>His subject is always Johnny. Not the bankrupt bodily wreck who fetched up in Mexico with a sixth wife and had a recording of the yell played thrice as his coffin was lowered into the ground; not the silver ghost that haunts the Turner Classic Movies channel; but the possibilities for immortality inherent in the collective dream - \"It's hard to die when Mr Tarzan's around,\" to quote Barry Fitzgerald in Tarzan's Secret Treasure, 1941. </p> <p>This book is great gossip - did Esther Williams feature in the section the lawyers pulled?; ace film criticism (yep, Robert De Niro sure does look like he's been on mouldy straw in the cage too long); and tremendous polemic - how well Cheets argues that an animated Pixar pixel hasn't suffered for its art, hasn't eluded death, there's no soul there even if every hair is exactly replicated. And it's the definitive buddy movie. These guys loved each other. As the trailer titles for Tarzan and His Mate say, \"elemental passions ... never will it be surpassed\". </p> <p>Cheets, just one thing - your ghostwriter. You couldn't have tipped him/her a miniscule credit on the copyright page, down where they acknowledge that the paper sources were approved by the Forestry Stewardship Council? I suppose not, even though he/she is an inspired writer. Genius, even. But it's Hollywood. Print the legend. Aahhheeyeeyeeyaahhheeyeeyeeyaaaah!</p>",
  "<p>It is hardly surprising that Ruby Lennox, the narrator of Kate Atkinson's Behind the Scenes at the Museum, should, aged 17, fantasise about her own funeral - the open coffin strewn with flowers, a church filled not just with friends and family but also \"an admiring Leonard Cohen and a soulful Terence Stamp\", and with Maria Callas singing. (It is 1968.) For the novel, which is her story of her family, has more deaths than even Dickens would have dared include. \"As a family, we are genetically disposed towards having accidents.\"</p> <p>Ruby is an all-seeing narrator. In numbered and dated chapters, she narrates her life, in the present tense. In alternating sections - \"Footnotes\" - she recovers episodes from the lives of her forebears. The high mortality rate in these parts of the novel is perhaps historically unsurprising: golden-haired Ada, who would have become Ruby's great-aunt, dies of diphtheria at 12, like many a Victorian child; in the Edwardian age, grandmother Nell's sweetheart Percy is proposing to her in one paragraph, and dead from a ruptured appendix in the next.</p> <p>History is a blackly comic trickster. Frank, the narrator's grandfather, who survived the first world war, perishes when a German plane, having overshot the York railway yards, dumps its bombs on him as he takes a shortcut down an alley. \"Bad luck because it hadn't been aiming at Frank at all, of course.\" </p> <p>The narrative insouciance makes calamities tragi-comic. For while the characters may be mystified by events, the narrator always knows how things happen. (She cannot fail to tell us that the German plane was shot down soon after and its crew were buried in the same cemetery as unlucky Frank.) When Jack, fianc\u00e9 of the narrator's grandmother Nell, gets a safe posting during the Battle of the Somme, training dogs for special missions, you know that fate will deal some ironical card. Sure enough, having become sentimentally attached to one particular dog, he is killed when he leaves his trench to try to rescue it after it is wounded.</p> <p>Some deaths are comically histrionic. Ruby's father, an incorrigible but inept womaniser, dies the death he might have wished, a coital coronary as he couples on the floor with one of the buffet waitresses at a family wedding. Ruby catches his last moments, and his last words on earth: \"Oh bloody bloody Nora!\" It is summer 1966 and, as she and the waitress realise that he is \"not in a stupor of satisfaction\", Kenneth Wolstenholme's voice echoes from the hotel television. </p> <p>Deaths are constantly foretold. We are told of Ada's sad demise several chapters before it happens. When we hear about Nell's elder brother Lawrence running away to sea, the narrator cannot resist telling us that, after two decades of travel and adventure, he will be blown up by a German mine in the North Sea \"just as the English coast was sighted\". In the very first chapter Ruby is telling us how her sister Gillian, born after the second world war, represents to their parents \"the promise of the future\" when she interrupts herself with a parenthesis: \"(Not much of a future as it turned out, as she gets run over by a pale blue Hillman Husky in 1959 but how are any of us to know this?)\" </p> <p>One hundred and fifty pages later, this death foretold actually takes place, on Christmas Eve, in a chapter beginning \"Gillian's last day\". Gillian is run over leaving the Christmas pantomime, at which she has taken to the stage as a singing volunteer from the audience. \"Really, she is a one, our Gillian,\" comments one of the family party. \"Not for much longer,\" adds the narrator, with the funny-cruel benefit of hindsight.</p> <p>As Ruby recalls her sister's death, she remembers and adopts the blackly unsentimental manner of her childhood self. She and her other sister, Patricia, look at the Christmas tree and wonder silently how Gillian's presents might be reapportioned. Ruby's coolness in her manner of narrating the novel's deaths is one reason why the novel is funny rather than mournful. But this coolness also has an explanation. A family saga will always have revelations, and near the end of Atkinson's novel we find that not every death has left her protagonist unshaken. There is a secret to be revealed that is not comic at all.</p> <p>\u2022 John Mullan is professor of English at University College London.

  "<p>With avenues to victory in the presidential race closing fast, Republicans are now laying the groundwork for casting doubt on the results. Prepare yourself for lurid tales, these next two-and-a-half weeks, of \"voter fraud\".</p> <p>Here's the situation. Turnout in America is lower than in other countries - we consider 55%-60% to be an achievement. The 40%-45% of Americans who do not vote, studies show, tend to be from lower-income and more African-American and Latino households than the general population. In other words, more Democratic.</p> <p>Hence, Democrats are forever trying to expand the electorate. In the past two years, they have registered huge numbers of voters in some important states. In Florida this year for example, Democrats have added about 450,000 voters, Republicans just 170,000.</p> <p>Republicans have always tried to suppress turnout, sometimes by fair means but often by foul. Every election season in black communities across the US, mysterious handbills appear warning citizens - untruthfully - that if they owe back taxes or even parking tickets, they can't vote. Voting machines have tended to \"malfunction\" on election day at a higher rate in black areas than in white. None of this, of course, is ever traceable.</p> <p>This is what we historically call voter suppression. Republicans, ever alert to opportunities to spoon-feed the media storylines proving that \"both sides\" are guilty of excess, have countered with narratives about voter fraud. But how real is voter fraud? It exists here and there, no doubt. But a study by a Columbia University found that between 2002 and 2005, the US justice department won just 24 successful voter-fraud convictions - in the entire country - during the same period that the department made such prosecutions a high priority. </p> <p>If this is a crime wave, we could do with many more like it.</p> <p>This year, with an African-American Democratic nominee and black turnout expected to hit record levels, the effort has gone into overdrive. One nationwide community organising group, Acorn, stands accused of all manner of fraudulent voter registration. The group acknowledges that some of its organisers did pad out their numbers. But it says it fired them. </p> <p>A few days ago the FBI leaked that it was investigating Acorn - interesting timing, no? A former federal prosecutor in New Mexico, a conservative Republican who was controversially fired by the Bush administration in large part because he did not see voter fraud as a major criminal enterprise, says the investigation smells to high heaven. \"I'm astounded that this issue is being trotted out again,\" he told the website Talking Points Memo on Thursday. \"Based on what I saw in 2004 and 2006, it's a scare tactic.\"</p> <p>It's that, all right, but it's more. Republicans are bracing themselves for a John McCain loss. They probably don't believe that \"exposing\" large-scale fraud can salvage the election for them. But they may well be thinking along other lines.</p> <p>Suppose Barack Obama wins, but a narrower victory than expected. Say he gets 284 electoral votes, and that 20 of those 284 come from Ohio. Since 270 are needed to win, Ohio will be the difference between victory and defeat. And suppose the Ohio vote is outside the margin that automatically triggers a recount, as was the case in Florida in 2000, but is still moderately close - 3% or so.</p> <p>You can bet in such a case that the Republicans will challenge the result. They will find a few cases of people voting from the wrong address. Their propagandists on the Fox News channel will follow. They likely won't prevail, but the effort will have the crucial effect of casting doubt on Obama's legitimacy and impinging on his mandate.</p> <p>The Obama people know all this, which is why they're working for a margin that would make such challenges moot. In the meantime, as you hear and read the sensational stories, remember the 24-person crime wave.</p>",
  "<p>In their hundreds they stand in line, waiting to pay tribute to their hero. Girls with iPods, skinheads in leather jackets, elderly women with shopping trollies and tanned athletic types in Prada sunglasses shuffle silently forward.</p> <p>\"We wanted the kids to feel the enormity of the occasion. After all, he is our Lady Di and this is our 9/11,\" says Anton Krem, 45, who is here to pay his last respects to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/jorg-haider\">J\u00f6rg Haider</a>, the Austrian rightwing populist politician who died in a drunken, high-speed car crash a week ago and whose coffin sits on a pedestal in the Landhaus, seat of Carinthia's regional parliament, the southern province where he was governor. </p> <p>An after-work crowd of about 300 makes its way through an avenue of huge wreaths. Everyone from the Chamber of Carinthian Chemists to the regional tourist board has sent a display. Klagenfurt, the state capital, is busy preparing itself for today's ceremony, the most emotional state funeral since that of the last Austrian empress, Zita von Bourbon-Parma, in 1989.</p> <p>Amid a sea of red candles one teenager has written: \"To a great man of the nation who fought for his land. Our hero, our fighter, our sunshine.\" Another note reads: \"Our king of hearts\". Slipped in between are pictures of Haider, an orange sweater - the colour of his breakaway Alliance for the Future of Austria party (BZO) - draped over his shoulders, glass of beer in hand; another shows the maverick fascist bungee jumping off a bridge.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, functionaries and volunteers have been working around the clock sending invitations. Austria's political elite are expected to attend tomorrow. But the 50,000 mourners are also expected to include Belgian nationalist Filip Dewinter, French extremist Jean-Marie le Pen, Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of the Italian wartime fascist leader, Umberto Bossi from Italy's Northern League, Swiss industrialist Christoph Blocher, and a handful of Waffen-SS veterans, whom Haider once described as \"men of character\". Younger far-right figures have also hinted they will turn up, though Austrian intelligence is on alert to turn away groups of skinheads or neo-fascists, to stop the event turning into a rally.</p> <p>With state broadcaster ORF planning live coverage, President Heinz Fischer, who will give the main speech, and other politicians have asked for assurances that they will not appear in the same frames as anyone from the far right. \"They realise it could get very embarrassing,\" says Hans Rauscher, veteran writer for Der Standard newspaper.</p> <p>The fear gripping the elite shows the extent to which Haider managed to impose himself on Austria's political scene, becoming a figurehead for an array of far-right European groups. Particularly at such a sensitive economic moment, when parallels with 1929 and the great depression are drawn every day, the fear is that the extreme right may seek to exploit the symbolic power of such a gathering.</p> <p>\"The possibilities for a rise of the far right in the light of the financial and economic crisis are there,\" warns Anton Pelinka, professor of politics at the Central European University in Budapest and author of The Haider Phenomenon.</p> <p>In fact the extreme right is already in the ascendant in several European countries. In Italy the Northern League is enjoying its place in Silvio Berlusconi's ruling coalition. Blocher's Swiss People's party is the biggest political force in the country, Belgium's Vlaams Belang maintains its strength in Flanders, while in Denmark Pia Kj\u00e6rsgaard's anti-immigrant Danish People's party is the third largest in the parliament. Racism has risen in Europe in recent years, with polls showing widespread antisemitism and anti-Muslim sentiment. </p> <p>But the far right does not seem to be finding it any easier to work together. \"In the European parliament there's a strong incentive to do this - if you establish a party group you get funds and more opportunities,\" Pelinka says. \"But the far-right parties have contradicting nationalistic narratives and this makes it very difficult to form one group.\" </p> <p>\"Denmark and the Netherlands suffered under the Nazis so their far-right groups would never consider joining forces with far-right groups from Austria and Germany,\" says Richard Brem, editor in chief of a Vienna-based online youth culture magazine. The same goes for the far-right movements of Poland and the Czech Republic. Like Bossi and Blocher, the Netherlands' late Pim Fortuyn might well have seen the well-dressed, perma-tanned Haider as a visual model for his own brand of populist politics, but in fact they had little in common beyond their anti-immigrant rhetoric. Fortuyn, who was openly gay, saw himself as a libertarian whose rights were being curtailed by the immigrant Muslim population. Haider's ethos grew out of an old-time fascism, his country's Nazi past and a psychological need to defend the Nazi generation - including his parents - who he thought were unjustly treated after the war.</p> <p>\"Official Austrian state doctrine after the war was that the Allies liberated Austria from Nazi Germany in 1945 and that Austria had been a victim of the Nazis in 1938,\" says Pelinka. \"This overlooks the fact that the percentage of Austrians who participated in the Nazi regime was the same as in Germany. In contrast, Germany was forced to confront its past directly and did so. Austria was not and didn't.\"</p> <p>In Germany, Haider - famous for his outbursts lauding SS veterans, his description of Austria as an \"ideological miscarriage\", his labelling of Nazi death camps as \"punishment camps\" and admiration for the Third Reich's \"sensible employment policies\" - could never have achieved the same success. </p> <p>Haider himself was frustrated in his attempts to form a pan-European far-right club, though he was successful at least in his intention of provoking European leaders after they slapped sanctions on Austria following the electoral success of his Freedom party (FPO) in 2000.</p> <p>Nonetheless he is credited with having injected new life into far-right politics. \"He was one of the first in Europe to grasp that it's not about issues or a rational discourse, but about emotion,\" says Brem. \"He understood that politics was about marketing and you need to be marketing savvy to succeed.\"</p> <p>\"What Haider did was to bring Austria's SS and Nazi history out of the past and put it in the present and because he was such a charismatic politician he got away with it,\" says Rauscher. \"But his lasting legacy is the way that he poisoned the political atmosphere in Austria in the process.\" </p> <p>Throughout Carinthia there is hardly a person who says Haider has not shaken their hand, or bought them a schnapps. Others talk of receiving \u20ac100 handouts from him, a campaign which earned him the nickname \"Robin Hood\", or speak of the time he lowered petrol prices and introduced free kindergartens.</p> <p>In the Pumpe pub on Benediktiner Platz in Klagenfurt, drinkers sit around whispering about how Haider died. The figure \"142\" is repeated often. That is the speed (in kilometres an hour) at which he was driving when he crashed his VW Phaeton on Saturday night. The news has by now filtered down that he was drunk at the wheel.</p> <p>\"Some say he was criminal because he was drunk, but that's an insult,\" says Christa, a 17-year-old who was among the country's new young voters (the voting age is 16), who gave her support to Haider's BZO in elections two weeks ago. \"He did so much for everyone.\" </p> <p>Does she think he belittled national socialism? \"Well, I don't really know what that is,\" she replies. \"If you mean, was he right to lock up foreigners, yes, because people with a criminal tendency have no place here.\"</p> <p>The \"Lady Di\" comparison is repeated often, along with references to James Dean, Austrian rock star Falco and even the Dalai Lama (\"for his ability to reach out to everyone\", says one man). Many voice their suspicion that Haider was in fact murdered by Mossad, despite the scientific tests that show he was several times over the alcohol limit.</p> <p>The television newsreader who announced his death ended her report with the message: \"Dear Carinthians, I wish you as much strength as you need to get through this,\" while Haider's right-hand man Stefan Petzner, the new leader of the BZO, said the \"sun has fallen from the sky\".</p> <p>\"It's not, it's still there,\" says Carinthian writer Egyd Gst\u00e4ttner, who observed Haider for two decades. He talks in disgust of a \"f\u00fchrer cult\" surrounding Haider. On Monday morning, like every Carinthian schoolchild, his 10-year-old daughter was told by her religious affairs teacher to fill up a page of her exercise book with a black cross and Haider's name.</p> <p>One of Haider's last acts was the establishment of what he called a sonderlager - a special camp for old, sick, and criminal asylum seekers, set on an isolated, 1,200-metre-high alpine pasture. He told his voters he planned to \"concentrate\" Chechens there, enabling the \"final goal\" of their extradition to be carried out more smoothly. In other countries politicians would be forced to resign over such issues. According to Florian Klenk, deputy editor of news magazine Falter, \"In Austria the typical reaction was, \"Well, that's just Haider. And actually he's right.\"</p> <p>Last month he won 10% of the vote in national elections, following his victory in Carinthian elections last March. </p> <p>Commentators suggest it is too early to predict the effect Haider's death may have on far-right politics in Austria. Heinz-Christian Strache, his former ally and more hardline successor as leader of the FPO, has not ruled out a merger with Haider's BZO. That would give the combined far-right parties the same strength they had when Austria was ostracised for that very reason eight years ago.</p> <p>Today's gathering might well set alarm bells ringing that Europe's extreme right is gathering steam at a time of economic turmoil. \"Strache, Bossi and Le Pen will do everything to exploit the crisis,\" says Pelinka. \"And they will have some success. But at the moment there is no indication that they can and will be able to get the amount of power Mussolini, Hitler and co enjoyed in the interwar period.\" </p> <p>But the real test, Pelinka says, will come if the economic situation worsens and unemployment rises. He will be watching to see the extent to which countries such as Germany - whose high unemployment in the 1930s led to the rise of Hitler - have really changed. \"The question is whether we can assume that in the decades since 1945 countries like Austria, Germany and Italy have been able to create a different, more stable democratic political culture.\"</p>",
  "<p>Carlos Fuentes's new short story collection takes its title and epigraph, tongue in cheek, from Tolstoy's famous (and questionable) aphorism: \"All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" Questionable because the reverse is also true, as Fuentes's remarkable book goes on to show. Happiness and unhappiness carry innumerable meanings within those arbitrary constructs that are supposed to bind together groups of mostly dissimilar human beings, stifling them under hypocritical conceits such as adultery, filial piety, parental discipline and ancestor worship. Taboos and superstitious wisdoms mark these groupings, and around them we have built our societies and our literature. Families breed violence. As Fuentes makes clear, families are the backbone of all our stories.</p> <p>Fuentes enjoys turning things inside out, finding out how things work from within, and how their appearances delude us. Since his very first books, his subject has been the invention of history, society's attempt to chronicle the simultaneity of events in time (in his native Mexico, in the uncomfortably contiguous United States or in the uncomfortably distant Europe); and his preferred method has been to examine the clockwork rather than the clock. Consequently, it isn't the individual characters that interest him in this collection but the social mechanism that makes them tick, the \"family\" that assigns to each a seemingly inherited and guilty role.</p> <p>The \"happy families\" of the book are Mexican, and a kind of madness governs them all (as it does perhaps every family), establishing unlikely alliances and enmities, and forcing each member into absurdly violent situations that reflect, or are reflected in, the absurd Shakespearean violence of Mexico itself. Here, in Edith Grossman's immensely readable translation, are local versions of Cordelia condemned for not being sufficiently vocal and various Hamlets unable or unwilling to obey the wishes of their fathers' ghosts. Mexican Montagues and Capulets carry on family quarrels under the guise of gang wars, while power-hungry Prosperos keep their Mirandas locked in an enforced virginity. With grim humour and sharp intelligence, Fuentes has drawn 16 vignettes of Mexican family history that together form a literary kaleidoscope of human relationships. A rebellious daughter secludes herself in cyberland, thereby escaping from the absurdity of her family into the absurdity of the virtual world. Four prodigal sons are told by their father that they must become priests and find that they're not prodigal enough to obey. A couple define themselves by playing out sadistic games according to what male and female are expected to be. A mother attempts to bring her daughter back to life by speaking of her to the man who killed her. A gay couple attempt to recall their affections through a film vocabulary in which the word gay carried a very different connotation. All fail, perhaps because it is in the nature of families that individual accomplishment is impossible unless the individual breaks away. And that can hardly ever be accomplished without the shedding of blood.</p> <p>Perhaps the story that best illuminates the book's theme is the last one, \"Eternal Father\", a contemporary Mexican version of King Lear. A dying patriarch, who has held his three daughters under his power all their lives, stipulates in his will that, if they wish to inherit, they must gather around his grave on the 10th anniversary of his death. The father's violent presence has rendered them meek and mute, and now, long after his death, as the three sisters struggle to free themselves from his burden, they realise that they can only achieve this freedom by bringing his frightful shadow back into their consciousness: they must conjure him up again before they can be rid of him at last. But the attempt will fail. The three sisters find it impossible to recall the old man's face, even to guess at what age he died, or remember him except as a young man, as the \"young Papa\" of photographs. \"What's the difference between what used to be and what was?\" asks one them. \"The difference between conscience and memory,\" answers another. \"Later, Augusta wondered if there was a difference between conscience and memory. She thought there was. Memory happens today. We remember today. Conscience is always repentance buried in the past. We prefer to forget.\" In the end, only one of the sisters will become their father's heir: the only one who realises that all escape is futile and that, from the immutable past, the father still holds them in his grip.</p> <p>Kipling bookended his stories with apocryphal poems; Fuentes, in a more classical mode, gives each story a coda in the form of a chorus who, in a woeful, mocking or ironic tone, comments on the story's theme. The last coda, however, appended to \"Eternal Father,\" is called \"Choruscodaconrad\". It is merely four words long, but serves, dramatically and precisely, to conclude and gloss the entire book. It reads \"the violence, the violence\" and there is no full stop after the final word.</p> <p>\u2022 Alberto Manguel's The Library at Night is published by Yale.

  "<p>After making your own soup and snacks, you'll need good storage solutions if your children want to take the homemade goods to school. To keep things cool and edible, a useful lunchbox should fasten well, be easy to clean and durable. Try to find ones that don't take up too much space and contain a good insulator. Everything else is down to personal choice: do you want frilly patterns? A section for ice packs (very useful in the summer)? A box covered with the face of a popular cartoon character?</p> <p>Look to Swiss company <strong>Sigg</strong> for the best quality. The <strong>Aluminium clip-shut lunch box </strong> in the medium size (\u00a317.99, <a href=\"http://kiddieskitchen.co.uk/store/default.asp\">kiddieskitchen.co.uk</a>) is hardy and the rubber seal inside makes it leak-proof.

The final option is the <strong>Polar Gear Fold Up Lunch Cooler</strong> (\u00a33.99, see <a href=\"http://www.polargear.co.uk/\">polargear.co.uk</a> for stockists), which is insulated and comes in pink, turquoise and dark blue. This is cheaply priced (great for the credit crunch) and best of all it folds down flat once you've eaten all the contents. </p> <p>When purchasing a flask, the most important things to check are: how long does it keep the liquid hot for? Is the outer casing durable? And how many litres does it hold?</p> <p>If you want something that will keep soup warm, then you're obviously after a vacuum flask: the flasks by Thermos are fantastic and come with a five- to ten-year guarantee. A great buy is the <strong>Thermos Multi Purpose stainless steel flask O.8L</strong> (\u00a313, <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/\">johnlewis.com</a>) which keeps food hot for eight hours.

  "<p>I've always taken it for granted that the kitchen was the hub of family life. When I was a child, that's where my mother was when I got home from school. Busy at the scrubbed wooden table, she would hand me the pastry cutters or a saucepan of vegetables simmered in fragrant, herby stock, to rub through a sieve with a wooden spoon, to make soup. </p> <p>I chattered about my day, unwinding. After homework, I laid the table, then drained and mashed the potatoes while Mum dished up. When my father came home we sat down to eat. And as we ate, we talked.</p> <p>This was possible because my mother didn't go out to work. Later, I too was a stay-at-home mum, going from mature student to self-employed, working from home. So I had time at my disposal. Nevertheless, I failed to follow my mother's example. Seduced by the new phenomenon of convenience food, I fed my children, Sophy and Hugh, almost exclusively on fish fingers, Findus crispy pancakes, Smash and Bird's Angel Delight. It was only at Sunday lunch that tradition was maintained: roast meat, roast potatoes, a green veg and thick brown gravy, followed by a pie, tart or crumble made with whatever fruit was in season.</p> <p>I had the leisure but not the will. Today our children and their friends have the will but not the leisure - with both partners working, family meals are difficult to achieve, especially in term time. After school there's football or orchestra practice or ballet, and the time-slot left for tea-homework-bath-bed is miniscule. Cooking and eating together can usually take place only at weekends, but most families seem to put a higher value on leisurely, shared family meals than my generation, who took it for granted, ever did.</p> <p>There is certainly a fulfilling role for granny as cook. My mother used to tell her grandchildren The Story of Lambkin, with the oft-repeated refrain: 'To Granny's house I go / That I may fatter grow', and it runs through my head when a visit from the family is due, and Rob, my husband, and I settle down happily in the kitchen to prepare for it. He harvests his home-grown veg, and makes delicious, fruity ice-cream with strawberries, raspberries, blackcurrants and damsons from the garden. Together we prepare soups and stews, and get the boring bits, like peeling spuds, over before the family arrive. Once they are here there is the pleasure of feeding them, but also the delicate territory of table manners and food preferences. Sometimes I find myself biting back the words: \"When I was your age I ate what was put in front of me.\" The urge to show love for your family by feeding them is a basic instinct, and it's thwarting, when you offer up undying love on a plate, to have it rejected. </p> <p>I want to indulge my instinct and I want to encourage the children to be adventurous about food, but boy, do they sometimes make it difficult. One of my grandsons, Oscar, to his credit, eats anything, including, last weekend, a caterpillar embedded in curly kale (it tasted bitter - the caterpillar, not the kale); but Max won't eat anything pink; Guy loves broccoli, hates beans; Chloe loves porridge, loathes muesli and Freddie likes apples but not pears (as in the word game 'loves rabbits, hates hares', maddening to anyone not in the know).</p> <p>With my own children I dutifully went through the frustrating business of coaxing them to eat, spoonful by spoonful. Unable to meet the challenging stare of a wilful child hurling a mangled banana to the floor for the umpteenth time, I usually succumbed to emotional blackmail and polished off what was left on the plate or gave it to Rex, who always stationed himself strategically under the high chair, tail wagging.</p> <p>Today's parents don't have time for such games. Instead, many offer their children a choice at every meal and grannies tend to disapprove. But I'm converted. Our grandchildren have, let's hope, a lifetime to discover new flavours and textures, and to change their minds about old, familiar ones. So who cares if, at the age of three, instead of five-a-day, they're having broccoli, broccoli, broccoli, broccoli and broccoli? I was past 30 when I started to like spinach, and I'm still prepared to give mashed swede a chance, once every five years. The important thing is to introduce children to the idea that preparing, cooking and sharing food is fun. We have to eat every day, so we might as well enjoy it. One of the good things about reaching granny status, is having enough time to cook properly for the family. </p> <p>But the best part is cooking with them as well as for them. \"Granny can we make something?\" is the cry as they tumble out of the car. Something means chocolate fudge cake, meringues or anything that involves squidging and rolling out pastry. The diet police probably have a warrant out for my arrest, but I'll plead in mitigation that they also help Grandpa dig the potatoes and pick and pod the peas.</p> <p>\u2022 The Good Granny Companion is published by Short Books</p>",
  "<p>For the theme of the cake, Mel Hudson and Vicki Pepperdine wanted something \"attractive and original, that children will relate to\", but also \"practical and of relevance to today's hard-pressed working family on a budget\". They have chosen Picasso's Weeping Woman (1937, oil on canvas, Tate Collection). </p> <p><strong>8.30am </strong>Vicki arrives at Mel's house ready to start work. Both women are determined that their children should have fun and derive valuable educational experience from the culinary process, but during this crucial planning phase, it's thought best to keep them in the sitting room researching basic techniques via CBeebies' Big Cook Little Cook. </p> <p><strong>8.45am </strong>The duo set about devising the best method of constructing the piece. Vicki has made what she terms a sponge base the night before, and has come armed with some indispensable advice manuals on the subject by children's healthy cookery guru Annabel Karmel - including The Complete Children's Mealtimes, More Complete Children's Mealtimes, The Complete and Utter Nightmare of Children's Mealtimes, and The New Complete Children's Mealtimes (featuring recipes left out from the previous volumes, now reprinted as The Incomplete Children's Mealtimes and available at a reduced price). However it soon becomes clear that none of these actually contain a recipe for Picasso's Weeping Woman cake, so the pair are thrown back on their own imaginations.</p> <p><strong>9.45am </strong>The children are consulted to see whether Big Cook Little Cook has thrown up anything useful, but it seems not. Batman, In the Night Garden and The Jeremy Kyle Show have also drawn a blank, although Tracy Beaker raises hopes momentarily.</p> <p><strong>10.30am </strong>Following a (rare - both women have recently given up caffeine) double espresso, Mel draws up a detailed list of ingredients while Vicki sketches a template of Picasso's masterpiece, from memory, on a piece of greaseproof paper. Do they feel the Weeping Woman may be too ambitious? Vicki: \"Food in the shape of faces is one of the standard tropes of kiddy-cheffery, but we were anxious to avoid obvious cliches - things like the quite literally \"cheesy easy pizza faces\" you find in some of the books on Mel's shelf.\" Mel: \"Yes, in any case some of those recipes look easy but they're not. The Cheesy Feet, for instance, where you get your kids to draw around their feet onto a piece of baking parchment - it just says 'transfer the foot to some puff pastry, sprinkle it with cheese and stick it in the oven' - I mean how misleading is that? My son couldn't play football for a month!\"</p> <p><strong>11am </strong>It's time to let the kids loose. However, this being the school holidays, their time is limited. Vicki realises that hers are now due at aikido, summer film school and violin camp, respectively. She leaves. Mel is keen her 12-year-old son should not feel excluded, but he is unwilling to be drawn away from a game of Super Mario Smash Bros Brawl in which he has been absorbed for 26 days, and so it is her daughter Chiara, who is set to work, sieving icing sugar into a bowl. </p> <p><strong>11.03am </strong>Some icing sugar is spilt on the work top and floor. Rather than let her daughter see her get stressed over \"mess\", Mel asks a neighbour's au pair to take her to the park for some fresh air. Chiara stays behind to clean up.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm </strong>Vicki returns, belatedly, her round trip having included emergency dashes to I Camisa in Soho (for black squid-ink tagliatelle for the Weeping Woman's hair) and The Ivy (for lunch). Mel has come back with melons, a mango and blueberries for the Woman's hat. The finished product will, the pair insist, form a \"complete meal\", comprising elements of all three main food groups and including the requisite five portions of fruit and veg per day, as well as many cancer-fighting ingredients. As mothers, any future diseases or negative life outcomes among their children will be their sole responsibility.</p> <p><strong>4pm </strong>A photographer arrives from the Guardian to document the work in progress. By now, desperate to fulfil the brief of cooking with children, Hudson and Pepperdine convince Mel's son to begin slicing mango into shapes for the hat pieces, using a sharp knife, while Vicki, Mel and Chiara set about delicately fashioning the Woman's eyelashes and fringe using liquorice bootlaces and grated cheese - although most of Chiara's bits have to be redone, and she leaves the kitchen after Mel shouts at her.</p> <p><strong>4.30pm </strong>Mel's partner arrives back early from work to take their son to A&amp;E for suturing to his thumb, which is thought necessary, although Mel has temporarily staunched the bleeding with an ice-pack shaped into a replica of the Arc de Triomphe (one of a number which she makes in batches and keeps in the freezer for emergencies.)</p> <p><strong>5.30pm</strong> The final challenge is to lay sheets of red and yellow royal icing over the biscuit base, forming blocks of colour that will frame the Woman's face (currently being scraped off the template, where it has stuck.) There are two ways of making royal icing : laboriously, by hand, with egg whites and sugar; or - the cheat's way - ready-to-roll icing which you simply roll out to the required size and drape carefully over the cake using a rolling pin. Mel and Vicki opt for the cheat's way. But this proves too difficult: each attempt to remove the sheet of icing from its surface results in it breaking. </p> <p><strong>8.30pm </strong>After some discussion, and the pre-emptive opening of a (planned, celebratory) bottle of pinot grigio, Mel goes to Sainsbury's for more royal icing, leaving Vicki painstakingly mixing food dyes to achieve the right colours. This process is then repeated. On the third trip to Sainsbury's, Mel finds the coloured icing - in red and yellow blocks, roughly the right size, which, strangely, seem to be part of a new range labelled Picasso. </p> <p><strong>1.30am </strong>The cake is finished. All agree it is a success. The photographer takes some final shots, and then gives Vicki (who has been consuming five portions a day of pinot grigio for some time) a lift home. </p> <p>\u2022 Hudson and Pepperdine are currently working on a reconstruction of Picasso's Guernica for a planned Guardian supplement on needlework</p>",
  "<p>At a time when retail therapy has become as unfashionable a treatment (but for what?) as syrup-of-figs, London's newest shopping mall is preparing to open its doors. The 40-acre Westfield mall in Shepherd's Bush - \"Westfield London\" as it wants us to know it - will be the biggest thing of its kind within the boundaries of a British city. Two new railway stations have been built to serve it and a third extensively refurbished. Westfield's 265 shops and 50 restaurants include Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, Gucci, Prada, the Croque Gascon and the Comptoir Libanais, as well Topshop and Marks &amp; Spencer. The floor is covered in marble: \"half the metamorphic layer of Italy is in here\", a Westfield executive said recently, meaning there was a lot. Westfield's cinema has 13 screens. Westfield's car park can take 4,500 cars. Westfield's bus station will cope with 65 buses an hour. One could go on. </p> <p>It opens on October 30. The timing is sublime to students of paradox. Just over the road at Television Centre, BBC editors are researching footage of other great slumps. The feelings of hubris and fright steadily thicken. The screens at some British airports still echo George Bush's instructions to his fellow Americans after 9/11, flashing \"Relax and shop\" opposite the details of flights that lack a gate number, but how annoying this seems now, how fiscally irresponsible, how stupid, how oxymoronic. Also, even at the best times, who needs more shops in London? Isn't there a place called the West End? Why would the Prada customer want to take the Central Line to Shepherd's Bush, or (though I don't recommend this) approach by a change of train at Willesden Junction? </p> <p>Westfield has refined several answers to these questions, but the crude one is: it has worked before. It has been working, in fact, ever since Frank Lowy (pictured right), a Jewish migrant from Hungary, opened a deli in an unpromising stretch - indeed, a field - of Sydney's western suburbs in 1952. He is now Australia's richest man. There have been some hiccups along the way: paying $127m for a 99-year lease on the retail floor of the Word Trade Centre, and mentions by the US Senate committee investigating offshore tax havens and Israeli inquiries into Ehud Olmert's fundraising have not been helpful (they amount to no more than inferences, which Lowy \"totally rejects\"). But his company, Westfield Holdings, is said to be the world's biggest developer of shopping centres, with 116 spread mainly across Australia and the US. Shepherd's Bush will be its eighth in Britain and not the last; Westfield Stratford City, bookending London in shopping malls east and west, will open before the Olympics. According to Lowy's calculations, Britain has only half of Australia's retail space per head and a third of America's. For many of us this would be good news, but Lowy sees it as an opportunity. It was this thinking that led Lowy to take over the Shepherd's Bush site from another developer in 2004 - treading, quite unconsciously and with remarkable coincidence, in the footsteps of another Jewish Hungarian migrant who shared Lowy's appetite for size. Apart from the name, White City, no evidence of his achievement exists - the new mall demolished the last of it - but without Imre Kiralfy (born Imre Konigsbaum, Budapest, 1845) there would have been no site to develop. </p> <p>On the Ordnance Survey of 1893 it looks like no man's land: empty space punctuated by a brick works and what could be a spoil heap. And then, according to a little memoir he published in 1909 in the Strand Magazine, Imre Kiralfy had a waking dream: \"One night I lay awake in bed and, as if by magic, I saw stretched out before me an imposing city of palaces, domes and towers, set in cool, green spaces and intersected by many bridged canals ... Hitherto I had dealt in the shivering hues of gold and silver. This city would be white.\" </p> <p>No need to believe him. Kiralfy lived by theatrical excess. A child prodigy from the age of four as a musical entertainer and \"gypsy dancer\" he became besotted with mammoth entertainments after a visit to the Paris Exhibition in 1867. Travelling to New York, he \"saw instantly that the great public want in America was spectacle\" and set about providing some. As no theatre was quite large enough, he built a stage on Staten Island. He adapted Jules Verne's new hit, Around the World in Eighty Days, in a production that included running waterfalls and live elephants. </p> <p>The climax to his American career came in 1893, when his vast pageant of American history played to the crowds attending the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The exhibition buildings by the shore of Lake Michigan became the first \"White City\" - and a likelier inspiration for what Kiralfy did to the brickfields of Shepherd's Bush than the dream described in his memoir. He had moved to London by this time - he had an English wife - and was running Earls Court, where a series of shows celebrated the glories of empire. When, in 1905, the governments of Britain and France decided their new entente cordiale needed public festivity, the man they turned to was Kiralfy. </p> <p>Under his direction, the architectural equivalent of wedding cake arose over 140 acres: pavilions, an Irish village, lakes, canals, scenic railways, toboggan slides. When Rome backed out of the Olympics on grounds of expense, Kiralfy added a stadium in time for the games. White City mounted several more great exhibitions before the first world war and went on mounting smaller ones after Kiralfy's death in 1919. Eventually it grew greyer and more abandoned. A dog track kept the stadium in business until 1984, but by then the BBC had bought and built over most of the site. Westfield acquired the land that once held exhibition halls one to nine: British Nutriments, French Textiles, British Liberal Arts, etc. Had it not been for Kiralfy and the awkwardness of his inheritance, it would surely have been swallowed up by housing long ago. </p> <p>Today the likes of British Nutriments have been replaced by what Westfield calls its four corner anchors - Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, House of Fraser and Next - with the hundreds of shops between sheltering under a large glazed roof. There are certainly worse shopping malls, ecologically. Westfield prides itself on its water-harvesting, public transport access, and a carbon-saving air heating and cooling system. As for the slump, Westfield is sanguine; sure, not the best time to launch, but show us a recession that hasn't eventually turned into a boom. \"Unless,\" said a cheerful Westfield spokesman, \"you're talking about the final crisis of capitalism and I don't think we're planning on that.\" </p> <p>By this philosophy there are no limits to growth outside the constraints of capital and labour: people will need more and more Prada handbags, increasing supplies of chicken tikka wraps. Westfield's success depends either on that or on its ability to destroy the trade of other shops. I don't know why - it was probably looking at pictures of Kiralfy's promenades filled with hatted Edwardians - but Cyril Connolly kept occurring to me: those words about closing time in the gardens of the west.</p>",
  "<p>Chris Iwelumo's car stereo reverberates to the sounds of Madame Butterfly and La Traviata rather than Jay-Z. Since last Saturday his own life has been tragi-comic soap opera, with the number of YouTube hits for his infamous miss against Norway approaching 200,000.</p> <p>The Wolves striker has been pilloried for one of the worst misses in the history of Scottish football, but at least he has managed to find a positive in a sea of negativity. Iwelumo is just glad he did not make his costly error in an England shirt, otherwise he is convinced his career would be as good as over.</p> <p>Raised in Coatbridge near Kilmarnock there are few prouder Scots, but never has Iwelumo been more grateful not to be English. \"If I had missed that chance playing for England? Oh God,\" he says. \"Multiply the stick I have had a hundred, thousand, million times. South of the border, you don't come back from that.\" </p> <p>Ashley Cole only misplaced a pass for England a few hours after Iwelumo's miss and he ran for cover, but the Wolves striker has answered so many questions about his miss reporters have even been apologising to him before asking them. Having gone to bed on Friday \"dreaming of being a hero\", he woke on Sunday to the start of a week of opprobrious coverage, all of which has riled the Wolves manager Mick McCarthy. The striker's family and friends have been trying to avoid the glare, too. \"It hurts me more that they are getting hounded about it,\" Iwelumo says, \"but there have been so many great emails from Scotland fans saying they are looking forward to me scoring against Holland [in March].\"</p> <p>His positive stance stems from far more important issues. The first people to embrace him last Sunday were his wife Bianca and four-year old daughter Prisais (Precious One). After being born 10 weeks prematurely, weighing only 2lb 4oz, Iwelumo doubted she would ever see him play the game, never mind do so for Scotland. \"I kiss her every day before I go to work,\" he admits. \"I am a lucky man.\"</p> <p>Iwelumo has been brave enough to watch the video of his miss and bemoans not being able to \"sort my feet out\" in time for a chance that he would accept 100 times out of 100 in training. \"If I score, what comes after would have been unbelievable. I get goose bumps just thinking about that,\" he adds. This season's six goals in five league games have all been far more difficult, and he wants to add to that total against Coventry City today.</p> <p>His motivation is twofold. Firstly to generate another three points towards his ambition of being a Premier League player next season, and also as he has his eyes set on Scotland's friendly with Argentina at Hampden Park next month. \"If the miss is ever to be forgotten, I have to get back on the bike.\" Iwelumo is counting the days until that chance.</p>",
  "<p>As Juande Ramos surveyed the wreckage of Tottenham Hotspur's latest defeat, at home to Hull City the Sunday before last, he expressed the hope that when his players came back from the international break \"their minds [would be] much better\".</p> <p>In the event, the majority of his squad did not leave the country with their various teams. It is a somewhat startling statistic that Tottenham had only seven full internationals on duty over the past week or so, and three more with England's Under-21s. The rest continued to report to the Spurs Lodge training ground and attempt to fathom why they are bottom of the Premier League and without a win in seven matches, their worst start to a season since 1912, the year the Titanic went down.</p> <p>It is a wearying process, one that has been written about and broadcast seemingly on loop with each of Tottenham's shock results. Ramos, though, is nothing if not pragmatic and after his period of reflection, he has returned with a clear acceptance of the situation facing the club. They are not words that he expected to utter two months into his first full season at White Hart Lane but yes, Tottenham are in a relegation battle and no, they are not too good to go down. </p> <p>\"This is the situation in this moment,\" he said in broken English, having resolved to speak the language to show that he is not running from any challenge. \"This is our mentality. In this moment, it's relegation and we need to work very hard to go up the table. I don't agree [that a team can be too good to go down]. If we can't win matches it's because we are not a good squad. It's only possible to show on the pitch. It's not possible to say 'he is very good' if he doesn't score goals. We need to improve. We have to show we are worthy to stay up and avoid relegation.\"</p> <p>Ramos insists he is only looking game to game and if that is the case, tomorrow's trip to Stoke City will have occupied his thoughts for the past fortnight. It is difficult to imagine a more hazardous fixture for a Tottenham team which is brittle in so many senses. \"We need to win at Stoke. All of the games are important because at the moment this is a serious situation for us,\" he said. \"I'm worried because we want to win but this is a normal situation we have had since the start of the season. We are working very hard.\"</p> <p>The Spaniard could be forgiven for lining up his squad against a wall and picking the 11 biggest to combat Stoke's physical threat. The indications are that he will play Tom Huddlestone in midfield and deem the 90 minutes important enough for the captain Ledley King to start, rather than save him for the Uefa Cup group tie at Udinese next Thursday. The right-back Alan Hutton has returned to training after overcoming a foot injury and might also return while Luka Modric, the midfielder, could be left on the bench. Yet Ramos insists that he will not sacrifice his principles. \"Fighting is difficult because Stoke are physically very strong,\" he said. \"We need to play football.\"</p> <p>King continues to be a headache. His limited availability because of chronic knee trouble could be seen to be undermining the quest for stability in central defence. The update that Ramos gave on his fitness was not encouraging. \"It's not possible for Ledley to train every day,\" he said. \"It's only possible for him to play every two or three weeks.\" </p> <p>Ramos's problems go far beyond one key player, though. The goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes apart, none of the club's seven other first-team summer signings have found any consistent form and the fixture list appears daunting. After next Saturday's home game against Bolton Wanderers, they have Arsenal (away), Liverpool (home) and Manchester City (away) in the Premier League. \"It's curious because the best game for us was [the 1-1 draw] against Chelsea. Maybe we prefer to play the big teams at this moment,\" offered Ramos. </p> <p>The chairman Daniel Levy does not want to sack him. \"I spoke to him yesterday and the meeting was very nice,\" Ramos added. \"We know the problem. We are speaking about looking for the solution.\" But Levy will not show ever-lasting patience. The forthcoming sequence will be pivotal. </p> <p>\"I'm sleeping fine, my mind is very calm,\" the manager said. \"The fans understand the situation with the new players [taking time to settle]. Football is similar to the [financial] markets. It is possible to go up and down. We hope the markets change and go up for us.\" </p> <p>The bail-out, however, needs to arrive quickly.</p> <h2>Seven days around the world for Tottenham</h2> <p><strong>International fortunes of Spurs' 22-man first-team squad last week</strong></p> <p><strong>Chris Gunter Wales </strong></p> <p>Played 90 minutes in the 2-0 home victory over Liechtenstein (Saturday) and 86 minutes of the 1-0 away defeatto Germany (Wednesday)</p> <p><strong>Vedran Corluka Croatia</strong></p> <p>Played 90 minutes in the 0-0 away draw against Ukraine (Saturday) and in the 4-0 home victory over Andorra (Wednesday)</p> <p><strong>Gareth Bale Wales</strong></p> <p>Played 90 minutes against Liechtenstein (Saturday) and in Germany (Wednesday)</p> <p><strong>Jermaine Jenas England</strong></p> <p>Selected in the squad but did not feature in either game</p> <p><strong>Luka Modric Croatia</strong></p> <p>Played 90 minutes against Ukraine (Saturday) and Andorra (Wednesday) in which he missed a penalty and scored</p> <p><strong>Tom Huddlestone England</strong></p> <p>Played in both legs of the Under-21s' 5-4 aggregate European Championship play-off victory over Wales.

The point at which the World Health Organisation recommends introducing solid foods is six months. Start by pureeing, and then graduate (as quickly as possible because the sooner babies get used to texture the better) to forking up and fingerfoods. The sooner you can let them make a mess and feed themselves the better. Some foods should be completely avoided for the first year: honey, egg whites (some health officials suggest avoiding the yolks too)and nuts. Not too much salt or chilli. Fruit juices too may cause stomach problems. Some avoid tomatoes, others don't. And that's it - you're off. It's really no more complicated than that. </p> <p>These rules don't exclude giving your baby little tastes of whatever you're eating from as young as four months. The thing to remember over and over again is that you are introducing them to your food. Not to jars of baby food (these certainly have their uses, but should only be used occasionally for convenience, not as the main source of food, otherwise you risk a child with a narrow and fussy palate); not to fromage frais, not to mashed banana forever, but to the foods that you like. Vegetables, mild curries, stews, omelettes, baked potatoes, all these and more make lovely food for baby too. This is where your freezer comes in handy: make up batches and freeze them in ice-cube trays. </p> <p>Here are a couple of very simple recipes which make lovely dinners for babies ...</p> <h2>Lorraine Kelly's cheesy lentil savoury</h2> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>2 tbsp red lentils<br>250ml water<br>1 carrot, peeled and sliced <br>1 small onion (finely chopped)<br>2 tbsp cheddar cheese (grated) </p> <p>Put the lentils, water and vegetables in a saucepan. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for about 30 minutes or until the lentils are quite mushy. Top up with a little more water during cooking, if necessary. Stir in the grated cheese. Puree or mash, adding a little milk if you want a thinner consistency. Serve lukewarm.</p> <h2>Gentle fish stew</h2> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>A piece of haddock: check very thoroughly for bones<br>Lump of butter<br>2 tbsp milk<br>1 small onion (grated)<br>1 medium tomato, (peeled and deseeded)</p> <p>Melt the butter and give the grated onion a few minutes to soften. Peel any skin off the haddock and then put the flesh in the pan with the tomatoes and the milk. Gently bring to the boil, then lower the heat and let it all cook very gently together for about ten minutes, turning the haddock over once or twice. Fork it all together, turn into a dish, and serve. </p> <h2>Top five great purees</h2> <p>\u00b7 Pumpkin<br>\u00b7 Pea<br>\u00b7 Root vegetable mix (carrots, parsnips, pumpkin, turnips)<br>\u00b7 Spinach and cream cheese<br>\u00b7 Celeriac and potato</p> <h2>Top five fingerfood combos</h2> <p>\u00b7 Carrots and hummus<br>\u00b7 Rice cakes and mashed avocado<br>\u00b7 The crusty part of a baguette<br>\u00b7 Asparagus spears and egg<br>\u00b7 Celery and cream cheese</p>",
  "<p>People of Great Britain: your pubs are under threat!\" No, not a line from a 1950s sci-fi flick, but the latest bulletin from the Campaign For Real Ale (Camra). According to new figures, up to 36 pubs are closing their doors every week, an increase even on the numbers for 2007, where a total of 1,409 pubs rang last orders for the final time. Although some of these premises will be reborn as gastropubs or undergo the indignity of a cosmetic nip'n'tuck to re-emerge as swanky cocktail bars, many will face the worst fate of all: being gutted and refitted for sale as flats or offices. It's not just our city centres that are beginning to look like pub graveyards, either. According to Camra's Iain Loe, \"For the first time since the Domesday Book, more than half our villages are without a pub.\" </p> <p>The victims of a triple whammy involving corporate pub chains, cheap supermarket booze and last year's smoking ban - a law which David Hockney described as \"destroying bohemia\"- local pubs across the UK are vanishing. While researching The Rough Pub Guide, I saw countless reminders of this disturbing shift: a once-proud army of Duke Of Wellingtons, Marquis Of Granbys and bedraggled Red Lions standing forlornly by the roadside, defeated by an invincible enemy. Such cultural vandalism has some alarming side-effects too, as a tour around some of the most iconic pubs from stage and screen reveals... </p> <h2>The Mother Black Cap</h2> <p><strong>Withnail And I, 1986</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Classic inner-city boozer where Withnail orders \"two large gins, two pints of cider. Ice in the cider\" as warm-up for an Olympian drinking binge. Local colour is provided by hardcase clientele, eager to vent frustrations on out of work actors. All together now: \"I called him a ponce. And now I'm calling you one. PONCE!\" </p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> After a brief spell spent bearing the name of the fictional pub, the film location is now The Tavistock, on Tavistock Crescent in London, W11, a minimalist gastropub where media types strain to hear each other over the sound of bleeping Blackberrys.</p> <h2>The Railway Arms</h2> <p><strong>Life On Mars, 2006</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Pub excelsis: nicotine-heavy hangout for Gene Hunt and the local CID where Slade are on the jukebox, KP peanuts are on the menu, and there's always a take-out option of Watney's Party Seven. Pubtopia.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Exterior scenes shot at the Angel Inn, Royton, Oldham. Mercifully still a traditional pub, although you hear a lot less Alvin Stardust these days.</p> <h2>The Winchester</h2> <p><strong>Shaun Of The Dead, 2004</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Boozy hub of Edgar Wright's genre-busting rom-zom-com where Shaun (Simon Pegg) and pals fight off lobotomised locals to the sound of Queen's Don't Stop Me Now blasting from the jukebox.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Based on Pegg's favourite pub, The Winchester on <br>Archway Road, N6 (itself since gastroed). The exterior scenes were shot at the Duke Of Albany in Bermondsey, now shut down and being converted into flats. The For Sale sign outside reads: \"One, two or three-bedroom apartments available including garden and duplex units.\"</p> <h2>The Kebab &amp; Calculator</h2> <p><strong>The Young Ones, 1982</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Featured in the infamous episode Boring, the K&amp;C brilliantly reflected a pre-alcopops climate where young drinkers were tolerated rather than tempted. Madness play live to an audience seemingly superglued to their chairs. Welcome to the house of fun, indeed.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Filmed at the Cock O' The North in Bristol, one of only a couple of circular pubs in Britain. The pub reopened following a complete refurbishment in May 2007, and is now called The Westbury Park Tavern.</p> <h2>The Slaughtered Lamb</h2> <p><strong>An American Werewolf In London, 1981</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Inhospitable rural local stumbled upon by ill-fated backpackers, complete with a pentangle on the wall and a cryptic Brian Glover: \"Beware the moon, lads!\" </p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Exterior shots of the \"Lamb\" were shot at a private house in Wales - but the interior scenes were shot at the Black Swan in Effingham, Surrey. A former bikers' pub, it was completely modernised in 2006. Bar snacks now include potted salmon with pickled cucumber.</p> <h2>The Jockey</h2> <p><strong>Shameless, 2004 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> The Star Wars cantina as re-imagined by Irvine Welsh, The Jockey exists as an alternative front room for northern antihero Frank Gallagher, who lives by the motto: \"Stop whingeing. Drink more!\"</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> The Wellington Inn, West Gorton - the inspiration for writer Paul Abbott- was used for exterior shots until 2007. It remains a diamond-hard bedrock of estate-pub fundamentalism. Its chances of being gastroed are remote, though plans are afoot to redevelop the whole area.</p> <h2>The Vick &amp; Comet</h2> <p><strong> Get Carter, 1971</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> An actual boozer on Neville Street in Newcastle. In the smoky Spit &amp; Vomit, heavy-lidded hood Jack Carter (Michael Caine) asserts cultural dominance over the flat-capped locals.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Now an O'Neill's Irish theme pub boasting notices reading \"Cead Mile Failte\" (\"One hundred thousand welcomes\"). As Carter might put it: \"The only reason I came back to this craphouse was to find out who did it.\"</p> <h2>The Coach &amp; Horses</h2> <p><strong>Last Orders, 2001</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Den of male pub solidarity, where Bob Hoskins, Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings sing songs and provide \"there's-something-in-my-eye\" reminiscences about departed friend Michael Caine.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Interiors shot at the Larkhill Tavern, Wandsworth, since closed. The exteriors were shot at the Wishing Well in Peckham, SE15; it recently had a makeover as part of Peckham's transformation from inner-city no-go zone to \"urban village\". Del Boy would choke on his cr\u00e8me de menthe cocktail.</p> <p>\u2022 The Rough Pub Guide by Paul Moody And Robin Turner (Orion) is out now</p>",
  "<p>\"Muuum, I'm hungry ... What's for dinner?\"</p> <p>The relationship between children and food should be simple - and fun. Yet often, it can be a source of stress. We worry about whether our little darlings are getting the right kind of grub. We worry about having time to cook, what to cook, and whether they will actually eat it when we do ...</p> <p>How to stop this endless fretting? The first step has to be to get yourself and your children into the kitchen on a regular basis. Cook, cook, cook, whatever comes to hand - eggs, pasta, bread, curries. Have glorious mash-ups with chocolate and ice-cream and fruit. Try a recipe you've never made before, and hold tasting sessions for a final verdict. Encourage your kids to see that food can be fun.</p> <p>As well as all the delicious recipe ideas in this guide (many of them simple enough to make with your children's help), we've asked some of our finest chefs and cookery writers about their children and food. And yes, the likes of Tana Ramsay, Ainsley Harriott, Annabel Karmel and Jane Fearnley-Whittingstall all have their worries, too. So don't fret - relax and enjoy two of the great pleasures of life: cooking and kids.</p>",
  "<p>Cobblers, crisps and crumbles! - as Billy Bunter's maiden aunt might have yelped if she stubbed her toe on the pine dresser. These words, however, should not be shouted as euphemistic expletives, but as a celebratory mantra for the myriad possibilities offered up by our native orchard fruits of autumn. Because even if you've got only 20 minutes or so to spare, today's recipes allow you to bring to the table something reliably crowd-pleasing and delicious.</p> <p>These homey puds are certainly not fine patisserie. They're designed not to seduce the eye so much as to have rural rumpy-pumpy with your tastebuds. And they're perfect for the pastry-challenged. There's no rolling, no wrestling with tricky dough, no blind baking. Just a bit of chopping and mixing stands between you and hot, fruity pleasure.</p> <p>The crumble is, rightly, a national institution. So it's surprising that we've only really been making them since the second world war. We've even exported them to France, where they can't get enough of \"le crumble\". Our humble, bumbling, tummy-rumbling crumble now rubs shoulders with cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and tarte au citron. And so it should.</p> <p>As for the crumble topping, you could add a few tablespoons of oats or try a combination of half caster sugar, half light muscovado sugar to ring the changes, or, as we usually do at River Cottage, substitute ground almonds for about a third of the flour. But here I've given you crumble in its purest form.</p> <p>And with that in mind... I hope we're not going to fall out about this, but I'm banning cinnamon. I know that for some the cinnamon/apple combo is a religion. Well, in that case, I'm an atheist. I want to revel in the delicious, sweet/tart fruit, and a heavy hand with the spice jar can leave the pud with all of the allure of a cheap scented candle. </p> <p>Crisps are an American incarnation of the crumble, and our transatlantic relatives must be praised for this bold, if rather sweet-toothed, innovation. They've made it, well, crisper, less crumbly, more chewy, by adding more butter, more sugar and often a few ground nuts - all changes worth ringing, once in a while.</p> <p>Cobblers. There, I've said it. Some say they get their name from being \"cobbled\" together or, more fancily, because the dollops of baked batter look like cobblestones, with the running juices of the fruit providing a deliciously sticky mortar. Whatever your combination of filling and topping, allow the molten fruit to cool for a few minutes before serving with custard, thick, yellow cream or, if you're a modernist at heart, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or Greek yogurt.</p> <p>And don't be shy of making these big-hearted puds for small, intimate gatherings. A little cold crumble, crisp or cobbler is one of life's most indulgent breakfasts. </p> <h2>Apple crumble</h2> <p>Squeeze together some of the crumble mix to form little lumps before scattering it over the fruit - this makes the topping crunchy as well as crumbly. Serves six to eight.</p> <p><strong>180g plain flour</strong><br><strong>120g unsalted butter, chilled and cut into cubes</strong><br><strong>160g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>1kg Bramley apples</strong><br><strong>Zest of \u00bd lemon</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp fresh lemon juice</strong><br><strong>1-2 tbsp water</strong></p> <p>Put the flour and butter in a bowl and rub together with your fingertips until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs (or pulse it in a food processor). Tip in 80g of the sugar and mix. Refrigerate while you assemble the rest. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.</p> <p>Peel and core the apples, and cut the flesh into large chunks. Toss the apples with the lemon zest and juice, the remaining caster sugar and the water. Tip into a shallow, ovenproof dish. </p> <p>Scatter the topping over the apples, squishing some of it into small chunks as you go, then bake for about 40 minutes, until golden. Serve with whipped cream, custard or ice-cream.</p> <h2>Pear and raisin crisp</h2> <p>Though this is quick to make, it's best to soak the raisins overnight. If you don't have time for that, put them in a pan with the brandy and warm through very gently. Remove from the heat and after half an hour or so they will be plump enough to cook with. Serves six to eight.</p> <p><strong>100g raisins</strong><br><strong>200ml cider apple brandy</strong><br><strong>70g plain flour</strong><br><strong>50g light muscovado sugar</strong><br><strong>50g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>1-2 grinds nutmeg</strong><br><strong>1 good pinch salt</strong><br><strong>75g unsalted butter, chilled and cut into cubes</strong><br><strong>60g ground almonds </strong><br><strong>1kg medium pears</strong><br><strong>Zest of \u00bd lemon </strong><br><strong>1\u00bd tbsp fresh lemon juice</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp caster sugar</strong></p> <p>Soak the raisins in the brandy for a good few hours, or overnight (or plump them as outlined above). Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. </p> <p>Put the flour, sugars, nutmeg and salt into a food processor, and pulse to combine. Add the butter, and pulse a few times more, until it resembles coarse sand. Add the almonds, and pulse a few more times, until everything is well combined and resembles slightly clumpy wet sand - don't over-process or it will become too moist when cooked. Chill for 15 minutes.</p> <p>Peel and core the pears. Slice the flesh quite thickly and toss with the lemon zest and juice, sugar and drained raisins. Tip into an oven-proof dish and sprinkle the topping evenly over the lot. Bake for 40 minutes, until golden and bubbling.</p> <h2>Apple, orange and quince cobbler</h2> <p>If you can't get hold of quince, use an extra half-kilo of apples instead. That said, though, this combination is so delicious it's well worth hunting a few down. Serves six to eight.</p> <p><strong>1kg Bramley apples</strong><br><strong>500g quince</strong><br><strong>100g butter</strong><br><strong>100g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>2 oranges</strong><br><strong>225g self-raising flour</strong><br><strong>2 tsp baking powder</strong><br><strong>100g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>1 pinch salt</strong><br><strong>80g unsalted butter, chilled and cut into cubes</strong><br><strong>1 large egg yolk</strong><br><strong>120ml buttermilk (or milk to which 1 tsp lemon juice has been added)</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp whole milk</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp granulated sugar</strong></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Peel and core the apples and quince, and cut the flesh into chunks. Melt the butter in a big saucepan and saut\u00e9 the fruit with the caster sugar and the zest from one of the oranges until it has slightly softened, about five minutes. Peel and segment the oranges, and stir these in. Spoon the mixture into an ovenproof dish. </p> <p>Sift the flour, baking powder, 100g of sugar and salt into a bowl, add the butter and rub together until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs (or pulse in a food processor). Whisk the egg yolk with the buttermilk, add to the flour bowl and work into a soft, sticky dough (don't overwork it). Drop spoonfuls of dough on top of the fruit, leaving small gaps in between, and brush all over with milk. Sprinkle the sugar on top and bake for 30-35 minutes, until bubbling and golden. Leave to cool slightly before serving.</p> <p>\u2022 Watch out for River Cottage Autumn on Channel 4, starting at 8pm next Thursday.</p>",

  "<p>A good week to bury good news. During the financial crisis, ministers have inverted New Labour's notorious first law of spin. On Monday the pernicious plan to imprison suspects for 42 days was decisively dumped. On Tuesday sinister plans for secret inquests with no jury were quietly put on ice. The same afternoon the children's secretary, Ed Balls, finally listened to the critics' chorus - which came from parents, teachers and educationists alike - and axed the hated Sats for 14-year olds, which are mandatory in England.</p> <p>The tests were introduced in 1993, with three aims: injecting rigour into education, assessing pupil performance and monitoring schools. As a gauge of schools, the 14-plus was always superfluous - the benchmarks that mattered were tests at 11 for primary level, and GCSEs for the secondary phase. By this summer, when botched administration by the outsourcing firm ETS Europe resulted in 1 million pupils getting their marks late, it was painfully plain that the 14-plus tests were serving no purpose at all. The chaos catalysed a new wave of resentment, one which proved as powerful as it did only because of deeper anxieties.</p> <p>Arguably, ETS Europe ended up with the contract precisely because the tests had little educational rationale: two of the three big exam boards thought marking the scripts was a box-ticking exercise, and so declined to bid for the work. More fundamentally, the run of formal exams - at 11, 14, 16, 17 and 18 - reduced schooling to a series of hurdles. That system has made youngsters unduly anxious and - as university teachers increasingly complain - produces school-leavers who are less comfortable with thinking for themselves than being spoon-fed with exam technique. Tony Blair's former right-hand man, Matthew Taylor, recently summed up the consensus neatly: \"Too many schools are drab, joyless assessment factories.\"</p> <p>Ditching the uniform Sats at age 14 is a welcome response to this reality, as is the accompanying suggestion of a report card for schools, which would cover extra-curricular activities as well as exam results. Questions remain about the tests at 11, which suffer from similar defects. Outright abolition is trickier here, as these do have a role, albeit a questionable one, in assessing primary schools. If these tests are to be retained, though, there must be a rapid move from the stressful one-size-fits-all regime towards a new model - which is already being trialled - that lets teachers decide the level at which individual pupils are ready to be tested. </p> <p>The unexamined life, Socrates said, is not worth living. This week ministers belatedly recognised that the overexamined life of the young is not as worthwhile as it should be.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338746136\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1863394598_US-Elections-LT-Obama-Roanoke-To-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Sam, the hotel waiter, wasn't at breakfast yesterday morning. For the three weeks I have been in Roanoke we have talked politics together over the buffet most days.</p> <p>But yesterday was different. Barack Obama was coming to town, and Sam was going to be there. \"I've got to go,\" he said. \"That's going to be our next president.\"</p> <p>All over Roanoke people were making preparations. Meghan, an Obama volunteer, asked me what I thought she should wear. Students at Patrick Henry high school were discussing taking the day off. Three hours before Obama's scheduled appearance, hundreds of people were queuing in the rain. It seemed like almost everybody in town wanted to be there.</p> <p>It is a stark change from the day I arrived at the end of last month. Back then, the Dow index opened at 11,139, Obama and John McCain were tied in the polls in the state, and most local Democrats were still in the closet.</p> <p>Roanoke sits like a tiny Democratic island in a sea of staunch Republican waters. Culturally and economically the city dominates the region; but politically it is completely surrounded. Just three weeks ago, Obama supporters in a nearby town were asking the local Democratic campaign organiser not to reveal their affiliations publicly for fear of being ostracised.</p> <p>At Pop's Ice-cream and Soda Bar, patrons discussed their support for Obama in hushed tones until they spotted an Obama sign on the popcorn machine. \"Oh, it's OK,\" one said out loud. \"They have an Obama poster.\"</p> <p>When you asked black people if they thought whites in the state would support a black candidate they responded with a lengthy pause, and then equivocation. </p> <p>\"They should,\" said one woman after what seemed like an age. \"If they're paying attention.\"</p> <p>\"But do you think they actually will?\" I asked. Pause. \"I don't know,\" she said.</p> <p>As I prepared to leave the town yesterday, the Dow was down 25%, Obama was up in Virginia by 5% and Democrats were out and proud as Obama addressed a capacity crowd at the local civic centre.</p> <p>This gathering in confidence has been slow but definite. There was an art auction, Fine Art to Elect a Fine Man, which raised $4,100. Last weekend Bill Clinton visited the town. One night this week, more than 30 new volunteers showed up to the opening of a new campaign office just outside Roanoke.</p> <p>And, yesterday, the man himself - the first visit from a presidential candidate to Roanoke since JFK in 1960. In contrast, Republicans are still waiting for a high-profile visit. And it's not clear that they would be overjoyed to see McCain anyway. Most of the people I spoke to at a Republican vice-presidential debate-watching party had not voted for McCain in the primaries, but had been energised by the nomination of Sarah Palin.</p> <p><strong>Hard fight</strong><br>\"Republicans were OK with McCain, but not excited,\" explained James Mixon, sporting a badge saying \"Sarah!\" with the words \"McCain and Palin\" much smaller underneath. </p> <p>\"He's come on strong since then and by nominating Palin he's indicated to conservatives that he's serious.\"</p> <p>Republicans are not used to fighting this hard in Virginia - a state that has not voted Democrat in more than 40 years. One man confided that he believed McCain could not win the presidency if he didn't take the state. </p> <p>Roanoke is a pretty town, sitting in a valley between the Appalachians and the Blue Ridge mountains, divided by route 581 from north to south, the railroad tracks from east to west and by race and class throughout.</p> <p>Crudely speaking, the south-east is poor and white, the south-west is affluent and white, the north-west is black, and the north-east more of a mix.</p> <p>The same things that dominate the national political conversation play out locally, only differently. Economically, the area has never experienced the highs or lows of the national booms and busts. But they are still feeling it. The food bank has seen a 9% increase in those seeking assistance. Last week the state announced it would axe 1,400 jobs. The week before the nearby university, Virginia Tech, raised its tuition fees by 11%.</p> <p>Healthcare is also a big issue here. Once a railroad town, Roanoke is now dominated by the healthcare giant Carilion. Around 40% of the judgments in Roanoke general district court since 2003 have been brought by Carilion, chasing people who cannot pay their medical bills.</p> <p>David Crimmins is one of them. He was treated for a herniated disc 10 years ago and ended up with a $5,000 bill. Crimmins, who earns $15,000 a year, did not show up to court to challenge Carilion's action. </p> <p>\"I didn't see the point,\" he said. \"They're going to do whatever they want anyhow.\" The debt to Carilion was deducted from his wages until the company finally relented.</p> <p>The hospital is also deducting owed money from his sister's wages and his mother's pay packet. So many are the debt collection actions before the court that it sets aside one day a week just to deal with healthcare. They call it Carilion day.</p> <p>Otherwise, Democrats here are more likely to talk about the war, and Republicans more about tax, socialism and guns. With the registration deadline past, Democratic areas have seen at least double the increase in new voters compared with Republican areas. The task now is to get them out.</p> <p><strong>Mood shift</strong><br>And in some quarters, excitement at the possibility of Obama's election has been tinged with a sense of alienation from his campaign. Leaders in the black community believe the young, white out-of-town staffers are ignoring their local knowledge and connections which could result in an under-performance of the black vote. African Americans comprise a quarter of the city and a fifth of the state - Obama cannot win the city or the state without them.</p> <p>\"The older crowd just don't connect with a 20-year-old white person telling a 50-year-old black person what to do,\" said Onzlee Ware, the Virginia House delegate for Roanoke. \"Especially how to run their own communities. And then they get discouraged and go back to their communities.\"</p> <p>Ware said there was time to turn things round by election day. If there was a doubt in his mind about Obama winning, he was not showing it. </p> <p>It's a mark of the mood shift these last three weeks. The pauses are shorter. The polls show the Democrat nomination up. And yesterday lunchtime there were no whispered conversations at Pop's. The owners had shut up shop and gone to see Obama.</p> <h2><strong>Local Voices</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Onzlee Ware</strong>, delegate to the Virginia legislature </p> <p>Ware is the most senior black politician in town. He is convinced that Obama will win. He said: \"The thing I like about this campaign is that America has said that there's an entire America. Not just a white male America. But a black America and a female America.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Chelsea Shinneman</strong>, Obama volunteer </p> <p>Shinneman is not so much a volunteer for Obama as an evangelist for him. She devotes pretty much every waking hour when she's not working to the campaign, so much so that her voicemail message also gives the Obama <br>office number.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>David Crimmins</strong>, painter </p> <p>David Crimmins, a painter, lives with his girlfriend, Melissa Hicks, who has never left Virginia, and their two boys. They want McCain to win. \"He's got the experience,\" he says. Hicks says she does not know why she does not like Obama but it is not because he is black.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Anna Robertson</strong>, owner of Pop's Ice-cream and Soda Bar </p> <p>Robertson sends both her children to the local school, where half the pupils are black. \"People would ask me how I felt about my kids going to school in Roanoke as though the schools were really bad. The racial element of it is always unspoken. But it's there.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 23 2008.

  "<p>The government is facing a winter of disruption to public services as hundreds of thousands of civil servants today backed national industrial action for at least three months over pay.</p> <p>The move by members of the Public and Commercial Services union heralds industrial action across government departments and agencies, including courts, coastguards and immigration centres. </p> <p>As the country prepares for a rising unemployment toll in the face of the credit crunch, jobcentre staff who help people find jobs and secure social benefit will also be among the staff who walk out.</p> <p>The union, which represents 270,000 workers in the UK, said 54% of those taking part in the ballot backed industrial action.</p> <p>The union's executive will meet next Thursday to decide dates for a programme of industrial action which could last for the rest of the year. </p> <p>The union said the yes vote came as civil servants faced mounting pressure on their finances because of the government's 2% pay cap. </p> <p>Mark Serwotka, its general secretary, said: \"With a quarter of the civil service earning less than \u00a316,500 and thousands earning just above the minimum wage, the government's policy of capping public sector pay has hit some of the lowest paid in the public sector the hardest, leading to real-terms pay cuts and pay freezes. <br> Serwotka said his members felt \"betrayed\" by ministers.</p> <p>\"Pay freezes and real-terms pay cuts are simply not sustainable when you are earning a pittance and experiencing double-digit rises in food, fuel and housing costs. Bailing out bankers should not be at the expense of those who deliver public services or those who rely on them. </p> <p>He added: \"The government have a window of opportunity to avert industrial action and to recognise that their public-sector pay cap is compounding the financial misery of hardworking families in these unstable economic times.\" </p> <p>The PCS has held a series of pay strikes this year which have hit jobcentres, passports, immigration and coastguards across the UK, as well as the Scottish courts service and museums.</p>",
  "<p>Ernst Krenek composed no less than 21 operas - 11 in Europe before the outbreak of the second world war, and another 10 after he settled in the US - but just two, Jonny Spielt Auf and Karl V, now have even the vaguest toehold in the repertory. What Price Confidence? is one of the forgotten ones, a chamber opera for four voices with piano that Krenek completed in 1945 to his own English libretto. Set in late Victorian London, it's the slightly unexpected story of two young couples who end up swapping partners, and both the text and the music are laced with jokey references to Britain. Schoenberg's one-act comedy Von Heute auf Morgen seems to have been Krenek's model; but his word setting is functionally syllabic rather than lyrical, and the 12-note piano accompaniment dry, never expansive. It is decently sung here, but remains just a curiosity; the three sets of songs that complete the disc are more impressive, but, frustratingly, go undocumented in the sleeve notes.</p>",
  "<p>\"Come on you greens!\" No, this is not a new battle cry to rouse the eco-minded folk among us. It happens to be the closest I can get living in Cornwall to hearing either a Football League or Premier League chant. <br><br>Yes, <a href=\"http://www.pafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Welcome\">Plymouth Argyle</a> are based in the neighbouring county of Devon (boo, hiss), but that doesn't stop the Penzance-to-Plymouth trains filling up with Cornish supporters wearing green shirts on the Saturdays when the <a href=\"http://www.plymouthargyle-mad.co.uk/\">Pilgrims</a> are playing at home.</p> <p>The irony, of course, is that the Pilgrims are far from being green in the environmental sense. Due to being located deep in the West Country, they are probably the most travelled set of supporters in the entire Football League. Just think about what those poor Pilgrims will have to endure in two weeks time. </p> <p>The Championship fixture computer has dictated that on Tuesday, October 28, they play <a href=\"http://www.swfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Welcome\">Sheffield Wednesday</a> away in the league, then just four days later they return to the Steel City to play <a href=\"http://www.sufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Welcome\">Sheffield United</a>. Those two return journeys mean the Pilgrims will have to travel 948 miles in four days. And two weeks later it's <a href=\"http://www.ccfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Welcome\">Coventry City</a> away. (Just think if they were playing in Europe, too. OK, now I'm getting carried away.)</p> <p>But if there were a league of environmental purity for football teams, who would be champions? It's a question being asked in the forthcoming edition of <a href=\"http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/Default.aspx?tabid=62&amp;EntryID=240\">Ethical Consumer</a> magazine. It largely sticks to assessing Premier League sides, but the results are interesting nonetheless. When looking at just the environmental credentials of the stadium alone, then <a href=\"http://www.mcfc.co.uk/\">Manchester City</a>'s Eastlands comes out top with its recycling initiatives, on-site electric vehicles, and experiments with rainwater toilets and solar energy. (Apparently, plans to install an <a href=\"http://www.ecotricity.co.uk/projects/plan_mcfc.html\">85-metre wind turbine</a> to power the stadium are on hold due to fears about ice falling from the blades in winter!)</p> <p>\"Most significantly,\" says Ethical Consumer, \"Man City has also worked with the local council and public transport providers to co-ordinate buses and trains and to promote safe walking and cycling routes. According to Pete Bradshaw, head of corporate responsibility at the club, this has led to a 50% cut in the number of parking spaces needed, with over 70% of fans coming to matches on foot or by bus.\" (Non-league <a href=\"http://www.dartford.gov.uk/princespark/\">Dartford</a> actually gets the top marks for its new \"eco stadium\" which collects 20,000 litres of rainwater a day to water its pitch.) </p> <p>But haven't Man City just been bought up by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/01/manchestercity.premierleague\">Abu Dhabi United Group</a>, which is owned by the emirate's oil-rich family? How does that affect Man City's eco rating? Well, Ethical Consumer has also assessed the clubs in terms of the environmental and ethical credentials of their owners. Needless to say, most of the Premiership clubs fare pretty badly on this front with their rag-tag mix of super-rich owners, many of whom, according to the magazine, have their fingers in all manner of unethical pies. </p> <p>In fact, none of the Premier League teams achieve an \"<a href=\"http://www.ethiscore.org/\">ethiscore</a>\" higher than 10 out of 20. Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers, Hull City, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth, Stoke City, Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion and Wigan all achieve this \"winning\" score. However, it's not the Big Four that prop up the table (Arsenal, 9; Man Utd 8.5; Liverpool, 8; Chelsea, 8), but <a href=\"http://www.rovers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Home/0,,10303,00.html\">Blackburn Rovers</a> who score just 6 out of 20. They are marked down for being \"majority controlled by a trust representing the Walker family, whose money came from enterprises including Flybe and steel manufacturing\".</p> <p>Ethical Consumer rounds off its analysis with a grading of the teams according to the ethics of their principal sponsors. <a href=\"http://www.stokecityfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Welcome\">Stoke City</a> win big (13 out of 20) by having Britannia Building Society emblazoned across their players' chests, whereas Arsenal and Man Utd prop up the bottom of the table for once for having Emirates and AIG on their shirts \u2013 two companies that the magazine has roundly criticised in the past.</p> <p>Ranking teams by ethics rather than goals scored is an illuminating experiment, but it has one obvious flaw: as a rule (yes, we all know the exceptions), people don't shop around for the best football clubs like they do with, say, supermarkets or energy suppliers. We're lumbered with the clubs we grew up supporting. Football is a logic-free zone, and will remain so. Despite all the protests about the often whimsical and illogical decision-making by owners (see Newcastle's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/02/newcastleunited.premierleague\">treatment of Kevin Keegan</a> and Man City's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/02/premierleague.manchestercity\">treatment of Sven-Goran Eriksson</a> in recent months), very few fans ever boycott or change their club.</p>",

  "<p>Labour has nearly doubled its lead over the Tories on economic competence, according to the latest opinion poll, published on the day in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> accused <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> of presiding over a \"complete and utter failure\" of economic policy.</p> <p>Cameron used a hard-hitting speech to the City of London to shore up his economic credentials following another week in which Brown received widespread praise for his handling of the banking collapse both in Britain and abroad.</p> <p>But Cameron's attempt to steal the limelight today was undermined by the findings of a ComRes survey for BBC2's Daily Politics show that showed the Tories trailing by 11 points. </p> <p>Of the thousand people surveyed, 42% considered Brown and his chancellor, Alistair Darling, the politicians they \"trust most to steer Britain's economy through the current downturn\". </p> <p>While Labour went up two points, the Conservative leader and the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, dropped three points to 31%. </p> <p>Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, and his Treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, were up two at 7%, while almost one in five (19%) said they did not know. </p> <p>Cameron today outlined his plans for economic responsibility to replace \"irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible government\" under Labour. </p> <p>He began his attack by accusing the prime minister of basing his financial decisions on \"false assumptions\" that he said had left the economy in ruins.</p> <p>Among them were the ideas that a successful economy could be built on a \"narrow base of housing, public spending and financial services\" and \"that you could abolish boom and bust, and that the good times would last forever\".</p> <p>The Conservative leader said it was up to his party to \"fix\" the economy that Labour had broken.</p> <p>He dismissed critics who believed that \"permanent state intervention\" was the only way to avoid a repeat of the problems.</p> <p>Those who believed the change the country needed was a \"turn to the left\" were wrong, he said, as he promised to inject greater responsibility into the economy through a centre-right platform of measures. </p> <p>Cameron said the Tories had only supported the recapitalisation of banks to minimise the economic downturn because the only thing worse than state aid for banks \"is doing nothing\".</p> <p>\"Some people think that this decision - to support recapitalisation - means that we somehow now subscribe to the government's entire economic policy and doctrine.</p> <p>\"Let me make it crystal clear: we do not. And the complete and utter failure of their economic record has never been more clear to see.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101603179.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">Brown said today in an article in the Washington Post</a> that the credit crunch would prove to be the \"defining moment for the world economy\", one which presented an opportunity to create new rules for the global economy.</p> <p>The problems experienced in the world's money markets over the last few weeks were the first financial crisis of the new global age, the prime minister wrote.</p> <p>Cameron said New Labour had allowed the boom to go on for too long because having previously opposed free-market economics, the party had decided to accept it without questioning or understanding how it really worked. </p> <p>He charted Brown's comments on the city over the past four years. \"Only last year, he was celebrating what he called a 'golden age for the City of London', now he's describing that very same time an 'age of irresponsibility' \u2026 Does Gordon Brown really think he's going to get away with that? He cannot hide his mistakes. He cannot hide from the truth.\"</p> <p>Cameron said the economy did not need more freedoms, but more responsibility. \"Just as this party under my leadership has stood for social responsibility, now it must stand also for economic responsibility.\"</p> <p>A Tory government would introduce discipline in government - \"saying no more than yes\" and living within its means. </p> <p>Cameron outlined measures to help repair the economy. These included no promises of upfront tax cuts that could not be delivered, tougher regulation of the banking sector and changes to the insolvency laws to protect sound but struggling businesses.</p> <p>The Tory leader also hit out at \"unsustainable\" immigration-fuelled growth and the demise of manufacturing jobs. </p> <p>\"We've got to broaden our economic base to include more science, more hi-tech services, more green technologies, more engineering and more high-value manufacturing, drawing upon a much wider range of industries, markets, people, towns and cities.\"</p> <p>He promised a new debt responsibility mechanism, with the Bank of England required to write regularly to the Financial Services Authority about sustainability of the level of debt in the economy.</p> <p>\"If the level of debt is growing unsustainably, the bank will instruct the FSA to ensure banks either slow their lending or put aside more capital.\"</p> <p>An independent office of budget responsibility would hold the government to account and monitor its decisions on tax and spending, and \"proper responsible regulation\" would govern the banking system. </p> <p>Cameron called for a cultural change in the banking sector and a review of the incentives driving the sector. \"No longer must they think just that because they are abiding by the rules, morality goes out the window,\" he said.</p> <p>Cameron has previously pledged to fix Britain's \"broken society\", the environment, and what he claims is a broken political system. </p> <p>Asked in a press conference which repair job he would focus on first, he said: \"The truth is that the economy is going to be the most important issue for any government to get to grips with. We need change in order to mend the broken economy and this government cannot do it because they are not prepared to accept any mistakes over what has happened.\"</p> <p>He said taxes could not come down as long as the high costs of broken society continued. This made fixing the economy and society inextricably linked.</p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, branded Cameron's speech another \"short-term gimmick\" by the Tories.</p> <p>\"At a time when the British people want calm leadership and serious policies to get through tougher times, David Cameron is engaged in playing juvenile political games,\" she said.</p> <p>Clegg accused Cameron of a return to the \"Punch and Judy\" politics he once claimed to have rejected. </p> <p>\"I think it's the worst kind of politics,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. </p> <p>\"Two weeks ago David Cameron said he was a man with a plan, and yet he takes this opportunity of a speech to say nothing of any real material substance on what is the biggest economic crisis facing this country for decades. </p> <p>\"What I find so disappointing about David Cameron's speech is that it's all yah-boo, Punch and Judy, throwing around insults.\"</p> <p>Asked about Cameron's comments, Brown said: \"My undivided attention is on taking this country through the difficult times as a result of a global problem that started in America. I think the whole country wants everybody who can to work together through these difficult challenges. </p> <p>\"We are rebuilding the banking system. We are working to ensure that people with small businesses are helped and we are trying to make sure that we restart the housing market.

  "<p>With the potential repercussions of the global financial crisis still hard to imagine, Middle East commentators have begun to wonder how the economic turmoil will affect the region and particularly the chances to achieve success in the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, or Israel and Syria. Unsurprisingly, the outlook seems gloomy: it isn't just that the money needed to bolster any peace agreement will probably be much more difficult to raise, but there is also the concern that politicians preoccupied with urgent economic problems will have little time and energy left to focus on the pursuit of peace. </p> <p>Against this backdrop, the idealistic view that peace is priceless is already beginning to look like a luxury, because realistically, peace won't come cheap. As Herb Keinon <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com /servlet/Satellite?cid=\" 1222017521893&amp;pagename=\"JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&quot;&quot;\">put it bluntly</a> in the Jerusalem Post: </p> <blockquote> <p>The disappearance of trillions of dollars worldwide will \u2026 make it difficult for the international community to pay for an Israeli-Palestinian, or Israeli-Syrian, agreement, even if they miraculously appear. Who would pay for the tens of billions of dollars worth of new early-warning systems Israel would have to set up following deep withdrawals from the West Bank and Jordan Valley, or a complete withdrawal \u2026 from the Golan Heights? Who would pay compensation to Palestinian refugees if an agreement were reached that would deny them a \"right of return\" to pre-1967 Israel, but would recognise their right to compensation? Who would pay for the Palestinian security services or fund the infrastructure if a Palestinian state were agreed upon? </p> </blockquote> <p>But while there is <a href=\"http://www.washtimes.com/news/2008/oct/13/financial-crisis-seen-dooming-mideast-accord/\">widespread pessimism</a> about the impact of the current financial crisis on the Middle East peace process, the tendency to focus now on the costs of peace could all too easily result in a miscalculation, because the status quo also comes with a price tag attached. Earlier this month, Israeli prime minister-designate Tzipi Livni argued in her first <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/10/05/news/ML-Israel-Palestinians.php\">foreign policy speech</a> since her appointment to form a new government that Israel must press ahead with peace talks because \"doing nothing has its own price\". The \"price\" Livni had in mind was primarily a political one, namely a strengthening of extremist forces in the region; yet, such a development could obviously also entail a very real price tag in terms of defense spending. </p> <p>As expensive as peace may seem in the current economic crisis, it is hard to believe that giving up on the peace process now could turn out to be somehow more \"affordable\". While the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations initiated almost a year ago in Annapolis have not yet produced any tangible results and expectations for a breakthrough by the end of this year are very low, there have been some positive developments away from the limelight. Some of these developments were <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/10/110954.htm\">highlighted</a> by secretary of state Condoleezza Rice at the Palestinian Business and Investment Forum in Washington on Tuesday. The meeting was organised by the US-Palestinian Partnership, which was <a href=\"http://www.uspalestinianpartnership.org/site/c.kjJQJ7MSIuE/b.4113019/k.AFFB/About.htm\">established</a> in the wake of last year's Annapolis meeting to stimulate investment and promote economic development in the West Bank. It is easy to belittle such initiatives as a mere palliative, since the large-scale economic development needed in the Palestinian territories will continue to depend on the progress made in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations; at the same time, it is clear that risking the momentum that has been created would be costly in more than one sense.</p> <p>Unfortunately, given the current economic turmoil, concerns that the peace process may falter due to a lack of funding and a lack of the necessary sense of urgency and engagement seem all too justified. But perhaps this is also a good moment to draw attention to the plans of a billionaire who has decided to dedicate himself to \"the business of peace\". According to a <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1014151.html\">Ha'aretz report</a> from August, Daniel Abraham has \"a practical, financial proposal for solving the Palestinian refugee problem \u2013 an offer even Benjamin Netanyahu would have trouble refusing\". Abraham's plan is apparently still a tightly-guarded secret, and one can only hope that it has not been rendered impractical by the recent developments in the global financial markets. But in any case, even a pricey peace must seem like a real bargain compared to the almost unlimited resources that are so often required to wage war.</p>",
  "<p>Politics is about many things \u2013 the words you speak, the understanding you have of the problems we face, the vision you have, the policies you draw up and your ability to implement them.</p> <p>But all of those rest on the shoulders of one thing \u2013 the decisions and judgement calls you make.</p> <p>One important judgement call for us as an Opposition Party was whether to support the re-capitalisation of our banks with billions of pounds of taxpayers' money.</p> <p>We did support that \u2013 and my Party backed the decision, united and strong.</p> <p>Of course the details of the deal should be discussed robustly.</p> <p>This includes looking at the Government's confusion over returning to 2007 lending levels and the debate over dividends.</p> <p>But some people think that this decision - to support recapitalisation - means that we somehow now subscribe to the Government's entire economic policy and doctrine.</p> <p>Let me make it crystal clear \u2013 we do not.</p> <p>And the complete and utter failure of their economic record has never been more clear to see.</p> <p>This crisis has highlighted just how mistaken Labour's economic policy has been.</p> <p>The economic assumptions that Gordon Brown made in the last decade now lie in ruins.</p> <p>His assumption that a government could preserve stability while running a budget deficit in a boom.</p> <p>His assumption that global financial integration reduced, rather than increased, the risks in our domestic economy.</p> <p>His assumption that you could build a sustainable economy on a narrow base of housing, public spending, and financial services.</p> <p>His assumption that we could permanently spend more than our income and build an economy on debt.</p> <p>His assumption that you could abolish boom and bust and that the good times would last forever.</p> <p>Now we can see that each of his assumptions were false.</p> <p>Any proper consideration of what the policies of the last decade have produced leads us to three simple words.</p> <p>We need change. </p> <p>What's happened over the last ten years is that Labour has broken our economy \u2013 and we must fix it.</p> <p>Some have argued that the lesson of this crisis \u2013 and indeed of these years - is that the free enterprise economy is now deprived of legitimacy, and that only increased, permanent state intervention can save us from a repetition of the problems we face.</p> <p>These critics also assert that the centre-right has no solution and the change we need is a turn to the left.</p> <p>They are wrong.</p> <p>My argument today is that the change we need is the modern Conservatism that I have been advocating.</p> <p>In Birmingham a few weeks ago I explained that the central political idea underlying my Conservatism is the idea of responsibility.</p> <p>Not freedom, which some may wrongly assume is the animating force of Conservatism \u2013 but responsibility.</p> <p>The problem with freedom is that it can too easily tip over into licence \u2013 the idea that people can do whatever they please regardless of the consequences for others.</p> <p>And that is exactly what has happened to our economy.</p> <p>Over the past decade, we have seen a total breakdown of economic responsibility.</p> <p>From the government, as it has spent and borrowed without restraint.</p> <p>And from our financial sector, which has taken decisions which have harmed the rest of our economy. </p> <p>So it is not more freedom that our economy needs; it is more responsibility.</p> <p>Just as this Party under my leadership has stood for social responsibility, now it must stand also for economic responsibility.</p> <p>We've had irresponsible capitalism presided over by irresponsible government.</p> <p>Instead, what we need is responsible free enterprise, regulated and supported by responsible government.</p> <p>Today, I want to set out how we got to where we are \u2013 financial crisis and economic downturn.</p> <p>I will show how a responsible government should act to mitigate the immediate effects of the crisis.</p> <p>Because though Gordon Brown is trying to rescue the banks, we now need a plan to rescue the economy.</p> <p>And I will show what we need to do to establish the centre-right alternative, which consists of fiscal responsibility, financial responsibility and a balanced economy.</p> <p>The crisis that we face has deep roots.</p> <p>We all know the simplistic version.</p> <p>People in America were given sub-prime mortgages they couldn't afford.</p> <p>The banks devised new ways of chopping up debt and selling it on.</p> <p>No one understood the assets they were buying.</p> <p>So when the merry-go-around stopped, it all came tumbling down.</p> <p>That's all true.</p> <p>But it's only half the truth.</p> <p>It's only by understanding the deeper causes of this crisis that can we hope to find the long-term cures.</p> <p>The underlying dynamic was this global boom presented those in charge of economic management in Britain with a temptation\u2026</p> <p>\u2026and they succumbed to it.</p> <p>And the result was a combination of irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible government that has brought us to instability and our present crisis.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, two billion people - a third of the world's population - left subsistence agriculture and joined the global economy. </p> <p>The result was cheaper goods for all of us in the west, and an enormous increase in wealth among those who began to trade. </p> <p>It's why some economists call the Consumer Price Index - or CPI - the \"China Price Index\".</p> <p>The new middle classes in the east, and their governments, saved a huge proportion of their new wealth. </p> <p>For example in China, for a time, the average family saved over half its income. </p> <p>These savings were invested in the West, giving us and our governments the licence to borrow from overseas like never before. </p> <p>In Britain we took advantage of this new debt without stopping to think of the consequences. </p> <p>In other words, the emerging economies offered us a cheap loan, and we borrowed and spent like there was no tomorrow. </p> <p>Low inflation meant that interest rates could stay low and the financial system found new ways of channelling this flood of money into asset prices and debt.</p> <p>Government made things worse.</p> <p>The Chancellor who prided himself on prudence came to believe that he uniquely in the history of economics had ended the trade cycle and abolished boom and bust.</p> <p>So he thought the good days would never end, and borrowed and borrowed and borrowed, and racked up the biggest government deficit in the developed world. </p> <p>And he stood aside as our households racked up over a trillion pounds of personal debt. </p> <p>So when the boom did turn to bust and the value of assets fell our financial system was hit harder than most.</p> <p>The Government couldn't complain about financial institutions lending too much money because the Government itself was borrowing too much from them.</p> <p>Added to this was a regulatory mistake that I believe history will judge as one of the most irresponsible.</p> <p>Rather than trying to restrain lending, in 1997 the Government removed the Bank of England's historic ability to ensure that banking credit was kept within responsible limits.</p> <p>The one organisation with the experience, and authority, to call time on debt was taken out of the picture.</p> <p>It is now clear that the resulting, irresponsible borrowing by both private and public sectors was unsustainable.</p> <p>As the head of the Financial Service Authority, Lord Turner, has said, they \"allowed a boom to go on for too long\".</p> <p>So why did our Government let this happen?</p> <p>Was it negligence \u2013 or was it intentional?</p> <p>There is a strong case for saying it was intentional.</p> <p>New Labour took a new approach to economic and social policy.</p> <p>Having previously opposed free market economics, they decided to accept it without question, seeing it as a 'black box' to produce ever-growing tax revenues\u2026</p> <p>\u2026without properly understanding how it worked.</p> <p>The intention was to ride the wave of debt-fuelled growth to fund top-down government programmes in an attempt to \"guarantee fairness\".</p> <p>Of course, these mistakes were not only made in Britain.</p> <p>In other countries, too, excessive debt and irresponsible capitalism have led to serious crises, with implications for the whole world's financial system.</p> <p>The problems are now global and \u2013 as I argued back in March when I discussed the need for changes in the Basel Accords \u2013 some of the solutions will indeed need to be global.</p> <p>We all agree about that. </p> <p>But we mustn't let that consensus hide the truth.</p> <p>The underlying failures of policy were national.</p> <p>The failure to regulate U.S. sub-prime mortgages was an American failure.</p> <p>And the failure to regulate public and private debt in Britain was a British failure.</p> <p>It was a failure Gordon Brown was warned about time and again. </p> <p>And time and again he ignored those warnings. </p> <p>Four years ago he was telling the city: \"I want us to do even more to encourage the risk takers\".</p> <p>Two years ago, he was dismissing calls for what he called a \"regulatory crackdown\" on the City. </p> <p>And only last year, he was celebrating what he called a \"golden age for the City of London\"\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026Now he's describing that very same time an \"Age of Irresponsibility\". </p> <p>\"A Golden Age\" to an \"Age of Irresponsibility\" \u2013 in less than a year. That's what I call a Rock of Stability.</p> <p>Does Gordon Brown really think he's going to get away with that?</p> <p>He cannot hide from his mistakes. </p> <p>He cannot hide from the truth.</p> <p>The truth that over the past ten years, Britain has built up more personal debt than any other major economy in history. </p> <p>The truth that house prices rose higher in the UK than even in the US. </p> <p>The truth that the boom has now turned to bust. </p> <p>And perhaps most damning of all, the truth that while all economies have been hit by this financial crisis, Britain's banking bail-out has had to be the biggest in the world. </p> <p>So let me set out exactly where we've come to. </p> <p>Gordon Brown's policies \u2013 his entire economic strategy - has fundamentally failed. </p> <p>The first result of this failure in domestic policy in the UK was a debt-induced asset bubble in the private sector that has now burst, generating both downturn and serious threats to the stability of our financial system.</p> <p>The second result of this failure in UK policy is that our Government \u2013 having spent all the money in the good years - is less able to help people in this country get through this downturn than the government of almost any other developed country.</p> <p>The Government's deficit is so big that the cupboard is now bare.</p> <p>The third result of this failure of UK policy is that excessive debt-fuelled fiscal expansion, allied to rising raw material prices, has driven the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher \u2013 for longer - than they would otherwise be in order to control inflation.</p> <p>That's put further pressure on families, businesses and our financial institutions.</p> <p>And let's be clear what all this all now means in the real economy.</p> <p>We've got more and more families unable to make the mortgage repayments and losing their homes.</p> <p>We've got more and more good businesses going to the wall because they can't get the credit.</p> <p>And we've got more and more people losing their jobs through no fault of their own.</p> <p>And to this Government and to these Ministers who say that anyone mentioning these things is somehow \"talking Britain down\", everyone knows what you're trying to do \u2013 to close down debate, to shut people's eye, to hide the truth\u2026</p> <p>\u2026to mask your failures.</p> <p>I will never pull my punches in explaining how this Government has brought Britain down.</p> <p>The immediate consequence of all this is, of course, a combination of financial crisis and economic downturn.</p> <p>Before I address the question of how to prevent this from happening again, I want to talk about how we deal with the immediate crisis \u2013 to reduce, so far as possible, the pain suffered by families and businesses over the coming months.</p> <p>And I want to take head-on an idea that has been suggested in some quarters \u2013 the idea that the centre-right's whole economic philosophy is somehow undermined by our support for state action at this juncture.</p> <p>We did support the action taken to re-capitalise banks.</p> <p>Given the irresponsible levels of debt in our economy, it was the only way to minimise the downturn in the real economy \u2013 a downturn costly not only to families and businesses but also to the fiscal accounts.</p> <p>And as I've said two weeks ago, \"there is only one thing worse than state aid for banks, and that is doing nothing\".</p> <p>It was an action that had to be supported by any responsible, centre-right Party.</p> <p>But stabilising the financial system is not by any means enough.</p> <p>In the coming downturn, with unemployment already sharply rising, with real pain for many small businesses, many home-owners, many pensioners and many others besides \u2013 we cannot stand idly by.</p> <p>Some of the strain is being taken by monetary policy \u2013 as the Bank of England responds to circumstances in its decisions on interest rates.</p> <p>Another part of the strain will automatically be taken by the cyclical elements of the fiscal policy.</p> <p>In a downturn, tax revenues will decrease and spending on benefits will increase \u2013 the so-called 'automatic stabilisers'.</p> <p>This will help to counter deflationary pressures.</p> <p>And in the process, it will, of course, add to even further public sector borrowing \u2013 that is the inevitable consequence of economic downturn.</p> <p>But it only re-enforces the point that we have consistently made that it was irresponsible for the Government to borrow so much when the economy was booming.</p> <p>And to those who say we have not been consistent on this, I say go and read our 2005 election manifesto, which we fought on a commitment to cut waste principally to bring down government borrowing.</p> <p>In some countries, like Australia and Sweden, people and businesses can also be helped through significant tax-cuts that are affordable because governments did save for a rainy day.</p> <p>John Howard's responsible fiscal policies now put people in Australia in a very different position from us.</p> <p>But, even if upfront net tax cuts are much more difficult for us than for Australia, we can at least seek to minimise pain on families by preventing those taxes that most affect them from going up.</p> <p>That's why we'll freeze council tax for two years by reducing wasteful spending on advertising and consultancy in central government.</p> <p>There are, however, further, pro-active steps that government itself needs to take \u2013 and which any responsible party of the centre-right can and should support.</p> <p>These are actions to change the law in order to prevent vicious circles of insolvency making the downturn worse than it need otherwise be.</p> <p>That is why we have already proposed to reform insolvency law, to give sound companies breathing space when they face credit problems. </p> <p>And we should immediately suspend the annuities rule, which forces people to buy an annuity at retirement or at age 75. </p> <p>The current volatile markets mean that many pensioners are forced by this rule to lock in lower incomes for the rest of their lives.<br> Over the coming weeks and months we will set out many more ways to help families through the downturn.</p> <p>But short term action to get through the crisis is not enough. </p> <p>We need a long-term plan to rebuild our economy.<br> In a single phrase, we need to change from irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible Government, to responsible free enterprise and responsible Government. Just as I have made the case for social responsibility in our social reforms, our long term plan is based on the principle of economic responsibility. The principles that underpin our social reforms and our economic reforms are the same. That's hardly surprising. </p> <p>After all, to understand how an economy functions, you need to understand far more than the exchange rate and the money supply.<br> The centre right understands that society and the economy are both made up of the same thing: people. You need to get the incentives right, get the framework right, and give people responsibility to do the right thing.</p> <p>You also need people to know that they will be punished if they do the wrong thing.</p> <p>Just as we've argued in welfare, that if you don't accept a good offer of a job you should be denied your benefits\u2026</p> <p>\u2026so too should we say to bankers if you don't succeed, you shouldn't get your bonus.</p> <p>As George Osborne said in his conference speech in Birmingham, it's about demanding responsibility from all of your society \u2013 no matter what your wealth or income. </p> <p>We set out our plan for economic responsibility at conference.<br> It has three central elements. Fiscal responsibility - the Government must live within its means. Financial responsibility - you cannot build an economy on debt. And a balanced economy - as you cannot rely on unsustainable growth in a few areas to increase prosperity for everyone. The free enterprise economy, which has lifted billions out of poverty, is the fairest, strongest and most effective wealth-creator the world has ever known and we would be so much the worse off if we abandoned it. </p> <p>We shouldn't replace the free-market \u2013 we've got to repair it.</p> <p>Repairing our public finances.</p> <p>Repairing our financial services.</p> <p>Repairing our skills, infrastructure, and enterprise culture \u2013 to create a balanced economy.</p> <p>So let me set out exactly what we will do.</p> <p>First, we need to get our public finances back in order \u2013 the traditional role of the centre-right.</p> <p>This means having the character and judgement to impose discipline.</p> <p>That means discipline in opposition.</p> <p>No spending commitments which will never be delivered.</p> <p>No promises of upfront, unfunded tax cuts which will never happen.</p> <p>Instead, responsibly focusing on what can \u2013 and cannot \u2013 be done.</p> <p>And it means discipline in government.</p> <p>Saying 'no' more than 'yes'.</p> <p>Not borrowing to try and buy yourself a by-election.</p> <p>Living within your means.</p> <p>Cutting the costs of social failure, reforming public services and clamping down on public waste.</p> <p>Spending responsibly, borrowing responsibly and saving responsibly\u2026</p> <p>\u2026so in the long-term we can cut taxes responsibly.</p> <p>But to help governments stick to the right course, we need radical a plan for fiscal policy.</p> <p>So we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility \u2013 which will hold every government to account.</p> <p>And to those who say this is just a duplication of what's already there, or just an admission of politicians' inability to take tough decisions, I say: \"wrong on all counts\".</p> <p>It will have far more authority than a select committee or a Westminster think-tank.</p> <p>But, it will not be a substitute for making tough decisions on tax and spending. </p> <p>We will not, as some have wrongly assumed, be subcontracting this core function of government.</p> <p>Quite the reverse: it is because we are so serious about taking those tough decisions on tax and spending that we want to be monitored by an independent authority.</p> <p>They report.</p> <p>Government's decide.</p> <p>So there will be no more fiddling the figures, dodgy statistics, political motivations and machinations to mess around with taxpayers' money \u2013 just good, honest, responsible government.</p> <p>Second, we need strong, responsible and proper regulation of the financial systems that underpin our economy \u2013 another traditional role of the centre-right.</p> <p>I believe in markets that work \u2013 not in the assumption that laissez-faire is enough.</p> <p>As I argued back in March, \"the modern, globalised economy, created to a large extent by laissez-faire economics, demands more than laissez-faire economics for success in the future\u2026.Even a free-marketeer understands that economic liberalism alone is not enough.\"</p> <p>Free markets need rules and frameworks, to make sure they work in the public interest.</p> <p>We regulate utility companies \u2013 and there is a good reason.</p> <p>If they fail, our lights go out \u2013 so we've got to make sure they work.</p> <p>And it's why we need proper, responsible regulation of our banking industry too.</p> <p>Because of the central role that retail banks and building societies play in our economy, they are just like utilities \u2013 if they fail, our economic lights go out.</p> <p>So we need to improve the way our financial system is regulated.<br> For a start, we must ensure that the regulators have the capacity to do the job. </p> <p>For too long, City firms have been able to poach the best regulators. </p> <p>So we will ensure that we get more good staff at the FSA, paid for by an increased levy on the City, and introduce a system similar to the Shareholder Executive so that banks send their best people to the FSA on secondment.<br> But the changes we need to ensure financial responsibility run much deeper.</p> <p>We need radical plan to change our approach to debt.<br> We need to reverse the fundamental mistake made a decade ago that meant that the authorities took no view at all over the level of debt in the economy. That view has been central to the financial irresponsibility that allowed debt and asset prices to get out of control. So we will introduce a new Debt Responsibility Mechanism to ensure that this does not happen again. We will instruct the Bank of England to write regularly to the FSA, setting out its concerns about the sustainability of the level of debt in the economy. </p> <p>The FSA will then be obliged to take that view into account when setting the amount of capital individual banks must hold.<br> So if the level of debt is growing unsustainably, the Bank will instruct the FSA to ensure banks either slow their lending or put aside more capital. The Debt Responsibility Mechanism explicitly rejects the irresponsible attitude of the last ten years that we can just let rip on debt, and not care about the consequences.</p> <p>It will be a fundamental and far-reaching reform of monetary policy.</p> <p>If it had been in place over the last ten years we would not have seen taxpayers forced to recapitalise the banks \u2013 they would never have become so fragile in the first place.</p> <p>But real financial responsibility will not be achieved simply through rules - we need a cultural change on the part of bankers too.</p> <p>No longer must they think just that because they are abiding by all the rules, morality goes out the window. </p> <p>Instead, they must recognise the massive responsibility they have to our society. </p> <p>So just as important as setting the right regulation is introducing the right incentives to create the right culture.</p> <p>The problems we currently face have come about because, for the past decade, the incentives have been distorted. </p> <p>The Executives at the very top of our banks were paid according to the short-term profits they made, rather than the success of any long-term decisions they took. </p> <p>So we've got ask the right questions about whether bankers have too many incentives to increase leverage to increase their returns.</p> <p>Rating agencies were paid only if deals were done, so no wonder they gave out AAA ratings like they were going out of fashion. </p> <p>And banks lending people money for their houses securitised the mortgages in order to get rid of the risk. </p> <p>We could respond in two ways.</p> <p>We could write detailed codes and establish an army of enforcers.</p> <p>Or we could get the incentives right \u2013 to steer people in the right direction and then trust them to make their own decisions and live by the consequences.</p> <p>So we should consider requiring the initiator of a mortgage to retain more of an interest in that mortgage.</p> <p>We should ensure that the regulators take Executive compensation schemes into account when regulating institutional risk.</p> <p>And we should look at the way that rating agencies earn their fees, with more transparency and perhaps some relation to the performance of the securities they rate. </p> <p>All of these measures are about retaining the fundamental strength of the market \u2013 freedom \u2013 but endowing it with the fundamental value \u2013 responsibility \u2013 upon which it depends.</p> <p>Sound public finances by restoring fiscal responsibility.</p> <p>The right framework of rules and incentives in the financial markets so we restore financial responsibility. </p> <p>These are necessary if we are to repair our free-enterprise economy for the long-term.</p> <p>But there is a third requirement.</p> <p>A responsible party has to include rebalancing our economy.</p> <p>Over the past decade, seventy percent of our economic growth has come from just three things.</p> <p>From housing \u2013 which is now declining.</p> <p>From the financial sector \u2013 now in turmoil.</p> <p>And from government spending \u2013 now slowing.</p> <p>And in addition, much of the growth has been driven by immigration \u2013 an unsustainable basis when you consider the impact on public services and our national infrastructure.</p> <p>Unlike many other countries in Europe, we can't turn to a strong manufacturing base to provide export-led growth, because manufacturing has shrunk by more than a million jobs over the past decade.</p> <p>And we can't put our faith in the high-tech service sector \u2013 like in America \u2013 to drive growth, because we haven't created the right conditions for it to flourish sufficiently over the past decade.</p> <p>We've got to change this \u2013 and build an economy that is balanced and resilient. </p> <p>We have to broaden our economic base to include more science, more hi-tech services, more green technologies, more engineering and more high-value manufacturing, drawing upon a much wider range of industries, markets, people, towns and cities.</p> <p>And how will get there?</p> <p>We need a radical plan. </p> <p>We need to do far better in bringing into everyday use technologies that are still in laboratories\u2026</p> <p>\u2026and developing in the laboratory technologies that haven't even been thought of yet.</p> <p>We need to reconfigure our energy systems, wean our economy off its dependence on imported hydrocarbons and turn Britain into a world leader in green innovation and engineering.</p> <p>We need to decentralise our economy so the south doesn't overheat and instead every part of our country plays a significant part in our growth.</p> <p>This won't happen overnight. </p> <p>For a start, this means creating an economic framework that enables new businesses to flourish.</p> <p>That is why we are committed to cutting the headline rate of small business tax to 20p, paid for by abolishing complex reliefs. </p> <p>And that is why we have asked David Arculus, a leading businessman and former head of the Better Regulation Task Force, to head an independent task force examining ways in which a Conservative Government could cut red tape.</p> <p>In the weeks ahead, we must not let this Government make the mistake of thinking that the answer to this crisis is to tax and regulate small businesses even more heavily. </p> <p>But creating a balanced enterprise economy is not simply a matter of government<br>getting out of the way. </p> <p>As I have said many times before, while we must be aware of the limitations of Government, we should never be limited in our aspirations for Government. </p> <p>It is not enough for Government to get out of the way \u2013 they've got to get involved.</p> <p>Government must also do more to secure the skills, energy and transport infrastructure that will help create new jobs in new industries and new markets.</p> <p>That's why we have set out a radical agenda of supply side reform in the education system, to create more and better school places in every community. </p> <p>That's why we are committed to a bold series of environmental policies, from feed-in tariffs for microgeneration to unleashing a green coal revolution.</p> <p>That's why we have proposed a series of policies to make it easier for innovative start-up businesses to win government contracts.</p> <p>And that's why we have pledged to introduce a high speed rail system that will link cities across Britain and transform regional economies. </p> <p>This is the right vision, the right plan, and above all, the right ambition, to create a balanced economy that is built to last. </p> <p>Britain has incredible resources at its disposal.</p> <p>World beating companies.</p> <p>Some of the best, brightest and most creative minds. </p> <p>Universities that are envy of the planet.</p> <p>But as we look at the wreckage of our economy after ten years of irresponsible Government, it's clear that if we're going to make the most of those resources we need change \u2013 not more of the same.</p> <p>Gordon Brown is hoping that his whirlwind of summitry will mean that we will forget what has come before.</p> <p>Forget that he stripped the Bank of England of its powers to supervise the city.</p> <p>Forget he accelerated - how he actively encouraged - the risk taking culture in our banks.</p> <p>Forget that he promised - time and time again - that he had abolished boom and bust.</p> <p>Forget that \u2013 as we enter a downturn, where jobs, home and livelihoods will be lost \u2013 that he was the one who created this mess in the first place. </p> <p>But I won't forget \u2013 and the British people won't forget.</p> <p>A fire has engulfed the house that is our economy.</p> <p>Stopping the fire from spreading \u2013 averting an even deeper financial crisis - has required everyone \u2013 opposition included \u2013 to man the pumps.</p> <p>Now, no doubt, Labour will start to talk about emergency repairs.</p> <p>But this isn't good enough. It's time to construct a house that is genuinely built to last.</p> <p>And we will only build an economy that is strong and there to last if we\u2026</p> <p>\u2026apply the same philosophy as I have been advocating in the social sphere for the last three years\u2026</p> <p>\u2026the philosophy of responsibility.</p> <p>To repair the broken society, in the long-term, we need social responsibility.</p> <p>And to repair the broken economy, in the long-term, we need economic responsibility.</p> <p>That means\u2026</p> <p>\u2026a responsible fiscal policy, bolstered by independent oversight\u2026</p> <p>\u2026a responsible financial policy, bolstered by a renewed role for the Bank of England\u2026</p> <p>\u2026and a responsible attitude to economic development, that fosters more balanced economic growth.</p> <p>And today, it's only the Conservative Party that is offering that change.</p>",
  "<p>Running east out of Flagstaff, Arizona, along old Route 66 (now Interstate 40), the high desert stretches away to the horizon, punctuated only by a mesa here and there, maybe a house sitting in the middle of what looks like nothing. </p> <p>To the north lies the Navajo reservation, the largest parcel of Native American owned land in the country, where Obama has opened campaign offices, paid a visit, and won the endorsement of the tribe, along with many others.
