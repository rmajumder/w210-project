  "<p>Young people, we're often told, don't give a toss about politics. The National Youth Theatre is defying that slur with a season of plays about public issues. After Tory Boyz, James Graham's study of Tory sexuality, we now have a play by Shelley Silas set in the occupied territories and offering a potted guide to Israeli-Palestinian problems. Its final stance may be ambivalent, but it opens up debate and reminds us of the realities on the ground.</p> <p>Silas starts with a meeting on Gaza beach. Rami, a Christian-Palestinian ice-cream seller who scorns direct action, befriends a visiting British-Jewish student, Adrian, who has simply come to see things for himself. But non-combatant neutrality, Silas implies, is not an option in a world of increasing Israeli encroachment. In an attempt at balance, Silas shows a young Israeli soldier, Danny, refusing to serve at a Gaza checkpoint but eventually surrendering to family and military pressure. What triggers the play's crisis is a Palestinian protest against the extension of the Israeli security wall across land belonging to Rami's brother. The question is whether Rami and Adrian will finally come off the political fence.</p> <p>The play gives us a vivid sense of life in the occupied territories. Silas also explores the internal conflicts between militant and moderate Palestinians on the one hand and Israeli peaceniks and traditionalists on the other. But, though she argues that inaction is not an option for beleaguered Palestinians, the dramatic resolution muddies the issue: if Rami is driven to protest, it is less because of a surge of idealism than a belated revelation about his private life.</p> <p>However, this remains an urgent, compelling play that airs a lot of issues. Anna Niland's admirable production, with an ingenious set by Anthony Lamble, shows an ice-cream van turning into an Israeli checkpoint. Oliver Hawes as the ice-cream seller, Ciaran Owens as a fiercely committed protester and Bathsheba Piepe as a grieving mother give strong performances. The play's most heartening feature, though, is its capacity to draw attention to the hideous daily realities of life in the occupied territories, and to keep its young audience spellbound.</p>",

  "<p>As the blood poured from a large gash in his forehead, Iggy Pop roared at the Greek festival audience who had just hit him with a frozen bottle of water during a particularly riotous second encore of the Stooges' show. \"Fuck you! Fuck you, motherfuckers! I am indestructible! I am immortal! You can never destroy me!\"</p> <p>And off he stomped into the next song. The stitches could wait.</p> <p>There's been a hell of a lot that hasn't killed Iggy Pop down the years and, as is traditional, it has only made him stronger. </p> <p>You only have to look at the man. He still appears to have been sculpted from granite, then had his skin shrink-wrapped around him, maintaining the celery-stick physique that seems the exclusive preserve of sexagenarian rock icons and former heroin addicts. Or both, in Iggy's case.</p> <p>\"I do a lot of swimming,\" he explains to the Guide as he sips a glass of red wine in his \"library\". Well, so does David Walliams - will he ever look like this? </p> <p>If any uninitiated pop pickers needed convincing that the reformed Stooges were a subtly different proposition to bands of their generation, proof came when they headlined the Other Stage at Glastonbury last year. Iggy decided he needed a little \"help\", and invited the entire audience onstage with him. This doesn't happen on the Rolling Stones' stadium tours. The ensuing, barely controlled chaos made for one of the all-time great Glastonbury shows, despite the fact that it wasn't the first or last time that the Stooges would pull this stunt. </p> <p>\"We developed the Stooges' music playing at close quarters with people,\" he says, \"so I like to make close contact. But Glastonbury was special. They just kind of advanced like a fog. It was very nice. I found it very relaxing.\"</p> <p>That's not a word many people would use to describe being grappled by hundreds of scrumpy-crazed, mud-caked gibbons, but it's evidently the Stooges' natural habitat. Mind you, such anarchy isn't always permitted in the UK.</p> <p>\"We actually tried it at the V festival,\" Iggy notes, \"but they stopped anyone coming up. I was beating my little fist on the back of this beefy security guy: 'Do it my way!' Heeh heeh heee!\"</p> <p>James Newell Osterberg Jr is a curious mixture of characters: part Beavis-esque mischievous teenager, part wise elder statesman of the arts (\"After I hung out with Nine Inch Nails last night, I was reading a new translation of Herodotus\"), and part snarling old punk.</p> <p>Sure, he's a showman and always was, but you still get the impression that the same mental hinge is loose as when he was smearing himself in peanut butter, slicing himself open with broken glass and inviting crowds full of raging bikers to do their worst.</p> <p>And surely no doctor in the world would advocate a man of his age stage-diving? </p> <p>\"I don't do it often. Although I dove five times at our New York gig - I don't know why - maybe I didn't like the sound or something, or there was a particularly slavering audience. Only once has it turned out really badly. I was on this dumb tour and I was determined to outdo the Bloodhound Gang (puke-drinking frat boy white rappers, FYI). All these little kids were looking at me thinking, 'Who is this weird old man?' So I said to myself, 'I'll fix you, little turds!' and I did a predator drone on them, a surprise dive. They moved out of the way, and I dislocated my shoulder. The arm just hung there for about three months after that. It could have been permanent - but my nerves re-ignited.\"</p> <p>Re-ignited. He always did, as fellow Stooge Ron Asheton can confirm with one of many near-death stories from the latter days of the Stooges' early 70s excess. \"One time I got called to this chick's house,\" he says, \"because he'd ODed on heroin. She put him in a bathtub full of ice, and shot him up with her last gram of cocaine. And she was complaining, too - 'Aw, maaan, that was the last of my stash!' Then he came to, with this stoned, Cheshire cat grin on his face. Other times I've seen him take eight Quaaludes and fall down the stairs. I've thought, 'Well, that's it, then, he's broken his neck, he's probably paralysed.' Then the next thing you know, he's on his feet and off on his merry way. Unbelievable.\"</p> <p>The Stooges of that era eventually split: skint, reviled and, in Iggy and drummer Scott Asheton's case, strung out. And while his singer managed to get clean and launch a solo career, guitarist Ron Asheton eked a living in various bands, playing \"for enough money to feed my cat. I've never had a real job since I was in the Stooges,\" he adds. \"Iggy, on the other hand, used to be a waiter.\"</p> <p>Now, that is one restaurant we'd like to have been a fly in the soup of. But while they were away, the Stooges' reputation as proto-punk pioneers grew, and by the time they reformed in 2003, they were greeted with universal affection and a considerably better class of crowd missile. </p> <p>\"I got a large bra land on my effects pedal at our last show,\" reports Ron Asheton. \"That was nice. But you do still get the odd full bottle of beer; that explodes and it's seriously nasty. And have you ever been hit by an egg? It's like you've been shot!\"</p> <p>Not that his colleague Mr Pop is above provoking a crowd. Thankfully, he hasn't exposed himself recently, which might be a relief to anyone of a nervous disposition who watched C4 pop show The White Room in 1997, wherein Iggy wore a pair of see-through plastic trousers. </p> <p>\"They sold them on Camden High Street, but maybe I was the only person in London who bought a pair! Heeh heeh heee! They looked bitchin'!\"</p> <p>So is the part of his person that Iggy once called his \"nuclear threat\" likely to make another appearance in the near future?</p> <p>\"Oh no, I don't do that now. Maybe to relax once in a while I might, erm, dig my trowel a little bit; I feel it... down there sometimes when I'm on stage, and I do need a little relief. Aren't you going to dig your trowel after you've finished this interview?\"</p> <p>What is this - Gardeners' Question Time? Clearly nothing is taboo for this man. Mind you, he's also not too arrogant to say sorry. As he does when discussing his reference to a \"Paki shop\", made when discussing the aforementioned trousers on TV last year: \"That was really bad. </p> <p>I'd heard the phrase in England in the 1970s, and I had no idea it was anything except an abbreviation. So I definitely apologise for that.\"</p> <p>Just as with all loose cannons, there's always going to be some collateral damage. Yet he's showing no signs of slowing down after his sixth decade on Earth, ripping into 21st-century festival audiences with as much ferocious glee as he once took in winding up Michigan's flower children.</p> <p>\"I've had this tendency all my life,\" he says, \"towards what you might call 'moral retirement' - heh heh - you're presented once you're 16 with, 'Do this', and as soon as you say, 'I'm not going to do this,' it's a form of retirement. And then the flipside is you say, 'I want to do that, even if I'm not supposed to.' I still want to do those things.\"</p> <p>Next on the agenda is another new Stooges album, to follow 2006's rather underrated riff-fest The Weirdness. </p> <p>\"Ron and Scott just sent me the most psychotic, brutal piece of music,\" he purrs. \"I wrote a lyric for it, and it's called God Is Dead. Heeh heeh heee! The other guys got a little worried, they were saying, 'People feel sort of strongly about those things.' But now it's become a cause for me in the band: love Iggy, you gotta love God Is Dead. Heeh Heeh Heee!\"</p> <p>Fair comment. Besides, can you even imagine the worst holy fatwa or vengeance from the Almighty ever stopping him?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Iggy And The Stooges headline Get Loaded In The Park, SW4, Sun 24</p>",
  "<p>There are many amusing moments in this memoir of a clever Malawian's journey from resonant backwaters of the developing world - Zomba, Kasungu, Nkhotakhota - to the over-developed world of conceptual art, as practised in London and other metropolises. The best has to be at the end of a paragraph describing crossing from Malawi into Zimbabwe via Mozambique: \"There was nobody at the Mozambican immigration office except a boy with one leg selling roasted birds and a sweaty, chubby man who walked on to the bus and collected our passports together with a fee . . . When he was finished with them, we headed to Zimbabwe where we were greeted by a black-and-white portrait of Robert Mugabe and a notice that read, 'If you are not happy with us, wait until you get to Heathrow.'\"</p> <p>The poster legend is a typical Mugabe gambit: the wisecrack of the street thug. Kambalu grew up under a more subtly insidious (and far less bloody) dictator, life president of Malawi, Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda. So did I, until I was 14, and it's a pleasure to have one's memory sparked by so much well-observed detail. It is rare to see it, and the reason why is intimately bound with the repressive culture Kambalu describes.</p> <p>Malawi seldom features in books. The material covered in The Jive Talker, which charts the ordinary life of a modern Malawian teenager in country and city from his own perspective, has never before been explored. There was a brief efflorescence of Malawian literature in the 1960s through writers such as David Rubadiri, after which genuine culture was smothered by Banda for most of three decades. </p> <p>The only writer of substance the country has produced is the great Jack Mapanje, but his output was circumscribed by his being imprisoned by Banda for most of the period. Artistic activity was frowned on by the former elder of the Kirk (Banda did his training in Scotland), who only wanted to see graven images of himself, preferably on the printed dresses of the ululating women he liked to have dancing round.</p> <p>Largely because he was courting Britain and (as it often seemed at the time) its proxy, apartheid South Africa, Banda would never have tolerated such bare-faced cheek at the former colonial power as indicated by the Zimbabwean poster. Kambalu sees the consequences of this political and cultural cringe when he gets a scholarship to the prestigious Kamuzu Academy (the so-called Eton of Africa) but he has to fight hard to get there.</p> <p>This is in spite of some advantages. His father is a hospital manager and in some of his posts - the more rural ones, where Kambalu senior, aka the Jive Talker, is in charge - this means the family has plenty of food. The jive he talks is a blend of various philosophers, scientists and classics, as held in a large double-fronted bookshelf christened \"The Diptych\". The scholarship winner and future artist will learn much at this shrine, not least self-confidence, since Nietzsche's collected works bend quite a few shelves of The Diptych.</p> <p>Kambalu needs to be a young Superman, since the path to Parnassus is a thorny one. He struggles with poverty, his father's drinking, and the rejection of a boy whose main interests are fashion and Michael Jackson, in a country where miniskirts and long hair are banned. His flamboyant attitude and quick tongue lead to difficulties with both boys (not wanted) and girls (wanted but unattainable).</p> <p>Malawi is beset by a triadic scourge of evangelical Christianity, the Hitler Youth-like \"young pioneers\" of Banda, and worsening poverty - but all these are as nothing to the scourge of Aids. Misunderstood and misdiagnosed, the pestilence sweeps across the country in the mid-1980s, claiming Kambalu's father, mother and six other family members. The scenes describing the death of his father, the former fount of all knowledge to whom antipathy is later developed, are riven with contradictory passion.</p> <p>This happens while the son is at Kamuzu, learning Latin and imbibing from expatriate teachers a hobbled sort of great education, which his Nietzschean vigour undercuts. It is through Nietzsche that Kambalu develops the art concept of the Holy Ball - an ordinary football, or sometimes a Malawian rag football, stuck over with pages from the Bible - which he associates with sun worship and freedom from oppressive models of thought and being.</p> <p>A sense of cleanly freedom - of \"exercise\" and \"exorcise\" - permeates this enjoyable book. Football playing and fun are presented as the necessary correctives to Banda's Presbyterian gloom and the grimness of disease. The revolving heart of The Jive Talker, the Holy Ball idea will be Kambalu's passport to Amsterdam and then the London art scene, where he continues to kick charmingly about, the living embodiment of good news from Africa.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Giles Foden is working on Turbulence, a novel about the D-Day weather forecast.</p>",
  "<p>Seventy years ago, Europe was plunged into the deepest crisis experienced since the end of the first world war, paving the way for the rapid descent into a new, even more terrible, world conflict. Few historical developments have been more extensively researched and reassessed than the critical events of 1938, and there have been fierce debates, in particular, about Hitler's aims. Did he have a clear ideological programme, a blueprint consistently followed? Or was he a brutal, unprincipled opportunist, with a gift for propaganda and lust for power, together with a sharp eye for exploiting the weakness of the western democracies? Could German aggression be attributed simply to Hitler's megalomania, or did it represent more deep-seated forces in society, particularly the strength of the military and of big business? Did Hitler, in other words, follow or break with traditional aims in German foreign policy?</p> <p>Historians have wrestled with these questions over the years. But they have gradually arrived at some clear answers. We are currently enjoying a rush of major books about the Third Reich by British historians, and these books are noteworthy not least because they reflect the fact that there are now generally - if not universally - accepted conclusions about Hitler and the run-up to war.</p> <p>An obvious starting point in the debate is the publication in 1961 of AJP Taylor's Origins of the Second World War, which set out to be controversial. For Taylor, Hitler was no more than an opportunist, operating without any plan or programme other than vague notions of expansion. Taylor's real villains were the appeasers in Britain and France whose political ineptitude opened the door. It was a maverick interpretation, which was heatedly contested. Hugh Trevor-Roper convincingly argued that Hitler was a man of ideas, however repulsive. Tim Mason, emphasising the economic pressures arising from German expansionism that made a drive to war inevitable, came close to claiming Taylor did not know what he was talking about. In Germany, Taylor's interpretation was scarcely taken seriously, but the antithesis of his approach was at its most forthright in a work that still forms the most fundamental assessment of prewar German foreign policy, Gerhard L Weinberg's masterly The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany, in which Hitler's goal of domination is absolutely central.</p> <p>Recently, Adam Tooze's acclaimed study The Wages of Destruction (Penguin, 2006) has offered a novel approach - looking at Germany's long-term economic weakness in relation to the US as the key to German aggression. As a determinant of prewar foreign policy Tooze perhaps overemphasises Hitler's preoccupation with the threat from America. But he successfully adds increasing economic pressures on the Nazi regime to the ideological thrust that produced those pressures. And he is also one of the few historians to link the radicalisation of antisemitism to the growing proximity of war, as increased international tension underpinned notions of a \"world Jewish conspiracy\" behind US policy.</p> <p>Jonathan Wright has produced the incisive Germany and the Origins of the Second World War (Palgrave, 2007), while German foreign policy is also explored, as part of the structure of the Nazi regime, in Richard J Evans's The Third Reich in Power (Penguin, 2005) and, with particular focus on Hitler's role, in my own biography of the German leader.</p> <p>So what are the generally accepted conclusions? Hitler had no plainly defined programme. But to dismiss him as merely an opportunist would be wrong. He did have a limited but inflexible framework of ideas that gave consistent direction to his leadership. Its twin tracks, embedded in a sense of race as the key determinant in history, were \"removal\" of the Jews and expansion to the east to obtain land to secure Germany's future. Both imprecise, distant goals served, once Hitler had taken power in January 1933, as guidelines for action for every facet of the regime, without ever having to be spelt out in overt policy terms. Much was adapted to rapidly changing circumstances - but within the parameters embodied by Hitler's ideological \"vision\". </p> <p>Before 1938 there was no incompatibility between Hitler's long-term goals and the interests of the military (and other sections of the power elite) in the build-up of German armed force, renewed national strength and standing, and the profits to be made from an expanding armaments industry. But, as would become ever more apparent from 1938 onwards, Hitler was not just following traditional lines of German policy. Taylor's characteristic throwaway line that \"in international affairs there was nothing wrong with Hitler except that he was a German\" (leaving aside the fact that he was actually Austrian) is misleading. Hitler could indeed build on expansionist traditions in the German power elite. But his increasingly unassailable leadership position and his racial obsessions distorted those traditions, then took policy into uncharted territory as the war progressed - producing ultimately the moral and physical ruination of his country.</p> <p>If even in retrospect it hasn't been easy to arrive at a clear assessment of Hitler's aims, it is little wonder that contemporaries inside and outside Germany were unsure how to deal with him. The year 1938 marked the high-tide of the attempts of the western democracies to appease Hitler. \"Munich\" is still a byword for the ignominy that attaches to Chamberlain's attempts to buy off Hitler at the expense of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain's reputation cannot be rescued. But recognition of the grave errors of judgment of policy-making in the 1930s has come to be seen in the perspective of the realistic options open to the British government at the time.</p> <p>The first crisis of 1938, over Austria, arose so suddenly that the Nazi leadership was itself caught unawares. It was triggered by the announcement on March 9 by the Austrian chancellor, Kurt von Schuschnigg, that there would be a plebiscite three days later to determine whether Austria would remain an independent country. The result would have been a foregone conclusion, but the plebiscite never took place. Incensed by Schuschnigg's move, Hitler reacted swiftly. On March 11 the Austrians were bullied into submission, Schuschnigg and the president, Wilhelm Miklas, forced to resign. Lord Halifax, the British foreign secretary, had told Schuschnigg that \"his majesty's government are unable to guarantee protection\".</p> <p>Hitler's axis partner, Italy, offered support for the annexation, prompting effusive expressions of Hitler's gratitude. Hitler's man, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, was installed as the new chancellor. But even with Austria under Nazi control, Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to cross the Austrian border. He himself followed later that day, March 12, making slow progress through the jubilant crowds of Austrians before reaching his home town of Linz. Under the emotional impact of his tumultuous reception, Hitler decided that mere satellite status for Austria was not enough. It had to be full incorporation. Legislation for this was hurriedly devised on March 13. Before the evening was out, Austria was merely a German province. A month later, on April 12, in the perfect result for a plebiscite staged by a dictatorial regime, 99% approved the Anschluss.</p> <p>Though the Anschluss crisis had erupted rapidly and the Nazis had largely made brutal policy on the hoof, it would be mistaken to share Taylor's view that the way in which Austria had fallen under German control had been for Hitler \"a tiresome accident, an interruption of his long-term policy\". It was in fact a direct outcome of the interlinked ideological, military-strategic and economic strands of Nazi policy that had developed over the previous five years. The ideological imperative of expansion, necessitating rapid rearmament, which ensured Hitler's backing in the military leadership and big business, made Austria a strategic target - even apart from Hitler's wish to unite his homeland with the Reich and the growing clamour for union among Austrian Nazi supporters (about a third of the population). The speed of rearmament had led to severe economic bottlenecks. Austria offered much-needed iron-ore deposits, other raw materials and supplies of labour. </p> <p>It was little wonder that there was growing pressure for political union between Germany and Austria, which was already heavily dependent economically on the Reich. In the second half of 1937, Hitler spoke menacingly about moving soon against Austria. And when, on February 12 1938, Hitler met Schuschnigg, he browbeat him into major concessions on German influence there. The plans for a gradual absorption of Austria by Germany were then thrown overboard by Schuschnigg's peremptory announcement of the plebiscite. The crisis followed. But it was a crisis waiting to happen. It was indeed directly provoked by Schuschnigg, rather than Hitler, as Taylor stated, but only in the sense that an unlocked car might provoke someone to steal it. Hitler's furious reaction at Schuschnigg's move should not be taken as evidence that the crisis was unwelcome to the German dictator. On the contrary: it was an opportunity he was avid to grasp with both hands.</p> <p>Hitler knew his action would be swallowed by the western powers. Halifax had implied as much when he had met Hitler the previous November. Chamberlain certainly did not like the brutal methods used. But, speaking to the cabinet's foreign policy committee two days after the Anschluss, he said \"he did not think anything that had happened should cause the government to alter their present policy\" of seeking a general settlement of Europe's problems through the appeasement of Germany. He was, in fact, even more sure that this policy was correct. Appeasement was about to be subjected to a much sterner test in the Czech crisis that was widely expected to follow Hitler's triumph in Austria.</p> <p>The German takeover in Austria left Czechoslovakia completely exposed. And it was even more important than Austria as far as German expansionist aims were concerned. But German aggression was fraught with danger. Since France was treaty-bound to back Czechoslovakia in the event of aggression, and Britain was allied with France, a German attack ran the high risk of European war. The Soviet Union, too, had treaty obligations with the Czechs and had indicated its willingness to help the French. </p> <p>For Hitler, however, there could be no holding back. Precisely because of the alliances between Germany's enemies east and west there was no time to lose in destroying Czechoslovakia if his expansionist intentions were to be realised. Economically, too, the country was a tempting prospect, with its strong industrial base, big armaments factories and important sources of raw materials. The 3 million-strong ethnic German minority in the Sudetenland, abutting Germany, offered the pretext for an allegedly nationalist policy publicly targeted at bringing them \"home to the Reich\". Across the summer of 1938 Hitler ratcheted up pressure on the Czechs. War appeared increasingly likely. But most Germans were horrified at the prospect of another conflict only 20 years after the end of the first world war. Internal reports spoke of a \"war psychosis\" in the German population. The army was divided. The chief of the general staff, Ludwig Beck, advocated a collective stand by the military leadership, but was left isolated and he resigned in August. Whatever their apprehensions, most generals remained loyal. However, for the first time, there were stirrings of resistance among some individuals in high places, and plans began to take shape to have Hitler deposed in the event of a strike against Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>Probably nothing would have materialised. There were inevitable weaknesses in the clandestine planning, the most obvious being a dependence on the willingness of the army's commander-in-chief, Walter von Brauchitsch, a weak reed if ever there was one, to support a coup. But in any case the hopes of the plotters were destroyed by Chamberlain. Wedded to his policy of buying off Hitler, and determined to save Europe's peace, Chamberlain had desperately embarked on shuttle-diplomacy, flying on September 15 to visit Hitler at Berchtesgaden, then a week later at Bad Godesberg. The German dictator simply increased his demands. Even now, Chamberlain was persuaded that Hitler was speaking the truth in wanting no more than \"racial unity\" with the Sudeten Germans. But his personal appeal to Hitler fell on deaf ears. War seemed inevitable. </p> <p>Then the near impossible happened: Hitler backed down. Britain, supported by France, had pressed the Czechs into cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. Mussolini had then intervened, appealing to Hitler for a postponement of troop mobilisation and acceptance of a negotiated settlement along the lines of the British proposal. Being effectively given what he had claimed he wanted, Hitler conceded with bad grace. The result was the infamous carve-up of Czechoslovakia in the Munich agreement on September 30, decided at a four-power conference of the Germans, French, Italians and British. The Czechs themselves were not present at the mutilation of their own country. </p> <p>Hitler had wanted war to destroy Czechoslovakia completely, not a negotiated settlement for a part of the country. His plans went way beyond the \"homecoming\" of the Sudeten Germans. But when Britain and France agreed to give him what he purportedly wanted without war, he had no pretext to fight. \"You can't carry out a world war on account of modalities,\" his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, remarked.</p> <p>Born out of weakness, with resources and military commitments (in different parts of the world) stretched to their utmost, and rearmament programmes (opposed until late in the day by Labour and the Liberals) still in their early stages, Chamberlain's drive for appeasement was a logical outcome of the years of drift, hesitancy and hope for the best in British foreign policy, coupled with the deep fears of a repeat of 1914-18. His military chiefs advised against going to war. The Dominions did not want to fight over Czechoslovakia. Despite their large army, the French, too, had no appetite for a fight: Verdun was too recent a memory. The League of Nations was by this time scarcely even a paper tiger, devoid of credibility since its divisions and pusillanimity had been so clearly laid bare following Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia in the autumn of 1935. </p> <p>And across the Atlantic, the militarily weak US was only just emerging from the comforting illusion of isolationism and starting to show concern about developments in Europe. On hearing that Chamberlain was on his way to Munich, where a sellout to the German bully was the only outcome in sight, Roosevelt cabled \"Good Man!\" to the British prime minister. </p> <p>All in all, Chamberlain was dealt a terribly bad hand, which, however, he then proceeded to play badly through his mistaken assessment of Hitler's aims and his over-eagerness to placate the dictator with territorial concessions. The only hope resided, as Churchill advocated, in creating a \"grand alliance\" with the Soviet Union to deter and put pressure on Hitler. Chamberlain opposed this. Antipathy to communism undoubtedly played its part. But his stated reasoning was that an alliance of Britain, France and the Soviet Union, evoking the alignment before 1914, would ensure that Hitler went to war rather than pull back from conflict. He was probably right that this would have acted as a provocation to Hitler rather than a deterrent. </p> <p>In any case, the \"grand alliance\" had, in practice, little to offer. Though Stalin claimed his troops were ready to march if Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia, the Red Army - devastated by recent purges - would have had its passage through Poland and Romania blocked. In the west, France was looking for a way out of honouring its commitment to Czechoslovakia, and Britain did not want to be tied through its alliance with France to fighting for a people in a \"faraway country\" of whom \"we know nothing\". So Chamberlain, having laid his poor hand of cards on the table at Berchtesgaden and Bad Godesberg, was forced to surrender them - and with them the fate of Czechoslovakia - at Munich. </p> <p>The elation at having preserved \"peace for our time\", which Chamberlain reported to delirious crowds on his return from Munich (he received 40,000 letters of congratulation), evaporated almost instantly. Shame and national humiliation at what had been done in Britain's name replaced it. Yet many who came to heap opprobrium on Chamberlain after the event had earlier supported the policy of appeasement. Tumultuous cheering came from all sides of the House of Commons when Chamberlain announced he was going to Munich. Members of all parties were eager to shake the prime minister's hand, though it was obvious to everyone what the trip to Munich must mean: that peace could only be saved through sacrificing the Czechs.</p> <p>Was Chamberlain merely buying time, as he still claimed in 1940, when he remained adamant he had done the right thing? What would have happened had Britain gone to war over Czechoslovakia in the autumn of 1938? No military aid from Britain or France would have been forthcoming for Czechoslovakia. Probably Hitler's forces would have quickly vanquished the Czechs (as war games predicted). Internal opposition in Germany would have come to nothing. A phoney war somewhat similar to 1938-39 would have set in a year earlier. True, German forces and defences in autumn 1938 were nowhere near as strong as they were by spring 1940. But Britain's forces were at that time proportionally still weaker. Given the pressure to act, the weakness of his adversaries, and his own temperament, Hitler would probably have invaded France in 1939, which would have necessitated some (temporary) deal in the east with the Poles or the Russians. The French may well have caved in as they did in 1940. </p> <p>Whether Churchill would have assumed the premiership in Britain and succeeded in bolstering morale and defiance had war commenced a year earlier cannot, like much else, be known. But without his leadership, Britain might have been tempted to look for a settlement that would have left Germany in the ascendancy in Europe. Who knows? What did not happen is open only to the realms of fantasy, not the methods of historical research. But it is at least feasible that Chamberlain's capitulation at Munich proved ultimately beneficial to Britain - if at the expense of the Czechs and lasting national ignominy.</p> <p>Each of the crises over Austria and Czechoslovakia had a crucial effect on Nazi anti-Jewish policy and paved the way for the third major crisis of 1938: \"Crystal Night\". Though foreign policy and the persecution of the Jews are usually treated separately in the literature - Hermann Graml's Antisemitism in the Third Reich (1992) and Saul Friedl\u00e4nder's Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution (Phoenix, 1997) have to stand proxy for a vast literature on the latter - it is important to recognise the connections. These emerge plainly in the events surrounding the nationwide pogrom of the night of November 9-10 1938.</p> <p>The pogrom was not planned. However, it was also no accidental development. The occasion was the shooting by a young Jew of a German embassy official in Paris, Ernst vom Rath, on November 7, and his death two days later. Goebbels, with Hitler's express approval, seized the opportunity to spur on party radicals throughout Germany to give vent to the \"anger of the people\" and unleashed the orgy of violence that destroyed synagogues and other property, led to the brutal beatings and often death of hundreds of Jews, and ended with 30,000 male Jews being rounded up and sent to concentration camps as blackmail to dredge up the money to pay for their emigration. Hurried legislation was passed to force Jews out of the economy altogether, and to levy a huge, cynical \"fine\" on them - effectively for having provoked the destruction of their own property.</p> <p>Anti-Jewish violence had been escalating for months before the pogrom. Hitler had given the green light to a new wave of attacks on Jews in a tirade at the party rally in September 1937. Soon afterwards the drive to \"Aryanise\" the economy took hold and accelerated throughout 1938 as German big business, keen to maximise profits from the booming armaments industry, eagerly colluded in pressure to force Jewish concerns to sell out for knock-down prices. The economic assault on Jews was accompanied by a raft of discriminatory legislation turning Jews increasingly into pariahs on the fringes of society. And as the year progressed, the violent attacks on Jews, their property, businesses, synagogues and cemeteries drastically intensified. The growing assertiveness of the regime played its part. So did the radicalisation of anti-Jewish policy that followed the Anschluss.</p> <p>The savagery towards Jews on the streets of Vienna immediately following the Anschluss, as the pent-up aggression of Nazi hordes was let loose, surpassed even what had happened in Germany itself since 1933. The uncontrolled violence soon gave way to the more orchestrated violence of organised expulsion in the hands of the man whose ability to force out Austrian Jews established the reputation that would take him to the role of manager of the \"final solution\": Adolf Eichmann. In Germany, attacks on Jews provided a useful distraction for Nazi gangs in a summer of mounting tension. Then the Munich agreement gave a great boost to the regime's self-confidence. By the autumn, the antisemitic climate was extraordinarily menacing for Jews. The powder keg was ready to explode. It needed only a spark. Vom Rath was shot. Crystal Night followed.</p> <p>There was now a stampede to get out of the country, producing a refugee crisis. Around 120,000 escaped over the next few months. But the door to emigration was only partially pushed open. The barriers against acceptance of Jewish refugees, recently reinforced at the international conference at Evian in France in July 1938, prevented many from getting away. Chamberlain agreed to some easing of admission to Britain of Jewish refugees fleeing Germany. But appeasement was only temporarily suspended, not abandoned. He expressed hope that the \"moderates\" in Germany might even now restrain Hitler.</p> <p>In Germany itself, the unpopularity, which went deep into Nazi circles, of the violence of the pogrom (though not of the aim of removing Jews) meant that such an open outrage was not again tried within the Reich. Something even more sinister happened. In January 1939, responsibility for finding a solution to the \"Jewish Question\" (still through forced emigration) was handed over to the security police - clearing a path that would end in the gas chambers. There was no thought of gas chambers at the end of 1938. But in the fetid anti-Jewish atmosphere before and after the pogrom, notions that war would bring a showdown with the Jews - seen as responsible for Germany's defeat in the first world war and now viewed as pernicious agents in agitating for a new war - were voiced by leading Nazis. These marks of a genocidal mentality found their most outright expression in Hitler's baleful \"prophecy\" made in his big speech to the Reichstag on January 30 1939 that \"if the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevising of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe\".</p> <p>At the end of 1938, then, the twin Nazi aims - expansion to gain domination in Europe, and \"removal\" of the Jews - had blended into the vision of a war soon to be fought and the destruction of the Jews as an outcome of that war. The appeasers, by means of their sellout of Czechoslovakia at Munich, had bought a respite. They had not, even now, given up. Only when, in March 1939, Hitler tore up the Munich agreement and occupied what was left of the Czech lands did the scales finally fall from their eyes. Another crisis, now over Poland, was inevitable, with Britain and France finally committed to action in the event of German aggression. Hitler thought the western democracies would give in over Danzig as they had done over the Sudetenland. This time he was wrong. This time there was war.</p> <p>Looking back at 1938, we see \"old Europe\" approaching its end, before war enveloped it and before the entry on to the scene of the superpowers that would determine the ruined continent's postwar destiny. It is not a pretty sight - a Europe of bitterly competing nations, riven by the age-old clashes for dominance, now taking place in an era of hyper-nationalism with its attendant imperialist ambitions, buttressed by the technologies of total war and mass death. </p> <p>Seventy years on, our present Europe, for all its flaws and faultlines, provides such an attractive contrast that it is hard not to see the European project that arose from the lessons of the second world war and out of the far-sightedness of, especially, postwar German and French statesmen as a huge success story. The main objective of these postwar visionaries was to prevent circumstances ever again arising in which European nations could go to war with each other. The former Yugoslavia gives an example of what, not long ago, was still possible outside the framework of what became the European Union. Though \"1938\" will not be repeated, the crisis spots have moved elsewhere. The dangers to world peace are different, but still present. Having come this far, logic suggests that we need to look to a future in which, without any loss of national identity, a European voice can speak more strongly and urgently for the interests of a united continent than can the current prevailing and persistent dissonance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ian Kershaw's Hitler is published by Allen Lane.</p>",
  "<p>The chief executive of TNK-BP, Robert Dudley, has complained to Russian authorities about the Moscow labour inspectorate's treatment of the company. In a letter this week to six government organisations, Dudley said the inspectorate's actions could be seen as an abuse of its powers.</p> <p>Last week a Moscow court banned Dudley from working in Russia for two years, linked to breaches of labour laws. Dudley left the country last month, saying he hoped his move would ease the administrative burden on the company.</p> <p>In the letter Dudley said that, since April, the inspectorate had made seven inspections - two scheduled and five unscheduled - to examine the company's compliance with the labour code. \"The fact this number of verification measures has been taken in relation to one company, when there is a developing corporate conflict between the Russian and foreign shareholders of the TNK-BP group ... over a short period of time, provides a basis for concluding that there has been an abuse of power by the state labour inspectorate as well as a possible interest on its part in the outcome of the inspections,\" he said.</p> <p>The letter was addressed to the Federal Service for Employment and Labour Relations and copies sent to other organisations, including the anti-corruption council, the general prosecutor's office and the federal security service.</p> <p>BP, which owns 50% of the company, and four Russian billionaires who own the other 50%, have been at loggerheads for months over its direction and strategy. BP has backed Dudley while the Russian shareholders have sought his removal.</p> <p>In his letter, Dudley criticised officials, insisting he, not the company, was the target. Among his complaints is that the inspectorate refused to postpone a meeting with him scheduled at the same time he was meeting officials from another government organisation in an unsuccessful attempt to extend his visa. </p> <p>He also claims the company was allowed insufficient time to prepare for meetings and to respond to inspection results.</p> <p>The letter asserted, \"all their actions were purposefully focused on imposing [the] administrative liability of RW Dudley alone ... The unambiguous conclusion is that the said officials were carrying out somebody's orders and we request that this be investigated.\"</p> <p>The inspectorate rejected Dudley's claims. \"All the checks that took place at the firm were done by the law,\" said the head of the organisation, Mikhail Malyuga.</p> <p>BP gets a quarter of its oil and gas production from the joint venture but only 10% of its profits. Publicity surrounding the power struggle between BP and Russian shareholders has thrown the spotlight on the country's corporate governance. </p> <p>It has also prompted speculation that the repeated inspections and ban on Dudley could mean a state-controlled entity is interested in TNK-BP as Russia seeks to tighten its grip on its energy sector.</p>",
  "<p>The comedian Peter Kay is to return to British television for the first time in four years with a three-hour parody of reality TV. </p> <p>In Channel 4's Britain's Got the Pop Factor and Possibly a New Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar on Ice, the Phoenix Nights star will play an aspiring reality TV contestant. </p> <p>Launching its autumn schedule, the broadcaster also announced a year-long season of programmes, The State of the Nation, that will \"examine how vital UK institutions are coping with the demands and pressures of the new century\", including documentaries on the NHS, immigration, the police and the benefits system. </p> <p>Julian Bellamy, head of programming at Channel 4, said the season would kick off with The Family, a five-part observational documentary. </p> <p>The actor Samantha Morton will make her directorial debut with The Unloved, a feature-length drama drawing on her experience of growing up in care. Boys and Girls Alone will take 10 boys and 10 girls aged eight to 11 and put them in separate villages without adults to see how they fare. </p> <p>The idea was criticised by the Tory MP David Davis, who said: \"There's a danger this could leave children traumatised.\" But Channel 4's head of factual entertainment, Andrew Mackenzie, said that the children were monitored at all times and all the parents felt it was \"an incredibly positive experience\".</p>",
  "<p>Bedlam is a social history of madness in England that loosely follows the 750-plus years of the Bethlem hospital. It depicts the dramatic shifts and reversals in the treatment of mentally ill people from the middle ages to the present, and also charts changing popular attitudes toward this often demonised and much abused minority of the population. </p> <p>Catharine Arnold has not restricted herself to a narrow view of her subject. She has roved widely, and peppers her narrative with startling anecdotes and brief sketches of such characters as Henry Maudsley, \"the gloomy genius of late Victorian psychiatry\". Maudsley, who gave his name to the famous clinic across the road from King's College hospital in Camberwell, was a proponent of the view that insanity was hereditary, that it spelled the extinction of humanity, and that in the twilight of empire England had become the asylum of the world. </p> <p>Elsewhere we read of that desperate evening in September 1796 when Mary Lamb \"turned upon her mother with wild shrieks and stabbed her through the heart, before hurling the knives and forks around the room, one of which struck her helpless old father on the forehead\". Lamb was not hanged and she did not end up in Bethlem. Her brother Charles had her confined in a private madhouse in Islington, where she made a full recovery. Later, like him, she became a distinguished essayist. But despite his sister's return to sanity Charles took no chances. After Mary's release, \"the Lambs never left home without a straitjacket\". </p> <p>In a period when the psychiatric treatment of women in particular was often barbaric, Lamb's experience in the Islington asylum offers a rare instance of compassionate care. Others were less fortunate. Until the reforms of William Hood, who became medical superintendent of Bethlem in 1853, inmates were confined in conditions of filth and squalor, unsegregated by sex, chained to walls naked and freezing, physically abused by their attendants, and displayed to a jeering public like animals. A former patient, Urbane Metcalf, in the catalogue of horrors he produced on his release, mentions the case of a man called Popplestone, \"whose leg rotted off as he was chained up for such a lengthy period that the metal cut into his flesh\". There was also the infamous case of the American marine James Norris, so closely confined in chains, and for so long, that eventually his intestines burst.</p> <p>Arnold occasionally makes wild claims. Discussing the great earthquake that terrified Londoners in 1750, and \"brought out the incipient maniac in everybody\", she writes: \"Towards the end of the 18th century, the majority of press and parliament appeared clinically insane...\" And a little later: \"An extraordinary number of leading politicians were mad, by any standards, and a similar instability characterised the leading intellectuals of the day.\" </p> <p>It's debatable whether the gentle, Keatsian melancholy she celebrates in the last pages of the book belongs in the same order of disease as, say, the psychotic illness of the artist Richard Dadd. He murdered his father in Cobham Park because he believed he was the devil. He escaped to the continent, intent on killing the emperor of Austria. Captured and locked up, in Bethlem and in Broadmoor, where he died in 1886, he sustained to the end his belief that he was possessed by evil spirits. </p> <p>Or consider Charles Burton, who was admitted to Bethlem for killing his sister, with whom he had an incestuous relationship. Later he amputated his penis, \"that it might not again get him with disgrace\". The sufferings of Blake, Swift, Pitt the Elder and Dr Johnson pale by comparison.</p> <p>A distinguished French scholar attributed the problem of madness in England to \"the mixture of fogs, beef and beer aggravated by the rigours of nonconformity and the tedium of the English Sunday\". Amusing asides like this cohabit uneasily with serious accounts of therapeutic and legal developments in the treatment of mentally ill people. This juxtaposition can make the book read more like a miscellany than a focused history with a thesis to argue. This is both the strength and weakness of Bedlam. It permits the author to indulge all that is quirky and macabre in the fascinating story of madness in England, but at the same time curtails exploration of topics that cry out for more detailed treatment. </p> <p>Bethlem was founded in 1247 as a sanctuary, and became an asylum for the insane in the 1370s. It moved from Bishopsgate to Moorfields in 1676, and to Lambeth in 1815, where it remained until 1930. That building now houses the Imperial War Museum, and Bethlem is currently located in \"the sunlit uplands of suburban Kent\", in a country estate called Eden Park. To deal with any thoroughness with the history of this institution and a host of related topics requires a volume many times the size of this one. But Bedlam does provide an account of how painfully slow progress in the field of mental health tends to be, and how that progress has often been checked by fear and incomprehension, and even turned backwards in periods of therapeutic pessimism and institutional neglect. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Patrick McGrath's most recent novel is Trauma</p>",
  "<p>This column doesn't often get round to looking at food books but, every now and then, into my ken swims one that tweaks my curiosity. In the case of Black Pudding &amp; Foie Gras, perhaps it was the title. It has a certain resonance, and suggests an individual approach to the business of cooking. It may have been the size, which is considerable, or the cover, which is suede-ish, or the photography, by Antonio Olmos and Sam Bailey, which is generous, stylish and evocative. But it was the name, Andrew Pern, chef/proprietor of the Star Inn at Harome in Yorkshire, that most made me sit up and take notice.</p> <p>I can still remember a pudding of baked ginger parkin with rhubarb ripple ice-cream and hot, spiced treacle I ate in the Star many summers ago. It managed to be warm and cool and spicy and soothing and sophisticated and stonking and of its place all at the same time. I was reminded of all these qualities as I leafed through the book (and indeed found the recipe for the above pudding) because Andrew Pern is nothing if not a champion of food from his region. For him, it isn't a matter of any old asparagus, but Sand Hutton asparagus; not a plain Gloucester Old Spot suckling pig, but Charles Ashbridge's Gloucester Old Spot suckling pig with Ampleforth apples for good measure. Then there's Hartlepool-landed halibut with steamed marsh samphire, Whitby crab and lemon verbena hollandaise, and North Sea brown shrimp fritters. </p> <p>\"I was born in Whitby, I grew up round here and I'm a proud Yorkshireman,\" Andrew says. \"When we came here I knew we could draw on really great raw materials. It's like having a brilliant pantry on our doorstep. And it's common sense to use it.\"</p> <p>The recipes in the book don't celebrate provenance and producer in name only: there are pictures and profiles of them, too. There's Paul Talling, who supplies the Star's poultry, Richard and Ronda Morritt, the growers behind Sand Hutton asparagus (not to mention Sand Hutton strawberries), and Father Rainer Verbourg of Ampleforth College, once a chef, now a monk in charge of the college's orchard. There's Jo Campbell from Mount St John, who supplies fruit and veg, and Alan Hodgson of Hodgson of Hartlepool, responsible for the halibut and the Star's other fish. The whole book is a hymn to local produce and local producers, and a testament to the vision and energy of Andrew and Jacquie Pern.</p> <p>\"I was inspired by the likes of Paul Heathcote at Longridge and Nigel Haworth at Northcote Manor,\" says Andrew. \"They were the first chefs in the north really to make a point about using local ingredients.\"</p> <p>Black Pudding &amp; Foie Gras is unconstrained by the narrow imagination of the commissioning editor. Pern is his own publisher and, alongside recipes that provide a record of the dishes served at the Star, the book is part autobiography, part statement of Pern's personal credo, part summary of the 12 years he and Jacquie have spent building up the inn and its surrounding businesses. For the Perns are to Harome what Rick Stein is to Padstow. As well as the inn, there's the herb garden, corner shop, loft, Pern's of Helmsley butcher's and deli, accommodation and cooking courses. No wonder the area's known as Pernshire. And that's before we get to the four Pern children.</p> <p>\"Jacquie and I love the way of life, and the children are very much a part of the place. They've grown up with it, and there'll be plenty for them to do when they're ready.\"</p> <p>So there will. The Perns are in the middle of a project to extend the covers to 60, which means a new kitchen, complete with chef's table. \"Well,\" says Jacquie, \"you've got to keep life interesting, haven't you?\"</p> <h2>Where to get it</h2> <p><strong>Star Inn</strong> High Street, Harome, Yorkshire, 01439 770397, <a href=\"http://thestaratharome.co.uk\">thestaratharome.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Black Pudding &amp; Foie Gras</strong> by Andrew Pern is available from the Star Inn at \u00a336 plus p&amp;p</p>",
  "<p>If you were the boss of a paparazzi agency, a scene like this would probably figure on your fantasy wishlist. If you were a satirist, you probably couldn't make it up. What the farmer and his family must make of it, I would not dare to even guess.</p> <p>Meadow Cottage farm in Hampshire is a chocolate-box idyll, set in fields populated by Jersey dairy cattle. The photographer is setting up lights in the cowshed when we arrive, while his two young assistants - who appear to have landed from planet Hoxton, all asymmetric hair and pixie boots - are busy with laptops in the creamery. The hut where ice-cream is normally sold has been commandeered by the hair and make-up artist, who perches Kate Garraway on top of a milk churn, beneath a poster advertising cockerels, and consults a copy of i-D magazine for \"edgy\" ideas. While he applies emerald glitter, the PR man circles the farmyard on his mobile phone in search of a signal.</p> <p>The farmer calmly fetches bales of straw in a wheelbarrow, while his daughter and her two little girls offer everyone their homemade ice-cream. </p> <p>When Garraway's transformation from studio anchor to milkmaid starlet is complete, there are extensive consultations with the photographer about the \"look\" of the shoot. It must be \"provocative\" and \"arresting\", but not \"offensive\" or \"salacious\"; the sensitivities of GMTV viewers are nervously invoked. The PR and Garraway consider her wardrobe options: casual jeans, or sequined ballgown? They're thinking something maternal, but glamorous, only not too Cadbury's Flake commercial - or, Garraway laughs, \"too League Of Gentlemen\".</p> <p>What none of us has factored into all our calculations, however, is the recalcitrant will of a four-week-old bull. Garraway positions herself in a nest of bales in the cowshed, but the calf has other ideas. A tug-of-war breaks out. The farmer straddles the back end while Garraway wrestles its head into a bucket of milk. The girls giggle; the calf thrashes his head; the make-up artist darts into the commotion to touch up Garraway's fringe. \"Oh God,\" she groans in despair, laughing. \"Maybe we should just have used a stuffed toy.\"</p> <p>And then, amazingly, the calf seems to change his mind. Slowly, gradually, he nuzzles into her lap, and remains there, docile and content. All of us - the farmer, his daughter, the little girls, the assistants, the PR, the make-up man - hold our breath while the photographer shoots. </p> <p>Garraway belongs to a small group of television presenters whose popular appeal - and fascination - would not necessarily be inferred from the nature of her day job. A former newsreader, she has been a regular presenter of GMTV since 2000, where her interviewees range from the prime minister to whoever happens to be the latest human interest story. The week before we meet, she interviewed the dog playing Toto in The Wizard Of Oz and commanding the Royal Festival Hall's loudest curtain call. The raciest moment of Garraway's irreproachably genteel career was probably her confession in May that she'd been lying about her age - by all of one year - and was turning 41, not 40.</p> <p>When she took part in Strictly Come Dancing last year, her comically clumsy performances ought to have seen her voted off first. But week after week she watched more gifted dancers voted out, by an audience that seemed enchanted by her dogged haplessness. The tabloids were sensationalised, and on Radio 4 television executives debated her perverse popularity. Did it \"personify the spirit of Strictly\", or discredit the show? A Sunday newspaper's false allegation earlier this year of an affair with her dance partner, Anton du Beke, resulted in more headlines and a six-figure libel settlement. </p> <p>A magnet for celebrity magazines, Garraway's 2005 wedding to Derek Draper, the former Labour spin doctor turned psychotherapist, was covered by OK!. The arrival of their daughter, Darcey, two years ago provided another OK! photo spread. Even a dispute with their local planning department over a loft extension made headlines. For a while, it was rumoured the pair were to become the new co-hosts of ITV's flagship political programme. Instead, Draper has returned to the Labour party in a part-time campaigns post, while Garraway continues her reign of the television schedules. She has just made a Channel 4 documentary called Other People's Breast Milk - which is why, she explains, she is now in a cowshed, pretending to nurse a small calf, hoping to make the point that it is as odd for a human baby to drink cow's milk, as a calf to drink human milk.</p> <p>Other People's Breast Milk takes Garraway to America, to meet women who breastfeed babies who do not belong to them. She meets a working mother who employs someone to feed her baby while she is at work, and groups of other women who breastfeed each other's for free. </p> <p>\"I'd gone into the film thinking, 'Why are they doing it? Is it because it's easier than breastfeeding themselves?' They threw it back and said, 'No, we're not doing it for convenience, we're doing it totally in the interests of the child, and we're prepared to sacrifice our ego of having that role.' \"</p> <p>Garraway had always known, she says, about the nutritional superiority of breast milk. \"From the second you're pregnant, they tell you that breast milk can do anything from cure conjunctivitis to send your child to university. If it could put the kettle on, it would make you a cup of tea, kind of thing. So I knew that.\" But her reasons for breastfeeding her own daughter had been purely psychological. </p> <p>\"I went back to work, albeit part-time, relatively early at three months, and I just felt it was really important to me, when I came in the door and Derek's mum had been looking after Darcey all morning, emotionally I could push her to one side - mum's here now - and it was something only I could do. That bond was really emotionally important to me, and so I would never have been able to let someone else breastfeed her in a million years.\"</p> <p>When she explained this to the women in the documentary, however, they told her it was the most selfish thing they'd heard. \"They said, 'What you're entirely thinking about is your role as a mother, and your mental state, you're not thinking about the child at all.' These were clever, interesting women - and they said, 'That's all about you, not the child.' I'd never thought about it like that before.\"</p> <p>The documentary is part of a Channel 4 strand that pairs presenters with subjects - another in the series takes Women's Institute members on a tour of foreign brothels - and it's easy to see why the producers chose Garraway for Other People's Breast Milk, for she has never, she agrees, been \"the earth mother type\". Yet her conversion is practically evangelical.</p> <p>\"To be honest,\" she says, \"I felt a bit like a milch cow when I was breastfeeding, a bit unfeminine, particularly when you've got a pump. It's a bit unsexy, and you feel disempowered, and that's been the view of breastfeeding for a while - you're chained to this baby and it's not the modern, feminist woman. But I came away from this documentary feeling the opposite, just in wonderment at the female body. Just how clever the breast is. If I was breastfeeding a baby right now, and you sneezed, within hours my body would have produced antibodies that through the milk would protect my baby from those germs. It's just an incredible thing that we take for granted. But because of the sexualisation of breasts, we don't see them as the clever, brilliant things they are. Not in the way that we see the brain or the heart.\" </p> <p>If she had another baby and couldn't breastfeed, she still couldn't see herself letting anyone else - but she would buy human milk from a milk bank.</p> <p>\"Before, I wouldn't have, because I'd have found it a bit icky. But I think now that's crackers, because why are we happy about giving it something from a cow's breast, which is another species? The women kept asking me, 'Why are you happy to give your baby milk from another species' - which is what formula is - 'but you're not prepared to give it from another woman?' And I said, 'I don't know. You're absolutely right. I've never thought about it. I'm bonkers.' \" </p> <p>As Garraway talks, I wonder about the secret of her popularity. For a veteran presenter, she is extraordinarily guileless. Her version of worldliness and glamour seems to lack even a hint of professional cynicism, which makes her an unusually endearing celebrity. But to infer naivety would be misleading, for when I ask whose idea it was to pose as if breastfeeding a calf, she says, \"Mine. I wanted to make people stop and think about whether it's crazy to feed milk from another species. I want to go as far as possible to be provocative and shake people up, without actually being so offensive that I upset GMTV viewers. It's quite,\" she breaks off laughing, \"a fine line.\"</p> <p>To spend a day with Garraway is to glimpse the micromanagement of the fine line that her particular brand of fame, straddling journalism and celebrity, demands. On the way to Hampshire, she discusses the competing career merits of different reality TV shows, much as an academic would compare university postings. \"The thing about Strictly is, the worst you could say about me was that I'm a rubbish dancer. You haven't discovered any of my politics.\" She wouldn't \"go into the jungle\", she reflects - \"and if you'd been on Love Island in a bikini, I don't think people could take you seriously interviewing Gordon Brown.\" She laughs, adding: \"They might not after my calf shoot, actually! We'll have to wait and see.\" Does that worry her? \"Oh yeah, totally. You have to be really aware of that. You have to stay as neutral and credible as possible.\" Why do a shoot like this today then? \"Because you're saying, 'Yes, this shocking, but it's got your attention and now I want you to think about this project I've been working on, because I think it's fascinating and you might just do, too.' \"</p> <p>During the furore of Strictly last year, some of her rival dancers complained darkly that they were competing against a \"PR machine\". Did Garraway think it was fair? \"Well,\" she says carefully, \"it depends what you think of as PR. But what PR is, I suppose, is trying to show yourself in the best light, and everyone on the show was trying to do that.\"</p> <p>She is certainly married to one of the most formidable spin doctors of our time. Draper learned his craft as the apprentice of Peter Mandelson, but after leaving politics under a cloud, accused of offering access to ministers, he renounced public life for a new incarnation as a psychotherapist. The couple met when he had just returned to Britain from training in California, and was in the habit of referring to himself as \"the new Draper\". But he has since developed quite a profile as a media shrink, and returned to politics - so I wonder if it's been strange for her to witness the at least partial reincarnation of \"the old Draper\"? </p> <p>\"To be honest,\" she smiles, \"I think he's always been that. When I met him, I don't think I ever believed in this idea that he was no longer a political animal. I think he was very conscious of not being sucked back into his old life, but it was obviously all still in him. And I do completely admire that - even though,\" she adds quickly, \"I don't necessarily share all his party politics.\"</p> <p>She is wary about even discussing his new role within Labour, mindful of compromising her neutrality. \"Weirdly, actually, we talk about politics so much less now. Politics at home has completely dried up. I said to him, 'You can't tell me anything, because everyone will assume I know everything so it's best I know nothing.' And he's got his outlet now. Whereas he used to rail at the television screen and bulletins about things he disagreed with, now he just quietly makes a little note.\"</p> <p>From the outside, the pairing can easily look like a match of Draper's Machiavellian mind with Garraway's artless appeal. It would not be entirely inaccurate: he professed himself dumbfounded that she took criticism of her dancing on Strictly so personally, when all he could see was the wonders it did for her profile. But interestingly, when the apology for libel was delivered in court earlier this year, it was Draper who broke down in tears. Had it been left to Garraway, you get the impression she might not even have bothered to sue. \"I'm very practical about the press,\" she says frankly. \"The only reason to employ a presenter is because they hope it will increase the chances of people watching the show - that's my job. So I never object to being followed, even though I know there are privacy laws that say you shouldn't be. I kind of think, you know what, that is the name of the game. You're on television, you're asking people to watch your shows, and get involved in your life. I totally understand that that means you're a commodity for photographers and newspapers and things.\"</p> <p>On the way back to London, her phone rings. From the sound of her voice, so easy and friendly, it could be one of her friends - but when she hangs up she looks perturbed. It was a tabloid, asking if rumours they'd heard of a new pregnancy were true. If only, she smiles. And so a day that began at 3am in the studio ends in consultation with the PR man, who heads off to make some calls.</p> <p>Not once, all day, is Garraway ever less than charming. She never even seems to have to try. I'm left torn between admiration for the pragmatism, which can accommodate such phone calls, and semi-nude photoshoots with calves - and bewilderment at its cost. Where does the line between acceptable self-commodification and loss of privacy lie? </p> <p>\"Well,\" she reasons equably, \"I just think your job as a presenter is to form a relationship with the viewer. And when that relationship's formed, you've got to expect that they're going to want something back as well.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Other People's Breast Milk will be shown at 10pm on September 9 on Channel 4.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday August 23 2008.

  "<p>Even before its release in the US the other week there was a stampede to denounce Ben Stiller's $90m action-comedy Tropic Thunder, a brutal satire of Hollywood egomania, star-fits, venal agents and producers and, um, Apocalypse Now.</p> <p>And no wonder. It's hard to know which aggrieved group is the most upset. First, there's the overweight, who were up in arms about the movie's references to a fictional, Eddie Murphy's Klumps-style \"Fatties\" comedy-flick franchise, while the organisers of the paralympics, no less, called for a boycott of the movie, on the grounds of its frequent use of the word \"retard\". </p> <p>But, surprisingly the group complaining the least - well, so far - is the one the American media apparently wishes would march on cinemas with torches and pitchforks: African-Americans. Because the touchiest aspect of the movie's 360-degree willingness to offend is its decision to paint Robert Downey Jr in blackface makeup. Downey plays a self-important, humourless Australian method actor named Kirk Lazarus who immerses himself so thoroughly in his role as a gung-ho black sergeant that he undergoes what the script calls a \"controversial procedure\" involving pigmentation alteration, puts on an Afro wig and undergoes \"Ebonics vocal training\" to become more convincing in his movie-within-the-movie role.</p> <p>It's a good thing they cast someone as intelligent and instinctively brilliant as Downey, though the actor was rightly nervous about grasping the nettle of American racism so tightly. As he told Entertainment Weekly, he even felt there was a chance his reputation might be \"destroyed\". \"That was my fear,\" he revealed.</p> <p>Downey's role is hedged in all around with caveats that make it abundantly clear that the joke is on Kirk Lazarus alone. First up, there's a real African-American character, named Alpa Chino and played by Brandon T Jackson, who's ready to call Lazarus on his method bullshit. Offscreen, Jackson also nixed the script's lone use of the N-word, a change Downey thoroughly endorsed.</p> <p>Now, just because it's loud and clear that the joke is all on Kirk Lazarus and not on African-Americans, this is still incredibly edgy material in a country whose history of slavery and racism still reverberates to the present day. After all, it's only four and a half decades since America's blacks were guaranteed the right to vote.</p> <p>We may have a black man running for the presidency, but we also have a broad resurgence of racially-based humour in stand-up comedy - one thinks of the tightrope delicately (and not so delicately) trodden by such comics as Sarah Silverman, Jim Norton and Nick DiPaolo - and across the media, while right-wing radio hosts make more of perceived \"black racism\" and \"special pleading\" than they do of naked or coded white bigotry. McCain's team accusing Obama of \"playing the race card from the bottom of the deck\" - that indelible phrase, uttered by a white man to describe the OJ Simpson defence team's strategy - is a classic recent use of dog-whistle racism. We shall discover on election day just how racially divided America remains, and many are not optimistic about what November 4 may tell us.</p> <p>That's the increasingly toxic racial atmosphere into which Tropic Thunder was released. But equally important is the centuries-old genre of \"blackface\" or \"minstrelsy\" from which the Kirk Lazarus conceit ultimately derives. Blackface is as old as, and perhaps even older than, Othello, but its American version, poisoned by the nightmarish experience of slavery, began even before the civil war, as a weird conduit through which aspects of the African-American experience were transmitted to a white audience. The semi-official Southern anthem Dixie came from the blackface tradition (original phonetic lyrics: \"I wish I was in de land ob cotton/ Old times dar am not forgotten/ Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land\"), and the pervasive Jim Crow laws enacted during the post-civil war reconstruction era were named for an 1828 minstrel song called Jump Jim Crow by white minstrel TD \"Daddy\" Rice. It was all self-evidently racist - but such ugliness will always have unintended consequences.</p> <p>Minstrelsy - which at first involved whites blacking themselves up with burnt cork and performing pseudo-black acts - was surpisingly enduring, its popularity lasting from about 1830 to around 1930. Somewhere in this period blacks themselves got into the act, to the extent that they too had to wear blackface, cartoonish Afro wigs and obscenely overdone red-and-white mouth make-up, a tradition carried on by black comics like \"Pigmeat\" Markham deep into the latter half of the 20th century. Black people dressing up as racist stereotypes of themselves? There's a reason Greil Marcus called this period \"The Old, Weird America\".</p> <p>The black version of blackface was inevitably more \"authentic\", the music was probably a lot better, and even the great black reformer Frederick Douglass felt moved in 1849 to say of the phenomenon, \"It is something to be gained when the coloured man in any form can appear before a white audience\" (which only proves how awful things were). In the 20th century, radio comedy The Amos'n'Andy Show, starring white comedians performing a sort of \"aural blackface\", was one of the most popular and (in formal terms) most influential and innovative programmes of the 1930s, with its short-lived TV spin-off still being syndicated in 1966.</p> <p>Nick Tosches has also made bold claims for blackface in his book Where Dead Voices Gather, a profile of Emmett Miller, an obscure (white) blackface performer whose (largely non-racist) songs have been covered by Hank Williams, Merle Haggard and - ye gods! - David Lee Roth. The absorption of black styles into white music started a long time before rock'n'roll blew up, and much of it happened as an unexpected by-product of minstrelsy.</p> <p>The list of famous artists who have performed in blackface at one time or another is simply staggering: Fred Astaire, Shirley Temple, Judy Garland, Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Milton Berle, Joan Crawford, Doris Day, Bing Crosby, both Frank Sinatra and Dino in the original Ocean's 11, and more recently, Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places, C Thomas Howell in Soul Man, and Ed Harris in Masked And Anonymous. Let's not forget, either, that the BBC's Black And White Minstrel Show ran until 1978.</p> <p>By the 1960s, minstrelsy and blackface inevitably attracted black satirists. Comedian Godfrey Cambridge made Watermelon Man, playing a suburban white bigot who wakes up black one morning. But bear in mind the studio originally wanted the role played - in blackface, natch - by Alan Arkin or Jack Lemmon. In 1970. Since then we have seen multiple Eddie Murphys in \"whiteface\", as well as Dave Chappelle, and the Wayans brothers in White Chicks. But perhaps the most blistering take on the phenomenon was Spike Lee's scathing satire Bamboozled, in which a horribly racist blackface TV pitch, designed to get its creator fired, becomes a massive hit in white America. It ends with a montage of grotesque, depressing racist imagery from American movies and TV shows, many still very familiar to us.</p> <p>Barack Obama may be running as a \"post-racial\" candidate, but America is not yet a post-racial society (something it has in common with many others, let it be stressed). And however much America deludes itself that it has transcended race, the old deformities, absurdities and animosities still linger in new forms: idiot fratboys blacking up for Halloween parties; the suburban wigga; the modern right's cynical co-opting of the politics of historical grievance for its own ends (\"He called me whitey! Wah!\"). In comedy, race is the final frontier, and sharper comedians will always be tempted to lambast the mentality of denial that's discernible in a neutered public culture of white liberal guilt, as Stiller and Downey do in Tropic Thunder. Those with poor judgment can sail off the edge of the world: just ask Seinfeld's Michael Richards. </p> <p>No matter how much things improve, race always finds new ways to make us crazy. One line from Tropic Thunder sums up the whole demented parallel-universe of blackface: \"I know who I am!\" says Lazarus. \"I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude!\" </p> <p>He has no idea.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tropic Thunder is released on Sep 19</p> <h2>Comedy's last taboo... </h2> <p>It's been 30 years since The Black And White Minstrel Show last entertained primetime viewers, but examples of blacking up have been creeping back on to our screens over the last few years. <strong>Richard Vine</strong> takes the role call...</p> <p><strong>Little Britain </strong></p> <p>Matt Lucas and David Walliams extended their repertoire of female grotesques with mail-order Thai bride Ting Tong and the introduction of ex-Miss Botswana and former international showjumper Desiree DeVere, love rival of the portly Bubbles.</p> <p><strong>League Of Gentlemen </strong></p> <p>\"Wanna buy some pegs, Dave?\" Even in a town crammed full of local eccentrics, evil minstrel \"wife-collector\" Papa Lazarou stood out as one of the freakiest residents.</p> <p><strong>Bo!

  "<p>At my Catholic primary school in the 1950s we occasionally had visits from missionaries, such as the White Fathers and the Medical Missionaries of Mary, engaged in bringing the word of Jesus to the pagans of Africa. We collected money to help them with their good works and we followed their progress in missionary magazines. </p> <p>In this account of his career in the medical aid agency M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, its former president James Orbinski records his attendance at mass at the cathedral built by the White Fathers in Rwanda (where 60% of the population is Catholic). Though the Christian missionary tradition is now much disparaged for its complicity with colonialism, its paternalism and its racial condescension, when I look at the \"new humanitarianism\" of the radical NGOs such as MSF that have largely replaced the old religious orders, I am struck by the similarities as well as by the differences.</p> <p>One similarity is that just as most missionaries who came to our school were Irish, so representatives of aid NGOs often seem to speak with an Irish accent. In the new world order, an informal division of labour appears to have been established between major military powers (the US, UK, France) and those that present the developed world's humanitarian face (Canada, Australia, Sweden, Belgium). Ireland is in the privileged position of being part of modern Europe but also the historic victim of Britain. As the Irish patrons of the new humanitarianism, Bono and Geldof confirm, today's Irish NGO leaders can also draw on the nation's rich reserves of sanctimoniousness. Orbinski tells us that he was born of Irish parents in Coventry and brought up in Canada.</p> <p>The typical NGO activist he describes - chain-smoking, hard-drinking, swearing - certainly presents a different image from the austere and pious missionaries of old. Yet whereas the nuns and brothers were modestly supported in local communities with funds raised penny-by-penny through church networks, the new NGO staff are largely financed by western powers, to the extent that they are able to play a major role in \"failed states\" such as Somalia, Sudan and Afghanistan, providing health and other services for large populations of displaced or impoverished peoples. The fact that since the end of the cold war western military intervention overseas - in the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East, Africa - has increasingly been justified in humanitarian terms, means that aid NGOs get more and more state funding. In turn, this has meant aid NGOs are increasingly perceived as mere agents of government policy. But this also means that humanitarianism has become degraded.</p> <p>Today MSF is a multinational corporation, operating in 70 countries, with a budget of $350m and a staff of thousands. As MSF president, Orbinski was in regular contact with senior figures in the UN and the EU, with heads of state, government ministers, military chiefs, drawing on his experience of negotiating with local powerbrokers in conflict situations from Peru to Tibet.</p> <p>Feeding the hungry and treating the sick are noble tasks, and Orbinski records the courageous work of MSF volunteers in grim and dangerous conditions. In 1999, partly in recognition of its role in focusing world attention on the \"genocide\" in Rwanda, MSF was awarded the Nobel peace prize. As its president, Orbinski received the award.</p> <p>In Rwanda, where he was MSF section head for two months in 1994, the new humanitarianism received its harshest test. Orbinski provides a harrowing personal account, as a doctor working in a hospital in the capital, Kigali, of the mass slaughter of around 800,000 Tutsis by Hutu militias. For MSF, it was not enough to provide humanitarian aid, it was necessary to speak out against these atrocities and to call for UN military intervention to stop them (MSF was founded in 1971 on the basis of its rejection of the traditional Red Cross position of silence). </p> <p>While Orbinski insists that MSF adheres to the principles of impartiality and independence, his account indicates that he came to confer his approval on the Tutsi forces (\"disciplined, bold and unwavering\"), led by Paul Kagame, which entered Rwanda from Uganda (with US support) and established a new government in July 1994. He is consistently disparaging of the Hutu militias, together with the former Rwanda government and its French backers (represented in Rwanda by the renegade MSF founder turned French politician, Bernard Kouchner, with whom Orbinski had a stand-up row).</p> <p>The dangers of taking sides, at least on the basis of the hastily assumed posture of condemnation adopted by MSF and other NGOs, became apparent once the new government had taken power. In April 1995, Kagame's Tutsi forces massacred 4,000 Hutus in a refugee camp at Kibeho, an incident witnessed by a number of NGOs, including MSF. Orbinski's comment that \"the Kagame regime continued to be anything but Boy Scouts\" indicates MSF's ambivalent response (if Kagame's forces were \"disciplined\", this suggests that the government's responsibility was even greater). </p> <p>The demonisation of the Hutus had even more serious consequences as the focus of the conflict shifted to the refugee camps across the border in Zaire. Here MSF withdrew its humanitarian services from refugees because of the presence in the camps of former members of the Hutu militias. There followed a series of attacks on refugee camps, notably at Mugunga in November 1996: Orbinski acknowledges about 400,000 to 500,000 refugees \"disappeared\". Though MSF protested against these massacres, its previously simplistic presentation of the conflict in terms of good (Tutsi) and evil (Hutu) meant that it had unwittingly drifted into collusion with the very actions it condemned.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the continuing wars in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo), the death toll is estimated at 5.4 million, the highest since the second world war. MSF and gap-year humanitarianism are in no way to blame for this carnage, but neither are they entitled to accolades for bringing peace and progress to Africa. The aid NGOs are no more saintly in that respect than those missionaries of old.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael Fitzpatrick is a GP and author of The Tyranny of Health: Doctors and the Regulation of Lifestyle (Routledge).</p>",
  "<p>Wilco van Rooijen takes the bandages off his feet and shows me his frostbitten toes. They are hideous - black slugs with squashed bloody bits in the middle like mangled pizza. There are still five toes on each foot, but probably not for much longer. \"Those two will go,\" he says, pointing to the toes next to the big one on either foot. \"And probably a bit of the big toes. That's what worries me. The big one is for balance. I'd have to learn to walk again.\" It would also, presumably, mean the end of his career as a mountaineer.</p> <p>I ask him how he feels. \"Really good,\" he says. \"I have no fever, and I also have no nightmares. So actually, I'm doing fine.\" He knows how lucky he's been. </p> <p>Van Rooijen led one of the teams tackling K2 which was caught in the biggest climbing catastrophe of recent times. Eleven died - some slipped to their deaths, most were struck by huge blocks of ice. Van Rooijen's team got off lightly - of the five who set out one turned back; one, the Irishman Gerard McDonnell, died; and three survived. McDonnell's boots were seen flying through the air in the snow and ice. His body was not found.</p> <p>Van Rooijen, 40, was stuck for three days at the top of K2. The world's second highest peak, bordering Pakistan and China, is known as the Savage mountain - only 305 people have reached the top and at least 76 people have died attempting to negotiate it, most on their way down. By rights, Van Rooijen should be dead. The cold should have seen him off, or the lack of oxygen, and it was a miracle he didn't slip.</p> <p>We meet at his tiny house in Utrecht, in the Netherlands. His 10-month-old son, Teun, is playing with Van Rooijen's wheelchair, and his teacher wife, Halaan, is tending the invalid's needs with a great deal of love and a fair bit of exasperation. What did she think when she first saw his feet? \"Awful. Really awful. Painful and smells, everything. But he's still alive, and that's the main thing.\"</p> <p>Van Rooijen looks tanned and healthy and is remarkably upbeat. He tells the story as if it's an old tale he's been banging out for years. It's only after a couple of hours you notice that he's going over and over the same ground, trying to make sense of it all.</p> <p>As a child he loved walking in the Alps with his parents. When he was 16 he started climbing, and wanted to know everything there was to know about ropes and knots. He did a degree in electronics and prepared to follow his father into engineering, but he knew it wasn't for him. Instead, he worked with friends fixing houses to subsidise the climbing trips. Eventually he stopped working as an electrician, devoted himself to climbing and supported himself by travelling the country giving companies motivational speeches. </p> <p>He told them how he had tackled the north pole, the south pole and Everest. And most of all, he told them about the first time he attempted K2 in 1995. They always preferred the disaster stories. That time, a boulder smashed his face and his arm. \"I hardly survived. A big stone smashed my face and my arm. People see me with a bloody face and they are shocked. They think this is not just a walk in the mountains, this guy is crazy. Then I start to explain that if you are ambitious there is a lot of risk.\" </p> <p>Another trip to K2 was inevitable. \"I had this drive to prove to all the people around me that I could do K2, that I can climb Everest without oxygen, that I can go to the north pole, that I can survive for 80 days on the south pole.\" He clicks his fingers as he counts off each challenge. \"A lot of people didn't believe me. Maybe because of this I had this stubborn thing; I will show you.\" </p> <p>The first time he attempted K2 he had just got together with Halaan. How did she feel about it? \"You can ask him the questions. I'm not commenting.\" Which seems to be an answer in itself.</p> <p>\"She thought it sounded exotic back then,\" he says, \"but she didn't know anything about peaks. It sounded romantic, and there was media attention. But then when it went wrong she was very scared and said, 'I hope you never do this again'.\"</p> <p>He went back in 2006 with McDonnell. That time the Irishman was hit on the head and broke his skull. </p> <p>What is the thrill in climbing? \"It's a milestone. You can say your whole life, 'I was there'. When you talk about it, you get this, I don't know how you say it in English, this shivering.\" He points to the hairs on his arms. \"If you are there. Pfffff.\" He blows on his teeth in awe. \"And you are fighting for each other, taking care of each other - to survive this it gives you a soulmate. The rest of your life you can always knock on the door. They will always be there to help you.\"</p> <p>I tell him it seems like a death wish. Ach, he says, that's the anti-climbing lobby for you. All you hear about are the dangers. \"It's always in the media when people are killed. But if it's a successful story, nobody's interested. To the summit this time, it was all perfect, and then all the way down, it's this big story because of the tragedy.\"</p> <p>I find myself laughing. Come off it Wilco, I say, you can hardly expect news stories saying, \"Climbers have lovely time at summit. PS 11 killed\".</p> <p>He smiles, and concedes it's unlikely. Yes, he says, the risk is part of the attraction. \"People do think we are crazy, but we also think a lot of people around us are spilling their lives by doing nothing. My mother, my father, they died from cancer. My mother was eaten away by this disease, and for her the quantity of life was the most important thing. She was 63 when she died. For me, it's about quality. Maybe you don't get old, but it doesn't matter to me.\"</p> <p>When he left for K2 in May Teun was only seven months old. Did that make the decision tougher? \"Yes, of course. But you just have to put things in compartments and concentrate on the job in hand.\"</p> <p>It was on the way up that he witnessed his first death on the mountain. A Serb climber detached himself from the rope to pass another climber and fell. \"You think, fuck it is not possible, because it is getting very stupid.\" He clicks his fingers again. \"And gone. \"First he slips, then he tumbles over then he's gone. It's some kind of slow motion. You think, give me your hands, then he's gone. Aaaah! Just like that. Then you realise, fuck he must be dead. Then you see some movements on the glacier and everybody is shouting he's still alive.\" But he wasn't. Minutes later the Serb's high-altitude porter also fell.</p> <p>Van Rooijen's team reached the summit. Two of his partners descended that night to the lower altitude of camp 4. But by the time Van Rooijen was ready to go, the avalanche had cut the ropes and they could not go. It was late, the temperature was falling, and he was trapped in the \"death zone\" above 8,000 metres (26,000ft) with four other climbers, including McDonnell.</p> <p>Next day, the clouds had descended on the mountain, making it almost impossible for the climbers to see each other. Somehow Van Rooijen managed to descend the perilous \"bottleneck\" where so many of the others met their deaths when hit by the ice. But by now he was snow-blind, delirious and frozen. He lost his way. He had his satellite phone, but couldn't read the numbers of his team-mates. He hallucinated - hearing voices and seeing imaginary people who didn't rescue him. Then he came across three real people and wished it was another hallucination - three Koreans, tangled in their ropes, hanging upside down, dying. Only one could talk and he asked for clothes to keep warm.</p> <p>Amazingly, Van Rooijen survived another night. Did he give up hope? \"I thought, nobody knows I'm here, it's bad weather, no helicopter can get here. Probably I gave up. I thought if I moved, I'd fall. There was no solution.\"</p> <p>Van Rooijen is a Christian, but he says he didn't pray or think about his family. \"It was just pure focus. I was only thinking about surviving. I was too busy to pray. If I had prayed then it would have meant I'd really given up.\"</p> <p>Next day he was even weaker. He fell asleep for a couple of hours. \"I'm not sure if it was tiredness or that I lost consciousness.\" When he woke up, the clouds parted, and he spotted a gully. Through that he managed to make an escape, and unwittingly headed for his camp. His team spotted him. Despite the frostbite he managed to get back to base camp, where the helicopter picked him up.</p> <p>What amazes me is how calm he is less than three weeks later. It seems as if the frostbite is emotional as well as physical. Perhaps the enormity of it will suddenly hit you, I suggest. \"No, I don't think so, because as a mountaineer you know these things can happen.\" He says that if and when his feet recover he will climb more 8,000-metre mountains, and that even though it is awful that so many people died this expedition will be good for business - this disaster will easily out-disaster his previous visit to K2 and all the businessmen will love to hear about it. </p> <p>What about his ambitions for the future? For once, Halaan answers. \"To build a farm. We have just bought a farm.\"</p> <p>He hobbles over to his computer on his heels to show me his pictures. </p> <p>What was it like when you reached the summit? \"It was the most beautiful thing. At the top you're looking over maybe 100 mountains. The earth is not horizontal any more, it makes a curve. You see this beautiful round planet earth. Gerard had tears in his eyes.\"</p> <p>He shows me the pictures and they are the most stunning scenes imaginable - climbers at the top of the world, heads in the perfect blue sky. And he talks about all the people up there that they befriended: the Norwegian newlyweds - the wife saw her husband fall to his death; the experienced French climber set on returning to France until Van Rooijen convinced him to stay because good weather was forecast and it would be his chance to complete K2 - he and his high-altitude porter died. </p> <p>He shows me the picture of McDonnell, grinning, waving his Irish flag. And them all hugging in joy. \"You see Gerard, standing there, this huge man with a big smile on his face. There was not a moment when we were thinking of tragedy. Everything was according to plan.\" </p> <p>He clicks on to pictures showing a trail of blood, then two sherpas horribly contorted in their ropes. \"One of the sherpas had reached the summit, and the next day his wife gave birth.

  "<p>The Spanish pilots' union sent a series of letters and emails to Spanair's senior management warning of safety worries more than a year before Wednesday's crash at Madrid airport claimed 153 lives, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>In one letter the union, Sepla, wrote to Lars Nygaard, then Spanair director, and Marcus Hedblom, present managing director, warning: \"The operative chaos is putting passengers at risk.\"</p> <p>The letter, dated April 2007, said: \"It's our obligation to inform you of the elevated unease which exists between ourselves for the daily running [of the company] for the past month.\" It alluded to a lack of resources, a scarcity of ground crew and a number of planes which had been declared unfit to fly.</p> <p>In another letter, pilots complained \"unfortunately all this indicates this will end in chaos\", and in a further letter the union warned: \"The norms about operating punctuality, desired by all, stop in many cases the realisation of norms of airline security.\"</p> <p>Spanair did not respond to attempts by the Guardian to verify the claims.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a video of the crash yesterday suggested it was not caused by either of the plane's engines bursting into flames, as had first been thought.</p> <p>The video shows Spanair flight JK 5022 take off and struggle to gain altitude, never rising higher than 50 metres, before it crashes to the ground. The plane then skids along the runway, breaks apart and bursts into flames.</p> <p>The security video, taken by AENA, which runs Spain's airports, appears to contradict suggestions that an explosion or fire in one of the engines could have led to the crash at Barajas airport.</p> <p>Manuel Bautista, director general of AENA, said the plane had suffered more than one fault. \"The motor is not the cause of the accident,\" he said.</p> <p>One of the investigators, Emilio Valerio, told the Cadena Ser radio station the video would be used to establish the cause of the tragedy.</p> <p>A recently married couple who met in London were among those who lost their lives in the crash. Brazilian Ronaldo Gomes Silva, 25, and his Spanish wife, Yanina Celis Dibowsky, 21, met when they were living in London and married last month in Brazil. </p> <p>The couple were making a visit to the Canary Islands to stay with her family before returning to London to begin their married life.</p> <p>The groom's father, Juli\u00e3o Alves da Silva, told Brazilian television: \"I am destroyed. I have lost my son and a daughter-in-law.\"</p> <p>Silva is thought to have arrived in London in 2004, and worked as a motorcycle courier. Dibowsky worked there as an ice-cream seller.</p> <p>Silva's brother Rodinaldo, 27, who also lives in London, has flown to Madrid to arrange for his body to be returned to Brazil.</p> <p>Also killed was Siomara Hern\u00e1ndez, 19, who was 12 weeks pregnant, along with her baby son Tanausu and 15-year-old sister Abenauara. They were flying back to the Canary Islands to celebrate news of her pregnancy with family.</p> <p>A funeral will be held for the victims of the crash in Madrid's Almudena Cathedral on September 1. And with at least 20 of the victims coming from the Canary Islands, authorities on the islands were planning a large funeral there in the coming days.</p>",
  "<p>From the roof terrace of our hotel we can see a handful of determined souls on their hands and knees, digging and brushing the soil of Trapezitsa Hill, foraging for ancient relics in the midday sun. Mad dogs and Bulgarian archaeologists, it seems. We nip down to our room for a siesta on crisp cotton. But we're not so different, us and the soil raiders. Whether you are unearthing 5,000-year-old burial sites or unlikely boutique beds, Veliko Turnovo is quite the discovery.</p> <p>The first backpackers arrived here by default. As a stop on the Bucharest-Istanbul rail route, and being midway between Sofia and the Black Sea coast, it's the kind of place that backpacker flexi-time naturally leads you to. Sprinkled over the basin and hills of a dramatic meander of the Yantra river, Veliko Turnovo is home to Bulgaria's most prestigious university, with more than 10,000 students, and the bars and clubs that keep them entertained. </p> <p>So how come you've never heard of it? Perhaps you've been distracted. Over the past few years Bulgaria has become a byword for cheap package holidays to the Black Sea coast and credit crunch-friendly ski breaks to Bansko. Veliko Turnovo is one of the country's best-kept secrets. </p> <p>Keen students of Balkan nationalism will know that it was here that Bulgaria's first constitution was written, and later where the country declared its independence in 1908. </p> <p>But Veliko Turnovo isn't a place to exercise your brain. It's a place to stare at from as many angles as possible. Our first view, however, is a disappointing one: the bus station is in the new part of town, a botched communist-era job of too much concrete and too many rectangles. We flee, and within 10 minutes we are at the opposite end of the visual spectrum. The Hotel Studio is probably the most stylish hotel in Bulgaria. The sleek reception and chic minimalist rooms wouldn't look out of place in any west European capital. <strong> </strong>Neither would the design flourishes - dim neon perspex lamps and a plush red armchair by the bed, backing on to a wall pasted in black floral motifs - or the restaurant serving fusion cuisine and fine wines. The \u00a360-a-night tag certainly would. </p> <p>Up on the roof, we've got the best seat in the house. The bulk of the town is scattered across a hill wedged between two river gorges. We can see the entire western face of the fortifications, bound by a ring of walls and medieval ramparts. In the centre the fortified shaft of the Patriarch's Tower is the king of the castle. North of the fortress is Execution Rock, from where traitors and invading rotters were nudged into the river.</p> <p>Across the gorge, the archaeologists are digging away at Veliko Turnovo's second hill, where recent excavations have unearthed the burial sites of some of Bulgaria's first kings. The surrounding slopes are coated in forest but where they even out, on hilltops and by the river's wide banks, hundreds of red pantile roofs cap the wood-and-stone houses, which look like a cross between Adriatic villas and Alpine chalets. Behind us, the stark green neo-Byzantine domes of the Sveta Bogoroditsa church bubble from its sandy yellow walls. </p> <p>We plod through the centre of town into the historic Samovodska Charshiya quarter. On a cobbled street dozens of artisans are peddling their goods. Jewellers chisel and hammer behind wooden workstations, and artists take a break from painting gilt icons on to dark slabs of wood to walk us around their shops. In an antique shop the size of a cupboard a large babushka sits wedged behind a tiny desk, surrounded by a clutter of communist relics, dusty maps and metal figurines. </p> <p>A few minutes north and we're in the Varosha district, the oldest residential part of town at the top of the hill, and it feels as if we've wandered into a forgotten rural village. Kittens are splayed out on the cobbles, grannies are nattering in the shade. The Hiker's Hostel was the first hostel to set up here six years ago, and now hosts a steady stream of backpackers. We're looking for Hristo Panov, the hyperactive 27-year-old manager famed for his daytrips.</p> <p>\"Take your pick!\" he enthuses, before recommending the swimming trip. We are driven half an hour out of town through beautiful parched countryside, down a couple of dirt tracks and via a peculiar little monastery with an ornate rood screen and a painting of Jesus, in which his eyes seem to close as you approach. Weird. When we get to our destination, it becomes obvious why it is Hristo's favourite. </p> <p>A tributary of the Yantra runs through a succession of natural rock pools in the middle of a forest. Hristo eats two ice creams and smokes half a pack of cigarettes before falling asleep for two hours as we jump into the water from rocky ledges and sunbathe. On the way back we stop off at lookout points where paragliders wait for gusts, and in the tiny village of Arbanasi we visit the sublime Church of the Nativity (Rozhdestvo Hristovo), every inch of which is coated in richly coloured frescoes. Hristo charges us \u00a36 each for the day. </p> <p>A number of restaurants along Stefan Stambolov, Veliko Turnovo's main street, have no back walls, offering superb views across the gorge. The locals have an odd habit of naming their ventures in the fashion of Newquay clubs - we see a Scream, a Scandal, a Tequila, a Deep Cafe. And they seem to have an obsession with salad. At Ego, which offers the best view of all the restaurants and bars, there are 64 to choose from. There are also 31 grilled options, two dozen stews and a dish called \"chicken and vegetable mess\". But the bigger-the-menu-the-worse-the-food rule doesn't seem to apply here. The Bulgaria-is-ridiculously-cheap rule does, and we stuff ourselves for under \u00a35 a head with wine.</p> <p>We're here in the middle of the week and out of term time, so Veliko Turnovo's nightlife - reputedly Bulgaria's best - is relatively subdued. But we give it a go. It turns out that the medieval capital of the Bulgarian tsars has a penchant for gangster rap and techno. It may have the stunning views, a boutique hotel, and more day trips and salads than you could possibly need, but there's never an excuse for double-speed 50 Cent.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.Easyjet.com\">Easyjet.com</a> flies to Sofia. <a href=\"http://www.Flythomascook.com\">Flythomascook.com </a> flies to Varna.

  "<p>It was a blind date in the most unpropitious of circumstances. There we stood in the car park of a business zone off Helsinki's ring road, and there stood Elvis, gleaming white, the size of a small lorry. He was to be our sitting room, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom for the next two weeks; he was to be our only shelter from the intermittent chill and downpours of a Finnish summer. </p> <p>For the children, it was love at first sight; it was to be a wonderful holiday romance. A campervan full of extraordinary gadgets - seats that turned into beds, ladders that opened up more beds, loos that swivelled, windows that popped wide open. It was a combination of a playhouse and a climbing frame and, best of all, it was on wheels. We hadn't got beyond the suburbs of Helsinki before it was christened Elvis, on account of his big quiff (otherwise known as the bed section that sits over the driver and front seat). He had the big personality too - his white plastic bulk glinting through the thickest of empty Finnish forests. \"We're all shook up, huh, huh,\" the kids chorused as we rattled north. It was like travelling in a cutlery drawer: everything stayed in its compartment, but only just.</p> <p>Elvis filled me with anxiety. He was clearly going to be high maintenance - which of those gadgets would restless six-year-old fingers break first? - but back in London, in January, a campervan had seemed a good solution to those wearying efforts to plan a family holiday. We had never been to Finland, so we knew nothing about the place other than a few tips we had got from a friend. Did we want to go to Lapland? Did we want to visit the remote islands of the southwest? Did we want to visit the lake district and Karelia along the Russian border? How on earth are you supposed to make up your mind six months in advance? We thought longingly of those pre-children holidays when you made it up as you went along. That's when we hit on the campervan idea; perhaps this was the way to have the spontaneity without the hassle of trying to find hotel vacancies for a family of five (the children 13, 11 and six) at short notice. </p> <p>The road north from Helsinki was gloriously empty. Conifer forests stretched in every direction for as far as we could see. We had a map, a guidebook and the address of a friend. Our spirits soared, released from the crowds, queues and traffic jams of southern England.</p> <p>Like all holiday romances, the initial thrill subsided quickly - after three hours, to be precise. Finland is not a country for thrilling road journeys, we realised, as we travelled mile after mile past trees and more trees. So we swiftly abandoned any ambitious plans for long-distance treks to the Arctic Circle. Plus, having controversially left the Nintendos behind, the noise levels in the back of Elvis were rising. The children needed to burn off some energy.</p> <p>Finns are rightly proud of the \"every man's right\", which allows you to camp and build a small fire anywhere as long as you keep out of sight of people's homes. So we drove Elvis into the heart of the lake district and parked him in a small clearing in the forest for five days. Twenty feet away through birch woods carpeted with bilberry bushes was Saimaa, Finland's biggest lake. Its shoreline is one of the longest in the world; there are 50,000km of reed inlets, rocky islands and coves in the Mikkeli district alone.</p> <p>This is one of Finland's favourite playgrounds. It is wild but not remote (we were only 9km from the nearest town, Puumala), every corner marked with a discreet wooden cottage, a jetty and the obligatory sauna. The vastness of the forest and lake means that it never feels crowded, but you are never entirely alone. Long into the evening, we could hear the occasional splash and murmur of conversation from across the water as someone emerged from their sauna to plunge into the glassy stillness of the lake.</p> <p>The days fell into an easy pattern. With so much shoreline to explore, boats are essential. We tried a bit of everything: we rowed, we hired a small outboard motor and we ended up in canoes. We paddled across open water, through thick reeds and water lilies, and even across water forested with pretty pink flowers. We picnicked on islands of huge grey boulders, then dozed lying on the springy lichens and mosses that covered rocks warmed by the blazing sun.</p> <p>All of this was the prelude to the main event of the day. At 4pm we began chopping the wood and stoking the sauna stove, and by five we had begun the sequence of sweating in 100F heat and then cooling off in the icy lake. Several hours later, pink- cheeked and bright-eyed, the children were wolfing down supper grilled on the bonfire and tucking into mounds of tiny wild strawberries and bilberries, which we had collected from the forest.</p> <p>Emboldened by the children's enthusiasm for canoeing, we took up the offer of the local blacksmith, Martti Malinen, to arrange an overnight canoe trip. He ferried us in his boat to his family's cabin on an island 10km across Saimaa, towing our canoes, and then left us to make our own way back. </p> <p>We took it slowly, hopping from island to island, with a break every hour or so for snacks and bilberry picking. By late afternoon, we had struck camp by the shore and got a fire burning, so we spent the evening trying our hand at fishing. The next day, the weather changed and the effortless paddling of the previous day became a battle into a headwind and driving rain. My canoe spun round like a child's top as I struggled to steer, but that only heightened the sense of achievement when we arrived back at Martti's, where he and his wife warmed us up with cups of tea and freshly baked bilberry pie and offered their sauna to dry us out.</p> <p>The lakes exerted a hypnotic charm, and we struggled to pull ourselves away. But there was plenty more of Finland to explore so we clambered regretfully back into Elvis and moved on. I had a curious obsession with getting to the Russian border so we headed east, swinging by the magnificent castle of Olavinlinna in Savonlinna and then following a tiny back road to the border, one of the most sensitive of the cold war. The fields were thick with ripening crops and the roadside brilliant with purplish vetch and willowherb. Eventually we reached an empty pillbox, a copse of CCTV cameras and a stop sign ahead of the border zone; the children were intrigued at the idea of a border that moves - Finland is still aggrieved at losing a large chunk of Karelia at the end of the second world war.</p> <p>We moved on to Porvoo on the coast just east of Helsinki, where the Russian tsars used to take their summer holidays, an easy boat trip from St Petersburg across the Gulf of Finland; now it's a stop off point for the cruise ships doing the same voyage. Gift shops and cafes have sprung up to service the tourists, but the cobbled streets and wooden painted houses are charming and, after the wildness of Saimaa, buying postcards and sipping good coffee was a welcome novelty.</p> <p>From Porvoo we decided to squeeze in a last-minute dash across southern Finland to the archipelago of islands south of the country's oldest city, Turku. We rolled on and off the free ferries that link the islands, and reached Nauvo, a sleepy place of red ochre-painted barns, apple trees laden with fruit and brilliant blue inlets of sea. We hired bikes and bowled along through the forest to a jetty where we plunged into the sea to cool down.</p> <p>Heading back to Helsinki in Elvis, humming nostalgically to the eighties hits favoured by one Finnish radio station, I appraised my brood. They were going to cut quite a sight at Heathrow. Their clothes were stained with bilberry juice and frayed by the scrambles over boulders; they were a bit weary after the long light evenings when no one wants to sleep; they looked a little grubby despite the hours in the saunas; and there was a scattering of mosquito bites. But they were as brown as berries and glowing with the exhilaration and new confidence of children who had spent a fortnight out in the vast spaces of light and water of an extraordinary place.</p> <p>Our holiday romance was over. We had grown fond enough of Elvis for warm farewells but we were relieved to separate on good terms without having inflicted any lasting damage.</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting there</strong><br>Blue1 (<a href=\"http://www.blue1.com\">blue1.com</a>) flies Heathrow-Helsinki.

  "<p>There was one conspicuous absence from the tanned and tired procession of voyagers who filed through the arrivals hall of Heathrow's Terminal 3 yesterday morning. Between the crowds of sombrero-wearing, surfboard-wielding travellers, Paul Francis Gadd, better known as Gary Glitter, was nowhere to be seen. But then the 64-year-old convicted paedophile and glam rocker had made different arrangements for his feverishly anticipated arrival back in Britain, or had different arrangements made for him. </p> <p>When Thai Airways flight TG910 touched down at 7.09am, Gadd was not met by friends or relatives. His welcoming committee comprised eight Metropolitan police officers who escorted him from the plane ahead of the other passengers and whisked him away from a frustrated gaggle of reporters, photographers and television crews. It was an abrupt climax to a bizarre week which has seen Gadd shunted from Thailand to Hong Kong and back to Thailand as he searched for a hiding hole after serving almost three years in a Vietnamese prison for committing obscene acts with two young girls. </p> <p>By 9am, with the disgraced rocker still nowhere to be seen, the press pack had decamped to the rainswept surroundings of Uxbridge magistrates court, where, rumour had it, he would appear to find out whether he would be put on the sex offenders' register for the rest of his life. Again, Gadd failed to materialise, apparently preferring to stay in an immigration office at Terminal 3. </p> <p>His lawyer, David Corker, told the court that his client had been wrongly convicted in Vietnam and questioned the conviction's legality under British law. \"This was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances. My client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice. We need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court.\" </p> <p>The Vietnamese justice system was \"far, far below what is acceptable in western European standards\". Rajeev Shetty, counsel for the Metropolitan police, said the case was clear. \"The fact remains that Mr Gadd was aware what the police were intending to do at least three or four days ago. Mr Gadd's situation is clear. Mr Gadd has been convicted of a relevant offence and the fact of that conviction cannot possibly be challenged.\"</p> <p>District judge David Simpson rejected the request, saying the conviction was not disputed and the conditions for an indefinite notification order had been met. Imposing the order that requires Gadd to sign the sex offenders' register within three days, he added: \"Mr Gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court.\" </p> <p>Under the terms of the order, Gadd will have to tell police where he plans to live and inform them of any travel plans. He will have 21 days to appeal.</p> <p>The cat-and-mouse hunt for Gadd continued into the afternoon, with reports that he had been spotted getting out of a taxi in Tooting, south London.</p> <p>\"He didn't seem to have any bags and was shouting at the taxi driver, asking him where he was,\" said Bob Bennett, a local, who added: \"He asked me the way to Tooting Broadway. I told him to hop on the number 76 bus. The kids at the bus stop were asking their mums 'Is that Gary Glitter?'\" </p> <p>Corker said his client was happy to be back in Britain and insisted that Gadd's days in international limbo, including the abortive trip to Hong Kong and the 20 hours he spent in the transit lounge of Bangkok airport, had not been wasted. \"It enabled Mr Gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival. Mr Gadd is not a well man, he needs medical attention and is also, unsurprisingly, concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the Metropolitan police and I, on his behalf, to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his wellbeing.\"</p> <p>The Vietnamese legal system had, he said, subjected Gadd to a \"show trial\". He added that Gadd hoped to have an opportunity to test his Vietnamese conviction in a British court. He said his client now had three days to work with the police. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Metropolitan police declined to comment on the case or on whether police protection was being provided. </p> <p>Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union, Napo, said that if reports that Gadd had millions in the bank were correct, any protection was unlikely to come out of the public purse. </p> <p>He added that Gadd's case was different to those of Maxine Carr, the ex-girlfriend of the Soham murderer Ian Huntley, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, who killed the Liverpool child James Bulger. \"They had their identities changed, but here we have someone in the public eye and in terms of a new identity, you can't really give him one. I would have thought that the police will conclude that the measures they have to put in place will be minimal.\"</p> <p>Some reports yesterday suggested Gadd was considering a move to the West Country. How long he can keep his new location a secret is another question.</p> <h2>Unwelcome traveller</h2> <p><strong>Tuesday, August 19 </strong></p> <p>After being released from jail Gadd leaves Vietnam for Thailand. He refuses to board a connecting flight to Britain but is denied entry to Thailand. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday, August 20 </strong></p> <p>More than 20 hours after arriving in Thailand he boards a flight to Hong Kong. Gadd is refused entry to Hong Kong and returns to Bangkok.</p> <p><strong>Thursday, August 21 </strong></p> <p>Gadd leaves Bangkok on a flight bound for England.</p> <p><strong>Friday, August 22 </strong></p> <p>Gadd arrives in London amid a media frenzy and is met by eight uniformed police officers as he leaves the plane.</p>",
  "<p>As almost everyone in at least two hemispheres knows, next week's Democratic party convention will be the most important four days so far in the life of Barack Obama. Having just barely regained some footing after two disastrous weeks in which he took a beach holiday while enduring a barrage of Republican attacks and saw his lead over John McCain vaporise, Obama arrives in Denver with his future on the line.</p> <p>But another prominent figure has a lot at stake, too. For Howard Dean, the Democratic party chairman who will oversee the proceedings in the Rocky mountain city, it's not so much about his own future, but his party's future and his legacy as a political leader.</p> <p>In his three and a half years on the job, Dean has dramatically departed from the traditional role of a US party chairman. Despite the lofty title, historically the chairman has been a glorified bursar. Their job has been to raise money, placate the donors and otherwise keep a low profile. </p> <p>But Dean has done it differently. He has been a mediocre fundraiser. What he has tried to do instead is transform the thinking inside the party. And he's done better at that than many sceptics would ever have thought.</p> <p>\"I hope we've changed the way we do Democratic politics in this country,\" Dean told the Guardian. \"And I think it will lead to the election of Barack Obama as president.\" If it does, Dean will have to go down as one of the most innovative and successful Democratic chairmen of the last 50 years.</p> <p>The 59-year-old's journey has been an improbable one. He grew up in a Republican family in the poshest of posh surroundings - New York City's upper east side and the Hamptons. He went to Yale, famously requesting, in his first year, that he be assigned to live with a black roommate. His medical training took him to Vermont where, in 1980, he led a successful campaign to halt the construction of a condominium building (he wanted a bicycle trail). He entered politics and, like so many before and after him, got the bug. He became the state's lieutenant governor, cutting ribbons and attending funerals. But then, in 1991, the governor died. Suddenly Dean was one of 50 elite politicians in the US. </p> <p>He was a moderate and even penny-pinching governor, not considered a liberal at all. But as he watched the country's radical swing to the right under George Bush, he inched left. The story from there is more familiar. The failed presidential campaign. The infamous Iowa scream, which haunts him still on late-night talk shows. The penchant for deeply impolitic statements (\"I hate the Republicans\"). The emergence, due to conservatives' repetition, of his name as a synonym for elitist, latte-sipping, gay-loving, America-bashing liberalism. </p> <p>Those attacks endeared him to the party's core constituencies. After John Kerry lost to Bush in 2004, the time came to select a new party chairman. Dean was one of seven candidates. The big party leaders - Senate majority leader Harry Reid, House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi and others - were mortified at the prospect of this radioactive presence becoming the titular leader of their party. </p> <p>But there was nothing they could do about it. The party chairman is chosen by national committee members - party activists spread across the country. These people, livid at their leadership for blowing another election with their pusillanimity and caution, loved Dean's in-your-face, partisan style. In February 2005, they made him chairman.</p> <p>The pre-Dean practice in the party had been built on two foundations. First, that electing a president is really all that mattered (as opposed to, say, building the party at grassroots level). Second, that the way to elect a president is concentrate on a handful of \"swing states,\" such as Ohio, Florida and Michigan, not worry about states that were already Democratic, such as New York, and write off all the Republican states.</p> <p>That is what Dean changed. He implemented his now-famous \"50-state strategy\". Hiring party organisers in every state, even ruby-red Oklahoma and Alabama. Paying them actual salaries, even. Spending money not just to win the election but to build a national infrastructure that could bear fruit into the next generation, or two. Does it seem obvious? Well, no one thought of it before. </p> <p>Three years on, Dean feels justified - for now. Asked whether his strategy will receive the ultimate vindication of electing a president, he said: \"I think it remains to be seen. But so far I feel my approach has been the right one. We have a congressional majority in some large proportions in the House, and I think we're going to certainly gain in the Senate. And where we're going to gain in the Senate is places like Virginia and Alaska and Colorado and New Mexico [all states that voted for Bush in 2004]. That's essentially expanding the playing field, which is what this is all about.\"</p> <p>He has made important converts. \"As many people know, Governor Dean was not my first choice to become head of the DNC, nor was he necessarily my second choice,\" said Harry Reid. \"But the success of his 50-state strategy has made a big believer out of me.\" Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, said: \"The 50-state strategy has helped bring more people into the process. Democrats from Barack Obama to House candidates across the country are competing in even bright red states. This will be a great Democratic year.\"</p> <p>Not everyone is a believer. There is a certain family, rather prominent in Democratic politics, that is known never to have liked Dean. The female head of that household has millions of passionate followers, and many of them think Howard Dean rigged the primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. They point especially to hotly disputed votes from Florida and Michigan, states Clinton won but which saw their vote allocation cut in half by an official party committee ecause they violated party rules about when to hold their primaries. </p> <p>The charge doesn't hold water - party chairmen used to dictate outcomes like that in the era of the smoke-filled room, but those days are gone. Still, some Clintonistas thumb their collective nose at pleas for unity, calling themselves PUMAs (party unity, my ass), and 18-25% of them, according to polls, say they're voting for John McCain.</p> <p>Dean insists he has worked assiduously to appease them. \"I truly believe that we are much more unified than the media is writing about because of their tendency to focus on the nail that sticks up rather than what's really going on,\" he said.</p> <p>One very important Clinton backer sounded only partially pacified. Alan Patricof, one of Clinton's most prominent finance staff, said Dean \"has tried very hard to keep things smooth\". But he added: \"A different person with closer relationships with some people might have been able to push people around. Howard wasn't able to push people around.\"</p> <p>Dean says, \"I'm a huge fan of Hillary's and always have been.\" Whether the feeling is mutual is at the very least open to question. But if Barack Obama is elected president, what will it matter?</p> <p>As Dean knows, for all his successes at the state and local levels, a party chairman's legacy comes down to one question: did the party elect a president on his watch? Dean remains confident about Obama's chances, and he likes the way the nominee has embraced the Dean strategy of expanding the map, fighting for votes in states such as Indiana and North Carolina, where Democrats haven't even tried for years. Dean sees his legacy as being about both Obama and that expansion.</p> <p>\"I'm not the one to judge myself,\" he said. \"My own view is this party desperately needed to be shaken up and turned around. And we've done that. I believe we're going to win the presidency. But I don't think we're going to go back to the old days of trying to eke out a victory by six electoral votes and focus on just 20 states. I don't think we're going to go back to that model anymore.\"</p> <p>The fact that next week's convention is in Denver, a red state in what is sometimes called \"flyover country\", makes that clear. The party has changed. But now, the change needs to result in a win.</p>",
  "<p>In the weeks leading up to the prime minister's departure for Beijing, Tibetans and their supporters urged Gordon Brown to make a strong public statement about China's broken promises on human rights and on the need for an independent investigation into the situation in Tibet. </p> <p>En route to Beijing, the prime minister told reporters that he would be raising human rights concerns and the situation in Tibet with Chinese leaders. No promise was made to make a strong public statement, but hopes were raised that the British government might finally stand up for the Tibetan people. </p> <p>Sadly, that has not turned out to be the case. Instead of condemning the lockdown of Tibet and the ongoing suppression of peaceful protests or calling publicly for an immediate independent investigation, the prime minister is today praising the Chinese government for temporarily <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/22/foreignpolicy.gordonbrown\">lifting reporting restrictions for foreign journalists</a>.</p> <p>This lifting of restrictions for foreign media (although never for Chinese media) was the only Olympic promise the Chinese made even the most cursory attempt to keep. Foreign journalists were told they would be able to travel wherever they wanted and speak to whomever they pleased \u2013 except in Tibet, which would still require a visa and a minder. The new measures came into effect in January 2007 and are scheduled to end in October 2008. </p> <p>All too predictably, within days of protests breaking out in Tibet in March, the Chinese authorities had evicted all foreign journalists. Communication with people in Tibet has become increasingly difficult, with Tibetans afraid to speak to outsiders and mobile phones being cut off (or being answered by Chinese voices demanding to know who is calling). <br> Despite this, a picture is emerging from various sources of Tibet as a country in lockdown. The <a href=\"http://www.freetibet.org/\">Free Tibet</a> campaign has provided a briefing detailing huge military build-ups in many areas of Tibet, with checkpoints on almost every corner and early evening curfews imposed. Undercover Channel 4 footage has shown snipers positioned on rooftops in Lhasa. Respected China analyst <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121935422617061449.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">Willy Lam</a> today suggests the Chinese regime's pre-Olympics security build-up has been planned to enable a major crackdown on dissent after the games are over.</p> <p>Does the prime minister have anything to say about this? Not really. According to Gordon Brown, \"there is more common ground between the Chinese authorities and Tibet than is sometimes realised\". Really? The Tibetan people think they should be allowed to own an image of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The Chinese government thinks Tibetans should be tortured and imprisoned for owning an image of the Dalai Lama. This sounds more like a gaping chasm than common ground. </p> <p>It is very dispiriting to hear the prime minister yet again endorsing the so-called talks between Chinese authorities and the Tibetan government-in-exile. After the most recent round of talks in July, the Dalai Lama's special envoy Lodi Gyari was forced to concede: </p> <blockquote> <p>In the course of our discussions we were compelled to candidly convey to our counterparts that in the absence of serious and sincere commitment on their part the continuation of the present dialogue process would serve no purpose.</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite this, the British government continues to hide behind these talks, holding up this charade as evidence that the Chinese government is willing to seriously negotiate loosening its iron grip on Tibet, its people and its vast mineral resources. </p> <p>Gordon Brown is known to pride himself on developing close personal friendships with the Chinese leaders. Friends tell friends when their behaviour is unacceptable.</p> <p>If, whilst accepting Chinese government hospitality at the Olympics, the prime minister makes no stronger public stand about the human rights violations in Tibet, he will be shaming himself and he will be shaming the citizens he represents.</p>",

It sounds like he's...<em>already trying to act presidential!</em> This was a huge no-no three weeks ago when Obama was supposedly doing it. </p> <p>This is not a massive political issue, but it <em>is </em>deeply baffling. Why in the world are nine vehicles needed to procure a cappuccino? What could possibly be in all those cars?</p> <p>I learned a little something about this following Hillary around upstate New York in 2000. But to the best of my memory, she (the alleged self-regarding ice queen etc etc) had a three-car entourage. Her van (dubbed HRC Speedwagon), and two cars of Secret Service people, one mostly laden (we assumed and guessed) with firearms, the other with human agents. It may have been four. But it sure wasn't <em>nine.</em> </p>",

  "<p>Peter Kay is to return to Channel 4 for the first time in four years with a new satire on reality TV as part of a special night dedicated to the comedian.</p> <p>The show, which is one of the highlights of Channel 4's new autumn schedule unveiled today in Edinburgh, has been given the lengthy title Britain's Got the Pop Factor and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice - which is sure to cause havoc with the electronic programme guide.</p> <p>Kay's new Channel 4 show is billed as a \"celebration\" of TV talent programmes. It will air alongside a documentary fronted by the comedian, with the shorter title of Raider of the Pop Charts, which will feature his success in the pop and video charts.</p> <p>Other Channel 4 autumn highlights include factual series Boys and Girls Alone, which will see a group of children left together in a house in order for them to \"organise their own communities free from adult interference\". The show is billed as giving a \"fascinating look\" at gender differences.</p> <p>Channel 4 will also launch a year-long programming initiative around the theme of The State of the Nation, in which it will put a range of British social and public institutions under the spotlight.</p> <p>The project will encompass several observational documentary series as well as current affairs programmes, a single drama and a campaigning season.</p> <p>The head of Channel 4, Julian Bellamy, said: \"This is an incredibly ambitious and large scale undertaking that puts documentaries at the heart of the channel over the next year. </p> <p>\"It demonstrates our commitment to commissioning innovative but accessible programmes that address contemporary issues and stimulate public debate.\"</p> <p>The State of the Nation initiative will launch in September with landmark observational documentary series The Family, which Channel 4 has described as one of the most ambitious shows it has ever commissioned. </p> <p>This eight part series, directed by Bafta-award winner Jonathan Smith for Firefly Productions, will attempt to portray British life in the 21st century and was filmed around the clock over four months.</p> <p>The series will follow on from Paul Watson's seminal documentary series The Family in 1974.</p> <p>Other upcoming Channel 4 shows include the four-part series, Life and Death at 18, which will examine how the NHS is coping; while The Force will document the reality of policing in the 21st century. </p> <p>The Hunt for Britain's Sex Traffickers will explore human trafficking in the UK. Benefit Business, to be made by former RDF creative director Stephen Lambert's new firm Studio Lambert, will follow the government's overhaul of the welfare system. </p> <p>A season on adoption will include a documentary with the working title Adopt Me, in which five sets of prospective adopters are given hands-on parenting experience to encourage them to consider adopting some of the hardest children to place.</p> <p>In other programmes, Catastrophe - a working title - will combine CGI effects and scientific discoveries to investigate Earth's history of natural disasters, from planetary collisions to asteroid impacts. </p> <p>Drama will be headlined by four-part English civil war epic The Devil's Whore; while The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall will depict the aftermath of the death of a British student at the hands of an Israeli sniper in 2003. </p> <p>Jamie Oliver travels to Rotherham to launch his latest campaign and face some of his critics in four-part documentary, Jamie's Ministry of Food.

  "<p>When I got my first British Museum Reader's Card it was like getting a visa for Tibet. Full body cavity searches were, one felt, imminent. But once you had that ticket in your hand it was Aladdin's Cave. Your buttocks rested on seats warmed by Marx, by Shaw, by Woolf (or, if you were unlucky, that strange lady in the plastic shorts).</p> <p>That was half a century ago. Now, at the St Pancras British Library, it's Liberty Hall. If you're over eighteen, welcome; no questions asked, no condition imposed. The result has been a prolonged howl of pain from \"bona fide\" scholars. During the exam season, last June, the line outside the BL at 9:30 stretched back to the Euston Road. The race for desks, thereafter, was to the swift.</p> <p>Elite BL users less fleet of foot than their undergraduate rivals, such as <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/21/blhell\">Tristram Hunt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/22/news.culture\">Lady Antonia Fraser</a>, have complained eloquently about the new open door regime.</p> <p>The principal item of complaint is that the mass of users do not need the BL as, for example, world class historians need it. These interlopers, it is alleged, merely find the BL a comfortable place to park themselves, taking up every available seat. Meanwhile, over there in the corner, Tristram stands, gnashing his teeth.</p> <p>One can understand the frustration of the bona fide scholar. But there is a dimension to the issue which complicates things.</p> <p>I have taught, for 35 years now, at the university closest to the BL, UCL. When I arrived there in the early 70s, there were some 6,000 students and a library with fifty or so desks in the English section, most unoccupied. You could always find somewhere for a couple of hours' library work. Now UCL has twice that many young bodies milling about. Where there used to be spacious, invitingly empty, reading rooms there are now computer clusters. And no free desks.</p> <p>Put yourself in the position of a third year undergraduate who has a lecture at 10 a.m. and a seminar at 4 p.m. and an essay to get in for a crack-of-dawn tutorial the next morning. Where do you write that essay?</p> <p>Walk through the campus at busy times during the term and you see desperate students sitting on the floor in corridors, tapping away on their laptops, or scrawling on yellow pads. Some go to coffee bars, and nurse a long-cooled latte for hours, while they put their great thoughts on paper, or screen, braving the angry looks of the manager. I daresay some go to stalls in the restrooms to write their essay.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the pull of the BL's 1800 comfortable, computer connected seats, proves irresistible. Not because students want to inconvenience Lady Antonia Fraser but because there's nowhere else convenient for the work they themselves need to do. Don't resent them, resent the circumstances that drive them there.</p> <p>Universities need quiet, well-lit, warm areas where a young person can spread themselves out, think, and write, in a calm bookish - above all, uncrowded - atmosphere. Make room! make room! And not just for the bona fide scholars.</p>",
  "<p>August can be the cruellest month in Hollywood. Too late for blockbuster season and its attendant box office propaganda and too soon for September's return to interesting fare, August nestles there like a low-yield aberration on the releasing calendar. This is the time when Hollywood goes on vacation before the festival frenzy of Venice and Toronto ushers in the awards season. This is traditionally a time to clear the decks of the oddities, the movies that haven't tracked well or those that feature untested stars. August is where movies go to die. But that said, there may be a few surprises in store.</p> <p>When Sony releases its comedy The House Bunny today, America could be about to witness the birth of a star. Anna Faris is already well known as the lead in the Scary Movie horror spoof franchise and for that scene-stealing turn as the ditzy celebrity in Lost in Translation. However until now she's never been called upon to open a major stand-alone movie. She rose through the ranks on Scary Movie \u2013 she started as part of an ensemble and is now undoubtedly the franchise's jewel in the crown \u2013 but The House Bunny is the first time she has been front and centre of a sizeable studio release.</p> <p>No pressure, then. But I reckon Faris will come up smelling of roses. Her natural comic gifts have charmed the critics once again and this story from the screenwriters behind Legally Blonde may not have the chops to reach number one, but it could be enough to catapult its Seattle-born star into the big league. Some critics even went as far as to say she resembles a young Goldie Hawn and while I think that's fair, I believe Faris will impress everyone with her range in the future. But for now she's a funny girl and there's always room in filmgoers' hearts for a giggly, adorable bombshell. According to the box office experts The House Bunny will end up in the top five and may gross up to $15m (\u00a38m) in its first three days.</p> <p>Rainn Wilson is another rising star in action this weekend, albeit one whose parameters may be a little more modest. Wilson has benefited hugely from his role as the foil to Steve Carell in the US version of The Office and tackles his first lead in Fox's comedy The Rocker. Britain's Peter Cattaneo of The Full Monty fame directed Wilson as a failed drummer from a rock band who gets a second bite at the cherry. </p> <p>The studios are prepared to push buttons when it comes to promoting their movies and this one has been no exception. The Rocker opened on Wednesday this week, a strategy that has become de rigueur of late, and Fox had the chutzpah to start calling The Rocker \"The sleeper hit of the summer\" on its billboard campaign more than a week before it opened.</p> <p>Most people expect Death Race to streak past the finishing line first this weekend. The remake of Roger Corman's 1975 violent action thriller Death Race 2000 stars our very own Jason Statham in the David Carradine role as a convict whose driving skills come in handy while he's in the clink. Tyrese Gibson reprises Sylvester Stallone's role as the baddie Machine Gun Joe. Britain's Paul W S Anderson, who counts Resident Evil and Event Horizon on his resume, directed the mayhem. Statham has a huge following in the States and has the clout to open a movie, although audiences have seen plenty of action this summer and it may struggle to get past $20m in its first weekend.</p> <p>And while we're on the subject of actors tying to be find that recognition they deserve, it would be remiss to ignore Steve Coogan. It must be \u2013 what? galling? depressing? \u2013 for Coogan to watch the meteoric Hollywood rise of his compatriots Rickey Gervais and Simon Pegg while he, a longtime TV star, is still trying to find the key to success in the movies over here. After the theatrical disappointments of Around the World in 80 Days and Alibi, it is the turn of Hamlet 2, a raucous comedy about a drama teacher who stages a controversial school play, to bring Coogan the success he richly deserves.</p> <p>The movie drew a wild response when it premiered at Sundance last January and proved a timely antidote to the festival, which was overall rather dark in tone. Focus Features swooped on worldwide rights for approximately $10m (\u00a35.4m) \u2013 a huge deal that will need to bear fruit. The movie gets a tiny launch this weekend so the name of the game will be per-theatre averages, a pound-for-pound evaluation in which a distributor divides the overall gross by the number of cinemas it is playing in. Hamlet 2 will expand into further cinemas next weekend.</p> <p>Ice Cube is a well-established star and takes the lead in a new sports drama called The Longshots, directed by former Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst and released through MGM. Estimates put it in the $6m (\u00a33.2m) opening weekend range. Lest we forget, The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder remain active and both will expect top five finishes.</p> <p>The Dark Knight enters its sixth weekend on approximately $480m (\u00a3257.1m) and could end the weekend close to $500m (\u00a3267.8m), while Tropic Thunder will drop around 50% in its second weekend and is looking at boosting its tally by about $15m (\u00a38m) to the low $60m (\u00a332.1m) mark.</p>",

  "<p>I'd like to think that I am the type of girl who is not afraid to try anything once. But recently I've been discovering that I have my limits. Perhaps it's down to the jar of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_egg\">pickled eggs</a> currently taking pride of place in my boyfriend's fridge, or the fact that a recent discussion with one of my friends led to me confessing that I've never eaten a <a href=\"http://www.unilever.co.uk/ourbrands/foods/peperami.asp\">pepperami</a>, but I came to a rather stark realisation a few weeks ago. </p> <p>At the ripe old age of twenty-five-and-a-half, I have never eaten a <a href=\"http://www.potnoodle.com/\">Pot Noodle</a>. Or a <a href=\"http://www.meltonmowbrayporkpies.com\">pork pie</a>. Or, for that matter a <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/SCOTCH-EGGS-11508\">Scotch egg</a>. Actually, if I think about it there are a surprising number of things which I've never even dared to put to my lips for fear of what they would do to my insides. It's not that I don't like these products - after all, you can't actively dislike things you've never tasted - it's just that the thought of them turns my stomach.<br><br>Now, this isn't to say that I'm averse to the more \"traditional\" side of British cuisine - after all, in my heady student days I was once served - and ate - a <a href=\"http://www.qualitystreet.co.uk/home/\">Quality Street</a> filled toasted sandwich. And anyone who's ever been out for dinner with me can vouch for the fact that I'm not exactly a fussy eater. It's more the thought of what these products contain. </p> <p>Take the jelly in a pork pie for instance. Now, on first impression, a pork pie - or a 'growler' if you're from Yorkshire - looks like a delicious snack. After all (unless you're a vegetarian) what's there not to like about seasoned pork in a tasty pastry case? That is, of course, until you get to the jelly. For me, jelly is something which you find at children's parties served with ice cream. It does not belong in a savoury context and most certainly should not taste of reconstituted pig products. In fact, the very thought of it is making my stomach feel a touch queasy.</p> <p>Don't even get me started on Scotch eggs. No argument would ever convince me to allow one of those things to pass my lips (although I may just have been put off for life after watching a friend of mine attempt to fit fifty mini Scotch eggs all in his mouth at once. He succeeded, by the way, even if they did make a reappearance soon afterwards).</p> <p>I thought I was alone in having never tasted common food items which are often seen as a staple of the British diet, but a quick discussion on the <a href=\"http://community.livejournal.com/theladiesloos/profile\">Ladies Loos community</a> on Livejournal threw up some interesting revelations. For example, a number of people said that they would never eat offal such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripe\">tripe</a>, liver, or <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-sweetbreads.htm\">sweetbreads</a>, which is understandable to an extent considering that they are deemed to be quite an acquired taste (as well as being foodstuffs which are less commonly consumed nowadays then they were 50 years ago). </p> <p>But then again, you wouldn't believe the numbers of people who refuse to touch seafood because they refuse to eat anything with a face (something with which I can actually sympathise, never having been too keen on my dinner looking up beseechingly at me from the plate). </p> <p>Or that there exist people in this world who despise <a href=\"http://www.jafferygoodness.com/\">jaffa cakes</a>, a product which to me is up there with a good medium rare cooked steak in terms of culinary nirvana. Someone else admitted to me that they have never tasted ketchup because of the way it smells and have a horror of mayonnaise.</p> <p>It appears that everyone has something which they've never eaten for one reason or another, be it dietary, religious, or because to them it's just downright disgusting. What's yours?</p>"
