  "<p>A food crisis is highly likely in the UK, with price and availability becoming issues that swing the outcome of future elections, according to a report from the thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>The UK's food system is unable to cope with rapid changes in supply driven by climate change, rising energy prices and population growth, the report says. Consumers are likely to have to accept a shift from individual preferences to a system in which government and industry have to ensure the food that is sold reflects the wider needs of society. The report, made available in draft to the Guardian, will be published next month. Hilary Benn, the environment, food and rural affairs secretary, used the first day of a Chatham House conference yesterday on the future of food to announce the creation of a food policy council to advise government on costs and security of supply.</p> <p>In what appeared to be a shift in policy, he said: \"With rising prices and increasing demand across the globe, we can't take our food supply for granted. </p> <p>\"Our supply needs to be reliable and resilient and able to withstand shocks and crises.\" </p> <p>In an indication of the government's concern about the effect of food price rises, Benn was asked to update Gordon Brown's national economic council on the UK's food supply yesterday. </p> <p>The Chatham House study concludes that the British government does not yet fully understand the challenges it faces over food in the 10 years. It identifies serious challenges to world agriculture:</p> <p>\u2022 UK consumers use food at a rate that represents six times more land and sea than is available to them. </p> <p>\u2022 Developed countries face a chronic shortage of migrant workers, leading to the loss of seasonal crops. In Scotland up to a fifth of the soft fruit crop, worth \u00a35.2m, could be lost in 2008. </p> <p>\u2022 The equivalent of 20 Nile rivers move annually from developing to developed countries, but much of agriculture's use of water is unsustainable. </p> <p>\u2022 Modern food production is energy-intensive and vulnerable to oil and gas price rises. </p> <p>\u2022 Rising prices of agricultural commodities have already produced pressure for more protectionism. Russia plans to form a state grain trading company to control up to half of its cereal exports. </p> <p>\u2022 Falling yields due to climate change will inflate food prices further. </p> <p>\u2022 The rapid rise in world population will continue to push up demand. </p> <p>\u2022 Emerging economies such as China and India are shifting to more meat and dairy products. This will cause greater pressure on food and feed prices, and exacerbate environmental and health problems. </p> <p>\"Other countries have already started looking at food in strategic terms. It's about time the UK did the same,\" said Kate Bailey, who led the research for the project.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly a quarter of the world's land mammal species are at risk of extinction, and many others may vanish before they are even known to science, according to an extensive survey of global wildlife. At least 1,141 of the 5,487 known species of mammal are threatened, with 188 listed in the \"critically endangered\" category. One in three marine mammals are also threatened, according to the five-year review.</p> <p>The assessment, conducted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list, involved more than 1,700 experts in 130 countries, and confirms the devastating impact of forest clearing, hunting, fisheries, pollution and climate change on the populations and ranges of the world's most studied class of animals. </p> <p>Jan Schipper, director of the global mammals assessment, a partnership between Conservation International and the IUCN, called for countries to be held responsible for the fate of fauna within their borders and an international coalition to save species that cross national boundaries.<br><br>\"We're looking at a 25% decline over the long term, yet for mammals there is no bail-out plan. There is no long-term conservation strategy that is going to prevent species extinction in the future,\" he said. \"As human beings, we should be ensuring that we don't cause other species to go extinct.\" </p> <p>Disturbingly, the figures are likely to be a conservative estimate, because scientists have insufficient data on 836 species to even classify how threatened they are. If these are all at risk, it would mean 36% of the world's mammal species are in danger of becoming extinct.</p> <p>Among the critically endangered species is the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), with only 84 to 143 adults remaining. </p> <p>Experts believe 29 others may already have become extinct, including the Yangtze river dolphin, and the little earth hutia, a small rodent endemic to islands off Cuba, which has not been seen in nearly 40 years. Two species, the scimitar-horned oryx and P\u00e8re David's deer, are extinct in the wild, and only live on in captivity. Many species, such as the grey wolf and brown bear, have experienced substantial population declines and seen their ranges contract as their habitats have been destroyed. </p> <p>More than half of the world's mammal species for which trends are known are in decline, the report found.</p> <p>\"We are getting far too used to seeing these reports bemoaning the fate of the planet or the decline of animals. I am really concerned that we have become deadened to this sort of depressing information and now simply ignore it, without stopping to think about the implications,\" said Mark Wright, chief scientist at WWF. \"The IUCN report shows that, with our ill-considered management of the Earth and its resources, we are threatening the future of wildlife and nature and denying our children the chance to experience what we have experienced.\"</p> <p>The survey, which is published by the journal Science today, identifies extinction hotspots where vast numbers of species are under threat. </p> <p>Typically, these are regions with a rich diversity of species that all face a similar threat to their environment. Threatened land mammals are concentrated in south and south-east Asia. There, a staggering 79% of monkeys and apes face extinction. Other hotspots include the tropical Andes, the Cameroonian Highlands, the Albertine rift in central Africa and the Western Ghats in India.</p> <p>\"Often, there is habitat loss from deforestation, either for farming or timber, and that leaves the animals living on small patches of land. Then, on top of that, you have hunting, with an enormous number of people who are entirely reliant on natural resources to feed themselves. That has really set up a perfect storm over south-east Asia,\" said Schipper.</p> <p>The greatest threats to marine mammals are being caught in fishing nets or being struck by shipping vessels, although for the Yangtze river dolphin, pollution is a major contributor.</p> <p>Climate change is already having an impact on amphibians and plant life, but it is expected to put increasing pressure on mammals too, either by destroying their environment, such as the Arctic ice sheets that are home to polar bears, or by forcing their prey elsewhere.</p> <p>Among the most threatened mammals are those only recently discovered. Since 1992, 349 new mammal species have been identified, but 51% of these face extinction, compared with 23% of species known before 1992. </p> <p>\"Species may be vanishing even before they are known to science,\" the scientists write in the journal.</p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope among the bleak assessments. At least 5% of the currently threatened species now have stable or rising populations, many of which are the focus of huge conservation efforts. </p> <p>\"The problem we face is that without the political and public will to spend money on species conservation, we are pressed up against the wall,\" said Schipper. \"By making this data public, we're hoping it'll reach the people who make decisions about where money is spent.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is fair to say the 205-year-old military barracks in Chelsea, the Duke of York's headquarters, have never housed anything quite like it. </p> <p>Behind the tall doric columns of the building's grand entrance yesterday were large skeletons of imaginary mutant monsters and models of naked migrant workers hanging from the ceiling. The installations were at Charles Saatchi's much delayed, but undeniably ambitious, gallery which will open to the public on Thursday.</p> <p>It is the art collector's third London venue: the first Saatchi gallery in a disused paint factory in St John's Wood opened in 1985 and often showcased Young British Artists. The second, in County Hall on the South Bank, ended in rancourous eviction after two years in 2005. </p> <p>The third gallery has taken three years to get right, about a year longer than planned, and opens with an exhibition devoted to contemporary Chinese art - all of it new to the UK.</p> <p>Saatchi has clearly spent a small fortune - one which he refuses to put a figure on publicly - and has been involved in all aspects of the building and the art in it. </p> <p>He was there yesterday despite the presence of so many of the types he normally tries to avoid: journalists. But exactly where, was another question. </p> <p>\"He's around yes, but no Charles won't be talking to the press,\" said Rebecca Wilson, the gallery's director. \"That's what I'm here for.\"</p> <p>Wilson accepted the gallery had taken longer than planned. \"There have been quite a few delays, she said.</p> <p>\"Because it's a Georgian building there were all sorts of things we had to respect and couldn't do but actually the great thing about Georgian architecture is that its perfect for displaying art. </p> <p>\"There are very clean lines, it's very unfussy, so we've maintained the proportions.\"</p> <p>It certainly is a big space, about 70,000sq ft, with 15 gallery spaces.</p> <p>\"It's absolutely massive, it really is, you feel like you're walking into a museum,\" said Wilson. \"It's like walking in to the Guggenheim and if you think of what Boundary Road [Saatchi's St John's Wood space] and County Hall were like, it is has gone up several layers in terms of the scale of it and what we can actually do here.\"</p> <p>Saatchi has supervised all the hanging. In a Q&amp;A for the Sunday Times, earlier this week, he revealed how he does it. \"I just go by what shapes and colours work together in a room,\" he said. \"The poncey way some curators try to demonstrate their 'vision' by highlighting connections gives me the collywobbles.\"</p> <p>Wilson was slightly more diplomatic. \"The rooms have been curated by Charles. He really hangs everything, it's all his eye,\" she said. \"There is a feeling now that curators almost see themselves as on a par with artists don't they? It's the curator's vision which is meant to lend some great kind of light and often it's a really spurious illumination of the work. It's much more about the work. There's no message except these are 24 really interesting artists from China.\" </p> <p>All the work comes from Saatchi's collection of about 2,500 pieces and the next 10 or so exhibitions are already being organised. The next show will be an exhibition of Middle Eastern art and in the pipeline are a big sculpture show next year and others featuring new American and British artists.</p> <p>Wilson admitted it was a relief to be open and the final hurdle is in sight. There is a party for London's great and good tonight. Saatchi is not expected but his wife Nigella Lawson is - and the public will enter for free from Thursday. </p> <p>While many have fond memories of Saatchi's Boundary Road gallery (he hosted exhibitions by the likes of Cy Twombly, Richard Serra and Jeff Koons as well as the YBAs), not many have good memories of County Hall. It was not a good exhibition space and the tenancy ended when a judge ruled that Saatchi's company had shown a \"deliberate disregard\" to the rights of the landlord.</p>",
  "<p>In Paris, fashion is about more than just frivolity. The relationship between a French woman and her wardrobe is somehow both more intimate and more formal than the equivalent in Britain. Whereas London style is all about expressing that week's passing obsession (and blowing that week's wages) on a pair of dancing shoes that channel Angelina Jolie/the Little Mermaid/Marge Simpson, or whoever we're loving that week, Paris is more about buying an Herm\u00e8s scarf and spending the next 30 years keeping the love alive by finding subtly new ways to wear it. </p> <p>The French are currently feeling pretty smug about the whole Herm\u00e8s scarf approach. And frankly, who can blame them, since the modern British love affair with sticking an endless stream of fast-fashion purchases on the credit card isn't looking too clever right now, on either a macro or micro level? (Herm\u00e8s, by the way, recently reported a market-defying 14% rise in operating profit for the first half of this year.) </p> <p>To be honest, in the context of what was going on in the wider world, Paris fashion week's tendency to tortuously intellectualise every jacket sleeve made me want to scream at first. When I was told that for Stefano Pilati, designer at Yves Saint Laurent, \"spirit is given significance by trace and circumscribed space rather than by literal evidence ... The hard proof of a tangible reference is less important than its innocent kitsch appropriation,\" I thought (a) Sarah Palin's policy pronouncements make more sense and (b) get over yourself, mister, it's a jacket. </p> <p>But by the end of the week, I had changed my mind. In Paris, for cultural and economic reasons, the credit crunch and the banking crisis do not colour everything in the way they did when the fashion shows were being held in New York, London and Milan. And - call me superficial - I am frankly grateful for a different point of view. </p> <p>So far as there is a \"look\" to be derived from this week's shows, it goes something like this. It focuses on the shape of the torso and the shoulders: often a corsetted waist and ribs, contrasted with pointy, vaguely sci-fi shoulders. Sometimes there are straps tracing the lines of the ribs or looped in faintly fetishistic multiples around the shoulders. At Givenchy, the look was less gothic than last season, and more glam rock - that'll be the leather trousers with flame detailing along the thigh - but the intense, angular, skinny, black aesthetic remains essentially unchanged. At Stella, black bands were wrapped bandage-tight, in the style made famous by Azzedine Ala\u00efa. </p> <p>At Galliano and at John Galliano's Dior, the look was prettier and more feminine - a Battenberg palette of pink and yellow at Dior, dusty pastels at Galliano - but bare flesh was still criss-crossed by straps. At Rue du Mail, the strapped-up look was given a more relaxed, rive-gauche makeover, with draped rather than taut loops. The torso straps even appeared at Chanel, over the top of tweed suits. </p> <p>The catwalk alternative to the multi-strapped torso/pointy shoulders combination is the Victorian dummy shape. At McQueen and Balenciaga, the exaggerated proportions and curves of Victorian tailors' dolls served as the template for the clothes, contrasting (on purpose, one presumes) with the angular, curve-free bodies wearing them. </p> <p>Don't panic. We are not actually going to be wearing this. I know, because all week I've been watching what the French fashion editors wear. When they want to do a bit of a strappy thing, they wear a top with loose, draped straps (Vanessa Bruno does a good line in these) under a black jacket with pointy shoulders and maybe even a hem that points down at the front. They wear this with slim trousers and heels, or a short skirt and long boots. Often the finishing touch is a thin scarf wound around the neck, and there you have it: the same elegant-edgy, strappy-black thing without looking like a science-fiction prostitute. Alternatively, if they want to channel a bit of a Victorian dummy silhouette, they go with a tightly belted jacket over a very short, very full skirt, worn with ankle boots - this gives the same abrupt-looking, jagged silhouette. </p> <p>These straps and silhouettes, however, don't really make a trend by themselves. In Paris, as in the other fashion cities, this season of shows has failed to produce one headline-making, soundbite-friendly major trend: no Boho, no 60s. There was no consensus. But perhaps we don't need one. To allow Karl Lagerfeld, appropriately enough, the last word: \"As long as you agree with yourself, that's enough - non?\" </p> <h2>Paris fashion week: Five trends to take home</h2> <p><strong>Natural History Museum chic</strong></p> <p>The stegosaurus-spine sleeve seams we saw at Christopher Kane in London were reprised at both Chlo\u00e9 and Givenchy.

  "<p>One of American poetry's most distinctive voices, the writer and critic Hayden Carruth, has died aged 87. Although he found acclaim relatively late in life, his deceptively simple style, infused with the rhythms and inflections of jazz, explored themes of sorrow, loneliness and human dignity, but also bore witness to the ravages of mental illness. </p> <p>He survived two suicide attempts, and lived for many years in rural Vermont, where through working the land he found an antidote to the depression and existential torments that plagued him. After many years of neglect his work was recognised when his Collected Shorter Poems, 1946-1991 was awarded the 1992 National Book Critics Circle award for poetry, and in 1996 his collection Scrambled Eggs &amp; Whiskey won the National Book Award.</p> <p>Carruth was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, and, as his father and grandfather were journalists, he grew up surrounded by books. He graduated in journalism from the University of North Carolina in 1943 and, having married, spent two years with the air force in Italy. Thanks to the GI bill he was able to study for an MA in English at the University of Chicago: he began writing and briefly edited Poetry magazine. </p> <p>In 1951 the the New Directions publisher James Laughlin invited Carruth to work in New York on a cultural-exchange magazine in 1951. Divorced and then married again in 1952, Carruth missed his young daughter, Martha, who had gone to live with her mother, profoundly. Despite undergoing psychoanalysis, various phobias and alcoholism overtook him, and, in the summer of 1953, he was admitted to White Plains asylum. After 15 months - including electroconvulsive therapy, and games of solitaire while watching the televised McCarthy hearings - he was released and for five years lived in his parents' attic, where he carved out his own response to European existentialists such as Albert Camus, a profound influence and, later, the subject of his book After The Stranger: Imaginary Dialogues With Camus (1964).</p> <p>In 1959, again divorced, he resumed writing. Two years later, during a trip to the post office, he opened the first copy of his first full book, Journey to a Known Place. Excited, he not only showed it to an eastern European refugee in the queue, Rose Marie Dorn, but inscribed it to her. They married after three months, and moved into a dilapidated north Vermont house with 11 acres. </p> <p>Carruth worked the land while Rose Marie caught up with her education. They had a son, David, and were joined by Martha, who had become pregnant at 16. Many of those with whom the bearded Carruth baled hay were unaware of the writing that flowed by night. It is glib to call his poems existential but, long or short, they readily traverse such subjects as old jeans, cows at night, Adolf Eichmann, or snow: \"the minute percussion of settling flakes\". </p> <p>From 1971 until his death, he was an advisory editor on the Hudson Review and, after teaching in Vermont for a several years, Carruth joined the faculty at Syracuse University in upstate New York in 1979, where he taught and mentored many young poets. From 1977 to 1982, he was poetry editor of Harper's magazine. Despite this professional stability, in February 1988 he swallowed every pill he could find in his home. \"I was surprised, not disagreeably, by the quickness of the effect,\" he later wrote, and in hospital, where charcoal lessened the toxins, a mirror revealed that his beard had gone. \"I looked 85 years old. It was as close to seeing myself dead as I expect to come.\"</p> <p>Resilient, and reflecting that the words \"happen\" and \"happy\" both derive from Old Norse for luck, he resumed work - and the beard. Once again divorced, the following year he married the poet Joe-Anne McLaughlin, 30 years his junior. They moved to upstate New York, and their life there is evoked in the extraordinary series of letters he sent to the poet Donald Hall's dying wife in 1994 (Letters to Jane, 2004). Equally affecting is his extempore elegy to Martha the night she died in 1997 from cancer. </p> <p>Carruth once imagined his own ashes buried by a tree: \"Not much humus will accrue, but at least a little\"; his books, however, sustain new vistas at every turn. He is survived by his wife and son.</p> <p>\u2022 Hayden Carruth, poet and critic, born August 3 1921; died September 29 2008</p>",

The suit, filed on Friday, seeks more than $250,000 (\u00a3144,000) on five defamation and related counts from Winfrey and her production company.

  "<p>A gardener accused of poisoning a retired high court judge's cherished flower border because he was upset at being sacked was cleared by magistrates yesterday. </p> <p>Peter Hancock was accused of causing \u00a3500 damage to a border and lawn at Sir Richard Tucker's Cotswolds estate following a falling-out with the judge's wife, garden designer Lady Jacqueline Tucker. Hancock, who worked for Sir Richard for 20 years, admitted spraying the lawn and plants with mosskiller but said he had harmed them by accident before he was sacked. </p> <p>Gloucester magistrates were told that Hancock, 45, had tended plants and lawns at the Tuckers' \u00a31.5m home in the Cotswolds once a week for more than 20 years. But he did not see eye to eye with Lady Jacqueline and was sacked. </p> <p>Two weeks later, the Tuckers returned from holiday in the south of France to find a flower border, including spectacular elephant ear plants, and grass verge looking very sorry. Sir Richard called in the police. </p> <p>The retired judge told magistrates Hancock was \"temperamental and moody\". He said: \"He had to be handled with a velvet glove. I sacked him because he became very moody and his attitude to my wife became aggressive.\"</p> <p>The court heard that Sir Richard's friend Kenneth Ryland claimed to have seen Hancock spraying his former employer's plants during his holiday. </p> <p>But Hancock told the court he had sprayed the plants in good faith before being sacked. He returned to spray fertiliser on the area to try to sort the problem out while the Tuckers were away, which was when he was spotted by Ryland. </p> <p>Hancock, of Tewkesbury, was found not guilty of criminal damage.</p>",
  "<p>Blackpool is not the best place for the parties to hold their conferences: it excites in the visitor a keen sense of national decline. The idea of building a \"Better Tomorrow\" or a \"New Britain\" becomes inherently ludicrous after a few days here.</p> <p>Nobody I know likes Blackpool and that's not just snotty Southerners but the people who come here for the conferences. Yet millions still come here for pleasure and the Illuminations. Amazingly, the people who live here love their monstrous pile. They don't like to hear it knocked.</p> <p>It would be a grave disappointment to discover a tolerable hotel, consume a passable meal or encounter prompt service. The incomprehension with which complaints are received becomes, after a while, positively endearing. How they hate us for our unreasonable demands for ice, bathrooms and telephones in the bedrooms. Who do we think we are? Staying in Blackpool is a kind of psycho-drama, a symbolic fight for existence in a desert of pleasure and plenty.</p> <p>Churchill would never stay in the place, the nearest he ventured was to Lytham. Mr Heath, man of the people, roughs it at the Imperial. Blackpool is the nearest a lot of us get to experience the hardships and deprivations of working-class life. People enjoy Blackpool like they used to enjoy the blitz. In Blackpool you can take it, form cheerful queues and come smiling through the shortages. \"Don't you know there's a Conference on?\" people ask with the disapproving fatalism of \"Don't you know there's a war on?\"</p> <p>They're resourceful, Blackpool people. Last week gales blew up and it became extremely hazardous to enter or leave the hotels. At once a porter took charge. Guests waited in the hall until there were a sufficient number wishing to leave, say five or six. Then he ushered them into an airlock compartment between inner and outer doors whence they made their exit. The procedure was similar to escaping from a submarine.</p> <p>Blackpool begins at Euston, Calais of the North. There is no more hazardous journey to be made by British Rail. The train ran on time for Mr Heath but Mr Wilson was not always so lucky. There was the famous occasion when, in the course of pointing out the landmarks of his \"New Britain\" to Mr Erlander, the then Prime Minister of Sweden, the train stopped, after a delay progressed slowly backwards, proceeded by a long circular diversion, and arrived an hour and a half or so late.</p> <p>Oh Blackpool, my Blackpool.

  "<p>The EU yesterday moved to export its controls on illegal immigration for the first time by setting up a new office in Africa, the first of several it plans to open to try to deal at source with a flood of migration.</p> <p>Louis Michel, the EU's development commissioner, went to Bamako, the capital of Mali, one of the world's poorest countries, to open the Migration Management Centre and inaugurate a pilot scheme to try to dissuade Africans from taking the hazardous routes to Europe.</p> <p>\"This centre paves the way for managing migration flows more effectively,\" said Michel. \"Instead of demonising the migration phenomenon, it should be supported, structured and managed optimally.\"</p> <p>Mali is a hub for tens of thousands of Africans who try to get to Europe illegally every year by embarking on boats to Spain's Canary Islands from the west coast of Africa. Many of them die en route.</p> <p>Last week Spanish coastguards rescued a group of 230 Africans - the largest single boat load of illegal immigrants to reach Spain.</p> <p>Mali is the world's fifth poorest country and an estimated 4m of its 12m population are abroad.</p> <p>As well as seeking to stem illegal migration to the EU, the new Bamako centre is also to act as a reception point for illegal immigrants who have returned or been deported to Africa, as well as acting as a clearing house for legal migrants.</p> <p>The aim is that individual EU countries, for example France and Spain, will use the centre to offer seasonal work for temporary legal migrants. The commission hopes the Mali project will be the first of a network of European migration centres across west Africa. But aid workers and NGOs are sceptical that African expectations of job offers and recruitment centres will be met.</p> <p>The Association of Malian Deportees, which operates as an aid organisation for returned immigrants, complained that the new centre was being established simply to strengthen the EU borders against illegal immigration and to facilitate the more efficient expulsion of immigrants from Europe.</p> <p>The new centre is also to act as a transfer point for the remittances of Malians abroad sending money home to their families.</p>",
  "<p>Shares tumbled. Gordon Brown's economic war cabinet met. The Americans injected another dollop of money into the markets. Iceland was going bust. Just another day in the life of financial markets, now apparently in a state of permanent crisis.</p> <p>Let me kick off this new daily column, designed to explore ways of getting out of the mess we're in, with three challenges facing policymakers. The first is philosophical: much of the past year has been wasted because finance ministries, central banks and international bureaucracies have clung on to a bankrupt ideology. Now the period of denial is over, and that has at last opened up the possibility of a more vigorous policy response. But there is still a reluctance to see the crisis as an opportunity as well as a threat; to put in place the long-term reforms that will stop the lunatics taking over the asylum again.</p> <p>The second challenge is to get the policy framework right. There is absolutely no point in the state taking a stake in the banks or in buying up their \"toxic waste\" if macroeconomic policy is eye-wateringly tight. Patience with Mervyn King is wearing very thin in Whitehall, not just because of his hardline opposition to cuts in interest rates but over what is seen as a foot-dragging approach to sorting out the banking system. </p> <p>Alistair Darling is now not even bothering to disguise his view that it is time for the Bank of England to cut interest rates, and if it doesn't ease policy by half a point this Thursday there will be demands for the chancellor to run monetary policy himself. Rightly so. The only thing that matters in wartime is winning the war. Britain is not alone in suffering from a lack of policy co-ordination; the fact that Angela Merkel announced Germany's go-it-alone guarantee for savers, just hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's summit ended with a declaration of European unity of purpose, is indicative of a wider malaise. Finance has gone global but governance has not.</p> <p>Finally, policymakers need to draw up a \"to do\" list. They have to get ahead of the game. For 14 months they have been reacting to events, with disastrous consequences. Sorting out the banks' problems is the first priority, and it was the extreme stresses in the money markets, with the knock-on effects for businesses trying to raise capital, that spooked the Treasury at the end of last week. There should be a blanket guarantee to all depositors and a commitment to use taxpayers' money to recapitalise strategically important banks. The support should come at a price: root and branch reform of the way banks operate.</p> <p>A bail-out for the banks should be accompanied by a coordinated easing of policy to inject confidence into both financial and consumer markets. Finally, this weekend's meeting of the IMF and World Bank in Washington should be used to sketch out a new international financial architecture. Robert Zoellick, the World Bank's president, made a contribution to this debate yesterday when he called for the anachronistic G7 to be expanded to include seven leading developing countries. That would be sensible, as would toughening up credit rating agency rules and a general beefing-up of the IMF's early warning role in spotting crises.</p> <p>This list does, however, contain one crucial omission - the role of tax havens in undermining the policies of sovereign states. As Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network noted yesterday, tax havens provide a \"get-out-of-regulation free\" card for banks faced with tougher sanctions. This card needs to be taken off the table - but to do so will require the sort of global policy coordination so sorely lacking in recent years.</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott and Will Hutton will analyse the latest developments in the financial crisis every Tuesday to Friday for the coming weeks <a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>England's World Cup fate is already written in the stars,\" David Davies says. He spreads his arms wide in a theatrical flourish and rolls his eyes to the heavens. \"You can see it already. We'll be out in South Africa in 2010 and, in the quarter-finals no doubt, it will be Mexico against England. My good friend Sven-Goran Eriksson will smile phlegmatically while the rest of us howl helplessly as it ends in a penalty shoot-out. It's a cast-iron certainty.\" </p> <p>Davies gives a short bark of incredulous laughter before, in his amusing way, his prediction takes us back to a story from his surreal past at the Football Association, where he eventually ended up as executive director. The anecdote follows Eriksson and Davies as they gatecrash yet another hen party before he returns to the present and fond speculation as to what his Swedish pal might be up to in his new role as the manager of Mexico.</p> <p>This is how a couple of hours pass in Davies's garrulous company. Memories of mishap and scandal, hubris and anguish spill from his dozen years at the muddled heart of English football. His new book, FA Confidential: Sex, Drugs and Penalties, provides an insider's account of a bizarre culture of mismanagement. Davies was propelled up and down the roller coaster of the English game so often that he still sounds positively giddy when recounting the absurdity of it all.</p> <p>Davies, of course, was reduced to locking himself and Kevin Keegan into a toilet cubicle at Wembley, to plead with the then England manager not to resign after humiliation against Germany in 2000. He had lost his previous England manager after Glenn Hoddle, babbling about reincarnation, suggested that disabled people were paying the price for the sins of their previous lives. In recent years he endured revelations that his personal assistant, Faria Alam, had conducted simultaneous affairs with England's latest manager, Eriksson, and Mark Palios, Davies's boss at the FA. Davies was then accused, falsely, by Alam of sexual harassment.</p> <p>During quieter times at Soho Square Davies dealt with Tony Adams and Paul Gascoigne's battles with the bottle, the England squad's threat to strike after Rio Ferdinand was banned for missing a drugs test, George Graham's bungs and Eric Cantona attacking an abusive Crystal Palace supporter with a kung-fu kick to the chest.</p> <p>The madness leads to humour; and an interview with Davies is heavily seasoned with comic bewilderment. The infamous Cantona episode provides a typical example. \"There we were at Cantona's disciplinary hearing,\" Davies chortles, \"and Maurice Watkins, defending Eric as United's lawyer, made an eloquent plea of 'guilty with mitigation'. I'd heard the story about how, in front of a French disciplinary committee, Cantona smacked an official. So when Geoff Thompson, our disciplinary chairman, said, 'We haven't heard from Mr Cantona,' I expected fireworks. Eric began with great dignity: 'I would like to thank the chairman, I would like to thank Manchester United, I would like to thank Mr Ferguson, I would like to thank the prostitute with whom I slept last night, I would like to thank...'</p> <p>\"As he rambled on I looked at the expression on Maurice's face and I knew my ears weren't deceiving me. That was a great Cantona moment and the precursor to his famous 'When the seagulls follow the trawler' speech. I adapted that saying as a mantra for myself at the FA: 'When the seagulls follow the trawler, why do they always shit on me?'\"</p> <p>Those mythical seagulls dumped on Davies most embarrassingly when he was tagged \"The Third Man\" in a supposed triangle of middle-aged men having sex with Ms Alam. For once the laughter curdles and Davies reveals how his reputation, both as a former BBC journalist and as one of the more sane FA members, was briefly shredded by Alam's allegations of harassment.</p> <p>\"It took nine months to clear my name and it was a nightmare. In these cases it's usually one person's word against another but there was so much evidence against Faria that, in the end, the truth emerged so decisively in my favour I could not have written it more forcefully myself. But it scarred me. I bore the brunt of Faria's deception and after 12 years I thought the FA would defend me. They left me high and dry.</p> <p>\"But none of this was Sven's fault. He was great fun and there were some illuminating moments when he admitted being surprised that this bloke from Torsby in Sweden ended up where he did. But Sven is intriguing. At coaching conventions [Raymond] Domenech and [J\u00fcrgen] Klinsmann would go crazy when they saw Sven. Domenech would say, 'God has arrived!'\"</p> <p>Davies waxes further about Eriksson before, suddenly, he stops himself with another joke. \"I must confirm that Sven and I did not sleep together. However, he did sleep in the Queen's bed at Hillsborough Castle. We went up for George Best's funeral and Peter Hain suggested we stay with him at Hillsborough. We got there before Peter arrived and walked down to the nearest pub on a Friday evening. Of course we found another hen party. Sven's capacity to find a restaurant or pub where they were having a hen night was quite ridiculous. We had a great time, with Sven surrounded by women, before returning to the castle where he slept in the Queen's bed - alone, I presume.\"</p> <p>If Eriksson and Terry Venables are the England managers Davies remembers most warmly, he also defends Hoddle and Keegan. \"Glenn was strong tactically and his achievement in Italy [when England secured the draw they needed to qualify for the 1998 World Cup] was exceptional. I think Glenn might figure again as England coach one day.\"</p> <p>If that seems unlikely, at least we know for certain that Keegan won't attempt another crack at international management. His recent travails with Newcastle induce a sympathetic wince from Davies. \"I was surprised Kevin went back to Newcastle but he is such an instinctive person and I just hope he's isn't lost to football now. I did the interview with him on Radio Five when Kevin said he was going to stand by Joey Barton. I thought that was a difficult call and the fractious relationship between him and Mike Ashley simply hardened then.\"</p> <p>Davies is emphatic that, had he remained at the FA after the 2006 World Cup, he would have pushed hard for the appointment of Guus Hiddink. The FA, instead, bungled its pursuit of Luiz Felipe Scolari and ended up with Steve McClaren. Davies suggests that watching England, under McClaren, lose so miserably to Croatia in the final qualification game for Euro 2008 prompted him to write his revelatory book.</p> <p>\"But I like Steve,\" he grins, \"and spoke to him last month.\"</p> <p>Did McClaren talk in his new Dutch accent? \"No,\" Davies laughs. \"I'm not sure what happened to Steve and the accent.\"</p> <p>The fact that McClaren ended up as England manager becomes easier to understand when Davies describes the shambolic FA - filled by men like Geoff Thompson, nicknamed \"Uncle Albert\" or \"Mr Invisible\", and Dave \"The Lollipop Man\" Richards. \"These are not unpleasant nicknames,\" Davies backtracks, \"and the FA has some good people. But English football has had such trouble because it is hopelessly split between the conflicting interests of the Premier League, the FA and the Football League.</p> <p>\"Lord Triesman, the FA's new independent chairman, has a great opportunity to stand above the fighting and force people to work out our agreed priorities. He appears to be working extremely hard for a part-timer but we need a full-time independent chairman who is elected every four years. We need much greater accountability and cohesion.</p> <p>\"We're not doing enough for either England or the clubs. If you set aside last season's Champions League final, Premier League clubs have not been brilliant. Since the Premier League began there have been 14 finals, 28 teams and only four were English. How many English clubs won the Champions League in that time? Two.\"</p> <p>Davies agrees that Richard Scudamore, the Premier League's chief executive, is unlikely to have completely shelved his ridiculed plan to play English club matches abroad. </p> <p>\"I'm less critical of the internationalisation of an already international competition than some and I think Richard will revisit it - if not in the same format. The idea that your club would play 18 teams twice but a 19th side three times just doesn't work. I understood his aim of widening the League's global appeal, but of course it was me who suggested we play an FA Cup final in Paris when Wembley was rebuilt. Not for the first or last time I was in a minority of uno.\"</p> <p>He makes a more serious point in arguing that the \"psychological affliction\" which often takes hold of players in an England shirt is caused less by hysterical media pressure than the conflict between the varying governing bodies. \"When there is no unity off the field it's little wonder we struggle on the pitch. But I did go to the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley and I still hope England might eventually win it again. We need to change the dynamics of conflict - and get lucky.\"</p> <p>That final mention of the World Cup takes us right back to Davies's seer-like certainty of a fateful showdown between England and Mexico in 2010. \"It will happen,\" he chuckles. And then, as if the horror finally strikes him, Davies groans. \"England have gone out of four of their last six major tournaments on penalties. But honestly, if we lose to Mexico on penalties, with Sven smiling sympathetically, I will give up on English football forever.\" </p> <p><em>David Davies's FA Confidential: Sex, Drugs and Penalties is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a317.99)</em></p>",

  "<p>\"Why Has The Word 'Grandmother' Been Banned By The Guardian?\" <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/2189336/why-has-the-word-grandmother-been-banned-by-the-guardian.thtml\">asks Rod Liddle</a> in the Spectator. </p> <p>Great headline \u2013 love all those initial capitals, Rod ... setting exactly the right tone for the tendentious twaddle that followed, accusing us of banning words we haven't banned, for motives that we don't have.</p> <p>The diatribe was prompted by the Guardian Book of English Language, given away free with a recent edition of the newspaper. If you missed it, the book was a condensed version of the style guide used by our journalists, which has long been available to anyone, including Spectator readers, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/styleguide\">access to the world wide web</a>.</p> <p>It contains advice on how to to avoid misusing the apostrophe (\"pea's and bean's\") and similar grammatical and linguistic pitfalls; lists of commonly confused words (forgo or forego?); and factual information that might be of use to writers and editors (what is the Chatham House rule?). There are even a few jokes, if you find the \"heavy metal umlaut\" amusing (which we do).</p> <p>Not much there, you might think, to cause poor Rod's blood pressure to soar off the scale. But \u2013 in common with all media style guides \u2013 we also include some guidelines on writing about potentially tricky areas such as asylum, mental illness, race and so on. And these are what seem to have caused him such angst.</p> <p>I'm not sure, however, if he has actually read the book. It doesn't, for example, ban the word \"grandmother\": what it advises our writers is to mention that someone is a grandparent only when relevant, and to \"leave 'battling grannies' and other examples of ageism and sexism to the tabloids\". Now Rod is entitled to think the Guardian should write about battling grannies, but he extends this to argue, in effect, that we should not be concerned at all with the words we use because to do so removes what he calls the \"implicit or subliminal connotations\" of language and makes the paper \"far less colourful\".</p> <p>There follows a list of words that the Guardian avoids, apparently to Rod's chagrin, such as \"active homosexual\", \"career women\", \"committed suicide\", \"crippled\", \"handicapped\", \"hare lip\", \"Siamese twins\", \"spinster\", and others, including \"illegal asylum seeker\" (a term the normally placid <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/\">Press Complaints Commission</a> ruled in breach of its code of practice).</p> <p>The logic of this argument is that we should still be writing about mongols, nutters, schizos and spastics. I don't doubt that using language that civilised people were finding offensive or outdated 50 years ago would make life more \"colourful\". You could say the same of cockfighting and public executions ... which brings me to Rod's followers, bless them.</p> <p>The comments from some Spectator readers at the end of the piece reveal a hatred of the Guardian out of all proportion to the debate. These people make Sarah Palin look like a liberal wimp. The Guardian is a nest of \"Marxists, deconstructing the English language, as well as the rest of our culture\". We are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Truth\">Orwell's Ministry of Truth</a>.

  "<p>Nearly a quarter of the world's land mammal species are at risk of extinction, and many others may vanish before they are even known to science, according to a major annual survey of global wildlife.</p> <p>At least 1,141 of the 5,487 known species of mammal are threatened, with 188 listed in the highest risk \"critically endangered\" category. One in three marine mammals are also threatened, according to the five year review. </p> <p>The \"red list\" assessment, conducted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), involved more than 1,700 experts in 130 countries, and confirms the devastating impact of forest clearing, hunting, fisheries, pollution and climate change on the populations and ranges of the world's most studied class of animals.</p> <p>Jan Schipper, the director of the global mammals assessment, a partnership between Conservation International and the IUCN, called for countries to be held responsible for the fate of fauna within their borders and the establishment of an international coalition to save species that cross national boundaries.</p> <p>\"We're looking at a 25% decline over the long term, yet for mammals there is no bail out plan. There is no long term conservation strategy that is going to prevent species extinction in the future,\" he said.</p> <p>\"As human beings, we should be ensuring that we don't cause other species to go extinct.\"</p> <p>Disturbingly, the figures are likely to be a conservative estimate, because scientists have insufficient data on 836 species to even classify how threatened they are. If these are all at risk, it would mean 36% of the world's mammal species are in danger of becoming extinct.</p> <p>Among the critically endangered species is the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), with only 84 to 143 adults remaining. Experts believe 29 others may already have become extinct, including the Baiji or Yangtze river dolphin, and the little Earth hutia, a small rodent endemic to islands off Cuba, which has not been seen in nearly 40 years. Two species, the Scimitar-horned oryx and P\u00e8re David's deer are extinct in the wild, and only live on in captivity.</p> <p>Many species, such as the grey wolf and brown bear, have experienced substantial population declines and seen their ranges contract as their natural habitats have been destroyed. More than half of the world's mammal species for which trends are known are in decline, the report found.</p> <p>\"We are getting far too used to seeing these reports bemoaning the fate of the planet or the decline of animals. I am really concerned that we have become deadened to this sort of depressing information and now simply ignore it without stopping to think about the implications,\" said Mark Wright, chief scientist at WWF. </p> <p>\"The IUCN report shows that, with our ill-considered management of the Earth and its resources, we are threatening the future of wildlife and nature and denying our children the chance to experience what we have experienced.\"</p> <p>The survey, which is published by the journal Science today, identifies extinction hotspots where vast numbers of species are under threat. Typically, these are regions with a rich diversity of species that all face a similar threat to their environment. </p> <p>Threatened land mammals are concentrated in south and south-east Asia. There, a staggering 79% of monkeys and apes face extinction. Other hotspots include the tropical Andes, the Cameroonian highlands, the Albertine rift and the Western Ghats in India.</p> <p>\"Often, there is habitat loss from deforestation, either for farming or timber, and that leaves the animals living on small patches of land. Then, on top of that, you have hunting, with an enormous number of people who are entirely reliant on natural resources to feed themselves. That has really set up a perfect storm over south-east Asia,\" said Schipper.</p> <p>The greatest threats to marine mammals are being caught in fishing nets or being struck by shipping vessels, although for the Yangtze river dolphin, pollution is a major contributor. </p> <p>Climate change is already having an impact on amphibians and plant life, but it is expected to put increasing pressure on mammals too, either by destroying their environment, such as the Arctic ice sheets that are home to polar bears, or by forcing their prey elsewhere.</p> <p>Among the most threatened mammals are those only recently discovered. Since 1992, 349 new mammal species have been identified, but 51% of these face extinction, compared with 23% of species known prior to 1992. \"Species may be vanishing even before they are known to science,\" the scientists write in the journal.</p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope among the bleak assessment. At least 5% of the currently threatened species now have stable or rising populations, many of which are the focus of huge conservation efforts. Populations of the European bison and black-footed ferret are both recovering. </p> <p>\"The problem we face is that without the political and public will to spend money on species conservation we are pressed up against the wall,\" said Schipper. \"By making this data public, we're hoping it'll reach the people who make decisions about where money is spent.\"</p>",
  "<p>JJ Abrams has some serious air travel issues. In 2004 the Lost creator spilled befuddled flyers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/aug/06/tvandradio.guide3\">onto a growling desert island</a>. Now he's executive produced Fringe, which debuted last night on Sky One and opened with yet more in-flight horror: passengers en route to Boston are inconvenienced when their faces suddenly and unexpectedly melt. There's not even time to catch the head-soup in a sick bag.</p> <p>It was Munch's Scream in stereo. Brilliant, I thought. This $10m, 95-minute pilot is the X-Files (before it disappeared up an alien's bottom) reborn. Sadly, though, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RCI8D8avGI&amp;feature=related\">post face-melting</a>, the super-size pilot was a super-snore. Meet the Zzz-Files - formulaic, flabby and flat.</p> <p>In the forced first half an hour, FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) teams up with recovering-loon scientist, Walter Bishop (John Noble) and his estranged genius son, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-6nAjC9kdM\">Peter (Joshua Jackson)</a>. Together they investigate \"fringe\" science, starting with the weird chemical that turns frequent flyers' flesh into beef dripping.</p> <p>The best X-Files episodes, you'll remember, dealt with stand-alone freaks and gave the props department something exciting to do with their bulk-bought ooze. Noting the winning formula, the Fringe gang have gone all out on gore. But they forgot to add in suspense and the kind of vertebrae-penetrating doom that haunted those eerie early Files. Fringe never sits still long enough to develop an idea or build tension. Characters simply take turns spitting unimaginatively fraught lines.</p> <p>The dreary dialogue is made more unbearable by botched casting. Little Joshua Jackson (Pacey from Dawson's Creek) is offered up as Mulder mark II. They've tried to butch him up with stubble and an unsavoury past, but it's not enough. Meanwhile, generic girl FBI agent is bland, blonde and forgettable. Olivia, was it? The casting director must have been in the loo when Jackson and Torv read together. I can't think of any other reason for hiring potential love-buddies with sub-zero chemistry.</p> <p>Of the three principals, the only one I'd consider letting back on my screen is the nutso scientist dad. When we first meet senile Bishop Snr he's in an asylum, alternately spouting smarts and weeing himself. But team-Fringe don't want a dribbling coot on their books, so he's swiftly de-bonkered. It's a huge mistake. Sane, he loses nine-tenths of his charm.</p> <p>The only respite from the demented pace, disastrous cast and yawnsome script is a scene-stealing cow. She's brought in for some light animal testing and succeeds in jollying up Bishop Snr's dusty old laboratory - and the show. Two or three bovine gags crept in and stopped me from spontaneously comatosing.</p> <p>Want my advice, Sky One? Cut the Fringe.</p>",
  "<p>Here at RealClimate we understandably have an intense interest in the positions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates regarding global warming and carbon emissions. What the stance bodes for future action on climate change is consequential in itself, but beyond that the ability to use sound science in this case serves as a bellweather for the candidates' whole approach to science. Whatever else you can say about the candidates, it has been encouraging that both John McCain and Barack Obama favour mandatory action to reduce US carbon emissions.</p> <p>But, enter governor Sarah Palin, McCain's pick for VP. Palin's position on global warming has been stated quite clearly <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/sarah_palin_vp/2008/08/29/126139.html\">in this recent interview with the publication Newsmax</a>, where she says: \"A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made.\" How is this to be reconciled with McCain's position? Do they just agree to differ? What does this bode for future actions if McCain were to win the election, especially in view of the fact that, in a Cheney-esque way, Palin is likely to be put in charge of energy policy? The recent vice-presidential debate sheds some light on the issue. A <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/03/america/03debate-transcript.php\">full transcript of the debate is here</a>.</p> <p>Palin seems to be attempting to defuse the whole issue by claiming the cause doesn't matter. When the moderator asked her: \"What is true and what is false about what we have heard, read, discussed, debated about the causes of climate change,\" Palin responded as follows:</p> <p>\"PALIN: Yes. Well, as the nation's only Arctic state and being the governor of that state, Alaska feels and sees impacts of climate change more so than any other state. And we know that it's real.</p> <p>\"I'm not one to attribute every man \u2014 activity of man to the changes in the climate. There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet.\"</p> <p>I'm pretty sure that that last statement is a garbled attempt to reiterate what she said in the Newsmax interview, but you be the judge. Unlike the previous quote, this one at least has a nod in the direction of acknowledging (tentatively) the possibility of a human influence. What's important is what comes next:</p> <p>\"But there are real changes going on in our climate. And I don't want to argue about the causes. What I want to argue about is, how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts?\"</p> <p>Dare we say that it, in fact, very much makes a difference what is causing global warming? If CO2 really weren't a major part of the cause, what in the world would be the point of John McCain's (or anybody's) stated policy of acting to reduce emissions? And even if you were of the school that says adaptation is better than mitigation, knowing the cause is an important part of knowing what kind of climate change you have to adapt to, how long it is likely to last, and how much worse it is likely to get in the future.</p> <p>Biden's answer, by comparison, was direct, straightforward, and simple:</p> <p>\"BIDEN: Well, I think it is manmade. I think it's clearly manmade. And, look, this probably explains the biggest fundamental difference between John McCain and Barack Obama and Sarah Palin and Joe Biden \u2014 Governor Palin and Joe Biden.</p> <p>If you don't understand what the cause is, it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution. We know what the cause is. The cause is manmade. That's the cause. That's why the polar icecap is melting.\"</p> <p>Well, maybe he left out the kind of caveats and qualifications you'd attach to the attribution of the recent loss of (North) polar sea ice if this were an AGU talk instead of a vice-presidential debate. Overall,though, the statement gets to the heart of the matter.</p> <p>One can moreover doubt even Palin's commitment to dealing with the consequences of climate change. Surely, that would include doing something to save the polar bears,yet the State of Alaska (against the advice of its own wildlife biologists) is suing the Interior department over its decision to list the polar bear as \"threatened\" \u2014 and this despite the fact that the Bush administration put so many qualifications on the listing as to make it essentially toothless. What's even more telling is that the brief submitted to Interior drew heavily on a list of climate skeptics (including the Marshall Institute's Willie Soon) that could easily have been culled from the infamous Inhofe 400. (See this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/01/sarahpalin.climatechange\">theguardian.com/environment article</a>). Palin's role in bringing this case has not been peripheral; she has been very much at the center of the effort, and has consistently questioned the causal link between CO2 and global warming in making the case. As early as December 2006, she wrote to Secretary Kempthorne: \"\"When a species' habitat (in this case, sea ice) is declining due to climate change, but there are no discrete human activities that can be regulated or modified to effect change, what do you do?\" Further information about Palin's long fight against the listing, and her view of the scientific issues involved, can be found <a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/public/Content/article.aspx?RsrcID=34907\">here</a>.</p> <p>We will take this occasion to note also that Biden used the debate to reaffirm Obama's long standing position in favor of \"clean coal.\" Whether this is a good or bad thing depends on the extent to which the candidates understand what should really be meant by this term. From the point of view of global warming, the only \"clean\" coal would be coal burned with 100% carbon capture and sequestration \u2014 certainly worthy of research and pilot implementation, but not by any means a technology that can be counted on at present to solve the problem. (And of course, the term \"clean\" is even then relative, since what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaintop_removal_mining\">mountain top removal mining</a> does to the West Virginia hills and rivers is anything but \"clean\").</p> <p>So there you are.

  "<p>With a month to go before election day, the McCain campaign took a sharp turn towards the negative over the weekend - and Sarah Palin was in the vanguard. </p> <p>At three different events in California on Saturday, Palin attacked Obama's associations with Bill Ayers, the former Weather Underground member, accusing the Democratic candidate of \"palling around with terrorists\".</p> <p>The attacks drew a sharp response from Obama, who made much of a remark by a McCain adviser, published in the Washington Post, that his campaign was \"looking forward to turning the page on this financial crisis\". </p> <p>\"They plan to - and I quote - 'turn the page' on the discussion about our economy and spend the final weeks of this campaign launching Swift Boat-style attacks on me,\" Obama told a crowd in North Carolina, in a speech backed up by a new TV ad. \"We are facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and John McCain wants us to 'turn the page' on talking about the economy?\"</p> <p>Democratic surrogates also said the Obama campaign had given them the go-ahead to start mentioning some of McCain's questionable associations, including his involvement in the Keating Five scandal and his connections to the ultraconservative Council for World Freedom.</p> <p>The new negativity from the McCain campaign is a response to continuing bad news for the Republicans in the opinion polls: a New York Times analysis at the weekend noted that Obama is now seriously competitive in nine states that voted for Bush in 2004, while McCain is competitive in only four that voted for Kerry.</p> <p>Obama's associations with Ayers hardly justify the phrase \"palling around\": they served on a charity board together, and Ayers once hosted a political event for Obama early in his career. And Obama has repudiated Ayers's 1960s radicalism. But the question that seems likely to be most pressing in the coming week is not whether the Palin-led attacks are fair: it's whether they will work.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama has no public events scheduled for today. Joe Biden has cancelled his appearances for Monday and Tuesday after the death of his mother-in-law on Sunday. McCain is campaigning in New Mexico and Tennessee; Palin is in Florida. </p> <p>Tomorrow night, Obama and McCain will return to the limelight, nudging Palin aside, as they appear for the second presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee, in a \"town hall meeting\", taking questions from the audience. It's McCain's favourite format.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Gallup's latest daily tracking poll, released yesterday, gave Obama a seven-point lead, at 50%, over McCain's 43%. It was the ninth straight day that the Democrat had had a statistically significant lead.

  "<p>Environmental campaigners have attacked Starbucks after the discovery that millions of litres of water are wasted in its coffee shops every day, contradicting its much-boasted green credentials.</p> <p>An investigation by <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1771553.ece\">the Sun</a> revealed that over 23.4m litres of water are poured down the drains of 10,000 outlets worldwide due to a policy of keeping a tap running non-stop.</p> <p>It is enough daily water for the entire 2 million population of Namibia in Africa, which has severe droughts, or to fill an Olympic pool every 83 minutes.</p> <p>A single Starbucks tap left running for just over three minutes wastes the amount of water one African needs to survive for a day in drought conditions.</p> <p>Each Starbucks has a cold tap behind the counter that runs into a sink known as a \"dipper well\" - used to wash utensils.</p> <p>Under the company's health and safety rules, staff are banned from turning the water off because management claim that a constant flow of water prevents germs breeding in taps.</p> <p>Water companies joined green activists in criticising the firm for harming the environment and wasting a vital natural resource. Experts said leaving taps running for hygiene reasons was \"nonsense\".</p> <p>Water shortage is one of the world's biggest problems. Australia is in the grip of a seven-year drought - the worst in a century.</p> <p>In the UK, Starbucks has 698 branches, each open for 13 hours a day. Even a slow tap flows three litres of water a minute, meaning Starbucks in the UK is wasting an estimated 1.63m litres a day \u2013 enough to supply Matlock village in Derbyshire.</p> <p>The running water policy was revealed after a Starbucks executive wrote back to a couple who complained about the tap at their local branch.</p> <p>Lisa Woolfe, 39, of Cuffley, Hertfordshire, said: \"I noticed a small sink behind the counter had its tap running. The assistant said the store was told to keep it running as it cleaned the pipes.</p> <p>\"I could not believe it but when we contacted head office, they confirmed the taps were left on and the water was not recycled.</p> <p>\"It is an absolutely astonishing waste of water, especially for a company which prides itself on its green credentials.\"</p> <p>Speaking to staff at Starbucks outlets around the world, the Sun found that many did not use the running tap or even know what it was for.</p> <p>Peter Robinson, of the environmental charity Waste Watch, said: \"Leaving taps running all day is a shocking waste of precious water. And to claim you are doing it for health and safety reasons is bonkers.</p> <p>\"Tap water comes from rivers and groundwater and wasting it can cause great harm to the environment and wildlife. Big companies should set an example.\"</p> <p>Jacob Tompkins, of the independent water efficiency agency Water Wise, said: \"If they are doing all their basic cleaning procedures, I fail to see why they would need to do this. There are a lot of other ways to stop a build-up of bacteria.</p> <p>\"The chance of a build-up in the spout is extremely remote. And if there is one they're not cleaning the tap properly.\"</p> <p>Ian Barker, the head of water resources at the Environment Agency, said: \"We are already taking too much water from the environment and are seeing reduced river flows.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Starbucks said that the company's water use adhered to the World Health Organisation, US and EU environmental directives for in-store water supply standards. But she acknowledged the company could cut its water use.</p> <p>She defended its dipper well system, saying the technique was common and accepted in the industry.</p> <p>\"Starbucks' challenge is to balance water conservation with the need for customer safety,\" the spokeswoman said. \"The dipper well system currently in use in Starbucks retail stores ensures that we meet or exceed our own and local health standards.\"<br> She said the company had tested alternative methods such as the use of an ice bath but it was not successful. It was considering other alternatives and cut its water use per square foot this year. </p> <p>Starbucks is known for its campaigns and instore advertising boasting how it gives back to communities and the environment.</p> <p>In the company's latest corporate social responsibility report, it says: \"From promoting conservation in coffee-growing countries to in-store 'green teams' and recycling programs, Starbucks has established high standards for environmental responsibility.</p> <p>\"By taking steps to reduce waste from our operations and recycle, we can preserve the Earth's natural resources and enhance the quality of lives around the globe.</p> <p>\"Starbucks actively seeks opportunities to minimise our environmental impact.\"</p> <p>This is not the first time the Seattle-based firm has come under fire over its social and environmental credentials. In 2006, the Guardian reported how the US coffee giant has used its muscle to block an attempt by Ethiopia's farmers to copyright their most famous coffee bean types, denying them potential earnings of up to \u00a347m a year.</p> <p>As a result, Starbucks negotiated an agreement with the Ethiopian government to give the country more ownership and a better price for its coffee beans.</p>",
  "<p>Death records are to be released for the first time in a bid to stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/identityfraud\">fraudsters stealing the identity</a> of the deceased, the government announced today.</p> <p>Each week, vetted organisations including credit reference agencies will be sent encrypted files containing details of everyone who has died in the UK.</p> <p>The move is aimed at reducing fraud by criminals who use obituaries and other information to build up an identity to open bank accounts, commit benefit fraud or aid illegal immigration.</p> <p>In one case that came to court last month, a 39-year-old Edinburgh man admitted to stealing the identity of a dead child to open a bank account and obtain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/creditcards\">credit cards</a>. Over three years more than \u00a3200,000 passed through the account.</p> <p>This type of crime can be devastating for relatives of the deceased who have to deal with the consequences, as well as having a knock-on affect on legitimate borrowers as banks raise costs to recoup their losses. </p> <p>Around 12,000 records a week will be made available by the General Register Office for England &amp; Wales, and its Scottish and Northern Irish counterparts.</p> <p>They will go to credit checking firms who have applied to receive the information under the initiative.</p> <p>The announcement comes at the start of National Identity Fraud Prevention Week, a government-backed awareness drive to warn of the risks of ID fraud.</p> <p>Figures suggest that the cost of the crime to the UK is in the region of \u00a31.7bn every year. The UK's Fraud Prevention Service, Cifas, said that last year alone its members had identified 65,043 victims.</p> <p>\"Identity fraud continues to be a serious problem which we know helps enable other criminal activity such as benefit fraud, illegal immigration, illegal working, drug trafficking and terrorism,\" said Meg Hillier, the Home Office minister with responsibility for identity fraud.</p> <p>Peter Hurst, chief executive of Cifas, said there were still far too many people falling victim to ID fraud.</p> <p>\"Identity fraud is serious, and no-one should be complacent about it,\" he said. \"Quite apart from financial losses, the effect on victims can be very distressing. Where a victim's identity has been seriously compromised it can be an extremely time-consuming and frustrating process to untangle the threads of deception.</p>",
  "<p>October is traditionally a month when gory movies top the US box office, but a different type of horror invaded the hearts of American filmgoers this weekend. The Disney family feature <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/23/comedy\">Beverly Hills Chihuahua</a> was top dog, yapping all the way to the bank with an <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117993455.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">opening haul of $29m</a> (\u00a316.5m). The film centres on a ritzy LA pooch trying to get home after getting lost on holiday in Mexico.</p> <p>The film kicked Eagle Eye off its No 1 perch; the Shia La Beouf thriller dropped to second place with a decent $17.7m in its second week. Third spot went to Juno-esque teen comedy Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, starring Superbad's Michael Cera and Kat Dennings. It made $12m on debut.</p> <p>The top five was rounded out by the previously released romantic drama Nights in Rodanthe, with Richard Gere and Diane Lane, which made $7.3m in its second week, and the western Appaloosa, starring Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen, which made $5m in its third week.</p> <p>Further down the chart two films with very different agendas battled it out for No 9 and 10 slots, with rightwing polemic An American Carol just beating God-bashing documentary Religulous. The former made $3.8m, with the latter just behind on $3.5m. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126192/american.carol\">An American Carol</a> features a Michael Moore-type character who is chastised for his anti-American ways by various spirits of US patriots. Religulous sees comic Bill Maher travel across the world lampooning various God-fearing types. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/oct/02/dark.knight.blindness\">planned protests against Fernando Meirelles' Blindness</a> by groups representing blind people may have helped keep the film out of the top 10. Despite the presence of Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo, the thriller, which centres on a woman who has retained her sight in a society of people stricken by a disease which has stolen theirs, finished outside the top 10 with just $2m on debut.</p>",
  "<h2>The Film</h2> <p>During the 1960s and 1970s Arthur Penn made a series of films that uncompromisingly engaged with the reality of America's violent past. Penn re-invented the gangster genre with Bonnie and Clyde (1967), a film that re-cast the main protagonists as lovers-on-the-run, in French nouvelle vague style.</p> <p>Penn's directorial career began with The Left Handed Gun (1958). This was a western story that looked at one of the most compelling stories of the old west \u2013 the legend of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. The film stars Paul Newman in the role of Billy, with John Dehner as Pat.</p> <p>The film was an attempt by Penn to unpick the romanticised mythology of the west in Hollywood. The revisionist western of the 1960s and 1970s accepted the arbitrary violence of the wild-west as a product of social, political and economic forces beyond the control or understanding of its cast. Accordingly, the new heroes were presented as composite characters with both good and evil in their natures. Left Handed Gun was originally conceived as a vehicle for James Dean, the poster boy of American teenage anxiety and rebellion during the 1950s.</p> <p>The revisionist western is, at its most accomplished, a proto-Marxist exposition of the determining forces that shaped the westward American expansion. The genre also includes Once Upon a Time in the West from 1968, and Heaven's Gate (1980). These films refuse the complacent moral judgements used to justify the manifest destiny of western expansion.</p> <p>Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kidd (1973), with Kris Kristofferson, James Coburn and Bob Dylan was part of a slightly different effort. Peckinpah's project, begun with Ride the High Country (1962) and The Wild Bunch (1969), sought to make a definitive statement about the American west. For Peckinpah, the isolation of the far west removed all but the most basic of determining forces. The result was an unforgiving environment that revealed the moral integrity, or otherwise, of the men and women placed within it. For Peckinpah, failure was always met with a bullet. More recently, Clint Eastwood has explored this version of the west.</p> <h2>The Legend of Pat and Billy</h2> <p>The legend plays itself out against a backdrop of the small, but intensely violent, Lincoln County wars. This conflict pitched the vested interests of ranchers against those of the wider community. The war ranged across New Mexico in America's southwest during 1878.</p> <p>Billy the Kid was a member of the ranchers' outlaw force, named The Regulators. These enforcers, drawn from criminal elements across the southwest, eventually ran out of control. They were brutally suppressed in a series of bloody shoot-outs. Those that survived were dispersed and forced on the run. The implacable law-man Pat Garrett, eventually tracked, caught and executed Billy in 1881.</p> <p>The legend of Pat and Billy was mostly created through the sensationalist memoir published by Pat Garrett in 1882. The myth showed Garrett as an enforcer who would follow his prey to the inevitable and bloody conclusion. This myth has been variously recast across American history and in various contexts, so that corruption and lawlessness will never, in the USA, be allowed to go unpunished.</p> <p>Billy the Kid, like Jesse James, is one of the hero villains of the wild-west. His reputation as a violent killer was tempered by recollections of his friendly and personable character. Surviving photographs of Billy show his appreciation of fine clothes. He was remembered as a neat dresser who favoured an unadorned Mexican sombrero hat. So, Billy survives as both outlaw and folk hero dandy.</p> <p>The attempt, by revisionist Hollywood, to rehabilitate the western outlaw reached its apotheosis in George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).</p> <h2>The Poster</h2> <p>This week's poster is a piece of ephemera from the Royal College of Art in London. The poster is a simple, rough-and-ready, example of student design and screen-printing.</p> <p>The design of the poster, narrow portrait, allowed it to be printed two-up on double crown paper measuring 20x30 inches. The poster was printed in a tiny print run for display within the College. The make-ready for screen-printing would have taken a few hours using new photo-mechanical processes.</p> <p>The poster design is made up of several pictorial elements. These are the map of the USA, the lawman's stripes and the revolver. The map is embellished with a line of letterpress printing, The Western Plains. This second printing, combining two quite separate forms of printmaking would only have been possible within the non-commercial environment of the RCA.</p> <p>The success, or otherwise, of poster designs at the RCA could always be judged by how many were removed from the walls and how quickly. John Lewis, typographer at the RCA, saved this example.</p> <h2>The RCA</h2> <p>The Royal College of Art played a key role in the transformations of British visual culture during the 1960s. The first generation of post-war designers rejected the sense of established good taste prevailing in Britain at the end of the 1950s. The use of irregular typography, the general references to popular culture, and to American popular culture in particular, were strategies calculated to wind up the old guard.</p> <p>The conceptualisation of society based around the hedonistic consumerism of experience and lifestyle began in the early 1950s at the ICA in London. The artists and architects associated with the Independent Group rejected established and polite good taste. These artists revelled in the more energetic and visceral possibilities of cultural production.</p> <p>In this context, it was entirely appropriate that the College Film Society should provide screenings of American, rather than of higher-brow, European art-house films.</p> <p>The College magazine Ark provides a more permanent legacy of these ideas. The editors recall that their efforts were an attempt to produce a magazine as part of a visual culture whose experience was immediate and exciting. They rejected the usual idea that the work should be about something beyond itself and the immediate here-and-now.</p> <p>Eventually, these ideas formed the basis of swinging London and its politics of an ephemeral and hedonistic consumption. Later, the same willingness to wind up the establishment formed the basis for the punk counter-culture of the mid 1970s.</p> <p>The designer of the poster remains unknown. Perhaps it was Brian Haynes who later worked at The Sunday Times Magazine. Maybe it was Brian Tattersfield.</p>"
