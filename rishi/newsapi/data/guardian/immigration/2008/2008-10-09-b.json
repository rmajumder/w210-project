  "<p>The cult French writer JMG Le Cl\u00e9zio yesterday won the Nobel prize for literature, lifting Paris out of its depression over the nation's cultural decline.</p> <p>Le Cl\u00e9zio, known as France's \"nomad novelist\", lives mainly in New Mexico in the US, in near seclusion, and is the opposite of Paris's current trend for writers' navel-gazing accounts of their sex lives.</p> <p>The Swedish jury hailed his scathing critiques of urban western civilisation and the \"poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy\" of his stories of native populations in Africa and Latin America. His novels, whose settings range from the Sahara to Mauritius, are expected to see a massive sales boost in Britain, where he is currently out of print and barely known.</p> <p>Le Cl\u00e9zio, 68, last year signed an open letter with other writers appealing for French literature to be more open to the wider world. Last night he batted off talk of French cultural stagnation. \"I deny it,\" he said. \"It's a very rich, very diversified culture. There's no risk of decline.\"</p> <p>In Paris Le Cl\u00e9zio is seen as one of France's greatest living writers. He says his work is defined by his mixed roots. He was born in Nice but most identifies with the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, where his Breton ancestors fled in the 18th century and lived for generations before returning to France.</p> <p>He has joint Mauritian citizenship and calls the island his \"little fatherland\", describing himself an \"exile\" who grew up steeped in its mixed culture and traditions. His father, a Mauritian doctor with British citizenship, moved the family to Nigeria when Le Cl\u00e9zio was a child, before returning to Nice. Le Cl\u00e9zio studied in Britain, taught at universities in the US, Mexico and Thailand and travelled extensively with his Moroccan wife, writing about mixed relationships, and postcolonial and indigenous cultures.</p> <p>Le Cl\u00e9zio, who publishes books at a rate of around one a year, shot to fame in France as a 23-year-old with his first novel, Le Proces-Verbal (The Interrogation), a portrait of a young man's mental illness. It won critical acclaim and a major literary prize, and his looks saw him dubbed French literature's Steve McQueen. Yesterday French media still referred to him as a blue-eyed \"elegant cowboy\".</p> <p>Le Cl\u00e9zio became popular in France in the 1970s and 80s with novels set across the world. His big breakthrough came in 1980 with Desert, an award-winning novel of French colonialism seen through the eyes of a Tuareg woman in the Sahara. Since 2000 he has focused on stories of childhood and post-colonialism, drawing on his own family stories.</p> <p>The Nobel jury said Le Cl\u00e9zio \"stood out as an ecologically engaged author\", citing his novels Terra Amata, The Book of Flights, War and The Giants. They called him an \"explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilisation\".</p> <p>His acceptance speech at the ceremony in December is likely to have a political slant. A defender of Creole writers who face problems getting published, he said yesterday he would use the speech to campaign for the promotion of young writers outside the metropolitan elite. He is also vocal about war, women's rights and child prostitution in the developing world.</p> <p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, said: \"Jean-Marie Le Cl\u00e9zio is a citizen of the world, son of all continents and cultures. A great traveller, he embodies the influence of France, its culture and its values in a globalised world.\"</p> <p>Apart from the 2000 win by the Chinese-born Gao Xingjian, who has French nationality, France has not won a Nobel literature prize for over 20 years and has been desperate for a return to the golden era of winners such as Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Andre Gide.</p> <h2>'A beautiful portrait'</h2> <p>\"This [the portrayal of the protagonist, Ethel] is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful portraits Le Cl\u00e9zio has ever written, flickering, fragile, never closed in on itself, never frozen in marble or gripped in the vice of oppressive psychological certitudes.</p> <p>\"Its autobiographical role has been reduced to the simplest of expressions. So no confusion or confession, just a simple gesture of intimacy... [Le Cl\u00e9zio] does not give any moral lesson. Subtle and generous, but at the same time highly skilful ... his art is all about compassion and empathy - and also rebellion. It is rare to enter with such emotion into the feelings of fictional characters.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Extract from Le Monde review of Le Cl\u00e9zio's latest novel, Ritournelle de la faim (Chorus of Hunger)</p>",
  "<p>The veteran Lancastrian Jim Eyre, who has died aged 83, was a legend in the world of cave exploration. After the second world war he began what became about 50 years of continuous worldwide exploration of limestone caves, becoming internationally respected. He was a character, an organiser, an initiative taker and, above all, an explorer where no one had ventured before. </p> <p>In 1946 in Lancaster, Jim helped to found the Red Rose Cave and Pot Hole Club, which thrives to this day with nearly 200 members. He was prominent in the earliest exploration of the Ease Gill caverns, on the Lancashire-Cumbria border, Britain's longest cave system, now approaching 80km in length and still being extended. </p> <p>He went on to probe whatever was worth doing in the big caves in Europe, particularly in Greece and Spain, and was among the first cavers to venture into Asia, especially India and Iran, with spectacular results, before going on to Mexico and the world's deepest vertical shafts.</p> <p>Jim was also known for his writing, which captured the camaradie of casual bravery typical of an adventure sport with a degree of risk. Two early books, It's Only a Game and The Game Goes On, included more than 160 photographs and cartoons of his characteristically knobbly-kneed explorers. His 1961 autobiography, The Cave Explorers, sold out. </p> <p>Half a dozen other books have followed, including Race Against Time: A History of the Cave Rescue Organisation (1988, co-written with me) about the team based in Clapham, north Yorkshire, who are called out to caving incidents and also used for local mountain rescue.</p> <p>In his heyday, Jim was a sharp-end leader skilled at recovering injured cavers from difficult locations, where sheer determination and constant ingenuity were necessary. In 1967, he led the rescue team in one of the worst of all caving accidents, when six explorers died in Mossdale caverns, beneath the Yorkshire Dales. </p> <p>Born in Kent, Jim moved to Lancaster as a child. He started exploring caves in 1942, shortly before he was put on destroyers and minesweepers in the Royal Navy. By trade a self-employed painter and decorator, he was married twice but had no children. His brother Ron survives him.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Who is he?</strong></p> <p>A Uruguayan director with a troubling resemblance to Michael Bolton circa 1991.</p> <p><strong>He doesn't get in front of the camera though?</strong></p> <p>No. And to be fair we ought to be more troubled by Pl\u00e1's film, La Zona (released here on October 17), which sees mob rule descend on a gated community in a thinly disguised Mexico City. Things go wrong in this eerie world of suburban palaces after three kids from the slums break in and residents mete out their own justice.</p> <p><strong>Not a great advert for the Mexican capital then.</strong></p> <p>No, but in the year since La Zona was at the Venice film festival, warring drug cartels have plunged Mexico into lawlessness.</p> <p><strong>How do the police come off in the film?</strong></p> <p>Venal for the most part - even the maverick cop who refuses to be bribed is brought down by his own record of brutality. And vigilantism tramples the liberal values of the Zone's residents.</p> <p><strong>No happy endings then?</strong></p> <p>Don't bank on any. In places he exercises the kind of remorseless you'd expect from Michael Haneke, thrown in with the visceral, big-issues filmmaking of Mexicans Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (Amores Perros) and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (Children of Men).</p> <p><strong>What next?</strong></p> <p>His second film, The Desert Within, will be shown at the London film festival later this month.</p>",
  "<p>Justin Harrison was an unlikely recruit for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bath\">Bath</a> this season. The veteran Australian second row, who made his name in his first Test for the Wallabies when he stole a late lineout throw from Martin Johnson to seal the 2001 series against the Lions, did not seem, to many outside the Recreation Ground, a ready-made replacement for Steve Borthwick or someone who would fit into the fast, fluent game developed by the club's head coach, Steve Meehan.</p> <p>\"Every team needs players to do the grunt work,\" said the 34-year-old Harrison ahead of his first return to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/toulouse\">Toulouse</a> on Sunday since he played there for Ulster two years ago. In that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/heinekencup\">Heineken Cup</a> encounter the home flanker Trevor Brennan stormed into the crowd to confront a visiting supporter, subsequently earning himself a life ban, before coming on to the field as a replacement and quickly finding himself in the sin-bin with Harrison for fighting.</p> <p>\"The great thing about Bath is that we have players who can play it tight and loose. Take Matt Stevens: he is one of the best tight-head props in the world. He has a fantastic running game, unusual for someone in his position, but he physically dominates opponents and is a very strong scrummager. He has a quiver full of skills and that is what it is all about.\"</p> <p>Harrison will soon find himself partnering Danny Grewcock, a rival on the 2001 Lions tour, when the latter is back to full fitness later this month. Neither player is known for his high tolerance threshold on the field and referees will be checking they have not left their yellow cards in the dressing room. \"It is an easy decision for a referee to show a yellow card to someone who has a certain notoriety and it becomes self-perpetuating,\" said Harrison.</p> <p>\"The referee will earn himself a tick in the box, not criticism, but I guess at our age, 10 minutes off is not all that bad. Grewy and I both play the game as hard as we can and to a level that often draws attention. We are not cheats or dirty and we do not play outside the rules. We just take things to the limit and live on the edge. Daniel's persona is an absolute polar distance to what he is like on the field. He is one of the most caring, considerate and gentle men I have ever met: on the field, if you were not on the same team as him, you would be too fearful to be anywhere in the stadium.\"</p> <p>Harrison signed a one-year contract with Bath having spent three seasons with Ulster and intends to prove himself worthy of an extension. He left Australia in 2004 having won 34 caps, one year after playing against England in the World Cup final in Sydney, and initially missed proving his worth for Test rugby. \"Move from Australia and you are not considered by the Wallabies,\" he said. \"I did not realise how much I would miss the international scene, not the playing in front of big crowds, the money or the recognition, which are mere salad dressing: it was not being able to reach the top of your occupation. But I have readjusted my goals and I relish imparting my experience on a team that is hungry for success.</p> <p>\"There are great similarities between Bath and Belfast: they both totally represent their countries. Before I came to England, I imagined rolling green hills, country pubs, sandstone buildings and long driveways and that is exactly what I have seen. Sport is a conduit for community spirit: Bath and Belfast are both one-team cities and playing in front of a packed Rec is a thrill. The Guinness Premiership offers the best and most competitive rugby in the world. I may be 34, but I feel the best is still to come from me.\"</p> <p>When Harrison woke on the morning of his Test debut seven years ago, he found he had been branded a plank and an ape by one of the Lions squad, Austin Healey. It earned him instant fame here but has he been watching Healey on Strictly Come Dancing? \"I am not interested in watching people learn to dance,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>I'm from Argentina and have just returned from Bolivia and Peru. Rory Carroll (Rampant violence is Latin America's 'worst epidemic', October 9) ignores the main culprits: not criminal gangs, but rightwing governments organised from Washington, which have ruled with impunity.</p> <p>Argentina, like Chile and others, is still recovering from military dictators who disappeared 30,000 people and from the laws which gave them impunity. Most countries have suffered electoral fraud, and the current presidents of both Colombia and Mexico are accused of crimes against humanity. All have been prey to Washington's free-market policies, which caused rampant corruption. </p> <p>Argentina's 2002 meltdown, which left 50% of its population in poverty, should have served as a warning against today's banking crisis.</p> <p>In the past decade, massive social movements have elected popular governments to tackle this legacy of poverty, corruption and impunity. Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela are held back by racist elites which have governed by the gun for 500 years, in the last century with the complicity of the courts and the US embassies.</p> <p>In Bolivia, I interviewed survivors of the recent massacre of small farmers shot and tortured by gangs and police working for Leopoldo Fernandez, the prefect of Pando. Eighteen bodies had been recovered and over 100 were still missing, among them pregnant women and children. Impunity was on everyone's lips: how to prevent judges from releasing Fernandez and the US from offering him asylum, despite overwhelming evidence against him? </p> <p>Impunity has allowed the US to remove a democratically elected government in Haiti and to invade Iraq. It allows banks to steal and be rewarded with public funds. Impunity is what makes the biggest crimes pay. <br><strong>Nina Lopez</strong><br>Global Women's Strike</p>",

  "<p>It wasn't a unanimous rejection, but four Conservative London Assembly members yesterday voted against something Mayor Johnson apparently favours. Of itself, this is encouraging: one of those concerned, the new Tory group leader Roger Evans, wrote recently at Conservative Home, \"Conservative AMs have a key role as critical friends to the Mayor.\" However, your pleasure in this occurrence might be limited depending on your attitude to amnesties for illegal migrants. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release_a.jsp?releaseid=19162\">motion at issue</a> was this: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"This Assembly notes the election commitment given by the current Mayor and other leading contenders in support of a one-off, time-limited, earned regularisation of suitable irregular migrants, many of whom live and work in London, which would allow those who have been in the UK for many years to be admitted to a two-year pathway to citizenship.</p> <p>This Assembly now resolves to make representations to the UK Government in support of such a regularisation, and calls on the Mayor to join it in making these representations, including by commissioning supporting evidence regarding the impact on London from GLA Economics.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Mayor Johnson, you may recall, made his unexpected pledge at the unforgettable London Citizens Accountability Assembly, where candidates were invited by menacing men in dog collars to sign up to a list of desirable goals.

A couple of other Tories left the chamber before the vote and one abstained: Richard Barnes, the statutory deputy mayor. Why was this? Did he feel obliged to stick to Mayor Johnson's line?

  "<p>Tuesday's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/washington/08detain.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">ruling</a> by a US district court judge in Washington <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1008/p99s01-duts.html\">ordering 17 Uighurs released into the US</a> brings us one step closer to righting one of the most egregious wrongs in the catalogue of injustices at Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>The right thing to do about the Guant\u00e1namo Uighurs has been staring the Bush administration in the face for years, but they lacked the courage to do it on their own. They knew very quickly that these men posed no threat to the US, but that they could not be sent back to China, and no country was willing to risk relations with Beijing to solve America's problem. The only viable option was to resettle them in the US, but the Bush administration refused, perhaps hoping to run out the clock and leave this problem for the next administration. So the Uighurs languished at Guant\u00e1namo until Tuesday, no longer enemy combatants, just prisoners of cowardice.</p> <p>The Uighurs are a Muslim ethnic minority group residing in western China that has at times resisted the control of the Chinese communist party in Beijing. The Chinese government has a history of <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20020701facomment8515/chien-peng-chung/china-s-war-on-terror-september-11-and-uighur-separatism.html\">persecuting Uighurs</a>, and many have fled across the border to camps in Afghanistan. Some of them then had to flee again after the US invasion in October 2001 and ended up in Pakistan, where they were taken in by bounty hunters and turned over to US forces, <a href=\"http://hrw.org/reports/2008/us0608/4.htm#_Toc200538881\">ultimately arriving at Guant\u00e1namo</a> in June 2002. </p> <p>At Guant\u00e1namo, after Chinese officials interrogated the Uighurs, the Bush administration alleged the Afghan camp at which they were living was run by a member of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which was further alleged to be associated with al-Qaida. Each of the Uighurs adamantly denies any connection to ETIM, and while some admit that they wanted to return to their homeland to defend their fellow Uighurs against the \"Chinese occupiers\", as they describe them, most appeared to be in the camp waiting for the chance to travel further west, hoping for political asylum in Turkey or Iran. US courts have repeatedly held that even if the connection to ETIM was absolutely true, it would not be sufficient grounds to detain the Uighurs.</p> <p>So the case of the Uighurs is simultaneously simple and complex. Simple because all sides agree that they are not enemies of the US. Complex because all sides agree that the Chinese government views them as enemies. The Bush administration cleared some of the Uighurs for release as long ago as 2003. The Chinese have demanded their return, but international and domestic law prohibits the Bush administration from sending them to a fate of torture or worse. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/world/europe/10resettle.html\">Albania accepted five of the Guant\u00e1namo Uighurs</a> in 2006, but as Beijing has ratcheted up the pressure on it and other countries, no other nation has agreed to accept any Uighurs out of fear of repercussions in their relations with China. </p> <p>The obvious solution was to bring them into the US, but the Bush administration clung to the flimsy excuse that it could not allow immigrants into the US with connections to terrorist organisations, despite however tenuous the connection to ETIM. The real reason for the Bush administration's reticence is clear: they too were afraid of the wrath of China and perhaps conservative ideologues unwilling to accept that mistakes were made at Guant\u00e1namo. And so the Uighurs sat at Guant\u00e1namo, until now. </p> <p>US district judge Ricardo Urbina ordered the 17 remaining Guant\u00e1namo Uighurs brought to his courtroom on Friday and released into the <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=:ePkh8BM9EwLbwQq0w4ANYgubEFNqjgEr3LZUuJW5MIuMBGYEO1-cw6VxNfLir84KK517v9iAmgDP6RGe/0-0&amp;fp=48ed1efa97a96cf6&amp;ei=9CDtSJjDF5rUQbXnxIIJ&amp;url=http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100702685.html&amp;cid=1255094094&amp;usg=AFQjCNEND6B_s_0N1EX9KisaU4WwoWvCFQ\">Washington-area Uighur community</a>, but <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE497C0T20081009\">an appeals court granted a temporary stay</a> of the decision until October 16. The stay is a setback for the Uighurs, but the US government is unlikely to prevail on appeal, because Urbinia's decision really was the only one possible. These men are not enemy combatants, meaning the government has no grounds to detain them, and years of failed efforts to find another home meant the only realistic possibility for timely release was in the US. Urbina warned the government against its threatened action to re-arrest the Uighurs on immigration charges upon their eventual release. Hopefully, someone in the Bush administration has an ounce of decency left and the sense to avoid a tragic replay of this sorry episode of indefinite detention and injustice. </p> <p>Urbina's decision continues the trajectory of Guant\u00e1namo toward inevitable closure. Waiting until it is forced to release the Uighurs merely underscores the Bush administration's lack of courage to make the difficult questions necessary to close the prison. The greatest tragedy in this saga is that it was this cowardice that cost the Uighurs years of their lives.</p>",
  "<p>A unique proposal to protect one of the world's most biodiverse places from oil drilling is facing a looming deadline without any funding in place. </p> <p>The Ecuadorian government has said it is prepared to keep hundreds of millions of barrels of heavy crude oil in the ground, but in return it wants the international community to compensate it at the level of $350m (\u00a3202m) a year for a decade. </p> <p>The deadline \u2013 already postponed twice \u2013 is in December. While there has been political support from Spain, Germany and Norway, as yet there has been little in the way of hard cash.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ecuador-travel.net/biodiversity.parks.yasuni.htm\">Yasuni national park</a> in Ecuador lies at the intersection of the Amazon, the Andes and the equator and spans almost a million hectares of primary rainforest. It is home to indigenous tribes, who wish to be left in isolation, and an extraordinary array of wildlife and plants, much of it endangered. Avoiding the oil extraction would also prevent the release of an estimated 100m tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Environmentalists believe the innovative proposal has the potential to be a model for how developing countries manage their environments and the global fight against climate change.</p> <p>Nelson Torres, the Ecuadorian deputy ambassador to the UK, described it as a \"third way of management of climate change\" and said that it would \"lay the groundwork for energy transformation globally\". Anita Rivas, the indigenous mayor of Orellana, where Yasuni is located said: \"It's a brave proposal, a unique proposal.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://sef.umd.edu/sef2007.html\">Ishpingo Tambococha Tiputini</a> (ITT) field block lies in the south of Yasuni park, within an area officially designated in 1999 as an \"untouchable zone\" \u2013 a safe haven for those indigenous people who have chosen to live in isolation. The compensation package the Ecuadorian government is demanding is designed to deliver half the income that would accrue if the oil was extracted, over a period equating to the likely lifetime of the field.</p> <p>The government has shown a greater will than previous administrations to protect indigenous people and the environment. Last week, the nation overwhelmingly passed a constitution that granted Ecuador's tropical forests, islands, rivers and air similar legal rights to those normally granted to humans. But the president, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6187364.stm\">Rafael Correa</a>, is faced with the harsh economic reality that 70% of the country's income comes from oil and 38% of people in the South American republic live below the poverty line. </p> <p>In recent years, drilling has been allowed up to the boundaries of the \"untouchable zone\" but the region has seen little of the economic benefits, with a poverty rate in Orellana far higher than the national average. </p> <p>A statement from Penti Baihua, a member of the Huaorani tribe, said oil companies had contaminated water, soil and air, scared away animals, and brought diseases that had made members of their families ill and even killed them. </p> <p>\"The oil must stay in the ground in the ITT and the [untouchable] zone because it is our home. If the oil companies destroy all of the Yasuni, where will we live?\" he said. </p> <p>There is widespread support for drilling to be blocked in the ITT but not everyone agrees with the government's method. The meeting in London was organised by the <a href=\"http://www.yasunigreengold.org/\">Yasuni Green Gold campaign</a> to launch its book of the same name which highlights the park's vast array of plants and animals, believed to have resulted because the area did not freeze over during the last ice age. </p> <p>The campaign director and joint author of the book, Gin\u00e9s Haro Pastor, emphasised that while he supported financial help for Ecuador's development he felt it should be separated from the issue of the Yasuni. </p> <p>Yasuni Green Gold wants an unconditional commitment from the government not to drill oil in the untouchable zone regardless of financial pledges and wants it to scrap the idea of a deadline altogether. </p> <p>Environmental campaigner Tony Juniper, formerly executive director of Friends of the Earth, is enthusiastic about the concept of developing countries being compensated for protecting the environment. He believes taxes, including a small duty on foreign currency trades, could raise the tens of billions of pounds needed to replicate the Ecuadorian scheme around the world. </p> <p>But, he added, there were issues that needed to be ironed out, including whether countries should be able to seek compensation in respect of rainforest they had previously designated as protected, and whether wealthy nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia should be able to claim cash for not extracting oil.</p>",
  "<p>The Swedish Academy announced this lunchtime that French novelist Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl\u00e9zio has won the Nobel prize for literature. Announcing the prize, Horace Engdahl, the permanent secretary of the Nobel judges, saluted him as an \"author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilisation\".</p> <p>Le Cl\u00e9zio is the first French writer to take the 10m Swedish Krona (\u00a3815,000) prize since the French-Chinese author Gao Xingjian in 2000, although he was reluctant to identify himself strictly as a Frenchman. \"I started in France, but my father was a British citizen, born in Mauritius. So I see myself as a mix, like many people currently in Europe.\"</p> <p>\"I am very touched and very emotional, it is a great honour for me,\" he said, adding that he had been busy writing when the call came through. \"(I felt) some kind of incredulity, and then some kind of awe, and then some kind of joy and mirth,\" he told reporters at a press conference in Paris on Thursday afternoon. Asked if he deserved the prize, he replied \"Why not?\"</p> <p>Born in 1940, Le Cl\u00e9zio first found fame aged 23 with his debut novel Le Proc\u00e8s-Verbal, which was awarded the Prix Renaudot for its depiction of a young man who ends up in a mental hospital. Compared to Sartre's Nausea and Camus's The Outsider, the book introduced one of Le Cl\u00e9zio's major preoccupations, that of the flight from the norm to extreme states of mind. It is still regarded as one of his best pieces of writing.</p> <p>His real breakthrough as a novelist came with 1980's D\u00e9sert, whose tale of a lost culture in the North African desert and a Europe seen through the eyes of immigrants won him a French Academy prize.</p> <p>As well as living in France, the UK, Bangkok, Mexico City and Boston, between 1969 and 1973 Le Cl\u00e9zio lived with the Embera Indians in Panama. He has written of his time there in Ha\u00ef and Voyage de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, and has also translated some of the major works of the Indian tradition, such as Les proph\u00e9ties du Chilam Balam. His Le r\u00eave mexicain ou la pens\u00e9e interrompue shows his fascination with Mexico's past. The theme of the natural world is a unifying one for his writing, which spans some 50 novels, essays and short stories - although much of it is unavailable in print in the UK today.</p> <p>\"There are two phases to Le Cl\u00e9zio's career,\" said Adrian Tahourdin, French editor of the Times Literary Supplement. \"There's the early, more experimental work up until the early to mid 70s, and then he switched to much more lyrical, traditional narrative style, and started exploring other cultures more.\"</p> <p>Tahourdin said Le Cl\u00e9zio was a \"very worthy\" winner, although he was surprised by the choice. \"You can never second guess the sages of Stockholm, but he's a very good choice, he's a very good novelist,\" he said, adding that Le Cl\u00e9zio fitted the Nobel prize criteria of finding a body of work moving in an \"ideal direction\" rather well, writing as he does from the perspective of the downtrodden and dispossessed.</p> <p>One of Le Cl\u00e9zio's English translators, Alison Anderson, said she was \"absolutely over the moon\" at the news. \"I think the Nobel committee has made a choice for a voice of reason and compassion and empathy, which is not necessarily fashionable in literature, but is very important,\" she said.</p> <p>Anderson met Le Cl\u00e9zio when her English translation of his Onitsha was published, and said he was a \"very charming man - not reserved, but self-effacing\". She described Onitsha as the work she was most proud of translating; \"he writes very classical, beautiful French...it's very slow and incantatory so to keep that rhythm is a challenge, but very rewarding,\" she added.</p> <p>She hopes the win will mean more of his writing is translated into English. \"I always thought he was underacknowledged in the Anglo Saxon world. I continued to read his books after I translated Onitsha and I always thought they were wonderful - very quiet and moving. He's a real supporter of the underdog - people who don't have a voice of their own, he is their voice.\"</p> <p>Le Cl\u00e9zio's most recent works include 2007's Ballaciner, an essay about the history of the art of film, and Ritournelle de la faim, which has just been published.</p> <p>The choice of Le Cl\u00e9zio appears particularly pointed following the Academy's most senior judge Horace Engdahl's comments about American writing being insular and isolated. \"It almost seems like a rebuff\", said Tahourdin. \"There's always a political subtext with Nobel prizes, and choosing Le Cl\u00e9zio is particularly interesting because although he has written about America, he has written about pre-Columbian America.\"</p> <p>French president French President Nicolas Sarkozy was quick to hail the win as a sign of France's cultural influence. \"A child in Mauritius and Nigeria, a teenager in Nice, a nomad of the American and African deserts, Jean-Marie Le Cl\u00e9zio is a citizen of the world, the son of all continents and cultures,\" Sarkozy said. \"A great traveller, he embodies the influence of France, its culture and its values in a globalised world.\" </p> <p>The odds on the French author winning had originally been 14/1, but Ladbrokes said that following a sustained gamble, they fell through 10/1, 8/1, 4/1 and 2/1 before Le Cl\u00e9zio closed as the odds-on 1/2 favourite. \"It's the result we feared,\" said spokesman Nick Weinberg. \"Punters were convinced that Le Cl\u00e9zio's time had come and they were spot on.\" </p> <p>Le Cl\u00e9zio will receive the award at a ceremony in the Swedish capital in December. He has previously won the Prix Th\u00e9ophraste Renaudot (1963), Prix Larbaud (1972), Grand Prix Paul Morand de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise (1980), Grand Prix Jean Giono (1997), Prix Prince de Monaco (1998). The Nobel is his second Swedish award this year, after he won 2008's Stig Dagerman prize, which honors efforts to promote the freedom of expression.</p>",

  "<p>Coverage of the global financial meltdown in the wake of the credit crunch has tended to obscure reporting of events in the Middle East, a region apparently stuck in a never-ending political crunch. </p> <p>The build-up of more than 10,000 Syrian troops on the Lebanese border, nominally to \"stop smuggling\", a car bomb in Damascus, and continued fighting in and around the northern city of Tripoli, are all part of the continuing saga of poor relations between Syria and Lebanon since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/30/syria.unitednations\">2005 Syrian \"withdrawal\"</a> from Lebanese territory.</p> <p>Despite the incredible thaw in international relations with respect to Syria, including the possible offer of board membership of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Syria remains nominally in Washington's bad books. This was made clear in George Bush's speech at the United Nations last month, in which he said: \"A few nations \u2013 regimes like Syria and Iran \u2013 continue to sponsor terror, yet their numbers are growing fewer and they're growing more isolated from the world.\" </p> <p>Last week the bizarre story emerged of a US judge ordering Syria <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g1iYvOov3NAy8y-ctyKh-wVi9BrQD93J8S780\">to pay $400m to families of contractors killed in Iraq</a>, accusing the country of supporting those in Iraq who carried out the killings. </p> <p>But with US officials now admitting to <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-35805020081005\">a \"reconfiguration\" in policy</a> towards Syria, it is worth asking what those Syrian connections to the Iraqi insurgency and al-Qaida linked-groups actually are. </p> <p>The American military has consistently accused Syria of allowing al-Qaida fighters to cross into Iraq through its border. Yet the crux of the debate should be whether Syrian support for such groups is active or passive. Whereas Damascus's alliance with Hizbullah can be described as an active and largely stable relationship based on a rational strategy of non-conventional proxy attacks on their enemies, the blowback from supporting jihadis for a secular Ba'athist Syrian regime is an obvious danger. </p> <p>Yet links between Damascus and certain extremist groups have been proven. Shakir al-Absi, the commander of the fundamentalist Fatah al-Islam group that clashed with the Lebanese army in the battles of the Nahr al-Barid (the Palestinian refugee) camp in 2007, used to travel around Syria in total freedom.</p> <p>It seems that today, as the Damascus car bomb proved, other Islamist groups in Lebanon are being used back against Syria \u2013 in a form of tit-for-tat jihadi proxy-battle. Indeed Lebanon's leading cleric, Dai al-Islam al-Shahal, has warned Syria to stay out of north Lebanon or risk opening \"the gates of hell\". <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12342146\">The Economist</a> reported that \"after closing the borders, the Syrians got a message from the Salafists [Sunni jihadists]: you leave us alone or we target you\". </p> <p>These groups are said to have been supported by the anti-Syrian March 14 Alliance, headed by Saad Hariri, who called Syria \"a clear and direct threat\" to Lebanon. Yet he \"has been paying jihadis not to be jihadis but they've been rebelling against him\", according to Nadim Shehadi of Chatham House.</p> <p>Paradoxically, traditional American support for the March 14 anti-Syrian \u2013 and thus anti-Iranian \u2013 elements in Lebanon is thus linked to supporting al-Qaida-linked groups that the so-called war on terror is supposed to be directed against. </p> <p>Essentially Washington has found itself in a localised conflict with a bitter history that makes redundant policies such as \"with us or against us\". As the <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=96482\">Lebanese Daily Star reported last week</a>, \"too many people in both Beirut and Damascus appear to be operating under a winner-take-all mentality that can only guarantee net losses for all concerned\". </p> <p>The Syrian regime feels an ownership of Lebanon that can almost be compared to its ally Russia's quasi-sovereign control of South Ossetia. Syria also believes that the high tide of US power in the Middle East arrived in 2005, when Syria was forced out of Lebanon, and has been in decline ever since. </p> <p>In 1990 Syria was granted de facto American support for its occupation of Lebanon in exchange for joining in the anti-Saddam coalition. Today the Syrians believe helping a weak US achieve the right conditions for withdrawal from Iraq \u2013 hence help sealing the Iraq-Syria border, achieving influence with the so-called Awakening of Sunni tribesmen, and so on \u2013 should come at a similar cost of accepting high levels of Syrian suzerainty over Lebanon. With the Hariri tribunal seemingly on the back burner and Syria actively courting its neighbours \u2013 including Israel \u2013 the US \"diplomatic reconfiguration\" may do just that.</p>",
  "<p>I am rolling south. As my train crosses postcodes and county lines I am filled with a nebulous sense of regret that expands each mile farther I go from my cottage and my desk. But what are train journeys for, if not for writing? </p> <p>Well, as I was reminded, they make great listening posts too. Last week I overheard the following: \"Look buddy, I'm sorry, I just got hitched and my mother-in-law and her people are over from China, there's no way I can make it\u2026 sure I'll be on at 6, and yes, we'll do the rock'n'roll bagpipes \u2026 I'll try and find you someone else for the other slot \u2026 but I'm telling you, pipers don't get outta bed for less than \u00a3200 \u2026 believe me I used to be a pro, it takes time to get tartaned-up \u2026 I might know someone who can do it ... gimme an hour.\"</p> <p>The man, somewhere between pro-wrestler and college professor (braces, Oxford bags, beard, Bronx accent, impressive bulk), then proceeded to make a call to a dive bar in Soho asking for 'Joe the Killer', a toastmaster of some repute, I later learned. </p> <p>Trains allow us to move unnoticed through places and conversations, to eavesdrop with impunity. They allow us to be in the world but not of it, unlike the poet <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/getwritingni/wh_macneice.shtml\">Louis MacNeice</a>, himself no stranger to trains, who was once described as \"in the bar but not of it\". They let us absorb the speech patterns and registers of others, to slip for a moment into their modes of thought. (Am I alone in thinking the above might have been code for something more unsavoury than \"rock'n'roll bagpipes\"?)</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoem.do?poemId=7108\">Philip Larkin's Whitsun Weddings</a> the movement of a train lends to the poet's eye something of the camera lens, allowing him to observe with his trademark alacrity and precision a nation teetering on the brink of happiness. So on trains, in perception at least, we are lent a movement and partial-omnipotence usually reserved for the lesser gods or film directors with big budgets. We are gifted establishing shots, cut-aways, close-ups, our visual repertoire is extended as we keep up with a flock of starlings, or outpace the weather system moving in from the west. </p> <p>We see the backs of terraces where bicycles rust and how quickly districts move from gentrified to slum-like. In effect we short-circuit our usual way of perceiving the world; and this is exactly what good poems can do: make the usual unusual, strange, compelling. </p> <p>There is a kind of cordiality that persists on cross-country trains. You couldn't sit on a bendy bus down Oxford Street without fearing your laptop might be swiped or your listening-in taken the wrong way. For better or worse, on weekdays at least, the train carriage finds its natural analogy in the library. </p> <p>It is more your local lending library - complete with screaming kids, anoraks and that faint, pervasive and unplaceable smell \u2013 than the London Library. For that you have to upgrade, its source of melancholy captured in <a href=\"http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=15001\">Paul Farley's 'From a Weekend First' in his collection The Ice Age</a>.</p> <p>But trains sit deeper in the poet's psyche; they become freighted with meanings both sublimated and exposed \u2013 think of some of Don Paterson's poems in God's Gift to Women, where the train becomes the vehicle for, what Roland Barthes might call, the poet's image-repertoire for a failing love affair. </p> <p>I have a hunch about why trains outstrip planes and cars as a premier source of inspiration for travelling poets: poets are notoriously bad drivers. Planes were never in the running really: we are too poor to fly with any frequency though Colette Bryce ends her second collection with an almost <a href=\"http://www.thepoem.co.uk/poems/bryce.htm\">pitch-perfect description of a plane landing</a> and <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E0DA1530F933A15757C0A9679C8B63\">Seamus Heaney's Known World</a> is a classic of that tiny genre known as Eastern bloc literary festival inflight-smoking poems. </p> <p>I was told recently of a poet who was listing all the poets in his university department who were non-drivers. When he came to the sole member who could drive, he noted: \"Of course, he can but he shouldn't be allowed to.\" That should probably stand as a universal instruction to us all, in case we miss what Larkin calls the \"frail travelling coincidence\" that lies just outside the window.</p>",
  "<p>John Escreet, the Doncaster-raised pianist, has not only made a go of life in his adopted New York home, he has even been able to draw some of the city's sharpest rising talents into a UK tour. Tonight, the Escreet Project play plenty of spiky free-improv, quiet speculation and taut contemporary grooves, and the young audience look gripped. </p> <p>Escreet has involved himself in the kind of staccato rhythmic adventures practised in New York by the likes of saxophonists Tim Berne, Steve Lehman and David Binney - the formidable Binney and drummer Tyshawn Sorey are along for this trip. Sorey's double-taking delays, bumpy-road up-tempo playing and vicious tom-tom blows constantly fuel the band's energies. </p> <p>A rhythm-toying opener blended into a surging freebop feel, with Escreet playing a pushing ensemble role of electronic bleeps and bubbling sounds. Ambrose Akinmusire, a superb trumpeter, broke out of a quiet trilling into whooping exultation, before the band fell to such whispered meditation that the rattle of the ice bucket sounded like a car crash. Binney's alto sax then erupted into the first of two storming solos: his flying runs, split-note squeals and percussive accents followed at every turn by the astonishing Sorey. The group grew funkier toward the close, and ended, typically, on an abruptly unexpected dead halt.</p>"
