  "<p>Russia's punitive campaign in the Caucasus threatened to intensify into all-out war against Georgia last night, with Russian troops seizing control of strategic towns a couple of hours from the capital, and aircraft pounding Georgian infrastructure.</p> <p>Vastly outnumbered by the Kremlin's ground and air forces, the Georgian government announced it was pulling back its troops to defend the capital, Tbilisi, against a feared Russian onslaught. Washington accused the Kremlin of long preparing an invasion of Georgia in \"aggression that must not go unanswered\".</p> <p>\"Russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people. Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century,\" President George Bush said. \"The Russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on.\" He urged Russia to agree to a ceasefire offer by Georgia.</p> <p>The Georgian authorities said the town of Gori, 40 miles north of Tbilisi, had, in effect, fallen to the Russians, who were also advancing from the breakaway province of Abkhazia in the west into territory previously under Georgian control.</p> <p>\"The Georgian army is retreating to defend the capital. The government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of Georgia and further loss of life,\" said the Georgian government. Its president, Mikhail Saakashvili, said the Russian campaign was aimed at overthrowing his government.</p> <p>The Georgian embassy in London last night accused Russia of attempting to \"conquer\" Georgia. \"Today the statehood of Georgia is in great danger and thereby leaving existing world order in uncertainty.\"</p> <p>Giorgi Badridze, acting head of the embassy, compared Russia's actions with Nazi incursions into Europe in the run-up to the second world war.</p> <p>Alexander Lomaia of Georgia's National Security Council said: \"Russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of Georgia and occupying the country.\"</p> <p>The Kremlin spurned a chorus of western calls for a ceasefire, already accepted by Saakashvili, and appeared determined to ram home its military advantage at the risk of sparking an international crisis. Moscow seemed intent on imposing humiliating truce terms on Georgia.</p> <p>Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin, taking a leading role in the crisis, attacked Washington for helping Georgia fly home troops from Iraq and said the west was mistaking the aggressors for victims. \"The cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several US diplomats. It is a real shame,\" Putin said.</p> <p>France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is to try to mediate in Moscow today before meeting Saakashvili in the Georgian capital, while Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is to meet Russia's president, Dmitri Medvedev, in Sochi, just outside Georgia on the Black Sea, on Friday.</p> <p>The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, said: \"Russian aggression must not go unanswered and its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States.\"</p> <p>Military officials in Moscow insisted yesterday that Russian forces would not move beyond the contested region of South Ossetia on Georgia's northern border with Russia. Sergei Ivanov, the deputy prime minister, insisted Russian \"peacekeepers\" were contained in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The Russian defence ministry said: \"There are no Russian troops in Gori.\"</p> <p>But by last night sources in Moscow and Tbilisi and observers on the ground confirmed that Russian troops had advanced tens of miles into Georgian-held territory from Abkhazia.</p> <p>Russian troops and armoured vehicles were in control of a Georgian military base at Senaki, 25 miles beyond the Abkhaz boundary, UN military observers confirmed. The Russians had also seized Georgian police stations in Zugdidi after delivering an ultimatum to the Georgians to surrender their weapons near the Abkhaz frontlines. The towns of Kutaisi and Kurga were said to have been seized.</p> <p>Georgian officials claimed that Russian tanks seized Gori, smashing the Georgian lines in two places to take control of the town that straddles the road connecting the eastern and western parts of Georgia.</p> <p>Saba Tsitsikashvili, a local journalist in Gori, said Russian troops had occupied the main road on the edge of the city, but had not moved towards the centre. \"People are in panic. This road where the troops are is about 2km from the centre,\" she said.</p> <p>\"This is a full-scale invasion.\" said Irakli Batkuashvili, head of Georgia's military planning division. \"This is an occupation... Half of Georgia is under Russian control. Our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of Tbilisi.\"</p>",
  "<p>There we were on Sunday, my boyfriend, his son and I, crowded on the sofa, eating off our laps like a slightly less jaundiced version of The Simpsons, as we watched British cyclist Nicole Cooke climb the gold medal podium in Beijing. The same rainstorm that had bedevilled Cooke and her rivals as they sped around the 126km road race continued to beat down as she stood there, arms aloft, smile splitting her face, while the British national anthem rang out. She looked exhilarated, ecstatic, entrancing.</p> <p>\"Well,\" I said, taking a bite and leaving a significant pause before putting on my best Patricia Routledge impression, \"she could at least have brushed her hair.\"</p> <p>\"What!\" spluttered my 14-year-old stepson, \"She just completed a 78.5-mile road race, I don't think ...\"</p> <p>\"I was joking,\" I said, shaking my knife and fork at him. \"Joking!\"</p> <p>\"Oh,\" he said.</p> <p>And I was. Not a good joke, hands up. But the reason I'd made the comment was because of its incongruity, its obvious sarcasm - the notion that Cooke should have been thinking about anything except her triumph at that moment was patently ridiculous; the notion that she might be thinking about her looks was faintly offensive (and therein often lies the best comedy, although clearly not in this case). Here was a woman who had just battled against the best in the world, who had raced in quite awe-inspiringly nasty conditions - as she said later, they still had two hours to go when the torrential rain began - who had seemed to slip back in the very last leg, to lose momentum, fall away from the leaders, before powering through with such resilience and vigour over the last 200m, that her win suddenly came to seem inevitable. And, indeed, it was.</p> <p>As we watched her through those last bars of God Save the Queen, I realised that another reason I'd made the comment was that it was so long since I'd seen a woman being celebrated simply for what she'd done, that the image had come as some sort of shock to the system. Here was a woman being venerated for her power rather than her femininity, as a figure of absolute achievement and action and ambition. This wasn't about how Nicole Cooke looked, or what her success could sell, or who she might or might not be sponsored by. This was about Nicole Cooke and her will to win. Nicole Cooke and her toughness. Nicole Cooke's actions in the past few hours, not to mention all the hours of work she had put in during every one of her 25 years.</p> <p>And it wasn't long before another image of British female achievement popped up on my television screen. In the women's 400m freestyle swimming, the upper hand seemed to lie clearly with non-British competitors for most of the race, and in the final length it seemed that US swimmer Katie Hoff was bound to take it. At the last second, the 19-year-old British swimmer Rebecca Adlington pushed her nerve and verve and muscle beyond all expectation and cruised suddenly, shockingly, to a fingertip win. The BBC commentators were astounded. \"How on earth did she get Hoff?\" they said. \"Holy moley!\" And if the excitement of Adlington's win - the first Olympic gold for a British female swimmer in 48 years - wasn't enough, there was also the thrill of her teammate, 21-year-old Joanne Jackson, coming in third. As the two young women bobbed, exhausted, at the end of the swimming pool, taking in their triumph, beaming, hugging each other, tears welling in their eyes, it was another moment in which nothing mattered except their stunning achievement.</p> <p>Watching the swimming, tears pricking in my own eyes, I was confused as to why these images were hitting me so hard. Why did they seem so unusual - even unprecedented? I had seen Olympic events before. God knows I had seen people swim and cycle and ride horses. But at this particular moment, for some reason, these images of women seemed more significant than ever.</p> <p>Of course, Olympic events have always been important to female spectators, partly because we see so little women's sport the rest of the time. As we went to press, the only Team GB competitors to have won medals were women, and yet women's sporting achievements are usually entirely overlooked. A recent report by the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation (WSFF), Backing a Winner: Unlocking the Potential in Women's Sport, offered a stark range of statistics to this effect, statistics even worse than the biggest feminist-pessimist could ever have imagined. For instance, an analysis of all the national daily newspapers over the course of three days in March found that \"just 2% of articles and 1% of images in the sports pages of national newspapers are devoted to female athletes and women's sports ... Just 1.4% of sports photography featured women; and despite the fact our research only looked at the sports' pages, there were more images of models, footballers' girlfriends, the French president's wife and a nun than of sportswomen.\"</p> <p>The outlook wasn't any better when it came to other media. During the same period in March, Sky allocated just three of its 72 hours of sports programming to women's events. And of the 10 sports internet sites the WSFF reviewed, \"there were 367 links from the front page to articles, but just five links went to female sports (1%). There was not one image of a female athlete on the front page of the top 10 websites. Out of 129 images (both photos and film) - there were four images of women (3%): Sky Sports did have a film of two female sports presenters, a third image was of [former Big Brother contestant] Kate Lawler in her underwear in a marathon photograph shot, and a fourth image was of an advert for women's health.\"</p> <p>In the face of this, the Olympics represents a rare two-week period in which women's events are allocated almost as much coverage as those of their male counterparts. At Athens in 2004, women represented 40.7% of all the athletes who competed, taking part in 45% of all events. There are still a few areas in which women cannot compete - there is no women's ski jumping at the Winter Olympics, for example, and, as Nicole Cooke and fellow British cyclist Victoria Pendleton have pointed out, women can only enter three events at the velodrome, compared with seven events for the male competitors. But, for the most part, the Olympics represents something close to parity. It is a competition in which we can watch women take on a massive range of challenges - from archery to athletics to one of the most compelling events of this Olympics so far, the women's weightlifting.</p> <p>As the years have passed, more and more events have been added to the female competition; in 1998, women's ice hockey joined the roster, in 2002, women's bobsleigh, in 2004, women's wrestling. And audiences seem to pay the same amount of respect to each event, regardless of the sex of those participating. As Harriet Foxwell, head of communications for the WSFF, says, during the Olympics, there is a real \"team ethos, an interest in what the British team is doing as a whole. There isn't a separation between male and female events.\"</p> <p>In this sense the Olympics is quite different to another sport that gives similar weight to male and female coverage: tennis. I enjoy tennis a great deal, but when it comes to coverage of the women's events at Wimbledon, for instance, there seems to be at least as much focus on what the women are wearing, what kind of shape they're in, how they're styling their hair, who's designing their outfits and whether or not they are grunting, as there is on their actual performance. The women at Wimbledon are fantastic athletes - you only had to watch this year's final between Serena and Venus Williams to recognise that - but they are also often objectified to a worrying degre. As Gina Dessalines, co-founder of the website <a href=\"http://www.womensportreport.com\">womensportreport.com</a>, says: \"When you see the camera shots that are taken when the female players are on court, and you compare that with the camera shots when the male players are on court, there's definitely an attitude that they're looking for the feminine shot - those moments when they can zoom in on a woman's legs, for example. And then, in all the tennis coverage, there's the massive interest in fashion. Even the people who are interviewing the women, post-match, will say, 'How are you going to dress for tonight's event?' which is a long way off the point.\"</p> <p>Foxwell agrees. \"What's great with the Olympics is the immediacy of it all - you see the women competing, and then they're on the rostrum straight away, looking incredibly natural, and that's so great to see. When it comes to tennis coverage, there are so many links between the sports and the fashion worlds now - a lot of the promotion around Wimbledon this year concerned parties, for instance, rather than just that specific focus on the sports field.\"</p> <p>The biased nature of the tennis coverage is interesting, and the focus on femininity rather than ferocity is certainly galling, but it has existed in other years too, and has never made the Olympics seem especially more feminist by comparison. In fact, I think, what is making this year's competition so rapturous for women is the contrast of the Olympic coverage with the general media attitude to women over the past four years. The celebrity culture, the reality-show culture, the tendency to venerate women who are presented as airheads, stretches back long before 2004, but it is in the past few years that it has reached its zenith. And it is in the past few years, also, that it has taken its ugliest turn, and we have seen an increasing cultural obsession with women on the verge of a nervous breakdown, women who are clearly in psychological turmoil, in and out of rehab, stumbling along the street, with blood on their face and legs and shoes. The image of women that we have been sold for the past few years has been one in which, at best, we are valued only for our looks. More commonly, it seems, we're represented as broken, bedraggled and bewildered.</p> <p>And it is, most pertinently, against this backdrop that the stars of Beijing 2008 have been performing. Recently our expectations of coverage of women have been lowered, nullified; we have become used to seeing that strange category - celebrity women - pictured constantly, relentlessly, their image before us for no other reason than that they happen to have headed out for a pint of milk with their makeup on skew-whiff. At Beijing we have seen the antithesis of that - we have been treated to the sight of ordinary women reaching extraordinary heights. The women we have been thrilling to aren't in our eyeline because they happen to be the offspring of some 1970s rocker, or because they've bagged a multimillionaire boyfriend. They aren't on screen because they have starved themselves to a size zero - instead, their bodies are a celebration of strength. They are women like Cooke, who grew up in Wick, in the Vale of Glamorgan, and has become the first British cyclist, male or female, to win an Olympic road race. Or like Adlington, from Mansfield, who started swimming at the age of seven at her local swimming pool and says that her motto is to \"have fun, there's no point otherwise\". Or Jackson, who comes from Richmond in North Yorkshire and swims for her local club, Derwentside.</p> <p>These are women whose success is an incredible testament to their strength of will, but also represents something accessible - Cooke has spoken about her memories of getting her first bike, memories which will strike a chord with many a kid, while all those provincial children trotting off to their swimming lessons next weekend can remember the fact that Adlington and Jackson got off to just the same start.</p> <p>Will this Olympics change the way that we see women? It's very early days yet. It has the potential to do so if these notable successes lead to a general increase in the coverage of women's sport, because, as Foxwell notes, visible role models can lead to increased sporting participation, which ultimately can result in increased happiness, confidence and success.</p> <p>Whether this year's event represents a short- or long-term improvement in coverage of women and our achievements or not, we should bask in the next two weeks. Just compare the image of Adlington and Jackson, dressed in their power racing suits, celebrating their success, faces lit up with incredulous joy, with that image of Paris Hilton last week, dressed in a cut-out swimsuit, reclining on a sun lounger, mouthing someone else's words in what was, admittedly, a funny rebuke to John McCain. Straggly hair and all, it's clear which of those images is the most inspiring. Let's take to our sofas and enjoy it.</p> <h2>Claire Tolley profiles six British women to watch out for at the Beijing Olympics</h2> <p><strong>Heather Fell, modern pentathlon, 25</strong></p> <p>Fell was ranked fourth in the world going into the games in a gruelling 12-hour event that combines fencing, shooting, a 200m freestyle swim, showjumping and a 3km run. Her training day starts at 5am with a two-hour swim, followed by running or riding before lunch, then shooting or fencing. She was named the British Olympic Association's \"one to watch\" for 2007 after winning silver at the European championship and is hoping for a podium place after setting personal bests in May this year in the swim and the run. The Devon-based penathlete, who graduated from Brunel University, has put a physiotherapy career on hold in her attempt to win Olympic gold and instead works on Friday afternoons in her local pub to keep her grounded.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Ayton, sailing (yngling class), 28</strong></p> <p>Ayton hopes to win a second gold to add to the Olympic title she won with Sarah Webb and Shirley Robertson in the Athens Olympics in 2004, when their success earned them overnight celebrity and the patronising nickname \"three blondes in a boat\". Now with Ayton at the helm with Webb and new crew member Pippa Wilson, the trio came to Beijing having won back-to-back world championship titles and the test event at the Olympic sailing venue in Qingdao. Ayton, who started sailing at the age of six, is engaged to British windsurfer Nick Dempsey, who won bronze in Athens. The pair, who will marry in October, have agreed that if one of them wins the gold here they will have the right to keep their name. If both win gold, their surnames will be double-barrelled.</p> <p><strong>Debbie Flood, rowing (quadruple sculls), 28</strong></p> <p>Yorkshire-born Flood won silver four years ago in Athens and hopes to go one better this time with her crew of Frances Houghton, Annie Vernon and Katherine Grainger. A devout Christian, she excelled at athletics as a teenager and was selected for the national youth squad at judo, but a chance session on a rowing machine at her father's gym revealed a talent for the sport. After a summer course with Tideway Scullers at Eton College aged 16, she opted to pursue rowing at the highest level. Whatever happens in Beijing, though, she will quit the sport for a year to work full-time in the prison service before returning to train for the 2012 games.</p> <p><strong>Shanaze Reade, cycling (BMX), 19</strong></p> <p>The Crewe teenager is the favourite to win gold when BMX makes its Olympic debut after cruising to victory in this year's world championships. Nicknamed \"Speedy Readey\", she beat all male competitors to become British No 1 in 2006. She made her seniors debut the following year, becoming women's world BMX champion and winning the world team sprint track title with Victoria Pendleton. When deciding what GCSEs to take, she got a phone call. \"My coach rang to say BMX had been introduced to the Olympics. That was it. I'd wanted to be an English teacher but you can go back to college. You can't go back to being an Olympic gold medallist.\"</p> <p><strong>Beth Tweddle, gymnastics (asymmetric bars), 23</strong></p> <p>The South Africa-born gymnast has endured a tough time in the games, missing out on the floor final and struggling into the bars final in eighth place as she recovers from a rib injury. With the final next Monday, however, Tweddle will be hopeful of conjuring a performance to match the quality that made her world and European champion in the discipline two years ago. Beijing will be Tweddle's final Olympics - she is planning a career in physiotherapy when she retires after next year's world championships having combined training six hours a day, six days a week, with studying to complete a sports science degree last summer.</p> <p><strong>Kelly Sotherton, athletics (heptathlon), 31</strong></p> <p>In Athens four years ago, all eyes were on the defending champion, Britain's Denise Lewis, but the surprise medallist was the then 27-year-old Sotherton, ranked only 21st in the world. Moments after winning bronze, Sotherton was in tears after her and Lewis's coach, Charles van Commenee, branded her a wimp for not running quick enough in the 800m to win silver. The tears dried and Sotherton, an outspoken former debt collector, admitted Van Commenee was absolutely right. With the Olympic champion Carolina Kluft deciding not to compete in Beijing, Sotherton knows she has to grasp a last chance for Olympic gold - providing she can overcome her jitters in the javelin.</p>",

  "<p>Hind Al-Rubawawi twirls on the dance floor with her groom. Dressed in white, including the obligatory hijab, the 22-year-old university student from Baghdad beams as she gazes at her new husband, Sami Al-Tameemi, and the 50 or 60 guests gathered to celebrate her wedding. Instead of confetti, her new mother-in-law throws sweets, while her young brothers run about with a spray can sending fake snow flakes into the air. It is a joyful occasion, but this wedding, at a dance hall in Damascus, Syria, nearly didn't happen.</p> <p>These days it is almost impossible to have a wedding in Baghdad. Some couples, like Hind and Sami, are choosing to marry abroad at great expense, while others forgo the wedding in favour of perfunctory legal and religious formalities. \"Often fundamentalists come to break up parties and set off bombs, or fight with the military or the family to make instability,\" explains Hind. </p> <p>Before 2003, it was common to have up to 1,000 people at a wedding, and when Hind's parents got married in the 1980s, their guest list numbered well into the hundreds. They had a big party at a hotel in Baghdad with a singer and a band, and went on honeymoon for a week in the Iraqi countryside. Yet for many of Hind's friends, getting married has been a much quieter affair. \"Since the war everyone has been afraid and they've reduced the weddings, so it's only at home, it's not so big, and it's without music because the fundamentalists and military don't allow it,\" she says. \"Some people only go to get the bride from her father's home and take her away without any celebration.\"</p> <p>Another reason why Hind and Sami came to Damascus is that 42-year-old Sami is a refugee, legally resident in Norway. The expense and difficulty of organising a wedding and obtaining visas for both families meant that a Norwegian wedding was impossible, so Damascus was chosen as the next best option to Baghdad. Sami left Iraq in 2006 because, having been a member of the Ba'ath party as a student, the situation had become dangerous. \"I was not in a high position - it was normal within the university,\" Sami says. \"But with the US invasion, they were starting to kill many Ba'athists and were making troubles for me so I decided to leave.\" Sami was accepted as a humanitarian rather than political refugee after al-Qaida seized his father's house and burned his papers.</p> <p>The couple had not met in person until a week before the wedding, but the courtship started seven months ago. In December, Sami told his friend Hashim, Hind's uncle, that he wanted to marry. Hashim played matchmaker by contacting Hind's family and securing permission to pass on her telephone number and email address. The courtship was carried out by phone and on Yahoo! Messenger, with a webcam. Though the couple's first meeting was at the airport in Damascus, both say it was their own decision to marry and that they are very much in love. Once Sami had proposed to Hind, his family paid a visit to her family. On the second occasion they brought her the engagement ring, a gold necklace and another ring as an engagement present. Sami is also expected to provide Hind with \u00a32,600 as security in the event of divorce. \"The internet helps many young couples connect with each other and make a family,\" Sami says. \"It was, of course, my dream to get married in Baghdad, but the particular situation was too difficult to arrange a marriage there, and for me to go to Iraq.\"</p> <p>Marrying in Damascus might be practical for security reasons, but it is an expensive exercise. Hashim, a businessman with interests in Damascus, played an instrumental role in securing passports, visas and car hire, and renting apartments in the Sayedah Zeinab area, 10km from central Damascus, where many Iraqis live.</p> <p>Sami is one of 10 children and his mother, father and three siblings travelled to the wedding from Baghdad, while a fourth came from his home in Vienna. Hind's mother, grandmother and two brothers travelled to the wedding, but her father and another brother and sister remained behind because of the expense. For the Baghdad contingent, costs ran to \u00a3180 each for a passport and visa, \u00a350 each for the businessman's card that the Syrian government require for every visitor, even Hind's 78-year-old grandmother, and \u00a320 each for car hire. Hind's family faced a 14-hour drive from Baghdad to Damascus, but the 10-hour stopover at the border made the journey much longer. </p> <p>When the bride and groom arrived in Damascus, their first step was to be married by a mullah. Since Sami and Hind are practising Shia Muslims, they could not be together in public until they were married, so the mullah came directly to the family home. During the ceremony, as is customary, Hind was asked three times, in private, if she was being forced into the marriage, to which her answer was no. A few days later came the civil wedding in the courts in Damascus. Sami and Hind repeated their vows before the court officials, and Sami and Hashim shook hands - symbolising the contract between both families. Sami then spent the rest of the day getting papers signed and stamped by various officials. </p> <p>Finally it is time for the party. It might not be on the scale of pre-2003 Baghdad weddings, but the number of family and friends present is an indication of how many Iraqis are now living in Damascus. There is a band with a singer - though many people cover their ears to the Arab pop music as the sound system is so loud. There is a western-style cake, which Sami and Hind cut with a sword. The guests drink Fanta - although a few sip beer secretly under the tables so as not to offend the more religious family members - and eat roast chicken, pita, tabbouleh and hummus. Ordinarily in Iraqi culture, there is a breakfast for family the day after the wedding - so they can check the sheets for the signs of blood they believe prove the bride is a virgin. The custom is waived in this case, not because of any modern sensibility, but because it is deemed sensible to preserve Hind's virginity until she has the visa to join Sami in Norway.</p> <p>Hind studies French at Mustansiriya University in Baghdad and only has one more year to go, so the couple have decided that she should finish her studies before she moves to Norway. \"I would like to get married to a woman who has education so I can have a discussion with her,\" Sami says. He is also keen that she study English and Norwegian when she arrives in Norway, so that she can mix with the community. Sami works at a gas company in Molde and he says that while there are a few other Iraqi families there, he has been making an effort to integrate, participating in a government programme that twins refugees with local families, and joining a political party. \"The Norwegians have given me peace and stability and this is what I hope to give to Hind so that she does not sit at home and feel lonely,\" Sami says. \"I love her and she loves me, and everything will be OK. This is most important. But also she should learn the language so we can introduce [her to] the culture and the people and she will feel at home.\" </p> <p>This trip to Damascus has been Hind's first glimpse of life outside Iraq. Living in Baghdad has, she says, become increasingly constrained. \"Now, when the sun sets we should be at home. Before 2003, we could go to the theatre, make excursions. Now it's impossible, it's all closed,\" she says. \"We live in a Shia area so it's not so bad as the mixed areas, which is where they have the most problems, but I still can't go with my friends on the streets.\"</p> <p>Hind is not nervous about her impending move to Norway. \"I think it will be not such a big problem because they have a few Iraqi families there,\" she says. \"My dream is to make a happy family and I will give 100% to fulfil that vision\".</p>",
  "<p>Every cliche has to start somewhere, and I blame Voula Patoulidou for the one that currently infests Beijing like a plague of locusts. Back in 1992, when she had just won the 100m hurdles and become the first Greek woman to secure an Olympic gold medal, Patoulidou said: \"I think I am dreaming now.\" It sounded simple, beautiful and fresh.</p> <p>Four years later the idea was picked up by Linda Thompson, a former Miss Tennessee, a sometime girlfriend of Elvis Presley and the ex-wife of Bruce Jenner, the 1976 Olympic decathlon champion. When Ms Thompson, who must have spent plenty of time listening to Elvis singing Follow That Dream and If I Can Dream during her four-year stay at Graceland, wrote the lyrics to the theme tune for the Atlanta Olympics, she called it The Power of the Dream.</p> <p>Already the idea was beginning to lose its simplicity, its beauty and its freshness. And now, staring at the posters that declare \"One World One Dream\" from every available flat surface in the Chinese capital, including the walls of motorway toll booths, the constant harping on the connection between the Olympic Games and dreams simply makes you want to throw up.</p> <p>One dream, eh? What dream would that be, exactly? Oh, world peace. Ah, right. Well, that's certainly going to be brought a lot closer by the activities of a bunch of runners, jumpers, throwers, rowers, swimmers and shooters, not to mention a squad of overpaid slam-dunkers. Jacques Rogge, who seems to be an intelligent man, should be ashamed of himself for allowing the sole true purpose of the Games - which is to identify champions in various sporting disciplines - to be hijacked by governments intent on using this pointless and infantilising idealism to camouflage their sordid ambitions.</p> <p>Rogge would probably refer his critics to the words of Pierre de Coubertin, the father of the modern Games. \"Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in effort, the educational value of a good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles,\" the Baron said, illustrating his devotion to the kind of muscular Christianity practised in English public schools during the second half of the 19th century. On another occasion he added: \"May the Olympic torch pursue its way through ages, increasing friendly understanding among nations, for the good of a humanity always more enthusiastic, more courageous and more pure.\"</p> <p>That kind of nonsense is also presented as an excuse for the ever-increasing use of children in the Games' opening ceremony. As we left the Bird's Nest on Friday night more than one person remarked that it was easy to detect the residual traces of Steven Spielberg's aborted contribution to the show in the appearance of little girls dressed in red, one singing a saccharine ballad and another floating on wires above one of the many elaborate tableaux vivants. Spielberg and the guardians of the Olympic flame seem to share a desire to persuade us all to aspire to the condition of children, when what they should be trying to do - assuming they have any didactic function at all - is to get us to act like grown-ups.</p> <p>If it sometimes seems as though the whole Olympic image thing is a cross between the old Coca-Cola \"I'd like to teach the world to sing\" TV ad and the United Colours of Benetton campaign, that's because it is. There is no coincidence here. As well as providing cosmetic opportunities for countries with an image problem, the Games also exist to induce us to buy stuff, in this case the stuff being peddled by the Games' official sponsors, including McDonald's, Adidas, Samsung, Visa, Johnson and Johnson and, yes, Coca-Cola itself. And the best way to do that is through Spielbergian airheaded nonsense that makes people feel better about themselves with absolutely no justification.</p> <p>If you want to know what brought on this outburst of thoroughly uncharacteristic cynicism, it was the experience of switching on BBC World in my Beijing hotel room late the other night and watching Panorama's exemplary investigation into China's arms supplies to Sudan. The smiling man waving to the smiling crowds in the Bird's Nest was the very one who had endorsed the sales of Dongfeng trucks carrying heavy machine-guns and Fantan A5 fighter jets to a genocidal government in order to secure a supply of oil. The next morning I got up and sat through the repeat, before taking a 45-minute bus ride to the finish of the cycling road race course, passing perhaps a thousand \"One World One Dream\" posters en route. That did it. And I dare say it would do it to you, too.</p> <h2>An eternal mystery in a black border</h2> <p>The news of the murder in the centre of Beijing on Saturday came with the suddenness of the pipe bomb that exploded in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park midway through the Games 12 years ago. On both occasions a senseless tragedy put a black border around the joy-filled pictures from the medal ceremonies.</p> <p>It took the US authorities seven years to apprehend Eric Rudolph, a former army security expert who committed the crime that killed a local woman and a Turkish television cameraman and wounded 111 others. Initially a security man in the park, Richard Jewell, came under such heavy suspicion that the local press had him tried and convicted long before it was confirmed that it was he, in fact, who discovered the bomb and heroically moved people to safety before it went off.</p> <p>Rudolph, it transpired, was a right-wing fanatic who subsequently attacked an abortion clinic and a lesbian night-club in the Atlanta area. After being arrested in a small town in North Carolina, he was sentenced to four life terms without parole and is currently held in a maximum-security prison in Colorado, with the Unabomber, the Oklahoma City bomber and the 1993 World Trade Centre bomber for company.</p> <p>No one will ever know what caused Tang Yongming to stab his American victims on Saturday. By hurling himself from the viewing platform of the Drum Tower, he ensured that his appalling crime will remain forever inscrutable.</p> <h2>Falling market for Olympian kit</h2> <p>So history didn't end, after all, as Francis Fukuyama would discover if he visited the Olympic Games, where changes in geopolitical and economic power are reflected in miniature. In Atlanta, then Sydney, the centre of the host city was populated with athletes from poorer countries who had completed their events and were raising funds by selling off their kit. You could pick up a Kazakhstan team T-shirt or an official Cuba pin for very little money and help send a young weightlifter or boxer home happy. Doesn't seem to happen now.</p> <p><strong>Murray takes to Couch over breakfast</strong></p> <p>So, Jamie Murray, exactly what was it that inspired you to stroll across the food court in the athletes' village in Beijing and invite yourself to breakfast with young Tom Daley and another member of the diving team, the 19-year-old vision of blonde loveliness known as Tonia Couch?</p>",
  "<p>The Premier League is facing an unprecedented trial of its fit and proper persons test after arrest warrants were issued for the Manchester City owner, Thaksin Shinawatra, in Thailand yesterday. His next step may be to apply for political asylum in Britain but, should he be convicted in Thailand in his absence, the Premier League would be prepared to reassess his suitability to own a club. </p> <p>In what would be an unprecedented case the Premier League would take legal advice before making a decision that could result in Thaksin having to sell his stake in Manchester City. Whether the league would recognise a conviction in Thailand should Thaksin receive political asylum has yet to be determined. The league could yet be spared that difficulty if Thaksin elects to sell the club, although a City spokesman yesterday said the businessman has no such plans.</p> <p>Under the fit and proper persons test \"any director is automatically disqualified if convicted of one of a number of offences by a 'competent court' anywhere in the world\". Thaksin is currently a \"fit and proper\" owner as he has not been convicted. He has denied the charges, claiming they were politically motivated. </p> <p>Legal officials in Bangkok have confirmed the case against Thaksin will continue in his absence. The Thai authorities may also seek to extradite the billionaire and his wife unless they are granted political asylum. Two weeks ago Thaksin's wife, Pojaman, was sentenced to three years in jail for tax fraud but was granted bail.</p> <p>Richard Scudamore, the Premier League chief executive, said: \"If we feel the rule has been breached, we will invoke it. We will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature. As always, we will take advice from the Home Office and the Foreign Office.\"</p> <p>A court in Bangkok issued the warrants after the deposed Thai prime minister and his wife fled to Britain on Sunday rather than face corruption charges. They travelled to London from the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing . Thaksin claimed \"that there is a continuation of dictatorship in Thai politics ... which is followed by interference in the justice system\".</p> <p>Of more concern to City fans is the club's increasingly uncertain financial future. Thaksin is unable to release an estimated \u00a3800m in assets frozen by the Thai government in June last year and was seeking new investors in the club prior to his latest exile.</p>",
  "<p>Terence Rigby, one of those actors who seemed to pop up all the time on television but was also a respected theatre actor, has died at his London home aged 71. </p> <p>Rigby died on Monday night after suffering from lung cancer. </p> <p>His TV credits were numerous: from Inspector Barlow's enforcer from the dog unit, PC Snow, in Softly Softly, to suspected mole Roy Bland in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, to Big Al in The Beiderbecke Affair. Add to that parts in Dixon of Dock Green, Rumpole of the Bailey, Van der Valk, Heartbeat, and Holby City and there has hardly been a year since the sixties when Rigby was not in something.</p> <p>He was equally hard-working in theatre - whether it was the West End, RSC or the National - being a particular favourite of his friend Harold Pinter. He was in the original cast of The Homecoming in 1965 as would-be boxer Joey and was the first to play thuggish manservant Briggs in No Man's Land, 10 years later. Another to cast him time and again was Peter Hall and Rigby was a natural to play Pozzo when Hall directed Waiting for Godot in the West End. </p> <p>Rigby's film roles included Mona Lisa Smile, Elizabeth and General Bukharin in the Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies.</p> <p>The Birmingham-born actor decided late in life - about 10 years ago - to settle in New York, living in a small studio flat and working in both Britain and the US.</p> <p>Catherine Sparks, Rigby's sister, said he was \"the actor's actor\" - demonstrated perhaps by the fact his referees for his original US green card included John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson. She added: \"We are so proud of Terry and are going to miss him terribly. He was true to his art and respected by all the industry.\" His agent Peter Charlesworth said: \"There are not so many like him anymore.</p> <p>\"He was a very powerful character actor, able to play villains and nice roles with ease. He was particularly good at playing Pinter roles, which were very difficult.\" </p> <p>Pinter's biographer, the Guardian theatre critic Michael Billington, said: \"He had weight on stage, this strong dominating physical presence. When he came on there was a sense of something dangerous.\"</p>",
  "<p>As busloads of refugees from the conflict in South Ossetia continued to flow into Russia yesterday, mourning families prepared to bury the first fighters killed in the battle.</p> <p>Hundreds of men from the bordering Russian region of North Ossetia have travelled into the war zone over the past few days to support Russian army units and South Ossetian military, fighting Georgian forces. Ill-equipped or poorly trained, some were killed within hours of arrival.</p> <p>Murat Dryaev, 29, a construction worker, left for the war on Thursday and was brought home in a coffin two days later. He lived with his parents at the end of a stony track in Novy Batakayur, a village 10 miles from the North Ossetian capital, Vladikavkaz. Yesterday his relatives sat in vigil around his open coffin, adorned with roses and his photograph.</p> <p>\"He went to defend his sister and her children who live in South Ossetia,\" said his wife, Ira, weeping over her husband's pallid face. \"But he never reached the place where they hand out weapons.\"</p> <p>Dryaev and his group of volunteers were hit by Georgian artillery fire. It is not known how many others died. </p> <p>\"His three-year-old daughter still thinks he's coming home,\" said his sister, Larisa. The dead man's mother, Teresa, sat at the head of the coffin. \"She's been speechless, like a living corpse,\" said Larisa. \"She begged him not to go but she couldn't stop him.\"</p> <p>The family said they did not know the fate of the sister Murat went to save. Many refugees in North Ossetia and further afield in Russia were struggling to contact the relatives they had left behind amid reports of fresh fighting in Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital.</p> <p>The estimated 30,000 people who have escaped into Russia have been put up in hotels and holiday camps across the south of the country, where they have been given free food, medicines and phone calls. A further 60 busloads of refugees were due to arrive in Vladikavkaz last night.</p> <p>At the recruitment centre for volunteer fighters in the city, Colonel Nerses Avetisyan said the centre would be switching its efforts to relief work in South Ossetia, \"to do everything possible to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe\". </p> <p>Russia's emergencies minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the urgent priorities would be bread, a water supply, and hospitals.</p> <p>Today the first convoy of 80 aid trucks reached Tskhinvali from Russia, escorted by several armoured cars. The trucks delivered food, diesel generators, medicines, a mobile hospital and water. Further convoys are planned and teams of electricians and plumbers are to be dispatched to South Ossetia in the coming days. Sniffer dogs will be used to search for people trapped under the rubble of the ruined capital.</p> <p>Shoigu said there were plans to send extra teachers to southern Russian to cope with the influx of more than 5,000 refugee children into local schools.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's beleaguered president, Pervez Musharraf, faced a direct challenge from al-Qaida yesterday, after the terrorist group lambasted his record in a video.</p> <p>Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaida's deputy leader, whose voice apparently appeared on the tape, spoke in English and called for an uprising against Musharraf and the Pakistan state, which he said was \"virtually ruled from the American embassy\".</p> <p>The video came as Pakistan's parliament convened yesterday for the start of a special session on impeachment proceedings against Musharraf. The government has not yet released its \"charge sheet\" against the president but al-Qaida spelled out its anger in the video. </p> <p>\"Pervez has insulted and compromised Pakistan's sovereignty by allowing the CIA and FBI to operate freely in Pakistan and arrest, interrogate, torture, deport and detain any person, whether Pakistani or not, for as long as they like, thus turning the Pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade,\" said Zawahiri. </p> <p>The al-Qaida leader denounced Musharraf for the crackdown he ordered on Islamabad's radical Red Mosque - an army raid last year resulted in about 100 deaths - and his treatment of the renegade Pakistani nuclear scientist, Dr AQ Khan, who has been under house arrest for four years. </p> <p>The vitriol against Musharraf from extremists demonstrated how dangerous it would be for him to remain in Pakistan after leaving office, where he has heavy security. The authenticity of the recording, delivered to a Pakistani news channel over the weekend, could not be verified. </p> <p>Zawahiri said he was speaking in English to directly appeal to the people of Pakistan, regretting that he did not know Urdu, the national language. </p> <p>There were suggestions in the Pakistani media that the video had been \"cooked up\" by Musharraf's aides to boost public opinion in his favour, just as an al-Qaida video on the eve of the last US presidential election appeared to help George Bush's political standing. </p> <p>Al-Qaida's message was much broader than an attack on Musharraf, with the group calling for a jihad against the Pakistani state, including the government and military. The army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, was singled out as a \"hostile enemy of Islam\". </p> <p>\"The dominant political forces at work in Pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern-day crusaders in the White House, and are working to destabilise this nuclear-capable nation under the aegis of America,\" said Zawahiri. </p> <p>Musharraf shows no signs of resigning, as many predicted after the ruling coalition announced last week that it would try to impeach him. Parliament would need a two-thirds majority to convict him. </p> <p>The impeachment process could take three weeks. The charges are expected to be based on Musharraf's alleged subversion of the constitution. Yesterday, the assembly of the Punjab, the most powerful province, kicked off with a resolution that declared the president unfit for office, which was passed by 321 to 25 votes. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to battle militants - some linked to al-Qaida - on its north-west border. At least 100 militants and nine paramilitary personnel have died in clashes that began last week in the Bajur region.</p>",
  "<h2>Man who blackmailed top footballer faces jail</h2> <p>A goalkeeper who blackmailed a Premiership footballer over sex pictures wept as he was told he faced an \"inevitable\" jail sentence. Ashley Timms, 22, was said to have made a \u00a315,000 demand with menaces from the star, who cannot be named, to stop him publishing images of a \"sexual nature\". Timms was said to have made the threats through text messages and phone calls. The goalie was due to stand trial yesterday but changed his not guilty plea to guilty after the prosecution produced mobile phone evidence at Manchester crown court.

The drug uses strands of the genetic material RNA to silence a gene that produces a protein called PCSK9, which raises cholesterol levels. The technique, known as RNA interference, has been lauded as one that will bring about the next revolution in medical science. In time it may be possible to use it to switch genes on and off at will. Work on the procedure won two American scientists the Nobel prize for Medicine in 2006. <br><strong>Ian Sample</strong></p> <h2>Man guilty of killing three in dispute over drugs</h2> <p>A man was yesterday convicted of the murder of three people who were shot dead with a sub-machine gun during a drugs deal.

It said the risk of depression increases with age, but pensioners seeking help are often fobbed off or misdiagnosed. GPs may issue prescriptions for drugs when counselling would offer more benefit. The charity said: \"It is scandalous that hundreds of thousands of older people may be denied treatment because depression is wrongly seen as a natural part of getting older.\" <br><strong>John Carvel</strong></p>",
  "<p>The former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra skipped bail yesterday and fled to exile in Britain, claiming he could not expect a fair trial on corruption charges because of political interference.</p> <p>Thaksin and his wife, Pojaman, who was sentenced to three years in prison two weeks ago for fraud, said they flew to Britain because they had received \"death threats\" in Thailand. </p> <p>Rumours were rife that the couple would flee after Pojaman, 51, was convicted of evading millions of pounds in taxes in connection with a 1997 shares transfer deal. But family aides had scotched the suggestion.</p> <p>Immediately after Pojaman was sentenced, along with her stepbrother, Bhanapot Damapong, and former secretary, Kanchanpana Honghern, on July 31, Thaksin left for a speaking engagement in Japan before travelling to China for the Olympics opening ceremony. Last Thursday the trio boarded a flight for Beijing to meet Thaksin.</p> <p>But when Thaksin and his wife, who were due to appear before the supreme court in Bangkok, failed to return to Thailand arrest warrants were issued and the court ordered the forfeiture of \u00a3195,000 bail bond. The tycoon's son Phantongtae and daughters Pinthongta and Paethontan, also face corruption allegations.</p> <p>In a handwritten statement faxed from London and read on Thai state television, Thaksin, 59, said he travelled to Britain rather than board a flight he had booked to take him back to Bangkok on Sunday. No mention was made of seeking political asylum in Britain. </p> <p>The tycoon, who held office for five years, said he would remain in Britain indefinitely, but hoped that he would be able to return to his homeland one day. \"My wife and I have travelled to reside in England,\" he said in the statement. </p> <p>\"If I still have luck, I would come back to die on Thai soil like every other Thai person. What happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree - the fruit will also be poisoned. </p> <p>\"There is a continuation of dictatorship managing Thai politics ... which is followed by interference in the justice system. These are my political enemies. </p> <p>They do not care about the rule of law, facts or internationally recognised due process,\" he added. Thaksin lived in exile in Britain for two years after he was ousted in a 2006 military coup. He returned to Thailand this year to face corruption charges against him after his political allies won new elections and formed a coalition government. </p> <p>But just five months after returning to a hero's welcome, Thaksin railed against the Thai judicial system that he said was stacked against him, despite his allies in the People Power party winning the election in December.</p> <p>The swift action against the pair yesterday suggested that almost \u00a31bn of Thaksin's assets frozen in Thai bank accounts could be at risk, though he is believed to have significant funds salted away in banks outside the country.</p> <p>Chris Baker, Thaksin's biographer and a political analyst, said of the statement: \"Clearly Thaksin is very angry by the way things have turned out. He is obviously extremely emotional. There's a fighting tone; he's not given up completely.\"</p> <p>But after Pojaman's conviction Baker said the writing was on the wall for the former leader. He said Thaksin did not want to take any chances with the verdict of a corruption case about an allegedly dubious land deal, due in September, because the verdict, for which there would be no appeal, would be decided by the supreme court.</p> <p>The arrival in London of the telecoms tycoon could present the British government with a diplomatic dilemma. Thailand has had an extradition agreement with the UK since a 1911 bilateral treaty. </p> <p>The Thai authorities could apply to have their former prime minister extradited, although it would be a lengthy procedure and one which Thaksin would resist on the grounds that the judiciary were allegedly leading a witch-hunt against him. </p> <p>The legal proceedings also raised questions about the tycoon's ownership of Manchester City football club and what effect his departure may have on his financing of it. </p> <p>Thaksin bought Manchester City for \u00a381.6m during his 17-month exile in the UK. It is thought that the Premier League must now ascertain whether he remains a \"fit and proper person\" to run the club. </p> <p>Fans have also questioned whether the tycoon's latest move and the freezing of his assets could put in jeopardy the funds he had hoped to make available for the purchase of new players. </p> <p>The club, which kicks off its premiership season this weekend, declined to comment on Thaksin's status yesterday.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p><strong>Thaksin Shinawatra</strong>, 59, a former policeman from Chiang Mai who made a <strong>fortune in telecoms</strong>, was the first Thai prime minister to win two terms of office. He went into politics in 1994, becoming foreign minister, and then founded the <strong>Thai Rak Thai</strong> party in 1998.

  "<p>The past is for reference, not for residence; make sure you step up to the mark TODAY. That is my message to every athlete taking part in the Olympic Games. This is what you have been working so hard for, the pinnacle of your career, your do-or-die moment. </p> <p>Do not think your big chance can wait for tomorrow because tomorrow may never come. Just ask Colin Jackson, who was favourite for gold in the 110m hurdles at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 but ended up finishing seventh. People said to him: \"Never mind, Colin, there is always Atlanta in four years' time.\" He made it there but his chance to win a medal had gone.</p> <p>So seize the moment; drink it, LOVE IT. I loved every moment of being an Olympian, especially in Los Angeles in 1984 at my first Games. I had watched the Olympics growing up, like the famous Games in Mexico in 1968, and dreamt of competing on that stage. Then suddenly, in LA, I was there, part of a team packed full of legends like Steve Cram, Steve Ovett and Daley Thompson. I was a bit starry-eyed but I did not lose my focus on the task - I was a soldier and this was my chance to do my country, my club, my coach and my friends and family proud. In those circumstances, people either rise to the occasion or crumble under the pressure and thankfully I rose to take silver in the 4x400m relay.</p> <p>I didn't realise it but the moment I crossed the finish line my life changed forever. Suddenly I was a household name - which is not hard when you're called Akabusi - and a recognisable face practically everywhere I went. Some people find that sort of attention and intrusion difficult to handle but I cherished it. It was great to be stopped in the streets by people who said they had taken inspiration and enjoyment out of seeing me do so well. That is the power the Olympics has, an emotional effect which can be overwhelming at times. I will never forget one person who told me that one of the very last things a relative of theirs had done before passing away was watching me win silver in Los Angeles, and that they had taken great pleasure from that moment. That stills means a lot to me.</p> <p>There is a lasting benefit to being an Olympian. For me it has brought a career in the media and as a motivational speaker which has allowed me to earn a more than decent living for myself and my family. I am recognised in the streets less but it still happens from time to time, mostly by people who want to hear my laugh. That is the other amazing thing about being an Olympian - it creates a window into your life that allows people to discover the most intimate aspects of your personality. I don't think my laugh would have become so renowned had I not won the medals that I did.</p> <p>But it is not just fame and fortune that an athlete can draw from competing at an Olympics; there is also a fantastic social education to be gained. For many it is the first time they have mixed with people from around the world. I had never, for instance, spoken to someone from Vanuatu or Togo until I took part at the Games and by doing so I enhanced my knowledge and understanding of their cultures. You have a similar interaction at other major events, like the World Championships, but it is not as broad and diverse as it is at the Olympics.</p> <p>That is also the case regarding the events. At the World Championships it is just track and field but at the Olympic Games you are exposed to almost every sport around, from boxing to swimming to fencing, and as a result you are able to witness first hand what the body can do in all its different disciplines.</p> <p>It has to be said that once they are at the Olympics, most athletes just focus on their event and what they have to do to succeed. But the really big stories do get around and, from a British point of view, I think this year that could be Mark Foster in the pool. It would be an amazing achievement if he won an Olympic medal at the fifth time of asking, and if he does so he could well inspire others to push themselves further. In that sense, it is great the British team has already collected some medals in Beijing, especially the golds. You don't want the first week to pass by without anything to shout about. </p> <p>It is now up to the rest of the guys to go out and deliver - the time for talking is over and now they have to walk the walk. I speak from experience when I say the Olympics is a unique moment in any athlete's career and one they would be foolish to allow to pass without giving it their best. I won my only gold medal at the World Championships, in Tokyo in 1991, but it is the memories of winning Olympic medals in Los Angeles and Barcelona that mean the most to me. I'm sure it would be the same this year's British team.</p>",
  "<p>Although stand-up comedy today provides a career path to political analysis, sports commentary, or literary fame, the comedian Bernie Mac, who has died aged 50 of complications from pneumonia, followed the more traditional route to television sitcoms and films. What was remarkable was how each genre drew on different aspects of his talents. </p> <p>As a stand-up, he followed the aggressive sharp-witted vulgarity of Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy, but tempered by endearing facial expressions and body-language that recalled older black comics such as Redd Foxx or Pigmeat Markham. His television portrayal of an outwardly threatening foster parent was similarly revealed as bluster beneath a soft surface. In films, his blocky size, mixed with sometimes idiotic humour, as if Jack Carson had been reborn as an ironic Stepin Fetchit, allowed him to steal the three Ocean's films, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, and Bad Santa from their erstwhile stars. His death came just as his success in leading roles had suggested the possibility of major screen stardom.</p> <p>Mac came up the hard way. He was born Bernard McCullough on the south side of Chicago, and raised by his single-parent mother and his grandmother. He chose his career aged five, when he saw his crying mother distracted into laughter by Bill Cosby on TV. His mother died of cancer when he was 16, and he was also predeceased by his brothers, one of whom died in infancy and the other of a heart attack in his 20s. Mac was voted class clown at Chicago Vocational Career Academy, but insisted he was a comedian, not a clown. He drove delivery vans, for Wonder Bread, UPS and others, before getting a job in a General Motors factory, and, at 19, marrying his high school sweetheart Rhonda, a nurse. He worked comedy clubs, and performed in the streets and the Chicago subway. </p> <p>In his 2004 memoir, Maybe You Never Cry Again, he detailed the roots of his comedy. \"I came from a place where there wasn't a lot of joy ... I decided to make other people laugh when there wasn't a lot of things to laugh about.\"</p> <p>In 1983, Mac was made redundant, and diagnosed with sarcoidosis, an immune system disorder that attacks the lungs. In 2005 the disease went into remission. Although his pneumonia was unconnected with the disease, sarcoidosis had likely weakened his lungs. He continued to perform in any available venue, eventually catching the eye of Foxx and his fellow comic Slappy White; they invited him to Las Vegas in 1989. He won a national comedy search in 1990, and from there his rise was meteoric.</p> <p>The Def Comedy Jam, broadcast by HBO in 1990, got him a variety programme, Midnight Mac, and bit parts in films such as Mo' Money (1992), Who's the Man (1993) and Above the Rim (1994). His performance as Pastor Clever in 1995's Friday, starring Ice Cube, led to his being cast in 1996 as Uncle Bernie in the TV sitcom Moesha, on the urban-oriented network UPN. The 1999 Kings of Comedy tour, also broadcast by HBO and turned into a 2000 film by Spike Lee, made him a national figure. </p> <p>In 2001 the Fox network offered Mac his own show, designed to appeal to a wider audience than UPN. He played a comedian who takes in his drug-addicted sister's three children; his blusteringparent created a dysfunctional antithesis of the Cosby show's bland Huxtable family. </p> <p>Although Mac based the situation on real-life friends, he and his wife, parents of a daughter, Je'Niece, had actually taken in his niece and the daughter she had borne aged 16. In the programme he especially battled the teenage niece he called \"the Evil One\", and would turn to the audience to ask questions such as \"tell me why I can't whip that girl\". The fact that Mac's character was a celebrity allowed other famous actors to make guest appearances on the show as themselves, including Halle Berry, Ice Cube and Isaac Hayes.</p> <p>The Bernie Mac Show won an Emmy for the writer Larry Wilmore, and garnered Mac two Emmy nominations for best comedy actor; it also received a prestigious Peabody award for its portrayal of race relations. But it quickly lost its edge, with Mac blaming the network for constantly restraining his team, and was cancelled after five seasons. Meanwhile, he was an egotistical baseball star in Mr 3000 (2004), played the Spencer Tracy role in the race-inverted remake Guess Who (2005) and starred in Pride (2007) about a black swimming team. He had completed a film, Soul Men, about the reunion of a feuding music duo, which will be released later this year; it co-starred Samuel L Jackson and Hayes. In June, Mac performed at a fundraiser for Barack Obama, offending some of the more politically correct audience and drawing a winking rebuke from the candidate, who said: \"Bernie, you've got to clean up your act next time.\"</p> <p>Mac had already announced he would retire, to produce films and enjoy more time with his family. He is survived by his wife and daughter; George Clooney, star of the Ocean's films, said of his death: \"The world just got a little less funny.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bernie Mac (Bernard Jeffrey McCullough), comedian and actor, born October 5 1957; died August 9 2008</p>",

  "<p>In weeks and years past, each of us has argued that Russia was pursuing a policy of regime change <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">toward Georgia</a> and its pro-western, democratically elected president, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/26/AR2006112600953.html\">Mikheil Saakashvili</a>. We predicted that, absent strong and unified western diplomatic involvement, war was coming.<br> Now, tragically, an escalation of violence in South Ossetia has culminated in a full-scale <a href=\"http://www.blogsofwar.com/2008/08/08/video-richard-holbrooke-points-to-russian-aggression-expansion-in-south-ossetian-conflict/\">Russian invasion</a> of Georgia. The west, especially the United States, could have prevented this war. A watershed moment is at hand in the west's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/russia.georgia\">post-cold war relations</a> with Russia. </p> <p>Exactly what happened in South Ossetia last week is unclear. Each side will argue its own version. But we know, without doubt, that Georgia was responding to repeated provocative attacks by South Ossetian separatists controlled and funded by the Kremlin. This is a not a war Georgia wanted; it believed that it was slowly gaining ground in South Ossetia through a strategy of soft power.<br> Whatever mistakes Georgia's government made cannot justify Russia's actions. The Kremlin has invaded a neighbor, an illegal act of aggression that violates the UN charter and fundamental principles of cooperation and security in Europe. </p> <p>Beginning a well-planned war (including cyber-warfare) as the Olympics were opening violates the ancient tradition of a truce to conflict during the games. Russia's willingness to create a war zone 25 miles from the Black Sea city of Sochi, where it is to host the winter games in 2014, hardly demonstrates its commitment to Olympic ideals. In contrast, Russia's timing suggests that Vladimir Putin seeks to overthrow Saakashvili well ahead of the US elections, and thus avoid beginning relations with the next president on an overtly confrontational note.<br> <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4497216.ece\">Russia's goal</a> is not simply, as it claims, restoring the status quo in South Ossetia. It wants regime change in Georgia. It has opened a second front in the other disputed Georgian territory, Abkhazia, just south of Sochi. But its great goal is to replace Saakashvili \u2013 a man Putin despises \u2013 with a president more subject to Kremlin influence. </p> <p>As Swedish foreign minister <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLB18130\">Carl Bildt</a> <a href=\"http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/081008.shtml\">pointed out</a> on Saturday, Moscow's rationale for invading has parallels to the darkest chapters of Europe's history. Having issued passports to tens of thousands of Abkhazians and South Ossetians, Moscow now claims it must intervene to protect them \u2013 a tactic reminiscent of one used by Nazi Germany at the start of the second world war. </p> <p>Russia seeks to roll back democratic breakthroughs on its borders, to destroy any chance of further Nato or EU enlargement and to re-establish a sphere of hegemony <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/10/georgia.russia1\">over its neighbours</a>. By trying to destroy a democratic, pro-western Georgia, Moscow is sending a message that, in its part of the world, being close to America and the west does not pay. </p> <p>This moment could well mark the end of an era in Europe during which realpolitik and spheres of influence were supposed to be replaced by cooperative norms and a country's right to choose its own path. Hopes for a more liberal Russia under President Dmitry Medvedev will need to be reexamined. His justification for this invasion reads more like Brezhnev than Gorbachev. While no one wants a return to cold war-style confrontation, Russia's behavior poses a direct challenge to European and international order. </p> <p>What can the west do? First, Georgia deserves the west's solidarity and support. The west must get the fighting stopped and preserve Georgia's territorial integrity within its current international border. As soon as hostilities cease, there should be a major, coordinated transatlantic effort to help Tbilisi rebuild and recover.<br> Second, we should not pretend that Russia is a neutral peacekeeper in conflicts on its borders. Russia is part of the problem, not the solution. For too long, Moscow has used existing international mandates to pursue neo-imperial policies. The west must disavow these mandates and insist on truly neutral international forces, under the UN, to monitor a future ceasefire and to mediate. </p> <p>Third, the west needs to counter Russian pressure on its neighbours, especially Ukraine \u2013 most likely the next target in Moscow's efforts to create a new sphere of hegemony. The US and the European Union must be clear that Ukraine and Georgia will not be condemned to some kind of grey zone. </p> <p>Finally, the US and the EU must make clear that this kind of aggression will affect relations and Russia's standing in the west. While western military intervention in Georgia is out of the question \u2013 and no one wants a 21st-century version of the cold war \u2013 Russia's actions cannot be ignored. </p> <p>There is a vast array of political, economic and other areas in which Russia's role and standing will have to be reexamined. The Kremlin must also be put on notice that its own prestige project \u2013 the Sochi Olympics \u2013 will be affected by its behavior. </p> <p>Weak western diplomacy and lack of transatlantic unity failed to prevent an avoidable war. Only strong transatlantic unity can stop this war and begin to repair the immense damage done. Otherwise, we can add one more issue to the growing list of the Bush administration's foreign policy failures. </p> <p><em>Ronald Asmus, a deputy assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration, is executive director of the Brussels-based Transatlantic Center of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</em></p>",
  "<p>There wasn't much left of Kostia Asershvili's living room. His chandelier sat in the middle of a glass-strewn carpet. The windows in the children's bedroom had been blown out. </p> <p>Next door had fared worse. Kostia's neighbour was killed when a bomb landed on his roof.</p> <p>Across the road, other blocks of flats in the town of Gori had suffered the same fate: scorched and twisted metal lay in the courtyard, surrounded by clothes, bricks, pillow feathers - and the smell of burnt flesh. </p> <p>\"I was lucky. I got my children out 15 minutes before the bombs fell,\" Kostia said, showing off his wonky door lintels and broken windows. He added: \"I don't know who's to blame for this war. The only thing I know is that it isn't me.\" </p> <p>Ostensibly, the Russian jets that bombed Kostia's house were aiming for a Georgian tank base a couple of miles away. The bombs did not reach their target. </p> <p>Perhaps they weren't meant to. Instead, they landed on a residential district of Gori - the town that has borne the brunt of Russia's vengeful bombardment of Georgia after President Mikhail Saakashvili's unsuccessful attempt last week to seize back the breakaway province of South Ossetia. </p> <p>Georgian tanks rolled into the mountainous enclave, 14 miles away from Gori, last Thursday; on Sunday they withdrew from South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali. Despite having turfed the Georgians out, Russia today continued to bomb targets beyond the conflict zone all across Georgia. </p> <p>With the tiny country's air defences flattened, the Russian air force can now fly insouciantly across Georgian airspace. Georgia yesterday said Russian planes had launched 50 attacks overnight - a claim Moscow denies.</p> <p>Two Russian fighters did lob bombs on to a disused, communist-era aerodrome near the border with Azerbaijan; others hit a radar station in the capital Tbilisi, sending panic-stricken residents fleeing from their beds at dawn, and crippling the international airport. </p> <p>\"It was 5am. We saw the planes loop over the forest. They then released their rockets. There was a huge cloud of dust,\" Fridon Akobia, a 41-year-old border guard on the river crossing into Georgia, said. He added: \"We didn't know where the bombers were going to hit.\" </p> <p>Russia's indiscriminate bombing strategy appears to have no real military objective. Instead it looks like a vindictive post-facto exercise in collective punishment. </p> <p>In Gori, residents returned to examine their homes, wrecked in the weekend bombing. The five-story block across the road from Kostia's was a blackened ruin: the upper stories had disappeared, its neat vine trellis staved in as if by a giant fist. </p> <p>\"We lived on the fifth floor. We fled just before the attack started,\" Nana Tetsladzi, 35, said. Her husband, Giorgy, 35, got out too. But Nana's pregnant neighbour Marca, who lived below on the second floor, wasn't quick enough.</p> <p>\"She and her husband were both killed. I don't know what happened to their seven-year-old boy,\" she said. \"He may be in hospital.\" In the courtyard were the mangled remains of Marca's white car. She had been trying to flee in it when the Russians struck.</p> <p>Nana opened up her garage to show off her surviving possessions: a dust-covered television set, blankets, and a rack of glass jars. \"This is all we have left,\" she said, tearfully.</p> <p>Most inhabitants of Gori have fled. Some clearly left in a hurry: down one sidestreet, someone had left a generously sized red bra hanging in the front garden. A few bakeries remained open today, churning out loaves of delicious round bread. Most of the town is undamaged; its shops and bombed market are shut. </p> <p>In the afternoon a fleet of ambulances drove past Gori's main square - adorned with a statue of Stalin, who was born here. Among those who stayed, the mood was anger, directed not just at neighbouring Russia but also at the west, which, they said, had failed spectacularly to help Georgia in its moment of need. </p> <p>\"If Europe and the US don't stop Russia, in 20 years time you'll see a new wall going up in Berlin,\" Paata Aspanadze - who had driven to Gori to visit his elderly mother - warned. \"Russia wants to get back its empire. Today they kill us and my family; tomorrow they will kill you.\" </p> <p>Paata did not agree that Saakashvili's attempt to reclaim South Ossetia was, as many have suggested, a reckless and ill-thought-out gamble bound to provoke Russia's wrath. Instead, he painted Georgia's conflict with Russia as nothing less than a struggle for survival. </p> <p>\"If we say to Russia, 'OK, have two bits of Georgia,' then Georgia's independence will be finished,' he said. </p> <p>Others decried Russia's hypocrisy, for encouraging separatism in Georgia while ruthlessly crushing it in next-door Chechnya, the scene of two brutal Kremlin wars. </p> <p>\"Russia is completely to blame. Georgia is an independent, sovereign country. They are just trying to grab our land,\" Paata's brother Nukri said during a family reunion over fizzy Georgian juice at his mother's upstairs flat. </p> <p>\"Why is the world not doing anything? Russia is using the same excuse, of protecting its citizens, that Hitler used in 1939.\" </p> <p>It is so far not yet clear what impact this crisis will have on the political fortunes of Saakashviili, Georgia's pro-US leader. Moscow has demanded that he step down, accusing him of genocide and other crimes.</p> <p>Nobody doubts that the conflict has set back Georgia's attempt to join Nato by years, if not decades. At the same time, Georgia is more isolated than ever before. The country's international airport is scarcely operational: to reach Georgia, you have to fly via Armenia or Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. A bumpy, if picturesque, 10-hour car journey then threads through wine-growing eastern Georgia, past horse-drawn carts transporting melons through fields of yellow sunflowers. </p> <p>But the abiding emotion in Georgia at the moment is fear \u2013 fear of where the Russian jets may strike on their next languid bombing run.</p> <p>\"People are scared,\" said Lika Teravze, a parliamentary researcher in Tbilisi. \"Russian bombers woke us at 4.50am this morning. We ran out into the street to see what the noise was. We were looking into the sky wondering where the bombs would fall.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you watch the footage of the prime minister's recent surprise <a href=\"http://www.theedinburghblog.co.uk/edinburgh-festivals/gordon-brown-ian-rankin-at-the-book-festival-opening/08-10-2008/index.html\">appearance</a> at the Edinburgh book festival you will see something remarkable. You will see a man who seems relaxed, human and even sincere, in a way that Tony Blair never once managed in 10 years. A man who even manages a couple of fairly amusing jokes. You will see, in short, the side of Gordon Brown which his supporters have been talking up for years but which we, the public, have never yet caught sight of. </p> <p>What was it about Edinburgh that seemed to transform the man? It seems to me that there are two possible answers. One: he wasn't talking about politics. He wasn't being asked about David Miliband or the economy's continuing journey down the toilet. He was talking about books \u2013 more specifically his own books which, as any writer will tell you, is always guaranteed to cheer you up, especially if people have paid to come and hear you do it.</p> <p>But there's a second possibility: in Edinburgh, Gordon Brown may have felt at home. Ensconced in the Scottish capital, not too far from his own <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/gordon_brown/kirkcaldy_and_cowdenbeath\">constituency</a>, being interviewed by fellow Scottish writer Ian Rankin, the PM was on his own turf. Could it be that, once he scoots south across the border, Brown feels he doesn't really belong?</p> <p>This might explain his continuing obsession with \"Britishness\". Talking to Rankin, Brown revealed that he is putting together a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1043371/Gordon-Browns-latest-book-project-British-through.html\">book</a> on the subject, to be published next year. You might think the PM should have more important things to do \u2013 saving the economy, the Labour party or his career, for example \u2013 but apparently not. Britishness trumps the lot.</p> <p>We've been here before. About the only coherent theme to Brown's tenure in the job so far has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/30/northfendingofftheenglish\">Britishness</a>: it helps explain to an increasingly disgruntled middle England that this heavily Scottish government is on their side. After all, we're all British, right? We all share the same '\"values\".</p> <p>Except that, increasingly, we don't. Scotland, since devolution, looks like a very different country to England: it may soon formally become one. Wales is discovering a new political and cultural self-confidence. Northern Ireland is governing itself with a degree of certainty that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. </p> <p>Meanwhile the English are discovering, belatedly, what it feels like to be politically marginalised. Currently the only British nation without a parliament or government, and with Scottish and Welsh MPs merrily making its laws while English MPs are barred from many matters beyond their border, England has fewer MPs per head of population than the other UK nations and receives less money from the Treasury per capita too. The prime minister can barely even bring himself to mention the place by name: he'll happily talk of Scotland and Wales, but when referring to England he speaks of \"our country\" or, if he's in a particularly bad mood, \"the regions\". Consequently, English <a href=\"http://www.toque.co.uk/witan/poll/\">dissatisfaction</a> with the current UK settlement is growing.</p> <p>Add this all together and you get a shaky future for the UK. Our political classes know this, and they don't like it. Their jobs and their party bases depend on the union. This is what drives Brown's \"Britishness\" agenda \u2013 and will doubtless drive that of David Cameron should he become PM.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the public is less keen. Britishness is becoming an establishment project: a state-approved identity. Meanwhile, the populations of Britain are rediscovering their pre-UK identities: Scottish, Welsh, English, even Cornish. Ask Brown what those mythical \"British values\" are and he will tell you proudly: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jul/08/britishidentity.economy\">liberty, tolerance, fair play</a>. Universal values, in other words. By touting them, the PM achieves the opposite of what he intends: he demonstrates that his version of Britishness means very little. </p> <p>But Brown cannot acknowledge this. His position is shaky enough as it is, without giving ground to those who question the very basis of the state he governs. Expect, then, to hear a lot more about Britishness in the coming months. At least until the PM is shown the red card and is free to spend more time in Kircaldy, writing books and allowing himself to relax again.</p>",
  "<p>There is not a single rider in the Olympic three-day event, after the gruelling cross-country stage at the Beas River country club, who can be certain when they enter the showjumping arena for the third and final test that their horse will have the energy or the required discipline to respond.</p> <p>For although it was generally agreed that the weather had been kind, and that the 4,560m helter-skelter cross-country course, with its 29 obstacles, had not been the ride of death that many had feared, and although nobody made it inside the eight-minute time limit, there were nevertheless an awful lot of extremely tired horses in the stables afterwards. They had less than 24 hours to recover before this afternoon's (evening here) d\u00e9nouement, and any residual stiffness can so easily be translated into the horrible clattering of fences.</p> <p>Britain, third overall in the team competition and with Mary King, the 47-year-old mother of two, in joint fifth place individually, left the mountains and returned to the river estuary of Sha Tin with a good deal to look forward to. Yogi Breisner, the British team manager, is a naturally optimistic character, and was by no means ruling out the possibility of turning team bronze into silver, or even gold.</p> <p>The last time Britain won Olympic team gold was at the 1972 Munich Games when Richard Meade established himself as one of the all-time great Olympians, winning team and individual gold to add to his team gold in Mexico City four years earlier. After the cross-country here Germany and Australia had a half grip on the gold and silver respectively, though the memory of the Athens Games brought a sparkle of hope to Breisner's eyes.</p> <p>It was there, on an evening of sustained pandemonium, that Germany's Bettina Hoy rode a seemingly flawless round, only to be penalised for crossing the starting line twice. An appeal rescinded that penalty, and Hoy left Athens with the team and individual gold medals. Then, three days later, the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned Germany's appeal, leaving Hoy and her team-mates without any medals whatsoever.</p> <p>To say they were on a mission here would be something of an understatement in Olympic terms. In Athens, Britain was bumped up from bronze to silver in the team event while Leslie Law, who now lives and works in the US, became the unlikely individual gold medal winner, and arguably one of the most quickly forgotten British Olympic champions.</p> <p>So nothing can be taken for granted. These are not the huge fences that will confront the specialist show-jumpers later this week. They are designed to test that the horse is sound and the riders still have their wits about them. \"All our riders are good jumpers, so it will be very interesting. I think the pressure will be on the Germans and the Australians,\" said Breisner. Without a doubt nerves will be on edge, while it was noticeable last week that several horses were spooked inside the spacious dressage arena where the jumps will be placed.</p> <p>William Fox-Pitt, whose horse went lame at this stage in Athens, rode one of the best cross-country rounds of the day on Parkmore Ed, and clearly deeply regretted not having performed to his usual high standard in the dressage, for otherwise he might have been in gold medal contention.</p> <p>Matters rarely go to plan in eventing, none more so than for Australia's British-born Lucinda Fredericks who had lead after the dressage and whose relatively small horse, Headley Britannia, had been expected to waltz around the course. \"It did not ride as I expected and I was probably a bit too cautious,\" she said, dropping from first to 11th.</p> <p>Fredericks coaches the Etonian-educated Alex Hua Tian, China's only representative, who fell heavily early on, much to the fury of its rider who blamed himself totally, and on rising to his feet might have sworn in any one of the five languages that he speaks - French, Mandarin, Russian, English and Latin. But he is still only 18 years old, and should do well in future Olympics, assuming he isn't lured into David Cameron's Etonian coterie.</p>",

  "<p>Mortified by events in Sweden yesterday, when he was stuck with a two-week ban for failing a breath test, Seb Sanders is sure to be on his mettle at Wolverhampton today. It's an extraordinary thing to have happened to Sanders, whose reputation as a focused professional is well established, and I feel sorry for him. I can't imagine what kind of dressing-down he'll get from Sir Mark Prescott, who sent him to Jagersro for two mounts, including one that was well beaten in the valuable Swedish Derby under a substitute rider.</p> <p>Like every runner Mark Johnston sends out, Sanders is always trying but I'd bet he'll be even sharper than usual today and he should certainly score on Elegant Cad in the first at Wolves -- John Best's runner is currently 1-2.</p> <p>Of more interest from a betting perspective is <strong>Wisdom's Kiss (4.00)</strong>, still on offer at 11-2 despite heading the market for the competitive 7f handicap on the same card. All three of this one's wins have been on Polytrack, so I can readily forgive his poor effort on turf last time. He'd won his two previous starts and, with trainer James Bethell in form, his claims are a lot more solid than those of his rivals.</p> <p>I didn't find Southwell's jumps card nearly as appealing as I'd expected -- you know that feeling, when you go through every runner in a race and can't find a convincing case why any of them should run well? I had that with three or four of these races.</p> <p>Still, <strong>Sonic Anthem (4.45)</strong> shouldn't be 15-2 for the last, a handicap hurdle. The six-year-old was upsides when falling at the final flight at Uttoxeter in May and then battled to a narrow victory at Stratford last month. Sure, you could argue that the 7lb extra he has today would have stopped him winning that day, but that seems over-literal to me -- in these low-quality jump races, a bit of will to win goes a long way and this one has it. Trainer John Stimpson has sent out eight winners from 29 runners, Flat and jumps, since the start of June.</p> <p>Tim Vaughan, another trainer in form, has a couple of obvious chances today but his unfancied <strong>Withington (2.45)</strong> is also worth a look in the novice chase. This is a weak contest and I'm keen to take on Alan King's Zilcash, who won his first two over fences but has been well beaten twice since and it looks to me as though he doesn't fancy the larger obstacles.</p> <p>The nine-year-old Withington struggled to score in point-to-points but won a beginners' chase on his debut under Rules for Vaughan in June and can be forgiven for being taken off his feet in a hurdles race round Cartmel last time. He's big at 16-1.</p> <p>Since he started training last year, Ollie Pears has kept up a 17% strike-rate, which means his horses win about twice as often as those of, say, Mick Channon, and all his runners are worth a look. <strong>Lujano (6.30)</strong> returns to the course and distance over which he won a selling handicap last time, when the step up to this trip clearly suited him. Soft ground shouldn't be a problem and I'd make him favourite, whereas you can get almost 5-1.</p> <p><strong>Anduril (6.00)</strong> has twice been second from three attempts in big-field handicaps round here and, at 16-1 or thereabouts, he'd be the each-way value in the opener.</p> <p>Neither Ed McMahon nor his father, Bryan, can have entered many in the Derby over the years so the Lichfield team must think highly of <strong>Norwegian Dancer (7.00)</strong>, who makes his debut in the 7f maiden. He looks like being second-favourite and is probably worth an interest, since the experienced runners here have achieved very little so far. McMahon Jnr does a great job with his juveniles -- from 24 starts this year, he's had six winners and only four (4!) out of the frame. Astonishing.</p> <p><strong>2.25pm Soft fences at Southwell</strong></p> <p>Mick Fitzgerald, who looks very comfortable in his new role on't telly, was talking earlier about how \"well-presented\" Southwell's fences are. According to Mick, they used to be pretty fearsome. Well, those days are long gone. It seems to me you can run through these fences and Tony McCoy's mount in the first, Granite Man, did more or less that, yet came within a neck of winning anyway.</p> <p><strong>2.35 He gets knocked down, but he gets up again . . .</strong></p> <p>Seb Sanders drives Elegant Cad (4-11) home in a photo-finish at Wolves, having looked beat when Layer Cake and Eddie Ahern went past in the final furlong. That will have redeemed him, as far as favourite-backers are concerned anyway. One or two of those who like to lump on the good things may even be calling for a knighthood.</p> <p><strong>2.50pm Zilcash, Withington stuffed</strong></p> <p>It was a good idea to take on Zilcash, who jumped with no confidence and seemed to be hating every second of that, but Withington was a bum tip -- from an early stage, he was clearly going to take no part in the finish. Ballybough Jack (11-2) was an easy winner in the end for jockey Christian Williams and the superbly named trainer Lawney (short for Trelawney -- a woman's name, apparently) Hill.</p> <p><strong>4pm Wisdom's Kiss wins at 6-1</strong></p> <p>Jimmy Quinn has never been one of my favourite jockeys and I have to admit I was calling him all sorts after he missed the kick and settled in last place there. But he steered Wisdom's Kiss through as the gaps came for them and they won handily in the end.</p> <p>Another profit on the day for all those followers of Talking Horses -- and there's still four tips to go!</p> <p><strong>5pm Sonic Anthem outclassed</strong></p> <p>A good effort from Sonic Anthem, who made most of the running and was eventually second at 13-2 but Divine Gift (9-1) swept past and won handsomely. Noel Chance's charge had been disappointing on his last few starts but hasn't been seen for a while and maybe this canny trainer has found the key to him. He'll certainly be worth a look next time.</p> <p><strong>5.30pm Hi fetlocks</strong></p> <p>Fondmort was last heard of enjoying retirement with his owners, Bill and Tracy Brown. He made a more or less complete recovery from the fractured hip that nearly killed him 20-odd months ago and was certainly well enough to parade at the Lambourn open day in spring.</p> <p>Good luck with Young Dottie -- the only one I could have fancied in that race is a non-runner.</p> <p><strong>6.10pm Anduril third of 16 at 16-1</strong></p> <p>\"The each-way value,\" said Talking Horses, and it was so. That's Anduril's third time in the frame over this track and trip in a big field, from four attempts. Still, it'd be nice if he'd actually win one of these races. This time, he went down by just a neck and a head.</p> <p><strong>7.05pm Norwegian Dancer doesn't look like a Derby winner</strong></p> <p>Ed McMahon's newcomer travelled best of all for a long way and was backed at 1-4 on Betfair when hitting the front in the straight but faded, partly through running green and partly, I suspect, because he'd run out of puff after going a good pace on soft ground. It's a disappointing end to the day after Lujain's flop in the previous race.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"http://guardian.sportinglife.com/GU_Meetings\">here</a> for all the day's racecards, form, stats and results.</p> <p>And click <a href=\"http://guardian.oddschecker.com\">here</a> for today's latest odds.</p>",
  "<p>Kyle Busch made history at Watkins Glen yesterday by becoming the first Nascar driver to win three road course races in a season.</p> <p>Points leader Busch took pole position for the Sprint Cup race in adverse conditions but conceded the lead to Dale Earnhardt Jr on the opening lap. However a strong strategy helped him return to the head of the field, where he battled with his Joe Gibbs Racing team-mate Tony Stewart, fending him off after a restart with four laps to go.</p> <p>Busch crossed the line first to set the new record for road course wins, having already taken a Sprint Cup victory at Infineon Raceway and a Nationwide win at Mexico City this year. Stewart, who was named driver of the decade at the Watkins Glen track, finished second ahead of Marcos Ambrose.</p> <p>\"We've got to thank the good Lord for raining down on us on Friday \u2013 that made it easy,\" said Busch. \"It's just fun to be able to race on a road course because I enjoy being able to do it and, fortunately, now I'm not too shabby at it. I knew Tony was going to be good. I knew that I had to get a good restart, and then I knew getting down into turn one I had to get far enough where he wasn't going to run on me. That's probably where our race was won, just on that restart.\"</p> <p>Busch, who will be the top seed in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, confirmed he is due to test a Toyota formula one car later in the year.</p>",
  "<p>This credit crunch business is no fun at all - the cutbacks, the saving, the generally having no fun and not being able to afford to go down the pub. It's worse than being a student. And then, just to really top things off, there are the annoying people who spout non-stop thrifty advice without pausing for one second to see if you need it.</p> <p>These are the kind of people who take one look at your shopping bags and issue a sharp intake of breath. Shop-bought pies? High-street clothes? Spray bottles of cleaning stuff? Why are you buying those when you could make them for a fraction of the price?</p> <p>Well, maybe in the olden days. But does that really hold true now? Are thousands of convenience addicts just a few money-saving tips away from beating the credit crunch? Can making my own chicken pie really be the answer to all my financial needs?</p> <p>Certainly, we buy many more things ready prepared now than we ever have before. \"Demands on time have got tougher and more people are in the workforce,\" says Jonathan Schroeder, professor of marketing at the University of Exeter. \"The idea is that convenience products will save us time so we can have time for social activities or seeing the people we want to.\"</p> <p>On this basis, you might expect buying something ready-made to be more expensive than doing it yourself - if you are saving your time, you are presumably paying for someone else's. And there are some products that definitely fall into this category: ready-sliced green beans, for instance, will always be more expensive than whole ones. Which in turn, of course, are more expensive than growing your own. But how will the chicken pie fare?</p> <h2>Fowl play</h2> <p>I don't grow my own chickens, so I hop off to the supermarket (yes, I know the market would have been cheaper, but it shuts before I even leave work). Sainsbury's family chicken pie retails at \u00a32.35 and feeds three to four. Having rifled through Nigella and found a pretty straightforward chicken pie recipe, I start assembling ingredients. The basket fills up to the tune of \u00a310.09 - plain flour, 44p; butter, 85p; milk, 80p; frozen peas, \u00a31.06; free-range chicken breasts, \u00a34.68; cooked ham, \u00a32.26. So much for being thrifty.</p> <p>Back home, I start cooking. And continue cooking. Even with some hardcore multitasking it still takes more than an hour before the pie goes in the oven. Granted, one doesn't have pie all the time - it's a jolly treat for weekend lunch, perhaps (and considering the amount of butter Nigella has me adding, a good job too), but it's a significant time investment.</p> <p>There's also the problem of my bomb-site kitchen to tackle. Time to test how well a home-made kitchen cleaner performs. Out goes the Ecover squirty stuff at \u00a31.98 for 500ml, and in comes the vinegar, soda crystals, bicarbonate of soda and lemons. The cost? \u00a32.05. A few pence more but a great deal more cleaning kit bought - enough to do probably twice the area of the shop-bought bottle. That's almost half price. If it works.</p> <p>Which, surprisingly, it does. You need to put in a bit more effort, but the cleaning doesn't take any longer, and the wild fizzing of vinegar and bicarb is a welcome distraction from the scrubbing. The sink gleams like never before. Thrifty and effective. I sink into a smug glow that is made all the more self-satisfied by the emergence of my pie from the oven.</p> <p>Admittedly, it cost more than four times the price of a ready-made shop pie. But, while my splurging on ingredients hasn't made me any better off, it has made my pie a great deal more delicious. And, in fact, enormous. There's far more pie than in the shop-bought version - enough to feed at least eight - and it's about 900% better quality (there isn't any palm oil in there for a start, nor any vegetable concentrate).</p> <p>Of course, if I was a truly thrifty cook my costs for this pie would have been different. I bought all the ingredients from scratch - to properly save money I would have used leftover meat from a roast earlier in the week, and my flour, milk and eggs would have been cheaper because I'd have bought them in larger quantities. I'd also have reduced the time I spent on the project by making several pastry-based dishes at the same time. Maybe you can make a decent quality chicken pie for less than \u00a32.35, but only if you plan properly.</p> <h2>Time tariff</h2> <p>Which is where I play my trump card (of sorts). Because, actually, I'm already into sewing. I have two machines, a load of thread and a stash of material. Running up a quick t-shirt? Surely I can do it for less money than it would cost to buy it. Except, well, maybe not. The price of clothes on the high street has, thanks mainly to Primark and the supermarkets, actually fallen.</p> <p>Even though I'm only paying \u00a34.50 for my fabric, once you take into account the cost of making a mock-up (or buying a pattern), and a percentage of the costs of my machines, threads and sundries, you can still buy tops more cheaply. Mine might not unravel at the hem on its first wear, but it also took several hours of my time to make.</p> <p>And this brings us to the crunch question: how do I price my spare time? Of my three potentially thrifty enterprises, only making my own cleaning products cost less and didn't take up any extra time. Both the pie and the t-shirt, while being better quality than many ready-made counterparts, cost considerably more and involved me putting in some graft.</p> <p>So how much is my free time worth? Not so much that I mind taking 15 minutes to whizz up a big batch of hummus or make a couscous salad to take for lunch. But enough to take pastry making off my to-do list except for on special occasions, and save the sewing for things that are out of the ordinary.</p> <p>Which doesn't mean I'll stop cooking or stitching. Because it's not all about the money - if it was I could spend those extra hours working part time in a bar rather than trying to shave a few pence off the cost of a supermarket chicken pie. Certainly, my bank account would be in better shape if I did.</p>",
  "<p>Whether team GB hits its target of bringing home 41 medals from the Olympic games will depend on more than just the talent and hard work of the athletes. Winning at the top level also means having the most advanced kit and the best training strategies.</p> <p>In the run-up to the games ministers were keen to point out that the government had put far more money into elite sport compared with previous Olympics. Since 2004, top athletes and their coaches have received \u00a3265m, compared with \u00a384m ahead of the Athens games and \u00a363m before Sydney.</p> <p>Whether that will translate into more medals remains to be seen, but much of this money has gone into developing new technologies that should give British athletes the edge over the competition.</p> <h2>Training</h2> <p>Competitors will be eyeing up their rivals for advances in the equipment they use \u2013 more aerodynamic bikes, more powerful kayak paddles and the like. But many of the technological advantages will be invisible once the events start. </p> <p>\"The biggest gains are certainly in the training period,\" said Dr Scott Drawer, research and innovation consultant with UK Sport. He has been funding university scientists and companies to develop technologies that will allow coaches to assess the performance of their athletes more accurately and more quickly so that they can give more effective feedback. \"Developing measurement technologies to understand how people perform is an absolutely fundamental part of coaching,\" he said.</p> <p>His researchers have borrowed innovations from Formula One, aircraft design and the defence industry and have made a particular impact in kayaking, rowing and sailing. For example they have fitted miniature sensors to kayak paddles and rowing blades to measure the force applied in each stroke. That information can be combined with accurate data on the boat's speed from a GPS sensor.</p> <p>\"By putting all those sensors together you get a really accurate picture of how an individual is performing. You can then relay that information in real time to a coach ... and they can see, for example, what the athlete is doing and how they can change their technique,\" said Drawer. Much of the innovation has come in the software to combine the information in real time.</p> <h2>Diving</h2> <p>Another sport where new training aids could make a difference is diving. Previously, competitors practised new, more complicated dives over a trampoline. But the step up to doing it for real in the pool was a large one. Getting a new dive wrong could result in a belly-flop and a serious injury.</p> <p>To prevent this, researchers have developed a harness worn by the diver that is attached to the ceiling of the training pool. The harness gives them the freedom to perform twists and somersaults, but by holding the other end of the ropes the coach can control the diver's descent and slow them down if necessary. The harnesses have been used at elite diving centres in Sheffield, Southampton, Plymouth and Leeds.</p> <p>The harnesses were built by Dr Dave Richards, team leader in engineering design at Fraser Nash Consultancy. He said the device helps the athlete learn the feel of the dive more safely. \"It's for when you are first learning and you are trying to visualise what you are going to see,\" he said. \"It is to help the athlete learn orientation as they are doing the dive.\"</p> <p>The difficult part was fitting the harnesses. \"The challenge for us was putting them up in swimming pools that weren't designed to take them,\" he said. That meant using corrosion-proof, lightweight materials.</p> <h2>Heat adaptation</h2> <p>Although Beijing's 32C to 33C is positively balmy compared with the raging heat of Athens, adapting to the conditions is vital for athletes in every event. More difficult to deal with at these games is the 70% humidity which means that the body's natural mechanism of evaporative cooling via sweating is less effective. </p> <p>\"We are looking at other ways other than evaporative heat loss to remove heat from the body,\" said Prof Mike Tipton, an expert in human physiology at the University of Portsmouth who has been working with the Olympic team. </p> <p>At its most trivial this means pre-cooling kit, for example the protective clothing that fencing competitors wear during a bout, by putting it in a freezer. Other strategies include ice vests, cold hand baths and clothing containing cooled water or glycol. Another strategy is to help athletes acclimatise to the heat in advance by training in an environment that mimics the heat and humidity they will experience on the big day.</p> <p>Improvements in one aspect of a sport, for example reducing drag by changing the shape of a cycling helmet, might cause other problems, perhaps because the new design retains more heat. </p> <p>\"The aerodynamics, particularly in the cycling events and triathlon events, can make quite a significant difference to the amount of effort that's expended,\" said Tipton, \"but if the cost of that is that body temperature reaches the level at which heat exhaustion is likely then it is not a trade-off you are going to accept.\" Tipton has been involved in assessing other new equipment to check it will not affect the athletes' physiological performance.</p> <h2>Cycling</h2> <p>Team GB hopes to boost its cycling performance from the four medals won in Athens to six this time around. Most of the innovations to the bikes are top secret to stop other teams copying them. Only the competitors and a small group of engineers and scientists \u2013 whom Drawer calls the \"secret squirrels\" \u2013 know what they are.</p> <p>One training aid that has been revealed, though, is a more sophisticated cycling simulator or \"ergometer\" that can be more easily tailored to different cyclists to give a realistic ride while remaining stationary in the lab or in the training room. \"It is very adjustable to different people, but it also much better mimics the track cycling event,\" said Richards.</p> <p>The innovation was to include a large flywheel with a fan in it that mimics the change in resistance that a cyclist experiences during acceleration. Because the ergometer always reacts in the same way \u2013 unlike cycling on the track which might be affected by different air pressure or temperature \u2013 the cyclist and coach can accurately compare the effect of different training regimes or acceleration strategies.</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday August 12 2008. We meant to accredit Dr Scott Drawer to UK Sport, not Sport England. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>When I was a history student in the sixties some lecturer assured us that all the European empires of the modern era were crumbling fast with the exception of the two which had expanded across land, not sea: Russia and the United States.</p> <p>Leaving aside the reasonable speculation that the Chinese flag may one day fly over Hawaii, things haven't quite turned out that way for Russia, have they?</p> <p>To my great astonishment the Tsarist/Soviet empire fell rapidly apart after 1989. When Georgia seceded from the Soviet Union in the remarkable year of 1991 it was only the sixth item on the BBC TV evening news - itself a remarkable fact.</p> <p>What should the west do now that <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia7\">Russia is reasserting its revived power</a> on the periphery of its core state, the so-called \"near abroad\"? Reading the weekend press there is a pleasing - do I mean alarming? - disparity of views.</p> <p>The Telegraph flexes its cold war muscles and sounds hawkish. The Mail and Times chide the American-educated <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili \">Mikhail Saakashvili</a>, \"Rose Revolution\" president of Georgia since 2003, for his reckless belief that he could reassert his authority over South Ossetia without provoking the kind of Russian response we are now watching from afar.</p> <p>Did Moscow lure the excitable Saakashvili (he has been on the news channels a lot since Friday) into a trap, whereby it could consolidate its hold on South Ossetia and the other pro-Russian enclave of Abkhazia? Or was the Georgian advance a half-baked shambles in which Saakashvili had actually hoped to be at the Olympics like everyone else (except Gordon)? </p> <p>Today's Guardian runs a mix of opinion. <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia4 \">Jonathan Steele</a>, a specialist in this field for 40 years, dismisses the oil pipeline dimension as marginal (I'm inclined to agree, as I was over Iraq's oil) and puts the dispute in the wider context of US-led western efforts to reduce Russian influence throughout the region.</p> <p>Jonathan blames the \"hot-headed\" Saakashvili for over-reaching himself and thinking he has more claims on Nato and the EU's support in this far border corner of Europe and Asia than is warranted. Even George Bush urged \"peaceful resolution\" of Georgia's historic conflicts when he popped up in Tbilisi.</p> <p>Further into the paper, <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/russia.georgia\">David Clark</a>, a former adviser to Robin Cook, tilts the other way. Whatever his faults Saakashvili is no Milosevic (that's true) and deserves some diplomatic support. The west should sanction Putin's Russia - it's still Putin's, isn't it ? - if it tries to annexe sovereign territory, for instance by asking the IOC to reconsider nearby Sochi as a suitable base for the winter Olympics of 2014.</p> <p>The way I read <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia \">the paper's editorial</a>, it is more Steele than Clark. Russia has lost whatever moral high ground it had by bombing civilians and frightened its other \"near abroad\" neighbours, notably Ukraine, which has been squabbling with Moscow too and is well-placed to make trouble for the Russian Black Sea fleet if it is deployed.</p> <p>But the big loser is Saakashvili, whose EU critics - notably France and Germany - will now say they were right to resist UK-supported US pressure to admit Georgia to Nato and the EU. He speaks perfect English and, even making allowances for stress, I've learned not to trust all he says in the past few days.</p> <p>Myself, I've always had some sympathy with Russian complaints about being \"encircled\" by the US as Nato and the EU expanded into the former Soviet bloc. Eastern Europe, OK, those states were part of a Europe divided by the settlement of 1945. No one recognised the 1940 Soviet annexation of the Baltic states. </p> <p>But Russia's southern flank - the so-called \"stans\" - you could see why they felt humiliated and nervous. All that stuff about missile bases to cover Iran from Poland and the Czech Republic, oh really? </p> <p>On the other hand, neither camp in Fleet Street seems to dispute that the Russians have been stirring it up in the two enclaves for several years, moving in troops, shooting down drones and worse. So I am disinclined to see Russia and its Ossetian allies as mere victims of a foolish move from Tbilisi - Joe Stalin's birthplace, incidentally, in case anyone forgot.</p> <p>Will the Russians merely uphold the status quo, now the Georgians are pulling back? Will they organise a breakaway plebiscite, again using the anti-Serb, anti-Slav precedent of Kosovo since 1998 as their justification? Will they seek to use the inevitable backlash at home against Saakashvili to replace him with a more obliging local? </p> <p>What would the Yanks have done in their backyard, in Mexico or - more recently - in Haiti or (failed) Venezuela? It's worth asking, though it's also fair pointing out that abuses by US-backed states, Israel for example, get young westerners out on the streets in protest faster than abuses out of Asia. Think Lebanon, August 2006.</p> <p>My hunch is that, in its present assertive mood Moscow will risk pushing hard, not least to remind the west not to push too hard the other way. As in most such disputes - Iraq included - a mixture of motives, local and global, are in play. No one wants to miscalculate, this being the sort of crisis where \"Sarajevo 1914\" is more often invoked than \"Munich 1938\".</p> <p>But it's risky. Everyone feels nervous and a bit threatened. China's pyrotechnic Olympic opening ceremony - against which the Ossetian drama unfolded, confusingly at times (are they fireworks or rockets on TV?) - will not have made Moscow or Washington feel very relaxed this August. They have seen the future - and it works, at least when it comes to mass mobilisation.</p> <p>Many people seem to have adored the Beijing ceremony. I found it a bit scary, the sheer scale of it looking more like CGI images (those drummers?) than real-life Chinese at several points. By unhappy coincidence it all came in the week <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn\">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a> died which prompted the Economist to lecture us all - Russians, Chinese, liberal westerners - against being complacent towards tyranny.</p> <p>Where are the new generation of Solzhenitsyns among Russia's famed intelligentsia, it asked? Bought off by privileges, the comforts of revived nationalism and by flattery (so was Solzhenitsyn towards the end), it suggests. Ditto in China where new-found opportunities for free speech have not generated a more liberal regime. Is that fair? Several weekend reports suggest internal criticism of the vulgarity, chauvinism and cost of Friday's ceremony in the Bird's Nest stadium. Good.</p> <p>As for us, our collective willingness to speak truth to power against authoritarianism and abuse seems to atrophy gently as its moral clarity erodes. The product of affluence, the decline of a shared moral or religious code? Or am I being too pessimistic?</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's embattled president, Pervez Musharraf, faced a direct challenge from al-Qaida today, with the terror group lambasting his record in a new video. </p> <p>A person said to be the al-Qaida deputy leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, spoke in English on the tape, calling for an uprising not only against Musharraf but the Pakistani state, which he said was \"virtually ruled from the American embassy\". </p> <p>Pakistan's parliament meets today at the start of a special session for impeachment proceedings against Musharraf. The government has not yet released its charge sheet against the president but al-Qaida spelled out its grievances in the tape. </p> <p>\"Pervez has insulted and compromised Pakistan's sovereignty by allowing the CIA and FBI to operate freely in Pakistan and arrest, interrogate, torture, deport and detain any person, whether Pakistani or not, for as long as they like, thus turning the Pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade,\" said Zawahiri. </p> <p>Zawahiri denounced Musharraf in particular for the crackdown he ordered on Islamabad's radical Red Mosque - the army raid last year resulted in around 100 deaths - and his treatment of the renegade Pakistani nuclear scientist Dr AQ Khan, who has been under house arrest for four years. </p> <p>The hatred of Musharraf among extremists demonstrates how dangerous it would be for him to remain in Pakistan after leaving office, when he would presumably lose his large security detail.</p> <p>The authenticity of the recording, delivered to a Pakistani news channel over the weekend, could not be immediately verified. Zawahiri said he was speaking in English to directly appeal to the people of Pakistan, regretting that he did not know Urdu, the national language. </p> <p>There were suggestions in the Pakistani media that the video had been fabricated by Musharraf's aides to boost public opinion in his favour, just as an al-Qaida video on the eve of the last US presidential election appeared to help George Bush's standing. However, IntelCenter, a US company that monitors militant messages, seemed to be treating it as genuine.</p> <p>The message was much broader than just an attack on Musharraf, calling for jihad against the Pakistani state, including the current government, and especially the country's military. The army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, was singled out as a \"hostile enemy of Islam\". </p> <p>\"Let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in Pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the White House, and are working to destabilise this nuclear-capable nation under the aegis of America,\" said Zawahiri. </p> <p>Musharraf shows no signs of resigning after the coalition last week announced it would try to impeach him. Parliament would need to muster a two-thirds majority to do so, and the numbers look close. </p> <p>The country's four provincial assemblies will from today be passing resolutions against Musharraf. The national parliament will start to meet today but the charges against the president are still to be announced and the process is set to continue into next week. </p> <p>In a weekend military offensive in the Bajur region, an insurgent stronghold near the Afghan border considered a possible hiding place for al-Qaida leaders, Pakistani forces bombed dozens of houses, killing at least 100 insurgents and nine paramilitary troops, according to witnesses. </p> <p>Details are scarce about the offensive, but Sardar Khan, a local police official, said two aerial bombing raids destroyed about 40 houses in several villages. He said bombs hit a school occupied by Taliban fighters.</p>",
  "<p>The ousted Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra skipped bail today and fled into exile in Britain claiming he could not get a fair trial on a raft of corruption charges because of political inference.</p> <p>Thaksin and his wife, Pojaman, who was sentenced to three years in jail for fraud two weeks ago, said they had gone to England with their family because they had received \"death threats\".</p> <p>The couple had been due to return from the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics to appear before the supreme court this morning to give evidence in a corruption case over a dubious land deal.</p> <p>In a hand-written statement given to Thailand's state broadcaster, Thaksin, 59, said he was travelling to England after failing to board a flight he had booked to take him back to Bangkok last night.</p> <p>No mention was made of seeking political asylum in Britain, where the former telecoms billionaire owns a lavish house. He spent most of his self-imposed exile in the UK after being deposed in the bloodless 2006 coup, buying Manchester City football club for \u00a381.6m in the process.</p> <p>Rumours were rife that the couple would flee Thailand after Pojaman, 51, was convicted of evading millions of pounds in taxes in connection with a 1997 shares transfer deal. Aides to the family emphatically scotched the suggestion.</p> <p>The day after Pojaman was sentenced along with her step-brother, Bhanapot Damapong, and former secretary, Kanchanpana Honghern, Thaksin left for a speaking engagement in Japan before travelling to China.</p> <p>Pojaman, her step-brother and former secretary boarded a flight for Beijing on Thursday to meet Thaksin. She left with nine suitcases and was given a tearful send-off at Bangkok's airport by her three children, son Phantongtae and daughters Pinthongta and Paethontan.</p> <p>Thaksin's children face several corruption allegations, but it was unclear if the reference to his \"family\" in his dramatic statement meant they too had travelled to Britain to escape the charges.</p> <p>The divisive former prime minister, who held office for five years, said he would remain in Britain indefinitely, but hoped he would be able to his homeland one day.</p> <p>\"My wife and I have travelled to reside in England,\" he said in the statement. \"If I still have luck, I would come back to die on Thai soil like every other Thai person.\"</p> <p>Five months after returning from exile to a hero's welcome, he railed that the Thai judicial system was stacked against him, despite his allies in the People Power party winning December's election.</p> <p>\"What happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree - the fruit will also be poisoned,\" he said. \"There is a continuation of dictatorship managing Thai politics ... which is followed by interference in the justice system. These are my political enemies. They don't care about the rule of law, facts or internationally recognised due process.\"</p> <p>Thaksin is on bail of \u00a3120,000 and almost \u00a31bn of his assets are frozen in Thai bank accounts. A Thai court this morning ordered the arrest of Thaksin and his wife for failing to appear at today's hearing. He could face a trial in his absence.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the military coup, Thailand considered trying to extradite Thaksin under a bilateral treaty signed with Britain in 1911. Bangkok never filed a request because it was likely Thaksin could have claimed he was the victim of a political witch-hunt.</p>",
  "<p>Before we start, The Mill would just like to clarify that it's a different Mill to the one involved in the very sad death of hot buttered, silk-voiced, slapheaded soulman Isaac Hayes. </p> <p>Right.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Bonjour. The small fourth-innings chase is one of cricket's more fascinating elements. At the best of times sport is perhaps 10% talent and 90% mind \u2013 were it the other way round Mark Ramprakash would have 11,023 runs @ 45.62 from 17 years of Test cricket \u2013 but in these situations that balance moves even further towards it being a mind game. When you are chasing under 200, with time no object, you know you will win nine times out of 10 (or four times if you're Australian) but you know that the tenth instance will cause embarrassment, humiliation and, as Thom Yorke once said, bruises that won't heal.</p> <p>Basically, you've done the hard work. You've engaged that attractive lady/boy with an opening line that's nowhere near as good as you think it is; you've made your job and indeed yourself sound ten times more interesting than they are, perhaps hinting tantalisingly at a fascinating ocean of melancholy just beneath the surface; with the aid of umpteen snifters of Strong Drink, you've held eye contact for at least 0.01 seconds longer than would be appropriate in a less sexually charged environment; you've only gone and got that ladyboy to invite you back to theirs!</p> <p>And now you can only Costanza it. You can only say, no thanks, you don't like coffee at this hour because it keeps you awake; you can only say something wildly inappropriate about tranvestisism, not knowing that their father has only just this last week undergone the change; you can only mispronounce Leffe as 'Leff-ay' and find out that, with the exception of George Lamb, this annoys them more than anything else in the entire world; you can only struggle miserably with that strap; you can only inexplicably confuse the word 'prophylactic' with 'ptedoractyl' when asking them if they have protection; you can only be told the taxi is on its way.</p> <p>It's a whole different kind of pressure, basically, and to blow it can be damaging stuff. Same goes for the fourth-innings collapse, which can impact upon a player, a generation of players, or even an entire sporting nation. Australia would not rid themselves of <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63291.html\">Headingley 81</a> for over a quarter of a century, until Shane Warne decided to remake The Exorcist as an arthouse sport movie; Damien Martyn did not play another Test for six years after slapping one to cover in <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63629.html\">Sydney 94</a>; England have been going in one direction since the unfathomable horror of <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/225443.html\">Multan 05</a> when, having played with the most splendid authority for four days in the first post-Ashes Test, they fell in a heap on the final day. It was a result that at the time felt like a blip but was actually the beginning of the end.</p> <p>That was actually one of only two occasions in the last 30 years in which England have lost when chasing a fourth-innings total of under 200 (by way of comparison Australia have failed eight times in the same time) but both, like today's involved a target in the nervous 190s: in the other, in Trinidad in 1993-94, they didn't even make <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMn4bhi-KU\">a quarter of the target of 94</a>. By rights they really should win today on a pitch that apparently remains largely blameless: but in the fourth innings of a Test, as in the third part of a horror trilogy, all bets are off.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Don't pick your nose, at least not in public.

The piece <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/07/21/on_second_thoughts_martin_mcca.html\">I was put on this earth to write</a>.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>So what will today mean?</strong> Some people will say a dead-rubber win is a dead-rubber win is a dead-rubber win. Others will say, show me a dead-rubber win and I'll show you a dead rubber. I say deliver me from Swedish furniture.</p> <p>Meanwhile, here's an email.</p> <p>\"I've a feeling that if Strauss goes early, MP Vaughan will be on the plane to India, but if Strauss hangs around for 60-odd, I can't see Vaughan having enough cricket to build his case for a tour. England surely won't take Vaughan and Strauss to India - it would be Gatting and Gooch to Aus all over again.\" The combined ages are slightly different - 77 to 64 from memory, and one of them can be hidden in the slips this time - but I take your point. For me it has to be Vaughan: better player and complements Cook perfectly, both as right-hander and initiative-seizer.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Another link</strong> James Dart and Scott 'Dulux' Murray have a book coming out based on the weekly column, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbooks.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10401_25501_132806_100_38603_38603_category_\">the Knowledge</a>, which, if it's anywhere near as good as said column, should be well worth some of your beer tokens.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 4-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 0, Cook 4)</strong> It's Ntini to finish the over he began yesterday evening, and Cook pulls him with crisp authority for four. Nice shot. I like the way Cook is moving his game on ever so slowly: in this series his strike rate in Tests is, I believe, behind only those of Broad, Bell and Pietersen, and he is pulling more often and with more class.</p> <p>Steve Hudson is on something, and I like it. \"Sir Geoffrey Boycott was mesmerising yesterday on TMS. Balanced, courteous, incisive, succinct, charitable: he was none of these things, but compulsive listening nevertheless. It's sounding more and more like a drunk driving a car with Aggers and Polly as passengers in the back, trying to grab the keys, on the verge of screaming for it all to end. Pin your ears back today.\" I won't heard a bad word against Boycott. I'll hear <em>the</em> bad word against him, but not <em>a</em> bad word.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 5-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 0, Cook 4)</strong><br>Strauss has pared his game to a ludicrous degree. He only had three shots in the first place, but watching a DVD of the 04-05 tour of South Africa reminds you how outstandingly well he played then. He was absolutely be<em>la</em>bouring the short ball. Now he is a just a sub-Tavare blocker, like a mute who has started editing his thoughts so rigorously that he never shares them. He can't be accommodated any longer in my opinion. In that over he edges Morkel just short of Harris at fourth slip.</p> <p>Here's Ian Copestake. \"Could this the day that will be remembered henceforth by all South Africans as Harris's day, or H-day if you're into the whole brevity thing?\" That's just, like, your opinion man. Actually I am still wondering how Harris managed to hoover up so many wickets against Pakistan. If it was in Salim Malik's day it would make perfect sense, but not now.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 5-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 0, Cook 4)</strong> This is Cook's 33rd Test, and it's hard to think of many players - Trescothick is one; Strauss maybe - who have played as many Tests without being dropped. But not many others. In that over he reaches to drive a wider, fuller delivery from Ntini and is beaten. Smart bowling, that, and it's a maiden.</p> <p>\"Boycott has actually turning in some high quality anti-establishment rhetoric on TMS during the last two ot three Tests,\" says Stephen Wolstencroft. \"He gave the Iraq war a proper seeing to the other week, and yesterday he was decrying the materialistic nature of the modern capitalist world, spurred on by the sudden influx of Sky money into cricket. Pop him in some sandals and hand him a bowl of lentils and he could pass for a Guardianista.\" Does he cheques from the folks as well?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Strauss looks horrible here. He's hardly playing a shot and, when he's forced to by a straight, short one from Morkel, he can only loop it straight to where silly point would have been. But he gets off the mark later in the over, working a straight one off his pads through midwicket. Good shot.</p> <p>A wee thought: in an age of a) rotation and b) enlightened attitudes to mental fragility, should England invite Trescothick to play in home Tests only? I'm starting to think that maybe they should, if only for the sake of my sanity.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Maiden from Ntini. In other news, Paul McMillan shuts me up armed with nothing other than a keen love of statistics and a Cricinfo bookmark. \"Cook's strike rate is 44.6, which is also slower than Collingwood, Harmison and <br>Flintoff. Or in other words the 3rd slowest in the top 9, behind only <br>the soon to be dropped Strauss and Ambrose.\" Ok, so maybe it's this calendar year? I definitely checked it the other day; either that or I dreamt it, the implications of which I don't want to consider in public.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Strauss does well to leave a big short ball from Morkel. No real threats to England this morning, but the problem with these two is that they can bat for an hour and you've not really gone anywhere. <br> <br>\"I have been advocating the Tresco thing ever since they picked Pattinson - if we are going for special selections, why not bring Banger in for the Ashes series?\" says Rachel Clifton. \"I saw him at Lords the other day and he was looking as good as ever.\" The first thing is that it'll never happen, but I do think it's something that should be considered. Why should his illness be any different to a player who, coincidentally, gets injured before every winter tour? You just get prior warning with this. The key is that you accept cricket is now a squad game rather than a team game. But Geoff Miller said recently he doesn't like the word 'rotation'. This after he had just rotated Paul Collingwood out of the team.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Cook is done by the Ntini angle again, pushing at and missing a slightly wider length delivery. The next ball keeps a bit lower, and there is just a hint of uneven bounce - but, as Mike Atherton points out, nothing much more than you'd expect on a fifth-day track. Another maiden.</p> <p>\"Boycs' rant on Stamp and Death Duties was a joy to behold last week. He really got stuck into it,\" says Tom Walling. \"I'd like to see him on Newsnight, alongside Paxman, as a summariser. He'd cut through the rubbish. 'My Gran could run this country better than Brown, and she'd do it with a cucumber.' Or is that a Carry On film?\" Boycott ooh-matroning his way through a Carry On film really would be something to behold.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 10-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Strauss is caught off a no-ball! He turned Morkel straight round the corner to the man at leg gully, but Morkel had overstepped by a fair distance. Sickeners come a little more definitive, but not that much.</p> <p>\"It's not exactly the same thing but Dennis Bergkamp's fear of flying meant he was available solely for the home leg of most European matches for Arsenal, which was widely accepted as he was good enough to justify his presence,\" says Michael Hunt, not unreasonably.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 10-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> <br>Wars of attrition can be as enriching as anything in sport. This, it's fair to say, isn't. But England are struggling a little, and Cook is beaten as he has a leaden-footed grope at Ntini. You can arrested for that in some cultures. \"Can these two hang on for the draw do you reckon?\" honks Dave Voss.</p> <p>In lieu of any action, the Sky team are extracting the stuff out of Nasser for his preposterous dismissal against Ntini in 2003, when he flap-hooked him straight up in the air with one foot daintily off the ground.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 11-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> <br>I think this game still has a pulse, but it's not easy to discern. Morkel. Strauss. Maiden. The other thing is that the weather is by no means to hold; it's a bit funky overhead.</p> <p>Luciano Howard utters the Banned Word: 'Adelaide'. But this <em>is</em> similar, even if the context isn't. England learnt nothing from that day and, if anything, have gone further into their shell since.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 20-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 12)</strong> <br>Cook crunches Ntini down the ground for four - he didn't time it particularly well, but that's our quota of runs for the next four overs, so enjoy them; cherish them; <em>love</em> them. Actually there are four more, pulled away beautifully through midwicket off a no-ball. It's a feast!</p> <p>\"Unfortunately,\" says Andy Bradshaw, \"CMJ was saying the other day that Trescothick didn't want to play for England full stop.\" Ah. Case closed, Columbo.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 26-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 5, Cook 16)</strong><br>Morkel is joint top wicket-taker in this series with 15, yet by common consensus he can bowl a lot better. He certainly bowls some utter dross at times, and the first ball of that over, around the wicket to Strauss, is the widest of wides. Strauss then turns one round the corner: he now has 5 from 40 balls. Michael Slater, cry your heart out. Cook then pulls for four; he plays that short so very, very well.</p> <p>\"Bad luck Smyth. Looks like the quicker-scoring Cook is to remain a feature only of your nocturnal imaginings,\" mwah-ha-hahs Tom Lawrence. \"Cook's strike rate for matches starting in 2008: 45.09, behind Harmison, Pietersen, Broad, Bell, Flintoff and Collingwood, and ahead of Ambrose, Strauss, Vaughan and the rest of the bowlers.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 33-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 12, Cook 16)</strong> Ntini beats Strauss with a gem, a trampolining leg-cutter that just missed the edge of his tentative push. Strauss then plays a very nice shot, driving Ntini pleasantly down the ground for four. He then tucks three more off his pads. It hasn't great to watch, at all, but England are slowly grinding their way into a position of control. Time for a bit of bluster and bull from Andre Nel, I think.</p> <p>\"Surely Harmison should only play home Tests too?\" says Chris Bowden. \"His newfound confidence is likely to be destroyed if he leaves the comforts (sic) of Durham and tours India, and he would risk being dropped for the Ashes.\" You say that, but Harmison actually has a splendid record on the subcontinent, where he has consistently showed an admirable willingness to get his hands dirty. Absurdly, it's in overseas conditions that should favour him - Africa and Australasia - where he has bowled like a drain. His is a much more complex case than many people think.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 39-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 13, Cook 17)</strong><br>South Africa do make a change, but it's Harris rather than Nel or Kallis. The first ball does turn (out of the rough, obviously), but if Harris bowls South Africa to victory today I'll eat my own toenail clippings. Strauss sweeps for one, and then Harris beats Cook and Boucher and England get four byes.</p> <p>\"Afternoon Rob,\" chirps unofficial Laphroaig taster Ian Taylor. \"This Thursday, after 7\u00bd years' selfless mediocrity, I'll be leaving my current employers for pastures new. Since you've left the Guardian on about 37 occasions in the last four years I wonder if you, or any of you readers, have any tips and suggestions as to how to go out in style?\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 48-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 13, Cook 26)</strong> Ntini, indefatigability incarnate even at the age of 78, continues to hustle in, and his first ball, slanted across Cook, zips past his attempted drive. Smart bowling. Cook gets some bat on it later in the over, though, steering successive deliveries to the fence at third man. This is an over too many, even for Ntini.</p> <p>\"Where did the phrase 'bowled like a drain' originate?\" asks Sam Blackledge. \"Maybe we will see an unexpected call up for a top of the range sewage system from Nottinghamshire...\" I thought we did two Tests ago?</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Drinks-break chitter-chatter</strong> <br>\"Is the talent deficit between Rolf and the rest of the SA team about as great a gulf as there has been in cricket?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Reading your colleague Jonathan Wilson's excellent book on the history of football tactics last night, I was reminded of the sensational Brazil 1982 team of Socrates, Eder, Zico etc. Up front, they had the lumbering Serginho - football's Rolf. However, I can't think of any examples from cricket to compare with Ringo, sorry Rolf.\"</p> <p>In football, I'd like to offer the lumbering fool known as Jonathan O'Shea. In cricket, probably not among the regular picks (there are one- or few-cap wonders like Scott Muller, Clybe Butts). Some would say Roger Harper, but he was a half-decent spinner, not to mention the greatest fielder of all-time.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 54-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 13, Cook 31)</strong> <br>\"Catch it\" shouts Harris, as Cook puts him miles away from any fielder and through midwicket for four. Harris really is a total nonentity.</p> <p>\"I have plenty of suggestions as to how Mr Taylor can go out in style, but they would be wasted on a man who cannot manage an evening of drinking without wrecking a perfectly innocent pair of suit trousers,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"Frankly, the best I can do is to recommend that he avoids his own leaving do like the plague.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 59-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 18, Cook 31)</strong> <br>Nel is on for Ntini, and Strauss leaves, leaves, leaves - and then tucks one off his pads for a single. Five, in fact, because Amla's unnecessary throw fies away for four overthrows.</p> <p>Iain McCulloch is getting feisty. \"SJ Harmison's 'splendid record in the sub-continent' amounts to 23 wickets at 34.65. I think you should stop eating a whole Stilton before you turn in of an evening, these statistic dreams are becoming ever more extreme.\" You want some McCulloch? A) That's a decent record for a seam bowler on the subcontinent. B) It's a very decent record for a seam bowler who's perceived to be a shi*house on the subcontinent. C) He has bowled better than those figures suggest. Next!</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 63-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 21, Cook 32)</strong> Harris is certainly getting it to rag out of the rough, but you suspect that nobody on either side really believes he is going to take wickets, and that makes a huge difference. Shane Warne could turn it exactly the same amount and end up with a six-for. Anyway, Strauss tickles one to third man for three.</p> <p>\"Surely,\" says Paul Roberts, \"Mike Brearley and the rest of his England team would be an example of a pretty large talent gap?\" He would, but only if you see cricket as a two-dimensional game.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 69-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 21, Cook 38)</strong><br>Brainlessly short from Nel, and Cook dumps him through midwicket for four with a real flourish. I think the word is 'Shot!'. England are now cruising towards their first dead-rubber victory in the final Test of the home summer since 1997, a Test best known, of course, for being the last of Digger Martin's career.</p> <p>\"I suggest that Ian Taylor puts on 'Simply The Best', does a lap of honour around the office, high-fiving each and every staff member before waving goodbye at the door with the words 'I've been Ian Taylor - you've been the best',\" says Sam Blackledge. \"Or has that been done before?\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 72-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 21, Cook 38)</strong><br>Strauss takes a dodgy single off Harris but Prince at square leg lets Cook off with a preposterously naff throw that Mark Boucher does well to stop. Cook then fresh-airs a hoick that goes through everyone and away for two byes. What's the chorus of that British Sea Power song 'No Lucifer' again?</p> <p>\"Harris reminds me of our old science teacher at school. He used to coach the cricket team as well, and when we were in the nets he's bowl his brand of off spin that everyone would clatter around,\" says Alistair Stewart. \"He'd then inform us that we'd have hit it straight at the fielder he'd have placed in anticipation of being hit a mile over his head.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 77-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 23, Cook 42)</strong> Another frankly regal pull stroke from Cook for four, although it's staggeringly witless bowling from Nel. Someone give Gunther one of those little 'Logic Problems' books to get his brain working again, please.</p> <p>\"Could you please explain to a newbie the Mike Brearley comment?\" says Andrew Hulbert. \"Do I infer correctly that he was a mediocre cricketer but did something else worthwhile?\" He was, perhaps, the greatest captain of all time - he had, as the Aussie fast bowler Rodney Hogg put it, \"a degree in people\". He was certainly in the top 10, so that more than made up for his modest batting.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 80-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 24, Cook 44)</strong> <br>England continue to prove that you can also milk a dog, taking three from Harris's over.<br> <br>\"The constant criticism of Harris from all quarters puzzles me. He is SA's Ashley Giles - bats well and does a job with the ball (keeps it tight whilst the seamers rotate),\" says David Smeath. \"He's no Shane Warne but he's no worse than countless other Test spinners over the years - remember Ian Salisbury!\" True, but there are differences: Giles was a significantly better batsman, for one, and he won a few Tests outside the subcontinent, most notably in 2004. What Harris does do, as you say, is generally keep it genuinely tight (his Test economy rate is an excellent 2.68) while the four seamers get their break. But in situations like this he's about as useful as Special Slapheads Shampoo.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 90-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 25, Cook 53)</strong> <br>Kallis, who has arguably had his series with the ball since they toured West Indies in 2000-01, comes into the attack. But he makes the mistake of bowling short to Cook, who slaps him through the covers off the back foot to reach a very fine fifty, with 10 fours (mostly thumping pull shots) and from 83 balls. It'd be nice if he could get his first century of the summer today.</p> <p>Iain McCulloch is back, armed with a thesaurus and a broadband connection. \"Smyth, there doesn't seem to be any need to get in an argument \u2013 quoting one fairly ambiguous stat made you downgrade your rating of Harmy in Asia from 'splendid' to 'decent'. If I leave you to your own devices you'll eventually run the gamut through 'middling' and 'patchy' to 'sub-standard' all by yourself. Next!\" Ah but I said his record was decent and his actual bowling (and attitude) splendid. These things are relative, in view of the conditions and perceptions as to how he will performs. Also, YOU RELEASED 'NOTHING LASTS FOREVER'. Next?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 95-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 29, Cook 53)</strong> <br>No threat from Harris, although that doesn't stop Harrus putting his hands in the air like he just don't care after every ball. Strauss comes down the track and screws him through midwicket for four more.</p> <p>Talking of which. \"Does Harris throwing his arms up in the air after every delivery annoy anyone else as much as me?\" says Zac Aldridge, knowing full well the answer. \"He's never going to convince anyone that he can turn the ball.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 100-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 32, Cook 55)</strong> <br>England are past halfway, and now past 100. It's all over bar the dawdling, but the next 90 runs might have great significance for Michael Vaughan's future. If Strauss is, say, 65 not out he will be hard to drop, as Gary Naylor pointed out earlier.</p> <p>Here's Tom Lawrence. \"<a href=\"http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=1;class=1;filter=advanced;home_or_away=2;opposition=6;opposition=7;opposition=8;orderby=bowling_average;spanmax1=11+Aug+2008;spanmin1=11+Aug+1998;spanval1=span;team=1;template=results;type=bowling\">This link</a> below displays pace bowling stats for the last ten years for England playing away Test matches against India, Pakistan or Sri Lanka.

They should give his match fee to charity, or JD Wetherspoons, and play with 10 men. Frankly, South Africa look like they couldn't give one anymore, and why should they? I wonder what percentage of dead rubbers are won by the side that has lost the series. I bet it's ludicrously high in view of the fact that the side that lost the series is invariably, intrinsically inferior.</p> <p>Here's Raja Dasgupta. \"Re: David Smeath's comment in the 23rd Over ('The constant criticism of Harris from all quarters puzzles me. He is SA's Ashley Giles') - does this count as damning with faint praise, or just damning.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 109-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 38, Cook 58)</strong> <br>Morkel goes past the outside edge of Strauss, the first time that has happened in a while. But England are scoring at a steady rate now, gobbling up runs like Pac-Man does those things he gobbles up. </p> <p>Nick Evans exposes cricket journos for the idiots they are shocker. \"Is it just me or has the coverage of this series focused on the SA batsmen 'booking in for bed and breakfast', and ours batting like carefree ne'er-do-wells who sneak out of a bedroom window at 7am minus half their clothing? Yes Strauss is a far less attractive batsman than in 05, but if Cooky is by all accounts playing a few more shots, surely that should be a nice balance with Strauss leaving everything outside off, boring the bowlers into bowling at the stumps a la McKenzie?\" </p> <p>I think you need one initiative-seizer of an opener: Smith does it for South Africa; Cook isn't ready to do that yet, and ideally should be allowed to develop in his own bubble. In terms of the whole series, I think South Africa have just played the context very well - coincidentally, most of the time it has demanded an accumulative approach - whereas England seem to have one approach regardless of the context.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 109-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 38, Cook 58)</strong><br>What England have done well this morning is use their feet against Harris. There was a 0.00000001 per cent chance that he would settle into a groove and bowl them out on a fifth-day pitch. They took away that chance by not allowing him to settle through positive foot movement (is there any other kind?) and the resulting shots. </p> <p>Iain McCulloch's back for more. \"Darren Gough's sub-continental record is 24 wickets @ 22.58. Now that is splendid. But I'd love to hear your thoughts on his attitude and everything else, cos that's obviously more relevant. And 'Nothing Lasts Forever' reached number 8.00 in the charts, another splendid record.\" Yes, and Darren Gough was world-class whereas Steve Harmison is simply very good. Plus Gough reverse-swings it, which is a huge weapon to have on the subcontinent. Plus Gough's attitude was never questioned, so in mentioning attitude you are being deliberate disingenuous. That's naughty. Bad boy. Naughty boy. Your second point I won't even dignify with a response.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>That's lunch</strong> After a soul-sappingly slow start, Strauss and in particular Cook took complete control against a South African side who left their hearts in San Francheesy, or at least the Edgbaston dressing-room. See you in 30 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>\"Lunch is... lunch is difficult\"</strong> So says the brilliant Brain in the film Brick. And he's right. When you've only got 40 minutes between OBO sessions, lunch can be difficult. Especially when the nearby Sainsbury's has a queue of about 431 people, all spending their daily cheque from the parents on \u00a35 salad leaves and Fairtrade Tic-Tacs.</p> <p>Anyway, the players should be back on in a bit, and sometime around 3.15pm England will be getting ever so slightly giddy on the smell of dead rubber. It's legal, you know.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Lunchtime chat</strong> \"Losing the last Test in a dead rubber depends on the nature of the team, surely,\" says Pete Gay. \"I don't remember tGarner, Holding and co going to sleep in the last mach of a series or, for that matter, the Australians recently. Both those teams were quite happy to rub the opposition's noses in it as hard as they could.\" True with Waugh's Australia, but Taylor's were renowned for it, and even Waugh's did it on occasion: South Africa 2001-02, the Ashes 2002-03. West Indies had a couple as well, most notably - and absurdly - at the hands of Murray Bennett, Bob Holland and Allan Border in 1984-85 and 1988-89.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 115-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 38, Cook 63)</strong> <br>Ntini begins after lunch in what might just be his final spell on these shores. He's been a trooper and all, but I worry about him if he plays in Australia in a few months' time. He will go <em>every</em>where. Anyhoo, in that over he has a big shout for LBW against Strauss, but it obviously pitched outside leg, even to the naked eye. Cook then pushes him blissfully straight for four.</p> <p>\"I have no telly here but I do have windows and its hammering down,\" says Chris Miller. \"Where's the rain? I have money on a draw...\" Don't know how to break this, Chris, but the weather <em>isn't the same all round the world</em>?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>31th over: England 119-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 42, Cook 63)</strong><br>The man who won the little-known South African reality TV show, How Do You Solve A Problem Like Tayfield?, continues to bowl to absolutely no effect whatsoever. Strauss works one round the corner for a couple. This presents a really interesting selection problem, because they won't have the stones to drop Strauss now that he has made one whole fifty in the series. So that means - if we work on the not unreasonable assumption that five bowlers are back for the forseeable future - that there is probably only room for one of Vaughan, Bopara and Shah in the squad to tour India.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Starship CD?\" writes one of OBO's finest, Sam Collins. \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 123-1 (Cook c Smith b Ntini 67)</strong><br>Cook fails in the sixties for the seventh time in the last year. The ball after pulling another blistering boundary, he drove at a full delivery from Ntini that left him just enough to take the edge and went straight into the shovel hands of Graeme Smith at first slip.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 127-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 42, Bell 0)</strong><br>Bell walks a long, long way across his stumps to Ntini first ball. The ball flies to third man - but it's given as leg-byes, which means it must have been a pretty close shout, even allowing for Ntini's largely prohibitive angle. Hawkeye indeed has it hitting a good portion of leg stump.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Mick Hucknall poster?\" writes Sam Collins. \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 130-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 45, Bell 0)</strong><br>Strauss lifts Harris high over the infield, like a father hoisting his child above his head, for a couple. I wouldn't even take Harris as a Kolpak; he is useless.</p> <p>\"So, the question is, is Cook the 'new' Thorpe? Scoring plenty of <br>half tons, and not converting,\" says David Horn. \"And, if so, is that a bad thing? Discuss.\" Interesting. They could hardly have got those half-tons in different ways, but it was a huge problem for Thorpe (and another left-hander, Stephen Fleming), in the first half of his career. The thing is, of course, that before this year it wasn't a problem: I think only Bradman, Miandad and A.N.Other had scored more Test tons before their 23rd birthday.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 138-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 53, Bell 0)</strong> Strauss screws a back-foot force off Ntini to third man. With nobody there, it goes for four. Strauss then plays a really nice stroke through midwicket for a boundary that brings up his fifty, his first of the series, from 95 balls and with five fours. It's been a pulse-free effort, but it's probably breathed new life into his Test career.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Angela Lansbury keyring?\" writes Sam Collins (well, nobody <em>else</em> is writing in, are they eh?). \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 138-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 53, Bell 0)</strong> <br>Harris continues over the wicket to Bell and - no word of a lie - he has a chance put down. Bell, going back, gets a big inside-edge onto the pad and McKenzie at short leg, moving to his right with all the speed of fossilisation (copyright Georgina Turner 2006), puts it down.</p> <p>\"Assuming we limp there soon, have you ever been more underwhelmed by a win?\" asks Lee Calvert. I was fairly underwhelmed when I 'won' a packet of Chewits simply for having my haircut at some dodgy alcoholic barbers (you never went after lunch, or if you did you paid the price) in Milton Regis once when I was kid, but that's about it.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 142-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 57, Bell 0)</strong><br>Good shot from Strauss, showing the full face to Ntini and putting him back down the ground for four. If England lose this, there's only one person to blame: Tom Daley. I've yet to be convinced he's not responsible for the sad drop in quality of Peep Show either. And as for the disappearance of Beef Discos.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Paul McKenna bottom-shaver?\" writes Sam Collins. \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 146-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 57, Bell 4)</strong> Bell is a little uneasy against Harris as he gets used to the rough and the over-the-wicket angle, but it's just barely noticeable detail on the bigger picture of the match. Which is in itself barely noticeable etc on the bigger picture of the series.</p> <p>Eventually Bell works Harris nicely through midwicket for four to get off the mark.</p> <p>\"This consolation win is going book this whole shower on the plane to India, and then into the Ashes team,\" harrumphs Alfred Moore, who I might call Alfie from now on just for the sake of it. \"I've suspected for a while that Strauss is the consummate cricket politician - great at getting elected, but rubbish at governing - because he knows that a fifty in the last Test is worth about a hundred and fifty in the first.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 147-2 (Bell b Ntini 4)</strong><br>Great idea/execution combos of our time: part one in a short series. Ian Bell, the Oval, 2008, decides to combat Makhaya Ntini's unusual angle by walking miles across his stumps to work him to leg. He should be given LBW first ball but isn't. He carries on regardless, fearless eejit that he is, and is bowled round his legs from <em>over</em> the wicket playing exactly the same shot. Dear oh dear; that was pitiful.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 147-2 (chasing 197, Strauss 57, Pietersen 0)</strong><br>The idea is not unsound - Pietersen does it excellently against Ntini to open up the leg side - but Bell misjudged the extent to which he needed to go across to a frankly hideous degree.</p> <p>\"Rob, it's time to put your cards on the table and give us your touring 15 for India,\" says Sam Blackledge. Not this again! I did the other day! (!!!!!!!!). Anyway, it would be: Cook, Vaughan, Bell, KP (we're friends; he calls me RS, at least I think that's what he says honkety honk!), Collingwood, Flintoff, Prior, Foster, Harmison, Sidebottom, Jones, Panesar, Swann, Broad, Bopara.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 147-3 (Strauss c Smith b Harris 58)</strong><br>Could an epic farce be unfolding? Probably not, but Strauss has gone. It was straightforward stuff: he pushed forward with hard hands at Harris, but got an inside-edge onto the pad and round the corner to Smith at leg slip.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 148-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 0, Collingwood 1)</strong><br>I'm putting some salt on my toenails just in case, because if England lose another one it opens up a huge tail. Still, I'm sure there is no chance of them blowing this. Collingwood pads up to the rest of Harris's over.</p> <p>\"Do you have my matching Gareth Gates pyjamas and duvet cover set?\" says James McKerney. \"I can't find them anywhere.\" Actually I <em>do</em>. Do you need them back straight away? They're awful comfortable.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 152-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 0, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>Collingwood works Ntini to leg for an all-run four, and then misses a pull that goes through to Boucher. Atherton thinks there was an inside-edge but replays show it just hit the right thigh. Outstanding umpiring from Steve Davis.</p> <p>If Collingwood is to stay in this team - and he deserves to in the short term after that century - it must be at No5. He and Pietersen bat really well together. It's odd that teams are happy to structure a batting order according to left-hand/right-hand balance but rarely in accordance with something more important: chemistry. Anyone think of other great pairs batting together? When they weren't running each other out farcically, Butcher and Hussain were superb together - there was Brisbane 98, Nottingham 03, Jamaica 04, Headingley 01, and other family favourites.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 156-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 4, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>Pietersen uses that huge reach to whip Harris majestically, and against the spin, through midwicket for four, a shot of naked, mind-boggling talent.</p> <p>\"Many thanks for starting the Tom Daley backlash,\" says David Hopkins. \"No one likes a show-off, especially one who is less than half your age. Can I be the first to state that even if he is only fourteen, he still finished last which makes him a LOSER. Could you arrange for the Guardian to print a Tom Daley dartboard cf. the Sun's David Beckham one in 1998.\" I don't know about a dartboard, but I'm sure he could be included as a key ingredient in one of the free recipes.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 161-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>Morkel is back on, for Ntini, and it's a sign that South Africa aren't too bothered about this that they haven't brought on Kallis to bowl at his bunny. Either that or Kallis is carrying an injury. Pietersen, in the meantime, plays another sumptuous wristy stroke through midwicket, this time for three off Morkel. </p> <p>\"Wot no Shah?\" says Steve Busfield. \"Does this batting line up not need some refreshing?\" Well it does, but Collingwood has done enough to stay in for a bit now. With the exception of Pietersen and to an extent Cook, everyone's places are up for grabs in the short-to-medium term. But I think Bell, Vaughan and Collingwood have done enough to deserve a chance in India. Key is next cab on the rank for Bell, Denly for Vaughan, and Bopara for Collingwood. In my opinion too much water has gone under the bridge - like with Andy Cole and England - for Shah to be able to play with freedom in the Test team. They are only so many times you can be rejected before you conclude that it's not them, it's you. Not playing him in Sri Lanka last year was a disgusting decision on, at a conservative estimate, 46 levels.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 161-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>This could turn out very, very well for KP: a win in the first Test as captain, the man of the match award I would have thought, and maybe the winning runs as well. Anyway, Harris continues into the rough, and I suspect it won't be too long before we see the first switch-hit from a Test captain. He actually dummied to do it from one ball in that over. </p> <p>\"Hussain and Butcher were good, but Hoggy and Gilo were superb!\" says Gary Naylor, eschewing insight in favour of unashamedly brainless nostalgia. And who can blame him, frankly.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 170-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 14)</strong><br>Consecutive boundaries for Collingwood off Morkel: the first was pulled witheringly, the second time through midwicket. </p> <p>\"For a brief while Flintoff and Geraint Jones proved a fine partnership,\" says Paul Roberts (and a few others). \"Maybe to recover Freddie's batting form, England need to recall Papua New Guinea's finest.\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 170-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 15)</strong> For those of you calling me various shades of eff, the reason I'd leave Anderson out is that, for all his admirable improvement, I just don't think he is good enough to take wickets against the very best. Do what the opposition least want you to do. Ricky Ponting would pick Anderson to bowl at him all day.</p> <p>\"Have you got my signed photo of Tom Daley?\" says Wesley Ball. \"If you have, you can keep it.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 175-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 8, Collingwood 19)</strong> Nearly there now, as Collingwood dumps Morkel contemptuously over midwicket for four more. There is a perception about Collingwood that he doesn't have shots, but it's more about the mindset he sometimes gets into when he's wearing whites. Batting with KP frees him up, I think.</p> <p>\"What's Vaughan done with the bat of late?\" challenges Dominic O'Reilly. Sweet eff, but I think he's earned enough slack for us to accept his explanation - that the captaincy was frazzling his mind - and to give him at least those two Tests to see if he was right or if he was telling big fat porkies. A year ago, in Sri Lanka, he played superbly as an opener - and with the dustbowls we'll probably get it's even more importantly we have an opener who embraces calculated risk against the new ball.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 175-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 8, Collingwood 19)</strong><br>Harris and KP continue their little leg-stump stand-off: it's Adelaide 2006 all over again! (The good bit, on the second day, not the unmentionable.) A maiden.</p> <p>\"Hear hear re: that irritatingly little snot-nosed brat at the Olympics,\" says Richard Norris. \"I know he's only 14, but what does he want: a medal?\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 178-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 9, Collingwood 19)</strong><br>Pietersen takes one of his buttock-clenchingly tight singles into the off side. The throw missed by a while; had it hit it would have been, well, buttock-clenchingly tight.</p> <p>\"I remember Robin Smith and Allan Lamb being great together in the late 80s/very early 90s,\" says Oliver Lewis. \"Yes, they were both Saffers, but I think crucially both had moustaches. More than a coincidence I think.\" Especially against the West Indies, when they went way beyond the call of duty for their adopted country.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 182-4 (Pietersen c McKenzie b Harris 13)</strong> <br>Pietersen falls in tame fashion. Harris switched to around the wicket with mid-off and mid-on back in an attempt to play on the ego, and Pietersen just plopped one onto his pad and up in the air for short leg to take the catch.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 182-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 19, Flintoff 0)</strong><br>Kim Sibthorpe's life may be missing something: life, chiefly. \"Whatever happened to the slower ball?? I was thinking about this the other day.\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 185-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 22, Flintoff 1)</strong><br>Nel comes on for one last spurt, but somebody forgot to grease him up: he's rumbling in at about quarter rat-power.</p> <p>\"Couldn't agree more about Anderson,\" says Alfie Moore. \"This is supposed to have been his breakthrough season, but 15 wickets @ 34 doesn't seem much of a breakthrough. Compare Hoggard's breakthrough series in South Africa 04-05: 26 wickets @ 25. If we stick with Anderson we'll just be cultivating mediocrity - we'd be better off bringing back Hoggard, who has the nous to be our Chaminda Vaas.\" What he said.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>51st over: England 186-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 23, Flintoff 1)</strong><br>Mid-off and mid-on go back for Flintoff against Harris as well, though not quite as far as for Pietersen, but Flintoff isn't yet confident enough in this environment to finish a game as he would at county level, or as he would at Test level a few years back, so he blocks assiduously.</p> <p>\"Just about any combination of very tall and very short batsmen works well, as it upsets the bowler's length,\" says John Starbuck, inadvertently pointing out that Will Jefferson is the key to Tim Ambrose's Test career. \"Think Greig and Knott, if your memory goes that far back.\" My memory doesn't go back to the start of thi- what day is this?</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>52nd over: England 188-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 25, Flintoff 1)</strong><br>Collingwood tucks Nel off his pads and, in a gesture that sums up the man, Ntini charges across the boundary, dives and saves two runs: an outstanding piece of work. What a thoroughly admirable fellow he is.</p> <p>\"Is Tom Daley the greatest British loser since Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards,\" says Lee Calvert, \"Sure, Daley has the excuse of being 14, but Edwards equally had the excuse of being nearly blind. Also, Daley has had access to pools full of water for all of his recently over-exposed life while Eddie had to practice on slides in his local park, skateboard half-pipes and his own stairs. And while I'm on, have you got my Diagnosis Murder tankard?\" Gave it to Sam Collins. You'll do well to get that back.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>ENGLAND WIN AN ENTIRELY MEANINGLESS GAME BY SIX WICKETS!!! </strong> <br>Flintoff rocks back to cut Harris for four and then, when Harris tempts him with some flight, Flintoff can't resist ending the match in the grand manner with the most marvellous straight six. He finishes on 11 and Paul Collingwood on 25.</p> <p>So there we are. It's a happy ending to a pretty downbeat summer, but at least England can go forward into the winter with optimism, however misplaced it might seem to be. They were always going to win this game after rolling South Africa on the first day, and they finished the job pretty efficiently today. Certainly, they look a better side with five bowlers. Thanks for all your emails, and please do rejoin us for the one-day series in 11 days' time. Please.</p>",
  "<p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/anglicanism\">Lambeth conference</a> in Canterbury was drawing to a close, Michael Causer <a href=\"http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2008/08/04/campaigners-plan-march-in-memory-of-michael-causer-64375-21459419/\">died</a>. He was not an Anglican bishop, but an 18-year-old hairdresser, a popular lad described by his family as \"definitely a 'people's person'. Our world will never be the same without him.\" He was the victim of a homophobic attack.</p> <p>In other countries too, during the conference, virulent hatred of gays and lesbians continued to take its toll \u2013 sometimes in spectacular fashion. A gunman in Tennessee <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7529450.stm\">shot two people dead</a> during a children's performance in a Unitarian church he thought too \"liberal\" before being overpowered. A Ugandan gay and lesbian rights activist was kidnapped by police in Kampala and <a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8516.html\">tortured</a>. A wave of homophobia <a href=\"http://www.asia-pacific-action.org/node/110\">swept</a> Indonesian capital Jakarta, and arrests were reported. </p> <p>In many countries, repressive laws fuel bigotry. All too often in schools and workplaces, temples and churches worldwide, people learn to hate or despise lesbians and gays. To Christians, this is tragic, not just for the victims: those who do not love their neighbour are spiritually dead. Yet talk among Anglican Communion leaders about homosexuality seemed oddly disconnected from the world in which most of us live, and the challenge to make it more just and loving.</p> <p>Every decade or so, the Lambeth conference has urged bishops to champion human rights for all and enter into dialogue with the gay and lesbian community. But this has been widely ignored: blessing same-sex couples is apparently a far greater offence than allying with repressive governments to hunt them down. </p> <p>This year, the conference began promisingly. There were calls for an inclusive communion with space for everyone, unity in diversity, and for the church to speak out for the voiceless. Space was created to discuss issues of justice and power \u2013 international, national and domestic. Genuine listening was encouraged among bishops, and many, including a number of conservatives, made efforts to hear one another and understand experiences different from their own. Some visited exhibitions and fringe events run by pro-inclusion activists. Friendship and mutual understanding were fostered, lasting gains made.</p> <p>Yet some bishops continued to insist that tensions were the fault of \"liberal\" churches which had moved too far in including partnered lesbians and gays, as if the refusal by some \"conservative\" leaders to engage in the \"listening process\" or uphold human rights had not helped to polarise Anglicans. Tighter discipline was urged, with new structures to stop churches welcoming all on equal terms. In return, bishops poaching in others' territory might be persuaded to stop. </p> <p>On the Sunday when the conference ended, speakers at the <a href=\"http://www.aids2008.org/\">International Aids Conference</a> in Mexico highlighted the deadly impact of homophobia. Discrimination against men who have sex with men must end, the secretary general of the United Nations urged. \"We need to engage them, we need to take care of them, we should not forget about them,\" said the director general of the World Health Organisation. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Lambeth conference, the Archbishop of Canterbury appealed for a \"covenant of faith\" that would \"promise to our fellow human beings the generosity God has shown us\", and suggested \"a Pastoral Forum to support minorities\". But to him, those needing greater generosity and pastoral care were mainly Christians with strong objections to same-sex partnerships. While he is a humane man, his priorities seem strange. If Anglicans are to remain relevant, and a force for good, bishops need to listen more carefully to people like Michael Causer's family.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>And on the third day of the Olympics</strong>, your minute-by-minute correspondent has for you - 14 year-old Tom Daley makes the youngest Olympic debut by a Brit since <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmail.net/news/headlines/display.var.2078538.0.youngest_olympian_reclaims_title.php\">Ken Burns</a>, Michael Phelps in the pool, the Murray brothers, Great Britain versus Pakistan in the hockey, Britain's Andrew Smith in the badminton, Rebecca Adlington and Jo Jackson going for gold in the freestyle, not to mention archery, basketball, sailing, shooting and fencing.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>02:05am: </strong>Straight off to Hong Kong where Daisy Dick has just recorded a clear round on Spring Along in the cross country stage of the <strong>team eventing</strong>, getting round in 8:42.89. As you can read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympics2008.olympicsequestrian\">here,</a> Britain are currently lying fourth in the team event. Let me also quickly point you to our handy day's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/events/aug/09\">schedule</a> (in Chinese time) and encourage you to sign up for our free daily email, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thebeijinger\">The Beijinger</a>.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>02: 15am:</strong> Next up is William Fox-Pitt, who it's fair to say completely blitzed the course. He went round in 8:24.39 - which moved him up from 34th to fifth. Temper your excitement, however. Only three of the team's scores count. That is the last three. IE. Not Daisy Dick or William Fox Pitt unless everyone else messes it up.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>02:21am: </strong>Re-live your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/mar/05/features.sport10\">Sean Kerly memories</a>. Today's first <strong>hockey</strong> match, between China and Germany is currently locked at 1-1. At 0330 it's the wrongly fallen from public favour Great Britain against Pakistan, who have plenty of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/29/olympicshockey.olympicgames2008?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=sport\">problems of their own</a>.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>02:29am: </strong>Watching the Turko/Greek news earlier, I was struck by how heavily they're going on both the basketball and <strong>beach volleyball</strong>. After losing the first set, Latvia are pushing hard to level it up with Argentina in today's men's beach volley.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>02:39am:</strong> So yesterday saw Nicole Cook take the first British gold of the Games, made extra special nice because no-one on the outside (apart from <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/canny_rehearsals_of_team_cooke.html\">William Fotheringham</a>) really expected it. Today the big hopes rest with Rebecca Adlington and Jo Jackson in the 400m freestyle at 0415ish. And a bit later in the morning with the British archery team of Larry Godfrey, Alan Wills and Simon Terry. Of course, a bit like this year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/14/popandrock.shopping\">Elbow album</a>, what you love about the Olympics is the heroes what come from nowhere. Perhaps the next one will be Scot Jon Hammond currently trying to qualify for the men's 10m air rifle.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>02: 48am:</strong> Their world championship-winning men's team beat Greece in impressive fashion yesterday, today it's the Spanish women's <strong>basketball </strong>team's turn. They're already 18-7 up against New Zealand. We'll draw a veil over the fact the Spanish men's team posed for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicsbasketball.olympics20081\">photo </a>making slit-eyed gestures.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>02:50am:</strong> I've cursed him. Briton Jon Hammond lies 40th midway through his 10m air rifle qualification. He really would be an unexpected medal hero now.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>02:59am: </strong><strong>Swimming</strong>. It might be the 100m relay, but one man is going to dominate the coverage - that man <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicsaquatics.olympics2008\">Michael Phelps</a>. What no-one predicted, however, was Britain to qualify. They just finished fourth in their semi-final - setting a new British record of 3:13:69 by 5 seconds in the process. The French won in near world record time.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>03:02: am </strong>Hockey. Germany have beaten China 4-1 in the hockey. In the women's <strong>basketball</strong>, Spain are now leading New Zealand 40-27.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.05 am:</strong> <strong>Badminton. </strong>Want to see the Milton Keynes house of British badminton hopeful Andrew Smith? Well now you can, courtesy of this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAaLa2QhlLw\">unenthusiastic Team GB diary</a>. The words contractually and obliged spring to mind. Anyway, Smith is about to start a tough match with Marc Zwiebler. At least the German can't do backhand smashes like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahd5smCyaaw\">this</a>.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.10 am:</strong> <strong>Team Eventing. </strong>The first 'proper' British rider, Tina Cook, has had a good round scoring 57.4. She lies sixth place overall, Fox-Pitt is now ninth. A bit surreally, the cross-country course crosses over a golf course, which sounds like a good excuse to remind you that earlier this morning Padraig Harrington won the US PGA at Oakland Hills. After winning the same amount of majors as Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Phil Mickelson - <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/is_padraig_harrington_now_the.html\">is Padraig Harrington now the best of the rest?</a></p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.15 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/phelps_might_truly_be_touched.html\">Andy Bull doesn't reckon he's all that</a>, but Michael Phelps bid to win eight golds just keeps on trucking. The American just qualified for the final in the 200m freestyle, albeit in a tired third. Talking about living legends, congratulations to Australian, Stephanie Rice, who won the women's 400 meter individual medley on Sunday will be on her very own stamp from tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.25 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming.</strong> Time for some <strong>Britwatch</strong>. Gemma Spofforth qualified for the 100m backstroke final as the fifth fastest qualifier with a time of 59.79. Tom Daley? You might have heard of him. Paul Kelso will be blogging live poolside on the Devon boy's exploits from 7am <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html \">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.35 am:</strong> <strong>Badminton. </strong>Andrew Smith has won his first game 21-16 against Marc Zwiebler. <strong>Tennis. </strong>Rafael Nadal is just warming-up ahead of opening his Olympic campaign against Italian Potito Starace. Like yesterday, however, it seems that the play will be interrupted by rain. That'd never happen at Wimbledon, you know.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.35 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming.</strong> <strong>Gold medal. </strong>Australian world champion Libby Trickett wins the 100m fly in some style. American Christine Magnuson was second and Trickett's teammate Jessicah Schipper third. Britain's Jemma Lowe finishes sixth in her first Olympic final.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.40 am:</strong> <strong>Hockey.</strong> With 22 minutes of the first half to go, GB are 1-0 up against Pakistan.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.45 am:</strong> The <strong>swimming</strong> pool is the place to go for world records. Japan's Kosuke Kitajima smashes the 59 second barrier to take gold in the 100m breaststroke. Alexander Dale Oen of Norway takes silver while France's Hugues Duboscq claims bronze.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>4.00 am:</strong> <strong>A Britwatch special</strong>. Not with Nick Ross. Though after winning the first game, Andrew Smith has criminally thrown it away in the <strong>badminton</strong>. The German Marc Zwiebler recovered to win the final two games. The British <strong>archery</strong> team are 81-78 down against China. In the <strong>shooting </strong>Jon Hammond finished 29th in the 10m air rifle semi-final, not good enough to make the final. In a <a href=\"http://www.billybragg.co.uk/index.php\">Bill Bragg </a>patriotic way, good job that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympicsaquatics.olympics2008\">Rebecca Adlington </a>and Jo Jackson are due in the pool.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>4.15 am:</strong> In <strong>basketball</strong>, Isobel Sanchez drove Spain's women to rout New Zealand 82-65. In <strong>handball</strong>, it says here, France have beaten Kazakhstan 21-18. Rebecca Adlington and Jo Jackson are being introduced to the crowd. We're just moments away from the 400m freestyle event...</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>4.20 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. Gold and Bronze for team GB! </strong>The Pixar film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/18/animation\">Wall-E</a> was a massive disappointment for me. Really boring and morally if not politically dubious like Lang's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(film)\">Metropolis</a>. But that, my friends was the opposite x100. An absolutely corking race! Gold for GB with Rebecca Adlington! Bronze for Jo Jackson! Ladies and gentleman, is why we love the Olympics. Katie Hoff of the States was second. 48 years of women's swimming hurt erased at 4 something in the morning.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Email chat not from Gary Naylor. </strong> \"Don't know if you noticed,\" asks Conor O'Kane. \"But Adrian Moorhouse just said Bas(snip! theguardian.com Ed) on the Beeb. Butterfly is a relatively new event, came from breaststroke around fifty years ago, It's the Bas(snip! theguardian.com Ed) child of Breast stroke\". Frankly, after that race, we're all swearing now. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. That was freaking brilliant.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>4.30 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>The great racing keeps coming. Michael Phelps eight gold medal haul is still on - he's just secured his second gold. The United States just pipped the 4x100m freestyle relay from France in the most dramatic possible circumstances. We're talking inches. Moot point whether French blew that on the final leg, or the States snatched it.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Hockey. </strong>Christian Wolff is frustrated because Indian state TV is not showing the swimming. What are they showing Christian? \"We are being treated to the GB-Pak hockey match - presumably because Indians love seeing Pakistan lose...\" Oh, yes, Team GB are 3-1 up against Pakistan. With 15 mins to go.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4.45 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>We're still having a collective intake of breath over two exceptional races. On the telly Sharon Davies is still crying about Rebecca Adlington's gold and Jo Jackson's bronze. Meanwhile, Chris Wright is blown away by that 4x100 Freestyle relay, \"That 4x100 was amazing. The first five all beat the world record and even Britain, in last, were just half a second outside it.\" And in Christian Wolff in India, 'state TV's toying with its viewers has reached new heights: about 10 minutes ago, the hockey match was interrupted - said the studio anchor, \"and we're interrupting the hockey for good reason..\" - presumably to show the 4x100m relay final, RIGHT?! - \"in order to show you yesterday's highlights!\" Really.' Team GB are 4-2 up against Pakistan in the hockey as the game enters its dying moments.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.55 am:</strong> <strong>Equestrian.</strong> In fairness to Indian tv, all the non-Brits I know, are really frustrated with British Olympic coverage. Where is all the water polo? And the beach volleyball? They ask. Especially, our national obsession with 'horse racing, that isn't even horse racing.\" And what of our Eventing team? Well, William Fox-Pitt rode fastest for Great Britain who have risen to third after the cross country. The German team lead the rankings after impressive performances from their riders, while Australia dropped to second.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>5.00 am:</strong> <strong>Archery</strong> \"As the only Englishman in an all Chinese office here in Beijing,\" writes Steve George, \"the atmosphere is proving unusually tense, is anyone else watching the team GB/China archery showdown? Epic stuff, who'd have thought it...?\" Indeed, the giant darts competition was a bit of Lakeside thriller... But China edged out Team GB 214-210 in the end. Better for office diplomacy, I'm guessing.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>5.05 am:</strong> <strong>Cycling.</strong> From the sublime to the ridiculous. Spanish track cyclist Maria Isabel Moreno has been named as the first competitor in Beijing to fail a drugs test. Moreno, 27, would have been a rival of Britain's gold medallist Nicole Cook, tested positive for the blood-doping agent EPO.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>5.10 am:</strong> It's time for a Brit-in-the-antipodes-perspective from Andrew Jolly. \"At least for Brits at home it's all on in the middle of the night, and you don't have to face Olympic Mad Aussies popping into your office every 10 seconds to say that some Australian swimmer or other has smashed out a world record in the pool. I watched us win that race a moment ago, but am withholding any sort of interoffice gloat fest at the moment, I have learned from the Ashes that one wicket does not make a test match. Not even one. Or even a draw... Bring on the velodrome.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>5.25 am:</strong> <strong>Shooting. </strong>Joy for Christian Wolff. Indian tv can stop showing Pakistan losing, India have won gold. Abhinav Bindra wins the men's 10m air rifle.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Brit-in-the-antipodes-perspective II.</strong> \"TVNZ have helpfully got three live streaming channels online in addition to their TV coverage (also streamed online). Hurrah, thought I, I'll be able to watch the swimming. Except work's gone and blocked the stream\", tuts Joanna Harris in New Zealand, \"Of course there's no saying TVNZ would have shown the swimming; so far their coverage has been pretty appalling, for example hours of beach volleyball and boxing instead of rowing (we got the Kiwis' races, but that was it). And there are ad breaks every ten minutes.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>5.30 am:</strong> <strong>Tennis.</strong>World No.1 elect Rafael Nadal is making uncharacteristically hard work of Italian World No.71 Potito Starace. After losing the first set, Strarace has pulled the second set back. It's going with serve in the third set.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>5.45 am:</strong> <strong>Fencing. Britwatch. </strong>The USA's Erinn Smart beat Martina Emanuel 15 pts-7 pts. Still, fencing's never as good to watch as you'd think it would be.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Brit in the Philippines, Al Parkes,</strong> \"sympathises with the Brit in Kiwiland about the beach volleyball (had to endure hours of it here in Philippines, yesterday, too) but not about the boxing - we also got hours of that, but that's ok by me...\" I'm with you, Al. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympicsboxing.olympics20081\">Billy Jo Saunders</a>. What a guy.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>5.50 am:</strong> Just cos a few of you have asked about it. The medal table... It's nowt to do with me. It's been outsourced. No, really.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>5.55 am:</strong><strong> Badminton. </strong>In a seismic shuttlecock shock unseeded Japanese duo Maeda Miyuki and Suetsuna Satoko eliminated defending Olympic champions Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen in the women's doubles. All eyes (and excruciating pressure) on men's top seed Lin Dan, who plays unseeded Ng Wei of Hong Kong. And Chinese tv watch, Steve George, reckons \"Joanna Harris should consider herself lucky, yesterday Chinese state television appeared to show nothing but 9 hours of back to back power lifting.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>6.05 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>It's been a great day in the pool. Brits <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Rebecca Aldington and Jo Jackson</a> brought home gold and bronze medals in the 400m freestyle. Though, sadly, there was no resurrection for Athens finalist Laure Manaudou. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Marina Hyde</a>, wrote a fine piece on her extraordinary story in today's big paper. There's been plenty of drama. And at 7am 14 year-old Tom Daley will make his Olympic debut. Paul Kelso will be blogging from the poolside at 7. Join him <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html \">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>6.15 am:</strong> <strong>Tennis. </strong>After a flat middle period, Rafael Nadal took the third set and the game to defeat Italian minnow Potito Starace. <strong>Women's basketball. </strong>The Czech Republic destroyed Mail 81-47.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>6.20 am:</strong> Foreign news round-up one. <strong>Weightlifting. </strong>Just looking through the foreign papers, if Laure Manaudou was the melodramatic/tragic story, Turkish weightlifter Sibel Ozkan is one of the uplifting ones. As you might remember, Ozkan came from nowhere to win silver in the surprisingly fruity 48kg medal class behind Chinese No.1 Chen Xiexia on the first day of the games. Raised in state care, she dedicated the medal to her dead mother as she was made 'State Sportsman' and received 2,000 gold pieces (worth about \u00a3240,000) from the Turkish government.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>6.30 AM:</strong> Foreign news round-up two. <strong>Swimming. </strong> The IOC have accepted the explanation of an Iranian swimmer, Mohammad Alirezaei, who withdrew from the heats of the men's 100-meter breaststroke on Saturday just before he was due to compete against a field that included Israel's Tom Beeri. Iran could have faced sanctions from the IOC if Alirezaei pulled out deliberately because an Israeli was also racing, but the IOC said no violation had been found.<br>\"The athlete has withdrawn because of sickness,\" said a spokesman. \"He confirmed this in writing to the swimming federation. We've also spoken with the national Olympic committee and they have underlined to us that all their athletes compete here in the right spirit against athletes from any nationality.\" Iran does not recognize Israel and bans any contact with the Jewish state. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, an Iranian judo athlete did not compete against an Israeli opponent, and Iranian government officials were quoted in state media as congratulating him for doing so.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.40 am:</strong> <strong>Britwatch. </strong> Charlotte Kerwood's Olympics is over, after finishing 16th in the qualifying for the women's trap final. Kerwood made her international debut at the Manchester Commonwealth games at the age of 15, she's a 21 year-old veteran now and a definite maybe for London 2012. Slovakia's Zuzana Stefecekova and Finland's Satu Makela-Nummela led the field.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Good morning, Gary Naylor. </strong> \"Catching up with the MBM Olympic report isn't easy pre-coffee, and is made all the more difficult by surprise medals,\" writes the undisputed Sir Steve Redgrave of the MBM Olympics. \"Things were easier when Team GB used to win just the one gold in the whole Games. This \"another day, another gold\" is all a bit much to be honest. Lewis Hamilton is shelving his Sports Personality of the Year acceptance speech for another year.\" I think Rebecca Aldington will need the 800m as well to secure that Sports Personality nomination, no? But Tom Daley has got the Young Sports Personality sewn up.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.50 AM:</strong> <strong>Brit-in-the-Baltics-perspective.</strong> Robin Hazlehurst in Estonia writes, \"Here in Estonia the national broadcaster has set up a second channel specially to show the Olympics, and now both channels are simultaneously showing beach volleyball, presumably just because Georgia are playing and this is an act of anti-Russian solidarity. There's no other reason, noone here cares about beach volleyball otherwise.\" You know, Kakum\u00e4e, V\u00e4\u00e4na-J\u00f5esuu and Lohusalu... I thought <a href=\"http://www.visitestonia.com/\">Estonia had loads of great beaches</a>? But I digress. No matter where you are, catch up with all the latest from Beijing by signing up for our free mail, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thebeijinger\">The Beijinger</a>.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>6.55 AM:</strong> <strong>Acquatics.</strong> Bryony Shaw has begun her attempt to win a medal in the windsurfing. She has finished fourth in her first race. Plenty more to come.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>6.55 am:</strong> <strong>Tennis.</strong> American tennis goddess Serena Williams has beat Olga Govortsova from Belarus.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>7.00 am:</strong> If, unlike Robin Hazlehurst, you're not watching on Estonian television, Brazil beat Georgia in the beach volleyball 2-0.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>7.05 am:</strong> <strong>Tennis.</strong> Roger Federer just opened his clash with sometime practice partner Dmitry Trusunov by winning a love service game.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>7.20 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>What you've missed if you've just arrived at the office: In a quite brilliant race Britain won it's first female swimming medals for 48 years. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Rebecca Adlington took gold and Joanne Jackson took bronze in the 400m freestyle.</a> But in possibly an even better race, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/michaelphelps.olympicsaquatics\">Michael Phelps</a> kept his eight gold dream alive as the USA pinched France to gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay. Five teams went inside the world record. Amazing stuff. Anyway, get the rest of the news to date by signing up to our free email. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thebeijinger\">The Beijinger</a>. Next up we have Tom Daley in the pool. <a href=\"http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/minder.htm\">Not Minder</a>. But the the 14 year-old diving sensation. <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html\">Paul Kelso</a> is at poolside now.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Not everyone is excited about the diving, though.</strong> Not curmudgeonly Gary Naylor, for example. \"I know the IOC has all kinds of rules and regs (which essentially reduce to \"Will it work on telly?\")\", says Gary. \"But, ontologically, what is sport? For me anything that involves judges awarding points is more suited to a variant of the Eurovision Song Contest rather than the Olympics.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Brit-in-the-antipodes-perspective III.</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>How the Australian media reported Rebecca Adlington's race. \"In the excitement of jumping up and down and going \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" for a while I forgot about the TV commentary on the 400m freestyle, over here in Australia,\" writes Martin Lyons. \"About 200m in (when Rebecca Adlington was last) the Aussie commentator was listing the top 3 swimmers, followed up by hyping the Australian in the race (who eventually came 6th) and then said \"as for the Brit Adlington, she's gone\", to which the other commentator replied \"Yeah, they've chewed her up and spat her out\".\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>7.30 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>Britain are underway. Aldridge and 14 year-old Daley score 52.8 on their first dive. Highly impressive. Just to let you know how it works - there are eight teams in the final - Australia, Cuba, Great Britain, Germany, USA, Colombia, China and Russia. Each pair performs six dives in rotation. China who have won 20 of the 32 titles in Olympic history are red hot favourites. Bronze would be a result for our (literally) boys.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7.40 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>At the end of the first round China, lead from Russia and Australia, Germany and Britain, Blake Aldridge and Tom Daley, are tied fourth. The dives get progressively harder...</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>7.45 am:</strong> And the second Aldridge and Daley dive is a 50.4. This dive is a inward one-and-a-half somersault with pike. To my eyes, a bit out of time. (Though still mind-blowing.)</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>7.50 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>Several million eyes are on a boy from Devon with verruca socks and his partner whose name is destined to be forgotten. (It's Blake Aldridge.) How's he doing? Pretty well. At the end of the second round GB lie sixth. China lead, Russia are second and Australia and Germany are tied third. The Chinese are simply miles ahead. Their pair of divers look like they are tied together by string.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>7.55 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>Aldridge and Daley's third dive is a inward three-and-a-half-somersault tuck. The experts say they messed up the entry into the pool. It's a 72.96. Now it's time for a change in the hot seat. I'm off to bed and in comes Paolo Bandini, who I give a perfect 10.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>8am:</strong> Hello. I'll be tiding you over for the next three hours of tucks, pikes and ... er ... kayaking. All the focus is on the synchronised diving right now, but - if my hastily thrown together schedule is to be believed - we also have 49er and Yngling events kicking off just about now (Team GB involvement alert!), women's 58kg weightlifting and the trap final of the women's shooting.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>8.05am</strong> Fans of our ever-present standfirst (the grey bit underneath the headline) will already have spotted this, but for those who haven't, Paul Kelso is <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html\"> giving the diving a far more knowledgeable treatment in his live blog</a>.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>8.10am</strong><strong>diving</strong> An impressively synchronised triple somersault (\"inward three-and-a-half tuck\", apparently) draws excited praise from our BBC commentary team, but there's a ruffle of the nose from Daley as he and Aldridge are awarded just 75.24 for their efforts. That leaves them seventh.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>8.12am</strong> Are they really playing Cotton-Eye Joe in the Bird's Nest? <em>Really</em>?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>8.16am</strong> I've always figured that a bronze medal must often be more satisfying than a silver. If you finish third then you're probably just going to have been pleased to have picked up a medal at all, rather than dwelling on the fact that you came so close to a gold but didn't get it. As if on cue to back up my half-baked theories, this story about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7715689\">Chinese shooter Zhu Qinan weeping on the podium</a> after picking up silver in the 10m air rifle drops into my lap.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>8.19am</strong> <strong>Diving:</strong> Daley and Aldridge synchronise beautifully again, but they're not entering the water quite right, so again it's only a 77.52. Hopes of a medal are fading.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>8.24am</strong> \"That's an interesting theory you have about coming second/third,\" jabbers Joseph Bennett. \"But isn't the more interesting point here really just how much more pleasant life must be as a lottery-funded Brit rather than a Chinese competitor at these Games. Daley and Aldridge will probably get a heroes' welcome back home if they finish within five places of the podium.\" Yes, that too.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>8.27am</strong> Team GB's women's eight have finished second behind USA (repeat three times for emphasis) in the rowing, and will therefore have to get through the repechage tomorrow if they want a place in the final.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>8.29am</strong> Another splashy entry from the Brits, and they'll be lucky not to finish last now.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>8.37am</strong> \"Daley and Aldridge?\" exclaims Gary Naylor. \"Please don't write it like that. Those of us of a certain age are getting flashbacks to 80s football (Tony Daley and John Aldridge) and it's not very nice.\" It's alright Gary, I won't mention them again now, what with how they've finished in eighth. A dodgy last dive from China gives Russia a shot at gold, but it was only ever an extremely unlikely one and they can't manage it. Instead, Germany leap up to grab silver, and the Russians must settle for bronze. Which will, of course, be far more satisfying (see 8.16am).</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>8.42am</strong> The Beeb is showing replays of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Rebecca Adlington's gold in the 400m freestyle\"</a>, so this seems as good a time as any to plug our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thebeijinger\">informative daily Beijinger email</a>. It's full of fun, facts, and the word 'Olympics'.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.50am</strong> It's 64-64 in the women's preliminary basketball game between Russia and Korea, while the Italian Valentina Vezzali is through to the semi-finals of the women's fencing. If she can parry, riposte and perform various other sword-swishing motions better than fellow Italian Margherita Granbassi in the semi-final, and then one more opponent in the final, she'll become the first Italian ever to win gold at three different Olympics. That opponent could actually be yet another Italian, since Giovanna Trillini is in the other semi-final against Nam Hyunhee.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>9am</strong> Team GB's 49er team Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes are ninth with 41 points, which sounds like quite a lot behind Australia's Nathan Outteridge and Ben Austin on 13, but then I don't really understand how this is scored if I'm being honest. Explanations welcomed and appreciated. My colleague Alan Gardner has just walked in with an outrageous new moustache. It's quite distracting.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>9.05am</strong> The moustache is apparently in honour of Mark Spitz, the American swimmer whose seven gold medals in 1972 set the record which Michael Phelps is now trying to break. Alan thinks <a href=\"http://images.beijing2008.cn/01/75/Img211717501.jpg\">Spitz's was the greatest sporting moustache of all time</a>. For me the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/i/page2/photos/040414hrabosky.jpg\">former Atlanta Braves pitcher Al Hrabowsky</a> takes some beating.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>9.10am</strong> Back to the sailing and Ben Ainslie is doing rather well in the Finn. In fact he's won four of his last five races and is first on just seven points. Not bad for a man who said he was going to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicssailing.olympics2008\">play it safe</a></p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>9.16am</strong> Britain's Alan Campbell is fourth in the quarter-finals of the men's single sculls but moving up through the field ...</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9.17am</strong> And in the end he pushes on to finish a comfortable second behind Germany's Marcel Hacker, who looks very pleased with himself indeed. Hacker has been waiting quite some time to get one over on Campbell, but I dare say the Brit was fairly sensible to just pace himself and settle for second, given that there's still a semi-final and potentially a final to come.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>9.21am</strong> I'm hoping Gary Naylor had his tongue firmly in his cheek when he put forward <a href=\"http://img.skysports.com/08/03/800x600/GaryNeville_724859.jpg\">Gary Neville's shameful attempt at face fluff</a> for our great sporting moustaches contest. France's Gael Monfils is through to the second round of the men's tennis after beating Spain's Nicolas Almagro 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. Britain's very own Andy Murray is up at 10am against Chinese Taipei's Yen-Hsun Lu, who is currently ranked No77 in the world. They have never met before on the ATP Tour.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>9.30am</strong> Al Parkes is not the first person to suggest Merve Hughes for our moustache contest, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2006/12/20/mervehughes_narrowweb__300x361,0.jpg\">but he did include the best link</a>. Those of you wanting a break from all this moustache malarkey could do worse than checking out Barney Ronay's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/premier_league_preview_no11_ma.html\">Premier League preview on Manchester United</a></p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>9.32am</strong> Britain's 'three blondes' - Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson - finished fourth in the fifth race of the women's yngling, leaving them joint-first with the Netherlands on 13 points.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>9.40am</strong> Apologies for the slightly belated reporting here, but Finland's Satu Makela-Nummela took gold in the women's trap shooting earlier on, and even set an Olympic record along the way by hitting 21 targets in the final. Slovakia's Zuzana Stefecekova took silver and USA's Corey Cogdell took bronze.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9.46am</strong> You* will be excited to hear that Italy are through to the finals of the men's archery after crushing Ukraine 223-221. In more sombre news, Anatoly Khrapaty, a weight-lifting gold medallist for the USSR in 1988, has been killed at the age of just 45 in a motorcycle accident. </p> <p>* I</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.50am</strong> It's all coming up Italy right now - I've just found out they've also beaten Russia in a women's water polo preliminary too. Russia finally overcame Korea 77-72 in the women's basketball, while Latvia are 13-12 up against Belarus in the same event.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.54am</strong> Gary Naylor's back, and this time he's angry. \"Women's trap shooting? Why a separate competition,\" he booms. \"Likewise archery and indeed several other sports - anachronistic nonsense. Women and men should compete against each other on a 'level playing field' unless there are proveable physical reasons why the playing field isn't level (eg swimming, athletics etc).\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>10am</strong> The official Beijing website is utterly useless when it comes to sailing results - right now they have nothing up for any of the races, beyond a starting list of competitors and the word 'unofficial' where the results should be. Our super newswires, however, inform me that Ainslie did indeed finish the day in first place as did the women's yngling team \"after another pair of solid performances\". They boast leads of one and three points respectively. In the 49er class, however, Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes, managed to slip from first to ninth despite being the 2007 world champions.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>10.05am</strong> There's windsurfing news too - Britain's Bryony Shaw, who won the test event here last year, is third in the RS:X women's category, while Nick Dempsey is ninth in the men's competition.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>10.10am</strong> \"David Wilkie was just a bit behind Spitz in gold medals and face furniture,\" pipes up Gary Naylor, putting his equal-opportunities bluster behind him to get back to the more pressing issue of facial hair. \"<a href=\"http://cache.viewimages.com/xc/3318044.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=11B127B063386F61C80E5920C1CC8592A55A1E4F32AD3138\">Decent effort on both counts though</a>.\"</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>10.15am</strong> Ah kayaking - like rowing, only better (strong current, white water, high potential for drowning - what's not to like)? Campbell Walsh was supposed to be one of Britain's biggest medal hopes here, having taken silver in Athens, but a dodgy first run, picking up two penalty points. He's ninth at the minute and needs to stay in the top 15 after two runs to progress.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>10.20am</strong> Murray is 2-1 up, but I've been disappointed by the lack of over-enthusiastic middle-England support. Perhaps they're being drowned out by both players' absurdly squeaky shoes. Not enough fist pumping for my liking either.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10.25am</strong> Walsh has finished 14th in the first round of the K1. Not great.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>10.30am</strong> A big thank-you to Gavin Brown, who has pointed me in the direction of <a href=\"www.sailing.org/olympics\">this website</a>, which seems to be fairly comprehensive and up to speed when it comes to the sailing results. They're all done for today now anyway, but will doubtless come in handy again over the next few days. Murray is 3-2 up and the match has so far gone with serve.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10.32 am</strong> Scratch that - Murray just broke for the first time and leads 4-2.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10.34am</strong> China's Chen Yanqing has won the women's 58kg weightlifting competition. They now have eight golds - five more than anybody else. China also claimed bronze in the men's team archery with a 222-219 win over Ukraine. Italy are playing Korea in the final now.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>10.38</strong> More good news for Team GB as David Florence finishes third after two heats in the C1 canoe slalom to make the semi-finals with ease.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>10.43</strong> Britain's men's coxless pair of Robin Bourne-Taylor and Tom Solesbury are out after finishing fourth in the repecharge.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>10.47am</strong> I return to the tennis to find that Murray has now broken Lu twice, only to swiftly drop his own serve on both occasions. He leads 5-4, with Lu serving to stay in the set.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>10.51am</strong> Korea have beaten Italy 227-225 in the final of the men's archery, which by my reckoning puts them second in the gold medal count with four.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>10.55am</strong> Murray really isn't making light work of things against Lu, and he is taken to deuce before holding serve to take a 6-5 lead. Britain's Elise Laverick and Anna Bebington are through to the final of the women's double sculls after winning the repecharge.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>11.05am</strong> The picture is ahead of the sound on the BBC's coverage of the Murray match, which makes for quite an odd viewing experience. I've watched sport before where the opposite is true, but never quite like this. Lu holds to force a tie-break after saving three set points on deuce. Murray's body language is not especially encouraging - it's very hot on court and he looks quite lethargic. He has relied heavily on unforced errors from Lu to this point.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>11.12am</strong> Lu takes the tie-break 7-5 to shrieks of what I can only assume is the Chinese equivalent of \"come on Tim\". It was a bizarre end to the set actually - Murray double-faulted, but there was confusion over whether his second serve had been called in or not and both players were made to hang about for a few minutes while the umpire called the Hawkeye team, only to discover it wasn't working. In the end Murray was told it had been called out, and that would stand. Anyway, Murray is in trouble here - he's really not playing that well. You, however, are in very good hands, as I am now passing this minute-by-minute over to my esteemed colleague Tom Bryant.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>11.20am:</strong> Morning all. As I take over typing duties, Campbell Walsh is bobbing about like a cork in a waterfall in the white waters of canoeing course. He finally crosses the line with 172.44 to come in fifth which should mean he qualifies for the next round - or say they're saying on the telly - I've been watching Andy Murray begin his inevitable first game exit from the Olympics so haven't been concentrating too hard.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>11.25am:</strong> There's wild excitement in the badminton court - or at least you'd think so from the terrifying chanting that appears to be going on there. Brit Andrew Smith is taking on Marc Zwieber and is currently one game up but losing the second 13-9. Andy Murray, meanwhile, is trying to get off the court as it's started raining but the umpire won't let him as he doesn't think it's hard enough.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>11.30am:</strong> In the badminton, Smith (who looks a bit like John Arne Riise) is taking the shuttle early at the front of the court which is a good thing, by all accounts. It doesn't help him save the second game, though, as Zwieber draws level on one game all The furious chanting is still going on but bears no relation to this game, which means there's probably a far more exciting one elsewhere in the building, albeit one that doesn't involve a Brit and is therefore not being shown by the Beeb.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>11.32am:</strong> Ah. An apology. All that badminton happened ages ago. At 4am. And Smith lost badly. That's the peril of assuming that what you're watching is live when it isn't. What a brilliant start I've made to all of this. In other news you may not have caught up on - the allies won the war and England won the 1966 World Cup.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.36am:</strong> Something that very much is happening at the moment is Andy Murray heading into that dark place in his head while some unknown shows him how to play tennis. He's 2-1 down in the second set, having lost the first two games and then breaking back.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.39am:</strong> Murray's problem are - apparently - his short balls. By which, he's not hitting the tennis ball far enough. Why? What were you thinking? Campbell Walsh, in the canoeing, qualified from his heat in ninth place, so that's a good thing.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.44am:</strong> An email. Hurrah. \"Do tennis players really take the Olympics seriously,\" asks Jim Thompson, not unreasonably given Murray's showing so far. \"Is winning a gold medal as important a spur to them as winning at somewhere like Wimbledon?\" I don't think it is, to be honest. I'm always surprised by how many big players turn out - but then, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/tennis.olympics.nadal\">this report from Will Buckley</a>, the Chinese love a bit of tennis.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>11.46pm:</strong> Sharron Davies is talking away on the telly about the fantastic success in the swimming this morning. The BBC cameraman is scrupulously zooming in very closely on her head, not allowing his lens to show anything but her face. <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0,,1677787,00.html\">Wonder why that is</a>.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>11.51am:</strong> \"I think that the tennis players suffer The Olympics because of their sponsors' contracts,\" reckons Gary Naylor. \"They don't seem to care much and (perhaps I'm being charitable) look embarrassed about taking the limelight away from those for whom The Olympics is the pinnacle of their careers.\" Murray certainly looks like he's suffering at the moment - after an epic deuce battle to go back to 2-2 in the second set, he looks absolutely shattered and is spending a good deal of time grimacing as his gammy knee gives him jip.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>11.53am:</strong> Aside from the tennis, there's much going on at the moment. A quick glance shows lots of women in wetsuit-ish swimming costumes ploughing up and down the pool (where Brit Caitlan McClatchey has come second in the 200m freestyle heat), two women in judo suits grappling with each other and others playing hockey, sailing and jabbing at each other with swords. </p> <p>Also, there this: \"I agree with Gary Naylor that there is something not quite right about events which require judges to award points,\" says Paul Smith of the ever prodigious Mr Naylor's comments at just 7.20am this morning - proving that Paul Smith is just as much behind the times as I was a few minutes ago. \"Of more interest/concern though is that, as far as I can work out, diving is the only such event which has not been made into 'Celebrity Synchronised Diving'. No idea who would host it but some of the potential combinations are delicious - both technically and aesthetically.\" Any suggestions?</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>12.05pm:</strong> The featherweight and lightweight boxing preliminaries are underway and Santos from Mexico and Okoth from Kenya are busy knocking seven shades out of each other. The Mexican is 3-2 up after the second round. Meanwhile Federica Pelligrini has just smashed the 200m freestyle world record after clocking 1min 55.45 seconds. Well done her.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> \"Further to the comments of Gary Naylor and Paul Smith re what defines a sport, I would like to say that if you can play it without changing your shoes, its not a sport,\" emails Jimmy Shaker - which, by that reckoning, makes diving a sport as you should probably remove your shoes before entering the pool. My assessment of what makes a sport is whether you can do it with a cigarette in your hand - therefore snooker, darts and cricket are not sports.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> It's going from bad to worse for Murray. Not only is it four games all in the second set, he's also battling fatigue, a bad knee and the inner demons to whom he seems to have started talking - going by the constant muttering with which he's greeting each point.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>12.17pm:</strong> Santos has clinched his bout about against Okoth and, with his face mask off, he appears to be all of about 10 years old. Elsewhere, Italian Giulia Quintavalle has claimed the gold in the women's 57kg judo after beating Deborah Gravenstijn from the Netherlands.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>12.21pm:</strong> World number 77, Lu Yen-Hsu, has just knocked Andy Murray out of the Olympics in straight sets. That really is appalling from Murray. Expect Murray to be referred to as only a Scot rather than a Briton for the next two weeks.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> The commentators are gamely talking up how well Lu Yen-Hsu has played - and rightfully so - but, honestly, Murray played shockingly badly. He barely looked interested, was as mobile as a sloth and seemed never to have really been in this. He'll be out later in the doubles with his brother, so he can have the ignominy of crashing out twice, if he carries on like this.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Ah, the butterfly. The most ludicrous of swimming strokes. And isn't it always brilliant when someone down the municipal pool attempts it while you're lamely doggy paddling down the slow lane? Anyway, there's a 200m butterfly heat underway at the moment and the British interest involves Michael Rock who's not doing badly. In fact, he's done rather well and has finished in third with 1:55.55, which is just outside the British record and is a huge personal best.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.33pm:</strong> \"I think you're being harsh on Andy Murray,\" says Colin Stevens. \"The guy has just come through consecutive weeks of Masters tennis held in baking heat and humidity, winning one and getting to the semis in the other. Peter Fleming early on in the last tournament said that whoever won that would have no chance in the Olympics. Might be why Federer got knocked out early.\" Yeah, but to slump out to the world number 77 so lamely is what's depressing. There was just no fight.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> Phelps is off like a flailing dolphin in his 200m butterfly heat - well, like an extremely effective, winning machine-like flailing dolphin. He hit the turn on 150m in sixth and then came back to win in the last length and casually set a new Olympic record of 1:53.7 while he was at it. Extraordinary.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.39pm:</strong> \"Contrary to your comments, darts appears to be the ultimate sport,\" insists Kevin McKenzie. \"In competitions, you have to wear black shoes at the oche, you can no longer smoke indoors, and theres no judge deciding on your score. Could darts be the ultimate sport?\" Hmm, it's beating cricket under those terms. Meanwhile, Jo Jackson has joined Caitlin McClatchey in the semi-finals of the 200m freestyle after winning bronze this morning in the 400m freestyle. Good on her.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.41pm:</strong> The men's 62kg weightlifting is reaching its exciting pinnacle. There's a lot of shouting, a fair bit of grunting and some very peculiar body-shapes on display. 140kg is where the weight is at currently and a lot of men who I , personally, wouldn't mess with are struggling to lift it.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.47pm:</strong> The Korean Ji Hunmin is the talcum powder and shouting king currently. He's just lifted 142kg, something which the pleasingly alliterative Chinese contender, Zhang Xiangxiang, can't lift it himself, despite the entire crowd roaring at him. Meanwhile Chris Brock has sent me a very amusing email on the subject of one particular person who would make a worrying celebrity diving partner. Unfortunately, unless I want to spend the next few month of my life in court, I can't print it. Pity.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.49pm:</strong> Ah, but Xiangxiang has come out again and had another go, this time lifting 143kg. So, well done him.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> In the judo, Azerbaijan's Elnur Mammadli has clinched gold in the 73kg men's category after taking only 13 seconds to knock teenage world champion Wang Kichun of South Korea out of the reckoning. Tajikistan's Rasul Boqiev won bronze after beating Dirk van Tichelet of Belgium. My advice is to steer clear of all four of them if you ever see them in a bad mood.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.55pm:</strong> Back to the pool, where Brit Keri-Ann Payne has come in seventh in the 200m individual medley heat but was up at the front alongside hot favourite Natalie Coughlin for initial stages. Her time is good but maybe not good enough for the final. Hoff races in the next heat and she'll certainly be the person everyone wants to beat.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.59pm:</strong> Actually, the backstroke is quite silly too. Not as silly as the butterfly, but still fairly silly. Hoff possibly thinks so as her backstroke length lets her down a bit in the fourth of the women's 200m individual medley but, still she comes second to Australian Alicia Coutts. After that heat, Payne has slipped down to tenth but could still make the semis.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>1.04pm:</strong> Back in the boxing - the men's lightweight (60kg) round of 32: Match 4, to be absolutely precise - Domenico Valentino of Italy has creamed Tahar Tamsamani 15-4. He'll have a sore head in the morning. In the pool, Brit Hannah Miley has continued Team GB's good day in the pool by winning heat five of the 200m individual medley in a time of 2:11.72. She looks delighted with herself too, and well she might as she's now fourth in the semi-final. Payne is through too.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> \"Here in Sweden, the telly is showing some boxing where one of the competitors rejoices in the name Prince Octopus Dzaine,\" writes Gary Naylor of the Ghanaian boxer (it says on t'internet) . \"Disappointingly, he has just the two arms.\" It would be something of an unfair advantage should he have had eight, though extremely entertaining to warch.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>1.12pm:</strong> Bix Mistry has suggested: \"Dawn French and Peter Crouch, Darth Vader and an Ewok or Robert Mugabe and Gordon Brown,\" for the celebrity diving. I'd rather see Cristiano Ronaldo and Didier Drogba - they're certainly got form. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.18pm:</strong> Nikoloz Izoria and Thato Batshegi, from Georgia and Botswana respectively, are clattering each other all over the boxing ring. The Georgian is 10-4 ahead in the second round but manages to find time to stop and do up his shoe laces. He's also got a nasty graze under his eye. Bathshegi is going at him like a drunk on a Saturday night - all agression, flailing arms, wild attacks and not much contact - while Izoria is concentrating on actually doing some boxing.</p> <p>Unfortunately for British badminton player Tracey Hallam, her Olympics are over. She's been knocked out by Xu Huaiwen who, despite her name, mystifyingly appears to be from Germany.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.24pm:</strong> Batshegi has decided he's had enough of being punched in the head and has, instead, decided to wrestle Izoria to the ground. I'm no boxing expert but I'd say that's probably not Queensberry Rules. Next he batters the Georgian around the back of the head, which doesn't seem quite right either. </p> <p>On the subject of sports with judges, Phil Mannion has this to say: \"I once passed an enjoyable afternoon in the pub with a friend thinking of ways judging could be eliminated from sport. Most of our innovations now escape me, but I've always thought our re-imagining of synchronised swimming as a gruelling endurance slog, where the winners are the last team still underwater-pirouetting when the rest have given up/drowned, was potentially the same sort of televisual gold as Touch The Truck with Dale Winton.\"</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.27pm:</strong> The referee has decided that the slight bruising to Izoria's eye is enough to stop the bout for a bit. He seems less concerned by the Botswanan's attempts to turn this into a wrestling contest, however. The scoring seems a bit iffy, too. Batshegi finally connected with a good punch and failed to score, before Izoria does the same three times more and doesn't get a point either. It finishes 14-4 to the Georgian.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.28pm:</strong> U-S-A, U-S-A are stomping all over China in the women's basketball and are currently up 45-14 with five minutes remaining in the half. Which half? I'm not sure at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.33pm:</strong> The Chinese are not going down without a fight though. Despite being about half the size of most of the Americans, they're giving it good go. It's not going to work though, I'd wager. U-S-A, U-S-A are now 54-22 ahead with only a minute and half to go of the half. Which half? Still don't know.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.37pm:</strong> Ah, it was the first half. China are out of this already. Let's move on somewhere else.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>1.38pm:</strong> Apologies again. It appears the website is not updating. So all of these carefully worded vignettes have not been appearing, which has probably only improved the overall report. Whether this apology will also appear is also in doubt - but it's the thought that counts, eh?</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.45pm:</strong> Good lord, they're still lifting insane weights in what I can only presume is called the weight-lifting arena. Alliterative dream, Zhang Xiangxiang, is attempting to lift 184kg - a weight that would be a new world record. He's already the gold medal winner. He approaches the stand, looking knackered, scoops the weights up to his neck ... and ... drops them back on the floor, unable to lift them any higher. Still, that was a very impressive contest from the Chinaman.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.48pm:</strong> Ah, it would appear the site is working again. Good stuff. Right, in the men's 62kg weightlifting, the winner is Zhang Xiangxiang, Diego Salazar of Colombia can hang the silver medal from his mantelpiece, while Indonesia's Triyatno will have to settle for bronze.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.55pm:</strong> It's U-S-A, U-S-A against Romania in the boxing ring in the shape of Georgian Popescu v American teenager Sadam Ali and it's shaping up to be quite a bout for the Romanian. He's absolutely clonking Ali and has landed some weighty lefts on Ali's face - enough to knock the American to the floor. Going into the third round, Popescu leads 9-3, which means yet another American boxer could be on his way home.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.58pm:</strong> As boxing contests go, this is not the most technically brilliant. There have been one or two air shots, some wild, whirling arms and the odd landed punch - mostly from the American. In return, he's getting a real whooping. Popescu is absolutely killing him. At the end of the third, the Romanian leads 16-5. Ali needs a knockout or a miracle to stay in this.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>2.03pm:</strong> Some fencing news: Margherita Granbassi from Italy has beaten fellow Italian Giovanni Trillini to the bronze medal in the women's individual foil by 15 points to 12. Meanwhile, Popescu has finished his demolition of Ali and will no doubt take a certain amount of pleasure in having sent the second American boxer of the contest back home.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2.07pm:</strong> Ah - the mystery of the badminton player who is mystifyingly German despite all the evidence of her name name has been solved. Xu Huaiwen was a Chinese citizen who was dropped by the Chinese team because she was too short. She moved to Germany, got into their team, and is now back in China showing her homeland what they have missed out on. None of which changes things for Briton Tracey Hallam, who Xu beat, as she's still on her way home.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>2.12pm:</strong> Having written the Chinese women basketball players off, they're doing their best to make me eat my words. At the end of the third quarter they've fought back to leave the score at 46-81 to U-S-A. They can still count on packing their unfeasibly long t-shirts and shorts tonight but they'll do so having put on a decent showing.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.17pm:</strong> There's some hot breaking women's beach volleyball news ... well, it's news, anyway. In the preliminary competition, pool C, match 3, Ana Paula Connelly and Larissa Franca (Brazil) beat Paula Uryadova and Alexandra Shiryaeva (Russia) 2-1 (19-21 21-12 15-13). Take that down the pub and impress your mates.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.20pm:</strong> Elsewhere, Maria Valentina Vezzali has won he women's individual foil gold after beating South Korea's Nam Hyun-hee (who took silver). She's a bit special, is Maria Valentina and this gold means she's taken that medal home at three individual Olympics. Sort of like the Steve Redgrave of Italy. But in fencing. And not quite as good.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> The tennis courts are swelteringly hot - leading to players having to change their shirts constantly throughout. That's the reason Murray did so badly earlier, apparently. Hmmm. On the court at the moment Svetlana Kuznetsova is a set down against Li Na, but two games up in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> We'll see just how worn out Andy Murray is when he comes on to the court alongside brother Jamie a bit later on. Meanwhile Li Na is banking on home support to get her through her match against Kuznetsova. The Chinese woman is absolutely throwing the kitchen sink at her rival and, so far, it seems to be working.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> \"Grrr,\" \"Ungghh,\" \"Oof,\" \"Owwwll,\" or noises to that affect are what you'd be hearing if you were watching Kuznetsova try and get back on level terms with Li Na, where the score is now two games-all in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.44pm:</strong> Valentina Vezzali says her unprecedented fencing success is down to her son Pietro. \"I have to first off all thank my little boy Pietro,\" without going on to elaborate. Still, that's her third successive gold and sixth overall - the most for any female fencer ever.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>2.49pm:</strong> Bad news in the tennis - well, bad news if you happen to be defending men's doubles champions Fernando Gonzalez and Nicolas Massu of Chile. They were beaten 7-6 6-4 by Russians Dmitry Tursunov and Mikhail Youzhny. In Athens Gonzalez and Massu won Chile its first ever gold medal but obviously couldn't repeat the feat again. The Murrays are due up in five minutes - any predictions for how many times Andy will shout at his older brother?</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.56pm:</strong> It's bad news for Kuznetsova, too. She's looking thoroughly deflated. Despite being the world number 3, she's in the process of crashing out of the Olympics to the Chinese number two Li Na. \"The question is not how many times Andy Murray will shout at his brother but how soon,\" reckons Tim carter. \"I'm banking on the abuse starting in the changing room.\"</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>2.58pm:</strong> Li Na, who has barely cracked a smile all match, doesn't appear to be dropping the hardman exterior now. She looks positively stony-faced as she fails to finish this match off. She's 5-3 up in the second set and stuck on deuce. Meanwhile, U-S-A have finally completed their rout over the Chinese women's basketball team, winning 108-63. That was probably quite inevitable.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> Kuznetsova comes back to win the game, bringing the score to 5-4. In the background, Chumbawumba's (whose tour bus I once climbed into, for no real reason) Tubthumping blares out of the arena's PA. I cannot think of a single reason why that should be.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>3.04pm:</strong> And Li Na's finally done it and has won in straight sets. Well done her. Still doesn't make her smile though. Should you want to know what it's like to row at the Olympics, you could do a lot worse than clicking <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/one_down_two_to_go_in_my_quest.html\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>3.07pm:</strong> The Murrays are on court and facing Canadian pairing Daniel Nestor and Frederic Nestor. Andy looks knackered, Jamie not so much. But, despite a stunning series of net-cord volleying from the Murrays when 15-30 up in the first game, the Canadians go on to get th first points on the board.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> It's a game-all now in the men's doubles, and there's been a disappointing lack of on-court shouting so far. Ah well, there's still time.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>3.17pm:</strong> In the cricket, Freddie Flintoff has just won the game for England with a big, straight six, so England win by six wickets. In Beijing, Albert Selimov, the favourite in the featherweight division, has just been knocked out - of the competition, not knocked unconscious - by Ukraine's Vasyl Lomachenko. That'll hurt.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>3.19pm:</strong> Rather than shouting, the Murrays are whispering to each other behind their hands like the Williams sisters. It seems to be working as every one of the four games they've played has gone with serve. It's 2-2 and Andy Murray has already got quite a sweat on.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> It's with a peculiar \"Phheee\" sound that Nestor unleashes his serves. It seems to do the trick, though. He wins that game for the Canadians to love. The arena is virtually empty, showing you just how much the Chinese care about this. Andy Murray then slaps down a decent, if half-hearted, service game to level the scores at 3-3 again. I'm not sure he really cares much about this.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>3.29pm:</strong> The Canadian pair, rather than just whisper under their breath, are indulging in a series of complicated hand signals which seem to be confusing them as much as anything else. It's like doing semaphore to a blind man. It means the Murrays get themselves three break points - all of which they blow - before the game goes to deuce and the Canadians hold serve again.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>3.34pm:</strong> There are a pitiful handful of spectators watching this game - all of whom seem to be middle-aged women from the home counties. Strange. They watch on as Jamie Murray holds his serve, taking the score to 4-4 in the first set. Russia, meanwhile, have beaten Sweden 28-24 in the handball preliminary round, you'll be pleased to learn.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>3.41pm:</strong> It would appear the site has gone down again. Bah. Stay with us, it'll get better. Maybe. </p> <p>Canada survive a Murray pummeling, thanks to Nestor's excellent anticipation. What appeared to be an unplayable Andy Murray shot down the line was amazingly returned by the Canadian. Two points later, with the scores at deuce, Andy lets out his first shout. \"Rraarrr,\" he yells as he screws his shot into the net. He does the same thing a little later when he puts another into the net as Canada take the game. The score's 5-4 to them, now.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> Facing three set points, after going 0-40 down at 4-5, Andy Murray throws the ball into the air and smashes it far too long. His second serve goes straight into the net and the Canadians claim the first set. Murray 'celebrates' by smashing his racket into the ground, while his brother just looks despairing.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Should you get tired of the, ahem, word pictures being drawn here, you can look at actual pictures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/11/olympics2008\">here</a> of the best shots from day three of the Olympics. On the court, you'd struggle to find anyone looking less bothered than the Murray's right now. Despite Andy's ocasional shouts and racket slams, they don't look like they could care less. Having said that, they have just broken the Canadians in the first game of the second set.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>3.54pm:</strong> Sean Ingle has spent much of his afternoon chasing new British swimming hero Rebecca Adlington around Beijing. The results? He rekons she's quite nice. You can make your own mind up by following <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/the_joy_of_the_olympics_is_how.html\">this link</a>, of course.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>3.57pm:</strong> Finally, the Murrays are beginning to make a fist of this. They fight back from 15-40 down to get to deuce - courtesy of a Nestor double fault - but can't go on to break the pair again. It's 2-1 to the Murrays who are still a set down in the second set. Meanwhile long-jumper Chris Tomlinson has passed a fitness test and has been passed fit to compete in Beijing - which is good news.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> Hmm, or perhaps I've spoken too soon. The next game, on Andy's serve, finds the brothers at 0-40 down. They fight back to 30-40 but a brilliant return from Nestor brings the scores level. That's the second service game that Andy Murray has lost.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>4.03pm:</strong> The Murrays break back, as the strains of a cover version of Sweet Child O'Mine blare from the speakers in the empty tennis arena. The score is 3-2 to the Scottish pair in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> Jamie Murray just about manages to cling on to his serve, taking the score to 4-2. It really is extraordinary how few people are watching this game. It may not be the greatest game tennis has ever seen but Andy Murray is a big name and Nestor, for one, is a very good doubles player so you'd have thought it would be more of a draw than it's proving. Perhaps it needs more trick shots - something Andy tries when he returns a Nestor forehand by facing the wrong way and playing the ball behind his back.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>4.16pm:</strong> After the Canadians hold their serve, the Murrays maintain their advantage after a a brutal, two-handed forehand club from the net from Jamie Murray wins them the next game. They're 5-3 up in the second set now and facing Niemeyer's serve.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> The Murrays land themselves with two set points but can do nothing with the first when Niemeyer forces Jamie Murray wide with his serve. His lobbed return is smashed back by Nestor before Niemeyer serves up an ace to Andy take the score to deuce. From deuce, the Murrays battle to advantage and win the second set. Game on.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> The first people to jump on the/cash in on the Adlington band-wagon are ... Sherwood Swimming Baths in Mansfield Woodhouse. The pool at which the Olympic gold medallist learned to swim aged six will be closed down and reopened as the Rebecca Adlington Swimming Centre, according to the town mayor. Adlington will also be pleased to know she will be able to do such things as drive sheep through the city centre when she's given the Freedom Of Mansfield, too. That medal will soon begin to look worthless in the face of such honours.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> The first two games of the set go with service, making the score 1-1, though Niemeyer's serve is looking ever-more vulnerable. The Murrays still don't look particularly interested in this but at least they're putting together some decent shots now. They are, however, barely looking or talking to each other - leading to speculation in the commentary box that Jamie is worried about annoying Andy and sending him into a rage after his defeat this morning.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>4.35pm</strong> Nestor has to battle to win his serve after finding himself staring down the wrong end of a 0-40 scoreline. The Canadians get back to 15-40, before Nestor double faults and the Murrays go 3-1 ahead.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>4.38pm:</strong> The Murrays have this within their sights now. They're now 4-1 up in the final set and, despite both looking as glum as octogenarian pessimists, they're finally got their mojo working. They've also got Niemeyer's serve to face, which has been weak so far.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>4.45pm:</strong> But Niemeyer holds his serve for once, forcing Andy Murray into s service game in which both Canadians return well. A mistake by Jamie Murray at the net doesn't much help his brother's cause. Andy decides to blast a couple of serves instead and the result is that the Murrays take the game and go into a 5-2 lead. It's 11.45pm in Beijing at the moment - which perhaps explains why nobody is watching this.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>4.48pm:</strong> A delicate drop shot down the line takes the Canadians to 40-15 and prolongs this match by another game. After typing solidly for six hours, I could have done without that, to be honest. Bah. Hopefully Jamie Murray can serve it out for the win nd we can all go home.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>4.53pm:</strong> An ace at 15-15 from Jamie starts the ball rolling but then, at 30-15, they concoct some elaborate plan that involves much talking behind hands before cocking up the point like clowns. Next minute the Canadians are 30-40 up and the damn match looks like it will never die. Then, just as it's all going wrong, Andy Murray dives across the net and slams Niemeyer's return home with a war cry. It's deuce ...</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>4.54pm:</strong> ... and inevitably the Canadians break back and prolong this misery. It's 5-4 to the Murrays in the third set.</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> A double fault from Niemeyer. Yes! That helps. He follows it up by sticking a half-volley into the net. 0-30 to the Murrays.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>4.59pm:</strong> With a sharp forehand, Andy Murray takes the score to 0-40 and brings the demise of this damn game nearer ... until the Canadians ruin it by having the temerity to win a point from their own serve. Then, ridiculously, they do it again. But, finally, the Murrays claim the win and they're through to the next round. You'd have thought that would cheer Andy Murray up after his loss earlier. From the grimace on his face, you'd be wrong.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>5pm:</strong> And with that, so ends this epic Olympic minute-by-minute. Thanks for all your emails - join as again for another one, which we'll be gearing up at around 2am tomorrow morning.</p>",
  "<p>Refugees continued to pour out of South Ossetia yesterday, risking snipers, aerial bombardment and tanks to reach safety across the border.</p> <p>In the centre of Vladikavkaz, the capital of the neighbouring Russian republic of North Ossetia, refugees crowded on to buses to be dispatched to hotels and sanatoria on the Black Sea coast. </p> <p>There were women holding infants, children and pensioners in nightclothes who fled as Georgian troops entered their villages.</p> <p>Many had travelled hours across rocky roads through the mountains to escape the war. Alisa Mamiyeva, 26, a teacher at the arts lyceum in the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, said: \"I came in the boot of a car. Georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest. I heard the bullets hitting the chassis.</p> <p>\"My brother stayed to fight. Our grandparents' home was turned to rubble. We don't know where they are. Nothing is left of their village. It was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire.\"</p> <p>The Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, visited refugees near Vladikavkaz on Saturday, declaring a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" had taken place. He said 22,000 Ossetian refugees had crossed the border into Russia. Tent camps and a field hospital manned by surgeons and psychologists have been set up close to the border.</p> <p>Anatoly Gabarayev, 65, a registered schizophrenic who lived alone in Tskhinvali, stood waiting near a bus with two crumpled plastic bags at his feet. \"It's a living hell there,\" he said, looking blankly into the distance. \"I got out this morning. A friend found me and brought me out on the back of his motorbike. I was already waiting for death in my basement. The city is in ruins. There are bodies lying in the street.\"</p> <p>He added: \"All I have left is the clothes I'm standing in and these two bags. My house was wooden; it was turned to splinters by the shells. I climbed out of the ruins. I don't know where I will go. I don't know what to do.\"</p> <p>A woman dressed in a nightgown and slippers from Khubis Ubani village said: \"I saw our house in flames as we ran. There's nothing left for us to go back to. Our lives are ruined.\" As she spoke, her elderly husband collapsed to the ground, suffering from a heart condition. Police called an ambulance and he was driven away.</p> <p>Aelita Dzhioyeva, a lawyer who fled South Ossetia on Thursday, said she had managed to call relatives in the city on their mobile phones. \"The situation is dire,\" she said. \"People have no water, no electricity, no gas and no food.\"<br>She added: \"My relatives told me Georgian soldiers burnt to death a family of seven people in their apartment. An 18-year-old boy who climbed out into the street for a few moments was shot dead by a sniper.\"</p> <p>At a registration point in the North Ossetian town of Alagir several hundred refugees had gathered, mostly women, many with infants in their arms.</p> <p>Luize Dzagoyeva, 36, a hairdresser, said she had left Tskhinvali at dawn in the back of a truck which came under mortar fire as it travelled north. \"We sat for four days in a cellar, without food and water,\" she said. \"When we came out we saw the whole street had burnt down. The city was gone \u2013 only ruins were left. It was a slaughter. First they bombed and shelled us. Then the tanks came in and levelled the city to the ground.\"</p> <p>\"I don't know what I will do now. My town no longer exists. My brother is still there fighting.\"</p> <p>Marianna Chibirova said she had fled to Tskhinvali from her village and hid in a basement. \"When the firing died down I ran out to the home of my relatives on a different street,\" she said. \"I saw that the city hospital was completed destroyed, and around it lay corpses and injured people, a lot of them. And the injured lay there dying for three days because no one could get to them.\"</p> <p>At a field hospital close to the registration point surgeons attended to wounded soldiers. One South Ossetian serviceman was furious that Russia had not intervened to help earlier.</p> <p>\"Where was Russia?\" he shouted. \"Where were the Russian troops for the first three days? Now they say on television that Russia defended us, they saved South Ossetia, but that's rubbish. </p> <p>\"Russian tanks only came this morning when we had already pushed the Georgian forces out of Tskhinvali. We did it \u2013 Ossetians, ourselves, at the cost of many lives. And Russia came only at the end to take up positions that we had already won. And now I'm lying here and my friends go on dying there.\"</p> <p>In a suburb of northern Vladikavkaz, hundreds of volunteer fighters gathered at a temporary dispatching point to be loaded onto minibuses bound for Tskhinvali.</p> <p>In a reference to Georgian traders working in Russia, a sign on the door read: \"Ossetian patriots! First let us cleanse our markets of Georgian spies! Then forward to liberate the homeland!\"</p> <p>\"We are sending men who have done military service so teenage lads don't go to die,\" said an army colonel helping coordinate the recruitment process. As he spoke a group of 30 tough-looking fighters in camouflage and webbing trooped out of the yard.</p> <p>Sasha Khugayev, 48, said he had left South Ossetia on Friday: \"In Tskhinvali you can't find one brick standing on top of another. The city is still disputed. There are Georgian strong-points on the hills surrounding it. I'm going back to fight tonight. I've got my own team of guys.\"</p> <p>Nearby stood Gennady Dzhioyev, 38, unemployed. He said: \"My cousin came from Dmenis village last night. He got two bullets in the back. We're going to go there and slaughter the Georgians like the fascist pigs they are. If the Russians let us we'll smash them all the way to Tbilisi. We are a warrior race, we know how to fight.\"</p> <p>To one side Alan Kokoyev, 48, an Ossetian Cossack, calmly cleaned his teeth with a flickknife. \"I got here from Tskhinvali this morning,\" he said. \"The Georgians hit our positions with Grad missiles.
