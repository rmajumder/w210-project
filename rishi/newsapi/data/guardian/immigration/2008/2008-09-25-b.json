  "<p>Earlier this week, Michael Moore put his Slacker Uprising online for Americans to download free. On its heels comes another get-out-and-vote movie, this one a comedy starring Kevin Costner as a beer-drinking waster called Bud who gets the deciding vote in the US election after an electronic voting glitch. It wasn't even him in the polling booth, either, but his civically minded 12-year-old daughter, while Bud was passed out; this makes for some glutinously sentimental family drama. But away from the cutesy stuff there are some surprisingly sharp digs at the political process, with Kelsey Grammer as the incumbent Republican president and Dennis Hopper playing his Democrat challenger. This pair never look so grubby as when they're sucking up to Bud, holding their noses while they do it, and furiously U-turning on everything from immigration to gay marriage to win him over. But the basic message puts the handcuffs on anything too risky. Bud is just a Frank Capra little guy, reminding politicians that deep down we all want things to be a bit, well, less bad.</p>",
  "<p>German violinist Carolin Widmann has already established a formidable reputation, but as this thrilling collection of Schumann's violin sonatas shows, she is by no means just a new-music specialist. These constantly sharp-witted performances with Denes Varjon are now among the best available on disc, ranking alongside the versions by Gidon Kremer and Martha Argerich on Deutsche Grammophon. Unlike that stellar partnership, though, Widmann and her pianist include the Third Violin Sonata as well, the work without an opus number that Schumann completed in 1853, three years after the first two sonatas. It's more uneven than its predecessors - Schumann was committed to an asylum just three months after it was finished - but Widmann and Varjon show that the best of it is as buoyantly original as anything in the earlier works. Every bar in both of those seems freshly moulded in their performances, as if Schumann had rolled back the years to the surging lyricism of two decades before.</p>",
  "<p>The design of the UK's new identity card - to be issued from November, initially to foreign nationals - was revealed by the home secretary yesterday.</p> <p>Brandishing an example of the baby pink and pale blue polycarbonate document, Jacqui Smith promised it would combat identity theft, help prevent illegal immigration and enable people to prove their identity more easily.</p> <p>More than 50,000 cards are expected to be handed out to foreign nationals from outside Europe between November and March as they extend their visas and register marriages or civil partnerships. </p> <p>From next year ID cards will be given first to those in security-sensitive roles and by 2010 the aim will be to encourage young people to enrol. They will not be compulsory for the general population.</p> <p>The size of a credit card, each ID card bears a digital image of the holder, their name, the place and date of the card's issue, a signature and a unique identity number. For foreign nationals there is also a \"type of permit\" section showing the person's visa category as well as a \"valid until\" date showing how long the holder has permission to stay in the UK.</p> <p>On the reverse, the card carries an electronic chip recording biometric details including fingerprints. The holder's gender, date and place of birth and nationality are recorded above a section entitled Remarks that lists entitlements.</p> <p>One embedded background symbol is a royal crest, rather than the union flag; the other is a bull meant to depict the form the Greek god Zeus took when he abducted Europa - a nod to the EU. </p> <p>There are numerous security features, incorporating raised numbers, optically variable ink which changes colour as the cards is tilted and a raised plant stem from which the UK's national flowers - rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock - grow. The final design of the ID card for UK citizens will be broadly similar but is likely to be in a different colour, may not have the EU bull motif and will dispense with several of the information categories specific to foreign nationals.</p> <p>Explaining the absence of the union flag, Smith said that no other ID card in the EU carried the design of a national flag. She did not expect that airport workers would refuse to accept ID cards and therefore lose their jobs. </p> <p>David Davis, the former shadow home secretary who resigned over what he alleged was the creation of a \"database state\", said: \"It is typical of this government to kickstart their misguided and intrusive ID scheme with students and foreigners - those who have no choice but to accept the cards - and it marks the start of the introduction of compulsory ID cards for all by stealth.\"</p> <p>Chris Huhne, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said ID cards would \"prove to be a laminated poll tax\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337991444\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/25/ID-CARD_2609-.gif\" alt=\"ID-CARD_2609-.gif\" width=\"471\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>Broadcasting unions yesterday threatened strike action after Ofcom approved plans to restructure ITV's regional news services in a move that could mean hundreds of job losses. The media regulator agreed to the network's plans to cut its 17 regional news services in England and the Scottish borders to nine to save about \u00a340m a year. </p> <p>Ofcom also confirmed that Channel 4 faced an urgent funding problem, and said that a new \"competitive funding\" model that would distribute public money to a range of the BBC's rivals, perhaps including pay-TV broadcasters such as Discovery, remained a serious possibility. </p> <p>Research from Ofcom showed that three-quarters of viewers were prepared to pay \u00a33.50 a month to maintain public service competition to the BBC. </p> <p>ITV has not commented on how many jobs would be lost through the changes but the National Union of Journalists said yesterday the overall figure could be 500. </p> <p>Under the plans, the Border region will merge with Tyne Tees, West with Westcountry, and Meridian with Thames Valley. In each case, there will be a 15-minute slot for more localised news. In other regions, this \"opt out\" will be shorter, at around six minutes. ITV will also be able to merge its studios to save money. </p> <p>The regulator said its reforms were aimed at maintaining the strength of ITV's provision in prime time while recognising the financial pressure it faced because of the slump in TV advertising and increased competition. ITV had warned that if it did not get the go-ahead to restructure its regional services, it would simply reduce a \u00a3100m investment by \u00a340m. </p> <p>Broadcasting unions immediately accused Ofcom of caving in to ITV's demands and failing to stand up for viewers. Viewers in the south of Scotland will be guaranteed just six minutes of news from their region each day, leading some Scots MPs to call for a rethink. Critics said the new \"regional\" areas would be too big and insisted that ITV could not make \u00a340m of savings without affecting quality. </p> <p>Ofcom's chief executive, Ed Richards, said the regulator had no power to force ITV to maintain investment but that by making it concentrate investment on peak time, quality would be maintained. </p> <p>The watchdog has estimated that by 2012, the cost of ITV fulfilling its public obligations will outweigh the benefits by \u00a360m. Already, the network has cut back on output such as children's TV and current affairs. Ofcom is concerned that ITV could hand its licence back. </p> <p>ITV's chairman, Michael Grade, claims the structure as it stands is unsustainable. But journalists say they were left in limbo during a year of consultation and that further cuts are bound to follow. </p> <p>For viewers - those growing up with familiar faces on programmes such as Lookaround, North East Tonight, and Granada Reports - the fear is that this move could spell the final cutting of broadcasters' ties with the audience. </p> <p>Gerry Morrissey, Bectu's general secretary, accused Ofcom of an \"abdication of its duties\" for failing to take account of complaints from viewers and MPs. He said the consultation was \"a sham\". </p> <p>Morrissey added: \"ITV's proposals will wreck their own output and future services will be far less meaningful to audiences. How can a service which covers the area from Penzance to Tewkesbury be considered local? How can you pretend to be offering something valuable to the Border audience, whose region stretches from Dumfries to Yorkshire, in 15 minutes a day? These proposals mark the beginning of closure on ITV's strong record as a regional broadcaster.\"</p> <p>But Stewart Purvis, the former ITN editor in chief, who is partner of content and standards at Ofcom, said the changes were the only way to sensibly safeguard ITV regional news provision until 2014. He accused unions of being obsessed with where coverage was produced. \"If the money is better spent on journalists and camera crews ... that has to be a better use of money,\" he said. </p> <p>ITV welcomed the move and said it would continue to campaign for other forms of regulatory relief, including reform of the rules that govern the way the network's advertising is sold. </p> <p>Beyond the digital switchover in 2012, a funding solution had to be found, said Ofcom, to provide news from the country and regions, as well as other types of public service content. Its document explores ways to maintain public service competition to the BBC and points to four \"credible\" funding models that could help fill the gap in public funding - which could be \u00a3145m-\u00a3235m by 2012. </p> <p>The idea of top-slicing the licence fee by redistributing \u00a3130m a year from the digital switchover help scheme after 2012 remains on the table. However, Richards said: \"We are not in favour of top slicing where [it] means undermining, cutting or jeopardising core BBC programmes and services. [But] the switchover surplus is in a completely different category - it has no impact on the BBC's core programmes and services budget.\"</p> <h2>The models</h2> <p><strong>Ofcom's three potential models for public service broadcasting after 2012</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Evolution: the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Five retain their public service obligations. ITV focuses on UK content and international news. Channel 4 gets extended remit and additional funding. Five's role limited to children's programming and news. </p> <p>Additional funding for news in the nations and regions.</p> <p>\u2022 BBC/Channel 4: ITV and Five lose their public service status and become purely commercial animals. The BBC and Channel 4 get public funding and regulatory assets. Funding for other areas, including news for the nations and regions and children's content, opened up to a range of providers. </p> <p>\u2022 Competitive funding: bidding from providers such as digital channels, existing pubic service broadcasters, newspapers and internet players, which could all apply to deliver a public service. In an example given by Ofcom, a contract to provide regional news could last for six years. </p> <p><strong>Ofcom funding models to fill a \u00a3145m-\u00a3235m gap after 2012</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Licence fee: \u00a3130m a year \"digital switchover surplus\" is retained.</p> <p>\u2022 Taxation: government steps in. </p> <p>\u2022 A stake for other broadcasters: for instance, Channel 4 in BBC Worldwide. </p> <p>\u2022 Exchange: rivals of the BBC win privileged access to the airwaves in return for content. </p> <p>\u2022 Industry levy: imposed on pay-TV providers, commercial broadcasters, electronic devices, etc. </p> <p>\u2022 Combination of the above.</p>",
  "<p>On a flight to Mexico in 1969 the England manager, Sir Alf Ramsey, approached a laughing Allan Clarke. \"Enjoying yourself, Allan?\" he asked. The Leeds forward replied that he was. Ramsey glowered at him, \"You don't enjoy yourself with me. Remember that,\" he snarled.</p> <p>Ramsey's attitude to most things was mired in the past but you can't help feeling that in this respect at least he was looking to the future. Forty years on and nobody in top-level football seems to be enjoying themselves much. Far from having fun most are so filled with wrath and resentment they make Jimmy Porter look like Woody Woodpecker. They seethe on the touchlines and rant in the tunnel. Their autobiographies are so filled with bitter recrimination it's a wonder the pages don't melt. </p> <p>In Sir Alf's time footballers actually seemed pleased when they scored a goal. Some even went so far as to appear genuinely thrilled. When Francis Lee got his \"very interesting\" goal for Derby County against Manchester City he sprinted across the Baseball Ground with the gleeful expression of a puppy that's just stolen a string of sausages. </p> <p>When footballers score these days they don't appear happy about it at all, though. In fact it seems to make them very, very cross. The scorer rushes toward his supporters, chin jutting forward, fists clenched, veins on his neck bulging like rigatoni, yelling in anger. If scoring makes them this mad you can't help wondering why they keep doing it. Why not just stay back in their own half, where the likelihood of popping the ball in the net is greatly reduced?</p> <p>The outsider might imagine that since scoring clearly fills the players with fury then missing a simple chance would have the opposite effect, sending the man who slices wide of a gaping goal skipping across the greensward whistling a merry tune. Nothing could be further from the truth, however. No, instead the player falls to the turf and pounds the ground with his fists in a frenzy of despair. Scoring makes footballers angry and not scoring breaks their hearts. Is it any wonder they are so very irritable all the time?</p> <p>Dealing with the truculence is the referees, and they are not finding it easy. This summer they introduced the Get On With The Game scheme. This is currently proving so ineffective that already the FA and Premier League are talking about updating it with a Get On With The Game This Instant Or I'm Packing It Away And You Can Just Sit There With Your Legs Crossed And Your Arms Folded Until Home Time scheme.</p> <p>Respect is the keyword. Everyone in football talks about respect endlessly. On Monday Keith Hackett of the Professional Game Match Officials Board (which always sounds to me like an organisation that runs upmarket casinos, or international sporting clubs, as they prefer to style themselves) used the word respect so often it was like he was auditioning for a part in The Godfather: Part IV. I was sure that at any moment he'd draw his hand over his mouth and mumble, \"You come to me on the occasion of my daughter's wedding . . .\"</p> <p>That scourge of authority (just so long as it isn't paying his wages) Sir Alex Ferguson insists that Hackett is not being entirely truthful when he says: \"It is just business. It is not personal.\" Hackett, however, refuses to be drawn into a vendetta. \"We're not using a big hammer here,\" he said this week. Many may feel that is partly the problem and that discipline will not be restored until they not only use a very large hammer but also a huge lug wrench and a size-12 sock filled with ball-bearings as well.</p> <p>The managers, unsurprisingly, side with the players, producing a list of mitigation so extensive you expect that at some point one is going to say: \"He's a young lad, passions are high, he hasn't been sleeping well, his routine's been all disrupted, I think he may be coming down with something because his tummy's a bit runny and, of course, it was his father's turn to have him this weekend, which means he's been stuffed full of sweets and junk food and allowed to play unsuitable video games till all hours of the night, so there no wonder he's gone totally hyper, frankly.\"</p> <p>What is most surprising in all this is that while we hear a lot about punishing players for bad behaviour, nobody ever recommends rewarding them when they behave well. Yet is that not the course recommended by most child psychologists? Currently we are all stick. We need to offer a carrot. Not literally a carrot, obviously. Maybe an organic fruit bar, or riding lessons. Yes, in my view it is time that instead of dealing with disciplinary matters behind closed doors the FA should introduce a Premier League equivalent of the star chart system and fix it on a giant fridge door where everybody can see it.</p> <p>\"As a reward for three weeks of being really nice and helpful the FA today announces that Rio Ferdinand will be allowed to play against Chelsea on Saturday. However, we're afraid that though Wayne Rooney did quite well up to a point, he still hasn't got enough stars to fill the first line so we're only letting him on for 15 minutes right at the end.\" </p> <p>If we made playing the game a privilege, behaviour would surely improve. And who knows, the players might even cheer up a bit.</p>",
  "<p>I'm on my way to Memphis, heading down over Kentucky and West Virginia, over rivers and routes and railroads. It has been three years since I was last in this pocket of Tennessee, stopping off then for a few days between Nashville and Clarksdale. But I remember it well, this sprawling city on the fourth Chickasaw Bluff, the way the bustling main streets blurred so quickly to mimsy borogoves, the juke joints, the heavy rain, the way the warm air rubbed up against your legs. </p> <p>We ran all over town, my best friend and I: to the Stax Museum, to Sun Studios, to a Jimbo Mathus gig, to the Lamplighter with its magnificent landlady and its marvellous jukebox, to a little middle-of-nowhere-no-name bar where we thought we might get killed, but where we were disappointed to find only a guy with a mullet singing well-polished country songs. </p> <p>We went to the famous Beale Street, of course, which you could walk down wearing your pyjamas, according to Chuck Berry, but which is today a bit of a tourist drag, all neon and nostalgia and nick-nacks. We drove out to Graceland, and to Graceland Too, a pink-painted shrine to the King sitting out in Holly Springs. And one night we went to see BB King. The crowd spilled out the door and on to the street, and I had to stand on tiptoes and squint just to see King's hands sitting way up there on the 10th fret, second string, bending notes. </p> <p>But the room was so crowded mostly all I could see was the broad back of the man in front of me, green shirt sticking to the strip of skin between his shoulder blades, and the sound of King's playing was drowned by the noise of the street running through the open door. And in that hot, airless room I strained to see, and I strained to hear, and I strained to think what any of us there that night had ever hoped to find in Memphis. </p> <p>Memphis is a city tethered not only to Presley and King, but also to Howlin' Wolf and Jerry Lee Lewis, to WC Handy, Johnny Cash and Booker T Jones and many more besides. And it's this that summons people, blues buffs, soul devotees, as if they arrive hoping that the air itself here - humid, subtropical, moist with the Gulf of Mexico, floating down Beale Street heavy with mosquitos - might somehow explain the music they love. </p> <p>It made me feel strange to see them sniffing the air and chasing ghosts all over town; standing in the Stax museum staring at Otis Redding's favourite brown suede jacket, shuffling round Graceland with a lanyard and an audio guide, waiting for a whiff of magic. But the only thing the air seemed to give up was the scent of dead men's clothes.</p> <p>One morning we went on a tour of the Gibson Guitar factory, 10 bucks, 45 minutes: a guide to the processes of binding, neck-fitting, painting, buffing, fine-tuning that make a Gibson guitar. I remember watching the luthiers, working carefully, soberly, and the smell of carved wood and the high, thin fumes of the varnish rising up to the ceiling. The part I liked most was the sight of the guitars drying on the binding tree; wrapped in long pale strips of material, they looked like giant pupae, and inside a Gibson waiting to unfurl.</p> <p>My favourite song about this city is Tom T Hall's That's How I Got to Memphis - a song covered so exquisitely by Solomon Burke a couple of years back. \"If you love somebody enough you'll follow them wherever they go,\" it runs. It's a song about love of course, and devotion, but it casts Memphis not only as the place where his true love has fled, but as a city of hope, a place where that love can be resurrected. And it was this that I felt standing there in the Gibson factory - that people come to this weird, muggy corner of Tennessee not just because of their devotion to BB King or Elvis Presley or Carl Perkins, but because of all the hope they place in music, and because, as Solomon sang: \"I've got to find her and tell her that I love her so.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Where do you get your ideas from?\" Every author who gives talks to children or adults has been asked this question hundreds of times, and of course there's no simple answer. Ideas are everywhere - the trick is to recognise a promising one when you get it, and not let go. Your starting point may be something that's happened to you, or to someone you know; a news item; a fear, or a dream; something from the past; a fascinating character; a painting or poem; and of course our heads are crammed full of ideas and images from books we've read, stories we've heard and films we've seen. Several of my own books have begun with a particular place or atmosphere: an intriguing old house (Nevermore), a wartime airfield (Flightsend), an out-of-season seaside resort (The Sandfather).</p> <p>When a promising idea grabs hold of you, hang on to it and see if you can turn it into a story, or at least the beginning of a story. You can build on it by asking yourself questions and thinking of the answers. Who? When? Why? will get you started; then more and more questions will follow: But why doesn't he tell anyone? Who could possibly help her? Where have his parents gone? What's he hiding from? At this stage, it's a game: you haven't committed yourself to anything, and can enjoy playing around with ideas and possibilities. When you're ready, you can start making notes on the characters and their situations.</p> <p>Every story, whatever the genre, must involve conflict, and it's useful (though not necessarily at this early stage) to be able to convey the essence of your story in a single phrase. As the agent Carole Blake, author of From Pitch to Publication, puts it, any story can be boiled down to: What does the main character want, and what's stopping them from getting it? If there's no conflict, there's no story. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Macbeth: What does Macbeth want? To be King of Scotland. What's stopping him? There's already a king, with two sons as his heirs. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Far From the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy: What does Gabriel Oak want? To marry Bathsheba Everdene. What's stopping him? She becomes a woman of property, and falls in love with the wrong man.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tom's Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce: What does Tom want? To explore outside, instead of spending the summer holidays cooped up in his aunt and uncle's flat. What's stopping him? He's in quarantine for measles, and expected to stay indoors.</p> <p>A story is driven by the facing and resolution of the central conflict. Too early a resolution means that all tension is lost. Too easy or convenient a solution means that the story won't convince. Let's look in detail at a 32-page picture book, Dogger by Shirley Hughes. What does Dave want? To be reunited with his favourite toy, Dogger. What's stopping him? ...</p> <p>In the opening pages, we're shown how important the toy dog is to Dave. His sister Bella sleeps with several bears tucked up next to her; Dave has Dogger with him in bed. No other toy will do. The first crisis comes when Dogger is dropped in the street while Mum and the children buy and eat ice-cream cornets. At bedtime, when Dave can't find Dogger, the whole family is involved in searching; but the toy can't be found.</p> <p>Next day, at the school fete, Dave is unhappy, missing Dogger. Meanwhile, Bella's enjoying herself, coming first in a race, winning a raffle prize. Dave is jealous, because his sister's having such a good day while he's miserable. Then he sees Dogger, sitting on the back of the toy stall, with a price-tag. Dave hasn't got enough money, so he runs to find Bella. Now the second crisis: as they hurry back to the stall, a little girl has bought Dogger and is walking away with him. </p> <p>The resolution doesn't come immediately; we have to see the possibility of Dave being parted with his toy forever. Bella offers to buy Dogger back, but the girl refuses - she's paid, and now he's hers. Dave is distraught, crying as the girl marches off with Dogger. The answer doesn't arrive out of the blue, either - it's already been built into the story and is there in the pictures. Bella is clutching a big teddy-bear, her raffle prize. Although we know that Bella likes bears, she offers to swap the teddy for her brother's toy; the girl agrees, preferring the brand-new bear to battered old Dogger, and everyone's happy. The final picture shows Bella in bed with her row of bears, and Dave tucked up with Dogger. The story is expertly paced and dramatised, and we've seen the swings of resentment and affection between brother and sister. Needless to say, Shirley Hughes' illustrations give character, warmth and charm to a story crafted from the stuff of ordinary family life.</p> <p>Try applying this simple what does he/she want formula to novels you've read recently, or to films, and then to the story you're thinking of writing. The dilemma set up, and its resolution, give you the main thrust of the story. In a picture book like Dogger, one plot strand is enough; in a novel for juniors or older, more will be going on. If, for example, your central character is a keen footballer desperate to be picked for the local team, there can be scenes at home and at school, perhaps involving a division of loyalty or clash of responsibility, so that the football detail isn't overwhelming.</p> <p>Sometimes writers, especially inexperienced ones, come to a halt simply because they've lost sight of where the story is going. Authors vary tremendously in the amount of planning they do - some like to know exactly how the story will unfold, and have a chapter-by-chapter plan; others prefer to gather their ingredients, then let the story develop, leaving room for surprises. There's no right or wrong way, of course, but when you embark on a story for the first time you're more likely to feel confident if you can always see where to go next. This route can be plotted via stepping stones (see panel above) - you don't need to plan every detail, but at least you know what the next major episode will be.</p> <p>Julia Jarman, author of Hangman and Peace Weavers, says that writing a novel is like making a film, \"but you're taking charge of every aspect of it. The casting, costumes, locations, dialogue, special effects, pacing - everything, and you do it all with words.\" If you think of your unfolding novel as a film being privately screened inside your head, it will help you to establish the setting with enough but not too much description, like the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of film, and to vary the pace of the narrative. For instance, a scene that consists mainly of people talking can be followed by one that develops the plot through action or a shift in location, or moves more quickly through time. Some writers plan through storyboards, another way of thinking in filmic or dramatic terms.</p> <h2>Nicola Davies on how to write non-fiction for children</h2> <p>Writing non-fiction won't get you onto any literary high tables, but it is still a noble calling: your words could instill lifelong curiosity in your readers. Start with thorough research; don't skimp because it's \"only for kids\" - it'll make your writing superficial.</p> <p>Once you have assembled everything, be prepared to cut. Don't worry that you aren't telling your readers everything. It's better to tell them one thing they'll remember than ten things they'll forget. The most basic information can be interesting for young children; how a foot makes a print in sand is more exciting to a two year old than the geology of the beach. And don't be scared to say what is not known - it's important that children see knowledge as an ongoing project that they could contribute to.</p> <p>Lists don't make readable books, so find a narrative thread to string your information on. One way to do this is to describe what your book is about in one word. I found my book about blue whales was about \"bigness\", but my turtle one was actually about \"memory\".</p> <p>Make sure you use the right language for your audience. Translating complex information into words that children can understand takes time and lots of thinking. Use examples from the child's world to help. Always remember that the only way writing non-fiction differs from fiction is that you don't have to make up anything up. Keep your writing rich and interesting.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nicola Davies' latest non-fiction book is What's Eating You?</p> <h2>Exercise: stepping stones</h2> <p>Using numbered points, make a simple outline of a story you know well - Cinderella, for example - showing the main plot events.</p> <p>Now do the same for a story or your own, using stepping stones to show the unfolding of conflict and how it will be resolved.</p>",
  "<p>The main characters in fiction for children and teenagers tend, not surprisingly, to be children and teenagers, though it's not hard to find exceptions, such as Philip Pullman's Once Upon a Time in the North. To write convincingly, whether in first- or third-person, you need to position yourself inside the head of one or more characters. In Tom's Midnight Garden, we share Tom's thoughts all the way: his frustration at being cooped up, his interest in the old grandfather clock, his surprise at finding that the midnight garden is different from the daytime one. </p> <p>One way of getting a sense of your characters as rounded human beings, rather than as cardboard cut-outs, is to build them through questions and answers. For example: What's in her pocket? Who does she dislike, and why? What's her best subject at school? Who would she most like to get a text message from? What's she most anxious about? and so on. And it's important to hear your character speaking, and to see his or her body language.</p> <p>Adults will almost inevitably appear, but children's writers are adept at getting rid of them, or at least keeping them on the sidelines, so that the children have to confront their own difficulties. Health and safety consciousness can curtail the activities of children in present-day stories of the real world, which may account for the huge amount of fantasy published in recent years; in imaginary settings, child characters can be magicians, warriors, seers, time-travellers, or whatever the author wants them to be. Similarly, children in historical fiction can plausibly face huge responsibilities and go on dangerous journeys with only their own resources to depend on. </p> <p>What's crucial is that the child characters are central to the action, and play a decisive part - they can't just have things happen to them. In Dogger, it's the children who sort out the problem - the outcome would be less satisfying if Dave's parents had swooped in to take charge.</p> <p>In some settings, children - and adults - seem powerless. Continuing the tradition of stories about children caught up in war, oppression and persecution, the author Elizabeth Laird has written, with great success, novels featuring street children in Addis Ababa (The Garbage King), a Kurdish refugee (Red Sky in the Morning) and a Palestinian boy living in the Occupied Territories (A Little Patch of Ground). Importantly, Laird makes her child characters more than passive victims of persecution. Karim and his friends convert a patch of wasteland into a football pitch, defiantly raising a Palestinian flag; their game of football is unlikely to challenge Israeli dominance, yet the novel humanises the situation and engages the reader by showing us one boy's very ordinary aspiration. </p> <p>Most important of all is that your readers must care about your character. Endow your hero or heroine with skill, beauty and undentable self-confidence and you risk alienating the reader. Flaws, self-doubts and weaknesses - in even the most spirited of characters, like Philip Pullman's Lyra - engage reader sympathy. Winnie-the-Pooh is endearing because he's well-meaning, but easily confused; Jane Eyre because she considers herself to be plain and unremarkable. Christopher in The Curious Incident ... is aware that his Asperger's syndrome marks him out as different, but makes us see people and events with his own logic and dogged determination.</p> <p>A problem frequently seen in students' writing is viewpoint-hopping. Without realising, they've changed the point of view from paragraph to paragraph, or even from sentence to sentence, so reading the story feels like jumping in and out of various characters' heads. This is unsettling for the reader, and rarely works.</p> <p>Of course you can use more than one viewpoint: children's fiction, like any other fiction, can have omniscient narrators, multiple narrators, unreliable narrators. There aren't any rules, but you should know what rules you've made for yourself, know when you're breaking them, and do so for good reason. </p> <h2>Michael Lawrence on what makes kids laugh</h2> <p>Adults who haven't read any of my books about Jiggy McCue and his pals might imagine that they are relentlessly rude crowd-pleasers. With titles like The Killer Underpants, The Toilet of Doom and Nudie Dudie I can hardly blame them, but in fact I avoid extreme vulgarity, and scatological humour in particular. Kids love a little gentle rudeness, though, and this I do supply, because it appeals to me too. A good example is 'The Fellowship of Ancient Rights for Trees' in The Snottle. Jiggy refers to the organisation's members as 'FARTers', always emphasising the first syllable to irritate his mother. Well, isn't that what you would have done when you were 11 or 12?</p> <p>I don't go out of my way to keep up with the times in these stories. Mobile phones, DVDs, famous film stars and so on are mentioned, but Jiggy's school experiences are essentially my own from over half a century ago. I base his lessons on the lessons that I remember so well. (Some of his teachers were my actual teachers - and yes, I use their real names). You might think that this would date the books, but children can't have changed much, as they write to me in droves to say how much like Jiggy's world theirs is. I find that rather pleasing.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael Lawrence latest book is Jiggy McCue: Kid Swap (Orchard)</p> <h2>Lauren Child on how to illustrate a story</h2> <p>There are millions of talented illustrators out there who would love to illustrate books for children. They are creative, they are original, they are skilful. And yet they have to suffer one rejection after the other.</p> <p>I know, because for the first five years of my career, I was one of them. It was only when I realised that I could write my own books that I got my first manuscript accepted.</p> <p>Normally, as an illustrator, you are taught to treat text with a lot of respect, reverence even. The books that you illustrate tend to arrive paginated, with the text already fine-tuned. But in a good picture-book, the pictures should be as important - if not more important - than the text. I never finish the text before I am done with the illustrations.</p> <p>When you illustrate a story, don't try to show what the words are already telling you. You have to add something new. I try to do this by changing perspective, or by engaging with my characters' imagination. In one of my books, Charlie tells Lola that she has to go to bed \"because all the birds have gone to bed\". To which Lola replies: \"But I'm not a bird\". Rather than showing Lola in the kitchen, where the conversation is taking place, I showed Lola sitting in a bird's nest.</p> <p>The simplest drawings of characters are the often the most successful: think of Miffy or Peanuts. But even the simplest human face has to show more than one expression over the course of your book. If you want your character to be liked, you have to give them an emotional inner life.</p> <p>I always know when I see a good illustration: I get jealous. The tricky thing is that you have to actively resist the temptation to imitate the illustrators you like. Many publishers will pretend that they want your book to look \"more like Quentin Blake\" or \"a bit like Shirley Hughes\". But deep down they want to see something new.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lauren Child's collected Clarice Bean stories are published by Orchard</p>",
  "<p>A British artist walked free yesterday after being cleared of insulting Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, by portraying him as a dog in a case seen as a test of Turkey's tolerance of free speech.</p> <p>A Turkish court acquitted Michael Dickinson of criminal charges despite citing \"some insulting elements\" in his depiction of Erdogan as a dog attached to a leash in the colours of the US flag. But the court ruled that the artwork was \"within the limits of criticism\".</p> <p>Dickinson, 58, who has lived in Turkey for 20 years, was charged with \"insulting the prime minister's dignity\" in September and could have faced up to two years in jail if convicted. He was arrested after unfurling the picture at a court hearing of an art exhibition organiser, who had been charged with insulting behaviour for displaying another of Dickinson's works. The earlier picture depicted Erdogan as a dog being presented with a rosette by George Bush. His acquittal may ease some pressure on Turkey from the EU, which called on Ankara to improve its record on human rights and freedom of speech issues as a condition of entry.</p> <p>Dickinson, a member of the Stuckist art movement, voiced relief at his acquittal but warned that other artists still faced legal pressure for expressing dissenting views. \"I am lucky to be acquitted. There are still artists in Turkey facing prosecution and being sentenced for their opinions,\" he told AP.</p> <p>The verdict ended a saga which has included four court hearings and seen Dickinson's fellow Stuckists calling first on Tony Blair and then Gordon Brown to intervene.</p> <p>Charges were pressed against Dickinson after he displayed his poster of Erdogan on a leash, which he called Good Boy, at the trial of Erkan Kara, organiser of an exhibition staged by the Global Peace and Justice Coalition, a campaign opposed to the US-led occupation of Iraq. Kara had been prosecuted after the exhibition showed Dickinson's earlier poster.</p> <p>Dickinson was forced to leave Turkey after his residence permit was cancelled but was charged when he returned on a tourist visa. After his arrest he spent 10 days in police detention during which an attempted escape was foiled when a pursuing police officer fired a gun at him.</p> <p>Dickinson, who was born in Durham, is not the first artist to have been prosecuted for allegedly insulting Erdogan. In 2005 the prime minister successfully sued a cartoonist who portrayed him as a cat tangled up in a ball of wool. Dickinson had earlier gained notoriety when his website was blanked by the host server for displaying a poster which showed Bush with a swastika on his right buttock and a cruise missile coming out of his rear.</p>",
  "<p>Hip-hop star Busta Rhymes was denied entry to the UK on his way to a charity concert yesterday because of his criminal convictions in the US. </p> <p>Rhymes was held at London City airport for 11 hours. Last night a high court judge ordered the rapper's immediate release, ruling that it was arguable that his detention was unlawful. </p> <p>He was given bail to stay overnight at his hotel before a further hearing today to determine whether he can play at the Orange RockCorps gig at the Royal Albert Hall - a free concert for 5,000 charity volunteers which he is headlining.</p> <p>A judicial review of the decision to prevent the rapper from performing is scheduled for 2pm today, raising the prospect of a frantic few hours of legal wrangling before the 7pm start of the gig.</p> <p>Speaking last night from his central London hotel, Rhymes said he was \"energetic\" despite the day's tribulations. \"I believe in giving back to one's community and I think it's important to spread that message. I'm here officially in the UK and I'll be able to put on an incredible show for the kids tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Earlier Mr Justice Flaux heard that Rhymes, whose real name is Trevor Smith Jr, had been kept in a small room with five armed police officers after being stopped by immigration officials when he arrived at the airport at 7.26am. The UK authorities wanted to fly him back to Amsterdam two hours later, citing \"unresolved convictions\" in America, but at 8.58am his legal team secured an injunction preventing him from getting on the flight.</p> <p>The judge said: \"In all the circumstances it seems to me that he is entitled to an order that he be released forthwith or alternatively is entitled to bail.\"</p> <p>Smith's lawyer, Philip Trott, said the star was \"very happy\" with the outcome of the 11th-hour hearing last night.</p> <p>In March, Smith, 36, was given three years' probation in New York for assaulting his former driver and a fan who had allegedly spat on his car, in separate incidents. He was also ordered to do 10 days' community service, pay a $1,250 (\u00a3675) fine plus costs and enrol in an anti-drink-driving programme.</p> <p>The judge at Manhattan criminal court warned Smith, whose hits include Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See, Dangerous and Touch It: \"If you mess up, you're going to jail. I've given you a chance.\"</p> <p>In the wake of Smith's detention, Orange RockCorps said Ludacris, a fellow American hip-hop star and friend of Rhymes, had been added to the bill to perform alongside the Automatic, Guillemots, Lethal Bizzle, John Legend and Feeder in front of concert-goers who had earned their tickets by volunteering for four hours at community charity projects over the summer.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said Smith had been told he did not have permission to work in the UK due to what she described as his \"minor\" criminal record.

  "<p>Some of the UK's biggest supermarkets and food companies could be fined tens of millions of pounds after a consumer watchdog said there was evidence they had been sharing information on prices.</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has written to more than 20 companies, including J Sainsbury, Tesco, Coca-Cola, Mars and Procter &amp; Gamble, to say there are \"reasonable grounds to suspect\" data about pricing levels was passed to rival supermarkets through suppliers.</p> <p>A spokesman confirmed the letter had been sent, adding: \"The OFT is conducting an investigation into potential breaches of competition law by a number of retailers and suppliers, across a range of product areas. In the interests of transparency, the OFT has written to all parties, providing an update on the investigation.\"</p> <p>However, the watchdog said it was \"inappropriate to give any further detail at this stage\" and one supermarket executive who had seen the letter dismissed it as \"standard issue\".</p> <p>None of the companies has been accused of breaking the law but, if it is eventually concluded that a cartel has been operating, the companies involved could be fined up to 10% of annual turnover. </p> <p>It is the biggest cartel inquiry undertaken by the OFT and was prompted by Asda, which uncovered information when going through internal email records last summer. The supermarket's examination of its email trail was ordered by the Competition Commission, which was seeking evidence of suppliers being badly treated by grocers as part of its investigation into the grocery sector.</p> <p>In the wake of Asda's alert, the OFT raided Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Procter &amp; Gamble. P&amp;G, whose brands include Duracell, Gillette and Pampers , is the world's biggest consumer goods firm. At the time of the raids, in April, P&amp;G said it was company policy \"to fully abide by the letter and spirit of the law\".</p> <p>The supermarkets also said they would cooperate fully. </p> <p>The watchdog demanded information from other companies, including Reckitt Benckiser, GlaxoSmithKline, Nestl\u00e9, Mars, Coca-Cola, Unilever and Cadbury. Unilever's product portfolio includes Dove soap, Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and Domestos. Reckitt Benckiser counts Cillit Bang, Dettol and Clearasil among its brands.</p> <p>It is understood the inquiry is focused on whether the information-sharing broke the same laws that led to sportswear suppliers and retailers being hit with multimillion-pound fines over the pricing of replica football kits. That inquiry was also prompted by an internal whistleblower: Sports Direct billionaire and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley.</p> <p>The inquiry into supermarkets and their suppliers covers a range of products, such as pasta sauce, toothpaste, tea and moisturising cream.</p> <p>The OFT's raids sparked an angry reaction from the supermarket industry, which said it was being unfairly targeted by watchdogs. One senior food retailer accused the regulator of embarking on a \"fishing expedition\" as it had asked for such a wide range of information.</p> <p>The raids came a day after the OFT had apologised, and paid \u00a3100,000 plus costs, to Morrisons to settle a defamation suit. The regulator admitted it had been wrong to accuse the company of fixing the price of butter and cheese.</p> <p>However, several grocers and dairy suppliers, including Sainsbury's, Arla, Dairy Crest and Robert Wiseman, have paid some \u00a3120m in fines after admitting involvement in milk market price fixing.</p> <p>Another OFT inquiry, into collaboration between supermarkets and tobacco firms on cigarette prices, is still ongoing.</p>",
  "<p>Hot and sweaty tube journeys are to become a memory for millions of commuters after London mayor Boris Johnson unveiled the first air-conditioned London Underground trains.</p> <p>But millions more will still be consigned to cattle-truck conditions underground, where temperatures regularly top 30c in the summer, because most of the network is too small for the new trains. Instead, tube managers are searching out hidden water sources under London's streets, including long-forgotten rivers, that can be used to cool the deepest-lying stations.</p> <p>Unveiling a prototype of the trains, which will cost \u00a38.5m each, Johnson said yesterday it was time the capital caught up with the rest of the world: \"They have got air-conditioned trains in New York, they have got them in Los Angeles, so we have got to have it here.\" The new carriages will be introduced from 2010 on the Hammersmith &amp; City, Metropolitan, District and Circle lines. By the time the deployment is finished in 2015, there will be 191 new trains on the network.</p> <p>Johnson admitted passengers on the seven deep lines - including the busy Northern, Central, Victoria and Piccadilly routes - will have to put up with uncomfortable summers for some time yet. While there is room for bulky trains carrying roof-mounted air-conditioning units on the District and Circle line tunnels, it is impossible to fit them into the much smaller deep tunnels. There is also no outlet in those tunnels for hot air pumped out of the carriages.</p> <p>Johnson told passengers on the deep lines not to give up hope: \"We are working flat out to find a solution and we have not abandoned the idea at all. The advent of these new trains will put even more pressure on us to produce an equivalent experience on the deep lines. If you can put a man on the moon there is no reason why we cannot put air conditioning on the Northern line.\" </p> <p>The new trains, which have nearly 20% more space then their predecessors, will cover 40% of the network, which carries more than 3 million passengers a day.</p> <p>In the meantime, London Underground is scouring geological maps to find untapped water sources that can be used to cool the hottest stations. It is using water from the river Tyburn to drive cool air through Victoria station. It is also looking at putting blocks of ice underneath train seats that will release chilled air into carriages and is considering putting more industrial fans inside stations after installing 40 of them this summer.</p> <p>Johnson also warned the government that the trains unveiled yesterday would not be able to reduce overcrowding unless they were accompanied by a multibillion-pound overhaul of tracks and signals. A funding row between London Underground and the companies charged with doing the work is threatening the upgrades. Johnson said the government should step in because it imposed the troubled Public Private Partnership programme that is supposed to do the work. </p> <p>\"The government is morally responsible for the design of the PPP, which it imposed on London and which has done absolutely nothing to protect the taxpayer or indeed the farepayer,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>David Millar was a frustrated and bemused man yesterday after finishing ninth in the world time-trial championship only 33 seconds outside the medals, but the Scot accepted that he might be paying the price for an exceptionally long season of racing, which began in January and included the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France.</p> <p>Millar was merely one of the crowd yesterday, one of 11 riders closely grouped around fourth place, whereas the winner, Bert Grabsch of Germany, was in a class of his own, 42sec ahead of the silver medallist, Svein Tuft of Canada. Grabsch is Germany's first men's world time-trial champion since Jan Ullrich in 2001. \"This is always an unpredictable event; you tend to get an eclectic top 10,\" said Millar.</p> <p>Tuft was little known outside north America until he finished seventh in the time-trial in Beijing last month. He came to cycling largely because one day he decided to go cycle-touring with his dog in a hand-built caravan. These were not easy jaunts but a series of 1,000km epics between Mexico and Alaska, sleeping out at night in sub-zero temperatures and living on what he could earn along the way. Not surprisingly, he yesterday had the look of a man who could not quite believe where he was, whereas Millar was turning his mind to Sunday's elite road race.</p> <p>Today, however, Britain field probably their strongest team in the Under-23 event since its inception in 1996, with three of the five-man squad - Jonny Bellis, Peter Kennaugh and Ben Swift - in with a chance of equalling or improving on Bellis's bronze medal in Stuttgart last year.</p> <p>All five are part of the road-racing academy, based in Tuscany, and part of British Cycling's young talent development system which contributed to the Beijing medal haul. Kennaugh is only 19 but is showing the same precocious talent as his fellow Manxman Mark Cavendish, with two wins in major Under-23 events in Italy this season, and Bellis and Swift have performed strongly enough to win professional contracts for next year.</p>",

  "<p>Amid the sound and fury and frightening price tag surrounding the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/25/wallstreet.useconomy\">proposed Wall Street bailout</a>, US government rescuers can take a simple step that would fight runaway corporate greed at the root of the crisis. This single reform would rein in excesses including obscene executive salaries and unreasonable risk to forestall future crises. </p> <p>Best of all, this reform won't need a cent of taxpayer money, and once enacted will reduce government regulation. The reform relies on a mechanism familiar to most members of the US Congress, at least in theory: grassroots democracy.</p> <p>One of the most effective and cheapest ways to regulate corporations is to let the owners to do it themselves. In the US, shareholders are supposed supervise the companies they own through elected boards of directors, but corporate trickery endorsed under the current rules puts management, not investors, in control of corporate boards. Clearing out these roadblocks to democracy will empower shareholders to supervise the companies they own. And owners won't stand for their money being squandered on $6,000 shower curtains or $46m golden parachutes. </p> <p>Anyone with enough money can buy a stock. But as John McCain's economic adviser <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/16/fiorina_palin_lacks_experience.html\">Carly Fiorina noted last week</a>, not everyone can run a major corporation. (Her work at Lucent and Hewlett Packard makes Fiorina an expert on the subject.) So owners hire specialists \u2013 executives \u2013 to operate the business for them. The system gives executives control of assets that don't belong to them. </p> <p>To address this situation, known in management science as the agency problem, US shareholders elect boards of directors to supervise company managers. Directors are legally bound to protect shareholder interests. They leave day-to-day operations to executives but provide broad oversight - approving strategic goals and directions, deciding ownership issues including mergers and acquisitions, hiring and firing the chief executive officer and setting executive compensation.</p> <p>Annual board elections are supposed to ensure that directors continue to represent shareholder interests. Shareholders receive a ballot, known as a proxy card, to vote for directors. Investors send back their proxy card (or, in most cases, don't), the votes are counted and elected directors ensure that managers take good care of the shareholders' property. </p> <p>That's how it's supposed to work. In practice, the inmates are running the asylum. Management, not shareholders, controls director elections and has turned boards of directors from watchdogs for investors into lapdogs for executive whims. Management seized power with the help of arcane and antiquated rules to establish a <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115828645964263952.html?mod=todays_us_opinion\">Soviet-style election system</a> that perpetuates its grip. </p> <p>Under present rules, company executives, not shareholders, determine the nominees whose names appear on the company election ballot. Executives offer one nominee per slot, so nomination is tantamount to election. That makes directors beholden to the entrenched executives nominating them, not the shareholders ratifying them. </p> <p>To ensure management's nominees always win, only its choices appear on the company ballot sent to shareholders at company expense. If shareholders want to have a choice in the election, they have to send out their own ballot, at their own expense, a costly process that companies can load with hazards and hindrances, including expending shareholder money from the corporate treasury to mount lawsuits. Since director elections rarely present real choice, dissidents that clear the initial hurdles must spend thousands more to let shareholders know they are contesting the election. Such challenges rarely succeed.</p> <p>Directors effectively selected by management and owing their positions to management protect and respond to management, not shareholders. They rubber stamp massive executives pay packages and don't vigorously challenge strategic decisions. Having company CEOs routinely serving directors, often chairing the board, where their primary mission is to supervise themselves, vividly illustrates that most boards are performing a parody of their intended function. Lack of ownership oversight as well as government regulation enabled the corporate excesses and errors at the root of the present financial crisis. </p> <p>\"We've always said that excessively high levels of CEO compensation is a symptom of failed corporate governance that would come back to haunt us,\" said Rich Ferlauto, director of pension investment policy for the <a href=\"http://www.afscme.org/\">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees</a>. \"And we were right.\"</p> <p>Congress can end this madness by enabling free and fair elections that let investors freely choose boards of directors that really represent them. The easy fix is to open the corporate ballot to shareholder nominees on equal terms with management's. That would give shareholders a meaningful role in choosing who supervises their investments. It would make directors accountable to shareholders, either spurring them to fulfil their obligation to protect investor interests or facilitating their replacement with directors that will. </p> <p>This simple reform is <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/mar2008/ca20080313_866458.htm?chan=careers_managing+your+board+page_corporate+governance\">\"the holy grail\" of corporate governance reform</a>, according to AFSCME's Ferlauto. In 2003, after compliant corporate boards enabled the Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and other debacles, the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) proposed opening the company ballot to one or two large shareholder nominees. Investors would get a choice between candidates on a single ballot, and at least some directors would need votes from shareholders and be motivated to protect investor interests. </p> <p>That nod toward free and fair elections didn't satisfy investor rights advocates, but it scared the hell out of corporate executives. They realised that losing absolute control of the board would make them accountable to shareholders. They mounted a desperate public and private effort to defeat the measure. Their most ludicrous argument was that contested elections would open board membership to \"special interests\". Calling the owners of the company \"special interests\" underscores executives' conviction that companies belong to them, not shareholders. It also demonstrates fear that most management nominees couldn't win a fair vote. <br> Even though the proposal generated the largest volume of public comment, nearly all of it favourable, in SEC history, corporate lobbyists (paid with shareholders' money) managed to kill the measure. But AFSCME, whose members have billions in pension funds invested in the stock market, didn't give up. The government workers' union filed resolutions for votes at companies where they believed poor director oversight was putting investors' equity at risk, including current crisis stars AIG and Bear Stearns. </p> <p>AFSCME's efforts prompted a court decision that <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/29/business/fi-shareholders29\">forced the SEC to vote last November</a>. The commission's three Republican members outvoted the single Democrat (one Democratic seat was vacant) to bar shareholder access to the ballot. AFSCME <a href=\"http://www.afscme.org/press/17494.cfm\">refiled its proposal</a> this year at Bear Stearns, and when the SEC staff allowed Bear to knock it off the ballot, the union sued. \"We were on the way to court that Monday when Bear Stearns went under,\" Ferlauto recalled.</p> <p>Now the union is pursuing the reform in Congress, and Wall Street's crisis presents an opportunity to speed the process. According to Ferlauto, the first draft of the rescue bill from the House financial services committee chaired by Democrat Barney Frank would require companies receiving bailout funds to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2150844420080921\">limit executive pay</a> and open the company ballot to directors nominated by shareholders representing 3% of the company. </p> <p>\"This is the foot in the door,\" Ferlauto said. He envisions Congress including opening the company ballot for all corporations as part of a broader regulatory reform package early next year. </p> <p>Executives certainly won't give up their ludicrous pay packets and excessive power without a fight. As happened with the Enron-era scandals, corporations and their lobbyists will lay low until the furore subsides, then do their best to scuttle reform. They'll say it's socialist and un-American to give shareholders real power to supervise the companies they own. </p> <p>But investor oversight is a cornerstone of American shareholder capitalism the way it's supposed to operate. This crisis presents Congress with an opportunity to make corporate America an offer it can't refuse.</p>",
  "<p>ID cards for foreign nationals are the thin end of the wedge, whatever they look like \u2013 and the home secretary, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/25/idcards.immigrationpolicy\">unveiled their design today</a>, knows it. Here's how it goes:</p> <p>Step 1: Target a weak group who have no political voice in the UK and who benefit from little public backing or support, and make them the guinea pig for a deeply unpopular policy. </p> <p>Step 2: Once the sacrifice of their rights has embedded as \"standard procedure\", pick off the next target \u2013 airport workers perhaps \u2013 or a group similarly small and likely to fly under the public radar. </p> <p>Step 3: Involve other public service workers in \"sensitive\" positions, followed next by students, and so it will go until we have all had our privacy surrendered to Labour's surveillance state. </p> <p>This strategy rests on a highly cynical assessment of the British people. At best it hopes we won't notice when others are having their civil liberties brazenly suspended. At worst it assumes that our fear of outsiders will allow us to sit idly by as innocent people are forced to hand over personal details to a government database. </p> <p>Bear in mind that these are people already living legally in the UK, with the papers to prove it, who have moved here from outside of the European Union to study or to be with the person they love. </p> <p>If the aim of this scheme was genuinely to combat illegal immigration and working, as ministers profess, there are more sensible solutions. Better exit checks and stricter controls on unscrupulous employers would be far more effective. </p> <p>The government keeps saying <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/idcards\">ID cards</a> will make us safer. But I doubt that terrorists will be trembling at the prospect of the new cards \u2013 they're mandatory in Madrid yet failed to prevent the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/madridtrainbombs\">tragic train bombings</a> in 2004. The key obstacle in catching terror suspects is rarely naming them, but is more about monitoring them and building up a case for prosecution. </p> <p>Issuing these ID cards \u2013 no matter how fancy \u2013 is an expensive distraction. That's why the millions to be wasted on this scheme are better spent putting 10,000 more police on the beat. </p> <p>It is shameful for ministers to exploit powerless groups to impose the new cards by stealth, and to stoke public fear by tainting foreigners with suspicion. It is patronising that they think we will not speak up for our privacy, and the privacy of others. The liberal commitment to freedom is universal, it shouldn't be determined by the colour of your skin. </p> <p>It is still not too late for Gordon Brown to cancel the most powerful, most expensive and most intrusive database in the world. He should know that an increasing number of people will not accept their details being handed over to a government that has repeatedly shown itself incapable of keeping personal data safe. Labour's boneheaded refusal to heed public opinion is exactly why this government is hitting the rocks.

  "<p>Considering they're the most enduring features of many people's lives and have probably kept a writer or two out of the asylum, platonic relationships get low billing in cinema - maybe because they lack the dramatic TNT of sexual passion, and the kind of slow-burn cinema needed to realistically portray a long friendship is now about as fashionable as catapult warfare. Still, lumpen-faced actors can rest safe in the knowledge that there will always be a casting call for the utilitarian friend in the following glamorous capacities: (a) sidekick - the kind that makes the hero look even better, preferably with hints of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44rPOwCODww&amp;feature=related\">moral weakness</a> to be developed later (b) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r58_6u0xLrc\">safe port of call </a>- so globe-trotting alpha protagonists can visit exotic locations and patronise any ethnic acquaintances with whom they \"go back a long way\" (c) exposition (1min 40secs) - the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiEhE-51ibY&amp;feature=related\">screenwriter's best friend</a>.</p> <p>For those who don't know the Clip joint drill, we'd love it if you posted your own suggestions - preferably with a video link - in the comments section below.

  "<p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, today unveiled the first identity cards to be issued as part of the government's controversial national scheme.</p> <p>The biometric card will be issued from November, initially to non-EU students and marriage visa holders.</p> <p>The credit-card-sized document will show the holder's photograph, name, date of birth, nationality and immigration status. </p> <p>A secure electronic chip will also hold their biometric details, including fingerprints and a digital facial image.</p> <p>Smith said that the cards would allow people to \"easily and securely prove their identity\".</p> <p>\"We want to be able to prevent those here illegally from benefiting from the privileges of Britain,\" she said. </p> <p>Compulsory identity cards for foreign nationals will kick-start the national identity scheme, with the first applicants having to apply for cards from November 25.</p> <p>Within three years all foreign nationals applying for leave to enter or remain in the UK will be required to have a card, with around nine in ten foreign nationals in Britain covered by the scheme by 2014-15, Smith said.</p> <p>The UK Border Agency will begin issuing the biometric cards to the two categories of foreign nationals who officials say are most at risk of abusing immigration rules - students and those on a marriage or civil partnership visa.</p> <p>Both types of migrants will be told they must have the new card when they ask to extend their stay in the country. </p> <p>The home secretary said that employers and colleges wanted to be confident people were who they said they were, while immigration and police officers wanted to verify identity and detect abuse.</p> <p>\"We all want to see our borders more secure, and human trafficking, organised immigration crime, illegal working and benefit fraud tackled. ID cards for foreign nationals, in locking people to one identity, will deliver in all these areas,\" the home secretary said.</p> <p>The Conservatives say they support modern biometric cards for immigrants - but they say a national identity register remains unworkable.</p> <p>Phil Booth, head of the national No2ID campaign group, attacked the roll-out of the cards as a \"softening-up exercise\".</p> <p>\"The Home Office is trying to salami-slice the population to get this scheme going in any way they can,\" he told the BBC.</p> <p>\"Once they get some people to take the card it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <p>\"The volume of foreign nationals involved is minuscule so it won't do anything to tackle illegal immigration. They've basically picked on a group of people who have no possibility of objecting to the card - they either comply or they are out.\"</p> <p>The government will start to issue cards to British and foreign nationals within the European economic area who work in sensitive roles or locations from next year, starting with airport workers. </p> <p>From 2010, the government will target young people to get an identity card on a voluntary basis \"to assist them in proving their identity as they start their independent life in society\", with full roll-out to all British citizens starting from 2011.</p> <p>The Conservatives have vowed to scrap the ID scheme if they form the next government. </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, said that ID cards were an \"expensive white elephant\".</p> <p>\"Whilst we support strengthening biometric technology for use in visas and passports, this should not be used as cover to introduce the identity card scheme by stealth,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The government are kidding themselves if they think ID cards for foreign nationals will protect against illegal immigration or terrorism - since they don't apply to those coming here for less than three months.</p> <p>\"ID cards are an expensive white elephant that risk making us less - not more - safe. It is high time the government scrapped this ill-fated project.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats said the cards' \"fancy design\" did not detract from the fact that they remained an intrusion into people's liberty.</p> <p>Chris Huhne, the party's home affairs spokesman, said: \"It does not matter how fancy the design of ID cards is, they remain a grotesque intrusion on the liberty of the British people.</p> <p>\"The government is using vulnerable members of our society, like foreign nationals who do not have the vote, as guinea pigs for a deeply unpopular and unworkable policy. When voting adults are forced to carry ID cards, this scheme will prove to be a laminated poll tax.\"</p>",
  "<p>A ruptured gas pipeline in Australia and the return of damaging hurricanes to the Caribbean were among the catastrophes that halved profits at Lloyd's of London in the first six months.</p> <p>Lloyd's, the world's oldest insurance market, said today that a sharp decline in investment income was also responsible for its first decline in interim profits for two years. It reported pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 of \u00a3949m, down 47% from \u00a31.81bn in the same period last year.</p> <p>Lloyd's chief executive Richard Ward said the second half of the year, which will include damages claims from hurricanes Gustav and Ike, could put further strain on insurance syndicates that provide cover for homes and businesses on the US eatern seaboard.</p> <p>He said: \"The market remains in a good position to face the challenges ahead even though the external conditions in which we operate are about to test our structure and resolve.\" </p> <p>Ike, which was the third major hurricane this year, flattened the Texan town of Galveston and caused an estimated $27bn of damage. Lloyds suffered badly in the wake of hurricane Katrina in 2005 which flooded New Orleans and cut a swathe through Missisippi. It subsequently increased premiums, but last year it said increased competition had softened rates.</p> <p>Lloyds, a society of corporate underwriters and wealthy individuals that make insurance transactions through managing agents and syndicates, currently makes 40% of its premium income in the US.</p> <p>Rising sea levels and a higher frequency of violent storms has failed to deter Americans from moving to the coast, especially in vulnerable areas around Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>The prospect of higher risks and lower premiums has forced Lloyds to seek business outside the US and earlier this month the group signalled its intention to diversify by moving deeper into emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and the Gulf, which Lloyd's chairman Lord Levene called the \"markets of the future\".</p> <p>Levene said: \"We have reported a strong performance in extremely challenging circumstances.\"</p> <p>He said that the costs of American hurricanes Gustav and Ike will damage earnings, although it is still too early to determine exactly how big those multibillion pound costs will be.</p> <p>\"The second half will remain subject to the incidences of natural catastrophes,\" said Levene.</p> <p>Levene said investment income was restricted, but a cautious approach had protected the market's stockpile of assets of \u00a31.9bn. A spokesman said: \"A conservative investment mix has resulted in a positive return of approximately 1%, which outperformed many peers, but showed the impact of the extreme volatility in the capital markets, with both equity and bond holding adversely affected.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>Residents of the Scottish Borders fear they will be \"swamped\" by news from the major cities of north-east England now Ofcom has given ITV the official go-ahead to cut back its regional news. </p> <p>The statutory regulator has approved ITV plans to merge a number of regions including Borders and neighbouring Tyne Tees in the north-east. ITV wants to rationalise news bulletins from 17 separate programmes to nine.</p> <p>ITV plans to merge the Borders' half-hour Lookaround programme with Tyne Tees' regional news \u2013 but will maintain a 15-minute opt-out for local news in north-west England and neighbouring areas in Scotland.</p> <p>Cheryl Broad, a solicitor in Carlisle who has been campaigning to save Lookaround, told MediaGuardian.co.uk she was \"really disappointed\" by Ofcom's decision.</p> <p>\"The north-east has bigger cities and there's a lot more things happening than in Cumbria so we'll just get overtaken by north-east news and things like the local football team, Carlisle United, probably won't get any coverage,\" Broad said. </p> <p>\"It's half an hour at the moment for the whole of Cumbria, the Isle of Man and south-west Scotland and it's difficult even with that to cover everything. With 15 minutes you'll just get the major stories and bad news and all the other local things that are happening will get overlooked and won't be seen as important.\"</p> <p>Broad said the alternatives were local newspapers and websites such as ITV Local but noted the area had a high population of elderly people and low internet usage.</p> <p>Adam Powell, National Union of Journalists representative for ITV Borders, said Ofcom had shown \"utter contempt\" for the tens of thousands of people who had written in to save their local news programme.</p> <p>\"It will be a much poorer service \u2013 you can't fit in the area we cover in 15 minutes, there are stories we'll miss and stories we don't cover,\" Powell said.</p> <p>He added that it was foolish to expect a fair showing for Cumbria in the main bulletin before the dedicated 15 minutes.</p> <p>\"We'll be swamped by stories from the north-east \u2013 there might be some tokenistic Borders stories when the new programme starts but that will eventually fade away because the hard news stories are generated out of the north-east from the large conurbations of Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesborough.\"</p> <p>Powell said the impact on Border Television's 70 journalists was not yet clear but he believed two out of three jobs could be at risk.</p> <p>Alan Cleaver, deputy editor of Whitehaven News in Cumbria, said BBC Northeast gave only token coverage to Cumbria and there was a fear ITV would do the same.</p> <p>\"That's what people fear will happen now with news from Tyne Tees and one story [from Cumbria] and that will be it,\" Cleaver said.</p> <p>\"The size of Cumbria and its rural nature has always made it difficult to get news \u2013 you have Carlisle in the north and Kendall in the south and a lot of small towns in between that are likely to be very poorly served now.\"</p> <p>Cleaver said his newspaper company was investing in hyper-local websites but would not benefit from the reduced competition.</p> <p>\"Television news creates an extra hunger for local news \u2013 if people see something on TV they might think, 'I must find out more' and hopefully buy the paper or log on to the web the next day.\" </p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

We were lucky enough to find some blood-red beefsteaks and delicate little purple mushrooms at our local farmers' market last weekend, alongside the usual oysters and chanterelles. We saut\u00e9ed them in butter with onions and garlic, added a splash of cider and a hearty dollop of creme fraiche, and served them with pork chops. Truly, truly delicious. Beware, though: not all types of beefsteak mushrooms are edible - make sure you buy them from an expert.</p> <p>Yotam Ottolenghi has some fantastic mushroom recipes: try his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/oct/13/weekend7.weekend6\">wild mushroom parcel</a> or his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/dec/16/foodanddrink.recipes1\">mushroom and herb polenta</a>.</p> <h2>CRITIC'S QUOTE</h2> <p>\"[The mutton dripping toast] is the sort of thing that would get you knocked off an NHS gastric-band waiting list before you could shout: 'More, please.'\"<br><em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/21/restaurants.foodanddrink4\">Jay Rayner reviews Market</a> in London's Camden, recently named local restaurant of the year in the London Restaurant Awards.</em></p> <h2>BEST BUY</h2> <p><strong>Morelli's Gelato</strong> in Harrods, London, has created a new range of ice-creams using British delicacies.

Their first beer, <strong>Morrissey Fox Blonde Ale</strong>, has gone into selected pubs and supermarkets this month. You'll be hearing all about the pair in November, when their TV series hits our screens. It's called \u2013 what else? \u2013 Men Brewing Badly.</p> <h2>OFFER OF THE WEEK</h2> <p>Chefs from <strong>Sharrow Bay</strong>, a Michelin-starred restaurant in the Lake District, are taking over the kitchens of Harvey Nichols' Fifth Floor Restaurant for one week, starting today.

  "<p>The first air-conditioned trains on the London Underground, where temperatures regularly top 30C in summer, were today unveiled by the London mayor, Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Presenting a prototype of the \u00a38.5m train in London today, Johnson said it was about time the capital's metro system caught up with the rest of the world: \"They have got air-conditioned trains in New York, they have got them in Los Angeles, so we have got to have it here.\"</p> <p>The new carriages will be rolled out from 2010 on the Hammersmith &amp; City, Metropolitan, District and Circle lines. By the time the deployment is finished in 2015, there will be 191 new trains and several million lightly chilled passengers on the network.</p> <p>But millions more will still be consigned to hot conditions underground because most of the tube network is too small for the new trains. Instead, Johnson has instructed managers to search out hidden water sources, such as the river Fleet, that can be used to cool down the deepest-lying stations.</p> <p>Johnson admitted that passengers on the seven deep lines - including the busy Northern, Central, Victoria and Piccadilly routes - will have to put up with uncomfortable summers for a while yet. While there is room for bulky trains carrying roof-mounted air-conditioning units on the District and Circle line tunnels, it is impossible to fit them into the much smaller deep-lying tunnels. </p> <p>There is also no outlet in those tunnels for any hot air that is pumped out of the carriages, meaning that there would be a \"negative feedback\" effect, whereby hot air will be sucked back into the trains by the conditioning systems.</p> <p>However, Johnson told passengers on the perpetually crowded deep-lying lines not to give up hope: \"We are working flat out to find a solution and we have not abandoned the idea at all. The advent of these new trains will put even more pressure on us to produce an equivalent experience on the deep lines. If you can put a man on the moon there is no reason why we cannot put air-conditioning on the Northern line.\" </p> <p>The new trains, which have nearly 20% more space then their predecessors, will form 40% of the entire rolling stock on the tube network.</p> <p>In the meantime, London Underground is scouring geological maps of the capital to find untapped water sources that can be used to cool down the hottest stations. It is using water from the river Tyburn, which rushes beneath several stations, to drive cool air through Victoria station. It is also looking at putting blocks of ice underneath train seats that will then release chilled air into carriages and is considering putting more industrial fans inside stations after installing 40 this summer.</p> <p>Johnson also warned the government that the trains unveiled today would not be able to reduce overcrowding if they were not accompanied by a multibillion-pound overhaul of old tracks and signalling systems. </p> <p>A funding row between London Underground and the companies charged with doing the work is threatening those upgrades. Johnson said the government was \"morally responsible\" for solving the financial problems because it imposed the troubled Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme that was supposed to carry out the work.</p> <p>\"The government is morally responsible for the design of the PPP which it imposed on London and which has done absolutely nothing to protect the taxpayer or indeed the farepayer,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Speculation is rife about the ins and outs of a possible reshuffle expected at end of next week. Who should stay, who should go? </p> <p>We now know that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/25/gordonbrown.ruthkelly\">Ruth Kelly won't be in the next cabinet</a>. Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, is tipped to replace Peter Mandelson as European commissioner next year, but that would mean another dreaded byelection for Labour in the <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/hoc/constituency/0,,-678,00.html\">Ashfield</a> constituency in Nottinghamshire, where Hoon holds a majority of 10,213. If he goes to Europe, it won't be for a while. </p> <p>In the meantime, Hoon could be moved to take Kelly's transport secretary brief, which would make way for Brown's ally and deputy chief whip Nick Brown to be promoted to chief whip. Many MPs fear Brown (Nick) and this is a good thing for whips charged with maintaining order in the parliamentary Labour ranks. <br> Could Ed Balls leave the Department for Children, Families and Schools to replace Alistair Darling as chancellor? Darling's assured speech at the party conference might save him, and anyway, is it wise to change your Treasury team in the middle of an global economic crisis? </p> <p>Could Jacqui Smith leave the Home Office for education? Immigration minister Liam Byrne is seen as a cabinet contender, though a conviction last year for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/02/ukcrime.immigrationpolicy\">driving while using his mobile phone</a> is a smudge on an otherwise impeccable political CV which would probably rule him out for promotion in the Home Office. </p> <p>Another minister from the same department, Tony McNulty, is also seen as a potential winner in a shakeup. So too is Cabinet Office minister Ed Miliband, seen as a Brown loyalist, who might wrest environment from Hilary Benn. </p> <p>There is talk that Europe minister Jim Murphy is gearing up to head a new department of the nations, to replace the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland offices. </p> <p>Which leaves us wondering if Brown's critics and his enemies will be targeted for demotion. Would the PM entertain moving David Miliband from the Foreign Office, or would that only serve to underline the threat posed by the young pretender to Brown's job? It would depend on whether he was moved to another heavyweight role - say the Home Office - or was demoted. Will other Blairites be weeded out \u2013 Hazel Blears, John Hutton, James Purnell? </p> <p>Also doing the rounds is the prospect of Harriet Harman losing some of her myriad responsibilities. At the moment Harman is juggling several roles in the Commons: leader of the House of Commons, secretary of state for equalities, minister for Women, deputy Labour leader and lord privy seal. </p> <p>And what about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/25/labourconference.taxandspending\">Jon Cruddas</a>, the darling of the left who had a good show in Manchester?</p> <p>How should Brown compose his next cabinet? Should he tweak, should he go large, or should he leave it well alone? What fantasy Team GB would you put in place to maximise Labour's chances of leading, rather than trailing, in the polls? Over to you.</p>",

  "<p>Phil Taylor is an unusually fidgety, chatty, twitchy kind of ice-cool sporting legend. The Power is 48 years old now: winner of 75 major tournaments, 13-time world champion, the first darts player to hoover up more than \u00a31m in prize money, and a man in a rich vein of form ahead of Sunday's South African Masters. You'd think by now Stoke's darting colossus might be ready to bask, leonine, in the glow of his accumulated glories. Or at least just to settle back and talk about darts a lot.</p> <p>Except, he doesn't really seem to fancy it. Other topics keep grabbing his attention. During the course of a two-hour chat at his house on the green fringes of Stoke, the Power disappears briefly to chop up a turnip, telephones John Terry, fixes a problem with his oven, talks with great enthusiasm about staying with Robbie Williams in Los Angeles and offers some weighty professional admiration for the accuracy of Rory Delap's long throw. All right Phil. Now, back to the darts ... Phil?</p> <p>This is a bit of a surprise. From a distance the most interesting thing about Taylor is his utter single-mindedness, the unwavering stare of the ultimate warrior of the oche. This has been the story of his career too. Until last year, his 21st in competitive darts, Taylor had never experienced a dip in form. His record is a match for anyone in any sport. Whatever it is that he's got, it cuts through the backyard rough and tumble of darts and speaks to the sporting gods, the cross-disciplinary aristocracy of the dead-eyed career winner. So what is it, then, the Power's special power? And how do you get some?</p> <p>\"Some of the lads say to me, \"What's the secret?\"\" he shrugs. \"I say 'get four kids'. It focuses your mind. It's not easy. You've got to provide for them, put shoes on their feet, food on their plates. I suppose it's just in you. It's that moment when you either win or lose. You've either got it or you haven't got it. It's not about practice. You can practise as much as you want, but you can't practise shitting yourself.\"</p> <p>That moment - the match-closing pick-off, the shit-yourself last leg 180 - is what big league darts is all about. It's sport reduced to its most simple formula. There's nowhere to hide in darts, no bad luck, no ref to blame: there you are, pinned and wriggling on the wall. And these big moments are what Taylor handles so much better than anybody else. If he has a secret, it seems to be an unusual relish for raw man-to-man combat.</p> <p>\"With darts it's just one against one, it's blow for blow. The only thing I could compare it to is boxing. It's dead exciting. You're reacting to each other, the adrenaline's pumping. You don't feel calm at all. But it's all about being able to win when you're pumped up. People say you don't play the player; I play the player every time.</p> <p>\"It's about reading the body language. I can see it in other sports. I can see when people's minds are wrong. You can see when a footballer's going to miss a penalty. In darts you wait for that dip and then you hit them hard.\" And of course, this kind of dip never happens to the Power. \"No. I just keep on coming.\"</p> <p>There was a period when Taylor wasn't quite so sure. Eighteen months ago he seemed to be in the process of being overhauled by a generation of eager young darters, buff and unsmiling athletes of the oche, young men who see a good living in the game and treat it like any other high stakes pay-TV sport (\"cocky,\" he calls them with a smile).</p> <p>At one point Taylor even engaged a sports psychologist and became an enthusiastic convert, listening to tapes of crowd noise, sitting through his pre-match Oasis psyche-up CD, doing his visualisations. \"Didn't do me any good at all,\" he says now. \"I wouldn't bother with it. They tell you things you already know. You can't teach people to win, it's in you, you've either got it or you haven't.\"</p> <p>Whatever it is, Taylor got it back - and triumphantly. So far this year he's won the Las Vegas Classic, a second US Open and twelve PDC Pro Tour events. In August he won the World Matchplay, beating young pretender James Wade 18-9, and ending the match with a final bull from the side of the oche to slip past another dart, a shot commentator Sid Waddell described as the best he had ever seen. \"I forget these things,\" he says of that feted bull. \"I'd forgotten until you reminded me. All I can remember is doing the karaoke with Joe Longthorne after.\"</p> <p>He will admit to being a little suspired by his own new-found boldness. \"When I started out as a pro, me, Jocky, Eric, Lowey, we never used to get those kind of shots. You just didn't go for them. But they're doing them all the time now. The youngsters, they're like the snooker players, they go for clear-the-table every time. I thought I'll have a go.\"</p> <p>Can he feel he's nailed a shot like that even before it goes in? \"No.\" Does he ever dream about darts? \"Sometimes, yes, I do. I might be nodding off in my chair and my arm will go like that [flicks it out like a man throwing a snatched dart]. I'll wake up and go 'stop doing that'. Then I'll go back to sleep and do it again. I get annoyed because I wake myself up twitching and throwing darts. It happens every night near enough. I'll be dreaming I'm going for the shot and my arms will go like that and I'll throw it.\"</p> <p>Taylor has a mildly compulsive side. He doesn't let himself play golf regularly (\"I'd get obsessed with it\"). Even taking up swimming as an aid to weight loss ahead of the winter season has led to him musing on \"getting the strokes right, getting books and learning it right\". Darts is that kind of a sport. You'd think it might appeal to the number-cruncher, the maths crank, the OCD-merchant. But Taylor isn't really any of these. If there's a secret to his special power it doesn't lie this way.</p> <p>For one thing he's too easily distracted by other stuff. In no particular order, during our brief chat Taylor gets lulled into talking about having dinner with Ronnie O'Sullivan, meeting Michael Ballack at an airport, playing darts with assorted Premier League footballers (James Milner is \"a very good player\") and twice compares himself to Stuart Pearce and Roy Keane.</p> <p>Then there's the Robbie Williams connection. A question about epic darting rivalries is somehow diverted into a lengthy revelry on staying with his Stokie homeboy in LA. Pressed on his battles with Dennis Priestley, Taylor instead directs me towards the Brit award nestling next to his darts silverware on the sideboard: \"That's his award on there. Best Song. He gave it to me.\"</p> <p>This is the odd thing about The Power. He doesn't live in exile in Marbella, or hide behind out of town gates. He lives in a cosy semi, the family pad of a pre-Premier League footballer. He makes much of his down-home qualities, and remains thoroughly local, a backyard superstar, well-liked by the mini-cab drivers who ferry me to and from his house and have only positive things to say about their resident champ.<br> But he's also really interested in famous people. He can't help himself. If anything it makes him more likeable, adding a slightly goofy quality. There's an awkward moment when he makes a big thing of calling John Terry only to find the number no longer works. Must have lost his phone or something, we agree, sadly.</p> <p>Probably the drive for success, and that strange blend of feet-on-the-ground and celebrity titillation all have some basis in Taylor's pre-darting life. He comes from famously humble beginnings. His family lived in a house with an upper floor that had been condemned; electricity was siphoned through the wall from next door.</p> <p>As a child Taylor developed his hand-eye co-ordination in the same way as Don Bradman, with long hours on his own spent pinging a golf ball against a garden wall. Taylor was a bowler (\"nothing special, just medium\") and thinks he could have taken it somewhere if he'd concentrated properly.</p> <p>Instead the early years were spent getting on his feet and raising his own young family. Amazingly, he didn't throw a dart until he was 26, having been encouraged to get out to the local pub by his wife, Yvonne. What, you wonder, was he doing with all that focus before he found darts? \"I was weight-lifting,\" he says, unexpectedly. \"I used to body build six or seven days a week. I was really, really fit. I wasn't naturally talented but I was fanatical at it. That's the problem with me, I've got a one-track mind.\"</p> <p>Having arrived at the oche late it only took him two years to win his first trophy, the Canadian Open. \"The first year I played for fun,\" he says. \"The second year I took it serious. I started beating the best players, county players and then I started thinking, I can make a living at this.\"</p> <p>Taylor was famously spotted, and sponsored, by Eric Bristow, who he describes now as \"like my brother\". He says it wasn't until he won his first world championship in 1990, beating Bristow 6-1 in the final, that he felt he'd arrived. \"That year I was with the BDO I won something like 48 out of 50 tournaments,\" he remembers. \"I went from earning \u00a374 a week to maybe \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000.\"</p> <p>Mention of the BDO casts a small shadow. Darts is a sport riven by its own internal apartheid, bleeding from the central fissure between dual governing bodies, a rift around which Taylor's career has been played out. Taylor was one of the top 16 players to jump ship from the BDO for the newly-founded PDC in 1992, encouraged by a new deal with Sky Sports that would take coverage of darts to a new level. A rapprochement between the two bodies still seems as far away as ever. </p> <p>\"I don't think it makes any difference now,\" Taylor shrugs. \"None at all. It doesn't bother me in the slightest. But I still think the BDO are fools for not joining forces. They have got a great structure for bringing players through the rankings. But the players reach a certain standard and they join the PDC because they can't earn a living there. I don't see any promotion at the BDO. I don't see anything being done really.\"</p> <p>It's tempting to wonder if he has any regrets at all: in particular about not being on the BBC, as the BDO world championship is, and finding the recognition outside the sport, the gongs and annual awards, that being a corporation face seems to bring. \"No, I don't,\" he says. \"One thing I am grateful for is that my kids have had a normal life. If I'd have been on ITV or BBC, perhaps we would have had to have a house with a wall around it and electric fencing. I've earned a great living and I don't get the hassle.</p> <p>Taylor was one of 10 nominees for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 2006. It went to Zara Phillips. Did that get to him? \"Noooo. Being a nominee was good enough for me. Anyway Joe [Calzaghe] won it last year and he's on Sky. They've got to start recognising people from other sports. But I don't let it bother me. If I did I'd probably crack up,\" he chuckles, not entirely convincingly.</p> <p>Taylor has suggested he might retire in 2012, but, true to form, he seems quite prepared to backtrack on that. \"What I said was I'd think about it,\" he says. \"I've got a deal with my sponsors that runs out then. I might keep going. We'll see.\"</p> <p>You wonder whether Taylor would be prepared to fade away gently, in the style of Steve Davis, a one-time colossus becalmed in middle-age and losing in the early rounds to opponents he would have swatted aside in his youth. \"No. I couldn't do that. I don't think so. I think it would break my heart. Let's see how it goes. If they start beating me I'll find a way to beat them back. I'll hit them with my walking stick.\"</p> <p>The only time Taylor really settles down to talking darts and stops trying to change the subject to how hard he's been working creosoting his fence or his nascent friendships with Premier League footballers is when the world championship is mentioned.</p> <p>\"Yes, I want it again,\" he says, producing the full-on cold-eyed Taylor stare for the first time. \"I've not won it for two years. I really want to win the world championship. I really want it. I think this year's my best chance. All my gym work, all my training. It's all geared to that. I want it back.\"</p> <p>Never mind JT, Robbie, turnips and all the rest of it. That's The Power right there.</p> <p><em>Coverage of the SA darts championship is live on Nuts TV Sky channel 196 and freeview channel 42 Sunday 28th September at 8pm until 11pm</em></p>",

The moment when people stop being polite about hideous home furnishing experiments, and cut to the chase. The bit where money becomes involved. So while I'm excited about <a href=\"http://dineathon.com/index.html\">Dineathon</a>, a new cookery initiative linked with UN World Food Day on October 16, I'm also ever-so slightly apprehensive about it. </p> <p>The idea is simple: you rustle up a dinner for family or friends; they come over and gobble it all up (or hide it in their handbags as on one unforgettable CDWM episode) \u2014 and then give a donation to charity in return via <a href=\"http://www.dineathon.com/\">dineathon.com</a>. The bit I'm worried about? That the money bit basically becomes the equivalent of scoring: so everyone gives your best mate \u00a310 each for his marvellous roast chicken, and hands you a measly \u00a31.50 for your herb-crusted salmon. </p> <p>Which means your menu had better be up to scratch (or your self-belief unshakable). So what would you cook to impress your guests into parting with their cash? <br><br>Dineathon's launch lunch, which is being prepared by nine super-duper chefs including Eric Chavot and Pierre Koffman, may be a bit beyond most home cooks. On the menu? Cappuccino of forest mushrooms, pickled mushroom salad &amp; parmesan cheese flutes; oyster wontons; slow cooked rump of lamb, crispy sweetbreads, smoked black pudding, sweet potato &amp; garlic puree; Scottish raspberry souffl\u00e9 with bitter chocolate sorbet.</p> <p>Bloody hell. On the Frost menu? Butternut squash and rocket risotto perhaps, maybe bream and chargrilled fennel and lemon, possibly a chocolate mousse from Delia for pudding. But only if I could take the afternoon off work beforehand. So basically risotto, then ice cream (from the shop). That's probably more like it. </p> <p>But what about you? And how much do you think it's fair for people to cough up, given that it is to help other people eat, after all.</p>",
  "<p>Security at Islamabad's international airport has been stepped up following threats of an imminent suicide attack. </p> <p>\"It was a specific threat,\" Ashraf Faiz, Pakistan's senior airport security officer, told reporters. \"The airport is on red alert.\"<br>Officials said although a deadline mentioned in the telephone warning had passed, security at airports would remain elevated.</p> <p>Pakistan is already on high alert after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/pakistan.terrorism1\">massive bomb devastated the Marriott hotel</a> in Islamabad on Saturday, killing 53 people. The country's security situation has been deteriorating for months, with an increasing number of bomb attacks by militants. </p> <p>There is growing anger at Pakistan's relationship with the US, which has recently stepped up military attacks on al-Qaida and Taliban strongholds in Pakistan's tribal regions. </p> <p>These strikes have caused outrage among many Pakistanis, who have seen them as an attack on their sovereignty. The group claiming responsibility for the Marriott attack called on Pakistan to stop cooperating with the US.</p> <p>Yesterday, Asif Ali Zardari, the Pakistani president, said international support for Pakistani anti-terror efforts was important, but criticised the US for its military actions in Pakistan. Zardari said they undermined efforts to win \"hearts and minds\" within Pakistan for continuing the country's allegiance with the US. </p> <p>The Pakistani government, led by the party of the assassinated former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, has also criticised its own security agencies for not stopping the violence.</p> <p>\"Stern action by the law enforcing agencies must be taken, as their intelligence agencies are failing miserably,\" the cabinet said in a statement last night.</p> <p>Concerned about the possibility of further attacks, the US has banned all American government personnel from staying at or visiting major hotels in Islamabad and the key cities of Karachi and Peshawar. It has also told them to stay away from restaurants.</p> <p>In addition, the US embassy in Islamabad has urged American citizens working or visiting there to take similar precautions, while announcing it had suspended visa services.</p>"
