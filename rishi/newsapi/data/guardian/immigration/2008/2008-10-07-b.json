  "<p>In real terms, councils are now receiving almost half a billion pounds a year - less government funding - than was planned in last year's comprehensive spending review. Town halls provide more than 800 different services, many of which require petrol or diesel. Councils cannot stop providing vital services that people need and are having to absorb these extra costs. Councils will have to tighten their belts and come up with innovative ways to make their money stretch further. The financial troubles come at a time when an ageing population and a range of pressures across the board are putting a real strain on local government finances. As residents cut back on the amount of money they spend, it is inevitable that demand for services that councils charge for will fall. Councils raise \u00a310.8bn in charges every year. The slump in the housing market can also have a significant effect on the money councils raise, reducing income from services such as land searches, asset sales and receipts from developers that fund new investment.<br><strong>Cllr Margaret Eaton, chair of the Local Government Association</strong></p> <p>Local authorities are having to deal with significant inflationary pressures and are having to absorb the costs. They have made the easier efficiency gains - the low hanging fruit. It is going to be difficult to innovate to get more. Innovation entails risk and they can't afford the risk of failure at this time. A lot of councils have looked at joint purchasing and are working together with local government officers. [Communities and local government minister] John Healey has pledged not to cut the three year settlement to local authorities. But in real terms with inflation and increasing pressure on council services it will be a cut. On the plus side, banks are keen to lend to local authorities as they are seen as a safe bet. We have already seen housing associations buying developments from housing developers and the government has been reviewing how councils' housing revenue accounts work and local authorities are hoping that they may get more freedom to invest in social housing. <br><strong>Alison Scott, assistant director, public sector accounts body Cipfa</strong></p> <p>The government will have to spend its way of this recession, which is the right thing to do when private consumption dries up. 25% of corporate tax revenues and a high amount of income tax revenue comes from the City so its revenues will be hit very hard. The migrant labour market will provide a safety value on unemployment figures so I won't say we we'd expect levels of 3 million. No way will government make cuts in, say, the NHS and council spending. It is just going to run a massive deficit. It is the only body spending money. It may step in and lend to housing associations as the cost of government borrowing is actually falling with people ploughing their money into National Savings and Northern Rock. The government may also have to reopen deals with private sector providers if it can't deliver on contracts. <br><strong>Ian Mulheirn, chief economist at the Social Market Foundation<br></strong></p>",
  "<p>The sun is setting and its dying rays cast triangles of light on to the bodies of the Indian workers. Two are washing themselves, scooping water from tubs in a small yard next to the labour camp's toilets. Others queue for their turn. One man stands stamping his feet in a bucket, turned into a human washing machine. The heat is suffocating and the sandy wind whips our faces. The sprinkles of water from men drying their clothes fall like welcome summer rain.</p> <p>All around, a city of labour camps stretches out in the middle of the Arabian desert, a jumble of low, concrete barracks, corrugated iron, chicken-mesh walls, barbed wire, scrap metal, empty paint cans, rusted machinery and thousands of men with tired and gloomy faces. </p> <p>I have left Dubai's spiralling towers, man-made islands and mega-malls behind and driven through the desert to the outskirts of the neighbouring city of Abu Dhabi. Turn right before the Zaha Hadid bridge, and a few hundred metres takes you to the heart of Mousafah, a ghetto-like neighbourhood of camps hidden away from the eyes of tourists. It is just one of many areas around the Gulf set aside for an army of labourers building the icons of architecture that are mushrooming all over the region. </p> <p>Behind the showers, in a yard paved with metal sheets, a line of men stands silently in front of grease-blackened pans, preparing their dinner. Sweat rolls down their heads and necks, their soaked shirts stuck to their backs. A heavy smell of spices and body odour fills the air. </p> <p>Next to a heap of rubbish, a man holds a plate containing his meal: a few chillies, an onion and three tomatoes, to be fried with spices and eaten with a piece of bread. </p> <p>In a neighbouring camp, a group of Pakistani workers from north and south Waziristan sit exhaustedly sipping tea while one of them cooks outside. In the middle of the cramped room in which 10 men sleep, one worker in a filthy robe sits on the floor grinding garlic and onions with a mortar and pestle while staring into the void. </p> <p>Hamidullah, a thin Afghan from Maydan, a village on the outskirts of Kabul, tells me: \"I spent five years in Iran and one year here, and one year here feels like 10 years. When I left Afghanistan I thought I would be back in a few months, but now I don't know when I will be back.\" Another worker on a bunk bed next to him adds: \"He called his home yesterday and they told him that three people from his village were killed in fighting. This is why we are here.\" </p> <p>Hamidullah earns around 450 dirhams (\u00a370) a month as a construction worker. </p> <p>How is life, I ask.</p> <p>\"What life? We have no life here. We are prisoners. We wake up at five, arrive to work at seven and are back at the camp at nine in the evening, day in and day out.\" </p> <p>Outside in the yard, another man sits on a chair made of salvaged wood, in front of a broken mirror, a plastic sheet wrapped around his neck, while the camp barber trims his thick beard. Despite the air of misery, tonight is a night of celebration. One of the men is back from a two-week break in his home village in Pakistan, bringing with him a big sack of rice, and is cooking pilau rice with meat. Rice is affordable at weekends only: already wretched incomes have been eroded by the weak dollar and rising food prices. \"Life is worse now,\" one worker told me. \"Before, we could get by on 140 dirhams [\u00a322] a month; now we need 320 to 350.\" </p> <p>The dozen or so men sit on newspapers advertising luxury watches, mobile phones and high-rise towers. When three plastic trays arrive, filled with yellowish rice and tiny cubes of meat, each offers the rare shreds of meat to his neighbours. </p> <p>All of these men are part of a huge scam that is helping the construction boom in the Gulf. Like hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, they each paid more than \u00a31,000 to employment agents in India and Pakistan. They were promised double the wages they are actually getting, plus plane tickets to visit their families once a year, but none of the men in the room had actually read their contract. Only two of them knew how to read. </p> <p>\"They lied to us,\" a worker with a long beard says. \"They told us lies to bring us here. Some of us sold their land; others took big loans to come and work here.\" </p> <p>Once they arrive in the United Arab Emirates, migrant workers are treated little better than cattle, with no access to healthcare and many other basic rights. The company that sponsors them holds on to their passports - and often a month or two of their wages to make sure that they keep working. And for this some will earn just 400 dirhams (\u00a362) a month.</p> <p>A group of construction engineers told me, with no apparent shame, that if a worker becomes too ill to work he will be sent home after a few days. \"They are the cheapest commodity here. Steel, concrete, everything is up, but workers are the same.\" </p> <p>As they eat, the men talk more about their lives. \"My shift is eight hours and two overtime, but in reality we work 18 hours,\" one says. \"The supervisors treat us like animals. I don't know if the owners [of the company] know.\" </p> <p>\"There is no war, and the police treat us well,\" another chips in, \"but the salary is not good.\"</p> <p>\"That man hasn't been home for four years,\" says Ahmad, the chef for the night, pointing at a well-built young man. \"He has no money to pay for the flight.\" </p> <p>A steel worker says he doesn't know who is supposed to pay for his ticket back home. At the recruiting agency they told him it would be the construction company - but he didn't get anything in writing.</p> <p>One experienced worker with spectacles and a prayer cap on his head tells me that things are much better than they used to be. Five years ago, when he first came, the company gave him nothing. There was no air conditioning in the room and sometimes no electricity. \"Now, they give AC to each room and a mattress for each worker.\" </p> <p>Immigrant workers have no right to form unions, but that didn't stop strikes and riots spreading across the region recently - something unheard of few years ago. Elsewhere in Mousafah, I encounter one of the very few illegal unions, where workers have established a form of underground insurance scheme, based on the tribal structure back home. \"When we come here,\" one member of the scheme tells me, \"we register with our tribal elders, and when one of us is injured and is sent home, or dies, the elders collect 30 dirhams from each of us and send the money home to his family.\"</p> <p>In a way, the men at Mousafah are the lucky ones. Down in the Diera quarter of old Dubai, where many of the city's illegal workers live, 20 men are often crammed into one small room. </p> <p>UN agencies estimate that there are up to 300,000 illegal workers in the emirates. </p> <p>On another hot evening, hundreds of men congregate in filthy alleyways at the end of a day's work, sipping tea and sitting on broken chairs. One man rests his back on the handles of his pushcart, silently eating his dinner next to a huge pile of garbage. </p> <p>In one of the houses, a man is hanging his laundry over the kitchen sink, a reeking smell coming from a nearby toilet. Next door, men lie on the floor. They tell me they are all illegal and they are scared and that I have to leave. </p> <p>Outside, a fistfight breaks out between Pakistani workers and Sri Lankans. </p> <p>The alleyways are dotted with sweatshops, where Indian men stay until late at night, bending over small tables sewing on beads. </p> <p>A couple of miles away, the slave market becomes more ugly. Outside a glitzy hotel, with a marble and glass facade, dozens of prostitutes congregate according to their ethnic groups: Asians to the right, next to them Africans, and, on the left, blondes from the former Soviet Union. There are some Arab women. Iranians, I am told, are in great demand. They charge much higher prices and are found only in luxury hotels. </p> <p>Like the rest of the Gulf region, Dubai and Abu Dhabi are being built by expat workers. They are strictly segregated, and a hierarchy worthy of previous centuries prevails. </p> <p>At the top, floating around in their black or white robes, are the locals with their oil money. Immaculate and pampered, they own everything. Outside the \"free zones\", where the rules are looser, no one can start a business in the UAE without a partner from the emirates, who often does nothing apart from lending his name. No one can get a work permit without a local sponsor. </p> <p>Under the locals come the western foreigners, the experts and advisers, making double the salaries they make back home, all tax free. Beneath them are the Arabs - Lebanese and Palestinians, Egyptians and Syrians. What unites these groups is a mixture of pretension and racism. </p> <p>\"Unrealistic things happen to your mind when you come here,\" a Lebanese woman who frequently visits Dubai tells me as she drives her new black SUV. \"Suddenly, you can make $5,000 [\u00a32,800] a month. You can get credit so easy, you buy the car of your dreams, you shop and you think it's a great bargain; when you go to dinner, you go to a hotel ... nowhere else can you live like this.\"</p> <p>Down at the base of the pyramid are the labourers, waiters, hotel employees and unskilled workers from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, the Philippines and beyond. They move deferentially around the huge malls, cafes, bars and restaurants, bowing down and calling people sir and madam. In the middle of the day, during the hottest hours, you can see them sleeping in public gardens under trees, or on the marble floors of the Dubai Mosque, on benches or pieces of cardboard on side streets. These are the victims of the racism that is not only flourishing in the UAE but is increasingly being exported to the rest of the Middle East. Sometimes it reminds you of the American south in the 1930s. </p> <p>One evening in Abu Dhabi, I have dinner with my friend Ali, a charming Iraqi engineer whom I have known for two decades. After the meal, as his wife serves saffron-flavoured tea, he pushes back his chair and lights a cigar. We talk about stock markets, investment and the Middle East, and then the issue of race comes up. </p> <p>\"We will never use the new metro if it's not segregated,\" he tells me, referring to the state-of-the-art underground system being built in neighbouring Dubai. \"We will never sit next to Indians and Pakistanis with their smell,\" his wife explains.</p> <p>Not for the first time, I am told that while the immigrant workers are living in appalling conditions, they would be even worse off back home - as if poverty in one place can justify exploitation in the other.</p> <p>\"We need slaves,\" my friend says. \"We need slaves to build monuments. Look who built the pyramids - they were slaves.\" </p> <p>Sharla Musabih, a human rights campaigner who runs the City of Hope shelter for abused women, is familiar with such sentiments. \"Once you get rich on the back of the poor,\" she says, \"it's not easy to let go of that lifestyle. They are devaluing human beings,\" she says. \"The workers might eat once a day back home, but they have their family around them, they have respect. They are not asking for a room in a hotel - all they are asking for is respect for their humanity.\"</p> <p>Towards the end of another day, on a fabulous sandy beach near the Dubai marina, the waves wash calmly over the beautiful sand. A couple are paragliding over the blue sea; on the new islands, gigantic concrete structures stand like spaceships. As tourists laze on the beach, Filipino, Indian and Pakistani workers, stand silently watching from a dune, cut off from the holidaymakers by an invisible wall. </p> <p>Behind them rise more brand-new towers. </p> <p>\"It's a Green Zone mentality,\" a young Arab working in IT tells me. \"People come to make money. They live in bubbles. They all want to make as much money as possible and leave.\" </p> <p>Back at the Mousafah camps, a Pakistani worker walks me through his neighbourhood. On both sides of the dusty lane stand concrete barracks and the familiar detritus: raw sewage, garbage, scrap metal. A man washes his car, and in a cage chickens flutter up and down. </p> <p>We enter one of the rooms, flip-flops piled by the door. </p> <p>Inside, a steelworker gets a pile of papers from a plastic envelope and shoves them into my lap. He is suing the company that employed him for unpaid wages. \"I've been going to court for three months, and every time I go they tell me to come in two weeks.\" His friends nod their heads. \"Last time the [company] lawyer told me, 'I am in the law here - you will not get anything.\" </p> <p>Economically, Dubai has progressed a lot in the past 10 years, but socially it has stayed behind,\" says Musabih. \"Labour conditions are like America in the 19th century - but that's not acceptable in the 21st century.\"</p>",
  "<p>When there is trouble, call for Peter Mandelson. Gordon did it. He wasn't the first. Two weeks ago, as it looked as if the Chinese government was being engulfed by scandal over the sale of baby milk laced with melamine, the call went out to Mandelson. Come to our country. Help quell the unrest, they pleaded with him. He's a shy man - loth to attract attention - but he went and, in a PR masterstroke, he was photographed drinking milk. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Now one of the side-effects of melamine we read is that those who ingest it can develop kidney stones and, in some cases, it can be fatal but did that worry him? Not in the slightest. He's recovering now and he did what he had to do. By God, he'd do it again. </p> <p>\u2022 For it's important to do the right thing. Shows character; adds immeasurably to one's credibility. At the weekend, the Tories raised all sorts of hell about the investigative tactics of Channel 4's Dispatches, on discovering that one of the programme's researchers made a questionable donation of \u00a3330 to test the party's vetting procedures. This was \"subterfuge and deceit\", Mr Cameron said, and we shall not keep the money. We shall pass it all to charity. At the same time, of course, the Tories face continual questions about the suitability of high-profile donations from the party's benefactor Lord Ashcroft but there is, as yet, no sign of any charity benefiting from that situation. That said, the figures involved are a bit more than \u00a3330. </p> <p>\u2022 \"If you are lucky enough to have some spare money, now could be the time to cash in,\" said the ever-informative Daily Express, addressing the credit crunch yesterday. \"Icelandic bank Icesave pays 7.06% on \u00a31,000 or more on its one-year bond.\" Yeah, right. </p> <p>\u2022 Why all this talk about dumbing down at our elite institutions when standards are clearly as rigorous as ever? The proof: this email from a PhD student of international relations at Cambridge to her distinguished supervisor. \"Can you think of an example or two where British foreign policymakers were especially cautious in their approach and this was the wrong way to go about things?\" she asked him. His wearied reply: \"Appeasement.\"</p> <p>\u2022 And why did the producers of an Australian theatrical production about a tragic and fatal underground cave collapse call it Beaconsfield: A Musical in A-Flat Minor? They must have known it would lead to trouble. They were right. </p> <p>\u2022 What fools we were to believe in the Large Hadron Collider. Scientists will unravel the deepest secrets of our universe, we were told and, like Andrew Marr, we lapped it up. What cobblers. The project has gone quiet since late last month when a tonne of liquid helium leaked into the tunnel. Our man in the white coat got in touch to say it will be quiet for a depressingly long time. \"We had some Norwegian engineers fly in with some really interesting equipment they use to retrieve ice-core samples from deep within glaciers. They sent the rig into the damaged part of the tunnel and the pictures were, uh, impressive,\" he tells us. \"Complete carnage in there - the helium explosion has turned a fair-sized part of the underground into something resembling permafrost. It's going to take a while to thaw out.\" And so the secrets of the universe stay secret. </p> <p>\u2022 And finally, as the world recovers from yet another of the presidential debates, this is Sarah Palin discussing the work of the supreme court with CBS News and Katie Couric: \"Well, let's see. There's - of course - in the great history of America rulings there have been rulings.\" Sarah Palin on geography: \"They are also building schools for the Afghan children so that there is hope and opportunity in our neighbouring country of Afghanistan.\" And this is Melanie Phillips, writing for spectator.co.uk, and concluding that \"Palin's talent, and it is considerable, is to appeal over the heads of her media tormentors and speak directly into the camera and straight to middle America.\" They understand her. Apparently so does Mel. Why are we not surprised?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Troops were deployed on the streets of Bangkok last night to bolster Thai police after a day of clashes with anti-government protesters left two people dead and more than 350 injured.</p> <p>Police fought pitched battles from early morning with demonstrators from the People's Alliance for Democracy (Pad) who gathered outside the Thai parliament as it met in a new session. Two policemen were shot as thousands of protesters massed in an effort to force the resignation of the new prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, accusing him of being a puppet of his deposed predecessor, Thaksin Shinawatra. </p> <p>Somchai escaped the parliament building by crawling through a fence and was evacuated by helicopter. The deputy prime minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who had been the government's chief negotiator with Pad, quit his post. Pad has occupied the grounds of the prime minister's offices for months.</p> <p>The violence was the worst since Pad protesters clashed with pro-government supporters almost two months ago, prompting the prime minister to declare a state of emergency and call troops on to the streets. Last night the army dismissed speculation that the arrival of soldiers on the streets heralded another coup, two years after Thaksin was forced out and sought asylum in Britain after fleeing corruption charges.</p> <p>The demonstrators' siege of parliament delayed proceedings for a time as police fired teargas to try to clear a path to enable MPs to reach the chamber. One man lost a foot from the blast of a teargas grenade.</p> <p>Some protesters broke away and targeted police headquarters, overturning police vehicles, erecting barricades and fighting with sharpened flagpoles.</p>",
  "<p>The outgoing Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra doubled his money in just over a year by making a \u00a320m profit when he sold the club to Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, according to well-placed sources. </p> <p>It is understood that the final price paid to Thaksin remained close to the \u00a3210m originally stated by Amanda Staveley of PCP, who acted as an adviser on the deal. It has not been disclosed how that figure broke down in terms of payments to Thaksin and the club's debts taken over by Sheikh Mansour, but a source confirmed the profit to Thaksin was close to \u00a320m. That represents an almost doubling of Thaksin's money \u2014 he paid \u00a321.6m to buy City in June 2007. The money for the shares leaves around \u00a3170m paid by Sheikh Mansour to take over City's debts.</p> <p>Documents filed at Companies House just before Sheikh Mansour's takeover suggest that Thaksin's investment in the club was greater than has been suggested, at \u00a345.3m. When he bought the club, Thaksin paid the previous major shareholders, John Wardle and David Makin, \u00a317.5m to take over their loans, which at the time amounted to over \u00a323m. That suggests that Thaksin loaned the club a further \u00a322m following his takeover, when players including Elano, Vedran Corluka and Martin Petrov were signed within days. </p> <p>Thaksin admitted this summer, however, that he was unable to fund the club further as \u00a3800m of his assets remained frozen in his native Thailand and criminal proceedings were continuing against him there. After Thaksin and his wife, Pojaman, skipped bail in Thailand on August 11, City's executive chairman, Garry Cook, acknowledged Thaksin was no longer funding the club and City borrowed \u00a325m from Standard Bank. Added to the \u00a345.3m loaned by Thaksin, \u00a341m City owed in loan notes and a further \u00a342.4m accounted for in future stadium rent to Manchester City Council, City's borrowings were around \u00a3154m. As Sheikh Mansour paid \u00a3170m to take on the debts, that indicates that City had further borrowings of around \u00a316m. </p> <p>Last month the Thai Supreme Court issued the fourth arrest warrant for Thaksin to return to face corruption charges. He is reported to have applied for political asylum here.</p>",
  "<p>A controversial American author and conspiracy theorist was arrested in Nairobi and deported yesterday after trying to plug his bestselling book attacking Barack Obama, whose late father was Kenyan. </p> <p>Jerome Corsi arrived in the country last week to promote The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality, an error-riddled book that recently became a bestseller in the US. It falsely claims that Obama, who is revered in Kenya, was raised as a Muslim, and smears the prime minister, Raila Odinga, the country's most popular politician. </p> <p>Corsi had said that he also planned to deliver a $1,000 (\u00a3570) cheque from a conservative website owner to George Obama, the presidential candidate's half-brother who lives in the Kenyan capital's Huruma slum. But by widely publicising his itinerary, Corsi, whether intentionally or not, attracted government attention. Immigration police detained him at a luxury hotel which was due to host the book launch yesterday. </p> <p>Ministry officials, denying the book had anything to do with the arrest, said Corsi had failed to obtain a temporary work permit. He was later taken to Jomo Kenyatta international airport, where he was expected to catch a flight to Europe. </p> <p>Despite Corsi's controversial and often bizarre views - including his claim that President George Bush is pursuing a \"North American Union\" comprising the US, Canada and Mexico - he has already proved an ability to influence American politics. In 2004 he helped sink the Democratic presidential campaign by co-authoring \"Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry\". </p> <p>He dedicated a chapter in his latest book to \"Kenya, Odinga, Communism and Islam\", despite having never visited the country. Corsi claimed last week to have been invited to Nairobi by missionaries concerned about the rise of Islam. </p> <p>\"Dr Corsi will also expose details of deep secret ties between US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and a section of Kenya government leaders, their connection to certain sectoral groups in Kenya and subsequent plot to be executed in Kenya should Senator Obama win the American presidency,\" he wrote on the press invitation to the book launch. </p> <p>In the first paragraph of his opening dispatch from Nairobi on Thursday for the conservative WorldNetDaily website, Corsi made clear his agenda, alleging that Odinga, who he claims has close ties to Obama, \"was appointed to the [prime minister] position to stop a wave of violence by Muslim supporters\" protesting against the flawed presidential election. On Friday he claimed Muslims had killed \"50 Christians [who had] sought refuge in a Christian church\" in Eldoret in January. </p> <p>Both claims are false. Kenya's post-election violence was ethnic-based rather than religious. If anything, the Kalenjin perpetrators of the church massacre were Christian. </p> <p>Most of Obama's relatives in Kenya declined to comment yesterday. However, one said that Corsi's planned visit to George Obama, who has stated that he is happy with his life and did not want to become a political pawn, would have been a bad idea. \"I don't think the people in Huruma would have welcomed him.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jim Thompson has just been told that there's no chance of an increase on his \u00a390 loan from the Social Fund. \"There's 35 quid left to last us another seven days,\" he says. By \"us\" he means himself, his pregnant, unemployed girlfriend Jan Mason, 27, and their 12-month-old baby, Michelle. Thompson slumps wearily over the railings at the side of Ladywood community centre in inner-city Birmingham. Then he straightens up and, for a moment, he looks the part of a 25-year-old former soldier who has served in Northern Ireland, Kosovo and Bosnia.</p> <p>\"I'd rather starve than let them go hungry,\" he adds with a defiant gesture at his family. \"We might be short of money, but we're not short of love.\" Certainly, Michelle doesn't look short of care and attention. But she will grow up in the constituency pinpointed last week as having a higher proportion of its children living in poverty than any in the UK; 81% of families in the area are struggling, which directly affects some 28,420 of its children, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/01/clare.short.child.poverty\">figures from the Campaign to End Child Poverty</a>.</p> <p>Thompson was doing comparatively well until three weeks ago, when he lost his job laying carpets for a hotel chain. \"They're not fitting out any more hotels until the economy picks up,\" he says. Next week, he might - just might - get the redundancy money he has been promised. Meanwhile, the rent is due on the family's two-bedroom flat in a nearby tower block.\"Then all I've got to find is the money for food, electricity, milk and nappies,\" he adds bitterly. \"I've been to umpteen building sites trying to get labouring work, but the construction firms are cutting back as well.\"</p> <p>So Thompson and his family become another statistic. The constituency's unwelcome reputation is based on a 45% jobless level, combined with another 36% receiving working tax credit to bolster meagre incomes. This part of Birmingham is no longer packed with factories offering comparatively well-paid work. The local government ward of Ladywood, a largely 1960s-built estate, butts right up against the canal-side apartments and restaurants of the city centre. Not far, indeed, from the International Convention Centre where the Conservative party conference gathered last week. Yet the government that Tory leader David Cameron blames for what he calls \"our broken society\" has invested hundreds of millions in a parliamentary constituency that includes not only the ward and the city centre itself but also inner-city Aston, Nechells and parts of Handsworth.</p> <p>However, its neighbourhoods have turned into what Jenny Phillimore, from the Centre for Urban and Regional Studies at Birmingham University, calls \"microcosms of super-diversity\", with constantly changing populations. \"Yes, the government had put a lot of money into regeneration, but, at the same time, Ladywood has become a reception area for immigration,\" she says.\" The poorest people come here because there's a lot of cheap, rented social housing.</p> <p>\"We've found Kurdish and African families with nine and sometimes 11 people living in two-bedroom flats. Those who are here legally are starting to bring their families in, but they're not entitled to any public funds. Without money for uniforms or bus fares, they're not sending their children to school.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, among the settled population, there's a high level of dropping out from an education system on which children depend for qualifications for any but the most menial jobs. </p> <p>Kenneth Jeffers, 55, a former education minister in Montserrat, came to Ladywood soon after a volcanic eruption on the Caribbean island in the 1990s. He spends much of his time at the Sky Rainbow Foundation, which tries to raise the horizons of black youths. \"In the Caribbean, our children's learning curve starts to improve after the age of 11,\" he says. \"Here, it seems to peak at 11 and then start to decline.\" Jeffers wants to set up exchange deals between schools in Birmingham and the West Indies.</p> <p>As it is, plenty of children are too frightened to leave their corner of Ladywood. The gun violence plaguing the area is largely based on postcode territorialism. Former social worker Udel James, 50, holds a photograph of her nephew. A fresh-faced black boy, he was shot dead for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p> <p>James's response is to set up One B Outreach, running a minibus to occasional residential weekends in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. To these youngsters - white and Asian, as well as black - it's as remote and exotic as the Caribbean. \"There's a lot of tension at first,\" James concedes. \"But, by the end of the weekend, they're all asking: 'Why do we have to go home, miss?'\" It's an understandable question in the circumstances.</p> <p>\u2022 The names of Jim Thompson and his family have been changed at his request</p>",
  "<p>On Sunday at the world's richest football club, no fans could be spotted with tea-towels on their heads, but delirium lingers on. It remains surreal to read in the programme at a Manchester City match against Liverpool that it was: \"The first home game for our new owners, led by His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, represented by our new chairman, His Excellency Khaldoon Al Mubarak.\"</p> <p>With City 2-0 up before Liverpool's masterly fightback, City's fans launched into \"We're not really here\" - though not in disbelief at seeing Robinho in a sky blue shirt now; the anthem was minted during City's season in the old Division Two 10 years ago by fans finding themselves on terraces at clubs like Macclesfield and York. The fans' immovable loyalty in that third-flight season cemented City's status as a big club and legitimised the local council's decision to hand City the new publicly funded stadium after the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and those two factors made City, for all its unpredictability, eminently desirable to buy.</p> <p>Since the hysteria fired by Sulaiman Al Fahim, Sheikh Mansour's dealmaker, bragging of \"very deep pockets\" and talking fantasy football, a more respectful tone is marking City's new era. In an open letter to \"fellow Manchester City fans\", Sheikh Mansour stressed loyalty to the manager, Mark Hughes, an understanding that \"it takes time to build a team\", the importance of the academy and homegrown players, an appreciation of City's history and a commitment to the community work the club's staff do in some of Manchester's grim neighbourhoods.</p> <p>The letter emphasised that although Sheikh Mansour is a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling dynasty, he has bought City \"in a private capacity\", part of his \"strategy to hold a wide portfolio of business investments\". Few, though, doubt that the acquisition of a major Premier League club is part of the broader moves to enhance the national appeal of Abu Dhabi itself. </p> <p>A central figure working on the City takeover for Mansour, alongside Khaldoon, has been Simon Pearce, an English expatriate who is the strategic communications director of the Executive Affairs Authority, a policy arm of the Abu Dhabi government. </p> <p>In November 2007 Pearce, who is thought certain to join the City board, oversaw a new campaign to attract tourism and business partners to the emirate, launching a corporate brand for Abu Dhabi itself. The Office of the Brand of Abu Dhabi emphasises above all, and in detail down to the livery of taxis, that the emirate should be synonymous with: \"Respect, for heritage, family, culture and tradition, for the environment and business, and above all, respect for each other.\"</p> <p>The brand also stresses continuity for Sheikh Mansour's Al Nahyan dynasty, which has ruled Abu Dhabi since the 18th century: \"Respect for leadership which has guided us over the lifetime of our emirate.\"</p> <p>Insiders say it was Pearce who stepped in after Al Fahim's loadsamoney pronouncements and steered the tone back to dignity. The owners won friends at City particularly after Khaldoon spent time with the academy director, Jim Cassell, and on Sunday for inviting former greats into the directors box, including Tony Book and Colin Bell, who were not always given similar prominence by more local owners. </p> <p>Dr Christopher Davidson of Durham University, author of a forthcoming book Abu Dhabi: Oil and Beyond, believes the City acquisition, following the sponsorship of Ferrari's formula one team and investment in top-end sports events and the arts, chimes with this promotion of Abu Dhabi. \"Although the emirate has enormous wealth, they need good relations around the world, to invest their money profitably, and to attract western partners. It is a liberal Muslim country, and although there is no democracy, it is generally peaceful, with the Al Nahyans seen as spending their money generously.\" Davidson added, however, that \"human rights are a blackspot\" - Amnesty International has raised concerns about detention and treatment of migrant workers in the UAE. \"Buying City presents a friendly image,\" he said, \"that these are good guys, who like football, and Abu Dhabi is a safe place to visit and do business.\"</p> <p>Sheikh Mansour, Davidson says, is up and coming among the 19 sons born to Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's long-term ruler who died in 2004. Mansour's mother, Sheikha Fatima, had six sons, which made hers the ruling family's most influential \"mother block\" compared with Sheikh Zayed's other wives. Mansour's influence has grown - he chairs the International Petroleum Investment Company, one of the larger sovereign wealth funds. </p> <p>The family's wealth, indistinguishable with that of the emirate, is almost limitless, with a round $1tn estimated in overseas assets alone. Manchester City is a tiny sliver of that, but bigger than almost anything in terms of publicity, hence the care being taken now to strike the right tone. </p> <p>Neither side has confirmed officially the final price paid by Sheikh Mansour, but informed sources say the total for the club and its debts was close to the originally reported \u00a3210m. Thaksin Shinawatra is understood to have made a \u00a320m profit on the \u00a321.5m he paid for the club. So, with Mansour having paid just over \u00a340m for the club itself, that leaves \u00a3170m of the purchase price made up of City's debts. Companies House documents indicate that Thaksin had \u00a345.3m in loans outstanding personally. According to their most recent accounts, City owed \u00a341m in loan notes, a further \u00a342.4m provided for future stadium rent to the council, and City borrowed \u00a325m from Standard Bank in July this year. Those borrowings, including Thaksin's, add up to \u00a3154m, leaving around \u00a316m other debts. </p> <p>Thaksin, now honorary president of City, stopped funding the club with \u00a3800m of his assets frozen and criminal proceedings continuing in Thailand. Last month the Thai supreme court did not deliver a verdict as expected on the corruption charge against him, and has instead issued four arrest warrants for him to return. According to reports, he has applied for political asylum here. </p> <p>Few at City doubt that Thaksin used the club in his political fight to boost his profile and enable him to return home freely. That failed, and he is now yesterday's man, even at Eastlands, supplanted by the reign of Al Nahyan. </p> <p>In his superb book Manchester: A Football History, Gary James writes of City's beginnings that the club was established in 1880 by the rector's daughter at St Mark's Church, to provide poor, scrapping young lads with something wholesome to do in wretched east Manchester, the smoky side of the world's first industrial city. Now industry is gone and east Manchester's regeneration is based around the football stadium itself and new housing. Sheikh Mansour's bold purchase of the Manchester club happened just as the post-industrial economy, reliant on credit and consumption, was slumping into banking collapse. </p> <p>For all the delight among City fans, there is clearly discomfort within the FA and football generally about so much wealth pouring into one club from a member of a country's government. City's takeover symbolises the wider phenomenon, of world financial power shifting from our credit-exhausted land to east Asia, where they actually make things, and the Middle East, where families who ruled for generations had the great good fortune to discover they were sitting on oil.</p> <h2>Cash for cachet</h2> <p>In the Abu Dhabi \"Brand Briefing\", Simon Pearce, the director of strategic communications for the emirate's Executive Affairs Authority and now a key figure at Manchester City, said \"sponsorships or associations\" should \"epitomise Abu Dhabi\". Sheikh Mansour's City purchase follows other landmark moves in prestigious sports events and the arts</p> <p>Sheikh Mansour led the campaign for Abu Dhabi to host the Fifa <strong>Club World Cup</strong> in 2009 and 2010</p> <p>In 2009 Abu Dhabi will host its first <strong>formula one</strong> grand prix</p> <p>Mubadala Development Company, a government investment vehicle, sponsors <strong>Ferrari's</strong> formula one team</p> <p>Khaldoon Al Mubarak, right, City's new chairman, is the chief executive of Mubadala and was instrumental in the Ferrari sponsorship and securing the <strong>grand prix</strong></p> <p>Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways are now sponsoring <strong>Chelsea</strong></p> <p>The emirate is to spend a reported $1bn on a version of the <strong>Louvre</strong> art gallery, and is also building the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi museum</p>",
  "<p>It takes less than an hour to clone one of Britain's new useless \"microchip\" passports, thanks to the work of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/06/news.terrorism\">Jeroen van Beek</a>, a security researcher at the University of Amsterdam.</p> <p>That technology and other means are critical to many, many Iranians trying to travel. The blue Iranian passport may be ranked second from bottom in the <a href=\"http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/archive/index.php/t-240826.html\">Henley index of travel freedom</a> but that doesn't stop Iranians seeking a document to get out of the millionaire mullahs' country. The government prevents Iranian men from getting a passport if they don't do national service. And so Ayatollah Khamenei allows a roaring trade in illegal passports. The nomenklatura are not affected, as the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=nifea&amp;&amp;sid=a7fJPoIAkw5g\">sons of the wealthy</a> and those of people on the Guardian Council buy off national service. President Ahmadinejad's anti-corruption drive has done nothing \u2013 he is powerless in Iran but for his passport to travel and give speeches around the world. Even his allies have been <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article4107326.ece\">imprisoned</a> when they mention the \"C\" word.</p> <p>I spoke to a man at a north Tehran coffee shop who was ripped off twice. He was given a contact by a friend who had successfully procured a passport for $5,000. They call you. And they never give you their number. The meeting took place in a park and, without any guarantees, money was exchanged. The passport would be ready in a week.</p> <p>Nothing happened. Such is the desperation; he did it again and was ripped off again. \"I think I have found another contact,\" he said. </p> <blockquote> <p>Hopefully, it will work this time. I just have to save up. The thing is that the friend who gave me one of the previous contacts got stopped coming into Imam Khomeini airport last week. He had used his passport four times to travel abroad but the man he bought it from had been caught doing a deal and he revealed the numbers of all the passports he had sold. </p> <p>He got five years and my friend was arrested at the airport and got six months in Evin Prison. He's now doing national service in a desert area in south east Iran \u2013 with an added six months to the normal two years' service.</p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps he was lucky. Under article 15(1) of the 1988 amended Passport Act, the sentence should be 18 months in prison and article 525(2) of the <a href=\"http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/research/rir/?action=record.viewrec&amp;gotorec=450029\">Islamic Penal Code</a> says a \"fake stamp\" in a passport means \"one to 10 years of imprisonment\". </p> <p>There's a big UNHCR office in Tehran, a testament to the US-led wars in <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCRI,,TUR,,485f50daa,0.html\">Iraq</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/country?iso=afg\">Afghanistan</a> that have caused a flow of war-weary refugees into the towns and cities of Iran \u2013 the largest refugee crisis in history.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070611/glain\">According</a> to UNHCR, counterfeit Iranian passports are widely available and the prices change \"according to the quality of the counterfeit work\". While the middle classes opt for buying on the black market, the very poor get to cross borders at will, but that is an ancient trade. Tehranis are rightfully frightened of crossing the porous Pakistan and Afghanistan borders where human trafficking is rife, with police often reporting round-ups of gangs, as well as <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/18/news/border.php\">frequent repatriation</a>.</p> <p>There's stiff border security on the Azerbaijan border and the dhow-route to Oman across the Gulf isn't very useful as it's unlikely any consulate will help an escaping Iranian. Kurds, meanwhile, are on the Turkey-Iran border and cross when they want \u2013 part of a government-sanctioned smuggling route for drugs and alcohol.</p> <p>Women may not have to do national service but face other hurdles. Singles can't get visas to many Gulf countries if they are under 30. Countries like US-backed Saudi Arabia seem to believe that every young Iranian single woman must be a sex worker. And married women need the <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/realitywithbite/lawsiran.htm\">permission of their husband</a> to travel anywhere abroad. Such is the unreconstructed Islamic respect for women.</p> <p>The Bush administration tried to tie in all this counterfeit passport business with its \"war on terror\" and the need to bomb Iran. In 2002, the FBI said it had <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_/ai_94331669\">caught an Iranian gang</a> in Thailand that was busily forging passports and when asked about the supposed connection between Iran and al-Qaida, Thai police had to respond by saying \"they were not certain if the FBI agents were able to establish links between the Iranians and al-Qaida networks in the region or in the US\".</p> <p>The 9/11 Commission report <a href=\"http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm\">absurdly claims</a> that Iran knowingly facilitated transit for al-Qaida militants: \"... operatives ... travelled through Iran, which did not stamp visas directly into passports\". Presumably, the commission didn't understand the difference between Shia and Sunni, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/19/johnmccain.uselections2008\">just like</a> Republican presidential contender John McCain.</p> <p>It's no wonder that tourist guides to Iran advise that a foreigner's passport is his most valuable asset and to keep it strapped about one's person. Actually, crime in the big cities of Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz is much less than one might find in London or Paris. And given that most of Iran's Jewish community chose to ignore a recent Israeli invitation to come and occupy Palestinian land, life in Iran from a regional perspective \u2013 as against the labour camps of Dubai and the US-backed destruction of Iraq \u2013 isn't that bad at all. But for those fighting for more freedom in Iran, passports are a weapon of the state used to destroy their lives. Human Rights Watch accuses the Iranian government of violating its own laws.</p>",

  "<p>When I moved from my native Canada to the UK in 2003, I thought it was ironic that the Doctorows had returned to Europe. My father was born to Polish-Russian parents in a refugee camp in Azerbaijan just before the second world war ended. My grandparents \u2013 deserting Red Army conscriptees \u2013 destroyed their documents and became, in the parlance of the day, Displaced People.</p> <p>When the war ended, they went west again, but when they reached Russia, they kept going. When they reached Poland, they kept going. They moved with the great refugee herd into Germany, to a camp near Hamburg (where my aunt was born), before boarding a refugee boat and sailing to the port of Halifax, where an immigration official truncated their names \u2013 Doctorowicz became Doctorow \u2013 and gave them a train ticket to Toronto, where my great-uncle Max and his family lived.</p> <p>My grandmother is still alive, and sharp as a tack. I asked her recently why they didn't stay in the Soviet Union. Despite her aversion to military service, she was a war hero. She had gone through her adolescence as a civil defence worker during the hard years of the Siege of Leningrad, digging trenches and hauling bodies as a girl of 12, until she was evacuated to Siberia at the age of 15. Her family still lived in Leningrad \u2013 mother, father, baby brother. Leningrad is a majestic city, cosmopolitan and vibrant, even with the war scars on its face. In Toronto she knew no one, didn't speak the language. Her years as a refugee would stretch out for decades until she could truly consider herself a Canadian.</p> <p>I asked her why she didn't stay, and she shook her head like I'd asked the stupidest possible question. \"It was the Soviet Union\", she said. She waved her hand, groped for the answer. \"Papers,\" she said, finally. \"We had to carry papers. The police could stop you at any time and make you turn over your papers.\" The floodgates opened. They spied on you. They made you spy on each other. Your grandfather wouldn't have been allowed to stay \u2013 he was Polish, they wouldn't let him stay with the family in Russia, he'd have to go back to Poland.</p> <p>My head bobbed unconsciously as she told me this. I knew all of it, by way of innuendos and hints over the years, but I had never heard her say it all at once. I'd even seen it firsthand, when we visited the family in Leningrad in 1984, having our conversations cut short when they strayed into political territory, with over-the-shoulder looks for the snoops who might be listening in and waiting to turn my family in to the KGB.</p> <p>Half a century later, the Doctorows came back to Europe. I set up residence in London, working for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an American civil liberties nonprofit, running the European operations. I was privileged to be given status as a \"highly skilled migrant\" (the only visa category I qualified for, given my lack of a university degree). A few years later, I was living with my partner, and had fathered a British daughter (when I mentioned this to a UK immigration official at Heathrow, he sneeringly called her \"half a British citizen\"). We were planning a giant family wedding in Toronto when the news came down: the Home Secretary had unilaterally, on 24 hours' notice, changed the rules for highly skilled migrants to require a university degree. My immigration lawyers confirmed it: people who'd established residence in the UK for years and years, who'd built businesses and employed Britons here, who owned homes and given birth to British children, were being thrown out of the country, taking their tax-payments, jobs and families with them.</p> <p>My partner and I scrambled. We got married. We applied for a spousal visa. A few weeks later, I presented myself in Croydon at the Home Office immigration centre to turn over my biometrics and have a visa glued into my Canadian passport. I got two years' breathing room. My family could stay in Britain.</p> <p>Then came last week's announcement: effective immediately, spousal visa holders (and foreign students) would be issued mandatory, biometric radio-frequency ID papers that we will have to carry at all times. And I started to look over my shoulder.</p> <p>Once again, it seems as though the Doctorows may have to leave Europe. The identity card I'm to be issued when I renew my visa is intended to be linked to all my daily activities: my medical care, my use of transit, my banking and finance, my tax \u2013 a single identifier that will track me through time and space, forever. The dossier thus gathered on me will be managed by the same agencies that have lost (literally) tens of millions' worth of records on British people in the past year alone.</p> <p>It will all be tied to my biometric identifiers, such as fingerprints. Unless you wear gloves at all times, you leave these identifiers behind continuously, everywhere you go. These identifiers are not only available to law enforcement and the state, but to anyone who cares to lift them off any smooth surface you happen to touch. Once these identifiers are compromised, there is no means \u2013 short of amputation \u2013 to change them. Consider the case of German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schauble, who advocates biometric IDs: his fingerprints were lifted from a water-glass at a public debate and published on 10,000 pieces of acetate by a group of media pranksters with no budget and who stood to gain no financial benefit from the stunt. Will well-heeled identity thieves who can use these biometrics to commit crimes and empty bank accounts be less resourceful?</p> <p>The identity card will emit my personal information to people who are at a great distance from me, without my knowledge or consent. The RFID tags in the cards are advertised as only being readable at a few centimetres' distance, like an Oyster card, but, like an Oyster card, security researchers have shown that these cards can be read at tens of metres, and can be cloned using cheap, off-the-shelf technology.</p> <p>So it's fortunate that I got my spousal visa when I did, before these identity papers were made mandatory. Indeed, it's fortunate that I received my spousal visa at all, as Labour moves to limit the number of annual new visas of all kinds to 20,000 people, meaning that Britons who marry foreigners can no longer be assured that they will be able to settle and raise their families in the UK.</p> <p>The national ID card does not exist in a vacuum. It is part of an unprecedented, unparalleled programme to use technology to spy upon and control the movements of people in the UK. Our internet connections are censored and wiretapped by advertisers. Soon, our ISPs will be forced to log and retain the details of all our online activity for snooping by governments, bored employees, or any crook who can hack or bribe his way into the surveillance databases. Our image is captured hundreds of times every time we leave the house. Our number-plates are photographed hundreds of times by traffic cameras, creating a record of where we've been. Our Oyster card data is logged and made available to police, snoops, crooks and anyone else with the resources to get hold of it.</p> <p>We can be arrested and held for weeks without charge. Government tells academics which freely available information about terrorists they are allowed to study and what they are not allowed to look at.</p> <p>We are encouraged to spy on our neighbours and report their suspicious activity. We can be stopped and searched with no particularised suspicion, and during these searches, police officers can and do examine such things as the books we're reading and the personal notes we've made.</p> <p>Every one of these measures was beta-tested on less-advantaged groups before it was rolled out to the general public. CCTVs used the be the exclusive territory of bank vaults and prisons. Network wiretapping and censorship began in schools, \"to protect children\".</p> <p>Now, we immigrants are to be the beta testers for Britain's sleepwalk into the surveillance society. We will have to carry internal passports and the press will say, \"If you don't like it, you don't have to live here \u2013 it's unseemly for a guest to complain about the terms of the hospitality.\" But this beta test is not intended to stop with immigrants. Government freely admits that immigrants are only the first stage of a universal rollout of mandatory biometric RFID identity cards. What happens to us now will happen to you, next.</p> <p>Not me, though. If the government of the day when I renew my visa in 2010 requires that I carry these papers as a condition of residence, the Doctorows will again leave their country and find a freer one. My wife \u2013 born here, raised here, with family here \u2013 is with me. We won't raise our British daughter in the database nation. It's not safe.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Sydney, Australia.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Lisa Mitchell (vocals, guitar).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> There are a lot of female singer-songwriters waiting in the wings at the moment, and our money's on Florence &amp; the Machine to do the business. But there are other contenders to consider. For instance, there's a young Australian singer-songwriter called Lisa Mitchell who is looking very impressive, not just because she's only 18, a month younger than Laura Marling, but also because she's a former contestant on the 2006 edition of Australian Idol and we know what a bunch of karaoke clothes' horses and wailing wannabes that lot tend to be. Not that we're anti-pop TV snobs or have an aversion to former contestants \u2013 Girls Aloud's new single is an absolute stormer by any measure \u2013 but those shows gauge vocal prowess and nothing else. And there's more to Mitchell than an ability to hold a note, although she does that very well indeed, even if her voice is perhaps too idiosyncratic for one of those reality programmes, a little too quavery, kooky and girly. This is probably why she only came sixth on Aussie Idol despite sterling performances of Blondie's Heart of Glass and Coldplay's See You Soon. She should have done Throbbing Gristle's Discipline.</p> <p>Her voice better suits her own songs, which she's been working on back in England, where she was born in Kent before moving with her parents when she was three to Albury in New South Wales. The musicians she's been writing with cover the waterfront, stylistically, and include Turin Brakes, Andy Barlow (Lamb), Sacha Skarbek (James Blunt, Adele), Craig Dodds (Sugababes, Natty, Amy Winehouse), Sam Dixon (Will Young) and Dann Hume of NZ indie-rock band Evermore. Of all the people she's been collaborating with, though, it's acclaimed - but thus far wildly unsuccessful - British singer-songwriter Ed Harcourt (co-writer and keyboardist on her forthcoming debut album) who appears to have made the biggest impression on her music \u2013 a series of candy-coated folk-pop lullabies with deft arrangements and delicate melodies. They've got Harcourt's lightness of touch and blend of the sweet and savage. Meanwhile, production on the album is courtesy Anthony Whiting who has worked with MIA. Mitchell's views on the War On Terror and commitment to the cause of the Tamil Tigers are, as yet, unknown.</p> <p>The name of another singer-songwriter occurs listening to forthcoming single Neapolitan Dreams - Bic Runga, New Zealand's most popular female musician, who also does cute but deadly. We're not the only ones to discern a slightly eerie quality here - one particular washing-liquid company has just used Neapolitan Dreams on their latest advert, and it's more like a Bj\u00f6rk video or a fantasy snippet from Alice In Wonderland than a 60-second soap ad. In fact, it has already been hailed by one wag as The Best Laundry Detergent Ad \u2026 Ever! Surf's up.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Neapolitan Dreams is a cute and soft tinder-box lullaby.

It falsely claims that Obama, who is revered in Kenya, was raised as a Muslim, and smears Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the country's most popular politician. </p> <p>Corsi had said that he also planned to deliver a $1,000 cheque from a conservative website owner to George Obama, the presidential candidate's half brother who lives in Nairobi's Huruma slum. </p> <p>But by widely publicising his itinerary, Corsi, whether intentionally or not, attracted the government's attention. Immigration police detained him at a luxury downtown hotel due to host the launch today. </p> <p>Ministry officials, denying that book had anything to do with Corsi's arrest, said that he had failed to obtain for a temporary work permit on entering the country. He was later taken to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, where he was expected to catch a flight to Europe. </p> <p>Despite Corsi's controversial and often bizarre views - including accusing President George Bush of pursuing a \"North American Union\" comprising the US, Canada and Mexico - he has already proved his ability to influence American politics. In 2004 he helped sink the Democratic presidential campaign by co-authoring Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry. </p> <p>He dedicated a chapter in his latest book to \"Kenya, Odinga, Communism and Islam\", despite having never visited the country. Corsi claimed last week to have been invited to Nairobi by Christian missionaries concerned about the rise of Islam in Kenya. </p> <p>\"Dr Corsi will also expose details of deep secret ties between US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and a section of Kenya Government leaders, their connection to certain sectoral groups in Kenya and subsequent plot to be executed in Kenya should Senator Obama win the American presidency,\" he wrote on the press invitation to the book launch. </p> <p>In the first paragraph of his opening dispatch from Nairobi last Thursday for the conservative WorldNetDaily website, Corsi made clear his agenda, alleging that Odinga \"was appointed to the [prime minister] position to stop a wave of violence by Muslim supporters\" protesting the flawed presidential election. On Friday he claimed Muslims had killed \"50 Christians [who had] sought refuge in a Christian church\" in Eldoret in January.<br> Both claims are false. Kenya's post-election violence was ethnic-based rather than religious. If anything, the Kalenjin perpetrators of the church massacre were Christian. </p> <p>Obama's relatives in Kenya declined to comment today. But one said that Corsi's planned visit to George Obama, who has stated he is happy with his life and did not want to become a political pawn, would have been a bad idea. \"I don't think the people in Huruma would have welcomed him.\"</p>",
  "<p>The American author of a bestselling critical biography of Barack Obama containing the false allegation he was raised a Muslim has been deported from Kenya.</p> <p>Jerome Corsi, who wrote The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality, was picked up by police today for not having a work permit.</p> <p>He was briefly held at immigration headquarters in Nairobi before being brought to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for deportation, according to Joseph Mumira, head of criminal investigations at the airport.</p> <p>Corsi had been scheduled to launch the book today in Kenya. Organisers of the book launch said Corsi had not broken any immigration rules but was considered an embarrassment. </p> <p>\"His papers were found to be in order. His passport was fine, his visa was fine,\" Peter Mbae , his publicist in Kenya, told Reuters. \"But the government did not want him to launch his book on Kenyan soil. That's why he has been deported.\" </p> <p>Immigration officials declined to comment.</p> <p>Obama is a popular figure in Kenya, where his father was a government economist. Several of his extended family still live there. </p> <p>A recent poll found that 89% of Kenyans want Obama to win the US election. </p> <p>In 2004, Corsi was the co-author of Unfit for Command: Swift boat veterans speak out against John Kerry, which was criticised for carrying interviews with people who did not serve in Vietnam with the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate. Many who did said the book's claims were false.</p> <p>The US press has accused Corsi of being anti-Islamic, anti-Catholic, anti-semitic and homophobic, and of exploiting racial prejudices in an attempt to ''scare white America\".</p> <p>Despite this, The Obama Nation and Unfit for Command made it into the New York Times bestseller lists.</p> <p>Corsi writes in The Obama Nation that the presidential candidate is a dangerous and radical prospect to become the leader of the US and makes the false allegations that Obama was raised as a Muslim, and harbours \"black rage\".</p> <p>Obama issued a 40-page rebuttal on his website FightTheSmears.com, under the title Unfit for Publication. He asserts that he is a Christian who attended Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.</p> <p>According to a press release announcing Corsi's visit, he arrived in Kenya last week at the invitation of Christian missionaries concerned about the spread of Islam. He was planning to file daily dispatches all week, the statement said.</p>",
  "<p>Next year is going to be a big one for Scotland. 2009 marks 250 years since the birth of Scotland's favourite bard, <a href=\"http://www.robertburns.org/\">Robert Burns</a>, meaning the celebrations will run long and hard beyond the course of the traditional Burns Night Supper on January 25. <a href=\"http://www.homecomingscotland2009.com\"> Homecoming Scotland 2009</a> will be a year-long programme of cultural and heritage events across the country, including a new festival in April celebrating the legacy of <a href=\"http://www.jmt.org/home.asp\">John Muir</a>, founder of National Parks and one of the most influential people in the environmental movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338329703\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/10/06/clan.jpg\" alt=\"Clan Chief Diarmid Macauley\" width=\"130\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As part of the celebration, VisitScotland has launched <a href=\"http://www.visitscotland.com/real/\">Real Scotland \u2013 The Locals' Guide</a>, which aims to show there is more to Scotland than the usual, familiar landmarks. The guide includes insider tips such as fishermens' favourite fish and chip shops, stonemasons' favourite buildings and caddies' favourite golf courses, as well as a listing of all the events and festivals happening in Scotland over the year. <br> One of the events to look out for will be <a href=\"http://www.clangathering.org/\">The Gathering</a> in Edinburgh (July 25-26), Scotland's largest ever Highland Games with clan members arriving from around the world. Among them will be the <a href=\"http://www.clanmacaulay.org.uk/\">MacAulay clan</a>, whose chief, Diarmid MacAulay (pictured), is \"the only democratically elected chief in Scotland\". </p> <p>Here, he shares his favourite walks in Scotland. He likes to walk, he says, \"with a purpose\". No Munro-bagging for him. Instead, he prefers places with history, which give him a perspective- historical or physical- on the people that populate his favourite landscapes.</p> <h2>1. Quinag, Sutherland</h2> <p>This remote, ice-scoured peak overlooks Diarmid's home in Assynt. For walkers, the steep cliffs and spineback ridge prove spectacular (if relatively easy) sport. The fact that the car park is already at 250m helps with the romp up the grassy lower slopes to the 808m summit. \"From the top, you look across a very ancient landscape,\" says Diarmid. \"It's 3.5 billion years old and fascinating geologically.\" The name of the mountain means \"milking stool\" in Gaelic, he says, while the <a href=\"http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Corrie\">corrie</a>'s name translates as \"byre\". \"The name of the lower slopes, Airigh na Beinne, means 'summer grazing'.\" The whole mountain was once a pasture for \"Scottish <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumance\">transhumance</a>\", he explains. \"Until the people were cleared from the land, of course.\"</p> <p>\u2022 For more information, travel details and accommodation suggestions, see <a href=\"http://www.jmt.org/cuineag-quinag-estate.asp\">Quinag Estate</a> page on the John Muir Trust site. </p> <h2>2. Sandwood Bay, Sutherland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338329417\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/scot6.jpg\" alt=\"Clan chief's favourite walks: Sandwood\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\"It's fantastic. This amazing beach in the middle of nowhere. It feels untouched by human beings.\" Despite its remoteness this perfect arc of sand and dunes is popular with day-trippers. \"It's right next to Cape Wrath. To think the Vikings, even the Spanish Armada sailed past here. It's the history of the place. It's the historical landscape of the place that I find interesting.\" </p> <p>\u2022 For more information see the <a href=\"http://www.jmt.org/sandwood-estate.asp\">Sandwood Estate</a> page at the John Muir Trust site.</p> <h2>3. Dun da Lamh, Invernessshire</h2> <p>This low-level walk in the Cairngorms leads to an Iron Age hill fort with \"fantastic views\". It's not very high, about 500m, but from the summit \"you can look down Loch Spey, and down on to the first ford of the Spey\", where people once waded across the river. \"It's like a frontier fort,\" he says.</p> <p>\u2022 For more information, travel details, and accommodation suggestions, see the <a href=\"http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/cairngorms/dundalamh.shtml\">Dun da Lamh page at walkhighlands.co.uk</a>. </p> <h2>4. Beinn Alligin, Wester Ross</h2> <p>This Torridon giant features two Munros (Scottish mountains over 3,000ft high), making it popular with walkers who are out to bag more than one hill in a day. A highlight is the Horns of Alligin - a great cleft that opens in the mountain. This series of pinnacles provides good scrambling in summer, but is a very serious proposition if there is ice or snow on the ground. \"I built a lot of hill paths here in my younger days,\" explains Diarmid. \"We used to pop up it from time to time.\" It is, he says, \"an amazingly wild area\". At the mountain's base, \"you can see remains of the old shielings [shepherds' huts], where people lived before the clearances\". People would \"summer their cattle\" here, he explains, migrating lower in the winter. \"Winter walking is good for archeology,\" he adds, \"when the bracken is gone.\" To walk the two summits and the Horns takes a full day.</p> <p>\u2022 For more information, see the <a href=\"http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/torridon/beinnalligin/index.html\">Beinn Alligin page at undiscoveredscotland.co.uk</a></p> <h2>5.

It's a very walkable place. A wild place. Fascinating.\" The windswept island, burial place of Scottish kings for centuries, is a mile from Mull, and stretches a tiny one mile by 3.5 miles across. Its religious roots lie in the pre-Christian era, when the island is thought to have been sacred to the Iron Age inhabitants of the Hebrides. Now, visitors flock to the tiny church, <a href=\"http://www.isle-of-iona.com/abbey.htm\">Iona Abbey</a>. In front stands the 9th-century St Martin's Cross, one of the best-preserved Celtic crosses in Britain. Diarmid visited only once, but fell in love with it. \"It's a stunning place of monastic solitude and peace.\"</p> <p>\u2022 For more information, including boat timetables and accommodation options, see <a href=\"http://www.isle-of-iona.com/\">isle-of-iona.com</a></p> <h2>6. Loch Carriagean cairn, Inverness-shire</h2> <p>A real secret. \"On the road to Boat of Garten from Aviemore there's this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairn\">cairn</a>, about 4,000 years old.\" Before the age of steam, the cairn and its sister cairns lay on the old drovers' road north. But when the railway arrived the laying of the track cut it off, isolating it from visitors. \"I discovered it because I read a description of it in an old book,\" says Diarmid. \"You walk across this heathland and here's this series of cairns \u2013 it looks like a burial field.\" To walk from Aviemore takes an hour. \"It looks exactly as described in 1910. It's a wee hidden gem.\"</p> <p>\u2022 To get there, head out of Aviemore on the B9152 going towards Boat of Garten. After about 2km turn right into the road to the Quarry (grid ref: 901 148 on the OS Explorer Map 403, 1:25000). Follow this wee road and cross over the bridge at the railway line. Turn left and follow the track for about 1km to Loch nan Carriagean. The cairn is by the loch with a big Scots pine growing in the middle of the circle. </p> <h2> 7. Portmahomack, Easter Ross</h2> <p>Portmahomack is a planned fishing village, built in the 1700s. \"All the names are Norse. The hotel is lovely, and it's a place for pottering before heading to the pub.\" Of interest is the 6th-century church. \"They've found what they think is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts\">Pictish</a> monastery,\" he explains. \"There are four remarkable stones carved with Pictish symbols. They look across the Firth to another big stone in Elgin.\" The history calls him back he says, as well as the \"easy coastal walking\".</p> <p>\u2022 For more information, see <a href=\"http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/portmahomack/portmahomack/index.html\">undiscoveredscotland.co.uk</a></p> <h2>8. Lairig Ghru, Invernessshire</h2> <p>Diarmid recommends a 22-mile hike through the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2007/jun/02/guardianspecial4.guardianspecial230\">heart of the Cairngorms</a>, eschewing the high peaks for a walk across the valley and over the mountain range's watershed at the Pools of Dee - some of Scotland's remotest terrain. Here, occasional trout rise in black water surrounded on all sides by broken granite and steep glaciated valley walls. Only on the hottest summer's day are they inviting enough for a swim. \"I've built paths from the Braemar side,\" says Diarmid, who has walked the whole route only once. \"And my father organised a winter expedition through here as a member of the RAF, so it has memories for me.\"</p> <p>\u2022 For more information, see the Lairig Ghru page at <a href=\"http://walking.visitscotland.com/walks/cairngorms/lairig_ghru_northwards1\">Walking Scotland</a> </p> <h2>9. Ben Nevis, Invernessshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338329416\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/scot7.jpg\" alt=\"Clan chief's favourite walks: Ben Nevis\" width=\"130\" height=\"220\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At 1,344m (4,409 ft), Britain's highest mountain is a magnet for walkers. Its bulk rises into the mist behind Fort William, presenting a steep slog of at least four hours to the summit. Mountaineering connoisseurs proclaim the much longer northern route, around the Alpine-scale northern buttresses and corries, as superior, but Diarmid prefers to scale it the regular way, up the \"Tourist Path\" from Glen Nevis. \"As a clan we did the three-peaks challenge in 2005,\" he says, \"and flew our flag at top of Snowden, Scafell Pike and Ben Nevis.\" His son led the team, and they completed the whole challenge \u2013 to climb the highest mountains in England, Scotland and Wales in a day \u2013 in 22 hours. \"We got a view. And pretty good weather.\"</p> <p>\u2022 See <a href=\"http://www.mountaineering-scotland.org.uk/leaflets/nevis.html\">here</a> for navigation on Ben Nevis.

Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh</h2> <p>\"We have our own parliament now you know,\" Diarmid says a touch gleefully. It's one of the reasons he likes to climb this 251m extinct-volcanic plug in the centre of Edinburgh \u2013 so he can look down on it and wonder where history will take Scotland next. A road takes you to within 20 minutes of the summit, but walkers will want to hike up from the city, adding an extra hour to the climb. \"Edinburgh was the seat of the Enlightenment, the home of [economist] Adam Smith, the start of all this trouble,\" he says, referring to today's credit crunch. \"It's the start of the modern world. It's stunning to sit there and think about all the people from history,\" he says. \"You mustn't drive it,\" he adds. \"Some people run up it.\"</p> <p>\u2022 For more information on Edinburgh's parks and green spaces, see <a href=\"http://www.edinburghguide.com/parks\">EdinburghGuide.com</a></p>",

  "<p>If Ed Miliband, secretary of state at the new Department for Energy and Climate Change, fails to take radical action to decarbonise the UK's economy, it's not for lack of good, expert advice. Taking pride of place on his desk this morning must be <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">the letter from Adair (Lord) Turner</a>, chairman of the Climate Change Committee, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">makes an unarguable case</a> for deep and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, built on sound science and economics.<br> The 60% <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/10/carbonemissions\">emissions reductions target</a> contained in the Climate bill is not good enough, it says. We need a cut of at least 80% cut by 2050, and this target \"should apply to the sum of all sectors of the UK economy, including international aviation and shipping\". Moreover, the cut can be achieved affordably, costing the UK just 1-2% of GDP in 2050. Given uncertainties about fossil fuel prices, this estimate \u2013 in line with Nicholas Stern's projections in <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">his famous Review</a> \u2013 is close to saying that there will be no cost at all. In the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/06/climatechange.carbonemissions\">event of high fuel prices and supply constraints</a>, decarbonising the UK's economy will almost certainly yield net economic benefits as it ends our dependence on fossil energy.<br> One important reason for tightening the target is that the committee has grasped an important truth. As temperatures rise, non-linear effects will come into play that will amplify warming, such as methane release from permafrost and oceans. Beyond a threshold level, these runaway warming processes are likely to become uncontrollable, and lead to further irreversible impacts, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheets. \"The world may be able to adapt to small changes in temperature change,\" writes Lord Turner, \"but once higher increases are experienced damages will exceed the adaptive capacity of many biological, physical and social systems.\" Thus, it is essential to steer well clear of a 4C temperature rise, which would lead to \"extreme consequences potentially beyond our ability to adapt\", and \"limit the central expectation of global temperature rise to, or close to, 2C\". Taking into account the larger than anticipated role of greenhouse gases other than CO2 \u2013 such as methane and the HFC gases used as refrigerants \u2013 and the need for the UK as a wealthy and highly polluting country to lead on emissions reductions, the UK's proper share of emissions reductions comes to at least 80%, within a global emissions reduction of 50-60%. My only objection to the committee's interim advice is that while it is making all the right arguments, it does not go far enough. We are already experiencing positive feedbacks in the climate system with our present degree of warming of barely 1C, notably with the Arctic summer ice melt. The idea that a 2C temperature rise is in any way safe is more wishful thinking than science \u2013 for all the reasons set out by Turner about the non-linear climate response to emissions. There is now a growing awareness that we should achieve global emissions neutrality by 2050 \u2013 that is, that all residual greenhouse gas emissions taking place by that date should be balanced by CO2 uptake in soils, forests and oceans.  But the committee's advice has to be welcomed, nonetheless. It spells out the actions we should be taking: the systematic decarbonisation of the entire UK economy, including power generation, transport, heating and industry, with a strong reliance on technological innovation backed by public investment and regulation \u2013 and the urgency of embarking on that path without delay. Gordon Brown has already indicated that he will accept the target, and Ed Miliband has been left with little wiggle-room \u2013 just supposing he wants it. The target must now be made law in the forthcoming Climate Act \u2013 but most importantly, it must be backed up by action. As we know from the government's failure to meet its legally binding target on fuel poverty, to pass a law is one thing, to fulfill the obligation is another. The real challenge is for the future. </p> <p>Ed, for all our sakes, don't flunk it!</p>",
  "<p>Despite undimmed anxiety about the world's economic future, both campaigns focused on their rivals' pasts yesterday after Sarah Palin spent the weekend asking questions about Barack Obama's associations with Bill Ayers. </p> <p>In his most lacerating speech yet, in New Mexico, John McCain sought to portray Obama as an untrustworthy \"Chicago politician\" who had risen without trace. </p> <p>\"I didn't just show up out of nowhere,\" he told the crowd, adding: \"Even at this late hour in the campaign, there are essential things we don't know about Senator Obama or the record that he brings to this campaign.\" </p> <p>He asked a question Palin and Republican TV attack ads have also been repeating: \"Who is the real Barack Obama?\"</p> <p>The Obama campaign shows every sign of having been long prepared for the assault. This morning, it released a 13-minute video delving into McCain's involvement in the Keating Five scandal, part of a multimedia blitz designed to implicate the senator in an earlier financial catastrophe. </p> <p>The exchanges have created a poisonous atmosphere ahead of tonight's debate in Nashville, Tennessee, <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/uselections2008.johnmccain\">Ewen MacAskill writes in today's Guardian</a>. The encounter is one of the last chances for the Republicans to turn around a White House election that appears to be slipping away from them.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Because it is not the first of the presidential debates, and because Sarah Palin is not involved, tonight's debate in Nashville has attracted less advance attention. But it could be crucial. The \"town hall\" format, in which undecided voters will ask questions through the moderator, Tom Brokaw, is where McCain feels most at home; he originally invited Obama to join him for 10 similar events. </p> <p>But the new, negative tone of the race - however much McCain may be to blame for it - could pose problems for him in a one-on-one encounter with Obama, since it clashes with the personal image he has long sought to project. I'll be <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/burkeman\">liveblogging the debate</a>.

A CBS poll, on the other hand, shows the Obama/Biden lead narrowing since last week, from nine points to four, or 47% to 43%. </p> <p>Meanwhile, an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey finds 77% of Americans thinking the country is on the wrong track.

  "<p>The American author of a bestselling critical biography of Barack Obama containing the false allegation he was raised a Muslim has been detained in Kenya.</p> <p>Jerome Corsi, who wrote The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality, is being held at immigration headquarters in Nairobi while his immigration status is checked.</p> <p>Police picked Corsi up from his hotel today because he did not have the temporary work permit needed to conduct business in Kenya, according to Carlos Maluta, a senior immigration official. \"We still haven't decided what to do with him,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama is a popular figure in Kenya, where his father was a government economist. Several of his extended family still live there.</p> <p>In 2004, Corsi was the co-author of Unfit for Command: Swift boat veterans speak out against John Kerry, which was criticised for carrying interviews with people who did not serve in Vietnam with the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate. Many who did said the book's claims were false.</p> <p>The US press has accused Corsi of being anti-Islamic, anti-Catholic, anti-semitic and homophobic, and of exploiting racial prejudices in an attempt to ''scare white America\".</p> <p>Despite this, The Obama Nation and Unfit for Command made it into the New York Times bestseller lists.</p> <p>Corsi writes in The Obama Nation that the presidential candidate is a dangerous and radical prospect to become the leader of the US and makes the false allegations that Obama was raised as a Muslim, and harbours \"black rage\".</p> <p>Obama issued a 40-page rebuttal on his website <a href=\"http://www.fightthesmears.com\">FightTheSmears.com</a>, under the title Unfit for Publication. He asserts that he is a Christian who attended Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago.</p> <p>According to a press release announcing Corsi's visit, he arrived in Kenya last week at the invitation of Christian missionaries concerned about the spread of Islam.

  "<p>I must confess, at the outset, that Dominic Couzens, the author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Top-100-Birding-Sites-World/dp/1847731090\">Top 100 Birding Sites of the World</a>, is a good friend of mine. He is also, in the friendliest of ways, a rival \u2013 we both write about birds and wildlife. </p> <p>I like to think we share a particular view about birding \u2013 that although it is wonderful to jet around the world enjoying exotic places and birds, there's no place like home. Birding on your local patch \u2013 even in your garden \u2013 is for us the essence of daily life.</p> <p>But now Dominic has revealed a guilty secret \u2013 one which I admit lurks in even the most dedicated local patch enthusiast. He longs to leave his Dorset home, and for a short time at least, his lovely family, and head to the world's most far-flung birding sites. <br><br>From the <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html?action=SitHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=2327&amp;m=\" 0\" \">Camargue</a> and <a href=\"http://www.andalucia.com/environment/protect/donana.htm\">Coto Do\u00f1ana</a> in Europe to <a href=\"http://www.indiawildlifeportal.com/bharatpur-bird-sanctuary/birds-in-bharatpur.html\">Bharatpur</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.hk/eng/maipo/wildlife/birds/\">Mai Po</a> in Asia; the <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html?action=SitHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=6288&amp;m=\" 0\" \">Bale Mountains</a> in Ethiopia to <a href=\"http://gorp.away.com/gorp/location/latamer/peru/manubio.htm\">Manu</a> in Peru, and some really remote locations, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_Birds_of_New_Caledonia\">New Caledonia</a> and <a href=\"http://neseabirds.com/Antarctica/ant996.htm\">South Georgia</a>, this book contains a mouth-watering century of great places to go to watch birds, written in an informative and very readable style. </p> <p>Like every keen birder who picks up this book, I did what I always do when confronted with a 'top 100' \u2013 I worked out how many sites I had visited myself. Fourteen doesn't seem all that many, especially given that some, like <a href=\"http://www.birdsofbritain.co.uk/reserves/norfolk.asp\">north Norfolk</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.fatbirder.com/links_geo/europe/scotland_western_isles.html\">Outer Hebrides</a>, are pretty close to home. But when I started reminiscing about days I had spent in these wonderful locations, my mood changed.</p> <p>Outside Britain, one of the first top 100 locations I ever visited was the <a href=\"http://www.andalucia.com/environment/protect/donana.htm\">Coto Do\u00f1ana</a> in southern Spain. I was filming a Spanish-language series for the BBC, and was privileged to be accompanied by Tono Valverde, who had been on the pioneering expeditions here back in the 1950s. Sadly this wonderful place, once described as \"Europe's largest wilderness\" had gone the way of so many other wetlands, and been drained for agriculture and development. </p> <p>The same applies to <a href=\"http://www.eilatbirdsfestival.com/\">Eilat</a> in Israel, a migration hotspot which has undergone heavy tourist development. <a href=\"http://www.birdtours.co.uk/tripreports/brazil/braz2/Iguazu2001.htm\">Iguassu Falls</a> on the Argentina/Brazil border, and <a href=\"http://www.birdcapemay.org/\">Cape May</a> in New Jersey, have fared better, managing to integrate tourism (much of it of the eco variety) with the environment.</p> <p>Others, such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belovezhskaya_Pushcha\">Bialowieza forest</a> in south-east Poland, remain virtually unchanged over centuries \u2013 this enchanted forest is home to nine species of woodpecker and a host of other woodland birds, though they are fiendishly hard to find amongst the thick foliage. </p> <p>Of all the sites I have visited, the most intensely concentrated birding experience of all is from the balcony at the <a href=\"http://www.asawright.org/\">Asa Wright centre</a> in Trinidad \u2013 once described by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/who/bill_oddie.shtml\">Bill Oddie</a> as \"arguably the best place to watch birds in the world\".<br> <br>So what makes a top birding site? Non-birders might consider spectacular scenery to be a high priority \u2013 but a birder enjoying a visit to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_Sewage_Farm\">Werribee Sewage Farm</a> near Melbourne, featured in Sean Dooley's excellent book <a href=\"http://www.thebigtwitch.com/\">the Big Twitch</a> would probably disagree. Number of species would certainly justify the inclusion of <a href=\"http://gorp.away.com/gorp/location/latamer/peru/manubio.htm\">Manu</a>, where almost 1,000 different kinds of bird have been recorded. </p> <p>But what about <a href=\"http://neseabirds.com/Antarctica/ant996.htm?\">South Georgia</a>. This sub-Antarctic island boasts fewer breeding species than my Somerset garden \u2013 but with literally tens of millions of individual birds, including millions of penguins, it certainly justifies its place in the book.</p> <p>Accessibility is also important: I shall probably never visit Bhutan or Colombia, but chances are that one day I shall pass through Hong Kong, and spend a day watching waders at the legendary <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.hk/eng/maipo/wildlife/birds/ marshes\">Mai Po</a>. </p> <p>One of my favourite birding experiences ever was at <a href=\"http://www.birdtours.co.uk/tripreports/argentina/arg6/CostaneraSur2000.htm\">Costanera Sur</a> in the heart of Buenos Aires, where an early morning outing brought me more than 50 'lifers' before I had to catch a plane back home. For business travellers, <a href=\"http://www.nhbs.com/title.php?tefno=141721\">Where to Watch Birds in World Cities</a> by Paul Milne is a useful and practical companion to the \"trips of a lifetime\" outlined in Dominic Couzens' book.</p> <p>But I can still dream \u2013 and of all the 86 sites I haven't yet visited, three stand out as truly special: the aforementioned <a href=\"http://gorp.away.com/gorp/location/latamer/peru/manubio.htm\">Manu</a> and <a href=\"http://neseabirds.com/Antarctica/ant996.htm\">South Georgia</a> \u2013 surely the two most contrasting birding sites on the planet \u2013 and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantanal\">Pantanal</a> in the lowlands of Brazil. </p> <p>With a wealth of waterbirds, and the magnificent (and highly endangered) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinthine_macaw\">Hyacinth Macaw</a> this really would be my dream destination\u2026 In the meantime, as autumn winds blow over the Somerset Levels, I'll just have to make do with the birds in my garden!</p> <p>So where have you been that you consider a top birding destination?

  "<p>From supermarkets and oil companies to individuals, nations and continents, people are talking about reducing their carbon footprints. Statistics, targets and goals abound. But what do the aims such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">80% cut by 2050 suggested in Britain's climate watchdog</a>? How does your country's pledge measure up? And just how many parts per million carbon dioxide are too many?</p> <p>Here, we explain how such climate goals are set, and why they may not be enough.<br><strong><br>Carbon levels</strong></p> <p>The level of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is measured in parts per million (ppm) in a given volume of air. The figure was about 280ppm before the industrial revolution and has been creeping up since. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/13/carbonemissions.climatechange\">latest reading was 387ppm</a>, and the figure is rising at about 2ppm each year as emissions continue unabated.</p> <p>But carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas: methane, nitrous oxide and numerous others also trap heat as they accumulate in the atmosphere, and must be included in calculations. To do this, scientists group them together, work out how much heat they trap, and calculate the amount of carbon dioxide that would be needed to cause a similar effect. The two figures are then added together, and called carbon dioxide equivalent - CO2[e].</p> <p>The extra load from the other greenhouse gases bumps up the pure carbon dioxide concentration by up to a fifth. So, roughly, 400ppm CO2 = 450ppm CO2[e] and 550ppm CO2 = 650ppm CO2[e]. </p> <p>In predicting the likely temperature rise under a given emissions scenario, the all-inclusive CO2[e] figure is the important one, though this is not always made clear.<br><strong><br>Stabilisation goals</strong></p> <p>In 1996, the European Union said the world should limit the global temperature rise to 2C above preindustrial levels, and that this meant limiting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to 550ppm CO2[e]. In reality, the relationship between carbon dioxide levels and eventual temperature rise is less precise. Scientists now talk only about likely ranges. The <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/Independent_Reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">2006 Stern Review</a> said that 550ppm CO2[e] would drive temperatures up by between 1.5 and 4.5C, with a median rise of 3C. It said the world should aim for a stabilisation goal of between 450 and 550ppm CO2[e].</p> <p>The lower end of that range (450ppm CO2[e]) is now commonly associated with a 2C rise, and the upper end (550ppm CO2[e]) with a 3C rise. In fact, scientists say that at 450ppm CO2[e] there is still a 50% chance that the 2C target will be exceeded.</p> <p>Jim Hansen, Nasa's top climate scientist, says that even a 2C rise may not avoid dangerous large scale impacts such as melting of ice sheets, and says world CO2 should not be allowed to remain above 350ppm CO2, significantly below its current level \u2013 that means removing CO2 from the atmosphere and burying it.<br><strong><br>Targets and timetables</strong></p> <p>The world has not yet set a global goal to limit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but 450ppm CO2[e] is often used as an example. In 2007, the G8 group of nations converted this target to a 50% cut in world emissions by 2050. As any new climate deal is likely to permit developing countries to continue increasing their emissions for the foreseeable future, the bulk of this burden will fall on rich countries such as the US and Britain. Britain's share of the load could be as much as a 95% cut of national emissions by 2050.</p> <p>In anticipation of such a demand on them, several countries including Britain have unilaterally pledged to cut their emissions. Several have also set interim targets, such as the EU's pledge to reduce emissions 20% by 2020, rising to 30% if enough countries follow its lead. Cities, companies and states have also set targets. Here is a selection:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-334713552\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/06/09/carbontargets3.jpg\" alt=\"Carbon targets\" width=\"460\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Moving the goalposts?</strong></p> <p>Some scientists have criticised climate targets as based on \"anecdotal rather than systematic\" information. Others point out that they can fail to include all sources of emissions. Britain's original climate change bill, for example, failed to include pollution from aviation and shipping, though its climate watchdog now recommends they are included. </p> <p>David King, former chief scientific adviser to the government, has said it is critical that official targets are \"seen to be achievable\". This has led to a stand-off between both campaigners and scientists who complain that domestic targets are not ambitious enough, and politicians who fear setting unrealistic goals. Some scientists are even saying that the G8's global goal of 50% reductions by 2050 - already very difficult to achieve - is not enough. </p> <p>In May, experts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the G8 goal \"will not avoid global impacts\". They said the target should be tightened to a 80% cut in world emissions by 2050.</p> <p>Many observers believe radical political leadership is essential if such severe cuts are to be achieved, with the summit taking place in Copenhagen in December 2009 seen as a pivotal moment. The scale of the task was highlighted this month by the UK Met Office, which warned that global <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/01/climatechange.carbonemissions1\">greenhouse gas emissions would have to start falling by 3% from 2010</a> to stand a chance of limiting warming to 2C. Global emissions are currently rising.</p>"
