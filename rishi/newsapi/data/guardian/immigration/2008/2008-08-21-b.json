  "<p>Children who spend a long time at the Yarl's Wood detention centre are being emotionally damaged, an official report published today has concluded.</p> <p>The report, by the prisons inspector, Anne Owers, raised \"serious concerns\" about the lack of specialist healthcare for youngsters at the detention centre for immigrants.</p> <p>It criticised the management for wrongly detaining disabled children and keeping inaccurate records.</p> <p>Yarl's Wood, near Bedford, came to national attention when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/aug/16/immigrationandpublicservices.immigration1\">detainees rioted</a> and burned down part of the complex soon after it opened in 2002.</p> <p>Although Owers' report said Yarl's Wood was performing \"reasonably well in many areas\", it said the \"plight of detained children remained of great concern\".</p> <p>\"While child welfare services had improved, an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated,\" she wrote. </p> <p>\"Any period of detention can be detrimental to children and their families, but the impact of lengthy detention is particularly extreme.\"</p> <p>At the time of the inspection, there were 56 detainees under the age of 16 at Yarl's Wood.</p> <p>The average stay for a child \"if the centre's figures were to be trusted\" increased from eight to 15 days. </p> <p>However, inspectors were told confidentially that some children detained for a cumulative period of 275 days were later said to have been there for only 14 and 17 days.</p> <p>Interviews with parents revealed that many believed their children's condition had deteriorated soon after their arrival at Yarl's Wood.</p> <p>Youngsters who otherwise had been described as coping well in the outside community were reported to have had difficulty eating and sleeping, become withdrawn and shown other symptoms such as bed wetting. </p> <p>Nearly all children said they had felt scared, upset or worried on arrival at the centre, \"which was not surprising given the sometimes traumatic circumstances in which many had initially been detained\". </p> <p>Teachers working at Yarl's Wood also reported cases of children withdrawing or appearing depressed and becoming rebellious and unreasonable following admission</p> <p>Health services for youngsters were also criticised, with the report finding that \"there were no specialist health services for children\". </p> <p>There was no registered sick children's nurse, although the post was being advertised. Mental health services for children were not easily accessible, and there was no children's counsellor. </p> <p>\"We found examples in the recent past of children with disabilities who ought not to have been detained,\" the report said. </p> <p>However, the document praised staff for the low rates of self-harm and bullying, the provision of faith services and the proportionate use of force.<br> \"Yarl's Wood is to be congratulated on sustaining reasonable performance in many areas, despite the upheavals of the change of management and reduction in staff numbers,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>As the new Oasis album appears on the horizon, fluffing up its manky collar and perfecting its pout, here's a question: are arrogant stadium bands finally losing their power? This may be a vain hope rather than a query, I grant you, especially as it comes from the gob of a desperate woman. Still, after the Arctic Monkeys first brought cleverness and charm to the gargantuan venue and the Glastonbury headline spot, I do think something has changed. We now want more from our biggest indie bands - and that means nous and intelligence thrown in with those power chords.</p> <p>I say this two weeks after getting the debut album by Glasvegas. Before I heard it, I wasn't hopeful. Glasvegas had been discovered, like Oasis, by Alan McGee, playing third on the bill at Glasgow's King Tut's Wah Wah Hut. Their early demos sounded ragged and shonky. Their name was bloody awful. But then I put on the album and suddenly, gloriously, everything clicked into place. Oasis and Glasvegas are light years apart.</p> <p>This wonderful album, more than any other, sets the charms of the noughties against the chops of the 90s. For starters: music has been much more about atmospheres that attitudes in the last couple of years. Take the shoegazing revival, the resurgence of blissful dance music, and the emergence of dubstep. Glasvegas have seen this wave coming, and let it wash generously over them. The Gallaghers still think they walk on water, drowning their opposition with their tired guitars. One burst of the damp, two-chord opening of their new single, The Shock of the Lightning, shows how far they have sunk.</p> <p>This decade's best indie bands also write rich, human narratives. Remember when Alex Turner came along with his tight, tender tales of Mardy Bums, sex workers and scummy men, and how different they seemed to the post-Oasis torrents of bland, cocky guff. Glasvegas may have a rougher vocabulary, but they also write without cliche about broken families and cheating lovers, and add twists to their tales.</p> <p>Take their song Go Square Go, a tale of fighting schoolboys that sounds bolshily like the Gallaghers until its last, sinister verse. \"My dad told me not to come home/ If I don't kill this bastard/ My dad is right .../ Win, lose or draw the fight/ This bullying has got to stop tonight.\" Next to the Oasis single, these lyrics read much more like the end of an episode of The Wire than a glut of empty slogans about love being a time machine on a silver screen.</p> <p>Glasvegas also reference the past tenderly, cleverly and without machismo. They often nod towards 1960s girl groups, whose songs teetered on the edge of lost innocence. Take the spoken word poem Stabbed, which, just like the Shangri-Las' heartbreaking track about sexual assault, Past Present and Future, is set to a passage from Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Take the moments when James Allan sings, without irony, about a child waiting for an ice-cream van to come, or ends a song about a dead son with a verse from You Are My Sunshine. Listen to Liam singing his latest round of Beatles-referencing nonsense about a \"magical mystery\" soon after, and it's clear who packs more punch.</p> <p>I could go on for ever. Glasvegas sing about guilt and loneliness, feelings Liam and Noel wouldn't know if they bit them on their rumps. They sing about people coming together, but they mention \"active citizenship\", and avoiding \"sectarianism and hurtful racist ways\" instead of peddling platitudes. They also - and this is by the by, but I like it - have a great female drummer.</p> <p>But let's be fair to Oasis for a nanosecond. When they emerged, their balls, chops, and nonsense poetry was fun for a while, especially after the miserable sludge of navel-gazing grunge. But after they got rich, their tales of escape became bloated and boring. So when I hear the Glasvegas song, It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry, and the lyrics, \"Sincerity's bottom on my list/ What's the story, morning glory?/ I feel so low and worthless\", I don't hear a homage, but a critique. I also hear the Gallaghers' ears burning, their arrogance waning, and a new era beginning.</p>",
  "<p>Entering the Water Cube, as Tom Daley will do again today, feels like walking into a giant Fox's Glacier Mint. It is not just the ice-blue colour, but also the sense of being sealed inside like the polar bear in the adverts. In Daley's case there is the added pressure of being a 14-year-old who cracked very publicly at the venue last week. It is a huge burden for someone still awaiting his individual Games debut.</p> <p>So if the young man feels rather trapped as he awaits his first dive in the men's 10-metre platform preliminaries it should come as no great surprise. No one would ever describe the Olympics as an easy environment, particularly not for a visiting diver in China and even less so if you happen to be Britain's youngest male participant since 1960. The much-discussed spat with his diving partner Blake Aldridge during the synchronised competition has, if nothing else, blown an awful lot of romance out of the water.</p> <p>Given the unpromising backdrop, we are about to discover much about Daley's strength of character. Aldridge's brutal verdict, after Daley had rebuked him for speaking to his mother on the phone before the pair's final dive, was that the teenager had been \"over-nervous\" in the team event and had performed ordinarily as a result. Regardless of the dubious etiquette of criticising a team-mate in public, it was pretty obvious the occasion got to the young prodigy from Plymouth. If it happens again, the uncomfortable question of whether too much has been expected too young will resurface.</p> <p>Given that Daley is the current European 10m platform champion, however, a premature exit should not happen under normal circumstances. It is also worth remembering that Chen Ruolin and Wang Xin, winners of the women's 10m synchronised diving last week, were aged 15 and 16 respectively. Chen's antidote to nerves, apparently, is watching Tom and Jerry cartoons and her performances would seem to indicate they do the trick. </p> <p>The onus, either way, is on Daley to deliver or slink back to school to think again. Publicly, at least, he is confident. \"I have got a few cobwebs out of the way now and I'm not as nervous,\" he admitted. \"Now I know what the Olympic Games is going to feel like I can compete like [in]a normal competition. I will go into the individual and try to make up for what I did in the synchronised event. </p> <p>\"It was disappointing but I'm going to go out into the individual full of confidence and try to have as much fun as possible. I won't do anything differently in terms of preparation.\"</p> <p>Whatever happens, his medal prospects look remote with the Chinese set to dominate. Germany's Sascha Klein, pipped by Daley in the European championships in March, has a point to make and Britain's other participant, Peter Waterfield, will be seeking to outdo him too. </p> <p>It is the steepest of learning curves for Daley and Steve Foley, British diving's performance director, can only hope the experience does not stunt the development of one of Britain's brightest prospects for 2012. That still appears unlikely, for Daley is not short of self-confidence and continues to resemble a modern-day version of Mowgli skipping through the Jungle Book. Maybe the man-cub should follow the advice of Baloo the Bear and just try to forget about his worries.</p>",
  "<p>London 2012's difficulties in keeping its sponsors happy have been exposed by a sponsorship row between Visa and the BBC. Visa is the corporate backer of the Olympic handover party in The Mall on Sunday, which is the centrepiece of the capital's post-Beijing celebrations. But London's Olympic organising committee has had to mediate in a dispute between its own sponsors and the BBC, which has refused to budge over its editorial guidelines on product visibility.</p> <p>A compromise has only recently been reached after the BBC demanded the credit-card company tone down how much promotional material it would be permitted on the concert stage on The Mall on Sunday. \"We must avoid any undue prominence or giving the impression that we are promoting or endorsing products, organisations or services,\" say the BBC's guidelines. \"We must take care to minimise product references in output designed to appeal to children and ensure references to trade names, brand names and slogans are clearly editorially justified.\" Visa was told it would have to be satisfied with a corporate logo on fixed screens out of the BBC's main shot and on the top canopy of the stage. Perimeter fencing will also carry the logo but it is understood the company has given most ground to reach a compromise. </p> <p>It is a problem all London 2012's partners will face in future events broadcast by the BBC. A spokeswoman for London 2012 said: \"Everyone is happy with the outcome.\"<br><strong><br>How is London 'compact'?</strong></p> <p>London 2012's claim that it will put on an enviably \"compact\" Olympics does not pass much muster with the IOC. Gilbert Felli, who as the IOC's executive director is in charge of coordinating the delivery of Games for the Lausanne HQ, said: \"How can you say London is the most compact? Everything is here in Beijing, for London the sailing is hours away in Weymouth. Lots of events are away from the city.\"</p> <p><strong>Americas in the frame</strong></p> <p>The IOC is considering delaying the US tender for the rights to broadcast the 2016 Summer and 2018 Winter Games until after the decision of where the 2016 Games will take place. The news enhances the chances that either Chicago or Rio de Janeiro will be the host city in 2016. NBC became the Olympic movement's biggest commercial backer when it paid around \u00a31bn in 2003 to broadcast the Turin 2010 and London 2012 Games. But the decision to award the Olympics back to Europe eight years after being in Athens had not been taken and it is expected to hit US viewing figures in four years. The US remains the IOC's most important television market and the only way it can maximise revenue there will be to return the Games to US time zones.</p> <p>The NBC deal runs out after London and there is certain to be intense interest in the broadcast from Fox and ABC/ESPN, who came close in the last bidding process. When asked if NBC had held any dialogue with the IOC to apply pressure for an Olympics in the Americas, a spokesman did not deny it, saying instead: \"Not that I would wish to comment on.\"<br><strong><br>Pele plugs Rio</strong></p> <p>Despite Rio's and Chicago's status as favourites in the race to host 2016, a decision that will be taken in Copenhagen in the autumn of 2009, the Olympic movement's biggest grandee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, has been lobbying hard here for Madrid. As the big hitter rolled out by the Spanish capital, the octogenarian is up against Pele, who was yesterday announced as the ambassador for Rio, and the Illinois-born Barack Obama, who will schmooze for Chicago once he has satisfied his more pressing concerns.<br><strong><br>Boris nonplussed</strong></p> <p>The impression that the government's Medal Hopes athlete-funding plan was written on the back of a cigarette packet are growing by the day. One strand of the proposal is to offer post-Games naming rights to the Olympic venues. But the body in charge of the legacy for the sporting facilities is the mayor of London's London Development Agency. So this column asked Boris Johnson what input he had had on the plans and, judging by his response, the answer is \"zero\". He looked even more nonplussed than usual.</p>",
  "<p>Gary Glitter was last night finally onboard a flight heading for the UK, having spent three days in international limbo after being barred from Thailand and Hong Kong. The disgraced 64-year-old rock star had been due back in Britain this week after his release from a Vietnamese jail, where he served two years and nine months of a three-year sentence for child abuse. </p> <p>Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd flew from Vietnam to Thailand on Tuesday, but efforts to return him to the UK descended into farce when he failed to board a connecting flight from Bangkok to Heathrow, saying he was too ill to travel. He was barred from entering Thailand and told he would be taken to a detention centre if he refused to leave the country. </p> <p>After spending more than 20 hours in the transit lounge at Bangkok airport, he flew to Hong Kong on Wednesday, only to be denied entry there and flown back to Thailand. Yesterday afternoon Phongdej Chaiprawat, a Thai police general, said Gadd had agreed to leave the country. </p> <p>Last night a Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that Gadd had left Bangkok and was heading to the UK. He was due to arrive at Heathrow shortly after seven o'clock this morning, to be met by police and served with an order placing him on the sex offenders' register. </p> <p>The chief of Thailand's immigration police, Lieutenant General Chatchawal Suksomchit, said Gadd was denied entry because under Thai laws those convicted of child sex abuse in a foreign country could be barred. Another officer, Colonel Worawat Amornwiwat, urged Thai Airways to ensure he went back to England. \"There is no choice for him now.\" </p> <p>Gadd was convicted of downloading child pornography in the UK in 1999 after a computer repair shop found thousands of images on his laptop. He served two months of a four-month sentence. He moved to Spain and Cuba then south-east Asia where he escaped detection until found by reporters. He was expelled from Cambodia after allegations of sex crimes, and moved to Vung Tau, in Vietnam. </p> <p>Two Vietnamese girls at first made allegations of rape against him - a charge which could mean a death sentence if convicted- but Gadd stood trial accused of obscene acts with children. He pleaded not guilty, but was convicted and sentenced to three years in March 2006. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, has now announced tighter controls on the movement abroad of paedophiles.</p> <p>Zoe Hilton, an NSPCC policy adviser, said: \"This clearly illustrates why it's so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another. This case is important because it highlights how easy it is for UK offenders to move around freely when overseas.\"</p>",
  "<p>Within hours of the news breaking of the ambush of French soldiers on Monday, text messages arrived on reporters' mobile phones in Kabul. From Zahibullah Mujahed, a Taliban spokesman, they boasted of the defeat of the \"invader forces\". Nato spokesmen in the city took much longer to issue a statement.</p> <p>One problem, they said, was the difficulty in identifying exactly who had attacked the French troops. Most reports, including the statements by Mujahed, described the attackers as Taliban.</p> <p>In fact they were probably fighters from the Hezb-i-Islami group led by veteran Islamist warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, for whom the plateaux and gorges around the scruffy town of Sorobi have been a stronghold since the Soviet occupation.</p> <p>The confusion over the identity of those responsible for the biggest loss of Nato soldiers in a single incident in Afghanistan since 2005 mirrors wider uncertainty about the identity of the shadowy enemy being fought in this country.</p> <p>Analysts from the 40-nation, US-led coalition are realising that the insurgency is much more complicated than they had thought. Hundreds, if not thousands of groups are ranged into a complex and shifting pattern of alliances of interest. Groups fight the coalition, and contest each other's authority and influence. Their nature also varies enormously.</p> <p>\"It is probably better to talk about insurgencies than an insurgency,\" said one specialist with the United Nations in Kabul. \"Some of these groups are just six guys and they hate the six guys from the next village.\"</p> <p>Local people have long been aware of this. At a community level, the names of local Taliban commanders are well known and few are unaware of the complex local power struggles that led one minor warlord to fight while another stays neutral or sides with the government.</p> <p>Degrees of ideological commitment differ. Interviews conducted through intermediaries with the Taliban reveal that older commanders, many of whom fought the Soviets, often see the current situation as the latest phase in a long and chaotic power struggle. But a younger generation is more influenced by the jihadi or takfiri hardline ideology closer to that of al-Qaida and see their struggle as part of a global war against the west.</p> <p>Overlaying this web of allegiances, calculation of interest, and ideological and generational difference are lines of loyalty to men such as Hekmatyar in the north-east, the clan of veteran warlord Jalalauddin Haqqani in the east and to the core of the Taliban who seized power in 1996 and are now based in Pakistan.</p> <p>Even the last are by no means united. Western and Afghan intelligence sources in Kabul describe feuds and disputes over strategy and ideology among the Taliban higher command. There are fierce arguments over the justification of suicide bombing or attacks on aid workers. One commander, interviewed indirectly, said he condemned killing Afghans. Another justified the deaths of \"hypocrite collaborators\".</p> <p>A further complicating factor is the involvement of criminals and teenage gangs. In some instances, Taliban senior commanders offer money for successful attacks on coalition or government forces.</p> <p>\"It is very organised. You send someone to Quetta [the western Pakistan city] to find out what is needed, you agree a price, you attack the convoy or police station or blow up the bridge or whatever. They send someone to verify the damage and then they pay you,\" said Roshanak Wardak, a member of parliament.</p> <p>The Taliban have succeeded in giving an impression of unity - an important psychological advantage. One recent post on their website revealed a neat organogramme of their organisation, with relevant committees for media and military operations, care of the families of \"martyrs\", fatwas and external relations. And their media machine works. </p> <p>\"They are extremely good at communication,\" said Mohammed Masoom Stanikzai, an adviser to President Karzai and vice-chairman of Afghanistan's reconciliation committee, set up to win over wavering Taliban fighters. \"When they make promises, they deliver.\" The value of spectacular attacks, such as those earlier this year which liberated hundreds of detainees from Kandahar prison or on the Serena luxury hotel in Kabul, is also well understood.</p> <p>Two key questions are how linked the insurgents are to the drugs trade and to what extent the Taliban are composed of \"foreigners\". </p> <p>Again, the situation differs across the country. In the southern Helmand and Kandahar provinces, where the most opium is grown, there are strong informal links between militants, corrupt officials and drug traffickers. \"They all have a common interest in disorder,' said Christina Oguz, Kabul representative of the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime. Often the Taliban levy on opium the traditional 10% tax on agricultural products. In the east, the link with narcotics is more tenuous.</p> <p>In the south, too, the proportion of \"foreigners\" is higher. Many fighters flow in from Pakistan, some even from the eastern Punjab province, which does not share the Pashtun ethnicity of the bulk of Afghan Taliban fighters. One 22-year-old from the eastern Pakistan town of Bahawalpur interviewed in Afghan detention, said last week he had been groomed for a suicide attack in a religious school across the border before being captured.</p> <p>There are also indications that the significant numbers of Afghan battlefield commanders killed by coalition forces are being replaced by Pakistanis, who appear more extreme, though the lower ranks and the high command remain predominantly Afghan.</p> <p>Thrown into this explosive mixture too is al-Qaida which fulfils, according to several intelligence sources in Kabul, a \"facilitating, logistics, advisory\" role to certain groups including the main leadership of the Taliban. Freelance militants are arriving in Afghanistan from elsewhere in the Islamic world, even Iraq, the sources say.</p> <p>One key lesson learned by the insurgents is that a tactical defeat can be turned into a strategic victory if it is followed up by more attacks and a clever media strategy.</p> <p>\"The more martyrs we have and the more we attack over the bodies of our martyrs the more we will be feared,\" said one Taliban commander.</p>",
  "<p>Further to your report on Gary Glitter's release from jail in Vietnam (Glitter evades deportation by refusing to board flight - UK police escort admits he has no legal jurisdiction, August 20), we welcome the Home Office's announcement of new measures to monitor British sex offenders who commit crimes abroad. However, we remain concerned that the government continues to be committed to a range of policies which will place the children it seeks to protect at further risk. Despite successive reports by international NGOs highlighting the risks of trafficking and abuse to children seeking asylum alone, the Home Office intends to forcibly return child asylum seekers - some as young as 12 - to countries including Vietnam, where Britain's child protection policies cannot keep them safe. We urge the home secretary to rethink this strategy and put children's safety first.<br><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong><br>Policy adviser, young refugees, Children's Society</p>",
  "<p>Whatever happened to the heroes? The past 20 years have seen a large-scale disappearance of the kind of stars Simon Reynolds once hailed \"freaks, aliens and mad prophets\": the likes of Kevin Rowland, Adam Ant, Gary Numan. In their place we have professional outsiders (plenty of American acts from grunge onwards, British post-punk revivalists by the truckload) and more calculatingly quirky types (Alison Goldfrapp, Arcade Fire). None of these count as cult artists - although they do have rabid followings - because their moves seem so deliberate. Nick Cave's facial hair strikes a similar tone of \"I'm weird, me\", and the same has been true for a raft of serious songwriters from Bonnie Prince Billy to the Beta Band. But Gary Numan's cyber-baldie geek figure - and his unstoppable gob, telling the world every detail of his crumbly life simultaneously shattering and reinforcing his public image - seems like the kind of pop star we're unlikely to see again. No wonder he had an army of Numanoids at his disposal.</p> <p>The alchemy that creates a cult hero is almost lost. With everyone's past and present open to instant scrutiny on the web, it's harder than ever to keep the mystery caged. Out there on the fringes, it's still possible; Bon Iver spent a year in a shed in the middle of Montana and has stirred up something approaching hero status. This touches on the romantic in pop, the genuine outsider, swimming against the tide, and a legend stretching back to Thomas Chatterton, the English Romantic poet who died of arsenic poisoning aged 17. According to Jon Savage's Teenage, Chatterton's story \"sealed the Romantic view of youth as beset by storms and stresses, so much so that premature death - by suicide or accident - was symptomatic.\"</p> <p>Chatterton was commemorated by Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Keats, who \"celebrated him as a misunderstood genius whose youth, made permanent by death, would never fade\". With his pre-Raphaelite locks, whispering vocals, and velvet jacket, Nick Drake was pop's Chatterton, a true doomed Romantic, and his early death created a mythic figure who has since fizzed out of all proportion to his impact on the early 70s rock scene. It has been a gradual process: first, the Dream Academy credited their mid-80s hit Life in a Northern Town to his influence (even though Drake grew up in a Midlands village); in the 1990s, his original records started selling for hundreds of pounds, and a biography appeared. Now, he is as big an oldie as Mr Tambourine Man, his music is heard on BBC trailers, and Brad Pitt - to clinch Drake's Hollywood Babylon status - narrated his brief life story on Radio 2.</p> <p>Some element of tragedy - as with gay icons, though the rockist elite would loathe to admit as much - is key to cult status, and an early death means you never grow ugly. \"Who is the king shag corpse?\" wondered Mark E Smith in 1981. Most likely he had the cult of Ian Curtis on his mind, which, retrospectively, was tiny compared to the Joy Division subculture of 2008, but still big enough to have engulfed the Manchester music scene in greyness until the rise of the Smiths and the Hacienda.</p> <p>Robert Johnson and Hank Williams are still held up by some as the twin bolts of lightning that created rock'n'roll, though only one of them had a song turned into an advert for electrical kitchen appliances: Williams' \"Hey good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?\" was rather more ITV-friendly than \"Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go\", or Dead Shrimp Blues, for that matter. Williams was also popular enough to be among the very first acts to have a 45 released in the UK, I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive being just the 16th release on the MGM label in March 1953. Unfortunately, he had died a couple of months before, making this the first single released as a \"tribute\" to a deceased star.</p> <p>Johnson also unwittingly scored a first, as he died at the mythical age of 27, thus founding what Kurt Cobain's mother referred to as the \"stupid club\" (Jimi, Jim, Janis, Brian and Kurt all signed up later). Johnson is also a perfect example of how someone's legend can distort with history. In 2004, Robert Plant raised a toast on American radio show Fresh Air to \"Robert Johnson, to whom we all owed our existence, in some way.\" Yet during his life, Johnson didn't play many of the dark compositions like Hellhound On My Trail that created his burning myth, but instead played crowd-pleasing hits of the day; he had to earn his cheque, after all. Similarly, the lyric to Cross Road Blues, which Eric Clapton and other myth-builders have claimed is about Johnson selling his soul to the devil in exchange for becoming a blues master (\"Standin' at the crossroads, tried to flag a ride\") sounds to the untrained ear rather more like he's got a flat tyre.</p> <p>Myth is all-important in building up cult status. Why print the truth if the legend is so much more interesting? After all, this is pop music, not the origins of the second world war. The folk world has more than its fair share of cult figures, none greater in recent years than Vashti Bunyan. In 1968, she undertook an expedition from London to the Outer Hebrides by horse and cart. It took her two years and, mid-journey, Joe Boyd convinced her to record a bunch of songs she had written about the experience. Eventually released in 1970, by which time its Aquarian dream and nursery simplicity was out of favour, Just Another Diamond Day sank like a stone. I heard the album in the late 90s and became so obsessed with its innocent beauty that I took a holiday in the Scottish highlands and called up every Bunyan in the phone book, with no joy. Of course, why would this woodland spirit have a telephone?</p> <p>I'd been back from Scotland for about a month when an A&amp;R man at Sanctuary told me he'd been emailed a few times by this Vanished Bunton woman who wanted to reissue her album. He wondered if I'd heard of her. A click of the mouse later, and the legend was revealed: Ms Bunyan lived in the very lovely New Town part of Edinburgh with all mod cons, and - impressively - the rights to her catalogue, which her lawyer partner had helped her to reclaim. Not long after, Just Another Diamond Day was doing good business, outstripping its original sales 20- or 30-fold, and the title track was in an Orange ad. All wonderful for Vashti Bunyan, of course, but her ultra-obscurity was now somewhat diminished.</p> <p>It's essential to keep the mystery caged. Bunyan, mercifully, was still very much alive to appreciate her Indian summer, but Judee Sill was not. She ticks just about every box for a cult hero - sensitive lyrics, singular vision, deviance, a druggie, and she died too young. She looked like a librarian, but had spent time inside for holding up grocery stores, and turned to prostitution to feed her drug habit before she made her first record - on David Geffen's Asylum label - in 1971. It was a a curious blend of Joni Mitchell, religious imagery (Jesus Was a Crossmaker), and country. \"I'm mostly influenced by Pythagoras, Bach and Ray Charles, in that order,\" she told NME. Clips on YouTube show a mousy, disinterested-looking girl in trademark round specs, performing The Kiss, a song in which all of her visions flow together and transcend the singer-songwriter pallet. We don't know much more about her. By the time she died of a heroin overdose, Sill had apparently broken her back twice, she had a pet slow loris, and she had taken a series of female lovers \"to clean my house\". Pure cinema. Sill even had a stereotypical evil stepfather, an animator who allegedly abused her, then tortured other kids by creating the dreadful 1960s Tom and Jerry cartoons.</p> <p>Graham Bond could have walked straight off a Chuck Jones canvas. The bearded, bear-like organist formed his jazz-blues Organization after splitting from Alexis Korner. Other key names to pass through Bond's band were Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and John McLaughlin. \"There is no star and everybody is indispensable,\" Bond told Melody Maker, who described his music as \"loud, hypnotic and neurotic\". Beyond his influence on the blues scene, Bond became obsessed with tarot cards and Aleister Crowley, leading to albums such as Love Is the Law and We Put Our Magick in You. Like all the best cult acts, he makes Zelig-like appearances in That'll Be the Day, with David Essex and Keith Moon, and Joanna Lumley's Swinging London abomination, The Breaking of Bumbo. In and out of prison and psychiatric hospitals during the early 1970s, Bond threw himself under a tube train at Finsbury Park in 1974.</p> <p>Unsubstantiated rumours and unlogged spells in institutions are a thing of the past in an era of microchipped accuracy; with underground legends of the acid rock era - Syd Barrett, Skip Spence, Arthur Lee, Roky Erickson - they are a common occurence. Shindig magazine recently stuck its neck out and plumped for one act as \"the greatest cult band of all time\": the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band. Their story defies belief and shifts constantly, taking in all of the classic ingredients before skewing it with musical weirdness, perversion, and a smattering of fabulous, truly psychedelic records. Writer Tim Forster has described the WCPAEB story as a \"fairytale in reverse\".</p> <p>Originally a teen trio of Michael Lloyd and the Harris brothers, Dan and Shaun, they were augmented by an older, wealthy huckster called Bob Markley, who gave them their unwieldy name. (Is it a joke? Is it painfully naive? Who knows?) For Markley, rock'n'roll was the elixir of youth, and an easy way to meet young girls. The band let him join because he could equip them with the best light show in town (which effectively made their name and got them a deal with Reprise), yet according to the other band members, his game plan was skirt-chasing and the music was irrelevent. Though the trio were more than capable, there's no doubt that Markley's cod-poetry and sloganeering gave the band a shamanic quality. His lyrics were obsessed with childhood, fleeting beauty and innocence, and war - he came across like an advertising exec who had studied Jim Morrison and swallowed the hype whole. Eventually, Markley's egomania spiralled into madness. He was severely beaten in Chicago, wrecking his looks, and inherited a fortune only to have it wasted as he vegetated, hospitalised. People aren't even sure if he's still alive. \"I'm not very big on religion,\" says Shaun Harris, \"but if there's such a thing as karma he could be poster boy for it.\"</p> <p>All of these stories follow the classic pop culture rule - never get old and boring. Reading the venomous reviews for the last album by pop's premier archivists Primal Scream, Bobby Gillespie will have understood better than most that his band have outstayed their welcome, and their hero status has been rattled. But if he could go and visit Bob Markley, he probably wouldn't want to swap.</p> <h2>Unknown soldiers - pick of the cult heroes</h2> <p><strong>Edwyn Collins on Vic Godard</strong></p> <p>\"When you mention Vic Godard, everybody still goes 'who'? Only the real cognoscenti know who he is. I first met him when I was stood outside the Lyceum in Edinburgh. He was playing with Subway Sect, along with the Slits and the Jam, but Subway Sect were my favourites. I asked if I could carry his gear in. I didn't meet him again until 1991 or 1992. Geoff Travis put us together, and I produced Vic's album End of the Surrey People. Paul Cook was his drummer by then, and he was a bit cagy, a bit protective. He thought I was taking the piss.\"</p> <p><strong>Gabriella Cilmi on Band of Horses</strong></p> <p>\"I was on the same episode of Later ... as they were, but I missed them because I was too nervous. I heard their album a little while later and loved it - the way they're hairy, rough-looking, middle Americans, but they sing, 'Nobody's gonna love you more ...' They could do well on American country stations, but their sound doesn't really slot in there either. I saw them at Shepherd's Bush Empire - they played three encores, and people went 'shhhh' in the quiet bits. I think that qualifies them as a cult band.\"</p> <p><strong>Barry Hyde (Futureheads) on Alex Chilton</strong></p> <p>\"He is the cult hero's cult hero. Especially for the Big Star albums. The third is his masterpiece. There are no rules on it, none at all. Most albums have some kind of theme, but this is as disjointed as music gets, and somehow it's sublime. He's gone on to influence other cult heroes like the Cocteau Twins and Jeff Buckley. Would I like to meet him? Yeah! We could have a chat over a bottle of white wine. But I'd like to know what kind of mood he'd be in first.\"</p> <p><strong>Jon Savage on Skip Spence</strong></p> <p>\"Skip Spence was the drummer for Jefferson Airplane, before he became the singer, guitarist and leading light of Moby Grape. His contributions to their first three albums were marked by a wild logic rare even in those extreme times: just listen to Omaha, Indifference, Motorcycle Irene or Seeing - the last is just like Syd Barrett's Scream Thy Last Scream, being a tone poem of madness and despair. Institutionalised in New York's Bellevue hospital after a violent episode, he travelled to Nashville at the end of 1968 to record his masterpiece, Oar. He looked brilliant: the cover is one of the most iconic pictures of the period. Spence died in 1999, leaving a 90-minute or so legacy of some of the most extreme psychedelic music ever made.\"</p>",
  "<p>The late, great BBC athletics commentator Ron Pickering was fond of the phrase \"in every sense of the word\", usually delivering it after a short and meaningful pause. Quite often he would combine it with an adulatory \"this\". \"THIS very much the man, in every sense of the word,\" Pickering would growl as Daley Thompson crushed his arch-rival, J\u00fcrgen Hingsen of West Germany, simply by smirking at him over the long jump pit.</p> <p>I have spent most of my early mornings for the past fortnight in Pickeringesque awe, waking the household at 6am by gazing at Britain's medal tally and intoning loudly: \"And THIS literally fabulous, in every sense of the word.\" Because as a friend of mine observed the other day: \"Every time I see the medal table, I think, bloody hell, so this is what it must feel like to be an Australian.\" </p> <p>As my friend later explained, if it hadn't been for Paula Radcliffe crying in the marathon and Sharron Davies looking scary by the swimming pool he would have thought he had gone insane and was making the whole thing up. In such a time of dizzying changes you need a pillar of certainty to hold on to.</p> <p>Luckily we also have the cycling commentator Hugh Porter, a man you really couldn't make up, even after six double espressos and a large bag of Haribo Tangtastics - not my normal breakfast I assure you, but if you want to compete at this level you have to be prepared to go that extra mile. </p> <p>To the garage, in my case. On Wednesday morning Porter was at his high-tar, gurgling best. \"Oooh, and she's gone down like a real box of tricks,\" he informed the nation as Shanaze Reade tumbled over in the BMX competition. </p> <p>(Isn't the BMX mass-start race fantastic, by the way? It's like watching kids pretending to be on motorbikes. Once or twice I think I've seen some of the competitors twisting the right handlebar grip like it was a throttle, and making revving noises. I bet some of them have stuck an ice-lolly stick in the back wheels so it makes a machine-gun rattle when they go fast, too. It's the best event that has been brought into the Olympics since they introduced snowboarding, which, unsurprisingly, also looks like something invented by children. For 2012, I say we should get some pedal go-karting in there, introduce swinging on a tarzie rope to the men's gymnastics and make the football 38-a-side.)</p> <p>No, what I am compelled by law to call The Great Haul of China is proving deeply disorienting. All our past Olympics have been spent smiling through adversity and \"taking positives\" (though clearly not \"in every sense of the word\") from British performances. \"She's finished 27th,\" we have said, \"but clearly there are a lot of positives she can take forward from that because she is only 32 and with her year-on-year improvement of 0.05 seconds, by the time we get to 2016 she should have a very real chance of threatening to break into the top eight.\"</p> <p>This time around, however, the difficulty has come in taking negatives from things. Brendan Foster made a bold attempt with a tirade about our middle- and long-distance runners on Wednesday evening but Sue Barker was in too bubbly a mood to let him get away with it for long. Like the rest of us, Sue is drunk on gold. For once, finishing second is not good enough. That silver medal in the high jump which was won by a man with his leg held together with gaffer tape would normally have been the cause for street parties. This time he'll be lucky if he gets a smile from his newsagent. </p> <p>But if the performance of Team GB is tough on those who finish second it is even harder on those of us in the columning game. Frankly, one man's Olympic heartbreak is another's 800-word rant on what this latest failure of our so-called sports people tells us about life in Gordon Brown's Britain. Even for the veterans among us it has been a real struggle. Looking on the dark side this Olympics has been a task that even Eeyore would have had trouble with - not that he'd have expected it to be easy, obviously.</p> <p>Luckily we have been able to take refuge in huffy nostalgia. America's Michael Phelps, for instance, has been touted as the greatest-ever Olympian. I am not alone in dismissing the claim with a derisive snort. I think Phelps will only truly have earned that title if at the next Games he does what his illustrious predecessor in the pool, Mark Spitz, did in Munich in 1972 and handicaps himself with a Beach Boys hairdo and the sort of luxurious moustache normally seen taking cover under the flaring nostrils of Lee Van Cleef. </p> <p>Pundits these days are constantly assuring us that victory at the highest level of sport is all about the tiny details. \"It's about hundredths of a second! It's about the tiny details!\" they yelp as the world watches Usain Bolt streak to victory by 10 yards despite the fact that he has only one shoe on and is wearing a sandwich-board advertising cut-price tickets for The Lion King instead of a vest. </p> <p>Bolt, however, is, as David Coleman once said of Michael Johnson, \"a freak in the most positive sense of that word\". For the rest it really is all about minutiae, and in that case you can only wonder how much more Spitz might have achieved if he'd cut his hair and had a proper shave. The exact drag coefficient of that 'tache of his is hard to calculate, but given its square meterage and lush thickness, I estimate that when wet it must have weighed the same as a cocker spaniel. If Phelps really wants to impress us in 2012, let's see him gathering up a fistful of gold medals while swimming with a gun dog sitting on his face. In every sense of the word.</p>",
  "<p>Looking back through August 2008 eyes, many commentators now seem to treat the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago this week as a primarily geopolitical event. The coincidence of Russia's invasion of Georgia and the anniversary of the Czech invasion of 1968 perhaps makes it understandable that some should colour their thinking about the crushing of the Prague Spring this way. In this elision, securing their near-abroad against their empire's enemies is what tsars in Moscow always do, whether the threat du jour is from American capitalists or Georgian nationalists. The common theme, in other words, is always Russian power politics.</p> <p>Undeniably there are important and ominous connections here - and they are ominous not only to those who live in any country in that vast geographic Russian border arc that stretches south from Finland to the Black Sea and then east from the Caucasus towards Mongolia. No other state in the contemporary world treats its neighbours' sovereignty with as much cynicism as Russia - and those who are rightly outraged by illegal invasions ought of course to say so. Or have I somehow been watching the Olympics so much that I missed the million-strong anti-war demonstration?</p> <p>Yet to concentrate on the geopolitics of enduring Russian insecurity is to downplay some of the other large historical lessons of what happened in August 1968 - and certainly to misrepresent what seemed to be most important about those events at the time. That is because the central question in the eight months between the appointment of Alexander Dubcek as first secretary of the Czechoslovak communist party at the start of January 1968 and the overnight arrival of 500,000 Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops on August 21 of that year was less geostrategic than political.</p> <p>That question was big and it was simple. Could the Soviet communist model of socialism be reformed or not? Today we know the answer. But the world of 1968 could not be so sure. The question was at the heart of the Prague Spring. Dubcek's reforms raised the possibility that there could be some kind of democratic socialist third way in which collective goals and socialist projects coexisted with democracy, free institutions and individual freedoms. Tony Judt is right to argue in his great book, Postwar, that the slogan of socialism with a human face was not just rhetorical and right to insist that the Prague 68ers didn't \"really\" want to import liberal capitalism. They actually believed that reformed socialism could work.</p> <p>The reform question was not being asked only in Czechoslovakia itself. It was also being posed to some degree in all the Soviet client states of eastern Europe, though manifestly under less open circumstances, as well as in limited ways under the repressive conditions of the USSR itself - and beyond. For it was being asked too, though in different ways by all those on the left, including on the left in this country, who believed that Stalinism represented the betrayal not just of 1917 but also of an otherwise still valid revolutionary socialist tradition.</p> <p>The invasion of August 1968 put an end to all that. Even so, it took a while for the full implications of the invasion to sink in. As Zdenek Mlynar, a leading Czech reform Communist, later put it (as told by Judt), when Red Army troops burst in on a meeting of Dubcek's politburo and lined up behind each member, the future of socialism was not the uppermost thought in most people's minds. \"But at the same time,\" Mlynar went on, \"you know that it has a direct connection of some sort with the automatic weapon pointing at your back.\"</p> <p>August 21 1968 was not the day that communism died. But it was the day that communism's death sentence was confirmed. Christopher Hitchens had a neat way of encapsulating the whole thing during a debate at the Hay festival earlier this year. If you flip 68 upside down, he said, you get 89. In eastern Europe the protest generation of 1968 was the generation who then replaced the Soviet system 21 years later. Dubcek himself, however, re-emerging in 1989 from long years of obscurity in the Slovak forests, was not part of it. Even in 1989 he remained wedded to the possibility of communist reform, even as communism was dissolving around him.</p> <p>Yet August 1968 was also the beginning of a more general crisis for socialists of all kinds. Many in the western left in 1968 believed that Dubcek's reform programme, though noble, was doomed. The Soviet invasion duly confirmed their view. Yet however firmly the western left dissociated itself from Soviet communism's own crisis, many on the left remained wedded in various ways to the same ideological - and in some cases the violent and lawless - traditions of the French revolution, out of which the Soviet Union had itself also been forged. Yet it was not just the Soviet variant of this inheritance that was now collapsing. It was all of them. They didn't work. People did not want them.</p> <p>Forty years on from the Russian tanks, the eclipse of socialism is now as general in the west as it is in the former Soviet lands further east - perhaps even more so. Most people who consider themselves to be on the left - whatever that really means in the post-1989 world - are aware at some level of this reality. Not enough of them, though, admit to it or what it implies for serious public politics. Even today, far too few of those who admit the reality seem to be prepared to think through what a credible, sellable, historically aware but modern progressive project that could really - as opposed to optimistically - command sustained majority support in our post-socialist world should consist of. </p> <p>Very few parties of the left have been equal to this task. In Britain in the 1990s, New Labour began to ask such questions, but not in a sustained way. Too many key, but hard, issues were ruled off the agenda. Yet the mere fact that Labour attempted this task at all led to astonishing electoral dividends. Electoral success, however, meant that the political task was never carried through. That disastrous neglect - especially, I increasingly think, the failure to address it in 2001 - remains at the heart of Labour's current and now perhaps terminal eclipse. Hardly anyone - least of all Gordon Brown - articulates clearly and credibly what the Labour party exists to do. After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia the old political map was no longer usable. But the new map has yet to be drawn, let alone followed.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Kazakh miner Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation yesterday rejected suggestions that it should offer its largest shareholder and rival Kazakhmys a seat on its board, as it reported maiden profits of more than $2bn (\u00a31bn).</p> <p>Half-year pre-tax profits at ENRC, which floated on the London Stock Exchange in December, jumped to $2.05bn from $586m last year thanks to record prices for ferrochrome, used in steelmaking. Revenues soared by 86% to $3.4bn. It is paying its first interim dividend of 12 cents a share. The shares, which made their debut at 540p, rose 35p to \u00a310.62 yesterday, up 3.4%. Shares in Kazakhmys, a copper miner, rose 64p to \u00a313.24, up 5%. Both were among the biggest risers on the FTSE 100.</p> <p>After rebuffing a takeover approach from ENRC this year, smaller rival Kazakhmys has built a stake of 25% in the group, but said last week it had no plans to bid for ENRC. ENRC's market value is twice that of Kazakhmys. The government of Kazakhstan holds stakes of about 15% in both companies and there has been speculation that it could arrange a deal to form a \"national champion\".</p> <p>Sir David Cooksey, ENRC's chairman, said: \"We do not believe that it is in the interest of shareholders that Kazakhmys should have a seat on the board of ENRC.\" He said because both groups were competing for resources, there would be a conflict of interest if a Kazakhmys representative sat on the ENRC board and took part in strategic decisions. The group rejected suggestions that the Kazakhmys stake would prevent it from making further acquisitions. Only a simple majority of shareholders is needed to approve deals.</p> <p>ENRC - the world's largest producer of ferrochrome - announced plans to nearly double its capital expenditure to $6.9bn, including six new furnaces, as demand for stainless steel remains high. \"Despite macro-economic uncertainties, we expect higher commodity prices to hold,\" said Johannes Sittard, chief executive \"We anticipate a very strong performance in the second half.\"</p> <p>The news came as Hochschild, the Latin American silver and gold miner, posted an 86% increase in core first-half earnings. The world's fourth-biggest silver producer made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $104m, with revenues soaring 92% to $231.8m boosted by higher prices for precious metals.</p> <p>\"This is a year of consolidation for Hochschild and I am pleased to announce solid interim results,\" said Eduardo Hochschild, executive chairman . \"With a stronger-than-ever project pipeline, I look to the future with confidence.\"</p> <p>The company, which has six mines in Peru, Argentina and Mexico, said it was on track to achieve its 2008 output target of 26m silver equivalent ounces, up from 25.7m last year.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have moved to stop failed asylum seekers appealing to the high court against deportation. A Home Office consultation paper published yesterday proposes \"streamlining\" the asylum appeals process by blocking access to high court judicial reviews for some failed asylum seekers.

A critical report by the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, on Yarl's Wood detention centre published today highlights the plight of children held at the Bedfordshire centre.</p> <p>She says that 83 out 450 children held at Yarl's Wood between May and October last year were detained for more than 28 days. She says this included a period of chicken pox quarantine and highlights the case of a disabled child detained at Yarl's Wood pending deportation.</p> <p>Donna Covey of the Refugee Council said it was vital that the integrity of the asylum appeals process was maintained.</p> <p>\"One in five appeals are successful - this clearly shows that appeals provide a vital safety net,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We must ensure that the process is of the highest quality and that it is subject to effective judicial scrutiny.\"</p> <p>She added: \"If the low numbers of asylum seekers to the UK were the result of the world becoming a safer, more peaceful place, then we would have something to celebrate.</p> <p>\"As it is, we have real concerns that people who need our help and protection are not able to get here to access it. We need to ensure that our borders remain open to refugees who are in fear for their lives.\"</p>",
  "<p>Shares in telecoms group <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless</strong> have had a good run recently, mainly fuelled by hopes that the management will break up the business into a UK operation and an international one, once its proposed takeover of rival Thus is completed.

Chairman Terry Smith's other company, interdealer broker <strong>Tullett Prebon</strong>, is already in talks to be taken over by US group GFI. Tullett dipped 2p to 424.25p.</p> <p>Overall the market was struggling for direction yesterday. A rise in commodity prices, especially oil, was countered by further weakness in financial stocks thanks to uncertainty over US mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and a fall in Lehman Brothers on reports it had failed to sell a stake to South Korean and Chinese funds.</p> <p>So <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong> lost 10.25p to 280p, <strong>Barclays</strong> fell 4p to 311p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> dropped 4.5p to 209.5p.

Add in its net cash and Invensys remains the outstanding value play in UK capital goods.\"</p> <p>Retailers were generally unmoved by the surprising jump in sales in July, with analysts pointing out that figures had been notoriously volatile in recent months. <strong>JJB Sports</strong>, in the middle of a recovery programme and buoyed up recently by hopes of a management buyout, dipped 8p to 124p. Kaupthing analysts said: \"If the rumour is well founded the shares could have another 20-30% upside.

  "<p>The price of oil jumped by more than $6 a barrel yesterday, as a sliding dollar and anxiety about a new cold war between Russia and the west prompted investors to buy commodities.</p> <p>Reversing part of the decline in crude since its record high of $147 a barrel early last month, oil pushed back above $120 a barrel in morning trading in New York.</p> <p>Moscow's frosty reaction to the signing of a deal between the United States and Poland to set up part of a US missile defence shield was cited by analysts as one factor behind the jump in oil, with the dollar's biggest fall against the euro in six weeks and concern that tropical storm Fay could re-enter the Gulf of Mexico also helping to drive prices up.</p> <p>\"Crude is rallying as the dollar is down and there's this ongoing geopolitical tension between Russia and the west,\" said Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF in Houston. After threatening to drop below $110 a barrel last week, the possibility that Moscow would limit supplies of energy through its pipelines to the west has driven up the cost of crude.</p> <p>On the foreign exchanges, the dollar was affected by the problems of US mortgage firms Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. </p> <p>Other commodities followed oil's lead. Gold rose above $800 an ounce while British wholesale gas prices hit a new record yesterday, driven by the rise in the oil price and Wednesday's closure of the Kvitebj\u00f8rn field after a gas leak in the pipeline connecting it to the processing plant.</p> <p>Gas for winter 2008/09 (October to March) had already touched 104p a therm on Wednesday and then hit 109p yesterday, well ahead of the 105p record set in June.

  "<p>A shortage of blockbuster films caused admissions to drop 5% in the first half of the year, cinema chain Cineworld said yesterday. But the group still reported a 1% rise in box-office receipts thanks to an increase in the average price of tickets, helping the company to post a similar increase in overall revenues.</p> <p>Filmgoers stayed at home until the two big hits of the spring, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Sex and the City, were released in June, Cineworld said. Earlier in the year the group, which operates 74 cinemas with 770 screens across the UK and Ireland, relied on the continuing popularity of last year's I Am Legend.</p> <p>But Cineworld said it had made a strong start to the second half of the year, thanks to the success of films such as Mamma Mia and The Dark Knight, and was looking forward to an autumn line-up that includes the new James Bond offering, Quantum of Solace, Madagascar 2 and High School Musical 3. </p> <p>The group's chairman, Terry Bloom, said the group was weathering the economic downturn. \"The enduring appeal of film continues to be even more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty and we feel confident that the strong line-up of films in the second half will drive admissions, particularly in the fourth quarter,\" he said.</p> <p>Cineworld's revenues were up 0.9% year on year to \u00a3137m in the 26 weeks to June 26, with \u00a389.6m coming from the box office. Although admissions slipped by more than 1m, from 21.7m to 20.6m, the average ticket price per admission was up 6.1%, or 25p to \u00a34.34, reflecting a higher proportion of adult-oriented films.</p> <p>The average customer spent \u00a31.73 on food and drink, up 5.4% or 9p from the same period last year. The group put this down to its decision to bring in Coffee Republic and Carlsberg as its suppliers, along with the installation of more Ben &amp; Jerry's ice-cream kiosks and the upgrading of several of its retail areas. Retail revenues were up fractionally at \u00a335.6m, while other revenues - including screen advertising, ticket bookings, sponsorships, games and other machines - increased by 2.6% to \u00a311.8m.</p> <p>The group said its market share in the UK had held firm at 25.3%.</p>",
  "<p>A rising birth rate has fuelled an increase in Britain's population to nearly 61 million last year - an increase over 12 months of 388,000, equivalent to a city the size of Bournemouth. </p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said that the fertility rate in the UK is now at 1.91 children per woman - the highest level since 1973 - with 758,000 babies born last year.</p> <p>The figures, released yesterday, show the population of the UK grew by nearly 2 million between 2001 and 2007. The statisticians said the rising birth rate has also been influenced by the growing number of women of childbearing age in the country. </p> <p>Births to foreign-born mothers rose to 160,340, or 23% of all live births, last year. More than half of all births in some towns and cities, including London (54%), Slough (56%) and Luton (51%), were to non-UK born mothers. This figure peaks at 75% in the London borough of Newham.</p> <p>Annual migration figures published yesterday confirmed that immigration is playing a smaller role in the UK's population growth, down from 72% in 2001 to 52% in 2007.</p> <p>The latest figures for east European workers registering for jobs in Britain show that the biggest wave of migration in the country's recent history has peaked. There were 40,000 applicants, mainly from Poland, who came between April and June this year, compared with 54,000 over the same period last year - a drop of 14,000. The number of Bulgarians and Romanians applying to work in the UK has also fallen, with only 7,000 applying in April-June this year.</p> <p>The ONS said long-term migration to the UK reached 605,000 in 2007, the highest recorded level since the figures started to be collected in their current form in 1991. At the same time long-term migration from the UK - those leaving the country - hit 406,000, also the highest recorded total since 1991, and 21,000 up on the previous year and 95,000 more than in 2001.</p> <p>Net international migration, the difference between people coming to settle in the country and those leaving, was 198,000, up slightly from 187,000 in 2001.</p> <p>Of 16,800 people whose applications for asylum were rejected last year, 13,705 were removed or left voluntarily, compared with 18,280 in 2006.</p> <p>Jill Rutter, of the Institute of Public Policy Research, said the statistics showed that the immigration tide was turning. \"Just because we have had high immigration over the last 10 years doesn't mean that the next 10 years will be the same,\" she said. \"As eastern Europeans arrive, asylum numbers fall and there is reduced demand for migrant workers, we would expect the nature of migration flows to change.\"</p> <p>She said the challenge in the next few years would be to attract enough migrant workers with the right skills to drive economic growth in the UK.</p> <p>Home Office statistics published yesterday also disclose growing chaos in the citizenship application system. They show that new applications rose by 26% between April and June this year to nearly 40,000 from 12 months earlier. The number of decisions taken fell by 42% to 25,375 over the same period. The Home Office said staff had been temporarily transferred from decision-making to deal with the increase in new applications.</p> <h2>Britain's oldie capital</h2> <p>Yesterday's population figures show that the over-60s now outnumber children for the first time, and with 32% of its population eligible to collect their pension, Chichester in West Sussex can claim to be Britain's oldie capital. </p> <p>Built by the Romans, the city is picturesque but small. The mayor, David Siggs, says: \"A lot of people come from the north. Chichester is a city of human scale. You can walk about and it's not so huge that you're just a face in the crowd. Plus, there aren't any nightclubs.\" An application six years ago was given short shrift, he says.</p> <p>Local developers have targeted retirees, says Siggs, with several developments reserved for the over-50s close to the city centre. \"Of course they bring benefits, but the cost of housing has gone up with so many people coming here who have made money from selling their properties.\"</p> <p>\"There are some places where people migrate to rather than retire from,\" says Myles Cullen, leader of the district council. \"The climate is excellent, we have a wonderful coastal area, it's incredibly picturesque.\" <br><strong>Esther Addley</strong></p>",

  "<p>More than a year after abortion was decriminalised in Mexico City, abortion opponents hope the Mexican supreme court will reverse the legislation in a decision that could reverberate across Mexico and Latin America.</p> <p>Mexico's highest court heard public testimony in the spring, and is expected to rule as early as this month on the constitutionality of the local abortion measure.</p> <p>The Federal District is governed by the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution. Through its control of the city assembly, the party in April 2007 legalised abortion in the city for women who are up to 12 weeks pregnant.</p> <p>The measure is unusual because it legalises abortion in the capital. Except in cases of rape or risks to the mother's life, abortion remains illegal in most of rest of this devoutly Roman Catholic nation.</p> <p>States in Mexico set their own policies on abortion rights, and only Yucatan in Mexico's far south has allowed abortion in cases of extreme poverty.</p> <p>University studies estimate between 500,000 and 1 million abortions take place in Mexico annually, but most are of questionable legality.</p> <p>The Catholic Church and anti-abortion activists want the high court to strike down the Mexico City measure. They argue that life begins at conception and carrying out an abortion amounts to a taking of life that violates Mexico's constitution.</p> <p>\"A person's life has such a great value that we cannot take it, we are not the owners,\" insists Ana Elena Cantu, a city legislator in the northern industrial city of Monterrey and an anti-abortion leader in Mexico.</p> <p>But the 11 members of Mexico's high court may look beyond the constitutional question.</p> <p>\"It is not a philosophical debate. It is mostly about the criminality. Should you or should you not be penalising it,\" said Miguel Sarre, a university law professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.</p> <p>In prior rulings, Mexico's high court declared abortion to be a crime but said it should not be penalised.</p> <p>That ruling mollified both sides, but such a broad decision is unlikely this time, Sarre said, partly because Mexico City is drawing women in from other parts of the nation for abortions.</p> <p>Since May 2007, 12 participating public hospitals in Mexico City have performed more than 12,000 free abortions, and are averaging about 35 to 40 such procedures per day, according to the city's director of emergency medical services, Dr. Arturo Gaytan. Most of the women are poor, he said.</p> <p>\"There isn't a way to measure this. What was clandestine is now authorised. We don't know what the measure is outside these medical units,\" Gaytan said.</p> <p>Women who could afford it traditionally went to private clinics for abortions that technically were illegal. Today, these clinics continue to perform the procedures, but women who visit them have more recourse.</p> <p>\"If something happens, your family or you have legal grounds to allege negligence,\" said Daphne, a 23-year-old law student who first spoke to McClatchy Newspapers in March 2007 as she readied to have an abortion just weeks before it became legal.</p> <p>Speaking again on condition that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy, Daphne said she would still choose a private clinic today for an abortion because \"people are still afraid of the (public) institutions\".</p> <p>To combat that image of poor quality, city health officials point to the number of recorded deaths of mothers during the procedure. In 2005, 15 women died during a reported abortion, eight in 2006, one in 2007 and none in 2008, Gaytan said.</p> <p>\"What this suggests is that procedures in clandestine areas have disappeared and given way to this,\" he said.</p> <p>Of the now-decriminalised abortions at public hospitals, 39 percent involved women who already have children and cannot afford another. Students represented almost 27 percent of the women seeking abortions, while 20 percent were maids and domestic workers. In 58 percent of the cases, the women seeking an abortion had an intrauterine device implanted to prevent another unwanted pregnancy.</p>",
  "<p>My neighbour has loads more snails in his garden than I have in mine. This might be because of the more shaded aspect, the wider areas of undisturbed soil or, just possibly, because I've been slinging snails over the wall for the past two years.</p> <p>I don't do this out of any sense of malice to either snail or neighbour - even though his filthy bloody cat has so sprayed my shed with his pheromone-rich secretions that I occasionally come into oestrus just getting the lawnmower out - it's just that my policy of forced airborne snail repatriation saves my veg and is preferable to stamping on them, salting them or eating them - or at least that's what I thought until this morning.</p> <p>I was out in the garden, picking up the windfalls, pulling a few carrots and preparing to deport a couple of dozen snails, still wet with dew, when I stayed my hand. Here I am, fashionably foraging, doing my bit to be sustainable and to carve out a living in the Camden Town Dust Bowl and I'm ignoring a time-honoured and delicious source of protein, the Somerset Wallfish, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix_aspersa\"><em>Helix Aspersa</em></a> \u2026 the garden snail.<br><br>It makes loads of sense. I pride myself on eating anything; I actually like escargots; I need to get rid of a couple of dozen of the things every day and yet \u2026 I don't know, it just feels sort of weird. I mean this shouldn't feel like a bush-tucker trial. English garden snails are entirely edible. The special snails famously introduced by the Romans may have racier shell designs but, boiled for 40 minutes and drowned in garlic butter, I can't imagine I'm going to be able to detect differences in flavour, tenderness or hanging. There are English recipes going back centuries, hell, we've been exporting our snails to the French since the 1890s - we should all be cheerfully necking them. I still feel a strange resistance to the idea but I intend to overcome it. </p> <p>Restaurants buy snails from farms where they've been fed from birth on entirely wholesome veg but a Camden snail is as likely to have spent last night in a discarded crack pipe as on a lettuce leaf so I've dug up various, seemingly contradictory instructions for <a href=\"http://www.heliciculture.co.uk/purging.asp?section=technical\">purging</a>.</p> <p>Some snail foragers reckon purging is for cissies, an entirely unnecessary step - which I guess may be true if your foraging ground is some sylvan idyll and you like eating grit - but most agree on a period of between three days and a month in an environment where food and conditions can be controlled. A bucket with a pair of tights stretched over the top of it seems to be the favoured method as snails can apparently gang up and lift even the heaviest lids off other containers - a fact that fills me with respect and not a little fear for the little buggers when mob-handed - where they can be fed on lettuce, oatmeal or in one particularly cunning bit of pre-seasoning, wine and handfuls of fresh leafy herbs.</p> <p>I'm reckoning that even the most crack-headed snail in NW1 can't be so constipated that they won't be cleaned out in a week. So this evening I'm going hunting. I'll collect and purge a couple of dozen of the best specimens I can find and, in about 10 days, I'll post again, describing the cooking process. OK, I realise this isn't quite on the scale of slaughtering my own pig but I hope I'll be able to overcome my squeamishness long enough to tell you how they taste. </p> <p>In the meantime, does anyone else fancy having a go? Any tips or suggestions? Any thoughts as to why this idea seems quite so off-putting?</p>",
  "<p>Proof at last that sketch shows are not the sole preserve of young white men with RP accents. Angry Puppy are four Scotswomen with a neat line in caustic comedy, in the local vernacular or otherwise. Little energy is expended being wacky or clever-clever: these sketches are anchored in the real world. This is dramatised observational comedy with a high hit-rate, reaffirming that life is populated by characters as funny as anything made up.</p> <p>Several skits have the cordite whiff of Glasgow about them. One fine scene sees two girls shopping for a stereo and taking volcanic offence when the assistant offers them a Matsui. (\"Dae I look like someone who lives in a bin?\") And there's a great running joke about a chippy wee lassie to whom every innocent game with her pal veils an insult directed at her beloved dad.</p> <p>But if the accents supply an earthy local flavour, the subjects are universal. I liked the doctor who counsels a first-time mum: \"Believe you me, your fucking life is over!\" And an acerbic skit about girlfriends rallying to absolve a woman from blame when she kills a cyclist: \"In life, sometimes people make mistakes,\" coos one pal sympathetically, \"or just do bad things on purpose...\" And there's a wonderful silent sequence in which all four struggle, one after another, to get the lid off a jar. The joke, incidentally, could have been milked for twice as long.</p> <p>The quality dips when the sketches stray towards zanier material: a scene about the man who makes up those daft ice-cream names, for example, or another about a tots' TV show with characters called Murrafugga and Cacksucker. But generally this is promising stuff, from four women with distinctive but complementary personalities. The Puppy may be Angry, but the audience leave with tails wagging.</p>",

He refused, claiming ill health, and spent more than 20 hours in the transit lounge at Bangkok airport. </p> <p>Lieutenant General Chatchawal Suksomchit, the chief of Thailand's immigration police, said Glitter was denied entry under Thai immigration laws used to bar entry to those convicted of child sex abuse in a foreign country. Another officer said his department received a note from Vietnam and Interpol requesting that Gadd not be allowed to enter Thailand.</p> <p>Gadd was convicted of downloading child pornography in the UK in 1999 after a computer repair shop found the images on his laptop. He served two months of a four-month sentence. </p> <p>He moved to Spain and Cuba before travelling to south-east Asia where he was eventually tracked down by reporters.</p> <p>He was kicked out of Cambodia after facing allegations of sex crimes and moved to the Vietnamese coastal resort of Vung Tau. </p> <p>The two girls at first made allegations of rape, which carries a death sentence, but were reportedly paid off with \u00a31,175. </p> <p>Gadd was arrested trying to leave the country and stood trial, pleading not guilty and claiming he was teaching the girls English. He was convicted and sentenced in March 2006 to three years' jail. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said Britain could not enforce Gadd's return but must have a plan if he did. </p> <p>On his arrival in the UK, he is to be met at the airport by police officers and served with an order that will effectively put him on the register of known sex offenders.</p> <p>Dr Zoe Hilton, a policy adviser at the NSPCC, said: \"This clearly illustrates why it's so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children. </p> <p>\"Offenders like Glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the UK where they can be properly monitored. It is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work. </p> <p>\"This case is important because it highlights how easy it is for UK offenders to move around freely when they are overseas - even those who pose a high risk to children.\"</p>",
  "<p>Binyam Mohamed, the last remaining Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainee with an automatic right to return to the UK, faces the death penalty after being charged with terrorism offences by the Pentagon.</p> <p>He was arrested in Pakistan as he tried to board a flight to Britain in April 2002 travelling on a false passport, the US government says in its <a href=\"http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104muhammad.pdf\">charge sheet (pdf)</a> against him.</p> <p>The Pentagon alleges that Mohamed, an Ethiopian national who claimed asylum in Britain when he was 16, travelled to Afghanistan in May 2001 and attended terror training camps where he was lectured by Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>It says he trained for city warfare and fought on the Taliban frontline against Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan in late 2001. </p> <p>He went on a bomb-making course and travelled to Pakistan where he met and conspired with Jose Padilla, a US citizen and former Chicago gang member who was last year convicted by a federal court of conspiracy and material support for terrorism.</p> <p>While in Pakistan, Mohamed and Padilla discussed the feasibility of constructing an improvised dirty bomb from instructions they had read on a computer, it is alleged. </p> <p>Prosecutors claim they also discussed plans to attack petrol tankers and spray nightclubbers with cyanide.</p> <p>Senior al-Qaida leaders in Pakistan then allegedly ordered Mohamed on a mission to attack high-rise flats and petrol stations.</p> <p>Today's <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgment_guidance/judgments/mohamed210808.htm\">high court judgment says</a> that much of the case against Mohamed is believed to have been compiled from confessions he made in Bagram, Afghanistan, between May and September 2004, and in Guant\u00e1namo Bay before November 2004.</p> <p>The judges said, and the British government agreed, that Mohamed has established an arguable case that he was first held by the US incommunicado without access to a lawyer or a court in Pakistan; that he was held in cruel and inhuman conditions; and that he was subject to torture during his detention by or on behalf of the US.</p> <p>The court established that the British security services facilitated the interrogation of Mohamed in Pakistan, and that he was seen by British agents in detention. The British security service provided interrogation questions and information about Mohamed in the full knowledge of the reported conditions of his detention and treatment.</p> <p>Mohamed claims he was then rendered to Morocco, where he was subjected to more prolonged and brutal torture, including the repeated slashing of his genitals with a razor blade, after being made to \"disappear\".</p> <p>Finally, he was rendered to Guant\u00e1namo, where he has spent the past four years.</p> <p>In August last year, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, formally asked the Bush administration to release Mohamed and four other UK residents at Guant\u00e1namo. </p> <p>Three of the men were sent home, but the US refused to release Mohamed and Saudi-born Shaker Aamer, citing security concerns.</p> <p>In May, it was revealed that Mohamed had written to Gordon Brown, pleading with the prime minister to use his influence with the US president, George Bush, to stop a military court from sentencing him to death.</p> <p>According to Mohamed's legal team, after working as a caretaker in Kensington he travelled to Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2001 in an attempt to resolve \"personal issues\".</p>",
  "<p>Surveys show <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=43d55337-9c57-49ab-a23e-aa2a62703eba\">Polish public opinion</a> has rapidly shifted from wariness about hosting the US missile shield to outright enthusiasm. The reason is simple. Russia conducted a devastating counterattack against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgia</a> this month, and Poles are convinced the time for treading softly around the Russian bear has passed.</p> <p>Every Polish family has a compelling story about its role in history: stories of war, rebellion and defiance. By comparison to the average Brit, the average Pole is obsessed with the past and how it shapes the present. </p> <p>The first wave of Polish immigration to the UK took place at the end of the second world war, when an estimated 200,000 Poles were given British citizenship, one way or another, because of Kremlin foreign policy.</p> <p>Many had been deported by Russian troops from eastern Poland to Siberian concentration camps when the Nazis and Soviets were allied with each other at the start of the war. When the Soviets changed sides and allied with the British, the Poles were released and formed the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Anders\">Anders army</a>\", which trekked from Siberia to Iran to join the British army for the north Africa and Italy campaigns. </p> <p>These Polish war veterans couldn't return to their country at the end of the war, because it had been taken by Stalin at Yalta. Those naive enough to return faced imprisonment or death. The rest formed the Polish communities in Hammersmith, Ealing and elsewhere, that have given hope to Polish migrants ever since.</p> <p>So most Polish people, especially members of the Polish British community, relate to the subjects of history and international relations in a deeply personal way. My grandfather served in the Polish army that defeated the Soviet invasion of Europe 1920. My father lived through the 1944 Warsaw uprising, in which the Red Army stood by and watched Nazis massacre the inhabitants of the city. I have childhood memories of Poland in the 1970s and 1980s. We would talk subversively in the home, but knew not to breathe a word of it on the telephone or on the street, all because of the Kremlin's might.</p> <p>This said, neither I nor most people with Polish roots, including those whose families were deported to Siberia, have any dislike of Russian people. Quite the contrary, Poles love the Russian language, literature and music. Poles have sympathy for the Russian nation, because historically their leaders, from Ivan the Terrible to Josef Stalin have treated them even worse than they have treated the people of Poland.</p> <p>Until the Georgia crisis, Poles didn't want the US missile shield. It was seen as another demonstration of Bush lunacy: a piece of kit that didn't work; a $100bn subsidy of American aerospace; a defence against an Iran that would use a terror cell with a dirty bomb before an ICBM; and a middle finger to a Kremlin that will take any pretext to whip up Russian nationalism to distract from its own failings. </p> <p>But now, the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/20/poland.us.missile/?iref=hpmostpop\">10 interceptor missiles</a> headed for Poland have real power \u2013 and that power is symbolic rather than tactical. With American boots and hardware on the ground in their country, Poles feel that they cannot be let down in the way they have been so many times before. The Kremlin's recent behavior, and long memories in this part of the world, makes Poles want that certainty.</p>",
  "<p>Kazakh miner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/enrc&quot;\">Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</a> today rejected suggestions that it should offer its largest shareholder and rival Kazakhmys a board seat as it reported maiden profits of more than $2bn (\u00a31bn).</p> <p>Half-year pre-tax profits at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/10/lonmin.mining1\">ENRC, which floated on the London Stock Exchange in December</a>, jumped to $2.05bn from $586m last year thanks to record prices for <a href=\"http://metals.about.com/library/bldef-Ferro-Alloys.htm\">ferrochrome</a>, which is used in steelmaking. Revenues soared by 86% to $3.4bn. It is paying a maiden interim dividend of 12 cents a share. </p> <p>The shares, which debuted at 540p, jumped 47p to \u00a310.74, a rise of 4.6%. Shares in Kazakhmys, a copper miner, rose 56p to \u00a313.16, an increase of 4.4%. Both were among the biggest risers on the FTSE 100 today.</p> <p>After rebuffing a takeover approach from ENRC earlier this year, smaller rival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/12/commodities\">Kazakhmys has built a stake of 25% </a>in the group, but said last week it had no plans to bid for ENRC. ENRC's market value is twice that of Kazakhmys. The government of Kazakhstan holds stakes of around 15% in both companies and there has been speculation that it could arrange a deal to form a \"national champion\".</p> <p>ENRC's chairman, Sir David Cooksey, said: \"We do not believe that it is in the interest of all shareholders that Kazakhmys should have a seat on the board of ENRC.\" He said because both groups were competing for resources in Kazakhstan, there would be a conflict of interest if a Kazakhmys representative sat on the ENRC board and took part in strategic decisions. </p> <p>The group rejected suggestions that the Kazakhmys stake would prevent it from making further acquisitions. Only a simple majority of shareholders is needed to approve deals.</p> <p>ENRC - the world's largest producer of ferrochrome - unveiled plans to nearly double its capital expenditure to $6.9bn, including six new furnaces as demand for stainless steel remains high. </p> <p>\"Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, we expect higher commodity prices to hold,\" said chief executive Johannes Sittard. \"We anticipate a very strong performance in the second half.\"</p> <p>The news came as Hochschild, the Latin American silver and gold miner, posted an 86% increase in core first-half earnings. The world's fourth-biggest silver producer made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $104m, with revenues soaring 92% to $231.8m boosted by higher prices for precious metals.</p> <p>The shares, listed on the London stock market, advanced 6.75p to 261.5p, a rise of 2.7%.</p> <p>\"This is a year of consolidation for Hochschild Mining and I am pleased to announce solid interim results,\" said executive chairman Eduardo Hochschild. \"With production on track and a stronger-than-ever project pipeline, I look to the future with confidence.\"</p> <p>The company, which has six mines in Peru, Argentina and Mexico, said it was on track to achieve its 2008 output target of 26m silver equivalent ounces, up from 25.7m last year.<br></p>",
  "<p>Bj\u00f6rn Lomborg <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange\">accuses me</a> of scare tactics in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange\">my article</a> on the catastrophic consequences of a 4C temperature rise. But his confidence that global warming on this scale would have only moderate impacts, knocking global GDP by a mere 3.5% by 2300, is dangerously misplaced. Against Lomborg's outdated econometric models stands something infinitely more dependable and less reassuring: the geological record. </p> <p>The Earth has in the past undergone rapid and dramatic climate change. It is quite capable of maintaining a \"hothouse\" state as much as 10C warmer than today with ice-free poles and sea levels up to 100m higher - as it did between 100 and 40 million years ago. And an initial warming pulse of 5C or less - caused perhaps by an asteroid strike on limestone or coal deposits releasing thousands of gigatonnes of carbon to the atmosphere, or by volcanic eruptions - can trigger further warming processes that can multiply the intial temperature rise. </p> <p>It has happened before, and it could happen again. In geological terms there is little to choose between an a carbon release caused by an asteroid strike, and one caused by our burning fossil fuels. Already we are witnessing positive feedback processes in the climate system that threaten to amplify the warming pulse of just under 1C that humans have already delivered. If we ever reach 4C of warming there are likely to be many more such feedbacks, perhaps enough to flip the climate system into \"hothouse\" mode. </p> <p>If this should ever happen, the elaborate cost-benefit analyses of Lomborg and colleagues at his <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=788\">Copenhagen Consensus</a> will be so much waste paper. But that is not to dismiss economics as a whole - on the contrary. Nicholas Stern's <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm\">famous 2006 review</a> marked a major step forward in applying economics to climate change and yielded many useful findings - not least that swift and decisive action to mitigate climate change is the \"pro-growth strategy for the longer term\", and the sooner we do it the less it will cost us. </p> <p>But Stern's analysis, though powerful, is incomplete and understates the case for action. In particular it does not adequately encompass the risks of truly catastrophic change, as opposed to modulations applied to a business-as-usual scenario. A small perturbation - a temperature rise of 1C, for example, and a sea level rise of 0.1m - can fairly be considered in conventional terms. There will be both costs and benefits, but on the whole the world will carry on much as before. </p> <p>But the conventional approach breaks down entirely in the face of a very large change - such as a warming of 10C and a long-term 100m sea level rise. We need not lose any sleep over whether our descendants in 2100 might be a few percentage points richer or poorer than otherwise - after all, Lomborg assures us, they will be 1,700% richer on average. But we should be deeply concerned that we may leave them a seriously damaged world, incapable of supporting life - including human life - on anything like the scale and diversity we presently enjoy. It is hard, and arguably impossible, to put a figure on the economic cost of such an outcome, but it is certainly enormous. </p> <p>And as Martin Weitzman, professor of economics at Harvard University, points out in his widely-acclaimed paper <a href=\"http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/weitzman/files/REStatFINAL.pdf\">On Modeling and Interpreting the Economics of Catastrophic Climate Change</a> (pdf), very high-cost, low-probability outcomes are systematically ignored by current economic methods, when they should be placed at centre-stage. In Weitzman's own words, spending money now to slow global warming is not about \"optimal consumption smoothing\" (as Lomborg would have it), but about \"how much insurance to buy to offset the small chance of a ruinous catastrophe that is difficult to compensate by ordinary savings\". </p> <p>Taking out Weitzman's climate insurance means spending now to ensure that the \"ruinous catastrophe\" never happens. And to achieve this aim by investing $1 trillion per year (about 2% of World Product) as proposed in Kyoto2 is positively good value - all the more so as all the investments would bring about important additional human, economic and environmental benefits. Even without the threat of global warming the world would be better off by shifting towards renewable energy, raising energy efficiency, reversing deforestation, and ensuring the long term productivity of the world's farmland. Kyoto2 is the \"best solution\" that Lomborg is searching for.</p>",
  "<p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, said today he did not believe Russia would withdraw from his country in the coming days as promised, but the most Georgia could do in response was offer \"passive resistance\".</p> <p>The Russian army has been reducing its presence in some of the towns it has occupied, but is reportedly taking new territory and holding positions within 30 miles of the capital.</p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, yesterday told his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, that Russian troops would withdraw from most of Georgia by Friday. Some would go to Russia, according to the Kremlin, and others to South Ossetia and the security zone that extends four miles into Georgia along the South Ossetian border.</p> <p>There has been little or no change in the positions the Russians hold near the capital, or throughout much of the region. Saakashvili said that while Russia was withdrawing troops in some places, \"they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in Georgia\".</p> <p>He repeated his plea for help from the international community. \"We still expect more,\" he said. \"We still believe this is not all, that this is just a beginning.</p> <p>\"What we're seeing now is a clear regrouping and also, again, some kind of deception campaign, saying 'Look, we're moving out',\" Saakashvili said, adding that the Russians were \"making fun of the world\".</p> <p>Should the Russian occupation continue, he said, Georgians might begin peaceful protests and \"passive resistance\". He said Georgians would \"hold hands together ... and they will reconstruct\".</p> <p>Russia was \"dreaming to turn my country into Chechnya - into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force\".</p> <p>While the majority of Georgians supported Saakashvili's government during the fighting, this could change if the occupation continues and the 158,000 people who have been displaced are unable to return to their homes.</p> <p>Saakashvili said the popularity of his government would \"depend on how we will perform, how well we rebuild. The last thing I'm worried about is about my political future right now.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>Director: Ridley Scott<br>Entertainment grade: E<br>History grade: C\u2013</strong></p> <p>Kingdom of Heaven tells the story of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187, the climax of the Saracen sultan's dramatic reconquest of the Holy Land from the Crusaders. Saladin's victory triggered the Third Crusade, led by Richard the Lionheart. In Ridley Scott's film, it is also replete with allusions to modern American adventures in the Middle East.</p> <h2>People</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336790043\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/bloom220.jpg\" alt=\"Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disastrously miscast ...

In 1184, he sails for the Holy Land, but a storm wrecks his ship. Washed up on a Syrian beach, he makes for a watering hole. Two Arabs ride up, and there's a macho standoff. This plotline has nothing to do with the Crusades, but it is stolen shamelessly from Lawrence of Arabia. Almost seven and a half centuries out. Not a promising start.</p> <h2>Politics</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336790044\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/kingdom001.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven\" width=\"140\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Like the Green Goblin ...

He's wearing a silver mask that makes him look a bit like the Green Goblin, but he can be forgiven that, because he reminisces correctly about his victory as a 16-year-old lad over Saladin's forces at the Battle of Montgisard.</p> <h2>War</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336790045\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/kingdom005.jpg\" alt=\"The Crusades in Kingdom of Heaven\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some passable scenes ... the Crusades in Kingdom of Heaven. Photograph: Kobal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hawkish fundies Reynald de Ch\u00e2tillon and Guy de Lusignan try to start a war with the Saracens at Kerak. But it becomes a bit of a washout when the Green Goblin has a friendly chat with Saladin, and everyone decides to calm down and go home. If only more of the Crusades could have been settled with a friendly chat. The real Saladin backed down from a fight at Kerak because his armies were called away to defend Egypt. By this point, the movie is far too busy trying to draw tiresome parallels between Reynald de Ch\u00e2tillon and Donald Rumsfeld to show anything so interesting as an actual battle.</p> <h2>Dialogue</h2> <p>\"I once fought for two days with an arrow through my testicle.\" A proud boast, but implausible. However badass twelfth-century warriors may have been, an arrow lodged in one's testicle from any angle makes it extremely difficult to walk.</p> <h2>Violence</h2> <p>Following the king's death, Guy accedes to the throne of Jerusalem. He meets Saladin to negotiate. Saladin offers him a cup of water filled with precious ice, which Guy dismissively hands to Reynald. 'I did not give you the cup,' snarls Saladin. He whips out a curved dagger and slashes Reynald's throat, spraying blood all over the tent. Factually, this scene is spot on. But the brief moment of genuine historical thrill does little to quicken the pulse. Even the actors look bored.</p> <h2>More war</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336790046\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/kingdom002.jpg\" alt=\"Saladin's armies approach Jerusalem in Kingdom of Heaven\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saladin's armies mass digitally outside Jerusalem ... Kingdom of Heaven. Photograph: Kobal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Saladin's forces assemble digitally outside Jerusalem, Balian rallies the inhabitants for a last stand. What isn't shown is that the real Balian of Ibelin only ended up in Jerusalem by mistake, while he was in the process of doing a runner. Far from being a hero, he tried to weasel out of defending the city. In the film, Balian and Saladin sort things out with another friendly chat. In reality, Balian's behaviour was disgraceful, threatening that he would murder 5000 Muslim slaves and torch the Dome of the Rock and the Mosque al-Aqsa unless Saladin let him surrender.</p> <h2>Religion</h2> <p>Saladin enters Jerusalem and, walking through a church, picks up a fallen crucifix and reverently replaces it. Some western audiences scoffed, but this scene is justified. Saladin's victory is renowned as one of the most honourable in history.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336790047\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/kingdom004.jpg\" alt=\"Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven\" width=\"140\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Washed up on a Syrian beach ...

But it is hampered by its desire to show that, apart from a few bad apples, Crusaders and Saracens were all moderate, tolerant and jolly reasonable chaps. The message: war is bad, and most Muslims are not villains. Admirable sentiments, but ones that are difficult to take seriously coming from the director of Black Hawk Down. The Crusades were never this dull.</p>",
  "<p>There was a joke going round the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Climate Camp</a> in the last days. As well as the \"wellbeing tent\", which dealt with mildly traumatised activists on the receiving end of 5am police batons, someone proposed a \"wellmeaning\" tent. It would accommodate those who'd like to include state and capitalism-based solutions in the movement to reverse climate change. The camp's outer fence would curve into the wellmeaning tent to create a round-table for stakeholders including the police (successfully kept out of the site after days of stand-offs), E.ON UK and other energy industry representatives \u2013 tea and hand-wringing optional.</p> <p>The joke was prompted by a controversial presentation by George Monbiot, in which he endorsed the use of the state as a partner in resolving the climate crisis. Monbiot held the audience rapt as he explained the fundamental incompatibility of economic growth with the emission cuts needed to avert catastrophic climate change. Yet he confessed not knowing where to turn next to solve the issues of how to generate the changes necessary to shift our sources of energy, production and consumption, and where the state and capitalism fit in. He ended by endorsing the use of the state: \"By God, let's use it\". Amid the applause, some were appalled. Let me explain why.</p> <p>Many of the organisers of the climate camps honed their skills in the anti-roads movement of the mid-1990s. Some came from the traveller, squatter and free party communities, an alliance of resistance built up to counter the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994\">Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994</a>, which criminalised travellers and activists reclaiming land and buildings for social, cooperative use. These activists came from a culture of anti-authoritarian anti-capitalism \u2013 rejecting the property ladder and the commodification of living space, and embracing collective enjoyment, dance and music.</p> <p>The continuum of this culture of resistance, of a struggle for a commons, for control over one's own and one's family's life, for non-alienated labour and social interaction, stretches back to the <a href=\"http://libcom.org/history/articles/diggers-levellers-1642-52/\">Diggers, Levellers</a> and the Luddites \u2013 English radicals struggling against the monarchy, taxes, land enclosure and austerity measures designed to empower a new industrial class, funded by a feudal and colonial land-grab and slavery.</p> <p>This historical memory, and these beliefs in a global commons, in leaderless, participative organising and grassroots anti-state and anti-capitalist action run deep through the camps. They're also informed by a culture of direct action and a refusal to accept top-down solutions and a system of parliamentary democracy that reduces participation in politics to 16 \"X\"s in a box in an average lifetime.</p> <p>But did <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ib29WamKmU&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=1F2D4DCC56E3A7C4&amp;index=62\">Scargill</a> and <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2000/06/09/about-george-monbiot/\">Monbiot</a> really \"get\" the camp and its cultures of resistance? The latest edition of the NUM's newsletter criticised the camp for being too middle-class, anti-miner, and alienated from \"real\", genuine working class \"realities\". Are these representations fair? Many participants in the camp could be defined as the \"precariat\" \u2013 neoliberalism's answer to the proletariat. No longer an urbanised worker in a regular job in for a majority of their working life, the precariat lives and works in a precarious state, at the mercy of a deregulated labour market. Work is dominated by casualisation, flexible and migrant labour, zero-hour contracts, temping, seasonal work, home working, self-employment and unemployment. Many at the camp form a part of this working class, no more in the control of the means of production than energy industry workers here or China or Poland.</p> <p>State solutions to the climate crisis were presented to us 10 years ago through the Kyoto protocol \u2013 what were they? To privatise the air we breathe and turn carbon emissions into commodities, to buy and sell atmospheric poison, to create a new market of trading in the means of ecological destruction. It's no wonder many at the camp reject state solutions to climate change.</p> <p>Entertaining as the two-minutes-in-a-room-full-of-poison <a href=\"http://greenmansoccasional.blogspot.com/2008/08/scargill-and-monbiot-debate-coal-and.html\">standoff</a> between Monbiot and Scargill is, this gesture politics isn't getting to the heart of the fight. The question is, who and under what conditions, controls decision-making, and has climate-changing power? Who will pay the price of exile from family and common land, water and food insecurity, as land and rivers become polluted or diverted into the energy industry's use, for bauxite, uranium, coal, and iron-ore to build new infrastructure, power nuclear energy, expand the global coal market and concomitant infrastructure to perpetuate the whole process?</p> <p>How do we bring about a transformation which empowers us all? Grassroots organising in cooperative, low-impact, sustainable ways, glimpsed at the Climate Camp, and practised daily by millions, is one way towards this. Another is to live at the sharpest end of climate chaos today.</p> <p>So how about this for a challenge, George and Arthur? Spend two months, not two minutes, (together!) living in Matlu Camp in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharsuguda\">Jharsuguda</a>, in Orissa province, India. One of the poorest states on earth, here in the heart of India's coal belt, are families displaced by mining, living in a polluted form of captivity. Where our very own Department for International Development has been restructuring governance, reinforcing the mining industries, and guiding land reforms allowing for the felling of pristine forest, more tribal resettlement and more environmental destruction.</p> <p>Changing our sources of energy without changing our sources of economic and political power will not make a difference. Neither coal nor nuclear are the \"solution\", we need a revolution.</p>",
  "<p><br>Castles Made of Sand, anyone? ... if not Hendrix, what else washes up? Photograph: Michael Wildsmith/Getty</p> <p>Wow, what a summer, I wish they could all be like this. I'm sitting outside in the blazing sunshine, sipping Pepsi-Cola through a paper straw, marvelling at the pink and grey paving stones, which almost match the colours of my swimming trunks, and enjoying the popular song piping through the Tannoy to sweeten the afternoon air... <a href=\"http://www.mp3lyrics.org/d/dawn/what-are-you-doing-sunday/\">What Are You Doing Sunday Baby - Gee I Want to Marry You</a>. I love that song...My sister teases me that one day I'll get married ... what a horrible idea, she's insane. Eventually, mum and dad will come out of the pub - hopefully bearing ice-cream cornets, and take my awful sister and me for some fun on the beach.</p> <p>You might have gathered by now that the events I'm describing did not take place recently. We're talking 1970 here - Selsey Bill - another world. A shingle beach, wet sand, a caravan, toilet blocks, disinfectant, penny arcades, and each evening, hokey cokey in the The Embassy club - which my family do not take part in.</p> <p>As this summer is non-existent, I've stuck my head into the past - it was either that or the gas oven, and like the character <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c0_rebours\">Des Esseintes in Au Rebours</a>, my travels, though imaginary, are brought to life with the sensual stimuli of music, ice cream and fizzy drinks - the latter of course now replaced by red wine. The music of childhood holidays is so evocative that to hear it once again brings all the joys and misery of le temps perdu flooding back - and its carbon footprint is negligible. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-LdEx-eaw0&amp;feature=related\">Edison Lighthouse's Love Grows Where my Rosemary Grows</a> is a particular trigger - and how stupid of me to miss their headlining slot at the 2008 <a href=\"http://www.british-naturism.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_ID=346\">British Naturist Summer Nudefest</a>.</p> <p>Advancing through the coal-blackened ether of austerity Britain, I arrive at <a href=\"http://www.polperro.org/\">Polperro 1977</a>.
