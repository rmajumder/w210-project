  "<p>Democrats are increasingly confident that the US congressional election on Tuesday will see them extend their majority in the House of Representatives and reduce the Republicans in the Senate to an ineffective rump. Polls today suggest that the Democrats stand to take not only the White House, but will win seven or eight more seats in the Senate, where they already hold 51 of the 100 seats.</p> <p>A Congressional victory on that scale would help Barack Obama to avoid the fate of some of his predecessors, whose legislative plans have often been blocked by hostile Republicans.</p> <p>The Democrats, fighting the congressional race with almost as much intensity as the White House battle, poured millions of dollars into the campaign at the weekend. Obama diverted some of his funds into key Senate and House races in places such as Georgia. Democrats in Senate races had spent more than $67m, against $33.7m by the Republican candidates, as of the end of last week.</p> <p>Despite Congress reaching levels of unpopularity that rival that of President George Bush, voters surveyed by pollsters blamed the economic crisis on Republicans, rather than Democrats, who seem likely to hang on to the gains they achieved in the 2006 mid-term elections. The Democrats may fall just short of the 60 Senate seats needed to prevent the Republicans mounting legislation-blocking tactics such as filibustering.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia, said the Democrats should not become hung up on the 60 figure, and that it would not matter if they failed to reach it. \"The Republicans who are left are going to be irrelevant for the first year of the Obama administration. The Republicans will not have a major role to play,\" he said.</p> <p>He said the concentration on reaching the 60 mark was overdone, because some moderate Republican senators would probably vote with the Democrats, or face trouble being re-elected.</p> <p>Another potential problem facing a Republican rump, according to the political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, is that it could be more conservative than the existing Republican Senate group. According to their analysis, the Republicans most at risk of losing their seat are mainly those on the more moderate wing. A more rightwing Senate grouping might find it harder to attract voters from the centre ground in the congressional mid-term elections in 2010.</p> <p>The three Senate seats most likely to switch from the Republicans to the Democrats on Tuesday are Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado. Others the Democrats hope to take include Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Oregon.</p> <p>One of the biggest victims of a Democratic rout in the Senate could be Elizabeth Dole, the conservative senator for North Carolina. Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent in Minnesota who famously clashed with the British parliamentarian George Galloway at a Senate hearing on Iraq, is facing a close race against the Democratic candidate, the comedian Al Franken.</p> <p>To reach the filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate, the Democrats will need to take Georgia, Kentucky or Mississippi. That is mainly why Obama announced last Friday that he would begin advertising in Georgia. The state may prove beyond him, but the big turn-out of African-Americans in the state, attracted by his candidacy, offers an outside chance of a Senate upset.</p> <p>In the races for the House of Representatives, where the Democrats have held control since 2006, the party is expecting to extend its lead by a further 25-plus seats.</p>",
  "<p>Attempts by Gordon Brown to enlist banks in softening conditions for families and businesses suffered a setback yesterday when one of the country's most senior bankers travelling on the prime minister's own trip said his company was unlikely to pass on to customers the full effects of future interest rate cuts.<br> David Hodgkinson, chief operating officer at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hsbcholdings\">HSBC</a> and one of 27 business leaders on the four-stop tour of the Gulf, said yesterday that even if the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England's monetary policy committee</a> (MPC) was to reduce interest rates on Thursday, the effect would not be \"linear\".<br> Brown will be infuriated with both the content and timing of Hodgkinson's comments since the banker's interview broke moments before the prime minister delivered the key note speech of his four-day trip to the Gulf. Addressing a conference in Abu Dhabi, Brown laid out his five-point plan for the G20 meeting in Washington. He also restated the expectations the government now had of banks after it intervened to save three of the UK's biggest with \u00a337bn of public money. Brown said: \"Having helped to strengthen the global banking system through recapitalisation, governments must ensure that the money is used to enable a resumption of lending to families and businesses.\" HSBC is Europe's largest bank and has 3% of the 11m mortgages sold in the UK. Hodgkinson's remarks represent the first time a senior businessman has so clearly articulated the thinking of the banking sector. In an interview Hodgkinson said: \"As an adjustment process that is taking place, clearly if interest rates are down significantly the rates for borrowing will go down but I am not going to say it is absolutely linear, because it depends on the particular [situation] and the risk.\" He said he expected there to be some \"stickiness\" should the Bank of England's monetary policy committee cut rates. However, the activity of banks in the past month indicates many may share Hodgkinson's thinking. Though the MPC carried out an emergency rate cut of half a percentage point last month, only half of banks have cut their standard variable rates. The website moneyfacts.co.uk also revealed that 82% of lenders had not passed on the full 1% cut from the past three base rate cuts and 57% of lenders passed on just half or less of the last three base rate cuts. The businessman was immediately slapped down by the prime minister's official spokesman who said that should official rates be cut, consumers could expect to see full benefits. A government spokesman said: \"The prime minister is very clear that we are taking the action to ensure that more mortgage holders and small businesses feel the benefit.\" The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/regulators\">Financial Services Authority</a> recently said repossession rates had risen by 71% as householders struggled to meet rising bills. In the April to June quarter, repossessions had risen to over 11,000 from about 6,500 in April. In September mortgage lending fell 10% to its lowest level in more than three years, thought in part to be down to the difficulties first-time buyers were having in obtaining finance.<br> Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/30/interest-rates-us-economy\">the US federal reserve cut rates by half a percentage point</a> and it was expected that the MPC would make a half percentage point cut this week, with some holding out for a full 1% cut. Interest rates in the UK currently stand at 4.5%.<br> Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said it was difficult to see the justification for not passing on the full benefit of any cut. </p> <p>\"Banks are only too happy to increase the cost of lending when interest rates go up,\" he said. \"For customers to get a fair deal, this needs to be a two-way street.<br> \"When the whole banking industry owes so much to taxpayers for their very survival, any bank will find itself on very thin ice if it is found to be unfairly profiteering from its customers. \"As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\"> credit crunch</a> continues to keep millions of customers and small businesses in a stranglehold, borrowers need interest rate cuts now.\"<br> In a speech to the Saudi chamber of commerce Brown praised the delegation of businessmen on his trip, saying their collected wealth was $400bn and calling them the \"highest profile trade delegation\".</p>",
  "<p>On the last full day of campaigning, the candidates for the US presidency are making a mad dash across the country in an effort to energise their supporters and win over undecided voters.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republican</a> nominee, is visiting seven cities in seven states - including his home state of Arizona, in a reflection of his lagging position in the polls. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>'s schedule is lighter only by comparison: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/democrats\">Democrat</a> is visiting three tough battleground states where polls show him ahead but too close for comfort.</p> <p>McCain is fighting in part for the roughly 4-9% of the electorate who polls show still have not chosen a candidate, even as the presidential campaign nears two years old. </p> <p>\"My friends, it's official: There's just one day left until we take America in a new direction,\" McCain told a raucous, heavily Hispanic rally in Miami just after midnight.</p> <p>The Arizona senator's campaign manager, Rick Davis, told reporters last night that those holdouts could prove decisive for a McCain victory. </p> <p>\"If Barack Obama hasn't closed the deal with them after two years in the campaign and a year as the nominee of their party, maybe they're holding out for a good reason,\" he said <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15193.html\">according to the Politico</a>. </p> <p>\"Now, maybe they just decided not to vote and they don't want to say that because everyone they know is voting. So we'll see. If we see the vote drop below 130 million, you'll know they didn't show up. If it goes over you'll know they came out, [and] I think that's a good chance for us to win.\" In 2004, 124 million Americans cast ballots. </p> <p>Obama, meanwhile, told radio talk show host Russ Parr that he was feeling \"peaceful\". \"The question is going to be who wants it more,\" he said. \"And I hope that our supporters want it bad, because I think the country needs it.\"</p> <p>By Saturday, 24 million had already voted in this year's race, with the Democrats apparently gaining an advantage, according to an analysis by Michael McDonald, an associate professor of government and politics at George Mason University. </p> <p>The exact results of the early vote will not be known until election day, but according to party registration statistics early voters in several key states have been predominantly Democrats. In Florida, for instance, of the 4.1m votes cast early, 45.5% have been by registered Democrats, 38% by Republicans and 17% other.</p> <p>Today's polls show Barack Obama well positioned for victory. He leads in every state John Kerry won in 2004, and is ahead deep into the territory won by George Bush that year. National polls show Obama leading by about seven percentage points.</p> <p>McCain's heavy travel schedule today reflects his effort to defend Republican turf against Obama's surge. Of the seven states he hits today, only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a> voted Democrat in 2004. He will also stop in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>, Tennessee, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/indiana\">Indiana</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/newmexico\">New Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nevada\">Nevada</a> and Arizona. The latter is his home state, where Obama has pulled close behind him in the polls and has run advertisements.</p> <p>Obama is to hold rallies in Florida, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia\">Virginia</a>, three states won twice by Bush. North Carolina and Virginia have long been in Republican hands, but polls show Obama is poised to retake them.</p> <p>The vice-presidential candidates have similarly exhausting schedules today. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> will be in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, Missouri, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iowa\">Iowa</a>, Colorado and Nevada, all states that Bush won in 2004. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> will campaign in Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>",
  "<p>There can be few more astonishing confessions in modern politics than the prime minister's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/03/gordon-brown-gateway-data-security\">admission on Sunday</a> that the government is unable to guarantee the security of our personal information on the state's databases. This admission shatters all the previous claims that the government has made that its obsession with creating vast databases can in any way improve the safety and security of the citizen.</p> <p>Of course, he had little choice. Since the government first proposed the mother of all these databases, the ID card register, barely a month has passed without some monstrous data loss. It started with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/nov/20/economy.personalfinancenews\">25m tax credit records</a>, went through innumerable lost laptop computers, included everybody from civil servants to ministers leaving records in trains, pubs and restaurants, and concluded this week with a lost flash drive compromising the security of the government's entire Gateway system. Soldiers' lives, our bank account, tax, passport and driving licence details, even the addresses of children, have all been compromised by these failures.</p> <p>When the government first proposed the ID card and its associated all-singing, all-dancing database, the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/passports-and-immigration/id-cards/how-the-data-will-be-used/\">national identity register</a>, many of us thought they were naive. In particular, we thought there was a serious strategic weakness at the heart of the idea, a flaw known colloquially as the \"honey pot problem\".</p> <p>This is a recurrent problem with large databases that contain valuable data. Because they are so valuable, they attract the malevolent attention of large numbers of hackers, fraudsters, criminals and even terrorists. Under sustained attack, even such sophisticated organisations as Microsoft and the Pentagon have succumbed, so what chance the Home Office?</p> <p>Even the governments' fiercest critics, however, assumed a basic level of competence on the part of the government; an assumption that now looks seriously flawed.</p> <p>Perhaps we should have known better. As well as the honey pot problem, there is another difficulty that applies to these vast government databases. To do their job, these databases have to be accessible to many people. Whether it is the NHS database, the various children's databases, or the national identity register, they can only work if they have thousands of access points. If the government cannot protect one laptop or one flash drive, what chance a system with over ten thousand terminals?</p> <p>When we were first discussing the ID card system with the senior police officers with most responsibility for the system, l asked them what plans they had to deal with anybody using virus programmes to compromise the system. It was embarrassing. They did not have the first idea. Indeed, up until that point, they had clearly not even realised that such a possibility existed.</p> <p>And there lies the difficulty. Faced with intractable problems with political pressure for a solution, the government reaches for a headline grabbing high-tech \"solution\". Rather than spend the resources, time and thought necessary to get a real answer, they naively grasp solutions that to the technologically illiterate ministers look like magic. And most ministers are very illiterate about any serious technology.</p> <p>So what we get is a form of magic, but one that is of most use to the dark side of our society. Many of us have worried about the state deliberately misusing the vast quantities of data that they hold on us. That problem is still there. But perhaps it will turn out that the biggest threat to our society in these enormous databases is that the government will be the unwitting, indeed witless, accomplice, to every hacker, fraudster, sexual predator, criminal or terrorist that would like easy access to all our details. That, far from protecting us all against identity theft, the state, with its grandiose projects, will be its biggest facilitator.</p>",
  "<p>The unfathomably brutal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/congo-unitednations-miliband\">civil war devastating the eastern Congo</a>, which is now reaching yet another peak of savagery, is not really about Congo. It is the continuation of the civil war and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/flash/0,,1181893,00.html\">genocide</a> that shattered neighbouring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/rwanda\">Rwanda</a> in the early 1990s.</p> <p>This war should be fought inside Rwanda. Pillage, mass murder, systematic rape, forced recruitment of boys as soldiers and girls as sex slaves \u2013 it should all be happening in Rwanda. The reason it isn't is that Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, has managed to build a security-oriented state that allows Rwandans to live in peace.</p> <p>Many outsiders find the Congo war, with its baffling array of factions and staggering human toll \u2013 3 or 4 million deaths over the last decade \u2013 almost impossible to understand. But understanding it becomes much easier when it is placed in its Rwandan context.</p> <p>Over a 100-day period in mid-1994, murderers loyal to the Hutu-dominated government of Rwanda slaughtered about 1 million of their Tutsi neighbours. After Kagame's rebel movement overthrew that government, the killers fled into a safe zone created by France, which was the genocidal regime's close ally. France then arranged for the defeated army and its mass of civilian accomplices \u2013 more than a million people \u2013 to cross into eastern Congo, along with their artillery pieces, helicopters and other heavy weaponry.</p> <p>Over the next few years, gangs of genocidaires crossed back repeatedly into Rwanda, waging a brutal insurgency aimed at retaking power so they could complete the genocide. The Rwandan army, led by Kagame, ruthlessly crushed this insurgency. Rwandan forces then invaded Congo twice, killing many genocidaires and overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko, the Congolese president and monster who had embraced their cause.</p> <p>But the genocidal force, now called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Forces_for_the_Liberation_of_Rwanda\">Forces Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda</a>, or FDLR, was not destroyed. Unable to push into Rwanda and kill Tutsi there, it <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/2008/may/16/congo.rwanda\">decided to wage war in eastern Congo</a>. Many Tutsi also live there, and they are the victims of a new genocide in the making.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, this effort to wipe out Congolese Tutsi has provoked a response. A former general in the Congolese army who is of Tutsi descent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/congo1\">Laurent Nkunda</a>, has raised an army to fight the genocidaires and try to prevent the extermination of his people. This conflict is at the heart of what is happening in the long-suffering Congolese provinces of North and South Kivu.</p> <p>Nkunda's army has itself been accused of atrocities, and given the record of rampaging warlords in eastern Congo, that accusation is almost certainly true. More intriguing is the charge that Nkunda is receiving secret support from Kagame and his Tutsi-led government in Rwanda. Kagame denies this, but when he sent troops into Congo in 1996 he also denied he was doing it, only to confess after victory a couple of years later.</p> <p>There are several good reasons why Kagame's government would want to help Nkunda. First, Nkunda is trying to stop the slaughter of Kagame's ethnic Tutsi cousins in Congo. Second, his troops are killing fighters whose ultimate aim is to invade Rwanda and wipe out the Tutsi population there. Third, a victory by Nkunda might allow him to establish a buffer zone inside Congo that would make a genocidaire invasion of Rwanda more difficult.</p> <p>Another reason cannot be ignored. Eastern Congo is one of the most resource-rich regions in the world. For more than a century, kings, presidents, gangsters, warlords, business tycoons and others have understood that control of this region brings the prospect of great wealth. That too is one of the factors fuelling this war. If there were no gold or diamonds in eastern Congo, or if companies like Microsoft and Hitachi were not so desperate for the \"grey gold\" known as coltan, a key component in cell phones and other electronic devices that is plentiful in this region, controlling it would not be so appealing.</p> <p>Under Kagame's authoritarian rule, Rwanda has become one of the most promising countries in Africa. All it would take to destroy the progress Rwanda has made over the last decade would be a handful of successful cross-border attacks by genocidaires. Kagame knows this, and he is not the sort of person to allow the niceties of international law to prevent him from aggressively defending Rwanda's security. Supporting a friendly warlord in Congo might be the best way for him to do that. If that warlord establishes control over a territory full of riches, so much the better for them both.</p> <p>One intriguing question remains: Would Nkunda's capture of eastern Congo and its main town, Goma, bring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/31/congo-unitednations\">a measure of peace</a> to the region? If so, regardless of what else it would mean, it would be a godsend.</p>",

  "<p>As a UN supply convoy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/congo-rwanda\">arrived today</a> in rebel-controlled territory in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congo\">Congo</a>, aid agencies were working flat out to resume their own efforts disrupted by recent fighting.</p> <p>Relief work was halted last week in and around Goma, where thousands of refugees had fled after fighting broke out between rebels and government forces.</p> <p>But today, as a tentative ceasefire held, aid workers were beginning to plan how to get assistance to those in need, both inside Goma, which is close to the Rwanda border, and in the refugee camps just outside the city's perimeter.</p> <p>Rebecca Wynn, of Oxfam, said she had just returned from the Kibati camps just north of Goma.</p> <p>\"People's basic needs are being met, there are latrines and water pumps, but a lot of work needs to be done, particularly with drainage,\" she said, explaining that aid work could be halted at any time.</p> <p>\"It's still tense. There is a ceasefire, but that ceasefire could break. There's still a real need for other countries to keep piling on the diplomatic pressure.\"</p> <p>People living in banana leaf and tarpaulin shelters inside the camp had spoken mainly of wanting an end to the violence, said Wynn, whose organisation has four foreign and about 40 local staff in Goma, plus others elsewhere around the country.</p> <p>\"There is a need for aid, but moreso for security. People are telling us, 'we want to go home',\" she said.</p> <p>Anjali Kwatra, of ActionAid, said the organisation was resuming work around Goma after ceasing activities last week as the situation spiraled \"out of control\".</p> <p>\"Things seem to be getting calmer but we are relying on the UN's advice on security,\" she said.</p> <p>\"If it stays calmer then we have the people in place, we have supplies in the warehouses. We can get it out to people in Goma and camps around the city pretty quickly, but it all depends on the security situation. There are a lot of people who need help.\"</p> <p>Security remains key, said Louise Orton from another UK-based aid agency, Merlin.</p> <p>\"For us, access is really important, that we can get our health workers out there to deliver the help,\" she told BBC News 24.</p>",
  "<p>The polls in Seattle, Washington, are closed and a Diebold AccuVote electronic voting machine is chattering its way through the results. Votes cast using its touchscreen ballot have been captured on an encrypted memory card and duplicated on a continuous printed paper roll.</p> <p>So has the city chosen Senator McCain (Republican) or Senator Obama (Democrat) for president? Neither, as it happens. The only votes recorded on this AccuVote for the highest office in the land are for one Mark Harris (Independent).</p> <p>Fortunately for America, this is only my test run of voting technology that will be used for real by around a third of US voters tomorrow. But before Americans rejoice at their narrow escape from four years' rule by a technology writer, they might want to listen to Dan Wallach, associate professor of computer science at Rice University in Texas.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/pub/texas-house-elections25june08.pdf\">Wallach conducted an in-depth review of the Diebold AccuVote for Californian election officials</a> (PDF) and discovered its software was littered with vulnerabilities.</p> <p>\"We found all kinds of problems,\" he says, \"Our study showed that you only need to apply an evil software patch \u2014 forcing the machine to swap votes between candidates \u2014 to a single machine, and you can arrange for that patch to spread to every machine in the system. It takes a relatively modest effort to corrupt every voting machine in the county.\"<br> The study found similar vulnerabilities with voting machines from two other manufacturers, leading California's secretary of state to <a href=\"http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting_systems/ttbr/diebold.pdf\">withdraw her approval for all three devices</a> (PDF).</p> <p>Nevertheless, these machines will be used by millions of voters across the country on election day. \"There are no nationwide legal requirements for electronic voting machines. They vary from state to state and even from county to county,\" explains Professor Edward Felten, director of the center for information technology policy at Princeton University. \"Even for states that follow federal guidelines, its testing and certification processes have lots of problems.\"</p> <p>These problems are starting to be revealed by early voting in some states. Voters in West Virginia, Texas and Tennessee have reported electronic \"vote flipping\", where their touchscreen selections flip unexpectedly to rival candidates. It seems particularly prevalent where 'straight ticket' selection of the entire ballot along party lines is allowed. (A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aBaX9GPSaQ\">video by the makers of the Simpsons about such flipping</a> has gone viral.)</p> <p>This is probably not an organised attempt to defraud voters, according to Wallach: \"If the machines were maliciously flipping candidates, you wouldn't be seeing it on screen, it would be happening silently behind the display. It's most likely poor programming, user confusion and calibration errors.\"</p> <p>When mass voting starts, more such bugs are bound to emerge. During the presidential primary elections earlier this year, thousands of votes were erroneously switched or lost entirely when software and hardware errors affected machines from South Carolina and Florida to Ohio and even Washington DC.</p> <p>Ironically, electronic voting was originally adopted in an effort to reform problems with archaic punch-card and lever machines. These were responsible for the <a href=\"http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards/chad.html\">infamous \"hanging chads\"</a> that helped swing the close-run presidential elections in 2000 in favour of George Bush.</p> <p>In 2002, the House and Senate passed the Help America Vote Act, which gave states $3.8bn (\u00a32.4bn) to modernise voting technology and improve access for the disabled. Individual states chose different technologies, some of which have proved more secure and reliable than others.</p> <p>\"There seems to be an inherent problem with any system that keeps only electronic records,\" says Professor Felten. \"It makes it very difficult for election officials and voters to verify their votes.\" Twelve states currently use paperless electronic voting machines, and 16 more have been judged by the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice to offer \"inadequate\" post-election manual audits.</p> <p>Both Felten and Wallach are calling for voting machine manufacturers to make their software open source, as is already the case in Australia's Capital Territory. \"Revealing source code should be mandatory,\" says Wallach. \"It's really important for transparency and it doesn't reduce security.\"</p> <p>Wallach is also working on a next-generation voting machine called VoteBox that uses sophisticated cryptographic techniques to allow voters to challenge whether machines are recording their votes correctly.</p> <p>\"The technology to build a fundamentally better machine is available today,\" he says. \"But it's unclear whether there is the money to develop it. The Help America Vote Act gave a one-time deluge of cash to upgrade systems. When the money runs out, we're heading back to paper.\"</p> <p>Wallach's predictions appear to be coming true. Alaska, California, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Tennessee and New Mexico are ditching electronic voting machines and this election will see a decrease in their numbers nationwide for the first time.</p> <p>The only technology growing in popularity is optical scan voting, which combines a simple paper ballot with uncomplicated computer scanners. Almost 100 million American voters will vote via optical scanning tomorrow \u2014 around 50 million more than by touchscreen.</p> <p>Washington state is going one step further. When my Diebold AccuVote is packed up at 8pm on November 4, its memory card and paper roll carefully dispatched to the voting depot, Seattle's polling stations will close their doors for the last time \u2014 because Washington state is moving to a vote-by-mail system for all future elections.</p> <p>It's a sure solution for electronic voting fraud. But now I can't help wondering: exactly how secure is my postman?</p>",
  "<p>When discussing the Senate races in the United States this year, one question looms large on the mind of any political analyst or junkie. Namely, will the Democrats or won't they? Get to 60 votes, that is.</p> <p>The figure 60 is \u2013 outside of gaining a simple majority (of 51 votes) \u2013 the second-most important number to shoot for in the Senate. This is because a procedure known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster\">filibuster</a>, in the past used when the minority found legislation so offensive that they were willing to get up and talk, talk and talk some more, is now employed by Republican minority leader and legislation constipator Mitch McConnell more often than Sarah Palin can say \"You betcha!\". To stop this verbal assault requires a \"supermajority\" or 60 votes. Hence, it is a magic number of sorts.</p> <p>When this election season began, prognosticators of all stripes believed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economic malaise</a>, an unpopular war in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgebush\">Republican president</a> in the White House with an approval rating on par with scurvy, made Democratic pickups the most likely outcome. When five Republican senators decided to retire and Democrats raised a lot more money than their Republican counterparts, Democratic chances were only enhanced. And every day brings seemingly worse news for the GOP.</p> <p>Currently, short of a damaging event on the level of a natural disaster \u2013 or a public endorsement by Madonna \u2013 Democrats are poised to gain at least six seats. Right now, in Virginia, New Mexico, Colorado, New Hampshire, Alaska and Oregon the die has been cast. As Democrats effectively now have 51 seats in the senate (by including the two independents who caucus with the Democrats \u2013 Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont), that would mean they need three more to get to 60. Currently, comedian Al Franken is slightly ahead of Republican incumbent and used-car salesman impersonator Norm Coleman in Minnesota, and the Democrats are also in position to beat former Republican cabinet member and wife of 1996 GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole, North Carolina Senator Liddy Dole. That gets you to 59.</p> <p>Yet, in three more races in the South \u2013 Mississippi, Georgia and Kentucky (McConnell's seat) \u2013 the polls show a dead heat. Meanwhile in Maine, Democrat Tom Allen is gaining on election-year moderate Susan Collins. In the Georgia race, as a special bonus, if nobody gets 50% (quite likely with a Libertarian candidate also running), then a runoff will be set for a month later, or the beginning of December.</p> <p>So if you think all the drama might be done election night, just imagine one more month of fun, especially if the Democrats are standing at 59 seats on November 5. This would prove my theory, which is that American electioneering never does in fact end. </p> <p>In any case, November 4 should be a very good night for the Democrats. And Republicans? Well, they may find themselves looking up the definition of <a href=\"http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Hari-kiri\">hari-kiri</a>.</p>",

  "<p>There's plenty to see though the windows of La Masia, the Catalan farmhouse that stands proudly alongside the Camp Nou, dwarfed by the city that's grown around it - home to future generations of players, a kind of footballing indoctrination centre in all things Bar\u00e7a that's housed 493 players. Caught between life and death, there's the maternity hospital on one side and the crematorium on the other. Then there's the stadium itself; the tiny, soon-to-be abandoned training pitch in the shadow of its concrete stands, eye-holes ripped from the screens protecting players' intimacy; and the assorted streetlife gathering as night falls, not so much protecting its intimacy as selling it - from women to men to both.</p> <p>But while David Beckham recalls a trip to La Masia spent watching the \"other lads\" hanging out the windows whistling at prostitutes, Andres Iniesta only had eyes for one man: Josep Guardiola i Sala. When Iniesta was a little lad plucked from the tiny town of Fuentealbilla, he plastered Pep Guardiola's picture all over the walls by his Masia bunk bed. And who could blame him?</p> <p>After all, Guardiola won six leagues, a European Cup and an Olympic gold. He claimed he would have been a Third Division player if it hadn't been for Johan Cruyff but became the focal point of the emblematic, mould-breaking Dream Team that racked up four successive league titles; the metronome that kept them ticking over, constantly moving the ball on with a single touch; the man Atl\u00e9tico Madrid striker Kiko described in a word: \"pam\". \"Pam-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam\". No wonder Iniesta Blu-Tack'd him up. Born in Santpedor, schooled 100 metres from Camp Nou, a former ball-boy and La Masia resident, intelligent and engaging, a charismatic and eloquent defender of a Catalan and footballing identity, club captain and a model whose legacy survives in players like Xavi, Iniesta, and Cesc, Pep couldn't have been more of a hero.</p> <p>Only he could and now, suddenly, he is. Because although he's the youngest coach in <em>primera</em>, much as he's losing his hair and losing weight - his staff complain that he rarely stops to eat from the tupperware tubs he takes in every day - Guardiola has proven that not only was he a unique player, he's an impressive coach. Suddenly the Catalan press that complained at losing Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is falling over itself to proclaim the \"Pep Team\" - \"Pep's Dream Boys\" was that little bit too ridiculous, even for them - the greatest thing in the whole wide world ever. Even the Madrid press is impressed, Marca's Miguel Serrano declaring: \"If I was a kid now, my dad would have a hell of a job stopping me supporting Barcelona. The Pep Team's too late because you can change house, job, wife, political party and even your sex, but not your football team, yet when they play it's glorious.\"</p> <p>Guardiola's done it with a commitment to Barcelona's ball-playing style and emotional roots: in one match in October, eight of their starting XI were youth team products and still they won. Which is what they do most weeks. In fact, it's what they've now done every week for seven weeks, hitting six past Sporting, five past Atl\u00e9tico and Almer\u00eda and four more past M\u00e1laga this weekend, racking up 28 in nine league games - on course for the 107 set by John Toshack's Real Madrid in 1989-90. For some, this latest success was the best. A 4-1 victory against the odds on a surface more swimming pool than perfect pitch - even after four blokes attacked it with giant hairdryers. The kind of surface that, Captain Caveman Carles Puyol and hyperactive child Dani Alves apart, shouldn't have suited them. A 4-1 victory against a side that had won four on the trot, secured with spirit and practicality and even Guardiola admitting, \"I told the players to hoof it.\" One that had every single bloody paper \"Singing in the Rain\", likening Xavi to Gene Kelly and, oddly, Fred Astaire; one, more importantly, that had them declaring: \"it's games like this that win leagues\".</p> <p>Especially when they coincide with Valencia and Sevilla losing and Madrid rounding off a disastrous week in which Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n fended off allegations of corruption and the team couldn't fend off a Second Division B side, by drawing 1-1 at Almer\u00eda. Because those results carried Barcelona top for the first time since May 2007 when they took the first <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/05/14/gone_in_60_seconds_barcelonas.html\" title=\"\">of two</a> easy steps <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/06/11/barcas_title_gone_in_18_second.html\" title=\"\">to blow the title</a>.</p> <p>\"The secret,\" says Guardiola, \"is that Barcelona have fantastic players.\" \"The secret,\" counters one insider, \"is that Bar\u00e7a have two things they didn't have last season: hunger and a coach.\" After all, the vast majority of Barcelona's players were there last year too, and they finished third - 18 points behind Madrid <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/05/08/madrid_take_the_pasillo_out_of.html\" title=\"\">and utterly humiliated</a>. There was no professionalism, no work, no togetherness; now, at last, there is. The complacency has gone, with Guardiola bringing huge energy. Last season, as he guided Barcelona B to the Second Division B title in his debut season as a coach, he believed that, such was the talent, just getting the first team going again would be enough.</p> <p>Yet while Guardiola has changed Barcelona's attitude, got them pressing higher up the pitch, he has done more - much more - than that. \"Those who said he had no experience are idiots,\" says one of his contemporaries, \"Pep was a coach when he was a player. Experience isn't things happening to you, it's learning from them, seeking solutions.\" Intensely inquisitive, Guardiola was always learning - from pioneers like Cruyff and Lillo, from his spells in Qatar, Italy and Mexico. Now his players are learning from him. Obsessed with anticipating problems, his analysis of opponents is as exhaustive as it is exact, his findings presented to players in bite-sized chunks. His training sessions, worked through with those close to him and carried out behind closed doors, are to the point. \"He remembers everything,\" says Xavi. \"And everything is done for a reason, never just for the sake of it.\"</p> <p>He is, says one of his closest collaborators, \"hugely seductive\". He's won over his players, got them running again. Well, some of them: he's had to tell Yaya Tour\u00e9 not to run so much. Busting your guts can be a red herring. The key to football, Guardiola insists, is positioning. And right now Barcelona's positioning couldn't be any better: back on top, 18 long months later.</p> <p><strong>Results: </strong>Malaga 1-4 Barcelona, Athletic 1-4 Villarreal, Atl\u00e9tico 2-0 Mallorca [Kun returns, so do Atl\u00e9tico], Valencia 2-4 Racing, Recreativo 1-1 Getafe, Valladolid 3-2 Sevilla, Espanyol 1-0 Osasuna, Almer\u00eda 1-1 Real Madrid, Sporting 3-1 Numancia, Betis 0-3 Deportivo [Depor scored with a Betis man down.

  "<p>Nothing has highlighted the fragmentation of the left and our inability to intervene collectively and effectively as much as the current economic crisis. There's an eerie silence as the global financial world crumbles and \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/31/banking-royalbankofscotlandgroup\">nationalisation</a>\" just happens. Some say that what is emerging is \"socialism for the bosses\", not the people who have paid the real price. The final settlement is yet to emerge, but the extent to which need not greed is at the heart of bail-outs with hitherto unavailable and unimaginable quantities of public cash, will tell us whether New Labour is changing tack. </p> <p>The left \u2013 and truly progressive forces in all their many guises \u2013 should not wait to find out. Whatever the outcome of the credit crunch rescue mission or the next general election, the social fault lines have been there for all to see since 1997 and beyond. But the left has increasingly failed to find popular yet forceful means of articulating the fall-out from turbo-capitalism and discrimination, let alone organising to make governments act or power shift towards the people. Whatever the roots of the left's inertia \u2013 be it the disillusion with New Labour, middle age or our recent inability to stop the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/09/georgebush.usforeignpolicy\">war in Iraq</a> \u2013 our self-belief is surely shaken. But now is not the moment to give in. </p> <p>The real spectres haunting the earth are clear for all to see: there's still grinding poverty for many. The obsession with markets and failure to understand the importance of public services for collective wellbeing and a sense of belonging, has led to costly, alienating and ineffective mass privatisation. There's disrespect for many public sector workers, mostly low-paid women. Social care services are under-funded and rationed as the need for them grows. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/28/recession-pension-decline-money\">Pensions are disappearing</a>, race and gender discrimination remain breathtakingly evident in the gender pay gap and unemployment patterns. Migrant workers face new threats, the BNP and fascism are on the rise and 5 million people in England alone languish on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/29/social-housing-statistics\">housing waiting lists</a>. That's not to mention the threats facing the planet and the desperate need for international solidarity.</p> <p>These are all issues which the left and civil society organisations together must find new and effective ways to organise and mobilise around. We need strong but flexible coalitions that break with the sectarianism of the past and name, shame and campaign. Organisations as diverse as <a href=\"http://www.londoncitizens.org.uk/\">London Citizens</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\">Fawcett Society</a>, <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a>, <a href=\"http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/\">Searchlight</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cpag.org.uk/\">CPAG</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>, <a href=\"http://www.philosophyfootball.com/\">Philosophy Football</a>, <a href=\"http://www.shelter.org.uk/\">Shelter</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.wdm.org.uk/\">World Development Movement</a> and <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/\">Liberty</a> will all be vital to new forms of sustainable campaigning. </p> <p>But trade unions and the TUC with members and money need to broaden their horizons, initiate and provide long-term support to coalitions on the big issues and give access to workers' organisations across the world. Academics must share their knowledge more freely, working within these coalitions, as well as talking to each other and the already converted. Radical journals should engage with real struggles, as well as develop theory. </p> <p>The left has much to learn from organisations like London Citizens whose winning campaigns are led by those who face poverty and injustice themselves and are rooted in painstaking organising involving established community and faith groups.

  "<h2>Last minute dash</h2> <p>The final, nerve-jangling weekend of the election campaign offered several unpleasant moments for Barack Obama and his supporters, above all the revelation that his Kenyan paternal aunt, Zeituni Onyango, was living in Boston in contravention of a deportation order. (Immigration is an issue that could theoretically draw votes away from Obama, though John McCain is far from a hardline anti-immigration voter's dream candidate.) </p> <p>Then there was the ad, paid for by Pennsylvania Republicans, that broke McCain's promise not to make an issue of Obama's pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who was shown thundering \"God damn America!\" There were robocalls quoting Hillary Clinton calling Obama inexperienced, and also a tape of a newspaper interview which, Republicans argued, showed Obama was willing to bankrupt the US coal industry.</p> <p>But none of it seemed to stick. There was a little time remaining, of course, for these last Republican attacks to weigh against Obama. But by the end of the weekend there was no sign that they had done. The RealClearPolitics average put him on 50% to John McCain's 43% - a lead that, if replicated in tomorrow's election, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/barack-obama-us-elections-polls\">would produce a landslide victory</a>, Suzanne Goldenberg and Ewen Macaskill write in the Guardian today.</p> <p>Both candidates hared across the country, Obama stressing the importance of actually voting and McCain claiming that he could sense that \"the momentum is there\" for him to win. \"What we are in for is a slam-bang finish,\" predicted McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, while McCain's former rival, Fred Thompson, told NBC: \"John's a closer. He always has been. He often is given up for dead - literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.\" But as Obama appeared alongside Bruce Springsteen in Cleveland last night, permitting himself some optimistic words before a crowd of 80,000, the momentum seemed to be heading in one direction only.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>In last-minute campaigning overdrive, McCain visits Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Mexico and Nevada today, finishing with an event in Arizona. Obama is in Florida and North Carolina, and concludes his campaign with a rally in Manassas, Virginia. Both candidates will be interviewed during the halftime break on Monday Night Football. And thus the campaign draws to a close.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama ended the weekend with commanding leads in national polls: 52%-43% in Gallup's likely voter tracking poll, 51%-46% for Rasmussen's and 54%-43% in ABC News's - as good as his best performance to date in that poll. A CNN poll has Obama 53% to McCain's 46%, a USA Today survey (also done by Gallup) puts the candidates at 53%-42%. The scale of the challenge for McCain, in a nutshell: by the Washington Post' reckoning, he'd have to win all the states that are solidly Republican, all the states that are leaning Republican, all the states that are a toss-up - and still find an additional 23 electoral college votes in order to win. Mason-Dixon polls over the weekend put Obama well ahead in Colorado, Virginia, Nevada and North Carolina, and with a narrow lead in Florida, with McCain two points ahead in Ohio and Missouri. And the final poll from the Pew Research Centre doesn't just put Obama in the lead: it goes so far as to predict that he will actually win by six points, 52% to 46%.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/george-bush-legacy-dubya\">Simon Schama: Nowhere man: a farewell to Dubya</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/us-election-republicans-democrats-tomasky\">Michael Tomasky: Liberal paranoiacs, breathe easy</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/03/us-elections-international-opinion\">The world holds its breath as America decides</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/nov/03/uselections-2008-american-muslims\">Road trip, one day to go: America's outcast Muslims</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2008/nov/03/us-president-election-last-day-campaign\">Audio: Suzanne Goldenberg on the closing stages of the campaign</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/video/2008/nov/03/uselections20081\">Video: Gary Younge visits his mother-in-law</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2203420/\">Slate: An Obama loss would be a disaster</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/opinion/03krugman.html?ref=opinion\">Paul Krugman, New York Times: Defeat will leave a Republican rump</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15194.html\">Politico: Superstition and strategy in Obamaland</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/02/AR2008110201737.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: Ohio, the state both candidates covet</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alec-baldwin/voting-for-truth_b_140304.html&quot;\">Huffington Post: Voting for truth</a></p> <h2>Quotes of the weekend</h2> <p>\"You start thinking maybe we might be able to win an election on November 4\": Barack Obama, appearing alongside Bruce Springsteen at a Cleveland rally that drew an estimated 80,000 people, many of whom were reportedly in tears</p> <p>\"I don't know about you, but I want my country back, I want my dream back, I want my America back\": The Boss speaks</p> <p>\"Yesterday, Dick Cheney came out of his undisclosed location.

  "<p>It's time to turn your thoughts to wildlife. Leave seed heads and berries on plants for winter eating. Teasels, dandelions and thistles are weeds but they produce the fine seed that draws in finches \u2013 always a pleasure to see, particularly the <a href=\"http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o56-goldfinch.php.  \">gold</a> ones. <br> The secret is to see the plot as a wildlife larder. Look out for plants that offer winter food and protection. If you haven't got any, consider planting a few. Don't worry too much as to whether they are native or not. It is more important to offer a wide variety of shapes and sizes and keep up the succession throughout the year, particularly in winter when food is scarce. If you happen to have a rough old <a href=\"http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/plants/pyracantha/1003352/ \">firethorn</a> (Pyracantha) around the site leave it. It is invaluable for its winter berries as well as the sharp thorns ideal for protecting hibernating creatures from predators. A Viburnum tinus is a rare source of nectar through winter and it will produce berries in earliest spring. Roses provide nectar and splendid hips \u2013 none bigger and juicier than those of the native dog rose, Rosa canina and the sweet briar or the eglantine rose, <a href=\"http://www.plant-identification.co.uk/skye/rosaceae/rosa-rubiginosa.htm\">Rosa rubiginosa</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-451895517\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/11/3/1225705484052/carolineinsect_house.jpg\" alt=\"insecthouse\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even insects like a night or two in a hotel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Supply water even if it's only a washing up bowl sunken into the ground.

Ponds tick every biodiversity box and are an endless source of fascination, particularly for children. Key points are to place them in a light spot and to make sure that there is a gently sloping shoreline for creatures to get in and out safely.For good pond advice look up <a href=\"http://www.froglife.org/advice.htm\">Froglife</a>. Ban fish as they eat everyone and everything else. Don't let the pond freeze over in winter. If it does, make a hole with hot water. Shattering the ice with an axe sends out awful shock waves to its poor inhabitants, many of which will be hibernating in its depths. </p> <p>The saying goes that there is more life in a dead tree than a living one. Make a log pile in a damp corner so that a colony of dead wood creatures will build up. It is an important habitat for rare beetles. You need to leave the log pile undisturbed for many years as the diet of rotting wood is so low in nutrition that it takes a <a href=\"http://www.stagbeetlehelpline.co.uk/\">stag beetle</a> larvae three and five years to pupate. After that it has from June to August to breed before its life is over. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-451895518\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/11/3/1225705424099/hips.jpg\" alt=\"hips\" width=\"459\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hips, too, are favoured by birds</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you have a generous compost heap or bin you will be providing a habitat of warm decaying plant material \u2013 conditions not easily found elsewhere.

Place bird boxes well out of the way of cats and avoid a due north or due south situation. The birds will inspect them through winter with a view to nesting and may roost in them before that. Bats need a clear flight path and the boxes should be placed high up.</p> <p>Conversely, remember that your needs count too. Protect young brassicas from the birds, particularly pigeons, with netting. They will decimate them as the cold increases and food gets scarcer. Hold the netting away from the crops with a structure so they can't peck through it. Put out bird food.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339257902\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1896199647_islam-FLV-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>American Muslims have been called the \"outcasts\" of this presidential election. Muslims themselves have <a href=\"http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2008/10/23/2033012-us-muslim-voters-are-election-year-outcasts \">told the media</a> that Islam is being treated as \"political leprosy\", a \"scarlet letter\", or the \"kiss of death\". In Pittsburgh, a city with a large Muslim population, the Guardian team heard sentiments like these when we attended a lecture by the writer and political analyst Raeed Tayeh titled Are Americans Obsessed with Islam?, followed by a panel discussion involving local community leaders and advocates.</p> <p>One of the few <a href=\"http://www.cair.com/Portals/0/pdf/American_Muslim_Voter_Survey_2006.pdf \">comprehensive surveys (pdf)</a> of Muslim voters in the United States was produced two years ago by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). While they are a diverse community, American Muslims overall tend to be young, well educated, professional, middle-class, and family-oriented, and differ in their degree of religious observance. Muslims are also somewhat more likely than Americans in general to vote regularly, fly the US flag and do volunteer work.</p> <p>Most importantly for this election, CAIR's demographic research found that American Muslims were concentrated in 12 states, including the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, and Michigan, where they ran from about 3 to 7% of the population. In the survey, 42% of respondents said they were Democrats and just 17% identified themselves as Republicans, while 28% said they did not belong to a political party. This reflects a dramatic turnaround in the past decade: in 2000, George Bush won an astonishing <a href=\"http://www.washington-report.org/archives/Jan_Feb_2001/0101026.html\">72% of the Muslim vote</a>, based on some combination of his social and fiscal conservatism, perceived openness on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and deliberate outreach to the Muslim community. By 2004, with the \"war on terror\" and the war in Iraq under way and civil liberties in a shambles, the numbers were more than reversed, with some 90% of Muslim voters choosing Kerry.</p> <p>This year, it appears that Barack Obama can count on a <a href=\"http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40825\">substantial majority</a> of Muslim votes. To begin with, many Muslims in the United States are African American. Those who trace their roots to the Middle East, Asia, and elsewhere like Obama's record of opposition to the Iraq war and believe he can be better trusted on civil liberties and immigration issues. While some will vote for him enthusiastically, others will do so despite feeling alienated and betrayed by what they see as Obama's eagerness to escape being \"branded\" a Muslim (which 12% of Americans apparently still believe he is).</p> <p>The accusations have been both vicious and absurd: emails and robocalls have declared that Obama attended a fundamentalist madrassah, that he will take the oath of office on the Qur'an, that he is a Manchurian candidate for a worldwide terrorist jihad. In his responses, Obama has often failed to denounce the underlying racism inherent in these attacks, and has done little to dispel the overarching sense that <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95985609\">Islam itself is a stigma</a> from which he must distance himself. \"I'm not and never have been of the Muslim faith,\" he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/naomi-klein/obama-being-called-a-mus_b_89228.html \">said in one interview</a>, as if he were answering to some sort of unChristian activities committee.</p> <p>Imam Mahdi Bray expressed this feeling of betrayal at the Pittsburgh forum. \"No Muslim wants to be sacrificed at the alter of political expediency. I think Barack Obama has practiced that. I think that for his own candidacy that Obama has kind of thrown us under the bus.\"</p> <p>On the other side, however, is John McCain, whose campaign, <a href=\"http://www.contracostatimes.com/columns/ci_10611058\">as one <br>Muslim writer put it</a>, has from the start \"conflated the terms 'Islamic' with 'terrorism' and 'radical extremism'.\" He points to the DVD distributed to tens of thousands of voters in swing states, called \"Obsession: Radical Islam's War on the West,\" with scenes of Muslims \"flying planes into buildings, bombing people, burning American flags and screaming with homicidal rage. Although the video dutifully offered a disclaimer that most Muslims are not fanatics, its horrific images and sinister music conveyed an emotional message about Muslims that was unmistakable.\"</p>",
  "<p>Campaigning for Barack Obama in the still warm and sunny battle-ground of Virginia, what lessons are there for British politics in this historic election?</p> <p>1) First, find your Tony Blair. Watching Obama give a long <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/30/rachel-maddow-interviews_n_139402.html\">interview to Rachel Maddow</a>, a woman who the BBC could hire tomorrow to show how political talk shows can be interesting and fun, I was struck by his uncanny resemblance to Blair. It was time to get past tit-for-tat politics, said Obama. Capitalism was OK. The Republican party had many fine people in it, the Democratic candidate declared. Obama is as devout a Christian as he is devoted family man. Welcome to Barack Blair!</p> <p>2) Speak well. The old rules of rhetoric never go away. Obama is a terrific public orator. Every time he stands at a podium, still, slim and in control of his body as he speaks without notes in short, effective sentences he exudes command and control. By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/01/davidcameron.toryconference1\">David Cameron's conference speech</a> this year was as interesting as John McCain's Tory conference speech in 2007.</p> <p>3) If you are a Conservative, be one. McCain is tarred with being the continuation of Bush-Cheney years by other means. In fact, he opposed much of the Bush ideology over the years. His latest TV advert shows Obama praising McCain for initiating environmental legislation in the Senate. This makes Obama look good but dismays American rightwing voters who don't like to see their man hugging the enemy close.</p> <p>4) Gear up for door-to-door canvassing. Spending time with Democrats gives the lie to the view that American elections are all about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/uselections2008-barackobama-4m-30-minute-infomercial\">big money and TV campaigning</a>. They are but the intensity of phone canvassing and door knocking is greater than I have ever seen in the UK outside byelections. Canvassers have handheld personal data machines that allow instant transfers of voters' intentions and interests. As I write friends are taking leave from work to drive hours to North Carolina to get out the vote in a state where Obama and McCain are neck and neck.</p> <p>5) Hit greed but love business. Obama lashes Wall Street but talks up Main Street. Small businesses are the new working unrich in America. The Tories chez nous are now the party of the super-wealthy as the millionaires' frontbench presided over by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/osborne-tories-deripaska-mandelson\">Oligarch Osborne</a> and super-rich Cameron demonstrate. But Labour can come dangerously close to being anti-business especially in the rhetoric from those looking to a post-election leadership fight.</p> <p>6) Be tough on international issues. Obama wants to <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jnI2PmONXtYeD7lMyxUPK4Y5gEGg\">increase troop commitments</a> in Afghanistan and has taken India to task over <a href=\"http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Obamas_remark_on_solving_Kashmir_dispute_welcome/articleshow/3664967.cms\">Kashmir</a> where nearly a million Indian and Pakistani soldiers face off against each other, instead of the latter being transferred to Pakistan's western borders to help uproot Islamist jihadists seeking to reconquer Afghanistan to close down every girls' school. His vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, is friend and supporter of Georgia's Mikheil Saakashvili in contrast to Tory footsying around with Russian money or Tories on the Council of Europe collaborating with Kremlin puppets. Obama wants to work with Europe as a whole, not deal one by one with EU member states rejecting European unity as in the Hague-Cameron vision of Europe. His promise of an undivided Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel is a further example of a foreign affairs approach that his mixed-message language on Iraq should not occult.</p> <p>7) Don't invite losers to speak at your party conference. Cameron cosied up to McCain who has been the only major international speaker at the Tory conference since Cameron became leader. At least one Tory shadow cabinet member has been spotted sitting with Republicans at the McCain-Obama debates. While some Tory MPs keep Obama buttons in their pockets and I came across a Tory activist working for Obama, the Cameron-McCain link is another example of Cameron's shallow judgment on international politics.</p> <p>8) Talks about individuals not just families. Obama has dropped the tired Clinton line about hard-working families and now talks of hard-working Americans. This is right. In Britain, 30% of households are not family units. They are single people, widows, the divorced, parents alone. Tax policy now has to focus on the individual as much as the family.</p> <p>9) Don't promise too much. Obama is riding two waves. One is the deep sense of despair mixed with shame that the Bush-Cheney years have done so little for America at home and abroad. The second is a deeper tide-of-history movement that is bringing to an end the long 30-year era of global market capitalism which begun with the arrival of Thatcher and Reagan just as they ended the 30-year era of welfare state capitalism initiated after 1945. Americans hope Obama will be the new Roosevelt. He may be a new Carter. But underneath the rhetoric of change, Obama is centrist, cautious and careful in limiting specific pledges. But he is offering a tax cut to all middle- and working-class Americans.</p> <p>10) Don't fall for populism. Obama exudes thought and intellect. He can speak clearly and vividly. He acknowledges differences and seeks to bridge them, not use the culture and other wars throbbing in American civil society as a vehicle for partisan point-scoring. The arrival of 50 million non-Americans in the last 15 years as legal or illegal migrants has provoked political storms across the red (Republican)-blue (Democrat) divide. In Britain there is a loser-takes-all auction between politicians on immigration. Obama refuses to play that populist card and British politics could learn from him.</p>",

Instead, its affluent students are regular targets for attack and attempted kidnappings in an increasingly unstable Kabul. Some now believe foreign forces should leave and the Taliban come back into government.</p> <p>\"I think we have almost reached the point of no return. There are no good solutions left,\" said Ali Padsha, 19, who was raised in America. \"The longer foreign forces stay, the more problems will be created. When we [Afghans] see foreign forces in our country, it makes us crazy, it always has.</p> <p>\"The new Taliban are smarter than before and not as hardcore. They know what to do to keep the people happy.\"</p> <p>Seven years after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating rapidly. \"The rivers are running backwards,\" has become a popular lament in Kabul, whose residents are now looking to a change of leadership in America as the starting point for change in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Afghans generally favour Barack Obama. Some like him because he is the son of a Muslim, affectionately referring to him as Hussein Jan, adding Jan (an Afghan term of endearment) to his middle name. Many educated Afghans believe he has a more nuanced understanding of the regional predicament and support his plans to get tough with Pakistan. But others are cynical, seeing no difference between the candidates and viewing both men's commitment to sending more troops with hostility.</p> <p>Afghans face elections next year and are aware that the new American leader will play a defining role in determining who will be the next Afghan president. </p> <p>\"Whoever takes over America must bring a new leadership to Afghanistan,\" says Fahim Dashti, the editor of the popular Kabul Weekly. The victor will also have to work to counter the country's rampant anti-Americanism.</p> <p>\"The US has failed on everything they said they would do,\" says Dashti, a popular and influential thinker who fought with the Northern Alliance supported by America to drive out the Taliban in 2001.</p> <p>\"They said they were going to get rid of the Taliban - now the Taliban are at the edges of the city and even operating inside Kabul itself. They said they were going to end opium production but there is more opium than ever being produced. They said they were going to bring democracy but what we have is more like a dictatorship. Most people live beneath the poverty line and there is mass unemployment.\"</p> <p>Ali and his university friends are sympathetic to the incoming president. \"I feel bad for whoever wins this election,\" he said. \"They are going to have a really hard job cleaning up the mess left by the previous administration.\"<br><strong>Clancy Chassay</strong></p> <h2>Paris: 'Obama is France's ideal of the American dream'</h2> <p>Paris's Rue La Fayette, named after the great French hero of American independence, is known for its hordes of shopping US tourists. But struggling bars, hotels and even famous department stores are lamenting a fall in trade as US tourist numbers in Paris shrink to a record low. \"Business is down, we're all suffering,\" said Lionel Pinheiro, a waiter at one bistro. \"If Obama wins, I hope it might ease the financial crisis and bring the tourists back.\"</p> <p>Liberal Americans abroad have grown tired of having to apologise for their nationality during the Bush years. But France is now wondering: is it OK to start loving Americans again?</p> <p>\"We don't lynch Americans in the street,\" said Charlotte Lepri, a US specialist at the French thinktank, Institute for Research in Integrated Strategies (IRIS). \"But there are certain associations with Bush. Now there is a turnaround and real enthusiasm for a black candidate who represents France's ideal of the American dream.\"</p> <p>This new optimism could make it easier for the pro-US French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to deepen rapprochement with Washington if Obama is elected. The latest poll shows over 70% of French people would vote for Obama. </p> <p>So great is the myth surrounding Obama, that some analysts warn the public could be in for a shock. The war in Afghanistan, France's increase in troops there and the growing death toll have unsettled public opinion. But few appear to realise that an Obama presidency will ask for more military involvement from allies. \"I don't think all French voters are aware of this part of his project, and they are going to get a surprise,\" said Jacques Mistral of the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI).<br><strong>Angelique Chrisafis</strong></p> <h2>Baghdad: 'The Republicans must finish their commitment'</h2> <p>Dr Amira Edan al-Dabab, above, has spent the past five years picking up the pieces of Iraq's plundered past and fears the results may again be lost if America elects Barack Obama.</p> <p>Since the fall of Baghdad in 2003, Edan, the director of the Iraqi Heritage and Antiquities Directorate, has been travelling the globe in search of up to 15,000 looted relics that used to comprise the essence of the National Museum of Iraq, treasures from three millennia which etched Iraq's place in the Arab heartland.</p> <p>Through half a decade of occupation, several years of brutal insurgency and attempts at sectarian cleansing, Iraq has seen tens of thousands of people killed, and at least two million leave. Security has improved and so too have prospects for some. But throughout Baghdad, many like Edan believe the country could again find itself at the edge of the precipice if the US doesn't tend to unfinished business.</p> <p>\"The Republicans must finish their commitment to Iraq, especially by signing the security treaty,\" she said. \"McCain is going to win,\" she continued. \"I read that the other man nominated is going to pull out the troops. We wish, we need and we hope that this won't happen.\"</p> <p>Most Iraqis seem more concerned about the short term. The time, they say, is not even nearly ripe for the Americans to leave and - for now - they'd rather the devil they know.</p> <p>Twenty kilometres north of Baghdad, the Tarmeya and Qadr district was until earlier this year the most active spot in the most dangerous area of Iraq. But the worm has turned. Tarmeyah is no longer an al-Qaida safe haven and McCain is seen as the best bet to keep it that way. </p> <p>\"If they go now, we may as well all leave too,\" said Bassam Jassam, from the region's dominant tribe, the Mashadani. \"McCain is best for us now. But we need to get through the next two years and after that all the Americans can leave.\"</p> <p>\"The thing we need is stability and strength,\" said Edan. \"If that goes, and it could, all of this could go again. There is so much at stake for us.\"<br><strong>Martin Chulov</strong></p> <h2>Beijing: 'America is going down while China is rising up'</h2> <p>Rao Jin has a soft spot for Barack Obama; he's drawn to his friendly face as well as admiring his personal achievements. But the hero of young Chinese nationalists stops well short of an endorsement.</p> <p>\"I hope the next president can really change the way the US deals with things, always using weapons or economic sanctions,\" says the 24-year-old founder of anti-CNN.com. \"The election has been a hot topic on our site. [But] one individual can't change much. Both Obama and McCain are standing for certain interest groups, and both of them will serve for America's benefit.\"</p> <p>Rao's website became a rallying point for fenqing (\"angry youth\") after the international storm over Tibet this year. He says it is not nationalist; merely a counterweight to western media bias and hegemony.</p> <p>For many in China, the US epitomises Occidental aggression and hypocrisy: preaching free trade but practising protectionism; idealising democracy while allowing vast donations; using human rights to justify invading Iraq.</p> <p>Some hope that Obama's mixed parentage and peripatetic childhood have made him more sympathetic to other cultures. He's popular among the young and there's fascination at the prospect of a black president - and what that would say about US tolerance of differences.</p> <p>But younger people are not counting on America to change itself. Many see the end of its global dominance as inevitable, given China's growing economic and international power.</p> <p>\"America is going down, while China is rising up,\" said Rao. Hu Ben, erstwhile Chinese subtitler for The West Wing and international editor for a major portal, added: \"A lot of young people still think America is our enemy. They're quite happy with the sub-prime crisis - they think this is China's chance.\"</p> <p>Officials and analysts also seem relaxed about the election result. The \"China card\" has been waved less often in this race than previous campaigns. They sense an emerging, broadly optimistic bipartisan consensus on Sino-US relations. John McCain appears more hawkish on security issues and relations with Taiwan, but Obama seems tougher on trade, Tibet, human rights and environmental protection.</p> <p>\"There will be differences on detailed issues, but the big picture won't change whoever wins,\" predicted Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University.<br><strong>Tania Branigan</strong></p> <h2>Moscow: 'We don't beg from the west any more'</h2> <p>With its padded vinyl seats, chrome fittings and Wurlitzer jukebox, the famous Starlite Diner is a little corner of small-town America right in the heart of Moscow. When it opened in 1994, Russia was reeling in post-Soviet turmoil and was trying to court the west for much-needed investment.</p> <p>\"That's all changed now,\" said Sergei Demidov, 35, a banker, tucking into a plate of tenderloin steak and fries. \"We don't beg from the west any more and Washington can't order us around like it did in the 1990s.\"</p> <p>Relations between the US and a resurgent Russia hit a post-cold war low this summer after a fierce proxy conflict in former Soviet Georgia. Most Russians see the US as an aggressive bully that wants to encircle and weaken their country - regardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican is in charge.</p> <p>Barack Obama, however, is widely perceived as the lesser of two evils. A survey in October by Moscow's Levada Centre polling agency showed that 35% of Russians supported Obama, with 14% for John McCain and 37% confessing no sympathy for either. \"Obama would be better,\" said Maria Balandina, 26, an arts events manager. \"He's a democrat, he was against the war in Iraq, he's young.\"</p> <p>Former Vietnam pilot McCain, on the other hand, has called for Russia to be ousted from the G8 for allegedly backsliding on democracy and famously claimed he saw only the letters K-G-B in the eyes of Vladimir Putin (unlike George Bush, who thought he glimpsed the Russian leader's soul).</p> <p>However, observers say Obama's messianic zeal for reform inside America may not transform into a clear foreign policy. McCain, while a tough talker, might be more convenient for Kremlin hardliners who identify with his blunt rhetoric. \"Obama represents a new challenge for Moscow,\" said Andrei Kortunov, an analyst from the New Eurasia foundation. \"I'm just not sure Russia is ready for that challenge quite yet.\" <br><strong>Tom Parfitt</strong></p> <h2>Tehran: 'I'm not optimistic it will make much difference'</h2> <p>Rhythmic chants of \"Marg bar Amrika\" - \"death to America\" - boomed from loudspeakers in the streets as the crowd warmed up for Friday prayers, in an event unchanged since the 1979 revolution.</p> <p>Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, frail but imposing in the white turban and brown robes of a senior cleric, lambasted \"global arrogance\". That is shorthand for the US, but he spells it out anyway. \"The claims the US makes against Iran are wrong. The world is waking up to its lies.\"</p> <p>Weekly prayers combine politics and religion, agitprop with faith. Mullahs, militiamen and civilians, including schoolchildren, are bussed in to sit on the mosque's pale green carpets. Women in black chadors are kept separate behind a screen. Kashani does not mention Barack Obama, though there is plenty of discussion of whether victory for him will do anything to improve relations between these old enemies.</p> <p>Iran's nuclear ambitions - which it insists are peaceful - and its role and influence in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine, have kept it locked in confrontation with the US since George Bush included the Islamic republic in his \"axis of evil\" address in 2002. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, seemed to be signalling no change ahead last week when he called Iran's dispute with America \"deep-seated\". </p> <p>Still, Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president, has spoken of \"new possibilities\" if Obama wins. Parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani found the Illinois senator \"more rational\" than John McCain.</p> <p>By coincidence, the word obama is close to the Farsi for \"with us,\" though few believe a Democratic victory will be enough to draw the sting from this relationship. Some think all the change must come from the US side - an unlikely prospect. \"I'm not optimistic it will make much difference to Iran,\" Mohsen Rezaei, ex-commander of the Revolutionary Guards, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Others hope it will. \"The countries that have good relations with the US see the benefits,\" said Mehdi, a young consultant, walking past Tehran's \"nest of spies\" - the old US embassy, still festooned in angry slogans. \"We should consider that.\"<br><strong>Ian Black</strong></p> <h2>Lahore: 'McCain understands the Pakistan reality better'</h2> <p>The liberal elite at Pakistan's most prestigious university, which offers American-style business education, look like their peers anywhere around the world. Except here many are backing John McCain.</p> <p>The students at the Lahore University of Management Sciences are not drawn to McCain as a person, saying that Barack Obama is far more appealing, but many believe McCain will be better for Pakistan, a view that is widely held across the country.</p> <p>It all goes back to Obama's statement that he would order unilateral and immediate strikes against Osama bin Laden in Pakistan if intelligence pointed to him being present in the country.</p> <p>\"Obama has stated, so clearly, that 'I'm going to attack Pakistan',\" said economics student Motahar Saleheen, between classes at the sprawling LUMS campus. \"One nation should not be allowed to interfere with the sovereignty of another.\"</p> <p>In Pakistan, Obama's remarks have been distilled down to a commitment to \"bomb Pakistan\", causing fury in a country fearful of becoming the next theatre of war in Washington's anti-terror fight.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow, if Obama attacks Pakistan, we will all rise up to defend ourselves, and the western media will brand us all terrorists,\" said fellow student Shahzad Mehboob.</p> <p>Even before Obama's position on Pakistan was known, there has long been a belief in the county that Republicans are more Pakistan-friendly than Democrats, rooted in the massive financial and military aid provided by he Eisenhower, Reagan and Bush presidencies to Islamabad.</p> <p>Pakistan has been a key ally of the Bush administration, which heavily backed the military-led regime of former president Pervez Musharraf, so the change in US president could have a profound impact on the country.</p> <p>\"John McCain understands the Pakistan reality better,\" said politics undergraduate Osama Khawar. \"But as a human being Obama is a better candidate. It's a dilemma for us.\"<br><strong>Saeed Shah</strong></p> <h2>Nairobi: 'Whether you're black or white, vote for Barack'</h2> <p>For reggae fans there is Makadem, for rock, Extra Golden. Folk lovers have Kenge Kenge while Tony Nyadundo offers a more traditional sound.</p> <p>All have recently released songs in Kenya with a common word in the title - Obama - and a similar message.</p> <p>\"If you're voting for real change, Barack Obama be the right man, whether you're black or white, young or old, vote for Barack, Barack Obama,\" sings Makadem, who launched the video for \"Obama be thy name\" at Nairobi's National Theatre last week.</p> <p>Obama-mania in Kenya is no surprise. The Democratic candidate's late father was Kenyan, and many of his relatives, including his 87-year-old step-grandmother Mama Sarah, still live here. Neither is it a recent phenomenon; during his Obama's trip to Kenya in 2006, thousands turned out to see him.</p> <p>But the presidential campaign has lifted the excitement to a new level. Obama's face now appears on many of the ubiquitous Matatu minibus taxis, thousands of bumper stickers bear his name. Locally printed campaign T-shirts are selling fast; one features the slogan \"Ndio Tunaweza\" - Swahili for \"Yes we can\". A musical based on Obama's memoir is set to open. Underlying the enthusiasm, is aspiration: many people still believe strongly in the American dream; Kenya has more students studying in the US than any other African country. And Obama, whose father travelled to Hawaii on a scholarship, is the ultimate embodiment of that immigrant dream.</p> <p>Policy-wise, a more nuanced US approach to terrorism issues, especially in places like Somalia, might be expected. But the biggest change may be intangible. One Kenyan columnist wrote this week an Obama win would unleash a \"momentum of enlightenment\" proving that talent and character rather than ethnicity and power should determine success.<br><strong>Xan Rice</strong></p> <h2>Gaza: 'Without pressure on Israel there's no solution'</h2> <p>Only a few years ago the bright yellow and orange al-Awda Factory for Biscuits and Ice Cream was a vibrant business and one of the largest factories in the Palestinian territories. Today, like most private firms in the Gaza Strip, it is in dire trouble.</p> <p>Only one of four production lines is working. There are barely two-dozen staff producing packets of hazelnut-flavoured wafers. There is not enough ink to print a sell-by date, not enough cardboard boxes to hold the packets, not enough plastic to wrap the boxes. When the wafers are delivered, they arrive at stores in old fruit cartons. Sales are down to 25% of what they were eight years ago. And this is a good day - for the previous week all production lines were shut down for want of ingredients, packaging and spare parts.</p> <p>The factors that have brought the biscuit factory to such a parlous state will be one of many unenviable Middle East challenges awaiting the new president.</p> <p>Since the Islamist movement Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and then took full control of Gaza last year, Israel has gradually increased the pressure on what it calls the \"hostile entity\". It has severely limited imports and prohibited all exports. Few of Gaza's 1.5 million people can ever leave. Despite this, Hamas grows steadily stronger, not weaker.</p> <p>Like many Gazans, Mohammed Telbani, the factory's general manager, says he has little interest in the election. \"Presidents have changed but no one did anything for us,\" he said, waving his hand dismissively. He doubts that a new president will have the power or the will to reverse decades of US policy in the Middle East which he, like most here, sees as decisively pro-Israeli. \"Without pressure on Israel there won't be any solution to the problem,\" he said.</p> <p>If they had to choose, most Palestinians, like most other Arabs, would probably side with Obama (and, conversely, opinion polls show more Israelis would side with McCain). Gazans talk urgently about the need to lift the economic blockade of the strip, to allow the crossings to open and the economy to restart. Palestinians as a whole simply want Washington to play a much tougher role as a Middle East peace broker, bringing concrete change and eventually that much-promised independent Palestinian state.<br><strong>Rory McCarthy</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday November 3 2008.

  "<p>What would Old Big 'Ead have made of this? A game that for so long was not worthy of the prize at the end of it, the Brian Clough Trophy, was besmirched with controversy in stoppage time as two <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/derbycounty\">Derby</a> goals were ruled out and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/nottinghamforest\">Nottingham Forest</a> goalkeeper, Lee Camp, saved Nacer Barazite's penalty after its dubious award by the referee, Stuart Attwell.</p> <p>With eight bookings and a debatable red card shown to Forest's Lewis McGugan in the second half, this is another game that will long be associated with the Nuneaton official. Atwell it was who achieved infamy in September when he gifted Reading the \"phantom\" goal at Watford, even though the ball had crossed the goalline two yards wide of the goal.</p> <p>He was stood down by the Professional Game Match Officials board following that mistake and his display here will surely come under review following a complaint from the Derby manager, Paul Jewell. \"His sending-off was harsh, some of his bookings were harsh, I'm not sure it's a penalty, then why he doesn't give the goal I don't know,\" blasted Jewell. \"He gave the most unbelievable decision at Watford. He's 25, he's meant to be the next best thing since sliced bread, then he's taken out of the Premier League and he's given a game of this magnitude. It beggars belief.\" </p> <p>Attwell's impact on the match was first felt in the 74th minute when he dismissed McGugan for a lunge at Paul Green, the third time the referee has brandished his red card in as many games. While it was a two-footed challenge, both Jewell and Colin Calderwood, his Forest counterpart, agreed a booking would have sufficed. </p> <p>In the third minute of injury time Attwell awarded Derby a penalty when Barazite's cross skipped up and struck Luke Chambers's arm. Miles Addison proceeded to head the ball into the net but Attwell did not play the advantage. Camp, playing against his old team, brilliantly tipped Barazite's low spot-kick around the post and followed that with an even better diving save to his left to parry Emanuel Villa's header. </p> <p>From Barazite's ensuing corner, Addison again powered a header inside the far post, only for Attwell to give Forest a free-kick. \"He says he's seen a push,\" said Jewell. \"I think he's just guessing. Whoever says that's not a goal shouldn't be on the pitch refereeing. It's a 100% goal. I've never felt as aggrieved in my life.\" </p> <p>Calderwood was less perturbed by Attwell's performance. \"Obvious push, there were probably three or four fouls in there,\" he remarked with a mischievous grin. \"It wasn't a penalty but I'm very glad it was given against us. The referee judged the game really well. That's twice we've had him and I've no complaints.\" Any neutral onlookers, and there were not many among the frenzied sell-out crowd of 33,070 for the first east Midlands derby for three years, were grateful for the drama following a miserable opening half.</p> <p>So anxious were the majority of the 22 players who started the match that it was no surprise that three substitutes, Derby's Barazite and Villa and Forest's Chambers, were responsible for the game's two goals - Villa inadvertently bundling the ball into his own net after his goalkeeper, Stephen Bywater, had saved Chambers's shot, and then doing likewise at the right end after Barazite flicked on Kris Commons's free-kick. </p> <p>Attwell, however, was the ultimate influence in determining that Clough's wife, Barbara, would present the trophy to both captains.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Lee Camp</p> <p>Having been born in Derby and begun his career at Pride Park, he was booed throughout by the home fans but produced two superb saves in injury time to earn Forest a point</p> <p><strong>Best moment</strong> In the space of 30 seconds he pushed away Nacer Barazite's penalty low to his right and Emanuel Villa's header low to his left</p>",
  "<p>Mexico's efforts to get to grips with spiralling drug crime and corruption suffered a blow at the weekend when one of the country's top police officers resigned amid allegations that drugs cartels had infiltrated his department.</p> <p>Gerardo Garay, the head of Mexico's military-style federal police force, stepped down to head off suspicion that he was working for a major drugs cartel. \"I am resigning because the bloody fight against organised crime makes it our duty to strengthen institutions, which means it is essential to eliminate any shadows of doubt regarding me,\" Garay told a press conference. \"I will put myself at the disposal of the judicial authorities.\" He denied any wrong in the federal police force, and an official statement from the chief prosecutor's office at the weekend indicated he is not under investigation.</p> <p>But the decision is the latest episode in the government's desperate battle to control the drug gangs who have been infiltrating Mexico's security forces as one prong of their strategy within an increasingly no-holds-barred organised crime war.</p> <p>Press reports have linked one of Garay's closest lieutenants to the Sinaloa cartel, which is a major protagonist in the drug wars. On Saturday the daily newspaper Reformer said the federal police had effectively \"sold\" control of the customs operations at Mexico City's international airport to the gang. So-called \"narco banners\" have also recently accused Garay of protecting Sinaloa-associated drug lords. Narco banners are propaganda messages purporting to be from different trafficking organisation that usually seek to discredit a rival gang, and are often hung from pedestrian bridges over major roads.</p> <p>Mexico's deepening drugs crisis started four years ago as a fairly straightforward, if brutal, competition between different gangs. They are fighting for control of routes for trafficking cocaine from Colombia, as well as a growing domestic users market.</p> <p>Then a military-led crackdown launched by President Felipe Calderon in December 2006 both complicated who was fighting who, and triggered a dramatic escalation of the violence. Execution-style murders have risen to close to 4,000 so far this year, including dozens of decapitations as well as a growing number of civilian victims with no obvious association with either drug trafficking or the security forces.</p> <p>Some analysts believe the cartels have also increased the amount of effort and funds dedicated to corrupting the authorities.</p> <p>This is not the first time the federal police have been under suspicion. Garay took over as acting commissioner of the force six months ago, after his predecessor was killed by a hired assassin outside his parents' home in Mexico City. The gunman not only knew the supposedly secret movements of the police chief; he also had a key to the external door.</p>",
  "<h2>Danit Brown</h2> <p>The day after the election, I saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> standing in the produce aisle of my local grocery store, wearing an \"I voted\" sticker and holding a cantaloupe. Outside, his wife waited in a station-wagon pointed north. \"What's he doing in Michigan?\" my husband wanted to know. \"Where are his bodyguards?\" Already, someone had driven through our town and taken down all the signs promising change, requisitioning them for fuel for a bonfire so large that the planes taking off and landing at the airport two towns over were going to be able see it. Even now, we could catch faint whiffs of burning posterboard whenever the A/C kicked on. \"Change, my ass,\" said the cashier who rang up our bottled water, first-aid kit and the masking tape we were going to use to keep our windows from shattering. \"I hear they're closing the border to Canada.\" In the produce aisle, Obama set down the cantaloupe and picked up a tomato. We all pretended not to see. I imagined walking up to him, taking his hand, saying, \"Come to my house. Stay with me. We have cable and a foldout sofa, and a gun for protection.\" I imagined his fingers, warm and dry, in mine. I liked him. He was handsome: tall, thin, a father of girls. In the voting booth, the day before, I'd pictured White House interns flashing their thongs, the leaders of nations peeling grapes and swooning, the Oval Office a den of love. How could they help it? I was miles and miles away from Washington, my finger poised over the lever, and on the other side of the privacy curtain, my husband - short and white and blotchy - was coughing politely: I'd already taken too long. Behind us, the line of voters stretched out the door, across the parking lot. I thought I was the only one, but later, on the news, they'd reported I wasn't, that thousands of us had turned in blank ballots, unable, finally, to cast a vote for a world whose rules we didn't know. \"Who does that?\" my husband had muttered, his nostrils flaring the way they do when he lies. \"Beats me,\" I said. \"Beats me.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Danit Brown is the author of Ask For A Convertible, a collection of short stories. </p> <h2>Hari Kunzru</h2> <p>Here in New York, we're still reeling. The victory celebrations had a tinge of mania to them. For one night, we allowed ourselves to believe that it was the beginning of a new era. Post-racial! Post-feminist! Post-culture wars! Post-Bush! Grumpy Grampy and Caribou Barbie didn't win through, at least not here. But the real undercurrent of hysteria wasn't the thwarted assassination attempt by that splinter group from the Michigan Militia, but the unwelcome knowledge that we've entered the Post-Boom. America's world dominance is over. There'll be no new buildings in NYC for at least 10 years. Brooklyn thirtysomethings are resigning themselves to being in debt for ever. Upper East Side pre-schools are offering Chinese as standard. The bank back-office staff are carrying their cardboard boxes to the door and the hipsters are rubbing their hands in anticipation of a revival of the golden era of downtown - cheap rents, cheap drugs, empty spaces to hold parties. Yes, once the yuppies retreat there shall be punk poetry and DIY experimental sound-art for all. One vast pop-cultural reenactment - every nuance of No-Wave studied and recreated. We're only a month in, and Obama's decision to raise tariffs to \"save the economy\" hasn't really hit home.

It's dog-eat-dog time, and the big dogs have the best lobbyists.

Certainly I couldn't. </p> <p>After all, who would have guessed that the worst accusations lobbied against John McCain by Barack Obama's most fervent supporters, and against Barack Obama by John McCain's, would turn out to be true? That Barack Obama was indeed a covert Muslim terrorist - and also, simultaneously, a radical black Christian - whose true agenda was to disenfranchise white Americans, institute a broad-based socialist agenda of government hand-outs and immense taxation, then hand the whole nation over to the terrorists and retire to an island in the Caribbean? That John McCain was in fact a doddering old fool - and also, simultaneously, a vicious ultra-conservative mastermind - whose actual goal was to deprive middle-class Americans of healthcare, job opportunities and all their hard-earned social freedoms before dying a year into office and allowing Sarah Palin to assume the mantle of power, appointing Dick Cheney her vice-president and puppet-master? And that it would all come to light on the afternoon before election day, in a fashion so conspicuous and indisputable?</p> <p>It was a dispiriting turn of events, to say the least. </p> <p>Of course, most Americans, horrified by the choice with which they suddenly had been presented - a terrorist on one ticket and a dictator on the other - and unable to fathom voting for the Libertarians or (God forbid) the Greens, chose to stay home, away from the polls on November 4. But as for the rest of us, and I number myself among them, what were we to do? In the privacy of the voting booth, how were we to make our decision? </p> <p>I'm sure you'll recall the chaos of election night, as poll workers across the nation counted by hand the tens of millions of write-in candidates whose names marked our ballots. It was several weeks before every vote was recorded and the tabulations checked and rechecked. </p> <p>As the whole world now knows, the winner, by some 10,000 ballots, was America's most beloved movie personality, Tom Hanks. Mr Hanks is neither a radical black Christian Muslim terrorist nor a near-dead senile ultra-conservative, but a patriot. He has announced that he is prepared to accept the responsibilities of high command and is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20 which, according to Entertainment Weekly, should give him just enough time to finish his voiceover work for Toy Story 3 before assuming the duties of office. </p> <p>We are all wondering who he will name as his vice-president. I'm rooting for Julia Roberts. Julia Roberts or maybe Will Smith. I'll be happy either way. </p> <p>In any case, I am certain Mr Hanks will get the economy, the housing crisis and that nasty business in the Middle East straightened out in no time. I, for one, am looking forward to four years of peace, prosperity, and delightful Pixar productions, the kind with those hysterical fake out-takes at the end - you know the ones I mean.

We were interested in the results, in the actual numbers, but during the months leading up to the election, we consumed our fill of comment and interpretation and what passes for analysis and then declared moratoriums on the sorry lot - The News Hour, Election Center, Ballot Bowl, the best political team on television, if they did say so themselves. We twisted the coverage shut like a tap. What need did we have for additional information? We were not, after all, undecided. Our pronouncements, however, lacked teeth, and will power. So there we were, on the sofa, facing the commentators, listening, weighing, smirking. Wolf Blitzer advised that the only way to watch was with a laptop at one's side. Someone else said something about narrative, about message, about running a highly disciplined campaign. That is so true, I said. Hadley looked over at me, narrowing her eyes and nodding. We were in profound agreement and we continued to watch.</p> <p>Our baby got us up at six. Sometimes he sleeps an extra hour, it just depends, on what we're still not sure. As Hadley pumped Elliot some milk for the day and then readied for work, I played with him on the floor. Obama won, I told him, handily. Obama, I said again. It was a name I imagined he liked the sound of. I said the name once more, elongating the syllables this time, enunciating. He, too, had seen some of the coverage, looking up from his blanket as the candidates delivered snippets of speeches. I had explained it to him, who was who and what they were about. I laid it all out, not in baby talk but in complete sentences spoken sweetly and with a little silliness. I try to talk to Elliot in sentences, I guess, so he hears whole thoughts. This was his first election. It was a good year to be born. Tomorrow, I thought, he will be six months old.</p> <p>\u2022 Paul Maliszewski's collection of essays, Fakers, will be published by The New Press in January. </p> <p>\u2022 These stories are taken from Five Dials magazine, published monthly by Hamish Hamilton.

  "<p>\"Forgotten but not gone\" was the way in which the supremo of Boston politics, Billy Bulger, liked to dismiss the human irritants he had crushed beneath his trim boot. The same could now be said for the hapless 43rd President of the United States as the daylight draws mercifully in on his reign of misfortune and calamity. How is he bearing up, one wonders, as the candidate from his own party treats him as the carrier of some sort of infectious political disease? How telling was it that the most impassioned moment in John McCain's performance in the final debate was when he declared: \"I am not George Bush.\"</p> <p>Where, O where are you, Dubya, as the action passes you by like a jet skirting dirty weather? Are you roaming the lonely corridors of the White House in search of a friendly shoulder around which to clap your affable arm? Are you sweating it out on the treadmill, hurt and confused as to why the man everyone wanted to have a beer (or Coke) with, who swept to re-election four years ago, has been downgraded to all-time loser in presidential history, stuck there in the bush leagues along with the likes of James Buchanan and Warren Harding? Or are you whacking brush in Crawford, where the locals now make a point of telling visitors that George W never really was from hereabouts anyroad.</p> <p>Whatever else his legacy, the man who called himself \"the decider\" has left some gripping history. The last eight years have been so rich in epic imperial hubris that it would take a reborn Gibbon to do justice to the fall. It should be said right away that amid the landscape of smoking craters there are one or two sprigs of decency that have been planted: record amounts of financial help given to Aids-blighted countries of Africa; immigration reform that would have offered an amnesty to illegals and given them a secure path to citizenship, had not those efforts hit the reef of intransigence in Bush's own party. And no one can argue with the fact that since 9/11 the United States has not been attacked on its home territory by jihadi terrorists; though whether or not that security is more illusory than real is, to put it mildly, open to debate. </p> <p>Bet against that there is the matter of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilian casualties, more than 4,000 American troops dead, many times that gravely injured, not to mention the puncture wounds and mutilations inflicted on internationally agreed standards of humane conduct for prisoners - and on the protection of domestic liberties enshrined in the American constitution. If the Statue of Liberty were alive, she would be weeping tears of blood.</p> <p>If Bush himself has been largely kept out of sight, his baleful legacy has been visible in the McCain campaign. McCain has made much of his credentials for independence of mind, a claim which once was credible given his support for immigration reform and opposition to Bush's tax cuts. But somewhere along the road to the Republican nomination, all of this became less important than the lessons of the Reagan-Bush-Rove political playbook which, with the exception of the Clinton election of 1992, seemed to have a track record of unbroken success. </p> <p>McCain knew this from bitter personal experience, having been on the receiving end of Bush lowball politics in the South Carolina primary in 2000. Coming out of a convincing win against George Bush in New Hampshire he was stopped in his tracks by a smear campaign conducted through push-poll phone calls in which people were asked whether they knew that the daughter McCain had adopted from Sri Lanka was in fact the illegitimate child of an affair with a woman of colour. Now you would think McCain could never reconcile himself to a politician capable of those kinds of tactics. But there he was in the campaign of 2004, stumping the country for the incumbent, ingratiating himself with the conservative base he knew he would need, even as his old Vietnam buddy, John Kerry, was being coated in slime by the Swift Boaters. </p> <p>Whatever misgivings McCain might have had about adopting the hardball tactics of his 2000 adversary have long since disappeared before the blandishments of classic Bush-style operatives like Rick Davis and Stephen Schmidt. \"Do you want to be pure, or do you want to win\"? they must have asked right after the nomination. Ditching Joe Lieberman as a running mate and unleashing pitbull Palin was his answer. </p> <p>So even while George Bush is kept at arm's length from the campaign, his campaign style lives on as Obama is stigmatised as a terrorist-friendly stealth-socialist, too deeply unAmerican to be let anywhere near the Oval Office. \"He just doesn't see America as we do\" says Sarah Palin trying to wink her way into Dick Cheney's seat. McCain is betting the house that this way of doing politics has at least one more hurrah left in it, and we will find out on in the early hours of Wednesday morning whether he is right.</p> <p>The Bush presidency is the spectre haunting the feast in more than tactics. Although every conservative administration since Ronald Reagan has promised to deliver, through supply-side stimulation, economic growth without bloated deficits, they have never been vindicated in their blind faith in what Bush senior once rashly called \"voodoo economics\". Consistently, they have brought the US Wall Street crashes and recessions along with massive deficits; and yet somehow, the stake that history attempts to drive through the heart of their economic theology never puts the ghoul away. </p> <p>No weight of evidence to the contrary has ever shaken the totemic belief that tax cuts can grow the economy robustly enough to compensate for drastic shortfalls in revenue. George W Bush clung to this belief even as the Clinton budget surplus was converted into a mountainous deficit, and John McCain continues to parrot the same belief with the shining face of a true believer. </p> <p>Not even Gibbon could supply a story as fatefully bizarre as the ultimate consummation of Reagan-Bush conservatism, its last act: the most massive shift of financial power from the private to the public sector since the New Deal. Rather like the Pope deciding that all along he really wanted a barmitzvah. </p> <p>If you look at this saga as the history of a dynasty; it's come full circle. For, believe it or not, there once was a time when Bush politics was about centrist moderation. Dubya's revered granddad, Prescott Sheldon Bush, son of an Ohio railroad executive and senator for Connecticut from 1952 to 1963, was punished in the Catholic towns of industrial Connecticut for his connection with Planned Parenthood. Not only that, but he was a trustee of the United Negro College Fund, the kind of institution that made the eventual career of Barack Obama conceivable. </p> <p>But the Bushes have always been selective about idealism. And even at the height of the Kennedy-Johnson apogee, Prescott and George Herbert Walker Bush were turning the pages of Barry Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative. They could smell the wind direction changing. The future of Republican money and Republican power lay elsewhere; with Texas oil. Hence the migration to Midland Texas of George Herbert Walker Bush and his makeover into a Texan who knew the ways of the corporate world; and how to bring about the Great Cosiness between government and business that seemed like the perfect feedback loop: money to power, power to money; tax breaks for the corporations; donations to those who might command the heights.</p> <p>This is the politics George W Bush inherited, and he has been its faithful disciple; to the point of purging it of any remaining traces of pragmatism. It is astounding to hear rightwing talkshow bloviators rant about the predicament of the Bush administration being caused by its failure to carry out the true conservative agenda. For there never has been and never will be a more doctrinally faithful instrument of the creed. Never mind the hanging chads of 2000, the Cheney-Bush administration seized the moment to bring on the Goldwater-Reagan Rapture in which government was once and for all got out of the way of business.</p> <p>So it hasn't really been all George Bush's fault, the stupendous American fiasco. He came to power armed with an ideology that was about to crash and burn; that was, years before the present tumult, already fatally disconnected from historical reality. It was on his watch that American government needed reinventing. It was responsible government that was needed in Iraq and Afghanistan; government that was desperately needed in New Orleans after Katrina, while all George Bush could manage was a fly-by. It is government that this most anti-governmental of all American administrations is learning that is needed now to save the United States from a second Depression. </p> <p>In his heart of hearts I actually think the shell-shocked Dubya, somewhere in the bowels of his presidency knows this. But he is nowhere to be found, and so on goes the mad rant that health care reform and progressive taxes are the Trojan horse for socialist revolution. To which those who have another view altogether might want to say, fear not, for yours, as a Republican president once said, is a government of the people, by the people. And really it will not perish from the earth.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339263795\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama entered the final hours of the longest and most expensive election campaign in American history in an upbeat mood yesterday, voicing confidence that the Democrats have a \"righteous wind at our back\".</p> <p>Obama's campaign team predicted that he would break the pattern of US politics to take long-established Republican states. The RealClearPolitics average put him on 50% to John McCain's 43%, a lead that, if replicated in tomorrow's election, would produce a landslide victory.</p> <p>The McCain camp came out in force too to argue that the Republican was still in contention and that it would be a mistake to write him off. \"What we are in for is a slam-bang finish,\" McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, predicted.</p> <p>Nearly two years after it began, the closing hours of the epic battle for the White House saw both camps making an exhaustive effort to win over the diminishing camp of undecided voters and get the faithful to the polls.</p> <p>In a swing through Ohio yesterday, Obama returned to the promise of a new kind of politics that has defined his campaign. \"It won't be easy, it won't be quick, but you and I know it's time to come together and change this country,\" he told a rally in Columbus. \"We can't let this slip away.\"</p> <p>McCain, meanwhile, pleaded with voters to ignore polls showing Obama ahead. \"My friends, I've been in a lot of campaigns, I know when momentum is there,\" he told a crowd in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. \"We're going to win. I sense it and I feel it and I know it.\"</p> <p>After defeat in the 2000 and 2004 elections, the Democrats, buoyed by poll numbers, were increasingly prepared to abandon the nervous hesitation about voicing in public their hopes that they were finally on the verge of victory. The Democratic senator Chuck Schumer told CBS television: \"Wednesday morning, Dems are going to be very happy.\"</p> <p>David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, was also optimistic, telling CBS he was cheered by the surge in early voting which favoured Democrats. \"The edge is pretty substantial in our favour,\" he said.</p> <p>By Saturday night, some 27 million Americans had already cast their ballots, making it increasingly difficult for McCain to catch up tomorrow.</p> <p>In Colorado, a once-Republican state where Obama now leads, 46% of the electorate turned out for early voting. North Carolina, an even more strongly Republican state, also showed heavy early voting in favour of the Democrat. In south Florida, which is heavily Democratic, the waiting time for early voting was as long as six hours.</p> <p>\"We feel good,\" Axelrod said. \"It is not just the polls. It is the early voting ... These figures are coming in strong for us, reversing the traditional patterns.\"</p> <p>The Republicans, while admitting the odds were stacked against them, insisted that McCain could close the gap. \"John's a closer. He always has been,\" Fred Thompson, the Law and Order star and a former rival for the White House, told NBC. \"He often is given up for dead - literally and politically. People have been wrong about him before.\"</p> <p>A poll yesterday by the Pew Research Centre did show some slippage in Obama's lead over McCain, but the Democrat was still ahead by 49% to 42%. None of the more than 250 polls conducted since September 25 has put McCain in the lead.</p> <p>The frantic closing hours saw Republicans in Pennsylvania breaking a promise by McCain not to make an issue of race, with an ad using clips from a now infamous sermon of Obama's former pastor, the Rev Jeremiah Wright, in which he thunders: \"God damn America!\"</p> <p>McCain has \"a very steep hill to climb\", Karl Rove, the mastermind of George Bush's election victories, told Fox.</p> <p>Republicans also paid for robocalls - taped telephone messages - quoting Hillary Clinton from when she stood against Obama for the Democratic nomination, saying he was inexperienced and the White House was no place for \"on the job training\".</p> <p>McCain's team, which has been outspent in advertising by Obama almost every day since the campaign formally began early in September, said in an email to supporters yesterday that it would match him on the eve of election. \"In the final days of the campaign, our television presence will be bigger and broader than the Obama campaign's presence.\" The McCain camp said it would outspend Obama by $10m (\u00a36m) in the coming hours.</p> <p>McCain devoted most of his final hours trying to shore up support in Republican states. Aside from yesterday's stop in Pennsylvania, his itinerary called for trips to Florida, Ohio, Missouri, and even Tennessee, with a swing through the Rocky mountain states of Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico before returning to his home in Arizona tonight.</p> <p>Obama, who was in Ohio yesterday with Bruce Springsteen, will campaign exclusively in Republican territory today.</p>",
  "<p>Goldcrests are so minuscule - in fact the smallest songbirds in the UK - that you imagine one passing its entire life in just a single large tree. Certainly this individual, looking more mouse than bird, threaded its way with minute and furtive precision through a large ivy bush. It would vanish down tiny crannies of shadow and then emerge minutes later into the sunlight, all the while maintaining an incessant harvest of micro-invertebrates. When I finally continued my walk, it had barely moved more than a metre from its original position. </p> <p>Although I might imagine a single tree forming its whole world, this is at odds with other aspects of the goldcrest's ecology. They breed as far north as the Arctic Circle, even surviving in a winter landscape where the temperature can fall to -25C and there are 18 hours of frost-scabbed darkness each night. Just as impressive is the capacity of some Scandinavian and Russian goldcrests to cross the North Sea. In the past this was deemed so miraculous that people believed they hitched a ride on the backs of owls or woodcocks. It's a piece of old folklore for which I would love to find hard proof. </p> <p>There are, however, authentic reports of migrant goldcrests descending aboard the old lightships during the night and, sometimes, when completely disoriented by fog or drizzle, they would rain down to their doom on to the open water. In an age when we had a North Sea herring fleet, the fishermen would describe goldcrests accumulating in the boat sails like nocturnal flies in a trap. There is a modern equivalent because the birds are routinely witnessed on offshore oil platforms. Is there not something deeply strange but wonderful in the idea of these tiny creatures finding succour, briefly, on these vast industrial giants in the middle of the sea?</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Dermot O'Leary - watch out! Monkey only mentions this as the BBC Radio 2 man won a gold award at the prestigious Sony Radio Academy awards earlier this year. Only problem is, so did his sometime Radio 2 colleagues Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross. Brand, said the Sony judges, was a \"unique broadcaster - the audience genuinely do not know what to expect from one link to the next\". Unfortunately, neither did the station's controller, Lesley Douglas. Ross, added the judges, delivered a \"must listen\" show. Especially if you happen to be Radio 2's head of compliance, it omits to add. Curse of the Sonys, anyone?</p> <p>\u2022 Ah, the perils of being a poacher turned gamekeeper. \"Vice girl: Tory Osborne watched my S&amp;M sex games\", was the front-page headline of the News of the World last weekend. But how was the paper able to track down \"dominatrix\" Natalie Rowe? Because she first appeared in the NoW three years ago, with another story about the Tory shadow chancellor when the paper was edited by Andy Coulson, now ... director of communications for the Conservative party. What goes around ...</p> <p>\u2022 Still with the News of the World, Monkey hears the paper has been for another thinktank weekend at a hotel in Reading. Slough hostelries were presumably all booked up. Anyway, the paper commissioned some fascinating research to discover which of the paper's brands were most popular among readers. Top of the shop were the Dr Hilary Jones advice column, sport ... and its weekly showbiz column Rav. Which makes it even more of a shame that showbiz editor Rav Singh is leaving the paper to go freelance.</p> <p>\u2022 No one likes writing about the weather quite as much as the Daily Express. So last week's cold weather was a godsend for Richard Desmond's paper, which warned that an \"Arctic freeze ... would take many people by surprise\". And so it did, not least the good people of the Express, where ice and cold slush dripped through the roof of the Northern &amp; Shell building and on to the editorial floor. Sandbags were not required, but strategically placed wastepaper bins were. Not the best of splashes, Monkey thinks.</p> <p>\u2022 But back to Brand. If only the erstwhile Radio 2 DJ had made a better impression on Gordon Brown, then perhaps the prime minister might not have been quite so unstinting in his criticism of his show. Brand, you see, bumped into Brown at the Royal Court theatre the week before the infamous broadcast went out. \"I grabbed his little bum,\" Brand told listeners to his Radio 2 podcast. \"I like him,\" replied Ross. \"If I could say where I was going to vote I would say I was voting for them, but I'm not allowed to say where I'm voting because I'm forbidden by my BBC contract.\" Ross is no stranger to bias, having been castigated in a BBC Trust report for the \"single most shocking breach of impartiality on the BBC in recent years\" when he presented the Live 8 concerts. That 12-week suspension can't pass quickly enough!</p> <p>\u2022 It was a bruising week for the BBC's new director of audio and music, Tim Davie, who drew on all his broadcasting experience - ie none - with his less than outright criticism of Brand and Ross, describing the pair as \"brilliant entertainers\". Well, there's brilliant, Tim, and then there's brilliant, as Alan Partridge might say. As he's the BBC's former head of marketing and communications, Monkey would have thought he was used to dealing with brands.</p> <p>\u2022 Away from Radio 2 for a moment: Celebrity Big Brother producer Endemol was planning some high jinks of its own - by interviewing the Holocaust denier David Irving for the next series of the Channel 4 reality show. Irving said on his website that he had a 90-minute meeting with producers. \"They seem very keen, pleased that I am so upfront, open and uninhibited.\" We're sure they were. Alas, Irving did not make the cut. A Big Brother spokesperson told the Jewish Chronicle that he had not been \"seriously considered\" as a contestant.</p> <p>\u2022 The fiery columnist Melanie Phillips should surely have declared an interest before laying into Brand and Ross last week (sample headline: \"Public revulsion engulfs the BBC\"). Phillips was a guest on The Moral Maze on Radio 4 at 10.15pm - exactly the same time as Brand's infamous Sachs-baiting show was going out on Radio 2. Come on Mel, admit it, you were worried he was stealing your listeners.</p> <p>\u2022 At least Brand's departure means no more airings of that rather irritating TV ad for Radio 2 in which the (former) DJ mucked around on the mandolin. Monkey hears that some Radio 2 DJs won't miss it either, peeved that the station's marketing campaign bigged up its newer, edgier DJs while ignoring those presenters who were slightly, ahem, longer in the tooth.</p> <p>\u2022 Monkey can't help but feel the good people of GQ got rather overexcited by the publication of its 20th anniversary issue - its biggest edition yet. A press release breathlessly announced that the December issue would weigh in at a \"whopping 582 pages and with the spine measuring 21cm\". Twenty-one centimetres? Now that is a big issue.</p>"
