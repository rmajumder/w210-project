  "<p>I have never been to a football match or read a Jeffrey Archer novel. My daughter hasn't been clubbing or eaten a steak and kidney pie. If only we were famous - then we could make a few quid appearing on Marcus Brigstocke's new series, in which celebrities try \"quite ordinary things\" for the very first time. In the meantime you'll have to make do with Phill Jupitus encountering his first Findus Crispy Pancake and delivering the less than ringing endorsement: \"Red Leicester? My fat arse!\" You can also find out what he makes of colonic irrigation in <strong>I've Never Seen Star Wars</strong> (6.30pm, Radio 4).</p> <p>Let's blot out that unpleasant image by imagining an orange snowstorm sweeping down from Canada and the US to the pine forests of central Mexico. It's made up of millions of monarch butterflies, making their annual migration from their breeding grounds to their winter \"pasture\". Sadly, this magnificent sight is under threat, as the butterflies' habitats are threatened by herbicide use in the north and illegal logging in the south.

  "<p>Stories about climate change are generally depressing: melting ice sheets, more intense hurricanes and species vanishing as humans steadily push up the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But out of the impending gloom has come the promise of technology to slow or even reverse some of the decline. </p> <p>In its simplest form, clean (or green) technology is anything that helps consumers or industries to use basic materials such as energy, water and waste more efficiently and, while using it, lessen their environmental footprint. Unlike IT, biotech or telecommunications, there is no agreed definition of \"cleantech\" but it is a hot area, thanks to heightened awareness of climate change and the rising cost of fossil fuels. </p> <p>And it is poised for a boom: according to the analysts Library House, venture capital investment in European cleantech companies went from \u00a3407m in 2006 to \u00a3805m last year. Ben Goldsmith of WHEB Ventures, an investment firm specialising in environmental businesses, says that globally the figures are even more impressive: \"around $850m in 2004 against $6bn in 2007\".</p> <p>Clean technology represents more of a theme than a specific sector, says Patrick Sheehan, a partner at the Environmental Technologies Fund. He says that waves of investment in the arena have come and gone for more than 20 years, and identifies the most recent as starting with investors in the US, mainly those used to dealing with technological startups in Silicon Valley, around 2004.</p> <p><strong>Changing views</strong> </p> <p>At the time, there was a debate among environmentalists on how to pitch the problem of climate change to the public. \"There was a shift from the negative \u2013 we've got to stop climate change happening and it'll be a disaster and we've got to stop flying on holiday \u2013 to the positive \u2013 we can build a whole new industry around efficiency and a low-carbon economy,\" says Goldsmith.<br>In Europe, governments were sympathetic to the green cause. </p> <p>\"Europe has a pretty rich heritage of environmental awareness and concern from Scandinavia downwards, and that's enabled legislators to begin to do something about it,\" says Sheehan. Mechanisms such as the EU's emissions trading scheme, which allows companies to trade permits to emit carbon dioxide as part of their work, have helped improve the economic viability of (generally more expensive) clean technologies.</p> <p>Also key were the globetrotting efforts of Al Gore and the highly regarded economic analysis of the impacts of a warming world by Nicholas Stern in 2006. \"In the space of the last two years, climate change has moved from the periphery to the mainstream and oil prices have become a major concern. Energy security has become a major issue and you've got, from Europe, a whole raft of legislation around these subjects,\" says Sheehan. <br>Enter the investment funds. \"There are those that see cleantech just as renewable energy,\" says Goldsmith. </p> <p>\"If you look at some of the large US west coast venture funds, who perhaps have their expertise in semiconductors and IT technologies, they can more easily move their focus to things like solar PV and the high-tech renewable energy stuff.\"</p> <p><strong>Linking the chain</strong></p> <p>Library House, in collaboration with the Carbon Trust, proposes the idea that cleantech can be divided into four parts along the energy chain: the discovery and development of new energy sources; generation of clean power; the infrastructure needed to store and distribute energy; and, finally, more efficient use of energy by consumers.</p> <p>Much of the first part of the spectrum relates to biofuels. In most cases, this refers to biodiesel or bioethanol currently made from food crops such as corn, sugarcane and rapeseed \u2013 collectively known as first-generation biofuels. \"Next-generation biofuels will be able to use a wider range of organic material or biomass including current waste material,\" says Richard White, a senior analyst at Library House. </p> <p>\"This will lead to a much greater yield of fuel per square metre of crop, and potentially the ability to grow biofuels where food crops would not grow, alleviating many of the criticisms associated with current biofuel.\"</p> <p>The next part of the energy chain, developing cleaner energy sources, is probably the most familiar to those outside the cleantech world. This includes extraction of energy from renewable sources such as the wind, sun and sea. The British government has committed to source 15% of its primary energy from renewable sources by 2020; that's around 40% of the country's electricity.</p> <p><strong>The tide is high</strong></p> <p>Wind turbines are a relatively mature technology, with several gigawatts of farms in planning stages around the UK. In addition, the country has high hopes for tidal power \u2013 experts estimate there could be up to 15GW of reliable power waiting to be harvested, and the Carbon Trust estimates that the global opportunities in the field could be up to \u00a3600bn. \"For the UK, the group of wet renewables \u2013 offshore wind, tidal stream and wave \u2013 are where the UK can have a global leadership role,\" said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK.</p> <p>Solar power is one of the most established clean technology industries, but efficiency and manufacturing costs need to improve. Current solar panels rely on relatively expensive silicon chips but cutting-edge research includes work on ways to concentrate light, applying thin films of light absorbers to flexible surfaces and using nanotechnology to manipulate materials so that they can better harness the energy from the sun.</p> <p>Energy storage is also key when increasing amounts of power are generated from intermittent sources. \"When energy is produced and not required, it can be stored and released in periods of high demand or when the sun is not shining,\" said White. </p> <p>Further along the chain, better distribution and management of energy \u2013 the \"smart grid\" \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 will lead to more efficiency. \"The smart grid allows energy generators (power stations, solar farms) and consuming loads (your kettle, TV, etc) to interact with each other in real time, in both directions, with the aid of modern communications technology,\" says White.</p> <p>At end of the energy chain are developments based on more efficient use of power. These range from better insulation for buildings, through more efficient electronics in appliances, to improved monitoring of energy, using smart meters. \"Some of the companies in this field may be semiconductor companies at heart, but their developments have the potential for huge energy savings, giving them cleantech credentials,\" said White. </p> <p>\"Common devices such as televisions, lighting, fridges and computers all contribute significantly to energy use, and there is significant room for innovation to curb consumption in these areas.\" Greener transport (electric cars, fuel cells and other hybrids) also falls into this final bracket.</p> <p><strong>Broad spectrum</strong></p> <p>Besides the spectrum outlined by Library House, Goldsmith adds the efficient use of other resources such as technologies to handle the re-use of waste, water efficiency, pipelines and agricultural water use. \"Cleantech is learning to live within the resources of the planet,\" he says.</p> <p>But it will not all be plain sailing for the new climate-saving industries. Big projects can be hamstrung by local problems \u2013 such as wind farms in the UK held up for up to a decade by planning and grid connection hassles. And carbon-intensive markets also lack pull for new, green technologies. </p> <p>\"We can't generalise from IT, mobiles and so on, where they were offering new functionality in an essentially unregulated area, and translate that over to energy where there are incumbents who have been performing these functions as cheaply as they can in a market driven by cost,\" said Parr. \"It's going to need some political drive and will to re-arrange the deckchairs so that new technologies are in with a shout.\"</p> <p>Sheehan reckons it will take only a few years for clean technology to make up the largest chunk of the investors' money. \"We're at the early stages of some profound changes and there will be some new technologies that will surprise people... I've been in venture capital since 1985 and where we are now in cleantech reminds me of where we were in the IT sector in the early 1990s: at the start of a very long growth period.\"</p>",
  "<p>Late last week a schoolroom in central Tanzania descended into chaos after female pupils began to faint. Slumping over their exam papers or collapsing to the floor, 20 girls rapidly lost consciousness. Others sobbed, yelled and ran around the school. Such events, said the local education officer, are \"very common here\". In all likelihood, no organic cause will be found and the episode will be chalked up as yet another case of mass hysteria.</p> <p>Similar outbreaks have recently been reported in locations from Kuala Lumpur to Mexico City and rural Bangladesh. Nor is the west immune. Schools in Europe and the US have also been struck by contagions of vomiting, itching, dizziness and seizures. In fact, mass hysteria seems to be part of the human condition. And it has a rich, bizarre, and often tragic history. </p> <p>Epidemics of hysteria such as those in Tanzania rely on the power of suggestion, but they are nourished by fear, sadness and anxiety. Victims tend to be subject to severe psychological strain over the preceding weeks or months. One or more then develop a psychosomatic symptom, and those made suggestible by pent-up anxiety quickly follow suit. Before long, dozens are vomiting, fainting and screaming. The strain of exams is a common trigger. Reports suggest that in many Central African schools pupils are placed under such extreme pressure that mass hysteria has become virtually endemic. Severe discipline and emotional neglect also seem to have caused the dramatic scenes in a convent school in Mexico City last year when dozens of young girls temporarily lost the ability to walk. </p> <p>Sometimes the reaction of the authorities makes things worse. At a school in Blackburn in 1965, several girls fainted during morning assembly. Concerned that they might hurt themselves, the teachers asked them to lie down on the floor along a main corridor. This made the situation seem far more serious than it was, and other children became convinced that they too were sick. By midday, 141 pupils were experiencing dizziness, nausea, spasms and shortness of breath. Ambulances took 85 children to hospital. It took more than a week to establish that there was no underlying physical condition. </p> <p>Women and girls are nearly always over represented among the victims of these outbreaks. In fact a gender imbalance is often a giveaway that the epidemic is not organic. In more misogynistic times, this was put down to women having more fragile nerves, or wombs with a tendency to rise out of the pelvis and compress other organs. But while there may be a biological component, most experts now think that in many parts of the world, girls and women are more likely to succumb due to the frustrations of living in families and societies dominated by men. Others argue that hysteria offers distressed women a legitimate reason to \"check out\" for a while from the drudgery and indignities of daily life. </p> <p>The manner of psychological breakdowns also varies dramatically from place to place. Take the epidemic of laughing and crying that struck villages west of Lake Victoria in 1962. It began at a mission school when 95 out of 159 girls succumbed to the same painful compulsion to laugh and sob by turns. The authorities sent the children back to their villages, which spread the psychic contagion to the adult population. Victims laughed for about a week on average - hundreds of people were affected before the epidemic receded the following year. </p> <p>A medical team visited the region to study blood, water and food under the microscope. Drawing a blank, they concluded that the sufferers were victims of heightened suggestibility. The schoolchildren had been preparing for important exams and, in those fraught post-independence years, many of their parents were anxious about their region's future. To the doctors who studied the laughter epidemic the events were reminiscent of a far stranger and darker phenomenon: the dancing plague. </p> <p>Perhaps the most bizarre of all mass hysterias, dancing plagues illustrate how the expression of mass hysteria can be shaped by the experiences and beliefs of its victims. On about half a dozen occasions between 1017 and 1518, bouts of uncontrollable dancing struck parts of Germany, Switzerland, France and the Low Countries. Hundreds were consumed by an irresistible urge to dance, hop and leap into the air. </p> <p>Chronicles of 1374 tell of large numbers of men and women dancing, while screeching with pain, leaping into the air, running wildly from place to place, and calling on the mercy of God and the saints. In the year 1518, about 400 citizens of Strasbourg danced for days or weeks in succession. This time the authorities intensified the epidemic by encouraging the afflicted to keep dancing in the misguided belief that doing so would cure them. They had the dancers taken to a specially constructed stage where musicians played pipes and drums and hired dancers held them tight to prevent them from flagging. Soon people were dying of exhaustion. </p> <p>As is typical of episodes of mass hysteria, those afflicted were suffering acute physical and mental distress. The 1374 outbreak occurred just after a devastating flood. During another outbreak in 1518, the inhabitants of Strasbourg were reeling from severe famine, their morale already shattered by syphilis, smallpox and plague. They danced in their misery because people living along the Rhine and Moselle rivers had a longstanding fear of devils and saints who inflicted a terrible, compulsive dance. Having fallen into a trance state, they acted in accordance with these supernaturalist beliefs: dancing wildly for days on end. </p> <p>Supernaturalism has fuelled most flamboyant cases of mass hysteria. Nuns living in austere convents between the 1500s and 1700s were especially prone. Convinced that they had been possessed by demons, unhappy nuns would enter a trance, and proceed to writhe, convulse, laugh, speak in strange tongues, smash crucifixes, thrust out their hips, and make other lewd gestures and propositions. The sociologist Robert E Bartholomew tells of one episode in which several nuns, who presumably saw cats as Satanic familiars, \"meowed together every day at a certain time for several hours together\". In 1749, a contagion of squirming, screaming and trance spread through a German convent; locals inferred the work of a witch, seized a nun as a likely candidate and beheaded her in the marketplace. </p> <p>In modern Singapore and Malaysia, factory workers are often rural migrants who share traditional beliefs about spirits and possession. When a worker, unable to cope with the factory regime, plunges into an altered state, others perceive the action of evil spirits and, in consequence, reproduce the symptoms. Such outbreaks are often brought to an end with the ritual sacrificing of a goat. </p> <p>Epidemics of odd behaviour can also afflict the fully conscious. A striking example is koro. Thousands of men in south-east Asia and China, in times of economic uncertainty, can come to believe that their penises are shrinking into their bodies and that death will ensue if they become fully retracted. The victims of penis panics arrive at medical clinics clutching their genitals, or use pegs, clamps, even needles, to prevent further shrinkage. In China, where koro last appeared in 1985, there is a widespread fear of a fox spirit that roams the land in search of male victims. </p> <p>It takes only the right kind of fear, suggestion and false belief to trigger epidemic hysteria or mass delusions. So as our fears change, so do expressions of mass hysteria. Following the use of poison gas in the first world war, residents of rural Virginia began to report unpleasant physical reactions to noxious gases said to have been released into their homes by a \"mad gasser\". It turned out that anxious locals had fallen sick after misconstruing the smells caused by backed-up flues and even flatulence. A similar wave of nausea and dizziness occurred in a Rhode Island elementary school during the first Gulf war in response to media speculation about possible chemical weapon attacks on Israel. </p> <p>Outbreaks of hysteria closely track real threats and involve credible sets of symptoms. Experts such as Bartholomew and Simon Wessley...#65279; have shown how escalating fears of terrorist attacks have led to an upsurge in physical reactions to harmless powders in envelopes and innocuous odours in subways. </p> <p>But a dose of caution is required. If dozens of schoolchildren begin complaining of faintness, nausea and headaches it is not always time to call in a psychiatrist. When several children fell ill in a London primary school in 1990 it looked just like a case of mass hysteria. There were even more girls than boys on the sick list. But on examination of their school lunch it turned out that they had been poisoned by pesticides used on cucumbers. It seems that the girls were just better at eating their greens.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A Time to Dance, A Time to Die: The Extraordinary Story of the Dancing Plague of 1518 by John Waller is published by Icon Books, priced \u00a312.99.

  "<h2>Teenager accused of killing Rhys Jones named</h2> <p>A teenager accused of murdering 11-year-old Rhys Jones was yesterday named as Sean Mercer after he lost the protection of juvenile status when he turned 18. Mercer, from Croxteth, Liverpool, is expected to stand trial next month. Rhys was shot in the neck as he walked through a pub car park in August last year. James Yates, 20, of Croxteth, and Gary Kays, 25, and Melvin Coy, 24, both of West Derby, Liverpool, are charged along with two boys aged 16 and 17 with assisting an offender. Another 17-year-old is charged with assisting an offender and possessing a firearm and ammunition. <br><strong>Helen Carter</strong></p> <h2>Rare Saxon gold pointer mistaken for bottle top</h2> <p>A rare Saxon 9th century gold pointer which was found at Aughton, South Yorkshire, by Tim Pearson, a metal detector enthusiast who first thought it was a milk bottle top, is expected to fetch up to \u00a315,000 at auction next month. The relic, which is 31mm (1.2in) high and weighs 4.12g (0.15oz), is known as an aestel and was used by monks to help them read manuscripts. It is thought to date from the time of King Alfred (871-899). Madeleine Perridge, of Bonhams antiquities department, said: \"Anyone with a love of history and literature knows that they are in touch with monastic scholarly endeavour.\" <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Woman dies after eating wild mushrooms</h2> <p>A woman has died and another is seriously ill in hospital after they ate wild mushrooms picked during a day trip to a public garden. The surviving woman, in her 20s, picked handfuls of the fungi when she visited the Ventnor botanic gardens, on the Isle of Wight, with her husband on Sunday. A day later she and a relative in her 40s ate them. Police were called yesterday to an address in Newport where they found the older woman, who was pronounced dead by paramedics. An hour later the other woman was found at an address nearby. She is said to be conscious in hospital on the island. <br><strong>Solent News</strong></p> <h2>Councils collect food waste to feed the land</h2> <p>A total of 4,400 tonnes of food waste was ploughed back into the land after being composted, government waste advisers said yesterday. Over 94,000 homes in 19 local authorities in England and Northern Ireland put food scraps in bins which were collected for composting. According to Wrap, the organisation advising the government on the pilot project, the compost has been used in farming and horticultural schemes, and in redeveloping reclaimed land. Two local authorities taking part, South Shropshire and Mid Bedfordshire, put the waste collected through a process which can create renewable energy. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Poll to pick heroes in fight against Halloween</h2> <p>Children are to be given the chance to vote for the UK's most heroic job as part of a campaign against the \"dark\" side of Halloween, it was announced yesterday. The online survey will give children 25 jobs to choose from, including taxi drivers, supermarket workers, footballers, doctors and parents. The poll, run with the Children's Society, and launched in Manchester by the Bishop of Middleton, the Rt Rev Mark Davies, is part of a campaign against the \"dark and negative\" side of Halloween. The survey aims to encourage a greater emphasis on All Saints' Day, November 1, as a celebration of heroes and saints. <br><strong>Press Assocation</strong></p> <h2>Protest violence grounds forced repatriation</h2> <p>An attempt to deport 50 failed Iraqi-Kurd asylum seekers on a German charter flight from Stansted airport this week had to be abandoned after handcuffed detainees cracked a window in the plane. The Home Office said it was punched. Fazzell Abdul-Ahmed, who had previously led a protest hunger strike, claims he was physically mistreated and his face accidentally smashed into the window. The men, collected from four detention centres early on Monday, had their mobile phones confiscated before they could call friends and each was escorted by a security guard. <br><strong>Owen Bowcott</strong></p> <h2>Man charged over supermarket knife attack</h2> <p>A 21-year-old man was last night charged with attempted murder following a frenzied knife attack on a young woman in a supermarket, police said. Samuel Reid-Wentworth was arrested on Tuesday shortly after the incident at the Somerfield store in Littlehampton, West Sussex. His alleged victim, a 21-year-old woman from the town, is in a critical but stable condition in hospital in Southampton after what detectives described as a \"random and motiveless\" attack. Witnesses saw the woman being stabbed repeatedly before her assailant was tackled by a security guard. <br><strong>Alex Berry</strong></p>",
  "<p>It is hard to envisage anything topping the level of home support Darren Clarke received in Ireland's Ryder Cup two years ago but Kentuckians will be at their boisterous best when one of their own, Kenny Perry, steps on to the first tee tomorrow morning. Despite being a multimillionaire, Perry, who is expected to partner his fellow Kentuckian JB Holmes in the opening match, shares the same values as others from his home state: friendliness, generosity and a love of golf. It is why he built his home town a subsidised course on which to play.</p> <p>Before Perry's emergence Franklin, a small town of 8,000 people nestled in the hills of south Kentucky, was most famed for hosting the wedding of Johnny Cash and June Carter in 1968. It was in the same year that Kenny Perry Sr, whose own father was the town's mayor, bought his son his first set of golf clubs at the age of eight, a bag which now hangs proudly alongside those of Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup vintage in the clubhouse of Kenny Perry's Country Creek Golf Course. \"They're rather tatty now and people can't believe he used those for five or six years,\" says Perry Sr, known by the club's 50 members simply as Mr Perry.</p> <p>The 85-year-old second world war veteran can be found at the course every morning picking up balls from the driving range, and his daughter Lydia works in the pro shop, one of 11 staff employed by her brother, who is of course the club's inadvertent star attraction. \"Kenny practises on the driving range and putts along with the rest of the guys on the practice green,\" says the club's director of golf, Greg Nugent. \"When the course is busy it can be difficult for him because he always wants to stop and say hello to everyone. He's very accessible and humble.\"</p> <p>Perry, who qualified for his second Ryder Cup at the age of 48 by winning three events this year, built the course in 1995 at a cost of $4m [\u00a32.2m] but charges only $28 including buggy hire for the privilege of playing at the beautiful venue. \"The reason it's so inexpensive is because Kenny paid for the course himself and all the revenue goes back into its maintenance, not profit,\" says Nugent. \"It was a gift to the community and anyone can come and play. He gives back more than you can imagine but does it behind the scenes and doesn't draw attention to himself.\"</p> <p>Nugent tells the tale of how Perry was given $5,000 by one of his church elders so that he could have a third and final crack at PGA Tour qualifying school in 1986, on the condition that should he be successful he would pay a percentage of his subsequent winnings to Lipscomb University, the Christian college in Nashville from which he and his wife graduated. He obtained his tour card and has since donated 5% of his approximately $26m career prize money to the university, or $1.3m. </p> <p>Similarly his father tells how he donated $125,000 to found a boys' and girls' club in Franklin to provide children with the sort of activities that were never available to him when he was growing up. All the same, Perry Sr was never worried his son might go off the rails through boredom.</p> <p>\"He never smoked, never drank bourbon, never told a dirty joke,\" Perry Sr says with a strong southern accent and a cigar in his mouth. \"I tell him: 'Son, you're just like your mother.' His mother was easy-going and Kenny takes after her. </p> <p>\"It's nice for him still to be in the country here. Here he can let his hair down, relax and talk about golf and old cars, which are his thing. The only times he gets into trouble is with the police over the speed he drives them. But they don't give him a ticket because of who he is.\"</p> <p>Tickets are a bone of contention at Country Creek. To boost his player's allocation of 20, Perry bought a further 30 for friends in Franklin for $6,000. When he revealed on Tuesday that he had managed to obtain even more after a request in an interview he gave, \"they were gone within five minutes\", according to Nugent. </p> <p>\"I took about 100 calls for tickets. Everyone in Franklin has been trying to buy them - it will be a pretty empty town this weekend. They just love Kenny.\" They will make that apparent tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is engaged in a \"generational struggle\" to defeat the Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan, Des Browne, the defence secretary, warned yesterday.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian before a meeting of Nato defence ministers in London today, he called for an \"honest discussion\" about the problems facing the alliance, notably its inability to deploy adequate forces and failure to invest in needed equipment, and the need to \"transform\" Nato. It was the most successful military alliance the world had ever seen, he said. But it was set up to fight the cold war-type conflicts rather than the expeditionary type operations currently being fought in Afghanistan, and that was something the 26 defence ministers needed to address.</p> <p>Just 10% of the infrastructure of Nato headquarters in Brussels was devoted to actual military operations, Browne said. And most European countries possessed \"static non-deployable forces\".</p> <p>British commanders in Afghanistan have for years asked for more helicopters to move soldiers around relatively safely, and aircraft to supply them with equipment more quickly. Browne said there were many hundreds of helicopters in Europe, but they were not deployable. They didn't have adequate protection and their crews were not trained to special forces levels. He was discussing with other European countries, in particular France, ways to share helicopter resources.</p> <p>Officials and military commanders in Afghanistan say the Taliban and other insurgent groups are in control of more and more territory and that at best the battle against them has reached stalemate. Browne said: \"In Helmand province the Afghan government has a significant presence and a degree of control in every single part of where the people live in any concentration. What people who talk about stalemate mean is that we control that area now ... we have to concentrate on holding and maintaining what we have achieved. We will never be able to expand beyond that unless we can, as it were, backfill with a combination of the Afghan army and their own governance and economic development.\" </p> <p>It was a challenge he made no bones about, he said. To reach a state when the Afghans had \"ownership of their own security\" was going to take time. How long? \"It will be a generational struggle,\" he said. Two generations of Afghans had been denied access to education and law. </p> <p>Browne suggested that Nato should cooperate more effectively in future with organisations including the EU, which he described as having \"complementary capabilities\", the UN, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>He will raise concern growing among British military commanders and in Whitehall about US military tactics in Afghanistan with Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, who is attending the London meeting called by Browne. An increasing number of Afghan civilians are being killed in US bombing raids.</p> <p>According to defence sources, more British special forces are being deployed to Afghanistan in operations against Taliban in the south. Asked about US cross-border operations in Pakistan, Browne said: \"We have no intention of going into Pakistan.\" The insurgency in Afghanistan was a \"shared problem\" with Pakistan.</p> <p>There was no prospect of Nato military intervention in Georgia, he said.</p>",
  "<p>Nepalese Gurkhas who fought with the British army but retired before their regimental headquarters moved to the UK from Hong Kong in 1997, do not have strong ties to the country and have no right to settle in it, a Home Office lawyer told a judge in the high court yesterday. </p> <p>Five Gurkha veterans who have been refused settlement visas on the grounds that they have no strong ties to the UK, challenged the decision in court in a test case that could have implications for more than 2,000 of their fellow former soldiers. </p> <p>Steven Kovats, for the Home Office, said Gurkhas discharged after 1997 were treated differently because the move of their base to the UK enabled them to form closer ties with the country. When the current immigration policy was introduced in 2004, the Gurkhas discharged before 1997 had been absent from the UK for more than seven years. Those who retired after 1997 and with four years service have the right to stay in the UK. </p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Blake, asked whether a Gurkha who had won a Victoria Cross but had no strong ties with the country would still be eligible to settle in the UK. \"Having a VC is not necessarily a strong tie bringing the entry application within the policy,\" replied Kovats. </p> <p>Kovats said under immigration rules, two years' absence from the UK precluded anyone granted indefinite leave to remain from having it routinely renewed on return. The Gurkhas' legal team says they have been racially discriminated against because other foreign soldiers who have served four years are allowed to live in the UK after their service. Kovats rejected this saying government policy did not discriminate between the two groups.</p> <p>He went on: \"The claimants in effect assert that Crown service is itself a sufficient tie with the UK. But this has never been British immigration policy.\" </p> <p>The judge reserved his ruling until a later date.</p>",
  "<p>Children under 18 should be banned from using sunbeds, doctors said today following a major review into the link between sunbeds and skin cancer.</p> <p>They reviewed published research on the health effects of ultraviolet radiation and found clear evidence that using sunbeds or prolonged exposure to sunlight in childhood raises the risk of people developing skin cancer later in life.</p> <p>A ban on under 18s using sunbeds should be accompanied by a clampdown on advertising campaigns that claim they are safe to use, the doctors added. </p> <p>Writing in the journal Pigment Cell and Melanoma Research, doctors at St George's Hospital Medical School in London, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and the University of New Mexico Cancer Centre conclude: \"UV radiation exposure is one of the most avoidable causes of cancer risk and mortality in man. Whereas genetic and other factors undoubtedly contribute importantly to skin cancer risk, the role of UV is incontrovertible, and efforts to confuse the public, particularly for purposes of economic gain by the indoor tanning industry, should be vigorously combated for the public health.\" </p> <p>The researchers also highlight studies that suggest skin only develops a tan as a direct response to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation, implying there is no such thing as a \"safe\" tan.</p> <p>Dorothy Bennett, professor of cell biology at St George's Hospital Medical School in London, who authored one of three related papers in the journal, says: \"There is very clear evidence that UV radiation is able to cause mutations and also to cause skin cancer. We know that people who have used a sunbed before the age of 35 have a 75% increased risk of skin cancer.\"</p> <p>More than 150,000 children under 16 have used sunbeds in Britain, according to a survey conducted earlier this year by the consumer association Which? That is despite recently updated guidelines from the Health and Safety Executive to ban under 18s from using sunbeds, and a recommendation from the industry body, The Sunbed Association, that its members refuse to accept the custom of anyone under the age of 16.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Scottish MSPs voted to ban under 18s from using sunbeds, a move the Department of Health is considering under its ongoing Cancer Reform Strategy.</p> <p>According to Cancer Research UK, cases of skin cancer in the UK have nearly tripled since the 1980s, with women more likely to develop the disease than men. </p> <p>The charity estimates that around 100,000 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer are diagnosed each year, with a further 8,900 cases of the more dangerous melanoma skin cancer recorded. More than 2,300 people die from skin cancer in the UK each year. </p> <p>Of patients diagnosed with skin cancer in Britain in 2000, 78% of men and 91% of women survived for five years. The lifetime risk of skin cancer for men is 1 in 147, and 1 in 117 for women. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for The Sunbed Association said: \"There's no medical or scientific evidence to support raising the age people can use a sunbed from 16 to 18 years old. If there was any evidence to support that, we would enforce it in our salons.\" Around a quarter of Britain's 6,000 tanning salons are members of the association.</p> <p>A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"The Government strongly discourages the use of sunbeds for cosmetic purposes, especially by minors. The Cancer Reform Strategy reaffirmed our commitment to a review of options for possible regulation of the sunbed industry. Firstly we propose gathering more information about the number and distribution of sunbeds and the scale of sunbed use by young people.\"</p> <p>Caroline Cerny, Cancer Research UK's SunSmart campaign manager, said: \"Overexposure to UV rays, whether from sunbathing or using sunbeds, simply is not good for our skin. This review supports the body of evidence that UV radiation causes long-term skin damage, which could eventually lead to cancer.</p> <p>\"Cancer Research UK's SunSmart campaign provides advice on how to enjoy the sun safely and stresses the importance of making sure you never burn. We are also calling on the government to introduce legislation to regulate the sunbed industry to restrict under 18s from using sunbeds.\"</p> <p>Some exposure to sunlight is needed for the body to synthesise healthy levels of vitamin D, though Prof Bennett said 15 minutes in the sunshine with only the face and arms exposed is enough. People who have very low levels of vitamin D are more likely to develop bowel cancer, heart disease and bone disorders, according to recent research.</p>",
  "<p>Condoleezza Rice recently returned empty-handed from <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-israel-rice_greenbergaug26,0,4123326.story\">yet another round of meetings in the Middle East</a>. After nearly eight years of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/israelandthepalestinians.usforeignpolicy\">sub-par US leadership</a>, the peace process has stalled, and the Middle East faces a host of regional issues such as a burgeoning food crisis, the destabilising threat of Iraqi refugees pouring into neighbouring countries, nuclear proliferation and the uncertain effects of globalisation.</p> <p>The US secretary of state's unproductive visit serves to underscore the inadequate nature of current US efforts - in a sense, trying to draw blood from a stone in a situation where the prospects for advances on key bilateral fronts like the Israeli-Palestinian peace process are slim. </p> <p>But there is a track of the peace process that has been dormant for the past eight years and that offers the prospect of both advancing the peace process and coordinating a regional approach to the challenges confronting the Middle East: multilateral negotiations.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Conference\">international conference in Madrid</a> in 1991 established the foundation for the Middle East peace process. The US and the Soviet Union convened the conference as the first step in a process to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, initiate bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and Arab states and begin multilateral negotiations on transnational issues confronting the Middle East.</p> <p>At a subsequent conference in Moscow the following year, the 36 participants organised the multilateral track into <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/multitoc.html\">five working groups</a> to focus on particular regional issues: arms control and regional security, water issues, environment, refugees and economic development. A steering committee organised the negotiations and oversaw the operations of the working groups. Syria and Lebanon boycotted, claiming that bilateral settlements were a prerequisite for multilateral negotiations.</p> <p>Despite holding meetings throughout the 1990s, the multilateral track did not produce many tangible results. There were no large agreements on a coordinated approach to water or environmental issues, and negotiations often bogged down over controversial issues such as Palestinian representation. Despite a lack of successes, however, the multilateral track was not a failure. For one, these talks helped to erase the stigma against negotiation prevalent in the region. Just 20 years ago, the notion of the Arab states engaging in negotiations with Israel would have seemed to be starry-eyed dreaming. </p> <p>Today, restarting the multilateral working groups offers a chance to reinvigorate the stagnant peace process and confront the challenges facing the Middle East. Moreover, the issues the working groups address are more relevant than ever.</p> <p>The Middle East's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/764142.stm\">water shortages</a> continue, and exacerbate the food shortages plaguing many Arab states. In Israel and Egypt, scientists and farmers are developing new methods of countering desertification and <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/19/MN34TPJ51.DTL\">growing crops in desert conditions</a>. This research should be available to all countries in the region through the water and environment working groups, and coordinating projects could make the research more efficient. Arab regimes, facing growing popular discontent with rising food prices, have ample incentives to participate in the working groups.</p> <p>There is also cause to restart the arms control and regional security working group. Iran's regional ascendance and the murky goals of its nuclear programme are a shared threat (or at least area of concern) for Israel and the Arab states. Israel clearly perceives Iran as a more pressing threat than do the Arab states, but it is an opportunity to use the arms control and regional security working group to develop a coordinated strategy to confront the threat.</p> <p>The issue of refugees is a particularly sticky subject, as any negotiation quickly turns to the status of Palestinian refugees. But the potentially <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58648-2005Feb2.html\">destabilising effects of Iraqi refugee populations</a> in Syria, Jordan, the Gulf States and elsewhere demands swift, coordinated action. Tasking the refugee working group with developing a strategy for dealing with Iraqi refugees is one way to convene the group without immediately bogging it down in the Palestinian refugee issue.</p> <p>Globalisation and the latest oil boom are transforming the region and filling the coffers of some Gulf States. But for the states without oil wealth, the economic future is dimmer. Following the dismal assessment of the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/regionalreports/arabstates/name,3140,en.html\">2002 Arab Human Development Report</a>, Middle Eastern states have refocused on education reform as the key to adapting to globalisation. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are each experimenting with new education initiatives. The economic development working group should take up these issues, share information on education reform and discuss the best methods for economic development in the region.</p> <p>If the multilateral negotiations are re-branded as venue for confronting regional challenges, they will both advance the peace process and help to solve regional issues. Transnational threats - presently abundant the Middle East - are powerful incentives for Arab states and Israel to overcome lingering reticence for negotiations and begin cooperating in a way that will build confidence and advance the peace process.</p>",
  "<p>Members of Israel's ruling Kadima party are today voting for a new leader, with opinion polls suggesting that the foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, could become the country's first female prime minister in more than 30 years.</p> <p>Opinion polls put Livni, a former Mossad agent and lawyer with only a decade's experience in politics, some way ahead of her closest challenger, the transport minister and hawkish former army chief Shaul Mofaz. </p> <p>If she wins and forms a government, she would be the first female prime minister since Golda Meir resigned in 1974.</p> <p>However, analysts warned that the vote would be difficult to call. Polls are open until late tonight, and a result is not expected before early tomorrow.</p> <p>If one candidate wins more than 40% of the vote, they will then be given 42 days to form a coalition government. If no coalition is agreed then new elections must be held within three months. </p> <p>Until then, the prime minister, Ehud Olmert - who is facing several corruption investigations and has promised to resign after the vote - would probably stay on as a caretaker.</p> <p>Around 74,000 members of Kadima are eligible to vote, and a low turnout might favour Mofaz, whose campaign is thought to have been better organised. </p> <p>Israel's Ynet news website said only 28% of voters had turned out by 6pm local time, but more were expected for the last four hours of voting.</p> <p>Livni voted in Tel Aviv and encouraged others to turn out, saying: \"You can determine today what the character of Kadima will be.\" </p> <p>\"You can determine today if you really have had enough of old-time politics. Come and vote, bring your children, and show them how you are changing the country.\"</p> <p>Mofaz, as he has often done in recent weeks, emphasised his security background as a former general and defence minister. </p> <p>\"The state of Israel stands before major challenges in the coming years and needs a strong leader who has the courage to decide and the ability to act,\" he told Israeli Army Radio. </p> <p>On Sunday, he predicted he would win the vote, even promising to take the election with exactly 43%.</p> <p>One of the most recent polls, carried out for the Ma'ariv newspaper on Monday, suggested the gap between the two leading contenders was shrinking but still put Livni well ahead on 42.5% against Mofaz on 30.4%. </p> <p>The two other candidates, the internal security minister, Avi Dichter, and Meir Sheetrit, the tourism minister, are a long way behind.<br> If none of the candidates reaches 40%, a run-off vote will be held next week.</p> <p>Although Livni, 50, and 59-year-old Mofaz are from the same party, there are marked differences in their views. </p> <p>Livni has been closely involved in the last year of negotiations with the Palestinians, and is expected to continue the process if she wins. She argues in favour of a Palestinian state, but is adamantly opposed to the return of a single Palestinian refugee into what is now Israel. </p> <p>Mofaz has been much more sceptical about the idea of talks with the Palestinians - last week he told an Israeli newspaper the negotiations had been a \"waste of time\" - but supports the idea of a two-state solution to the conflict. </p> <p>He has also taken a much tougher line on Iran and its nuclear ambitions, saying earlier this year that he thought war was \"unavoidable\".</p> <p>Some Israeli commentators have been distinctly unimpressed. Sima Kadmon, writing in today's Yedioth Ahronoth, said she thought both lacked charisma and leadership ability. </p> <p>\"It is not an easy choice. Choosing between Tzipi Livni and Shaul Mofaz is like choosing between two shades of grey,\" she wrote.</p>",
  "<p>If you are reading these words while in the middle of a long and complicated day at work then spare a thought for Jack Durkin, Paul Curtis and Al Blagman, the three-man ice crew for the New York Rangers. By the time today becomes tomorrow these three likeable, garrulous men will have put in a 16 hour shift in order that the floor of Madison Square Garden, the self-styled \"World's Most Famous Arena\", becomes a sheet of ice.</p> <p>The National Hockey League season may not begin in earnest until the puck drops between the Rangers and the Tampa Bay Lightning in Prague and the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Ottawa Senators in Stockholm on Saturday October 4, but for a legion of working men in 30 NHL cities all over north America the campaign begins this week. For this is the time when paint will be sprayed, logos stencilled, lines drawn and water frozen.</p> <p>Of course, some places have it easier than others. Toronto's Air Canada Centre has a dehumidifier in order to keep the ice in pristine condition, a development that has done nothing whatsoever to prevent the Maple Leafs from being a transcontinental embarrassment. Down in Miami, home of the similarly awful Florida Panthers, the ice men have to contend with temperatures of 90 degrees and air that is the consistency of pea and ham soup. But more than any other arena in the NHL, it is the crew at Madison Square Garden who face the greatest obstacles when it comes to the art of making men glide on water.</p> <p>Last night, MSG was the venue for the second of two Celine Dion concerts. On Thursday, the women's basketball team, New York Liberty, will take to the floor for a play-off game against the Connecticut Sun. Between these two dates, Jack, Paul and Al have fewer than 24 hours to lay a sheet of ice on which professional athletes will perform, a sheet of ice that will remain in place until the second month of next year. In February the playing surface will be melted in order that the Garden can stage a track event. Immediately after this, the season's second rink will be frozen into place, and will remain frozen until the end of the New York Rangers' season. So the second round of the playoffs, then.</p> <p>It's always like this at Madison Square Garden. One night it's a Metallica show, the next the rodeo is in town, then the Knicks, then the Rangers; and on and on. Today, MSG's three water wizards began their day at 7am. After the seats from the previous night's concert have been cleared, the floor of the Manhattan arena will be chilled to 9 degrees farenheit. A layer of water will be lain on the surface and then frozen. This will be followed by a coating of water-based white paint, atop which will be stenciled various logos (that of the Rangers, the NHL, plus one or two league sponsors), as well as the blue lines, the red and white line and the face off circles. </p> <p>Then the real work begins, the spraying of 10,000 gallons of cold water onto a painted floor. Directed from hand-held spray guns, this water will fall at a rate of just under one thousand gallons an hour. Any more and the water will form puddles; this will compromise the freezing process and thus the integrity of the ice. From today until the season's end, whenever that may be, it is all about the ice. To the ice men their charge is a living, breathing thing, a thing in which they take pride and which causes them stress and worry.</p> <p>I should at this point confess a personal interest. Last season in this column I stated that Madison Square Garden hosted a terrible skating surface. I said this because I'd read it in a book and assumed it to be true. Trouble is, it isn't. This was pointed out to me first hand in April when I was lucky enough to spend an afternoon in the company of the ice men of the Garden. With a smile, Jack Durkin (a man who was drafted to Salt Lake City in 2002 in order to help prepare the surface for that year's Winter Olympics hockey tournament) introduced himself by asking if I was the expletive deleted who wrote all that expletive deleted.</p> <p>My meeting came about, by the way, because I was contacted by Paul Curtis, who I am flattered to say reads this column. Paul has the distinction of being the NHL's only British ice man. Born in Tooting, south London, he has worked full-time with the Rangers since 2000. Driving 90 minutes to work from his home in Yonkers each day, he and his two colleagues put in the kind of shift that even a hockey player would be impressed by. Empty, Madison Square Garden is freezing, a frigid and still space just waiting for the storm to come. Jack, Paul and Al make sure that this storm, this flurry of finesse and violence that is professional hockey, proceeds as it should. Their job of work begins hours before the puck is dropped, and ends often hours after the final buzzer.</p> <p>Two things about my visit impressed me. The first is just how expert a job tending a slab of frozen water actually is, how their skills combine the virtues of hard graft with the precision of keyhole surgery. Theirs is a thankless task: if the ice is pure, no one notices; yet if the playing surface is bad, it's all they notice. But the ice men of Madison Square Garden point out that the hockey rink to which they tend is marked by NHL officials, and that each season their patch is scored at the top end of the class.</p> <p>But my real abiding memory of my afternoon on the ice \u2013 which occurred prior to Game 3 of the Eastern Conference quarter-finals, where the Rangers were hosting the New Jersey Devils \u2013 were of the ice men themselves. In a rare moment of peace, eating sub-sandwiches in their clubhouse, the job seemed like such a laugh. Upstairs in the press box the talk was of contracts and money, cynical conversations spoken with the kind of easy derision that is perhaps the natural consequence of professional opinion-holders who find themselves privy to too much of a good thing. But down in the clubhouse the talk was of hockey itself, of the game, and of the people who play it rather than the money they earn. It seemed to me then, just as it seems to me now, that the men closest to the ice had the best perspective on what the sport really means.</p> <p>So this week spare a thought for the NHL ice crews, for the teams who work just as hard as the players themselves. They are the men that make one of the world's greatest sports possible. </p> <p>Because the hockey season starts here, with them.</p> <p><em>Postscript: My thanks go to Paul Curtis, who kindly provided all the nuts and bolts information contained in this column. With the season a little over a fortnight away, I'll be back in two weeks in order to make wildly inaccurate predictions concerning the campaign to come. Hope you can join me.</em></p>",

The early symptoms appeared to be shared by all of the main political parties and many in the industry and, by the end of last week in the Scottish media, we had a full-scale epidemic on our hands. The source of the outbreak was quickly identified as broadcasting.</p> <p>No one now seems to disagree that something is seriously wrong with the state of broadcasting in Scotland and the commission has been able to shed some light on the subject - the first time the industry has ever been looked at in this way. </p> <p>Our final report sets out an ambitious and, we think, compelling vision for the future of the industry in the digital age. We talk about the economic, cultural and democratic importance of broadcasting. We paint an optimistic but realistic picture of a transformed production sector creating world-class content for worldwide audiences. We point out that the best way to predict the future is to create it.</p> <p>The headline-grabber from our report (and the cause of much of the consensus) is our idea for a new Scottish network, a public service broadcaster combining a linear television channel with an extensive and innovative online platform. </p> <p>This is in effect a solution to several pressing problems: We need the Scottish network to provide secure and sustainable public service competition for the BBC in Scotland; to produce the greater range and volume of Scottish content that audiences in Scotland clearly desire; and to create outlets for the new talent and new ideas that currently struggle to find broadcast opportunities, from which creators, audiences and markets can all benefit.</p> <p>And the reach of this proposal goes beyond Scotland's borders: the network would of course be available throughout the UK.</p> <p>In fact, much of our vision sees Scotland playing its part in the global and UK markets. The industry is not what it should have been but we know what it can be and what it will take to get it there.</p> <p>Which is why we also had a lot to say about how and why the UK public service broadcasters should commission more of their network television programmes from this part of the country. The BBC have already made a commitment to move its share of spending in Scotland to a level that is more consistent with our share of population (close to 9%). The move is very welcome - although we would like it to move a little faster.</p> <p>We also call on Channel 4 to make a similar commitment and to be less metrocentric in its culture and its commissioning. Outside London, 4 is not so much a brand name as a head count.</p> <p>There were perfectly good reasons - historical and technological - for why broadcasting was always so heavily concentrated in London. But the explanations for the past must not be allowed to become the excuses for the future. The cultural and economic benefits of network television production are so extensive and so obvious that they must be more equitably distributed around the UK by the avowedly public service broadcasters.</p> <p>There is wide recognition in Scotland that more must be done to develop and support the indigenous production sector. Public service interventions of the kind we have outlined can provide the leverage to create companies capable of competing in those fast-growing multimedia, multiplatform and multinational markets.</p> <p>Broadcasting in this part of the UK has consistently lagged behind the other creative industries. Scotland is home to perhaps the world's most successful cultural product (Harry Potter), the world's most successful video game (the Grand Theft Auto series) and the world's biggest and best arts festivals (Edinburgh). In recent years there has been an explosion of creativity in music, visual arts and theatre - we have the UNESCO City of Literature and the UNESCO City of Music. It's time now for television production to catch up - in domestic and global markets.</p> <p>The Scottish Broadcasting Commission made 22 recommendations in all and we are keen to see all of them implemented. But whatever the outcome, it is already clear that the debate about broadcasting in Scotland has moved on to a new level of ambition and engagement. This is a turning point and there is no way back to the neglect and underinvestment of previous years. </p> <p>Having had a warm and wide welcome for our final report in Scotland last week, we now look to Ofcom and the DCMS to endorse our conclusions and take them forward, and to the viewing public and those in the industry to continue to build the sense of momentum. Consensus - it's highly contagious.</p>",
  "<p>When the New York socialite Leona Helmsley died just over a year ago, every <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1560839/Leona-Helmsley.html\">obituary</a> recalled her most famous aphorism \"only little people pay taxes\". Although the convicted felon denied ever saying those words, they ring true when you consider how large firms only hand over a pittance in return for pilfering much of the world's resources.</p> <p>Take the case of Zambia. In 2006, copper production from the country was worth about \u00a32bn, yet the Lusaka government took in a meagre \u00a312m in tax revenues from companies extracting this metal.</p> <p>While the super-rich can stash away their profits in unregulated bank accounts, the little people of the planet are frequently condemned to misery and premature death. The United Nations has estimated that capital flight from poor countries can exceed $600bn per year, over six times what they receive in development aid. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Africa_0808_tax_communique.pdf\">conference (pdf)</a> of tax commissioners in Pretoria last month conference concluded that the total volume of \"hot money\" that left Africa between 1991 and 2004 was the equivalent of nearly 8% of the continent's income. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk\">Christian Aid</a> has calculated that the loss to healthcare systems caused by tax evasion has resulted in about 3 million infants dying unnecessarily so far this decade. </p> <p>European Union governments should not be allowed escape their responsibility for this grotesque level of suffering. Several of the world's most notorious tax havens are either within the EU or on the dependent territory of its member states. These include the City of London, Luxembourg, Cyprus, the Cayman Islands, Jersey and Guernsey.</p> <p>Attempts to rectify this immoral situation have been feeble. In 2005, an <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/personal_tax/savings_tax/savings_directive_review/pres_savingsreport.pdf\">EU-wide savings tax (pdf)</a> directive came into effect, targeting accounts for which interest was earned but not declared. Britain, though, demanded that this law had ample loopholes \u2013 trusts and limited companies are exempt \u2013 in order to placate the pinstriped army that controls the City of London.</p> <p>France, the current holder of the EU's presidency, has <a href=\"http://www.eu2008.fr/webdav/site/PFUE/shared/ProgrammePFUE/Programme_EN.pdf \">said (pdf)</a> it \"will strive to further the efforts aimed at plugging the loopholes\" in the coming months. Good luck to it. </p> <p>Governments taking part in a 2002 international <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/monterrey/MonterreyConsensus.pdf\">conference (pdf)</a> on tackling global poverty in Monterrey, Mexico, undertook to improve the regulation of financial institutions. Like many of the promises made at such gatherings, the pledge has been broken. But when Germany used its leadership of the G8 last year to <a href=\"http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2580513,00.html\">urge</a> greater transparency over hedge funds, Britain and the US rejected its appeal.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/documents/SGreport_25JUL2008.pdf\">follow-up</a> to the Monterrey conference will kick off in Doha, Qatar this November. Ban Ki-Moon, the UN secretary-general, has spoken of a \"renewed interest to address the negative impact of illicit capital flows\" at the event. I wouldn't bet on anything concrete emerging but that doesn't mean I am despondent. </p> <p>Several anti-poverty organisations are planning to make tax evasion a central theme of their advocacy work during 2009. These groups have successfully mobilised the public and politicians on debt relief and aid in the past, so I don't see why they cannot do the same on an issue that is arguably more emotive. If little people are the only ones who pay tax, then they have every reason to holler for change.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Good evening everyone. The bookies reckon this will be a United romp [no references to bawdy tabloid tales here please] and make them 1-2 favourites tonight, but I'm not so sure. Villarreal finished second in La Liga last season, have strengthened in the summer, and are up against an experimental-looking United side that features Jonny Evans alongside Rio Ferdinand at the back and a midfield of Owen Hargreaves, Darren Fletcher, Park Ji Sung and Nani. Cristiano Ronaldo starts on the bench.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Man Utd:</strong> Van der Sar, Neville, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra, Nani,<br>Hargreaves, Fletcher, Park, Rooney, Tevez. <strong>Subs:</strong> Foster, Brown, Ronaldo, Anderson, Giggs, Vidic, O'Shea.</p> <p><strong>Villarreal:</strong> Diego Lopez, Angel, Rodriguez, Godin, Capdevila, Cani, Eguren, Edmilson, Pires, Fernandez, Franco. <strong>Subs:</strong> Viera, Santi Cazorla, Ibagaza, Llorente, Javi Venta, Senna, Fuentes.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Wolfgang Stark (Germany)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Meanwhile to your emails ... </strong> Dave \"a Manc stuck deep in Arsenal territory\" wants to know \"Does anyone know of pub in near Dalston that might show the United match - and where I won't get stabbed?\" Meanwhile Tony Richards claims that Darren Fletcher is the \"most underrated player in Europe\", before adding \"I bet your readers can't think of anyone better who is less appreciated\". Well?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> We're off! Old Trafford doesn't look full but it's certainly boisterous. Gary Neville is also up for it too: he's so focused in the tunnel he even tries to out-stare the TV cameras. <em>And succeeds</em>.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> After barely two minutes, Pires gets first reducer from Owen Hargreaves. He gets up very gingerly indeed, like a wounded wildebeast. It's been a decent start, with Villarreal keeping the ball nicely.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> Nice work from Nani on the left ends with a cross that Godin clears with a flying Superman header.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> Meanwhile this from Jon Cummins. \"Nice to see Fergie still has his ruthless streak,\" he writes. \"Pretty much everyone who played a stinker at Anfield (besides Van Der Sar) is dropped or unavailable. I wonder if Scholes wasn't suspended if he'd get a game tonight?\" Not sure if he's been ruthless or pragmatic, Jon. United travel to Stamford Bridge on Sunday and I'm sure he wants to trial Evans and rest some of his players. Intriguingly Villarreal haven't named their best side either. Anyone would think the opening stages of the Champions League don't really matter. (What? Eh? Etc, etc).</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7 min</strong> The singing continues and so does United's pressure. Nani wriggles inside before his cross goes off for a corner ...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9 min</strong> ... Rooney's back-post cross is flapped at by the Villarreal keeper (who comes, then stops, then stands still) before landing on Ferdinand's unmarked foot five yards out. It hits his heel, rolls across goal, and Villarreal clear.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Meanwhile Andrew Ross has suggestions for not-that-scary Dalston pubs. \"The Yucatan on Kingsland Road/Stoke Newington High Street will have the United and Celtic games on. Check out the garden furniture inside the bar and roguish Irish punters.\" Roguish Irish punters?! Bit of a generalisation that, Andrew.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>13 min</strong> The game has already settled into a predictable pattern: United attacking, Villarreal defending with a 9-0-1 formation. Nani tries a swirler from 30 yards that Lopez fails to handle but no one is following up.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>15 min</strong> It's all United so far. \"Can anyone enlighten me as to where in God's green hell is the \u00a330.2m or whatever Lord Ferg paid to Tottenham for Dimitar Berbatov?\" asks Rodrigo Moya. He's got a knee injury and is watching the game from the stands is the prosaic answer, Rodrigo.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> Early goals so far tonight: Lyon 0-1 Fiorentina, Steaua 0-1 Bayern Munich.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min</strong> Superb turn by Tevez, who is then grabbed with both hands by Rodriguez and wrestled to the ground. Not unreasonably Tevez asks for a yellow card but the referee Wolfgang Stark, a banker by trade, isn't having it.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 min</strong> Nani wins a highly dubious free-kick on the edge of the Villarreal area after tripping over his own shoelaces but, like 19,831 divided by zero, it comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Rooney's 35-yarder smashes into a Villarreal defender. \"Did you make a mint on Cluj last night and what are your top tips for tonight's matches,\" asks George Templeton. I didn't George, but my colleague Barry Glendenning had the princely sum of \u00a38 at 12.5-1 on Cluj and won \u00a3100. Have backed under 1.5 goals tonight at 5-2, and laid Manchester United at 1.52, but it's still early days.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 min</strong> So close for United! Nani plays it to Fletcher, who dinks it back to Nani, who feathers it to Fletcher, who slips in Park, whose shot is deflected just wide. The resulting corner comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>26 min</strong> United are dominating this. \"Fletcher may well may be the most under-appreciated player in Europe if he wasn't playing for Manchester United,\" says Jon Cummins. \"Let Tony Jarvis know, however, that he is without question the worst set-piece marker in Europe, I've seen him burned far too many times for Scotland and United in the last year.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> [Minute-by-minute reporter dons anorak] United shots: six. Villarreal shots: zero.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Nani, who is having one of his better games for United, plays in Evra but his cross is blocked. Villarreal immediately counterattack and Pires' shot from the most acute of angles is easily saved by Van Der Sar.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Tevez gets his foot on the ball, looks up, and then hits a fizzer from 30 yards which is heading for the top corner until Diego Lopez palms round the post.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> More United pressure. This time Rooney's cross is met by Fletcher's head on the penalty spot ... and a Villarreal defender soon afterwards.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>34 min</strong> \"Can I join the 1,056 other pedants in pointing out that if you divide by zero (19 min) you get infinity, which would be a pretty good result for tripping up,\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"I suppose that if you divide by infinity you must get zero, but it's a long time since I did maths and it's too late at night to think that deeply, so it might not be so.\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Yellow card Franco for a two-footed sliding lunge at Evra.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> So close again! Nani's cross evades both Rooney, Ferdinand, Diego Lopez in the Villarreal goal and the back post. United plead for a corner, but the referee - wrongly as it took a deflection - gives a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> More excellent jinkin' and dribblin' from Nani, who makes 10, 15, maybe 20 yards before playing in Park, who takes a touch before appearing to be tripped by Capdevila. He appeals loudly for a penalty but the referee says goal kick. United players are not happy at all.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>40 min</strong> Yet another half-chance for United: this time Tevez drags a shot wide from 15 yards.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>42 min</strong> \"I'd just like to reiterate that the Yucatan on Stokie High St will definitely be showing United in the back room and Arsenal in the front room,\" says Neill Staniforth. \"It's great. On Saturdays you can also watch some Premier League games too via satellite. And in the summer they lay on a free bbq! Awesome.\" Awesome?! This isn't the Sydney Morning Herald, Neill.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Cani Stams it 40 yards over the bar. \"Let's just move the conversation completely away from football and into the classroom for a moment,\" says Andrew Dean, adjusting his thick NHS spectacles. \"No, Robin (34th min) you do not get infinity when dividing by zero, you get a null-set, the calculation can't be made. Zero does not go into any number an infinite amount of times \u2026 that would imply that multiplying infinity by zero would get you some other number(s) instead of the zero that we all know is the result of multiplying a number by zero.\" So now you know.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> For the first time all half. Villarreal actually get their foot on the ball for a good 30 seconds. But they continue to show as much penetration as a wooden knife trying to puncture an armour-plated tank and United clear.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> We're off again. \"Despite a shock result or two last night, these Champions League Group matches are a bit of a waste of time aren't they?\" sighs Gary Naylor. \"Why don't they just look at the wage bills of the teams that qualified and put the top 16 payers into the CL knockout stage and the rest into the Uefa Cup?\" Better still, Gary, why not make the Champions League a 64-team knockout?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> No substitutes at half-time by the way. Meanwhile more arguing about my maths (math for American readers). \"I hope you haven't put any money on anything tonight, because if you think '19,831 divided by zero is nothing' you're likely to come a cropper - 19,831 divided by zero is in fact 19,831,\" insists Neill Staniforth. Are you sure Neill? Really?</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Van Der Sar's 80-yard thump down the pitch just evades Rooney on the left and skids off the turf for a throw in. Villarreal still have nine behind the ball pretty much all of the time, but they're actually been in United's half three times already this half. A statement of intent?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Nani's up-and-under is well taken by Lopez. Meanwhile more maths talk. \"I know I am being pedantic, but division by zero is not defined,\" says Jan Schreuder. \"The limit of the division of a positive number by x while x is getting arbitrarily close to 0 is infinity. Sorry.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> The biggest cheer of the night at Old Trafford comes as Ronaldo begins his warm-up. It's amazing how a poor start to the season can change the attitude of the average United fan, isn't it?</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>55 min</strong> Villarreal are slowly altering their ambitions from all-out-defence to we-might-just-be-able-to-nick-something-here. They're certainly having more possession this half, without actually doing much with it.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Park's meek shot rolls apologetically wide. \"Anyone else notice that United now has a new sponsor?\" chuckles Bobby Otter. \"The US Government! So many jokes, so little time.\" Well, you've got 33 minutes, Bobby ...</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Ronaldo is getting ready to come on ... and the United fans are singing lusty songs in praise of him.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>60 min</strong> Villarreal hit the post! After a superb series of passes, Pires' cross was back-flicked past Van Der Sar by Franco. It hits the post and rolls back into the United keeper's arms.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> United subs: Ronaldo for Park, Anderson for Hargreaves.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>63 min</strong> Meanwhile more dork talk. \"As Andrew Dean comments, multiplying by zeros and infinities is not straightforward,' says Carlos Chiquete from the Applied Mathematics program at the University of Arizona. \"I will add to the confusion and say that infinity is not a number per se, it exists outside of the set of numbers. As such, multiplying by infinity is not allowed. However one can have sequences of numbers that have the respective limits zero and infinity, from which one can calculate a finite result for the limit of the product thereby in a sense get that infinity times zero is 1 or whatever one likes.\" I'm out of my depth here, aren't I?</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Anderson slaloms down the right, chips it to Ronaldo, whose shot hits the ground and loops into Lopez's arms. Moments later, Tevez's cross is pushed out by Lopez a la Arcanada during Spain v Northern Ireland in Espana 82 but Anderson thrashes a 20-yard shot miles over.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>67 min</strong> Villarreal sub: Pires, who has played OK but nothing more, off - Ibagaza on.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>69 min</strong> Another long-range Anderson shot goes well wide. \"When United play Newcastle, it'll be AIG vs Northern Rock,\" points out Gary Naylor. \"Surely the US and UK governments have more pressing commitments than financing the salaries of Joey Barton and Wayne Rooney?\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong> Villarreal are like the kid who is scared to go into the deep end of the swimming pool for years but then get a dangerous taste for it. They're attacking perhaps a bit too much here - and Lopez again has to be smart to fist a Nani cross clear.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> Superb from United! Ronaldo skips down the left, plays in Rooney who slides it across the area where Tevez is lurking. His shot is partly smothered by the keeper allowing Rodriguez to make a brilliant off-the-line clearance.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> Yellow card for Tevez for a nasty barge on Diego. Meanwhile the number of readers suggesting Neill Staniforth (47 min) needs to do remedial/infant school maths: 17.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>76 min</strong> It's all got a bit scrappy, but Villarreal have just had six players in the United half so they definitely think they can get something here.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> Villarreal sub: Franco off, Llorente.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Another United free-kick from halfway inside the Villarreal half; another agricultural defensive clearance from the Spanish side.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> Ronaldo has switched the right-hand side but he's not getting any joy. Meanwhile this from Gary Naylor: \"With AIG being a agency of the US Government, should Sarah Palin find herself a heartbeat from the Presidency, will she threaten war on Zenit St Petersburg in a pre-emptive strike against the possibility of the Russians repeating their Super Cup success in the CL knockout phase. It's time America stopped being pushed around after all!\" Don't joke Gary. It may happen.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> Great chance from Ronaldo - again Nani does well to work an angle, before sending over a backpost cross. Ronaldo is free, about seven yards out, but his header slides wide. He should have done better.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>81 min</strong> United shots on goal: 18. Villarreal shots on goal: four.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>82 min</strong> United sub: Tevez off, Giggs on. Ronaldo then sends a skidding cross which evades everyone, takes a bounce, hits Jonny Evans' head ... and hits the post! So close for United!</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> They've just shown the replay of Evans' chance. He was unmarked, six yards out, just wide of the far post and really should have scored. \"Does Neill Staniforth (47 min) by any chance work in the accounts department at AIG?\" asks Marie Meyer.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> United are really going for it now - can they get a winner? Meanwhile this from Justin Kavanagh. \"Are all these numbers geeks infinitizing on today's MBM the same people who were running, sorry, ruining the world's economies up to the start of this week, perchance?\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Llorente goes for glory from 40 yards, and finds the back of row ZZ.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> United are beginning to resort to page one of the Charles Hughes' book of football here [ie hump it forward as quickly as possible] but it's a tactic that's being easily dealt with by the Villarreal centre-backs.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> Yellow card Ibagaza for - I think - arguing with the referee. Nani goes to ground, appealing for a free-kick, but the referee waves his pleas away.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> We'll have three minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>91 min</strong> Yellow card for Diego Lopez for timewasting. Meanwhile Kevin Mannerings asks: \"Does anyone in Stoke Newington know what happened to Moris Milk Bar, a wonderful kosher Milk Bar where I worked for a week around Easter for a few years making kosher biscuits about 30 years ago? Moris was a wonderful guy to work for, as a young boy he survived<br>Auschwitz.

  "<p><strong>Charles Davis</strong>, economist at the <strong>Centre for Economics and Business Research</strong>, said: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/unemploymentdata.recession\">\"Today's figures</a> show the visceral effect of the credit crunch on the labour market. With the demise of Lehman Brothers, the takeover of Merrill Lynch and continuing problems in the City, we expect unemployment to continue rising well into 2009. </p> <p>\"As the evidence of the slowdown finds its way to dole queues up and down the UK, the case for a Bank of England rate cut before the end of the year becomes ever more telling. However, with inflation still above target, we expect the Monetary Policy Committee to wait until inflation has peaked before cutting interest rates. We expect the first rate cut to occur in November \u2013 and to be followed by a series of cuts through 2009. Today's news is likely to see sterling and the FTSE soften as the UK economic outlook becomes bleaker.\"</p> <p><strong>Nigel Meager</strong>, director of the <strong>Institute for Employment Studies</strong>, said: \"As expected, unemployment continues to grow. The claimant count measure has been increasing since January, and there has been a surge in the last couple of months. What's not yet clear is how big the impact on unemployment will be in the months ahead, as the effects of the latest financial crisis feed through into the real economy. Experience from previous recessions is no guide, because there are new labour market factors in play which may help cushion the unemployment impact this time round: migrant workers, who filled many new jobs in recent years, will stop coming, while those already here have started to return; and fewer people over retirement age will be drawn into work.\"</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> at <strong>Global Insight</strong> said: \"It seems inevitable that extended very weak economic activity and deteriorating business confidence will exact an increasing toll on the labour market over the coming months. Furthermore, employment prospects in the financial sector look increasingly worrying, given the heightened turmoil. Significantly, latest labour hiring surveys are markedly softer, with a September Manpower survey showing that employment intentions are at a nine-year low. In addition, the Bank of England's agents report for September noted that labour demand continued to soften. Consequently, unemployment now looks highly likely to rise above 2 million in 2009.\"</p> <p><strong>David Kern</strong>, economic adviser to the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong>, said: \"Labour market figures highlight the worsening recessionary pressures in the economy. Unemployment is up, employment and vacancies are down.</p> <p>\"With a continued muted increase in average earnings the MPC should find it easier to cut interest rates in October. The UK cannot afford a banking crisis and banks must be supported by adequate liquidity. Authorities in the UK must be as pro-active as those in the US.\"</p> <p><strong>TUC</strong> general secretary <strong>Brendan Barber</strong> said: \"Today's figures show that unemployment is starting to accelerate and it now looks very likely that total unemployment will reach 2 million during 2009. It is more important than ever that we have a co-ordinated economic response to the downturn that puts more money into the pockets of middle and low income families.</p> <p>\"At the same time the Bank of England must play its part. It is clear that deflation is a much more pressing threat than inflation, and interest rates should be cut.\"</p>",
  "<p>This is a wild claim, but I think it's true. If you've got <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/more4/\">More4</a>, and you've never heard of Jon Stewart - I'm about to improve your life.</p> <p>Watch <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/\">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a>. In the UK it's normally on every night, from Monday to Friday, at 8.30pm, after transmission in the US. Trust me. Just watch it. It really is superb.</p> <p>And you should definitely tune in this Friday (or tomorrow, if you live in the US) because Tony Blair is going to be on and it could be a cracker.</p> <p>If you know the programme, you'll probably understand why I'm raving like a lunatic. If you haven't seen it, I expect you're trying to work out why anyone could get so excited about a talk show.</p> <p>But the point about the Daily Show is that it isn't just a comedy programme. It is gloriously funny \u2013 Stewart was praised in a Guardian leader earlier this month which concluded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/08/television.usa\">\"no comedian alive offers quite the same joyful, cathartic dose of satire as does the 45-year-old New Yorker\"</a> - but the real reason why it's become cult viewing is because its analysis is so incisive.</p> <p>The US journalist Thomas Friedman pointed this out last year, in a column in which he tried to imagine how an Iranian spy would report back to Tehran on <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/opinion/05friedman.html\">life in the US</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>We have to note that obtaining open-source intelligence in America has become more difficult, because traditional news shows have become more comedic and more comedic news shows more authoritative.</p> <p>For instance, CNN's nightly business report is hosted by a man named \"Dobbs\". Real journalists come on his show and present transparently propagandistic stories about immigration and trade and then he fulminates about them, much the way our ayatollahs used to do about \"Satanic Americans\" on late-night Iranian TV. So viewers have no real idea what's happening in the US economy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at 11 pm, something called The Daily Show, which appears on Comedy Central, has fake journalists presenting what turns out to be the real news.</p> </blockquote> <p>This helps to explain why the New York Times recently described Stewart as \"the most trusted man in America\". It also explains why guests like Barack Obama, John McCain, and Bill and Hillary Clinton are willing to appear, even at the risk of being mocked. Stewart's even had a head of state on the show, Pervez Musharraf when he was president of Pakistan.</p> <p>Blair has never been on the show before and he's accepted the invitation because it coincides with the start of the faith and globalisation course he's teaching at Yale University. </p> <p>Stewart is never overtly offensive to his guests. But he can expose their weaknesses brilliantly and he's obsessed with what went wrong in \"Mess O'Potamia\". Blair might have some explaining to do. As you can guess, I'll be glued to the screen.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/17/labourleadership.gordonbrown1\">David Cairns</a> is being described as an obscure Scottish politician of whom we know nothing. That may be true in England, but not north of the border, where Cairns is well known and respected as one of the brightest and ablest politicians in the Scottish parliamentary group, and a sound media performer. The departure of the Scotland Office minister has caused blank astonishment among the Scottish political classes precisely because he seemed the ultimate party loyalist. If Cairns can turn against his leader then anyone can. </p> <p>There may be no evil genius orchestrating this rebellion \u2013 except perhaps the leak machine in Number 10 \u2013 but the \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7616243.stm\">revolt of the clones</a>\" seems pretty effective nevertheless. First \"Blair's babes\" burned their pagers and demanded a leadership election. Then the Lancashire mafia, led by George Howarth MP, stuck in their knives, along with left-wingers like the former minister, Peter Kilfoyle. Now the Scots \u2013 supposedly the last bastion of Brownism \u2013 have broken ranks. This is a multicultural, cross-gender, north-south, left-right rebellion led by people who never normally rebel. That's what makes it so damaging. </p> <p>Cairns is well equipped to deliver the message that something must be done. He had the misfortune to be Labour's official spokesman for the Glasgow East <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7522153.stm\">byelection</a>, when Labour lost its third safest seat in Scotland on a 22% swing to the Scottish National party. It was a salutary experience discovering that, in the very citadel of Scottish Labourism, in the constituency of John Wheatley, Labour's core vote was disintegrating. Cairns genuinely believes that doing nothing, while Labour is 20 points behind the \"vacuous Tories\" as he describes them, is morally indefensible. </p> <p>Nor can Labour afford to hand Scotland over to the SNP which is effectively what is happening. Nowhere is Brown more of an electoral liability than in his homeland. This may sound surprising given Scotland's propensity to get behind its favourite sons. But there is widespread disillusion, verging on a sense of betrayal, among Labour's Scottish tribe over their leader's performance. He's become a national embarrassment. </p> <p>The Scots wanted a clean break from Blairite \"modernisation\"; they got Blairism with an unacceptable face. They hoped for someone who understood Labour's roots and would return to recognisably social democratic policies. What they did not expect what the scrapping of the 10p tax band and bungs to the wealthy like the abolition of inheritance tax on \u00a3600,000 estates. The proposal for tackling the energy crisis by loft insulation has gone down particularly badly in a cold country where a lot of working people still live in tenements and don't have lofts to insulate. </p> <p>Cairns was a Catholic priest before he entered politics and represents a Christian socialist tradition which is still very much alive in west-central Scotland. He was a researcher to the rebel MP, Siobhain McDonagh, who was sacked last week for calling for nomination papers to be distributed to MP to precipitate a leadership election. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7619553.stm\">Cairns says</a> it was the abrupt dismissal of the matter by Labour's national executive committee that finally forced him out.</p> <p>With its chilling bureaucratic prose it certainly sounded like a decree from the desk of the Dear Leader. A statement released by the NEC chair Dianne Hayter said. \"The Labour party national executive committee is in agreement that internal procedural debates will not divert the Labour party from our mission of building a fairer Britain and helping people through these challenging times\".</p> <p>Well, increasingly, Labour MPs see Brown as the great diversion. Cairns is being denounced throughout the party organisation as a \"traitor\". But he is also a realist. There is no way out for Gordon Brown. If ministers like Cairns have been prepared to sacrifice their careers, then it is surely time for someone in cabinet to have the cojones to do likewise. David Miliband must realise that if he doesn't act now, he will lose the moment and end up as a footnote to history.</p> <p>Cairns is convinced that Number 10 has been \"outing\" disaffected party insiders, like himself, as a means of marginalising them. If so, it has been counterproductive, creating instead a rolling rebellion. It is a mirror image of the turbulence that preceded the 2006 Labour conference, and ultimately led to Tony Blair having to set a date for his departure. We're not there yet, but pretty soon critical mass will be reached, and the clamour for change will become so widespread it cannot be ignored.</p>",
  "<p>Voting began today to find a new leader for Israel's ruling Kadima party, with the current foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, still ahead in opinion polls.</p> <p>Around 74,000 members of Kadima will take part in the vote with a result not expected until early tomorrow. If the winner succeeds in forming a coalition with other smaller parties within the next five weeks, he or she will become prime minister. Four candidates are running and Livni's strongest challenger is Shaul Mofaz, a hawkish former army chief, who has emphasised his security background.</p> <p>Opinion polls have consistently put Livni, a former lawyer who entered politics a decade ago, a long way in front, although analysts caution that Israeli primary elections are difficult to call particularly since this is the first primary for Kadima, a party formed only three years ago by the then prime minister, Ariel Sharon. If Livni wins and forms a coalition she would be the first female prime minister of Israel in more than 30 years.</p> <p>The latest poll, carried out on Monday for the Ma'ariv newspaper, suggested the gap between the two leading contenders was shrinking but still put Livni well ahead on 42.5%, against Mofaz on 30.4%. The two other candidates, Avi Dichter, the internal security minister, and Meir Sheetrit, the tourism minister, are a long way behind.</p> <p>\"Today we can start to make the change that Israel needs in order to once again be what it should be, what it can be,\" Livni told Israeli Army Radio this morning. \"I know what this country needs ... to continue the process that will allow us to determine the borders of the state of Israel with security.\"</p> <p>Mofaz told the radio station: \"The state of Israel stands before major challenges in the coming years and needs a strong leader who has the courage to decide and the ability to act.\"</p> <p>Although both are from the same party, there are wide differences in their positions. Livni, 50, has been closely involved in the past year of negotiations with the Palestinians and is expected to continue the process if she wins. She argues in favour of a Palestinian state although she is adamantly opposed to the return of even a single Palestinian refugee into what is now Israel. </p> <p>Mofaz, 59, has been much more sceptical about the idea of talks with the Palestinians and is thought unlikely to continue them. He has taken a tough line on Iran and its nuclear ambitions, saying earlier this year that he thought war with Iran was \"unavoidable\".</p> <p>Some Israeli commentators have been unimpressed by either. Sima Kadmon, writing in today's Yedioth Ahronoth, said they lacked charisma and leadership ability. \"It is not an easy choice. Choosing between Tzipi Livni and Shaul Mofaz is like choosing between two shades of grey,\" Kadmon wrote.</p> <p>Today's election has been prompted by a series of embarrassing and high-profile corruption investigations into the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, who is halfway through his four-year term. Police have recommended he be charged, although he may not be indicted for several months. Olmert has promised to resign after today's vote but is likely to stay on as a caretaker prime minister while a coalition is formed.</p> <p>If today's winner gets more than 40% of the vote, he or she will be asked to form a coalition within the next 42 days, which would require drawing in the small and fractious parties necessary to form a government. If this fails, elections must be held within three months. Polls suggest that Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the rightwing Likud party, is best placed to win if a general election were held now.</p>",
  "<p>Mexico's chamber of deputies is discussing a federal law to combat murderous attacks on journalists. Part of the debate centres on the definition of a journalist. The justice ministry initially favoured a restrictive definition that would exclude people such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Cacho\"><strong>Lydia Cacho</strong></a>, who is famous for her reporting on paedophile rings, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Will\"><strong>Brad Will</strong></a>, a cameraman murdered in October 2006.
