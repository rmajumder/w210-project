  "<p>In 1966 my father, Kenneth Leigh, died suddenly - an immense trauma for my mother, Mary Leigh, and our family. But Mary, who has died aged 86, was going to succeed, despite adversity, and trained at Chorley College of Education for mature students in Lancashire.</p> <p>From 1969 to 1986, she taught with the reception class at Our Lady's school in Blackpool. She excelled with the ITA (initial teaching alphabet) method of reading - from a class of 40 pupils everyone left reading confidently. She was also very proud of the 30 junior pupils she trained as Morris dancers for charity parades on the promenade.</p> <p>Mary Clarke was born into a warm, loving Catholic family in Swinton and Pendlebury, Manchester. Her father was the local police constable, and one of her delights was to visit the home of LS Lowry at weekends with him. Lowry gave her pocket money and a little sketch, which her mother binned! </p> <p>After leaving the Adelphi House grammar school, run by the Faithful Companions of Jesus, she worked for the Transport and General Workers Union in Salford, organising sick pay benefits for Lancashire and Yorkshire. She married our father in 1946 and they moved to Nelson before settling in Blackpool. </p> <p>In her retirement Mary enjoyed tatting (handcrafting lace) and embroidery. At the age of 80, she was still able to walk to Fleetwood, a good 10 miles. Following the effects of strokes, she fought vascular dementia and from 2005, had 24-hour, dedicated care at her home, supported by the Blackpool community mental health teams - providing a crucial lesson that care at home is possible. Even in her final weeks, she would sit up in bed to eat an ice cream cornet with a wink in her eye and a beaming smile. She leaves four children, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain are to focus over the next 48 hours on Florida, the state that proved pivotal in the last two elections, as both teams stuck to their campaign timetables in spite of the havoc on Wall Street.</p> <p>Obama highlighted the importance of the state when he appealed to supporters for $39m (\u00a321.4m) - about half of the total $84m that is available to McCain for the entire campaign - to spend on advertising and other events in Florida alone.</p> <p>The Democratic candidate, who is to speak at rallies in Coral Gables today and Jacksonville tomorrow, is running neck and neck with McCain in the state. President George Bush won Florida, the fourth most important state in terms of electoral votes, by 380,000 votes in 2004.</p> <p>David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, in an email to supporters asking for cash, said 500,000 black voters and 900,000 young people, both overwhelmingly behind Obama, have been registered who did not vote in 2004. </p> <p>The key could be the Hispanic vote, with signs that a sizable proportion could swing behind Obama.</p> <p>The other big demographic group in the state is the Jewish community, which normally votes Democrat. Ira Forman, executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, complained yesterday that the Republican Jewish Coalition was targeting Jewish voters with \"lie-filled polling\" and ads \"that are filled with innuendoes and half-truths\". </p> <p>The Democrats have repeatedly complained that groups, often found to have links to the Republican party, have been involved in what is known as \"push-polling\" - pretending to conduct polls but inserting misleading information about Obama into the questions.</p> <p>The Republican party is to air an advertisement today aimed at Florida's Hispanic population. The Spanish ad highlights how McCain, who is more liberal on immigration than his party, fought for immigration reform in the Senate last year. </p> <p>As polls showed Obama benefiting more from the Wall Street meltdown than McCain, the Republican candidate went on the offensive, claiming that an Obama presidency would mean increased federal spending and increased taxes.</p>",
  "<p>When Tony Jarratt (or JRat, as he was known), who has died of lung cancer aged 58, started caving on the Mendip hills in Somerset more than 40 years ago, speleology acquired a true original.</p> <p>Caves need patient, prolonged and determined excavation. Nothing deterred Tony, and his enthusiasm was contagious. Over the years, his contribution to the discovery of the cave systems beneath the Mendips - and the mountains of Sutherland in the Scottish Highlands - was immeasurable. He spent more than 11,000 hours underground and took part in 500 trips, exploring caves in South Africa, Mexico, the US, south-east Asia, Australia, Europe and most recently the longest systems in the Indian state of Meghalaya.</p> <p>Tony moved with his family from Dudley, in the West Midlands, to the Bristol area in his early teens, and started caving while at school. He worked for the Ordnance Survey before taking over the only caving equipment shop in the south-west, Bat Products in Wells, from a fellow member of the Bristol Exploration Club. In 1977 (with Dave Irwin), he wrote the Mendip cavers' bible, Mendip Underground, now in its fourth edition. </p> <p>Tony lived only a few hundred yards from the village green in Priddy, Somerset, which lies over Swildon's Hole, the longest cave in the Mendips. During the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic, when his plans to go exploring on farmland were thwarted, Roger Dors, landlord of the Hunter's Lodge Inn, near Priddy, offered him the chance to dig a small hole at the soakaway in the car park which took drainage from the pub and nearby road in heavy rain. The dig was a considerable source of amusement to the caving fraternity, until Tony broke through into an ancient fossil cave passage containing a magnificent array of stalactites, now known as the Hunter's Lodge Inn Sink. He continued digging with a team of enthusiasts and was rewarded by the extraordinary find of Pleistocene bone deposits, including the remains of reindeer dating back to the last ice age. </p> <p>Shortly before his death, he was a leading member of the team that excavated a dry way into the Claonaite cave system in Assynt in Sutherland, allowing a Scottish museum team to remove the bones of a bear from a passage which had previously only been accessible to cave divers, and in the process discovering one of the largest cave chambers in Scotland.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain is to take his running mate Sarah Palin to the UN general assembly in New York next week for the annual gathering of foreign leaders, to address her chronic shortage of foreign policy experience.</p> <p>McCain is scheduled to open an international conference in the city at the same time - Bill Clinton's Global Initiative foundation, which provides funds to help fight Aids in developing countries.</p> <p>Palin's fast-learning trip to New York comes as a veteran Republican senator, Chuck Hagel, who is on the Senate foreign affairs committee, yesterday questioned her fitness for office. \"She doesn't have any foreign policy credentials,\" Hagel told the Omaha World-Herald. \"You get a passport for the first time in your life last year? I mean, I don't know what you can say. You can't say anything.\"</p> <p>Hagel, who advocates a bipartisan approach to politics and was among those considered by Obama as a running mate, said: \"I think it's a stretch to in any way say that she's got the experience to be president of the United States.\"</p> <p>McCain's team has not yet said who Palin will meet in New York. Leaders pencilled in for her UN visit range from President George Bush to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, and the Afghanistan president, Hamid Karzai. The cast list for the Clinton foundation conference includes Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Exposure to foreign leaders can only help Palin, who has had to be briefed extensively by McCain's foreign policy advisers since becoming the vice-presidential candidate. Her foreign travel is confined to Canada, Mexico and Kuwait, and a brief stop at an airport in Ireland.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I've Never Seen Star Wars</strong> (Radio 4) is a great idea: getting people to try out new things on air. As presenter Marcus Brigstocke explained, this might be because you haven't wanted to do something before (\"get a tattoo, eat in a Harvester restaurant\") or have been too scared (\"to go through US customs and immigration with a beard\"). </p> <p>It is very funny indeed. Last night, Phill Jupitus tried a Findus Crispy Pancake (\"one of the words isn't true,\" he quipped), foie gras, and pigs' trotters. The latter wasn't much of a revelation (\"as you might expect, Marcus, they taste of pork\"), but an impromptu combination of pancake and foie gras proved more exciting. \"It's like class war in my mouth,\" he said.</p> <p>He also tried colonic irrigation, and the recording of that was one of the funniest bits of radio this year. The therapist explained the process in a deadpan manner that was quite majestic, especially when she let her \"tubing clamps\" make their worrying sound effect. Jupitus fretted that she'd find \"some hidden G-spot of delight\" and that he'd become \"sexually addicted to having my arse pumped out\". Rather worryingly, then, he has already booked his next appointment. </p>",
  "<h2>Call for emergency reform of food aid programmes</h2> <p>The number of people without food is increasing despite rich countries spending billions of pounds a year on emergency feeding programmes, one of the world's largest humanitarian groups has reported. Care International calls for a radical reform of the UN's international food aid system. By 2015 nearly \u00a3100bn will have been spent on emergencies since world leaders pledged to halve world hunger in 1999. The current system of countries waiting to act until food shortages become crises risks increasing malnutrition. \"Donors are failing to fund preventative action adequately,\" the report says. <br><strong>John Vidal </strong></p> <h2>Second riot at Tijuana prison leaves 19 dead</h2> <p>A second riot in three days at an infamous Tijuana prison has left 19 people dead and 12 injured, officials say. Baja California's public safety secretary, Daniel de la Rosa, said soldiers and federal police regained control of the overcrowded La Mesa prison, just across the US border from San Diego, on Wednesday. He added that authorities were transferring 200 inmates to other state prisons and were increasing security. Family members say the inmates rioted again because they have not been given food or water since Sunday, when a separate riot led to the deaths of at least three inmates. <br><strong>Associated Press in Tijuana</strong></p> <h2>US soldier jailed over killings of four Iraqis</h2> <p>A US soldier was sentenced to seven months in prison yesterday after pleading guilty to conspiracy to murder in the killing of four Iraqi prisoners who were bound, blindfolded, shot and dumped in a Baghdad canal last year. The relatively lenient sentence for Specialist Belmor Ramos was part of a deal in which he will testify against others alleged to have been involved in the killings. Prosecutors said the killings were in retribution for casualties in Ramos's unit. Ramos, 23, of Clearfield, Utah, told a judge at his court martial in Germany that he stood guard as the men were killed. <br><strong>Associated Press in Vilseck</strong></p> <h2>Dairy recall after territory finds banned chemical</h2> <p>Hong Kong has recalled a Chinese dairy's products after tests discovered the same chemical found in tainted baby milk that killed and sickened thousands in China. The government found the banned industrial chemical melamine in eight of 30 samples from Yili Industrial Group, said the territory's food safety centre, including milk powder that has killed up to four babies and sickened 6,200 others in mainland China. Following the announcement, Yili said in a statement it was recalling all milk, yogurt, ice cream and ice cream bars in Hong Kong because of the \"melamine incident\". <br><strong>Associated Press in Hong Kong</strong></p> <h2>Lorca family to accept ruling on opening grave</h2> <p>Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca's family will not oppose a petition to open a mass grave where his body is believed to have been dumped after Franco supporters allegedly shot the poet at the outbreak of Spain's civil war in 1936, a relative said yesterday. Families of other victims have asked a judge to rule on opening the grave, in southern Spain. The family of the poet, who was 38 when he died, had always opposed a search. Laura Garc\u00eda Lorca, the poet's niece, said the family would prefer to leave the grave untouched but \"will accept whatever decision is taken without objection\". <br><strong>Associated Press in Madrid</strong></p>",
  "<p>The US is seeking $20bn from its allies to help stabilise Afghanistan as it plans to send thousands more of its own troops to confront the growing insurgency in the country, American officials disclosed yesterday.</p> <p>Robert Gates, the American defence secretary, said the US was considering a fundamental review of its strategy. But his message was clear - the US expected countries which did not contribute troops to Afghanistan to contribute money instead.</p> <p>\"Lessons had been learned from Iraq ...that means more forces,\" Gates told journalists in London.</p> <p>General David McKiernan, the US commander in Afghanistan, has asked the Pentagon for three more American brigades in addition to the extra one already announced by President Bush and due to be deployed in January.</p> <p>This would increase the number of US troops in Afghanistan, at present numbering 30,000, to nearly 44,000.</p> <p>It remains unclear, however, whether Britain will increase its military presence in the country after the bulk of the 4,000-strong garrison now stationed at Basra airport leaves Iraq, as expected, in the first half of next year.</p> <p>There are now about 7,800 British troops in Afghanistan. Gates, in London for a meeting of Nato defence ministers, said that \"the UK may increase the size of its force [in Afghanistan]\". </p> <p>However, the Ministry of Defence was quick to deny there were any new plans to increase the number of British troops there. An MoD spokesman said: \"Force levels are kept under continual review and an uplift of approximately 230 personnel was announced ... on June 16.\" </p> <p>The British government's priority is to get better and more equipment, notably helicopters and armoured vehicles for its troops in Afghanistan, defence officials say.</p> <p>Gates said he expected \"substantial commitments\" from other allies for other purposes. \"One of the issues I will be raising at the [Nato] meeting is that we need as an alliance and with our partners to figure out a way to help pay for [doubling] the size of the Afghan army,\" he said. \"The capability of the Afghan army ultimately is the exit strategy.\"</p> <p>A US official said yesterday that the plan was to double the size of the Afghan army from the present 65,000 in five years. That would cost an estimated $20bn. \"We can see what those countries which are not contributing troops can contribute financially,\" he said. </p> <p>That plan, which could include countries outside Nato, such as Japan, \"makes sense\", he said.</p> <p>Admiral Michael Mullen told the US congress last week he was \"not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan\". </p> <p>Gates yesterday distanced himself from the comment, referring instead to \"increasing challenges\" and a more complex conflict. It was not just a fight between foreign forces and the Taliban, he said. He referred to \"a kind of syndicate working together\" consisting of the Taliban, foreign fighters, and supporters of Gulbertin Hekmatiyar, an Islamist militia leader. </p> <p>\"Syndicates of different players [present] a different kind of challenge,\" Gates said. He added: \"Clearly a piece of the problem is governance and corruption fuelled by the narcotics trade.\"</p> <p>In common with Des Browne, the British defence secretary, Gates said Afghanistan would remain a \"long-term\" problem.</p> <p>He addressed two other sensitive and difficult issues - relations with Pakistan and the number of civilian deaths caused by US bombing raids in Afghanistan.</p> <p>He said US military chiefs, including Mullen, were in close contact with the new Pakistani leadership leaders. The \"most productive path\" in dealing with al-Qaida, Taliban and other insurgents based in Pakistan's north-west tribal areas was \"in cooperation with Pakistan\", Gates said. However, he did not comment on the role of US special forces - which do not come under the command of US generals in Afghanistan - in cross-border raids. </p> <p>Gates disclosed he had issued new orders to US commanders in Afghanistan, instructing them to consider carefully the risks of civilian casualties. He added that the US had been \"on the wrong side of strategic communications\" - in future the US would apologise and compensate families first - and investigate afterwards.</p> <p>\"The issue of civilian casualties is very important to us. We try to make sure they do not occur and we work cooperatively with the Afghans and others like the UN should incidents occur.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Richard Boucher, the US assistant secretary of state for South Asia, was in London consulting British Foreign Office officials about developments in Afghanistan and Pakistan in advance of next week's UN general assembly session, which Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai will be attending. </p> <p>Boucher told the Guardian. \"The loss of life is a tragedy but it also has a political impact. </p> <p>\"It's very hard because we are dealing with an enemy that intentionally goes out and blows up civilians in markets and on buses, that hides in villages and farmhouses to shoot at us, though we recognise we have to be extra careful.\" </p> <p>McKiernan has warned that the chronic shortage of US troops is forcing commanders to rely more on airstrikes, that can kill innocent civilians. The US admits that the Taliban have become more organised and are working more closely with al-Qaida.</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Call for $20bn to be contributed by allies so as to double size of Afghan army in five years to 122,000 troops</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> US army to send three more brigades, raising its total to 50,000 soldiers</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cooperate with Pakistan over insurgents in frontier areas</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Directive to US commanders to avoid civilian casualties and accept responsibility when they occur</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 22 2008.

  "<p>What ho the revolution! Do you hear the people sing? Singing a song of angry men! It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again! Dum de dum de dum de dum!</p> <p>As we watch the world economy, our pension plans and thousands of bankers plummet past our windows, the question is, how will this revolution manifest itself? There seems little need to storm the gates of the Dickensian-sounding Goldman Sachs, seeing as those portals may soon be trampled by fleeing employees, cardboard boxes aloft. Back in days of yore, of course, the answer was to overthrow the ruling royal family. God, doesn't that look like an oxymoron now? Do the royals do anything these days other than attend things called \"roller discos\" and, in the case of wee Andrew, hang out with shady oil barons?</p> <p>Lost in Showbiz was lucky enough to attend London fashion week and most illuminating it was, because it truly brought to light who this country's dynasties are: the children of famous relics of the 60s and 80s. Truly, there ain't nothing like turning up to a fashion show early Monday morning and being greeted by the sight of a hot-panted Jaime Winstone posing for a panting battalion of photographers, back curved, bum aloft, Jayne Mansfield's sobs audible on the wind, to make one come over a little Daniel Cohn-Bendit.</p> <p>When Samantha Cameron turned up to one show, she was completely ignored by the gleeful photographers with direct lines to the photo desks of the Daily Mail in favour of the heart-stopping appearance of not one but two Jagger children and - sweet Lord, you are good to your humble lambs - Leah Woods, current face of something called \"BlackBerry Smartphone Celebrity Urban Tours\". This raises a quandary for a Guardian reader: does one applaud the ignominious lack of interest in an evil Tory-type person? Or is this adoration of unemployed progeny a sign of our dumbed-down society? Rock? Hard place?</p> <p>The hunting-happy Ferry boys, rent-a-blonde Kimberly Stewart, the Geldof girls: I'm sure that once rock star kids had to do something to grab our interest. Now they just have to be born. True, very few of us want to hear Peaches Geldof do a Julian Lennon-style Saltwater (although I would love a Jagger/Woods version of Wilson Phillips), but, still, it's hard not to worry just how these people would have filled their lives were it not for the existence of the London Evening Standard magazine, ES.</p> <p>Wait, I'm being unfair. Let's not forget hardworking Jade Jagger, who recently designed a $250,000 ice pick called the \"Jagger Dagger\" for a vodka company. Thank heavens that hole has been filled. Oh, and Peaches - who scurried back to London this week from New York after having been bafflingly ignored by the American press - is in a \"DJ collective\" called the Trash Pussies. And that's all the employment info I can find on any of the mock royalty at the moment.</p> <p>Although I wouldn't go so far as to advocate beheading (except in certain, carefully unspecified cases) perhaps exiling them to a country that doesn't have such a freaky fascination with bloodlines would do the trick. All those with the middle name \"daughter/son of\", against the wall you go.</p>",
  "<p>Any philosopher will tell you that revenge isn't sweet - it's ruinous. But how often do the wounded, jealous, downtrodden or plain infuriated find succour in philosophy, rather than in dreams and acts of vengeance? Writers are in a better position to retaliate against slings and arrows than the rest of us, by attacking their enemies in prose or song: it's bloodless, and earns cash to boot. In a study of revenge tragedy, the critic John Kerrigan even declared, \"Vengeance is at the root of what many people now think they are doing when they write, or sing, or just strive for 'achievement'.\"</p> <p>There has already been a playlist dedicated to hatchet jobs, songs that are themselves acts of revenge. This week's list is inspired more by Jacobean drama, those maniacal bloodfests in which injured characters brood, plot and finally throttle the law with their bare hands. Kate Bush, no stranger to theatricality, sets the stage thrillingly, depicting a woman who marries the man who killed her lover, so she can slaughter him on their wedding night.</p> <p>Buenas Tardes Amigo may be an absurd mariachi pastiche, but its tale of a son revenging his brother's murder is gripping - especially when he reveals his real motive. The Triffids never tell us what prompted their protagonist's killing spree, but as flames consume his home town, they make mass murder sound unnervingly romantic.</p> <p>Ice-T expounds a seemingly straightforward \"eye for an eye\" manifesto, but underlying his declaration of revenge's necessity is an understanding of its dangerous cyclical nature. If only more people would follow the lead of Waylon Jennings, who revels in nothing more than a \"sweet mental revenge\", imagining the downfall of his ex-love and the ex-friend who stole her away. Or, perhaps, the abused wife in Maddy Prior's elegant version of Stitch in Time: she merely beats her drunken husband with a frying pan, making him a better man in the process.</p> <p>Thankfully, few singers go to the extremes of the blues artist Pat Hare, who, having recorded this slithery threat to do away with his no-good woman, went ahead and did just that. In 1962, he killed his girlfriend, as well as the policeman sent to investigate, earning himself 16 years in prison. In case that doesn't convince you that revenge doesn't pay, here come the Beatles with the cautionary tale of Rocky Raccoon: he pulls a gun on his rival in love, only to be shot himself. Then there is the experience of the teenager in Nightmare, doomed to be haunted for ever by the screams of the girl she accidentally kills in a fight. The song is as electrifying and outrageous as 1960s girl-group melodrama gets.</p> <p>There is only one conclusion to draw from all this. The best revenge anyone can have is to rise above their adversary. That's what Beyonc\u00e9 does, stylishly, commandingly, witheringly, on Survivor. Vengeance as achievement, it seems, really does taste sweet.</p> <h2>This week's playlist </h2> <p><strong>1. The Wedding List </strong>Kate Bush <br><strong>2.

(The relevant bit starts at around 2m58s.) Josh Marshall, who's <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/217802.php\">pushing this story hardest</a>, seems to think that's possible McCain is that confused. At the very least, McCain's odd insistence on answering a question about whether he'd invite Zapatero to visit the White House by talking only about Mexico suggests he might have thought the topic under discussion was Mexico's Zapatista movement. McCain's foreign policy advisor Randy Scheunemann, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/18/mccain_slights_spanish_prime_m.html\">claims</a> McCain's refusal to confirm that he'd meet with Zapatero was deliberate. (It's true that there's no love lost between Zapatero and the Bush administration, but McCain has said he'll patch up relationships of this sort, damaged by Iraq.)</p> <p>So, to clarify matters for McCain: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero\">Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero</a> is the lefty prime minister of Spain. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapatista_Army_of_National_Liberation\">The Zapatistas</a> are armed revolutionaries who have declared war on the government of Mexico. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zippy_(Rainbow)\">Zippy</a> is an irascible non-human character in the children's TV series Rainbow, and <a href=\"http://epguides.com/CaptainZep/\">Captain Zep</a> was the star of an awesome 1980s British children's sci-fi drama. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Zeffirelli\">Franco Zeffirelli</a> is a celebrated Italian film director who I once pretended to know the first thing about in order not to look stupid in a conversation in a restaurant.</p> <p>By the way, this must be a truly depressing day for our friends at <a href=\"http://spain4mccain.wordpress.com/\">Spain For McCain</a>. We can assume they're not Zapatero fans, but still: their hero isn't even sure where their country is located? How dispiriting.</p> <p>UPDATE: I'm taken to task in comments for calling Zapatero the prime minister (his official Spanish title translates as \"president\", but everyone calls him \"prime minister\" in English because he's the head of a parliamentary system), for calling the Zapatistas \"armed revolutionaries\" (yes, there's much more to the situation than that), and far more crucially for leaving <a href=\"http://www.zappa.com/\">Frank Zappa</a> off the list, which was inexcusable.<br></p>",
  "<p>Yesterday's publication of the annual <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/18/islam.religion\">Pew survey</a> of global attitudes has found that both Islamophobia and antisemitism are on the rise in Europe.<br> Hostile attitudes towards Jews have increased in all European countries, except for one: Great Britain. The <a href=\"http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/262.pdf\">report (pdf)</a> said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Great Britain stands out as the only European country included in the survey where there has not been a substantial increase in antisemitic attitudes.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for attitudes towards Muslims, well:</p> <blockquote> <p>Opinions about Muslims in almost all of these countries are considerably more negative than are views of Jews.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report does not look into why this could be. Is it all to do with the threat of terrorist attacks? I am not so sure. That would not explain, for example, why there is increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Europe \u2013 we are not facing terror attacks by Jewish extremists. <br> I have written several pieces for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/18/amaliciouscampaign\">Cif</a> where I have given examples of what I believe are regular and quite deliberate attempts on the part of some of our national newspapers to incite anti-Muslim prejudice.<br> Just last month, I wrote about how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/31/religion.race\">Douglas Murray</a>, director of the Centre for Social Cohesion and a regular interviewee on BBC TV and radio had in a 2006 speech entitled \"What are we to do with Islam?\" demanded that:</p> <blockquote> <p>All immigration into Europe from Muslim countries must stop \u2026 Conditions for Muslims in Europe must be made harder across the board: Europe must look like a less attractive proposition.</p> </blockquote> <p>This campaign to vilify Muslims has not gone unnoticed by the British National party, whose leader, Nick Griffin, has openly argued that:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>We should be positioning ourselves to take advantage for our own political ends of the growing wave of public hostility to Islam currently being whipped up by the mass media.</p> </blockquote> <p>On a slightly more hopeful note, the Pew report does the make the following two observations:</p> <blockquote> <p>Older people and those with less education are more antisemitic and anti-Muslim than are younger people or those with more education \u2026 Anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish opinions are most prevalent among Europeans on the political right.</p> </blockquote> <p>As a society it is noticeable we have all moved quite some way in recent years towards regarding prejudice and discrimination based on gender, race or sexual orientation as being unacceptable. The challenge now \u2013 for all of us, including British Muslims and Jews \u2013 must be to treat religious prejudice and discrimination as being equally abhorrent. </p> <p><em>Rabbi Jonathan Romain's blog on the Pew survey will be published on Cif tomorrow</em></p>",
  "<p>George Bush today defended the US central bank's decision to bail out giant insurer AIG and sought to reassure markets that his administration was intent on confronting the growing crisis.</p> <p>The crisis also shaped the day's talk on the campaign trail, with both candidates seeking to grab the economic situation for their advantage. The economic troubles have shifted the tone of the presidential race, with Barack Obama enjoying a slight resurgence in polling as voters deem him better equipped to manage the ailing economy than Republican John McCain.</p> <p>Under pressure to respond forcefully to the grim economic news, McCain said today that if he were in power he would the nation's top securities regulator and a former Republican congressman, Christopher Cox.</p> <p>\"The chairman of the [Securities and Exchange Commission] serves at the appointment of the president and, in my view, has betrayed the public's trust,\" McCain told supporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \"If I were president today, I would fire him.\"</p> <p>Obama, campaigning in Espanola, New Mexico, mocked McCain's threat.</p> <p>\"I think that's all fine and good but here's what I think,\" Obama said. \"In the next 47 days you can fire the whole trickle-down, on-your-own, look-the-other way crowd in Washington who has led us down this disastrous path. Don't just get rid of one guy. Get rid of this administration. Get rid of this philosophy. Get rid of the do-nothing approach to our economic problem and put somebody in there who's going to fight for you.\"</p> <p>Cox, a Bush appointee, attributed McCain's comments to the heat of the campaign. He said the financial crisis was \"presenting new challenges on an hourly basis\" and that \"steadiness and reduction of uncertainty\" is what the US and the world needed.</p> <p>\"History will judge the quality of our response to this economic crisis, but now is not the time for those of us in the trenches to be distracted by the ebb and flow of the current election campaign,\" Cox said in a statement. \"And it is precisely the wrong moment for a change in leadership.\"</p> <p>As stocks in New York rallied in early trading, partly in response to a coordinated series of moves by central banks around the world to pump money into credit markets, Bush said AIG's failure \"could have caused a severe disruption in our financial markets and threatened other sectors of our economy\".</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve seized control of AIG with an $85bn emergency loan in exchange for 80% of the company's stock.</p> <p>Overnight, the US central bank, known as the Fed, joined central banks across the world in coordinated efforts to maintain liquidity in world credit markets, together making almost $200bn available to lenders.</p> <p>\"The markets are adjusting to them,\" Bush said at the White House. \"Our financial markets continue deal with serious challenges. As our recent actions demonstrate, my administration is focused on meeting these challenges. The American people can be assured we will continue to act to strengthen and stabilise our financial markets and to reassure investor confidence.\"</p> <p>Bush said he spoke this morning with the US treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, and said the two will meet later today. The president, who had not addressed the nation since Monday, said he had cancelled travel plans in order to monitor the markets and consult with advisers. He was to head to Alabama and Florida to raise money for the Republican party and talk energy policy.</p> <p>The AIG rescue was the fourth taxpayer-funded bailout of the year by the Bush administration, although it is at odds with Bush's free-market ideology and economic policies. Critics of the recent bailouts have said taxpayers should not foot the bill for investors' bad business decisions, and have wondered aloud why AIG and government sponsored mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac won massive government rescues while investment bank Lehman Brothers was allowed to crumble on Sunday.</p>",
  "<p>Arctic sea ice has reached the second lowest extent ever recorded, according to the US national snow and ice centre, and a new map shows how far the 2008 melt has receded compared to the historical average. </p> <p>The map, produced by Collins, illustrates that the area of ice that is at least five years old has fallen by more than half since 1985. It comes as the Northwest Passage, above north America, and the Northeast Passage, over the top of Russia, are both free of ice for the first time. </p> <p>\"While slightly above the record-low minimum set last year, this season further reinforces the strong negative trend in summer sea ice extent observed during the past 30 years. Before last year, the previous record low for September was set in 2005\", said a spokesman for the Snow and Ice center based at the University of Colorado.</p> <p>A spokesman for WWF International said: \"This means two years in a row of record lows. The trend of melting Arctic sea ice is alarming for the rest of the world. The Arctic is a key factor in stabilising the global climate so this is a global problem that demands an immediate and global response.\"</p> <p>The daily rate of ice loss usually starts to slow in August as the Arctic begins to cool. But in August 2008, the daily decline rate remained steadily downward and strong. </p> <p>The average daily ice loss rate for August 2008 was 78,000 square kilometers (30,000 square miles) per day. This was the fastest rate of daily ice loss that scientists had observed since satellite photographs were started in 1979.</p>",

  "<p>The history of sport as we know it, says US sports writer Dave Zirin, \"is a bosses' history based on bluster and lies\u2026 And most sports writing is unbearable, painting every athlete like the love child of John Wayne and Sarah Palin.\" </p> <p>Relax. Sit down. Take the weight off your feet. I've got all your lefty/liberal/pinko sport fan Christmas present needs sorted. Dave Zirin's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Peoples-History-Sports-United-States/dp/1595581006/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1218899209&amp;sr=8-2\">A People's History of Sports in the United States of America</a> has Muhammad Ali's fist on the cover. And as you'd expect from Zirin (US sports writing's top commie agitator) the chapter featuring Ali zips all over the place trying to tell the amazing tale of American sport in a decade of massive social upheaval \u2013 and it stings like a billion bees. </p> <p>The American consensus is terribly effective at taking loudmouths, troublemakers and revolutionaries \u2013 men and women derided as dangerous and even insane by their contemporaries \u2013 and repackaging them as cuddly All-American Care Bears. Just look at what it's done to Martin Luther King. \"It's sort of political root canal work,\" says Zirin, \"where the dangerous canines are sanded off. The other thing historians and writers do is bury athletes so they enter the vast realm of the forgotten. If the book teaches a few sports fans the names <a href=\"http://www.nlbpa.com/walker__moses_fleetwood.html\">Moses Fleetwood Walker</a> or <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DB143EF93BA35751C0A9669C8B63\">Jack Scott</a>, I will be very happy.\" </p> <p>Zirin excels at putting the fangs back in. He reminds us just how mad, bad and dangerous to know Ali really was in the decade of the civil rights struggle and the Vietnam War. And how badly and brutally abused he was as a result. </p> <p>The same goes for Jackie Robinson \u2013 now the hero of countless beautifully illustrated children's' books about how Nice Jackie (by being patient and very, very polite) broke the colour bar in baseball. And why, as a direct result, everything in America is now wonderful. The truth, as Zirin shows, is that the real Jackie Robinson was hardcore. He had to be. </p> <p>As you'd expect, Zirin spends plenty of time on Ali and Robinson \u2013 and on Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the sprinters who gave the black power salute at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. But if you think you know their stories, Zirin will probably surprise you. The shit that was rained down on the heads of these heroes \u2013 from conservatives and liberals alike \u2013 was incredible, and has largely been forgotten. Zirin gives a new spin to that dismissive phrase \"gesture politics\". Some gestures destroy careers and provoke death threats \u2013 and can carry on messing up your life for decades. </p> <p>And there's a hell of lot of history in the book you almost certainly don't know about at all (my copy has the top corner turned down on just about every other page). There's Billy Mills, an Oglala Sioux who won a gold medal in the 10,000 metres at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Mills \">who quit the sport a year later to protest the war in Vietnam. </a><br> There's Notre Dame coach Ara Parseghian caling hippies \"scum\" and banning beards. There's college track star Larry James seeing white students give a standing ovation when they get news of the assassination of Martin Luther King and, that same day, having another student shout \"run, nigger, run!\" as he jogged to a track meet. </p> <p>In the 1960s, in universities all over the US, the authorities turned a blind eye to athletes physically attacking anti-war demonstrators (including teachers), effectively turning many athletic departments into right-wing goon squads. Then, as now \u2013 in the <a href=\"http://www.counterpunch.org/zirin12272003.html \">words of professional American footballer and anti-war activist David Meggysey</a>\u2014 \"there was this jingoistic, super patriotic use of football, particularly during the Superbowl, to sell the war.\" </p> <p>But it's what happened next, brilliantly told in the chapter Sports on the Edge of Panic, that is truly amazing. As much as the head-in the-sand liberals and die-hard conservatives tried to \"keep politics out of sport\" (by which they meant left-wing, radical or progressive politics \u2013 they had no problem with flag-waving) the struggles of the 1960s seeped into every corner of US sports, including football. </p> <p>As Zirin shows, by 1968 many of the jocks expected by the authorities to keep the freaks in line (and to set a good, unquestioningly patriotic war-supporting example) were striking, protesting and marching alongside the freaks. Playing for the St Louis Cardinals, David Meggyesy started organising his teammates and circulating a petition against the war. His on-road roommate Rick Sortun \"had been a Goldwater Republican in 1964... <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/labpics/repository/v/antiwar/ludwig/ludwig0011_800.jpg.html \">When he came back from training camp in 1968 [he was] a member of the Young Socialist Alliance.\"</a> <br> One of the most amazing protests took place at the University of Washington's Husky stadium in 1972 where \u2013 to protest the war \u2013 the players in the venerable and high-profile varsity-alumni game refused to take the field for the second half until a statement announcing the team's opposition to the war was read over the public address system. </p> <p>\"A half a stadium of captive Nixon supporters, stuck in their seats, unable to ignore their idols' antiwar beliefs\" went predictably berserk with rage and frustration. But, says eyewitness Dean Paton, quoted in A People's History, they were drowned out by anti-war football fans. </p> <p>That's anti-war American football fans, cheering anti-war American footballers, one of whom, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kopay \">Dave Kopay</a> \u2013 who had to be restrained from launching himself at the abuse-screaming right wingers \u2013 \"later made history as the first retired male athlete to come out of the closet.\" </p> <p>There's tons of stuff like this in Zirin's book. At times the narrative suffers under the sheer weight of information, and the inevitable concentration on football, baseball and basketball \u2013 and on the 1960s and 70s \u2013 means there are gaps. I'd have liked a lot more on colonial sport, on the English roots of baseball, the (class and race related) decline of cricket and on the history of US soccer. But these are the quibbles of a jealous Englishman. </p> <p>\"There is A People's History of British Sports that needs to be written,\" says Zirin. \"I'm not the one to do it, but some political descendant of CLR James is out there somewhere. Please get to it post-haste.\" </p> <p>A People's History rescues scores of real sporting heroes from the \"vast realm of the forgotten\" and it's a great read, not to mention a great source of material with which to bash Guardian Unlimited's mysteriously numerous conservative blog responders over the head. \"I wrote it,\" says Zirin, \"because we learn about history not only to understand the past, but lay claim to the future. And if we can reclaim sports, if we can crash down the palace gates of play, there's no telling what we can go after next.\" </p> <p>Well, gosh. Something to think about there the next time you read some footie reporter finish an interview with: \"So, Wayne, tell us what you think about the new Nike Predator.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Chinese tainted milk scare spread to ice cream and yoghurt today as health investigators found further traces of the chemical that has killed at least three infants and left more than 6,000 ill.</p> <p>Thousands of parents took their children to hospital for health checks after unconfirmed reports that the chemical melamine had claimed a fourth victim. </p> <p>An independent food watchdog in Hong Kong found eight out of the 30 dairy products they tested contained traces of the chemical, normally used in plastics. Hong Kong authorities immediately ordered the withdrawal of the latest goods, produced by the Chinese firm Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group.</p> <p>Constance Chan, the controller of Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety, told Reuters: \"We are recalling the Yili products and the importer is also recalling all Yili products from the Yili brand.</p> <p>\"That would involve milk, milk beverages, yoghurt, ice cream and ice bar. Eight out of 30 products of Yili company contain melamine.\"</p> <p>China had previously identified melamine only in milk powder.</p> <p>\"In the next few days we will test all other mainland Chinese (dairy) products,\" Chan said. \"Any Chinese milk powder no matter where it is made on the mainland will be tested.\"</p> <p>Police in China today arrested 12 more people as part of their investigation. There were already 18 suspects being held and another 87 summoned for questioning.</p> <p>News of the contamination first began with reports that dozens of babies in Gansu province had developed kidney stones after drinking milk formula.</p> <p>Officials said subsequent tests found melamine in batches at 22 of China's 109 milk powder manufacturers, including its two biggest dairies, Mengniu and Yili Industrial Group.</p> <p>The health minister, Chen Zhu, said that 6,244 babies had fallen ill, 1,327 were in hospital and 158 had acute kidney failure. He expected the number of cases to rise.</p> <p>Chen said that so far all the sick infants had consumed milk powder made by the Sanlu group, the country's biggest formula producer. Li Changjiang, the head of China's quality control agency, said 5,000 inspectors would monitor companies and all dairy products would be tested for melamine.</p> <p>The chemical is banned from use in food, but adding it to watered-down milk makes it appear higher in protein when tested.</p> <p>China has tried to tighten food safety after repeated scares. In 2004, more than 200 infants suffered malnutrition and at least 12 died after being fed formula containing no nutrients. An estimated 1,500 dogs and cats died in the US last year from a melamine-tainted pet food ingredient made in China.</p> <p>The Sanlu case is particularly alarming because the recall took so long and apparently required the intervention of the New Zealand government, which was alerted by Sanlu's New Zealand-based partner, Fonterra. New Zealand's prime minister, Helen Clark, said on Monday that she ordered her officials to leapfrog regional authorities and tell Beijing directly.</p> <p>Today, Shi Guizhong, a spokesman for the Hebei provincial police, said government officials were starting a 10-day campaign to focus on the melamine contamination.</p> <p>Officers had confiscated 300kg (660lb) of suspected chemicals, including 490lb of melamine, he said.</p> <p>Shi said one suspect, surnamed Su, told police that from February 2007 to July 2008 he bought 200 sacks each containing 20kg of melamine and sold them all to milk suppliers.</p> <p>Yang Chongyong, the deputy governor of Hebei province, where Sanlu is based, said the firm received customer complaints from March but waited until August 2 before telling the city government of Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital. Officials there waited more than a month, until September 9, to tell the provincial government.</p> <p>The Hebei authorities took the problem to central government the following day and Sanlu finally ordered a recall.</p> <p>Andrew Ferrier, the chief executive of Fonterra, which owns 43% of Sanlu, said it had urged disclosure \"from day one\".</p> <p>The state news agency Xinhua reported that the mayor and four other city officials of Shijiazhuang had been fired. Sanlu's general manager, Tian Wenhua, was arrested, along with milk suppliers who were either arrested or questioned.</p> <p>China is the world's second largest market for infant formula. Ding Bing, the China coordinator for the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action, said: \"The milk powder companies do advertisements which exaggerate the effects of their products and make the mothers doubt [the quality of] their own milk.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Additional research by Chen Shi</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan today said it had not been warned about a US missile strike in a north-western tribal region despite assurances from Washington that it respected the Muslim nation's sovereignty. </p> <p>Four missiles were fired from unmanned US drone aircraft at a suspected militant hideout in a village in South Waziristan yesterday, killing at least six people and injuring three others. </p> <p>The strike came at dusk as villagers prepared to break their fast for Ramadan.</p> <p>Recent cross-border operations by US forces targeting Taliban and al-Qaida militants believed to be using the tribal areas to launch attacks against US-led troops in Afghanistan have caused public uproar in Pakistan. </p> <p>They have also strained government-level relations between the two countries, close allies in the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, yesterday \"reiterated the US commitment to respect Pakistan's sovereignty and to develop further US-Pakistani cooperation and coordination\".</p> <p>Pakistan's foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, described Mullen's statement as a \"clear commitment\" by the US to respect Pakistan's sovereignty. </p> <p>\"If, having said that, there was an attack later in the night, that means there is some sort of an institutional disconnect on their side and, if so, they will have to sort it out,\" he added. </p> <p>Qureshi said Pakistani officials \"were not informed\" of yesterday's operation, but asked Pakistanis to avoid issuing \"emotional statements\" about cross-border attacks. </p> <p>He said he planned to give a \"very honest and frank assessment of what we are gaining and what we are losing by such actions\" in forthcoming talks with US officials.</p> <p>The Pakistani defence minister, Ahmed Mukhtar - speaking before yesterday's strike - said the country \"would not allow anyone to take action on its soil as it has capacity to deal with the terrorists\".</p> <p>The prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, \"strongly condemned\" yesterday's operation.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Pakistan's military said it had been ordered to fire on US troops if they entered Pakistani territory.</p>",
  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>How have food fashions changed?</strong></p> <p>The evolving menus at high-profile restaurants are a good clue to changing food fashions. This month, the restaurant at London's <strong>Oxo Tower</strong> is celebrating its twelfth birthday. It is marking the occasion with a 12-course tasting menu, featuring a dish from each year it has been open. A quick glance at the menu shows that our tastes have changed dramatically over the last decade.</p> <p>So did we want to tuck into then, and what tastes good now? Amazingly, in the nineties Britons were still in thrall to French cuisine. Foie gras featured in the dish from 1997, and frogs' legs and snails were key over the next couple of years. But by the end of the decade, the long years of French dominance were coming to an end \u2026</p> <p>At the turn of the millennium, a new cuisine was the talk of the town: Japanese. From 2000 to 2003, the Oxo menu was full of wasabi, edamame and enoki mushrooms, following the popularity of the jet set's favourite restaurant, Nobu. This cuisine complemented the noughties' obsession with food and health: 'superfoods' like seaweed were <em>de rigeur</em>. The exoticism and exclusivity associated with Japanese food was an added appeal. But by the time sushi appeared in Sainsbury's, the fashion pack had long since moved on.</p> <p>In recent years, it's all been about British food. The focus has moved to the provenance of the ingredients, and the buzzwords are regional, seasonal, simple, fresh. The Oxo dish from 2004 encapsulates the new mood: Yorkshire venison with black pudding and pumpkin. Later dishes feature mead, oatcakes, wild strawberries, clotted cream: bygone English summers on a plate.</p> <p>Nibbles hopes that our newfound pride in our food heritage is no passing fad, and British fare stays firmly in fashion.</p> <p><em>The Oxo Tower tasting menu is available until October 31. Reservations can be <a href=\"http://www.harveynichols.com/output/Page387.asp\">made online</a></em></p> <h2>IN SEASON</h2> <p><strong>Buffalo mozzarella</strong></p> <p>OK, we're cheating a tiny bit, because mozzarella doesn't have a season as such \u2013 it's just best eaten as fresh as possible. But early autumn is a particularly good time, as the water buffalo have gorged on lush grass all summer. You may be lucky enough to find fresh buffalo mozzarella at your local farmers' market (we like <a href=\"http://www.buffalo-organics.co.uk/\">Alham Wood Cheeses</a> from Somerset). If not, befriend your local Italian deli owner to find out when the mozzarella is delivered, so you can get it at its best.</p> <p>Mozzarella is a particularly chic cheese at the moment \u2013 neophiles have dubbed it 'the new sushi' \u2013 and its popularity is reflected in one of this month's new openings. <strong>Obika</strong> is the second London outpost of a mozzarella bar (the other branch is in Selfridges) that was first found Rome, Milan and Turin. Mozzarella aficionados can choose cheeses from different regions, or sample a smoked version, affumicata.

  "<p>The prison population in England and Wales could hit 95,800 by 2015 - a rise of nearly 15% on the present figure - the Ministry of Justice said today. </p> <p>The prisons minister, David Hanson, said the government was committed to jailing \"the most serious, dangerous, violent and persistent offenders in order to protect the public\". </p> <p>The government's projections range from 83,400 to 95,800. The medium projection is 89,700, an increase from current figures of 6,182 or more than 7%. </p> <p>Hanson said the government's prison building and renovation plans would increase capacity to more than 96,000 by 2014. </p> <p>\"We will always ensure we have enough prison places for those offenders who need to be locked up,\" he said. </p> <p>Even the highest projection suggests a sharp slowdown in the prison population increase. Since 2000 it has increased by nearly 30% from an average of 64,600. </p> <p>Overcrowding has forced ministers to release more than 34,000 prisoners early since summer last year. </p> <p>Overall, the new numbers represent a significant downward revision of prison population predictions.<br> This time last year the range was much higher, with the top estimate for prison numbers put at 101,900. </p> <p>But changes to sentencing coming into force from this year and the introduction of early release have pushed the estimates down. </p> <p>The number of criminals given open-ended jail terms to protect the public will fall dramatically in the future, the projections document reveals. </p> <p>Under this year's Criminal Justice and Immigration Act, fewer serious or violent offenders will be given indeterminate sentences for public protection (IPPs). </p> <p>Around 140 criminals are given IPPs each month but this is expected to fall to 45. </p> <p>Under the Act, prisoners who break the terms of their release from prison and are re-jailed will automatically be released after 28 days. </p> <p>Currently they stay in prison until the end of their sentence or until the parole board agrees to their release. </p> <p>Prisoners given electronic tags while on remand will also be able to count that time against their sentence. </p> <p>The Ministry of Justice said the estimates were based on the early release scheme continuing. </p> <p>But ministers hope to end early release when enough prison places became available. </p> <p>Hanson said: \"When there is sufficient headroom between the prison population and capacity, we will look to end the temporary end of custody licence measure.\"</p>",
  "<p>For the past month, women in Georgia who were displaced from Abkhazia during the 1993 conflict have witnessed history moving backwards; everything they lived through 15 years ago is repeating itself. These women are now hosting a new flood of displaced civilians from Abkhazia and South Ossetia after Russia's aggression in those regions, as well as within the Georgian territories that Russian forces have occupied since the invasion. In Tbilisi alone, there are more than 500 camps for internally displaced people, many of them women and children living with shortages of food and <a href=\"http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=0ED335E8-15C5-F00A-253368F3F9A64E9D&amp;component=toolkit.article&amp;method=full_html\">medical supplies</a>.</p> <p>Georgians today hardly feel supportive of their president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who, in a foolish attempt to regain control over South Ossetia, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/georgia.russia\">turn its full military might</a> Russia to drop its peacekeeping mission in the region and to pushing Georgian troops out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and then to occupying much of Georgia. The Russians bombed numerous strategic and civilian targets in Georgia, destroying infrastructure resulting in shortages of food, fuel, and medicine. </p> <p>People are in despair; they are angry at Russia for its aggression and at their own government for provoking this uneven conflict. People of different nationalities and ethnicities have been living in this region side by side for centuries, sharing customs, traditions, bread and wine, and mutual respect for each another's cultures and languages. But, going back to the Russian, British, and Ottoman Empires that once battled here, they have been continually exploited by politicians and generals. </p> <p>Women and children suffer the most in times of conflict. Add to this centuries-old patriarchal traditions, 15-year-old post-war traumas, a 20-year economic crisis, and current Russian aggression, and you may begin to grasp what women in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Georgia are enduring these days. </p> <p>Besides the general devastation that modern warfare brings, impoverished and angry Russian soldiers were wreaking havoc on civilians by stealing belongings left behind and raping women. In addition, lawlessness was enticing bandits to cross the border and vandalise and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/14/georgia.russia\">rob properties</a> left by fleeing refugees. News reports and \"analysis\" by state-controlled channels in both Russia and Georgia that promote negative images of \"the enemy\" serve only to widen the gap between ethnic groups. </p> <p>Over the past month, concerned citizens in both Russia and Georgia have started to make attempts to build alliances and reach out to each other outside of the government-controlled media and structures. There have been action calls and statements circulated on the web calling on the people of the region to unite and not allow governments to build bigger walls between them. </p> <p>Despite government propaganda, the region's people must remember that Russians are not superior to Georgians, Georgians to Ossetians or Abkhazians, and so on. We need to stop these territorial battles based on national pride and desire to control and rule. Saakashvili must be pressured to abandon his effort to wield full control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia. At the same time, the Russian government must be pressured to pull out of the Caucasus and let people there decide their future for themselves. </p> <p>Now is the time for Georgian, Russian, Abkazian, and Ossetian civilians who are bearing the brunt of the conflict to come together to stop imperial chess games that kill thousands of people and leave thousands more displaced and emotionally wounded. It is time to help civil society in this area build a world where peace, not warfare, is the rule. </p> <p>Women's rights activists in the region should not fall into a brainwashing trap of nationalism and territorial disputes, becoming another tool in the hands of politicians. They should demonstrate to their governments that they will not succumb to divisive ideology. </p> <p><em> Angelika Arutyunova is programme officer for Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) at the Global Fund for Women.</em></p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps I should be worried. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/24/politics?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=books\">the new book Cameron on Cameron</a> by GQ editor Dylan Jones, the Tory leader says that his favourite author is Graham Greene, and that he went through a frantic phase of reading all the novels. </p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene\">Graham Greene</a> is my favourite author as well, and like the man with the windmill on his house, I have descended into the seedy world of rain-soaked London, rotted my liver in mosquito-bitten outposts of the British Empire, and sought redemption in leper colonies \u2013 figuratively speaking, of course. I even made it onto the racecourse at Brighton, although resisted the urge to razor rival gangs.</p> <p>Graham Greene's novels usually pit morally drifting souls against even worse types, in trying circumstances \u2013 it's either too hot, too cold or too wet, and danger is never too far away. Some sort of redemption takes place, then bang \u2013 they are obliterated; their lives, loves, crimes and misdemeanours shovelled back into the box, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOd0DJ_iaAQ\">Camberwick Green</a> for grown-ups. </p> <p>Cameron's already played his Smiths-worshipping card, defeating Hazel Blears' silly attempts to prevent him being snapped outside Salford Lads' Club. His latest revelation puts me in danger of \u2013 if not actually liking him; that would be dangerously na\u00efve \u2013 at least recognizing his human-like traits, wondering exactly what his progressive vision of England looks like \u2026 I'm guessing Harold Macmillan, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ybCjf6ras\">Telstar</a> and compost toilets, and fearing for his survival, since most of Greene's greatest characters are doomed.</p> <p>I am pretty sure he doesn't identify with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/media/rm550411264/tt0039220\">Pinkie Brown, the baby-faced killer</a>, surrounded by incompetent villains twice his age. Scobie perhaps, in Heart of the Matter, although that would suggest a lack of drive. Anthony Farrant in England Made Me bears a better resemblance: English upper class, seemingly lacking in substance, likeable though slippery (but when the crunch comes, not slippery enough) and quite decent really \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/g/graham-greene/england-made-me.htm\">he ends up face down in the river</a>.</p> <p>It's strange to be the same age, and to share similar tastes to the probable next prime minister \u2013 the inexorable march of time and all that. Although never an avid Smiths fan, I admire Morrissey's lyrics \u2026 and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpD-_bVqC2I\">Boz Boorer's guitar playing</a>, while getting the New York Dolls back together for Meltdown deserves a knighthood in itself, which he'll probably soon get. But I've never met a Graham Greene fan I haven't liked \u2026 you see where the worrying creeps in?</p> <p>Perhaps he's got <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1q994Mh92w\">Black Box Recorder on his iPod</a>, which wouldn't be the end of the world. (I once met someone whose bands were listed on George Bush's; he was a broken man.) Maybe Dave sings John Cale's We're Having Tea with Graham Greene in the shower, bellowing out the chorus \"<a href=\"http://www.metrolyrics.com/graham-greene-lyrics-john-cale.html\">Welcome back to Chipping Sodbury</a>\" with perfect Welsh enunciation.</p> <p>However, voting for somebody who shares my tastes is another matter. With the exception of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Ferdinand_C\u00e9line\">C\u00e9line</a>, it's difficult to think of a more cynical writer than Greene. World-weary contempt and thinly veiled misanthropy are great for writers, but perhaps running a country requires something a bit more uplifting.</p> <p>Mind you, if he comes up with any more surprises \u2013 <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2006/04/20/nyc_album_art_n_1.php\">being photographed with Boris, George and Oliver on St Marks Place in spandex and platforms for instance</a> - I'll be putting my name on the candidate list and standing at the next by-election.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1) Faldo's finest hour (1995)</strong></p> <p>For a man who has made off with six majors \u2013 and is arguably the greatest, certainly the most undervalued, sporting hero Britain has ever produced \u2013 Nick Faldo's career is almost completely bereft of signature moments and stir few specific memories. His triple Open haul is largely boiled down in the public consciousness to those 18 consecutive pars at Muirfield in 1987, while his three Masters successes roughly equate in most people's recollection to one thundering Antipodean nervous breakdown. But there are three holes of golf for which, come time, he will surely be best remembered. And ironically, for a player who forged a career standing at a self-imposed distance from his peers, the public and the press (like he'd care about that last one), his crowning glory came in the most selfless arena of all.</p> <p>Faldo's major successes seem so unspectacular in retrospect because of his sheer bloody-minded refusal to crack under the greatest pressure. In the 1995 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill, Europe needed someone with that mindset more than ever, because it was beginning to look like the momentum the team had built up in the 1980s was about to be lost for good. After holding the trophy from 1985 through 1989, it was surrendered at the War on the Shore at Kiawah Island to the USA, who then effortlessly held onto the trophy two years later at the Belfry in 1993. With the States going into the 1995 singles two points up, Europe's run of success suddenly began to look like a blip rather than a sea change.</p> <p>The outcome of the 1995 Cup would hinge on Faldo's singles rubber with Curtis Strange, who only needed a half to effectively secure the cup for the Americans. When Strange found himself two up and in the centre of the fairway on 16 while Faldo was faffing around in the trees, the jig looked up for Europe. But, seemingly sure to at least halve the hole and go dormie two, Strange sliced a simple six-iron approach then failed to get up and down, while Faldo scrambled a par. The American duly fell to pieces, missing two short par putts on the final two greens. Faldo remained staunch, parring both holes. His chip to four feet at the last was exquisite; the subsequent putt, when four feet seemed like 40, was sunk with jelly legs but minimal fuss. It was Philip Walton who went on to technically secure the Cup, but with only one point separating the teams by the end, the victory was all down to a turnaround effected by one man.</p> <p>\"It's funny, but some were saying that if the US had walloped the Euros as predicted, it would be the end of the great era of Ryder Cup matches,\" wrote Rick Reilly in Sports Illustrated that year. \"US routs were supposed to start piggybacking, and the Ryder Cup would revert to a complicated dinner party with some golf thrown in for effect. But with this result the US leads 5-4 since Europe joined the fray in 1979, and the next instalment, in Spain in '97, looks like it could be epic.\" It wasn't to be. But without Faldo, the 1990s could easily have been a clean sweep for the States, and subsequent Cups could have taken a very different turn.</p> <p><strong>2) Leonard's 40-footer (1999)</strong></p> <p>\"I have a good feeling about tomorrow, that's all I'm saying,\" the US captain Ben Crenshaw predicted on the Saturday night at Brookline in 1999. It was some statement to be making: his team in tatters, Europe were going into the final day four points ahead, needing only another four from a possible 12 to secure the draw which would retain the trophy. But Crenshaw would be proved right. Europe capitulated feebly, risibly, pathetically: they lost the opening six singles matches of the day 3&amp;2, 4&amp;2, 4&amp;3, 6&amp;5, 3&amp;2 and 5&amp;4. Let's just read that again: 3&amp;2, 4&amp;2, 4&amp;3, 6&amp;5, 3&amp;2 and 5&amp;4. Hats off to the Americans, but Jesus H Christ on an electric kart.</p> <p>The die was pretty much cast there and then, but to put the tin lid on a painfully disastrous day, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal \u2013 essentially requiring a win against Justin Leonard to keep the Cup in Europe \u2013 threw away a seemingly unassailable lead. Four up with seven to play, Ollie lost four of the next five holes. Then, on the 17th, Leonard drained <em>that</em> snaking 40-foot birdie putt and all hell broke loose. Of course Olaz\u00e1bal could still technically keep his hopes of a win alive by sinking his own 20-footer, but everyone knew it was time to pack up and go home.</p> <p>Be honest: after as good as completing the mother of all comebacks, can you blame the Americans for stampeding across Olaz\u00e1bal's line? Can you <em>really</em>? Ollie missed his putt, like he was always going to do, and all the subsequent huff, puff and bluster let an awful lot of Europeans off the hook \u2013 and obscured an amazing American performance, for which they have never been given proper credit this side of the ocean.</p> <p><strong>3) Irwin's snap hook (1991)</strong></p> <p>Brooklinelinegate, or whatever that Leonard-related nonsense is known as, would end up becoming the biggest controversy the Ryder Cup had ever seen. Which shows just how much a spontaneous (OK, admittedly thoughtless) celebration was blown wildly out of proportion \u2013 because what happened at Kiawah Island eight years earlier was a heinous disgrace.</p> <p>It was bad enough that the Americans, waging war in Kuwait at the time, had whipped themselves up into a doltish militaristic frenzy (The War On The Shore: what on <em>earth</em> were they thinking about?!?). Bad enough that Corey Pavin spent most of the week trundling around in an aggressive macho fervour, twirling his 'tache and gripping his driver like it was an extension to his front tail. Bad enough that US captain Dave Stockton couldn't be bothered to inform his opposite number Bernard Gallacher that Steve Pate would have to sit out the singles because of injury. But what happened on the final hole of the final match, in which Bernard Langer needed to beat Hale Irwin to ensure Europe retained the Cup, was frankly unforgivable.</p> <p>Level on the tee, Irwin hit the mother, father and extended family of all snap hooks, winging his ball 50 yards to the left. By the time the players had walked up the fairway, however, the ball was sitting up nicely in the semi-rough. It was the first time in golfing history that a hideous hook had turned mid-air into a vicious slice, ending up almost straight down the middle. Either that, or it had taken a friendly 'bounce' off someone in the home crowd. Who could possibly tell. \"It was pretty strange,\" mused Langer afterwards. \"From the tee it looked like he was 45, 50 yards left. When we got there it was on the edge of the fairway.\"</p> <p>Irwin could still only manage a bogey. Langer struggled up the hole too and was left with a tricky downhill six-footer for par to win. Unfortunately there were spike marks on his line, and so to avoid them he was forced to rattle the ball towards the cup dead straight. The ball broke right. Langer's head snap-hooked back as he emitted a primal scream, while the US began to shamelessly cavort around the shop. Those celebrations were never met by Europe with the rancour which followed the Brookline prancing, but they should have been. This was much, much worse.</p> <p><strong>4) Nicklaus's concession (1969)</strong></p> <p>Great Britain hadn't won the Ryder Cup since 1957 at Lindrick in Yorkshire, and this would prove to be the only time they'd get close until the Europeans were admitted into the competition in 1979. The match ended, famously, in a sporting draw, meaning the Americans retained their cup while the Brits took all the plaudits for a strong showing. Although if the harsh truth is told, Britain really should have received pelters for not winning the match.</p> <p>That's because morale in the US team was, according to an unnamed player, \"rock bottom\". Captain Sam Snead tinkered unnecessarily with his pairings, leaving Jack Nicklaus and the in-form Gene Littler out of the opening matches. Britain were at one point 6-4 up in the tie, but let the shambolic Americans, almost single-handedly buoyed by Lee Trevino, back into the match: by the end of the second day the scores were level at 8-8. In the singles, Britain then squandered another healthy lead of 13-11, allowing the Americans to level the match, with one tie remaining, at 15\u00bd points each. That tie, of course, was between Nicklaus and the newly-crowned Open champion Tony Jacklin, who ensured it would go right down to the wire by draining a 50-foot eagle putt to level the match at the 17th.</p> <p>In truth, the final hole was relatively drama free, both players reaching the green in regulation. Jacklin having left himself a two-foot putt for par, Nicklaus rolled in an ice-cool five-footer for his. Nicklaus then astonished the crowd by picking up Jacklin's marker to concede the putt. \"I don't think you would have missed that, Tony,\" said the Golden Bear, \"but I didn't want to give you the chance.\" Nicklaus had denied America a chance of winning the 1969 match had Jacklin suffered a dose of the yips, but with a draw already assured and the Cup retained, he saw no need to put his opponent needlessly through the wringer.</p> <p>That the 1969 event is remembered for one of the great acts of sportsmanship is somewhat ironic. Snead went ballistic as a result of Nicklaus's largesse, using choice words such as eff and cee, while from the off the event had been played under a cloud after British captain Eric Brown, a member of Britain's last winning team in 1957, told his men not to help in the search for any American balls lost in the rough.</p> <p><strong>5) Seve's three-wood (1983)</strong></p> <p>Great Britain failed to build on their draw at Birkdale in 1969, going backwards at a rate of knots and receiving regular thrashings during the 1970s. By the end of the decade, the rest of Europe was drafted in to bail the Brits out, although improvement was not immediate: a 17-11 defeat for the first all-European side in 1979 was followed by an 18\u00bd-9\u00bd humping in the heather at Walton Heath in 1981.</p> <p>Tony Jacklin's arrival as captain ahead of the 1983 rubber at the PGA National, however, raised the bar. Jacklin concentrated on the details \u2013 first-class travel, an insistence on well-tailored uniforms instead of the garish clown costumes with which British and European teams had previously been kitted out \u2013 which made his team feel special. Better performances would follow as a result. It also helped that Europe stopped playing silly buggers and picked their best player. In 1981, Seve Ballesteros had been omitted from the team because it was argued he was playing too much golf in the States. Jacklin had no truck with such lunacy; Seve was in.</p> <p>Ironically it was Seve's match that would ultimately lose the 1983 Cup for Europe: three up after 11 in the opening singles tie against Fuzzy Zoeller, he let the lead slip and had to play the shot of the tournament on the last to salvage a half \u2013 a 250-yard three-wood from a fairway bunker which reached the edge of the green. Effectively a point swing to the USA, Seve's result saw Europe lose momentum: at one point leading in six matches and tying two others, they eventually lost the session 6\u00bd-5\u00bd and the Cup by a point. But though Seve had failed in the final analysis, he had gone down fighting like hell. This was the year Europe realised that if they dug in, they would eventually beat the Americans.</p> <p><strong>6) Torrance's birdie (1985)</strong></p> <p>And two years later, at the Belfry, they did, Sam Torrance creaming his approach at the last to 18 feet, then sinking the winning putt, followed by several flutes of the finest champagne. Aaaaaah. That tastes real good.</p> <p>Seventeen years later, he would again be drenched in the stuff, captaining the side to a dramatic victory at the scene of his arms-aloft triumph back in the day. It ended up being a comfortable victory, but for one split second, it seemed the Cup might somehow be snatched from his grasp when Paul Azinger, staring defeat in the face, kept the USA alive by holing out from a greenside bunker to deny Niclas Fasth a point. It wouldn't matter, though, Paul McGinley putting the affair to bed by halving with Jim Furyk in the very next match.</p> <p>Azinger's shot, you'll have no doubt noted, was the last time anyone from the USA put up any sort of fight in the Ryder Cup, a shoddy state of affairs and no mistake. The Americans will be glad he's involved again this time round.</p>",
  "<p>There's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udm9RZ_MH6o\">a certain horror film from the 1970s</a> which became famous for the tagline \"keep repeating, 'It's only a movie',\" included in order to convince terrified patrons that it wasn't actually real. I can't help thinking that a similar tagline should be applied to Eurobeat, the Eurovision musical which has arrived in London's West End after a successful tour of the UK. As a Eurovision devotee, I was champing at the bit to see it \u2013 since there are certain aspects of this flamboyant spectacle which are so scarily accurate that the average fan of the contest may forget that the whole thing is in fact being staged purely for entertainment purposes. Think soap fans who become convinced their favourite EastEnders character has really died and you'll get the idea.</p> <p>Eurovision has always been the kind of thing that lends itself to audience participation. It does at my house, where it's long been the tradition to have a big group of people round to watch the contest itself, poke fun at the bad songs, cheer on the good ones and then sulk when our favourites inevitably lose. </p> <p>One year I even hit upon the idea of making each guest choose a country at the door, whom they would support during the course of the evening \u2013 so it came as something of a surprise to discover that the Eurobeat experience began at the theatre door, where patrons are invited to randomly select a badge which will be the country they will have to root for (Hungary, in my case; Russia for my companion). Could I have a plagiarism case on my hands? Somehow I doubt it. And audience participation (aided by clackers, flags and other merchandise) is actively encouraged as well as voting for your favourite song by mobile phone, with the results depending on the poll (it is a different winner every night, we're told).</p> <p>Once the show actually begins, it's obvious that writers Craig Christie and Andrew Patterson have done their homework \u2013 with the likes of Sweden represented by a perky Abba-style quartet, the UK by a couple of chavvy singers with a pointless ballad, Iceland by a Bjork-alike singing a tuneless, meaningless song. Ten countries get to strut their stuff, while <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Dennis\">Les Dennis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.melandsue.co.uk/\">Mel Giedroyc</a> play the over-enthusiastic Bosnian hosts (but hold on, why no Bosnia and Herzegovina in the contest itself?). They yap away in multi-lingual double entendres and deliver a scarily accurate representation of your average mittel-European Eurovision presenter (see Tallinn 2002 or <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/2005/05/21/the_50th_eurovision_song_contest_minute_by_minute_commentary.html\">Kiev 2005</a> for further evidence).</p> <p>There are certain anomalies here \u2013 Italy is represented, for example, when any Eurovision fan worth their salt knows they haven't participated since 1997. How about putting in \"<em>nul points</em>\" favourites Norway instead? Or metal-obsessed Finland? Or even Israel \u2013 given their dalliances with transsexuals on the Eurovision stage the possibilities are endless.</p> <p>Like the real thing, it's all too easy to get drawn in to Eurobeat once the second act kicks in and the voting begins. There are ridiculous jurors to giggle at (Russia's fur-hatted spies acting in clandestine fashion, and Ireland's cross between a leprechaun and Gloria Hunniford are highlights), the odd bit of political voting, and even edge of the seat moments. Sadly it wasn't to be for Hungary and their fantastically silly folk song, but a fight to the death between Poland and Russia. In the end Russia, represented by a tight-trousered boy band and their comically straight-faced dance number Ice Queen, won it, in a competition that wound up being almost as tense as the actual contest.</p> <p>I had to remind myself at this point \u2013 aided by my companion \u2013 that it was in fact only a show, and not the real thing at all. While it was on too small a scale to be quite as exciting as the big night itself, I still left with the same kind of buzz that your average Eurovision nut gets from watching a particularly good contest.</p> <p>And as I pointed out on the way out, wouldn't it been nice if that had been the actual <a href=\"http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=1098\">Russian song that won Eurovision this year</a>?</p>",
  "<p>Last week, the Royal Ballet told a committee advising the Home Office that very few British applicants \"have the required level of artistic excellence or aesthetics\" to dance with the company. As a result, foreign ballet-dancers wishing to work in Britain have joined sheep-shearers, jockeys and hovercraft drivers on a list of those exempted from tough new immigration regulations.</p> <p>Let's deconstruct the Royal Ballet's statement. What they're actually saying is not only that most British-trained dancers aren't technically good enough to join the company, but that most of them are also the wrong shape. If this is true, a number of questions are begged. Across the UK, there are no less than 10 establishments offering full-time vocational training in classical ballet, including the <a href=\"http://www.royal-ballet-school.org.uk/\">Royal Ballet School</a>. Is it really the case that of the 100 or so students graduating each year, only \"very few\" are skillful or presentable enough to make the grade?</p> <p>Monica Mason, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/19/arts.artsnews\">director of the Royal Ballet</a>, recruits her dancers internationally and takes the best she can get. She herself is South African-born, and was one of many dancers from Commonwealth countries (others included Wayne Eagling and Lynn Seymour) without whose presence the Royal would have been infinitely the poorer. So the company has always drawn from far and wide. But at the same time the schools, and particularly the RBS, have always provided the company with a steady stream of local talent.</p> <p>Over the last decade this stream has all but dried up, and of those dancers going into the Royal Ballet company from the school, a high percentage have been students recruited overseas, polished for a few terms, and rebranded as RBS graduates. They join a company whose upper ranks are almost wholly international. Out of 20-odd principal dancers only three \u2013 Rupert Pennefather, Lauren Cuthbertson and Edward Watson \u2013 are homegrown. And three is the most there has been for some years. International stars make for a lustrous ensemble and a big reputation on the world stage, but globalisation has social consequences. The fewer homegrown artists the company employs, the more it distances itself from the community which furnishes its talent-base and its audience. Twenty-five years ago, the Royal Ballet was still mostly British-born. On leaving the company, many of those homegrown dancers set up as teachers, feeding a new generation through the schools. That thread \u2013 that continuity - is now broken, and the results for British ballet have been catastrophic. A sideways glance at football tells the same story: a national skill-base weakened, possibly beyond repair, by a vast influx of foreign players.</p> <p>It doesn't have to be this way. <a href=\"http://www.nycballet.com/nycb/home/\">New York City Ballet</a> recruits overwhelmingly from the School of American Ballet, and 99 percent of the dancers of the <a href=\"http://www.operadeparis.fr/Saison-2008-2009/Ballets.asp\">Paris Opera Ballet</a> \u2013 arguably the most beautifully finished company in the world - are graduates of its own school. Mason, I'm sure, would be very happy to see this happening at the Royal. It would get critics like me off her back, for a start. But perhaps it's time for us to stop giving her a hard time over this issue. Perhaps she simply has no room to manoeuvre. </p> <p>Here's the situation. In 1999 Gailene Stock arrived in London from the Australian Ballet School where she had been director. Her brief was to take over the Royal Ballet School, which was already, for a number of reasons, at a lowish ebb. \"That elegance and schooling, that impeccable presentation, that's not there any more,\" Stock told me at the time. In five years, she promised the board of governors, she would return the school to what it had been two decades earlier: the finest institution of its kind in the world. Well, nine years have passed, Stock is rumoured to have had her contract extended for another two, and there's still no sign of the promised renaissance. The barest trickle of dancers has progressed from the school to the company over the last few years, and the lethal delicacy of that statement to the Home Office sends an unambiguous message about the state of relations between the two.</p> <p>But perhaps part of the problem arises before would-be dancers get anywhere near an institution like the RBS. Perhaps Stock has no more room for manoeuvre than Mason. Many local ballet teachers have been all but forced out of business by rising studio-rents, byzantine health and safety requirements and astronomical insurance premiums. To survive they have had to hike their prices to the point where ballet classes are beyond the reach of all but the most comfortably off - and that's before a single pointe-shoe has been bought. And then there's the time factor. Even assuming one non-working parent - an increasingly rare set-up - the logistics of delivering a school-age child to an hour-long ballet class five or six times a week are horrendous. Small wonder that the pool of candidates from which vocational school principals like Stock have to draw is massively depleted. Small wonder that the streamlined kids who a generation ago would have dreamed of dancing Swan Lake are now hanging out at the leisure centre and getting into athletics, gymnastics or break-dancing. <a href=\"http://www.darceybussell.com/\">Darcey Bussell</a>, our last homegrown ballet star, was a huge inspiration to young girls all over the UK who related to her instinctively as one of their own. But Bussell has retired now, and starry though ballerinas like Alina Cojocaru and Tamara Rojo may be, their pictures are not blu-tacked to 10,000 bedroom walls.</p> <p>So the issue's not a simple one, and there are no easy answers. Properly inspired, as our Olympic athletes showed, young Britons will cheerfully submit to the most rigourous of regimes. But in the case of ballet, perhaps it's reached the point where that inspiration has to take a new form. Performers like Cojocaru and Rojo are not just supreme technicians - they're smart, self-reliant, lateral-thinking individualists. If Britons are to join their ranks in significant numbers, things have to change. And this isn't impossible. British contemporary dance is on a roll precisely because British contemporary dance schools concentrate on training the whole person, on ensuring that their graduates are inventive, adaptable and in touch with new creative thinking. If we want to continue seeing British ballet dancers in British ballet companies, then the entire system has to be rethought and rebuilt from the ground up. Children with potential need to be identified early, possibly through the reinstatement of local and national competitions, and they and their parents and teachers need to be properly supported. Transport, nutrition advice, affordable classes, cut-price pointe-shoes, visits to performances \u2013 whatever it takes. The Royal Ballet's <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/ballet-for-everyone-pupils-get-a-chance-to-dance-442232.html\">Chance to Dance</a> and Junior Associate schemes go part of the way, but they are necessarily small-scale. If British ballet is to survive it needs much more adventurous thinking and a properly funded national strategy. Otherwise we might as well admit that the game's up. That British kids who dream of following in the footsteps of Anthony Dowell and Antoinette Sibley, of Jonathan Cope and Darcey Bussell are simply not up to it, and that our national companies are just high-priced showcases for foreign talent. Is that really what we want?</p>"
