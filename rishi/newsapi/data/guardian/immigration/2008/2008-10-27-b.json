  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/15/canada-election-conservative-government\">re-election of Stephen Harper's Conservative party</a> to a minority government this month means Canada is being served a lukewarm plate of more-of-the-same as they watch their southern neighbour potentially elect a politician who might significantly change the face of politics. But as the status quo prevails in Ottawa, the status of American soldiers who fled to Canada after the outbreak of the Iraq war hangs in the balance. Many have argued that the fate of these soldiers could redefine Canada's relationship with the US, but, after the November election, they could also redefine America's own post-Bush position on the Iraq war itself.</p> <p>There are currently an estimated 200 US soldiers residing in Canada, who left the army without official consent after the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Canada's history of providing a safe haven for up to 50,000 young <a href=\"http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/clips/1928/\">Americans fleeing the draft during the Vietnam era</a>, along with its reputation for respecting human rights, has made it an obvious choice for deserting members of the US armed forces. All soldiers interviewed say their <a href=\"http://www.resisters.ca/resisters_stories.html\">reason for deserting the army</a> was the illegality of the Iraq war or the abuses perpetrated by their fellow soldiers.</p> <p>Although the Canadian parliament passed a non-binding motion in June in favour of allowing American deserters to stay, several have since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/16/antiwar.iraq\">lost their appeals against deportation</a>, and others await a similar fate, facing certain <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20080710.BCDEPORTATION10%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3DUS%2Bdeserters%2Bcorey&amp;ord=7467741&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true\">imprisonment if returned to the US</a>. Although this month's election didn't exactly give Harper a resounding mandate to rule, the re-election of the Conservatives means it is unlikely Canada will change it's tepid position to a Trudeau-era pledge to provide a \"refuge from militarism\" any time soon.</p> <p>The shift in attitude toward the American deserters from the Trudeau era to today is not confined to the ruling conservatives. While barely reported in the US media, the response in the Canadian press to these soldiers has been vocal but mixed. Even many who are vociferously opposed to George Bush insist that this is not Canada's problem to deal with. Jonathan Kay at Canada's conservative, Conrad Black-owned National Post has <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7444116.stm\">argued</a> that \"America's fair-weather soldiers shouldn't be permitted to make a mockery of a Canadian refugee system that was originally designed to protect migrants fleeing assassination and torture\" and points out that, in contrast to the Vietnam era, the US no longer has the draft.</p> <p>Campaigners against the deportation of soldiers point out that conscription could almost describe the reality of modern American army recruitment, because the temptation of army scholarships to severely disadvantaged teenagers works as a kind of a <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20030405.UROYYN_4%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3Droy%2Bmacgregor%252C%2Bpoverty%252C%2Bmilitary%2Bservice&amp;ord=3208224&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true\">de-facto draft for poor people</a>. Other campaigners point out that soldiers deserting from wars \"condemned by the international community\", are eligible for asylum status under UN rules, and that the 2003 invasion of Iraq - conducted without a UN mandate and subject to worldwide condemnation - undoubtedly fits this criteria.</p> <p>Unfortunately, these arguments don't really hold up to scrutiny. As much as one can empathise with the sense of betrayal felt by deserting soldiers who never thought they'd be asked to fight in an illegal war, as much as we can sympathise with working-class American teenagers being hoodwinked into joining the army with promises of scholarships, the fact that the US no longer conscripts its soldiers is a stumbling block that can't be dismissed.</p> <p>There's the very real argument that utilising the concept of \"asylum seekers\" for political ends runs the risk of making a mockery of those fleeing grave human rights abuses in their home country. (The extent to which the conservatives using this argument at the National Post truly care about \"genuine\" asylum seekers is another issue). That Canada's response to Iraq-era US deserters is different from its response during the Vietnam war does tell us something about how Canada has veered to the right, as progressive Canadians point out. But it is also a product of America no longer having the draft, and this can't be ignored either.</p> <p>This seems to be the conundrum that the deserting soldiers present. It's obvious that no one would benefit from seeing these soldiers prosecuted back in America, and that their likely post-traumatic stress and sense of conscience in the face of the Iraq war hardly makes them dangerous criminals, and yet drawing upon the language of refugees and asylum-seekers - which is currently the best mechanism the soldiers have to defend themselves against deportation - isn't an appropriate use of human rights legislation. <br> So what is to be done? Well, there is one alternative: America could decline to prosecute the soldiers once they are deported from Canada. And while no one could expect this to happen in the dying days of George Bush's lame-duck presidency, there is a real opportunity for anti-deportation campaigners in Barack Obama, who, if elected, could promise the US soldiers in Canada that they are free to return home without fear of incarceration.  Jimmy Carter famously <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/vietnam/vietnam_1-21-77.html\">pardoned Vietnam draft-dodgers</a> just days after his inauguration, having controversially promised to do so during his campaign. Given the differences between the Vietnam draft and today's conscientious objectors, such an overt route wouldn't be appropriate for Obama. Instead, a quiet acknowledgement that the soldiers residing in Canada could return without fear of prosecution would draw a line under the last eight years of disastrous US foreign policy, while keeping the language of refugees and asylum-seekers out of the debate in Canada, preserving it for those who have suffered genuine human rights abuses. By acknowledging that the US deserters were following their consciences on the illegality of the Iraq invasion, the new US administration could show its commitment to moving beyond the Bush era, and begin to repair bridges with the rest of the world.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/burma\">Burma</a> is ruled by one of the world's most brutal regimes, guilty not only of suppressing democracy but of causing one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. In response, the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm\">International Crisis Group (ICG)</a> has lost the plot.</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cyclonenargis\">Cyclone Nargis</a> hit Burma. Unlike almost any other government in response to a natural disaster, the junta in Burma initially refused, and then restricted and diverted international aid efforts. Aid was <a href=\"http://www.dhf.uu.se/pdffiler/burma_post_nargi_analysis.pdf\">stolen by the regime (pdf)</a>. Burmese people who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/23/burma-naturaldisasters\">tried to help deliver aid</a> were arrested. The little aid that was officially distributed was given for propaganda purposes and often taken back when the photocalls were over. At least 140,000 people died and 2.5 million left homeless in the wake of the regime's deliberate neglect.</p> <p>Following the cyclone another humanitarian crisis has unfolded, this time in <a href=\"http://eng.chro.org/images/stories/File/pdf/chro_report_critical_point.pdf\">western Burma (pdf)</a>. <a href=\"http://www.hart-uk.org/new/visitreports/hart_india_chin_08.pdf.\">Chin State (pdf)</a> has been hit by a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7633986.stm\">famine</a> caused by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/10/burma.famine)\">plague of rats</a> who multiply due to flowering of bamboo, a natural phenomenon that occurs every 50 years. True to form, the regime did nothing to prepare the people for the anticipated famine and has actively obstructed aid efforts. Officials took the <a href=\"http://www.unpo.org/content/view/8712/101/\">World Food Programme</a> to the wrong area, causing them to declare there was no famine. Since then, the WFP has revised its view \u2013 but the regime continues to block attempts to help the starving Chin people. </p> <p>Burma's military is continuing an offensive against ethnic peoples in eastern Burma, causing further humanitarian misery. Since 1996, <a href=\"http://www.tbbc.org/\">more than 3,200 villages</a> have been destroyed, and a million people displaced. Civilians are shot at point-blank range, or <a href=\"http://www.shanland.org/resources/bookspub/humanrights/LtoR/\">raped</a>, taken for forced labour or used as human minesweepers. Children are taken off the streets and <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/press/2002/10/burma-1016.htm\">forced to join the Burmese army</a>, which has the highest number of child soldiers in the world. <a href=\"http://www.aappb.org/\">Over 2,100 political prisoners</a> languish in jail, double the number of last year, subjected to horrific torture, and <a href=\"http://freeaungsansuukyi.org/FASSK\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>, Burma's pro-democracy leader and Nobel laureate, marked 13 years in house arrest last week.</p> <p>The International Crisis Group says this is all our fault. In one of the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5734&amp;l=1\">most extraordinary reports ever produced</a> by a responsible and until-now respected organisation, ICG provides a subtle defence of the junta and blames the international community for focusing too much on \"the political struggle\". It was understandable, ICG suggests, that the regime \"hesitated to provide full, unfettered access for anyone claiming to be doing relief work\", because the west has been putting the junta under so much pressure to stop killing its people. Western media is at fault too, according to ICG, for showing images of dead bodies being dumped by regime officials in the river \u2013 something that was \"very embarrassing\" for the poor generals.</p> <p>While grudgingly conceding that the root causes of the crisis are political, ICG appears to reject the notion that the solutions are therefore political too. The report rightly calls for more aid to Burma, and support for civil society projects, and warns that the country is on the verge of a major humanitarian crisis. I agree. The stories and statistics speak for themselves. But ICG goes on to perpetuate the lie that pro-democracy activists oppose aid. In reality, it is campaign groups that have called for more aid. </p> <p>It was the <a href=\"http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/\">Burma Campaign UK</a> and <a href=\"http://www.csw.org.uk/portal.htm\">Christian Solidarity Worldwide</a> that led the effort last year to get the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmintdev/645/64502.htm\">UK government to increase aid to Burma</a> \u2013 with success. We have been calling for more funding for civil society and democracy groups, for cross-border humanitarian relief and for <a href=\"http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/reports/Aid_Paper.pdf\">UN engagement for years (PDF)</a>. Much of our time has been spent on getting the generals to talk with the <a href=\"http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/reports/Burmaunscreport.pdf\">UN, the democracy movement and the ethnic groups (PDF)</a>. What we have opposed is ICG's call for money to go into the pockets of the regime \u2013 for the simple reason that the junta will use such finance to expand their army, buy more guns and kill more people. I thought ICG was about conflict prevention. Now it seems they are about regime protection.</p> <p><em>Benedict Rogers is advocacy officer for south Asia at <a href=\"http://www.csw.org.uk/portal.htm\">Christian Solidarity Worldwide</a> and the author of A Land Without Evil: Stopping the Genocide of Burma's Karen People.

  "<p>Democratic leaders are raising their hopes of an election year sweep - winning the White House, and achieving solid majorities in both houses of Congress to dominate Washington on a scale unseen in 40 years.</p> <p>With Obama ahead in the polls, and Democrats set to expand their majority in the House of Representatives, party leaders are focused on consolidating their control of the Senate.</p> <p>Democratic as well as Republican leaders now believe it is possible Democrats will reach the magical number of 60 seats in the Senate.</p> <p>That would give the Democrats what is called a filibuster-proof majority, making it impossible for Republicans to cut off debate or limit legislation.</p> <p>If Barack Obama wins the White House, that would bring a consolidation of Democratic power in Washington unseen since the 1960s.</p> <p>\"This is a tectonic race,\" Charles Schumer, the New York senator who is overseeing the Democrats' Senate election campaign, told reporters last week. \"This will change things not just for an election cycle but a generation.\"</p> <p>A wave of anti-Republican sentiment, coupled with excitement over Obama's candidacy that has brought more Democrats to the polls in early voting, has seen Democrats predicting far bigger gains than expected even a few weeks ago.</p> <p>John McCain's faltering campaign for the White House has also hurt Republican candidates in battleground states.</p> <p>Both parties are now using the prospect of a filibuster-proof Senate in their campaigns.</p> <p>The Democrats are pushing for 60 as a goal that would allow Obama, if he's elected, to push through sweeping changes on energy, healthcare and foreign policy.</p> <p>The Republicans meanwhile are campaigning on the dangers of unchecked Democratic rule. Their television ads now routinely link Obama to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, and Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, warning of a dangerous liberal triumvirate.</p> <p>\"Liberals are bent on handing Barack Obama a filibuster-proof Senate majority to rubber-stamp his radical agenda,\" Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican warned in a fundraising email.</p> <p>Democrats won a 51-49 majority in the Senate after the 2006 elections. But that did not translate into effective power, under Senate rules that allow the minority party to extend debate and prevent legislation from being put to a vote.</p> <p>The Republicans launched nearly 100 filibusters in the last two years, reducing the Senate to a state of paralysis.</p> <p>Senate Democrats could not even manage to win enough votes to withdraw US forces from Iraq - even though several similar bills easily passed through the House. That could now change, Reid wrote in a recent email to supporters.</p> <p>\"Everything Democrats believe in and fight for is in reach,\" Reid wrote. \"We have a breathtaking opportunity to change America ... We stand at the very brink of electing Barack Obama president and giving him a filibuster-proof majority.\"</p> <p>But solid majorities in Congress are no guarantee that a president will actually win co-operation from his own party - as Jimmy Carter knows. The Democrats won 61 seats in the Senate when Carter was elected in 1976, but he rapidly fell out with his party.</p> <p>Obama, if elected, could also run into resistance from a number of the new crop of Democratic challengers, especially those competing in southern states. A number of the first-time Democratic contenders lean to the right, while some of the Republicans now fighting for their political survival are moderates.</p> <p>\"You are going to have some defections on the Democratic side because these are some conservative Democrats,\" said Rhodes Cook, who runs a respected political newsletter. \"Whoever is elected will be hemmed in by the economy a great deal so that might also be the point that overrides the size of the majority.\"</p> <p>Democrats are hoping to capture a number of important seats in the Senate, including in formerly bedrock Republican regions like the south and Rocky Mountain west.</p> <p>Out of the 35 seats up for election, Republicans are defending 23 and the Democrats just 12. Democrats are leading in all the races they are defending and party leaders say they are confident of winning all 12 seats.</p> <p>But Republicans face tough contests across the map, with Democrats even or ahead in about a dozen seats.</p> <p>By last week, Republican congressional candidates were near open revolt against McCain. John Ensign, the Nevada Republican who is heading the party's Senate election campaign, was describing McCain as a drag on his fellow candidates.</p> <p>\"Our candidates are running ahead of John McCain in almost every place that I mentioned across the country,\" he told a briefing at the National Press Club.</p> <p>The challenges to the Republicans cut across geography as well as ideology. Seats held by retiring senators in Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado are now virtually assured of going Democratic.</p> <p>Party elders even in conservative states are facing a tough time. In North Carolina, Elizabeth Dole, who served in two Republican administrations and ran for the White House herself in 2000, is having to spend her own money to fend off a Democratic challenger.</p> <p>There are also tight contests in Mississippi and Georgia, where a high turnout of African-American voters for Obama in early voting appears to have breathed new life into Democratic Senate challenges once seen as longshots.</p> <p>The fate of Alaska senator Ted Stevens depends how the electorate views the guilty verdict in his trial on corruption charges. The jury found Stevens guilty on seven counts.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/gkn\">GKN</a> warned today that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive\">plummeting demand from the world's carmakers</a> was biting into profits and forcing it to shed jobs in its automotive components businesses.</p> <p>All 1,400 of the company's temporary workers in the sector will be laid off by the end of the year and around three quarters of its 50 plus automotive related factories around the world are bringing in measures to reduce production.</p> <p>The company said its aerospace business was performing strongly and demand at its Offhighway operations, which primarily make parts for agricultural machinery, was still solid. However it warned that \"lead indicators\" for civil aerospace and Offhighway were now \"negative and we expect softening of demand in this markets in 2009.\"</p> <p>A number of carmakers, including several in the UK, have announced plans to curb production and today the German car manufacturer Daimler was reported to be planning to double the Christmas/new year stoppage period at two of its big production venues, Sindelfingen and Untertuerkheim. </p> <p>In the US the Swedish components maker, SKF, said it was moving production of automotive seals in Illinois to other plants in the US and Mexico to maintain competitiveness.</p> <p>Carmakers are scaling back production in response to falling demand as consumers become more cautious about spending on big ticket items and finance becomes harder to get in the wake of the credit crunch.</p> <p>GKN employs around 42,000 people worldwide, including 5,000 in the UK, of which around half work in the automotive components operation.</p> <p>According to GKN, at most, only a handful of workers in Britain will be affected by lay off of temporary staff, though it is unclear if the restructuring of the business will mean further job cuts.</p> <p>Keith Hodgkinson, the GMB officer who represents nearly 1,500 members in GKN at Telford, said: \"GMB has been aware for some time of the precarious situation regarding demands for the automotive products manufactured at Telford. </p> <p>\"We have in place an agreement with the company that members who wish to opt to leave the company via voluntary redundancy are free to do so and over the last few quarters more than 100 workers have taken up this option. </p> <p>\"We are seeking further information from the company following their statement.\"</p> <p>GKN said it was expecting automotive component sales in the fourth quarter to be 15% lower than last year and 20% down on the first half of 2008. The restructuring programme is being drawn up on the basis that automotive components demand in 2009 would be around 8% lower than 2008. </p> <p>The company also warned that it would review its final dividend, with one broker suggesting it could be cut by 5p a share.</p> <p>Overall GKN said group pre-tax profit for both the fourth quarter and the whole of 2008 would be materially below its earlier guidance. The full-year figure was likely to be 20% down on the \u00a3255m for 2007. </p> <p>The company insisted its financial position remains strong. It said it was pressing ahead with the deal to acquire the Airbus wing component manufacturing plant in Filton and expected the acquisition to be completed by January.</p> <p>\"The positives are a proven track record in taking costs out and the benefits of the low cost manufacturing realignment programme of the last four years combined with its market shares,\" said analysts at Evolution Securities.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1 Oregon Senate </strong></p> <p>Hanging on: Gordon Smith (Republican)</p> <p>Smith is considered one of the few Republicans likely to survive this year's wave of anti-incumbent fever among US voters. The reason, according to many analysts, is Smith's decision to openly brag about his friendships with Democrats. Most of his campaign adverts feature a glowing cameo by a famous liberal, from Ted Kennedy to Barack Obama to John Kerry. Smith's opponent, actual Democrat Jeff Merkley, accuses the two-term senator of \"trying to fool\" voters \u2013 but polls show the tactic may be working.</p> <p><strong>2 North Carolina Senate</strong></p> <p>Running scared: Elizabeth Dole (Republican)</p> <p>No one expected that Republican royalty such as Dole, who served in the presidential cabinets of both Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush, would be in danger of losing in the red state of North Carolina. But Barack Obama's powerful organising operation in the south, combined with the no-holds-barred TV commercials run by Democratic challenger Kay Hagan, is giving Dole the shock of her career. Her poll ratings are falling so fast that Dole, the wife of former presidential nominee Bob Dole, recently had to loan personal money to her campaign.</p> <p><strong>3 Minnesota Senate</strong></p> <p>Getting serious: Al Franken (Democrat) </p> <p>Before his entrance into politics, Franken was best-known as a Saturday Night Live comedian. And his campaign was hurt from the start by the lewd jokes Franken left in his wake, as Republican incumbent Norm Coleman attacked him for publishing a satirical essay called Porn-O-Rama. Yet Franken has battled back in recent days, taking advantage of public stumbles by Coleman and an economic meltdown that has heightened public frustration with George Bush's party.</p> <p><strong>4 Mississippi Senate </strong></p> <p>Riding the wave: Ronnie Musgrove (Democrat)</p> <p>This former governor started out the year as the longest of long shots in a state where even Dick Cheney remains ultra-popular. But as Obama's candidacy inspires unprecedented participation by black voters, Musgrove stands to reap the benefits. Mississippi's 39% black population ranks No 1 in the US, meaning that Musgrove only has to hold on to three out of every 10 white voters in order to position himself for victory. The relatively unknown status of his Republican rival, Roger Wicker, doesn't hurt either.</p> <p><strong>5 Florida House of Representatives</strong></p> <p>Scandal-plagued: Tim Mahoney (Democrat)</p> <p>Mahoney promised to be \"more moral\" when he was elected to replace a Republican caught sending sexually explicit online messages to underage boys. But Mahoney's own weakness came back to haunt him this week when a former campaign aide accused him of paying her $121,000 in hush money to hide evidence of their extramarital affair. Mahoney claimed to have broken no laws, but the FBI and the congressional ethics committee are already investigating. With Republican challenger Tom Rooney surging in the polls, some in Washington wonder if Mahoney's seat in Congress is cursed. </p> <p><strong>6 Alaska Senate</strong></p> <p>Found guilty: Ted Stevens (Republican)</p> <p>Could an election in the icy frontier of America have been decided in a Washington courthouse? Stevens, nicknamed Uncle Ted by Alaskans after showering government money on the state for 40 years, was found guilty today of criminally concealing gifts he received from a friendly oil executive. The verdict is considered likely to kill Stevens' chances of overcoming his young Democratic foe, Mark Begich. But the irascible Stevens has defied the odds before, and no one is counting him out next week as his legal team prepares to consider an appeal. </p> <p><strong>7 New Mexico Senate</strong></p> <p>Moving up: Tom Udall (Democrat)</p> <p>Udall and his Colorado brother Mark, both of whom followed their legendary father Mo into Congress, are poised to make the Senate a family affair next year. The brothers are each running strong against their respective Republican opponents, and Tom Udall was confident enough this week to go on the offense on national security - usually the favourite issue of the right wing. Udall's emotional new TV adverts feature a paralysed veteran praising the Democrat for supporting US troops in Iraq. </p> <p><strong>8 Virginia Senate</strong></p> <p>Charging in: Mark Warner (Democrat)</p> <p>The winning name on the ballots in Virginia may be the same, but Mark Warner's replacement of retiring Republican John Warner symbolises a new era in this southern state. Mark Warner was elected governor of Virginia in 2001 as a next-generation Democrat, promising to develop high-tech industry and never raise taxes. Now Obama is following in his path by building a formidable lead in what was once a conservative stronghold, making this southern dominion the next blue state.

  "<p>Lord Mandelson today rejected fresh calls for him to reveal the full extent of his relationship with Oleg Deripaska, insisting that no conflict of interest arose during his meetings with the controversial Russian billionaire.</p> <p>Speaking exclusively to the Guardian at his luxury suite in the Baltschug Kempinski hotel overlooking the Kremlin, the business secretary said he would not clarify how many times he had met the oligarch, or what they discussed.</p> <p>William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday called on Mandelson to say whether he had ever talked about aluminium with Deripaska, whose companies benefited from a lowering of EU tariffs on the metal while Mandelson was EU trade commissioner.</p> <p>But Mandelson, who is leading a four-day UK trade delegation to Russia, refused to confirm the number and nature of his meetings with Deripaska, or the length of time he spent aboard the oligarch's yacht off Corfu in August. </p> <p>\"What is important is not where you meet somebody or how long you meet them for but what you do during the meeting,\" he said. \"In my case, I offered no favours and I received no favours, unlike [shadow chancellor] George Osborne, who was holding conversations around his visits in order to obtain a financial contribution to the Conservative party.\"</p> <p>Osborne has denied soliciting a donation to the Conservative party during his own meeting with Deripaska on the yacht, but today <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/osborne-tories-deripaska-mandelson\">admitted</a> that meeting the oligarch was \"a mistake\".</p> <p>Mandelson admits that before the Corfu meeting he met Deripaska on \"several occasions\" since 2004, but declined to give further details.</p> <p>Deripaska, Russia's richest man, is a controversial tycoon whose visa to the United States was revoked last year, reportedly over suspicions he could be linked to organised crime figures, a claim he rigorously denies. But Lord Mandelson said that meeting business figures from \"across the range\" in emerging economies was part of his brief as EU trade commissioner, a position he gave up earlier this month after his surprise reappointment to the British cabinet. </p> <p>\"You can't hope to do business and promote European interests in those economies unless you are meeting people across the range and in the emerging economies it's very often the business figures who can open the door to European investment and trade,\" he said. \"So, in some cases you will like some more than others, you will meet some more than others, you will make acquaintanceships with some. That doesn't mean to say that a conflict of interest arises. And in this case it didn't.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The European commission, which has examined this matter very thoroughly, confirmed that there was no impropriety arising from any of the meetings I had with Mr Deripaska. That is absolutely crucial and fundamental, not how many times I met him.\"</p> <p>The business secretary is in Moscow to meet British investors and Russian businessmen and is accompanied by a delegation from the Confederation of British Industry, led by its director, Richard Lambert. He will be holding meetings with Alexei Kudrin, the Russian finance minister, representatives of the financial services industry and other business figures.</p> <p>\"Obviously the current financial crisis will set us back in investment flows but trade in goods and services [between Britain and Russia] is growing apace, recently by 25% a year,\" he said. \"That is a remarkable achievement and it is my job to promote it.\"</p> <p>This afternoon Mandelson hailed the signing of a \u00a323m contract between UK-based company JCB and a Russian civil engineering contractor.</p> <p>The business secretary said he hoped his meeting with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, this morning would be a step towards soothing ties between the UK and Russia. Relations have been strained since the murder in London in 2006 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko, and the confrontation between Moscow and the west over the recent war in Georgia.</p> <p>Mandelson said of his visit: \"My impression is that [the Russians] encouraged it and they're glad it's happening and that it is symbolic of a desire on the part of both governments to reduce our differences and smooth our relationship.\"</p> <p>Mandelson's visit is the first by a cabinet minister since early 2007. He is due to leave Moscow on Wednesday. Meanwhile, he is staying in a suite at the Baltschug Kempinski hotel designed by Linley, the company founded by the Queen's nephew, Viscount Linley. The suite is advertised at 177,000 roubles (\u00a34,200) per night.</p>",
  "<p>The police are being given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/27/project-midas-fingerprint-scanner-liberty\">portable fingerprint scanners</a>, \"so that they can check people's identities in the street\". There's no clear explanation offered of what value this is under the current law, where we are entitled to go about our lawful business without identifying ourselves to the police. The police just aren't entitled to \"check your identity\" \u2013 whatever that means. And actually those ministers busily selling the national identity scheme for the past four years have been quick to emphasise that fact \u2013 usually as part of a straw man argument misattributed to people like me.</p> <p>The police do not generally have any difficulty identifying suspects. Their problem is finding evidence to convict a particular person of a crime. (That is where fingerprints do find their way into a minority of criminal cases \u2013 usually as corroboration of other evidence.) Fingerprinting wouldn't be useful if a suspect hadn't already been arrested and fingerprinted, so it could easily be a waste of time.</p> <p>Online matches to large databases also have a significant error rate. It wouldn't be a method of choice. It might be fruitless. It might lead to wrongful arrests. Even conventional fingerprint matching has done that.</p> <p>So what has changed?

Section 117 of the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/ukpga_20050015_en_1\">Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005</a> (the act that banned unlicensed demonstrations within a kilometre of parliament) amended existing legislation in order to expand the powers of police to fingerprint suspects. But it is still necessary that the officer reasonably suspects you of an offence, and that he cannot ascertain your name (by, say, asking you) or has reasonable grounds for thinking you have given a false one. In other words, you can only be forced to give fingerprints for one of these new machines when you could be arrested anyway.</p> <p>Are there a lot of cases where the officer thinks a crime has been committed, thinks the offender is trying to escape by giving a false name, but also thinks arrest is not warranted? There would have to be, to justify kitting out whole forces with these readers. Or should we be worried that people will come under pressure to give their fingerprints as \"a matter of routine\" and failure to do so will be deemed suspicious in itself?</p> <p>Come along, Sir. Nothing to hide, have we?</p> <p>Though the legislation limits the scope of the check, the limits are pretty broad \u2013records held by or on behalf of \"relevant law enforcement authorities\". Could that stretch to cover the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/passports-and-immigration/id-cards/how-the-data-will-be-used/\">National Identity Register</a>? The fingerprints themselves are required to be destroyed \"after they have fulfilled the purpose\" \u2013 but what if the identification sought fails, as it would (or, rather, should) if someone new to police records is checked? And nothing requires the fact of the check to be deleted from the record. Give your fingerprints with any degree of willingness and you will at the very least be tagged as \"suspect\" in some database, perhaps more than one, indefinitely.</p> <p>One thing is plain. History shows we cannot trust the government to constrain unlawful use of a new toy by overzealous forces. In 2000 the courts declared unlawful the standard police practice of hanging on, forever, to DNA records of unconvicted people. No illegal samples were destroyed as a result. Instead the present government changed the law retrospectively to make it all legal after all.</p>",
  "<p>As with so many events that occur at the margins between secretive and controlling Syria and chaotic and violent Iraq, the truth about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/syria-usa\">yesterday's incident</a> may never come out.</p> <p>Instead we are left with interpreting the silence from Washington, gossip from Baghdad and the \"official statements\" from Damascus. The Syrian version claims that four helicopters conducted a night-time raid on a half-built farm near the Euphrates border town of Abu Kamal. At least eight people were killed in what the Syrians describe as a botched raid that killed members of a family \u2013 rather than the likely al-Qaida targets. </p> <p>I visited Abul Kamal in 2006 and found a poor, dusty border market town that had been severely affected by the US military's decision to <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/02/africa/ME-GEN-Syria-Iraq-Border.php\">close the crossing</a> between 2004 and 2007. Speaking to villagers, I found obvious discontent about the severing of their livelihoods \u2013 a decision which was linked to the mortaring of a nearby US marine base at al-Q'aim. As the US had little direct contact with Syria at the time, the marines used a catapult to fire the notice of closure across the border \u2013 a shocking indicator of the poverty of communications between the two states. </p> <p>Yet by closing the main source of revenue for the residents of Abu Kamal and the villages that straddle both the Euphrates and the border line with Iraq, the US was pushing poor Syrians into the arms of rich Gulf jihadists who apparently arrived with suitcases full of cash in order to secure transit into Iraq. This was not an Iraqi version of the \"Ho Chi Minh trail\" used by huge numbers of foreign fighters (as the US claimed in advance of the battles of Fallujah) but small numbers of \"force multipliers\" in the form of would-be suicide attackers. </p> <p>Before the 2003 invasion there was little physical evidence at all of a demarcated border along the largely desert frontier between Syria and Iraq. Over the years and under constant US pressure the Syrians deployed thousands of troops to the border to defend a new sand bearm that would slow the transit of fighters. Back on the border the Syrians introduced <a href=\"http://www.syria-today.com/pkg05/index.php?page=view_article&amp;dir=articles&amp;ex=2&amp;id=286&amp;First=0&amp;Last=7&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;src=search&amp;Keywords=ZGVuc2Vsb3c=&amp;lang=1&amp;Category=\">new checks and visa restrictions</a> for young Arab males and improved their \"eyeballing\" of would-be-fighters. Thousands have been arrested (including Britons) and quietly repatriated to their countries of origin. </p> <p>However, it is important to remember that the border remains and will remain permeable to determined individual transit. The Syrians cannot hope to hermetically seal their frontier any more than the US can seal its border with Mexico. Instead the Syrians have beefed up their presence at the border, changing it from an open desert to a filter of movement. </p> <p>So why this raid now? Any Iraqi government claim on the raid is questionable at best, considering the state of their air force. More likely is that it could be part of a doctrinal shift in US military operations. This would link the raid to what recently occurred in Afghanistan, where US troops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/16/pakistan.afghanistan\">were granted</a> (with tenuous legality) \"hot pursuit\" of enemies into Pakistan. </p> <p>Have the US military decided to claim the right to hot pursuit and get down and dirty in their fight against al-Qaida? Or is this a warning to Syria that its efforts at the border fall short of acceptable? It is certain that US incursions into Syrian territory have occurred in the past; embarrassingly in 2005 Iraqi border guards even violated Syrian territory to steal a British embassy vehicle (returned later minus a pair of binoculars). Or has this raid simply been so botched as to be seized upon as a propaganda victory for a Syrian government that is increasingly basking in the diplomatic thaw of improved international relations? The likelihood is that the desert may never give up all its secrets. </p>",

  "<p>Super keen Phillies fan \"Marty from Delaware\" phoned up a local sports show last week and asked a single plaintive and stupendously ungrammatical question: \"Why can't us?\" \"Why can't us?\" has become the unofficial Phillies fan slogan. Chanted from the bleachers, worn on T-shirts and engraved on the city's heart.</p> <p>If the Phillies win the World Series they'll end Philadelphia's 25-year major professional sports title drought. But don't hold your breath. This is the seventh time a Philly team has come this close since 1983, when the Sixers took the NBA crown. And each time Philadelphia has fallen flat on its ass.</p> <p>Philadelphia fandom is like Charlie Brown; always ready to believe that this time Lucy won't whip away the football at the last moment. This time is it's gonna be different. I haven't met a single Philadelphian who advises caution, who's hedging their bets, who harbours even the thinnest sliver of a smidgeon of a scintilla of doubt that this year a quarter-decade of cross-sports humiliation and hurt ends in a blaze of cathartic glory.</p> <p>The ether is already clogged with YouTubes of super cocky \"Phils phans\" bigging up the \"Phitings\" (pronounced \"fightings\") and smack-talking the shitty Floridian opposition. <a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/?inc=article&amp;id=742&amp;x=phillies-on-philm&amp;_c=\" news--random-act\"\" title=\"\">Philadelphia is positively swaggering with confidence</a>. Same as the last seven times. But what the heck.</p> <p>Dr Joel Fish, director of the Center for Sports Psychology in Philadelphia, reckons that Philadelphian sport fans - possibly the most teeth-gnashingly, shirt-rendingly, hair-tearing-outingly self-pitying sport fans in the world - are <a href=\"http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-10232008-1609885.html\" title=\"\">psychologically ready for the pain to end</a>.</p> <p>I think he's wrong. In his book The Angry Island, AA Gill writes about how winning the World Cup in 1966 secretly horrified the English, who not only treasure losing, but have made it an essential part of their self-image. Philly sports fans have done something similar. If the Phillies win, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7931936\" title=\"\">they are one game from victory</a>, it'll shatter the city's cherished and well-polished self-image of being the most long-sufferingest fans of the losingest teams in the history of sports ever. Philadelphians love that image. They constantly reference it. Make films and plays about it. Nurture it. Polish it. Adore it. In a strip-malled, Wal-Mart-plagued, Starbucks-studded identikit America that becomes blander and more homogenised with ever day that passes, <a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/?inc=vid&amp;id=\" 1391835\"\" title=\"\">Philly's loserishness is an essential part of what keeps the city \"real\"</a>.</p> <p>In The Angry Island AA Gill writes about \"an American [who] pointed out that the English are the only people on Earth who manage to feel schadenfreude about themselves.\" He'd obviously never been to Philadelphia. Other east-coast cities celebrate the great victories of the American Revolution. Every year in Philadelphia they re-enact a defeat - <a href=\"http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/the-battle-of-germantown/11800986/\" title=\"\">the Battle of Germantown</a>, where the insurgent patriots ran away from redcoat bayonets. And don't forget that Rocky - the quintessential Philly hero - loses in the last reel. That what makes him Philly.</p> <p>Like the English, Philly fans have embraced losing. It's an integral part of their very being. It is wrapped around their heart and plugged into their central nervous system like the wee baby beastie in John Hurt's stomach in the first Alien movie. The anti-climax has become the climax. To win means you stop being special and become - in the case of both Philadelphians and the English - some sort of generic rah-rah one-size-fits-all plastic we're No1 American. And who wants that?</p> <p>Philly is one of the friendliest cities on the planet - but it really annoys Philadelphians if you tell them that. They are, after all, the city that hosts the pre-Superbowl tits-out gorge-and-vomit fest known as Wing Bowl; where visiting fans are habitually and ritually abused, soaked with beer and mercilessly hounded; where they once had a special hooligan court in the basement of the old football stadium; where the fans either did or did not throw batteries hidden in snowballs at Santa at an Eagles game, depending on who you talk too and whether that person is interested in pumping up Philly fandom's terrifying hooligan image to frighten outsiders, or deflating it to mock them (both popular local journalistic pastimes).</p> <p>The Phillies winning the World Series would be a bit like Liverpool winning the Premier League. If Liverpool were Millwall. And Millwall had once pelted Santa Claus with ice-balls.</p> <p>I lazily mocked the concept of the \"World\" Series in a recent column. This is one of the responses.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.internationalbaseball.org/guatemala.htm\" title=\"\">Guatemala doesn't play baseball</a> you dumb Limey cuntstick.</p> <p>Do your homework next time, or better yet, just get cancer (again) and die.\"</p> <p>That's wonderfully Philly. When football teams with a somewhat more bourgeois fan-base visit Philadelphia and stories emerge of their shock and horror at the rough treatment these decent burghers receive at the hands of spitting, cursing, \"asshole\" chanting, horny-handed Philadelphian beer monsters, there's no loss of civic pride, no soul-searching, no editorials demanding that something be done to rescue the city from the gutter of fan infamy. Godammit, Philadelphia loves the fact that folks in the Dallas suburbs think we're a buncha demented berserker hooligans. This is the second crucial leg of Philly fandom's self-image. We lose. And our fans are realer, rougher and more authentic than yours could ever be. But take away one of those legs ...</p> <p>If the Phillies win the city will go mental. There will be joy in the streets. It'll be like Luton on a Friday night. Cars will be overturned and teenage girls in pink official MLB merchandise will be arrested for punching cops. It'll be great. But in the weeks and months and years that follow, as it ever so slowly sinks into the city's cultural subconscious that \"Oh my God, we won, we actually won\", Philadelphians will slowly start to realise exactly how much they've lost.</p>",
  "<p>Carbon pollution levels are rising so fast that the world has no realistic chance of hitting ambitious climate targets set by Britain and the G8, an influential report to the Australian government has warned. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.garnautreview.org.au/domino/Web_Notes/Garnaut/garnautweb.nsf\">report, from economist Ross Garnaut</a>, says existing carbon goals, such as those in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/16/greenpolitics-edmiliband\">Britain's climate change bill</a>, are based on out-of-date emissions figures, and are so ambitious that they could wreck attempts to agree a new global deal on global warming. </p> <p>Garnaut says that nations must accept a greater amount of warming is inevitable, or risk a failure to agree that \"would haunt humanity until the end of time.\"</p> <p>The report, billed as the Australian Stern review, uses recent estimates of booming carbon emissions that were not included in last year's report of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ipcc\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC), or the 2006 report from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/30/economy.uk\">Sir Nicholas Stern</a> on the economics of the problem. </p> <p>Since 2000, the Garnaut report says, global carbon emissions from fossil fuel use have grown by 3% each year, as economies of developing countries including China have boomed. This compares to annual growth rates of 2% through the 1970s and 1980s, and just 1% in the 1990s.</p> <p>The report, published today, predicts that carbon dioxide emissions will continue to rise by more than 3% each year until 2030.</p> <p>The worst case considered by the IPCC was that world carbon dioxide emissions would rise by 2.5% each year \u2014 a scenario often criticised as too pessimistic. Most government projections and discussions are based on the milder IPCC \"median\" scenario, which sets an annual growth rate of just 2%.</p> <p>Garnaut says the recent spike in emissions reflects a \"platinum age\" for the world economy, with growth exceeding the \"golden age\" of the 1950s and 1960s. And he says the trend raises \"serious questions\" about suggested climate targets.</p> <p>Britain and Europe are pushing for the world to agree to limit carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to 450 parts per million (ppm), which they say could avoid dangerous climate change. The level is currently more than 380ppm, up from 280ppm before the industrial revolution, and rising by more than 2ppm each year. </p> <p>The framework for such an agreement was established at UN negotiations in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bali\">Bali</a> last year, and will be discussed in Poland this December. Analysts say a new treaty must be agreed at a meeting in Copenhagen, late next year, for it to enter into force in 2012, when the existing Kyoto protocol expires.</p> <p>The Garnaut report says developed nations including Britain, the United States and Australia would have to slash carbon dioxide emissions by 5% each year over the next decade to hit the 450ppm target. Britain's climate change bill, the most ambitious of its kind in the world, calls for reductions of about 3% each year to 2050.</p> <p>Garnaut, a professorial fellow in economics at Melbourne University, said: \"Achieving the objective of 450ppm would require tighter constraints on emissions than now seem likely in the period to 2020 ... The only alternative would be to impose even tighter constraints on developing countries from 2013, and that does not appear to be realistic at this time.\"</p> <p>The report adds: \"The awful arithmetic means that exclusively focusing on a 450ppm outcome, at this moment, could end up providing another reason for not reaching an international agreement to reduce emissions. In the meantime, the cost of excessive focus on an unlikely goal could consign to history any opportunity to lock in an agreement for stabilising at 550ppm, a more modest, but still difficult, international outcome. An effective agreement around 550ppm would be vastly superior to continuation of business as usual.\"</p> <p>Experts say that a 450ppm goal could limit temperature rise to 2C, while 550ppm would commit the world to 3C warming, which the IPCC warned would inflict drought and famine on hundreds of millions of people and devastate wildlife.</p> <p>Friends of the Earth said: \"A target of 550ppm of carbon dioxide is a recipe for disaster and even the lower target of 450ppm will mean we will face runaway climate change. The Arctic sea ice and Himalaya glaciers are already disappearing and the permafrost bomb is looming. We need much deeper cuts. Professor Garnaut has described strong targets as delusional, but he continues to feed a delusional policy debate that recognises the problem but doesn't want to implement the solution.\"</p> <p>The report, which was released by the Australian government last month, comes after climate scientists criticised carbon targets as having no scientific basis and potentially leading to \"dangerously misguided\" policies. </p> <p>Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows at the Tyndall centre for climate change research at Manchester University <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/01/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange2\">say global carbon emissions are rising so fast</a> that they would need to peak by 2015 and then decrease by up to 6.5% each year for atmospheric CO2 levels to stabilise at 450ppm, which might limit temperature rise to 2C.

  "<p>A university building in Milan, designed by Irish practice Grafton Architects, has scooped the top prize at the inaugural World Architecture Festival awards, beating architectural heavyweights Zaha Hadid and Foster and Partners.</p> <p>The new faculty building at Luigi Bocconi University, Milan, was selected from a total of 17 finalists, whittled down from 224 projects presented at the World Architecture Festival in Barcelona last week.</p> <p>The judging panel, headed by Lord Norman Foster and architectural practitioners from around the world, praised the building - which includes suspended offices, a 1,000-seat auditorium, lecture theatres, public courtyards and a subterranean concourse - for its \"3D design\" and \"effortless structural solution\".</p> <p>Paul Finch, WAF programme director and editor of the Architectural Review, said at the awards: \"Our congratulations go to Grafton Architects. The winning building has a heavy relationship with the landscape of Milan and has the capacity to make a profound difference to the lives of its users. Grafton Architects have opened up the past of the city with a 21st-century attitude.\"</p> <p>The directors of the Dublin-based practice, Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara, were delighted by the accolade: \"This is the biggest project we have ever undertaken. We were trying to make the university a miniature city where public realm connects with the rest of the city and the campus provides a window to Milan. Being in the city for six years we have grown to love this project, which has changed our lives. A wonderful client, place and ambition all contribute to good architecture, and we had all three.\"</p> <p>The global architecture award compares and contrasts buildings completed in the past 18 months. A diverse list of projects competes in a range of categories, from a fire station in Mexico to the O2 Arena in Greenwich, London. Foster and Partners won the \"new and old\" award for the Arlene Kogod Courtyard at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, and Zaha Hadid was awarded the top prize in the transport category for the Nord Park Cable Railway in Innsbruck, Austria, but it was the Irish design that most impressed the judges.</p> <p>\u2022 More about the <a href=\"http://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/\">World Architecture Festival Awards</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama </a>is taking the fight to states won by George Bush in a bid to open a wide path to the White House and keep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> on the defensive in the final week of the presidential campaign.</p> <p>The Democratic presidential hopeful will campaign in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia\">Virginia</a>, while his wife, Michelle, heads to Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, three western states Bush won but the Democrats are likely to take in November.</p> <p>In Canton, Ohio, Obama today will make what aides describe as a closing argument for his two-year campaign. He is expected to continue pressing the case that McCain will continue Bush's politics. McCain has acknowledged that he and Bush share \"a common philosophy of the Republican party\".</p> <p>\"In one week, you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election; that tries to pit region against region, city against town, Republican against Democrat; that asks us to fear at a time when we need hope,\" Obama will say, according to excerpts released by the campaign.</p> <p>\"After 21 months and three debates, Senator McCain still has not been able to tell the American people a single major thing he'd do differently from George Bush when it comes to the economy. Senator McCain says that we can't spend the next four years waiting for our luck to change, but you understand that the biggest gamble we can take is embracing the same old Bush-McCain policies that have failed us for the last eight years.\"</p> <p>In a reprise of Ronald Reagan's famous line from a 1980 debate, Obama will say: \"The question in this election is not 'Are you better off than you were four years ago?' We know the answer to that. The real question is, 'Will this country be better off four years from now?'\"</p> <p>McCain is concentrating on Pennsylvania, which has not voted Republican since 1988. Hillary Clinton defeated Obama there in the spring primary by 10 percentage points. After a rally in Ohio this afternoon, McCain returns to Pennsylvania for an event in Pottsville, central Pennsylvania, where McCain hopes to pick up enough culturally conservative, older whites to counter Obama's support in the cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Polls show Obama leading in the state by about 10 percentage points.</p> <p>The Republican campaign has sent McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, to defend Virginia, where she will hold two rallies. Virginia has not voted for a Democrat since 1964, but a Washington Post/ABC News poll this morning showed Obama leading McCain 52% to 44%.</p>",
  "<p>Trainer form matters at any time but it's especially important at the fag end of the Flat turf season. All three of today's tips at Leicester come from yards that have been firing in the winners recently - those of Bryan Smart, Pat Eddery and John Gosden.</p> <p>Smart's strike-rate in nurseries is about the same as his overall strike-rate but he makes a level-stakes profit in such races and <strong>Postman (2.00)</strong> is probably still over-priced at 6-1, having shortened from double-figure odds overnight.</p> <p>This one hardly jumps off the page - he was tailed off when last seen at Ascot in August. Still, you have to be careful about writing a horse off after a poor effort on his third start in maiden races and I'm sure there is better to come, now that Postman's in handicaps. Ted Durcan takes over from Tom Eaves in the saddle, a first-time visor is applied and Postman can be fairly expected to go close for the first time since his debut.</p> <p>Eddery's <strong>Stand In Flames (3.00)</strong> looks the banker on the card, having won a similar claimer at Windsor last time. If anything, the step back up to seven furlongs should help, as she's not the speediest, and the 6-4 is fair.</p> <p>Gosden has returned a net profit to level-stakes for the last three months and, of course, enjoyed the best day of his career with a Breeders' Cup double on Saturday. I guess victory in a mile handicap at Leicester on the following Monday is unlikely to please him in quite the same way but his <strong>Charm School (3.30) </strong>has solid credentials on his second handicap outing. He had no luck in running when stuffed on Lingfield's Polytrack last time.</p> <p>Of course, the phrase \"no luck in running\" comes up a lot in association with Lingfield, where every finish comes with heartbreak guaranteed. And still Talking Horses continues to look there for winners, like a whale that keeps beaching itself.</p> <p><strong>War Of The Roses (3.20)</strong> has four wins and five seconds from 10 starts on the Polytrack round here, making him exactly the kind of horse we want on our side. And yet, he seems very unfashionable - he was 14-1 when he scored here last month and 11-2 when narrowly beaten last time. Just 2lb higher, he's 9-2 this afternoon and I'm sure that underestimates him again.</p> <p>The favourite is Falcativ, who won on Polytrack last time but at Kempton, which bends the other way. I generally find that the form doesn't translate too well between Kempton and Lingfield and, at 7-4, I'm happy to take this one on.</p> <p>I'm more worried about Mutamaasek, another course specialist, now looking for his sixth win here. He's having his first start since February and has always needed a run or two in the past but Lady Herries can get them ready.</p> <p><strong>1.55pm One to keep in mind</strong></p> <p>I quite fancied City For Conquest in the opener at Lingfield, but didn't mention it here, having been put off by Stacy Renwick in the saddle. Ms Renwick hasn't had a winner on the all-weather all year and has only had five spins round Lingfield in the last five years. This is a course that takes some knowing - but you'd have thought she could still do better than the performance she just turned in. As they lined up for home with just two furlongs left, she had this 15-2 shot stone last, on the outside. Of course, the mare ran on strongly into third, having not had a race up to that point, but was never going to catch the leaders. Hopefully the stewards will have a word with this rider. City For Conquest is handicapped to win round here and will be worth a good look when someone else gets the leg-up.</p> <p><strong>2.30pm Postman not exactly knocking on the door</strong></p> <p>Maybe Postman is, in fact, only as good as that Ascot flop. Despite the visor, he started slowly and then ran green, finding nil at the business end and finishing towards the back.</p> <p>Hi Hoover1403. M'colleague David Myers reports sighting a copy of Racing Ahead Weekend on a garage forecourt in Essex on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>3.05pm Dean McKeown beats the day's good thing</strong></p> <p>Shane Kelly made plenty of use of Stand In Flames, who looked in need of the winning post fully two furlongs out. And who should come by in the closing stages if not Dean McKeown, riding Dancing Maite. Wait a minute . . . wasn't McKeown warned off for four years just last week? Well, yes he was, having been found to have been part of a corrupt conspiracy that made a \u00a361,000 profit from laying horses some years ago. McKeown has until Thursday to lodge an appeal against the finding, made by racing's ruling body. In the meantime, he can continue to ride - which turns out to be a pity for Talking Horses.</p> <p><strong>3.25pm Lingfield. Heartbreak. Guaranteed.</strong></p> <p>It was looking good for most of the race there as War Of The Roses cruised through the field, with Jamie Spencer pushing the ears off Falcativ out the back. When the tip went clear in the straight, he traded at 1-3, having started at an SP of 5-1. Alas, Falcativ ran on strongly and got there in time. It's another fine run here by War Of The Roses but Falcativ is going to be hard to oppose on Polytrack next time, as he can hardly go up much in the weights - this was a narrow win but a fine performance.</p> <p><strong>4.30pm Charm offensive</strong></p> <p>Charm School ran respectably to be third at Leicester but the gambled-on Axiom appeared to have plenty in hand. This was the day for Luca Cumani's winner, hammered into an SP of 11-4 after opening at 8-1 on Betfair last night.

  "<p>A new global deal on climate change will come too late to save most of the world's coral reefs, according to a US study that suggests major ecological damage to the oceans is now inevitable.</p> <p>Emissions of carbon dioxide are making seawater so acidic that reefs including the Great Barrier Reef off Australia could begin to break up within a few decades, research by the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University in California suggests. Even ambitious targets to stabilise greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, as championed by Britain and Europe to stave off dangerous climate change, still place more than 90% of coral reefs in jeopardy.</p> <p>Oceanographers Long Cao and Ken Caldeira looked at how carbon dioxide dissolves in the sea as human emissions increase. About a third of carbon pollution is soaked up in this way, where it reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid. Experts say human activity over the last two centuries has produced enough acid to lower the average pH of global ocean surface waters by about 0.1 units.</p> <p>Such acidification spells problems for coral reefs, which rely on calcium minerals called aragonite to build and maintain their exoskeletons.</p> <p>\"We can't say for sure that [the reefs] will disappear but ... the likelihood they will be able to persist is pretty small,\" said Caldeira.</p> <p>The new study was prompted by questions by a US congressional committee on how possible carbon stabilisation targets would affect coral loss.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen from 280 parts per million (ppm) before the industrial revolution to more than 380ppm now. Campaigners and politicians in Europe and the UK say a new global climate deal, which is expected to be agreed next year, must aim to limit CO2 to 450ppm, though scientists say that is unlikely and the world is heading for 550ppm or even 650ppm.</p> <p>The research suggests that stabilising world carbon levels at 450ppm would still dump so much carbon dioxide in the oceans that only 8% of coral reefs would be surrounded by water with enough aragonite to maintain their structure. Some 7% of the ocean below 60 degrees south will see a shortage of aragonite, while parts of the high latitude ocean could see a pH drop of 0.2 units.</p> <p>At 550ppm CO2 in the atmosphere, no coral reef would have access to enough of the mineral. Even stabilising CO2 at current levels would still leave some 60% of coral bathed in seawater with low aragonite levels.</p> <p>The increased amounts of carbon dioxide going into the ocean will also affect other marine life, such as shellfish, that need the calcium mineral to build carbonate shells. </p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/journals/gl/\">Geophysical Research Letters</a>, the scientists say the risk posed by carbon pollution to coral and marine life could justify a carbon stabilisation goal \"lower than what might be chosen based on climate considerations alone\". </p> <p>The UK's Royal Society is preparing to issue a warning to policymakers on the issue, together with dozens of other international science academies.</p> <p>Caldeira said the affected reefs would not disappear straight away, but that the change in water chemistry would leave them vulnerable to attack, bleaching or disease. </p> <p>He said: \"We're losing the Arctic ice, it looks like we're going to lose the coral reefs and we could lose much of the rainforest. I find it disconcerting that these ecosystems that have been around on Earth for a long, long time are no longer able to survive.\"</p>",
  "<p>As this long, long election campaign enters its final full week, John McCain faces an important choice, writes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/john-mccain-republicans-us-election\">Ewen MacAskill in the Guardian today</a>: accept the strong possibility that he's going to lose, and seek to be remembered as having fought to a dignified finish ... or throw everything he can at Obama in an all-out attempt to win. Publicly, of course, McCain won't admit the likelihood of defeat; yesterday he predicted a \"late night\" on November 4 - in which he would emerge triumphant - and spent the weekend painting Barack Obama as making a premature victory lap. (Sarah Palin's speeches on Saturday and Sunday echoed the theme.) \"This has been a very close race, and I believe I will win it,\" McCain said, seizing on a Reuters/Zogby poll that put him only five points behind Obama. But the centrepiece of McCain's weekend attack on Obama's presumptuousness faltered. The Republican accused his rival of having already written an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/27/us-election-transition-plans\">inauguration speech</a>, but turned out to be talking about a book chapter written by John Podesta - who heads Obama's transition team now, but who wrote it when he was still advising Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>In terms of the electoral map, McCain is now concentrating his money and time on <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/article/20081026/NEWS07/810260377\">Pennsyvlania</a>, in the hope that bringing home its 21 electoral college votes - which haven't gone to a Republican since 1988 - could offset potential losses in states such as Virginia. It will be a seriously uphill battle: polls give Obama a double-digit lead there. (Nate Silver, of the electoral projections blog FiveThirtyEight.com, suggests an alternative strategy <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/mccains-10-day-plan.html\">here</a>.) And if some conservatives get their way, he will have even fewer resources with which to wage it: yesterday one influential voice, the former Bush speechwriter <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/23/AR2008102302081.html?hpid=opinionsbox1?callitaweasel\">David Frum</a>, argued that it's now in Republican interests to cut McCain loose, switching every last dollar to Senate races in order to build a base from which the party can begin a post-election recovery.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Both Obama and McCain are in Ohio then Pennsylvania today. At a speech in Ohio at 12.30pm eastern time, Obama will lay out his \"closing argument\": according to his campaign, he'll tell voters \"that after 21 months and three debates, Senator McCain still has not been able to tell the American people a single major thing he'd do differently from George Bush when it comes to the economy\".</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>That Reuters/Zogby poll notwithstanding, Obama seems to be maintaining his solid lead: an ABC/Washington Post poll puts the race at 52% to 45% among likely voters, while Gallup and Rasmussen tracking polls put it at 52%-43% and 52%-44%, a slight improvement for Obama and no change respectively.</p> <h2>Quotes of the weekend</h2> <p>\"If you're voting for the other guy, you should just wait until November 5.\" Barack Obama, speaking in Colorado, tries his hand at voter suppression. \"I'm just teasing,\" he added swiftly.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama and I both have spent quite some time on the basketball court.

  "<p>A missile believed to have been fired from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa\">US</a> drone aircraft has killed up to 20 people in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a>'s South Waziristan border region, Pakistani officials said today.</p> <p>The strike targeted a house belonging to an aide to a local Taliban leader in what is thought to be a stronghold of Taliban and al-Qaida forces. </p> <p>Up to 20 bodies were found at the scene, intelligence officials, quoting local sources, said.</p> <p>The AFP news agency quoted other officials in the region as saying that 16 people had been killed. The report said Haji Omar Khan, an aide to the local Taliban leader, Jalaluddin Haqqani, was among the dead.</p> <p>There was no independent verification of the casualties, and US officials did not confirm any attack. </p> <p>Drones operated by the US military and the CIA regularly patrol the skies above the largely lawless regions of Pakistan that border Afghanistan. </p> <p>They have carried out more than a dozen reported missile strikes in the past few months, killing at least two senior al-Qaida officials but putting an increasing strain on Pakistan's relations with Washington.</p> <p>Pakistan still officially supports US-led efforts to hunt down al-Qaida and Taliban forces.</p> <p>However, since Pervez Musharraf, a staunch US ally, stepped down as the president of Pakistan in August, the country's new leaders have increasingly complained about drone-launched attacks.</p> <p>Tensions have increased further with a series of US helicopter raids into Pakistani territory from Afghanistan, which Pakistani leaders have condemned as a violation of the country's sovereignty.</p> <p>In response, US commanders have alleged that Pakistani forces are not putting enough pressure on militant strongholds on their territory.</p> <p>Afghanistan's US-backed president, Hamid Karzai, has repeatedly accused Pakistan of secretly helping militants as a way to exert influence over its neighbour.</p> <p>Yesterday, the New York Times reported that the US military had abandoned the use of helicopter-carried commando raids across the border into Pakistan.</p> <p>The decision followed a raid on September 3 in which more than 20 people, some of them civilians, were killed, sparking a furious response from the Pakistani government.</p> <p>US commanders have instead increased the frequency of missile strikes. There have been at least 18 such attacks since the start of August compared with five during the rest of 2008, the New York Times said.</p> <p>Tribal leaders from Afghanistan and Pakistan were meeting in Islamabad today to try to find ways to end militant violence. </p> <p>The Jirgagai, or mini-jirga, follows up on a bigger assembly in Kabul last year, and is likely to recommend the idea of talks with the Taliban, Reuters reported.</p> <p>Also today, a car bomb explosion in the western Pakistani city of Quetta killed two people.</p> <p>The bomb went off near government offices and the Iranian consulate, a police official said, adding that 10 other people had been injured.</p>",
  "<h2>Richard Dadd - The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke (1855-1864)</h2> <p>The only painting of fairies that's truly convincing? While incarcerated in Bedlam after murdering his father, Dadd spent nine years working on this spellbinding image. And it's not just down to the fairies. Dadd's minuscule attention to natural detail makes this a work of crazed wonderment. (RC)</p> <h2>Salvador Dal\u00ed - Illumined Pleasures (1929), The Persistence of Memory (1931), Autumnal Cannibalism (1937)</h2> <p>As the master of deliberately shocking soundbites, extraordinary moustaches and ceaseless merchandise, Dal\u00ed has been overexposed, and the disarmingly radical early paintings are often forgotten. Yet forget Dal\u00ed the showman and glance again over Illumined Pleasures, with its dream logic spilling over an arid landscape. Narrative, sequence, time, order, rationality: none of these applies here, in what Dal\u00ed called his \"hand-painted dream photographs\". His finest early paintings appear to crack the subconscious open, revealing it to be as messy as you might imagine. In The Persistence of Memory, time melts and the key distinctions between here and now, past and present, disintegrate. Autumnal Cannibalism shows how Dal\u00ed's work changed in the shadow of the Spanish civil war: a couple gorge on one another, their twisted, ghastly bodies \u2014 like all of Dal\u00ed's best paintings \u2014 a disquieting eruption. (EM)</p> <h2>Danwon - Album of Scenes from Daily Life (c1800)</h2> <p>One of the most famous painters of the Korean Choson period, Danwon had a talent for capturing the vagaries of everyday life with a benign humour and a light touch. This album illustrates scenes from school and other daily activities. (JL)</p> <h2>Honor\u00e9 Daumier - Don Quixote and Sancho Panza (c1855)</h2> <p>The would-be knight errant and his earthy-minded servant are just smears of melancholy paint in a barren wasteland in Daumier's paintings illustrating Cervantes' 17th-century novel. Other artists including Picasso and Dal\u00ed have been inspired by Don Quixote, but Daumier's vision of the book is the strangest and starkest. (JJ)</p> <h2>Jacques-Louis David - The Oath of the Horatii (1785), The Death of Marat (1793), Marie Antoinette Led to Her Execution (1793)</h2> <p>Three brothers swear an oath to die for the Republic in David's forbidding scene from Roman history. Just to the left of the picture's centre is a starbust of straight lines composed of saluting arms and the three swords proffered by the men's father, creating a terrible jagged explosion of energy that contrasts with the calm architectural setting. It's a man thing: the women of the family weep and swoon at the right of the picture. David's reverence for history is there again, undimmed by violent experience, in his portrait of the dead Marat, martyred \u2014 in the artist's eyes \u2014 for his unbending revolutionary courage. David was an active proponent of the French Revolution who voted to execute Marie Antoinette then drew her, with what looks like compassion, in the tumbril. (JJ)</p> <h2>Tacita Dean - T&amp;I (2006), Crowhurst II (2007)</h2> <p>A silver burst of sun pours like acid into an etched sky in Tacita Dean's vast picture T&amp;I, composed of 25 separate plates made with an old-fashioned technique called photogravure, which turns a photograph into something painterly. Over the vast total image of a shoreline on a dark day she has chalked fragments of a mysterious narrative. Dean is a British romantic with a melancholy grandeur of vision; in Crowhurst II a graveyard tree looms isolated in snowy whiteness, an ancient mariner with a tale to tell. (JJ)</p> <h2>Edgar Degas - Princess Pauline de Metternich (1865), Absinthe (1876), Little Dancer Aged 14 (1880-1881) H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rouart in her Father's Study (c1886) Woman Having Her Hair Combed (c1886), Blue Dancers (1893)</h2> <p>Degas is the most misunderstood of all the artists who became controversial and then rich in 19th-century Paris under the nickname of impressionism. For one thing, the word \"impressionist\" hardly ever seems to have been an accurate description of him. Refined, solitary and strange, he was not in the least interested in spontaneity or capturing the moment, and when he did paint a beach scene he staged it in the studio. What did fascinate him was photography. His portrait of Pauline de Metternich is not done from life but from a photograph \u2014 Degas gives her face a grey hue and exquisitely<br>reproduces the look of a blurred 19th century camera image. This is a century before Warhol. But it would be no more adequate to reduce Degas to a photographic artist than it is to see him as a soppy painter of ballet dancers. He is a unique mixture of coolness and intensity, superb formal ability and awkward daring. What does make Degas an impressionist is his sensual shock at the world's cheap everyday beauty. He can walk into a bar, see a woman drinking absinthe, feel sorry for her \u2014 but then, painting the scene later (or making it up), fall in love with how the lemon-juice colour of the drink dances off the coarse yellow stuff of her shirt. No one had noticed things like this for centuries \u2014 simple real colours and shapes. The realism of 17th century art had given away to endless idealised abstractions \u2014 the revolution in art in 19th century Paris was quite simply one of seeing freshly. Degas sees with formidable concentration and frames his eye's treasures in opulent, velvety settings flashed with chromatic ecstasy. (JJ)</p> <h2>Willem de Kooning - Composition (1955), Rosy-Fingered Dawn at Louse Point (1963), Woman, Say Harbour (1964)</h2> <p>Willem de Kooning was a painter's painter. He knew exactly how to push and pull the oil around the canvas so the surface happenings appear to have been bred by an act of nature. Shifting sporadically in these three paintings between abstract and figurative (which previously had been considered mutually exclusive in the work of any one artist), shifting also between urban and organic gestures, his imagery seems always to have been caught at its point of most dynamic vitality. This visceral spontaneity is deceptive, of course. The reason so many painters idolised this man is that they tried to do what he did and failed miserably. Catching a peripheral glimpse of a de Kooning when walking in a gallery is like being shocked into alertness by some unexpected and unprecedented living presence. (RC)</p> <h2>Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - The Death of Sardanapalus (1827), Liberty Leading the People (1830), Women of Algiers (1834)</h2> <p>Delacroix bombards you with the noise of revolutionary gunfire in his monument to French political passions, Liberty Leading the People, with its unforgettable outline of the street boy raising his pistol against golden glowing smoke that enfolds Notre Dame itself. Excess is even more apparent in his stupendous epic of decadence, portraying the effete king Sardanapalus drowning in a vast bed of fleshy pink. Yet beneath the crash of cannonades he is an exquisitely subtle colourist. There is no painting in the world whose chromatic poetry haunts the mind more than his Women of Algiers. There's a beguiling magic to the way fierce reds, golds and blacks are cooled by the shadows of this tranquil harem scene. Delacroix is a great liberator \u2014 he unlocked the cage and let out French modern art's wild beasts. (JJ)</p> <h2>Robert Delaunay - Simultaneous Contrasts: Sun and Moon (1913)</h2> <p>The moon is a pale eye isolated by violet mist from the sun's flowers and flames in this painting that at first appears totally abstract, but is actually a symbolic meeting of day and night, flesh and spirit. (JJ)</p> <h2>Jeremy Deller - The Battle of Orgreave Archive (2004)</h2> <p>Deller's brand of high conceptualism and folk art is expressed in a re-enactment of the notorious clash between striking miners and the police at the Orgreave coking plant near Rotherham. It's as if members of the Sealed Knot had switched their civil war outfits for policemen's uniforms circa 1984. (AH)</p> <h2>Walter de Maria - The Lightning Field (1977)</h2> <p>Four hundred steel rods have been driven into a remote part of the New Mexico desert, in a grid measuring a kilometre square. This spectacular piece of land art reveals itself most fully at dusk, dawn \u2014 and especially during an electric storm. (CH)</p> <h2>Cathy de Monchaux - Wandering About in the Future, Looking Forward to the Past (1994)</h2> <p>A vertical sentinel is reminiscent of the sculptor's recurrent vaginal zips. Flanking it in maddening symmetry are two beribboned glass screens, their transparency shrouded with white. An enticing threshold to God knows what. (RC)</p> <h2>Andr\u00e9 Derain - London Bridge (1906)</h2> <p>Lemon light freckles the lime-green surface of the Thames; the blue facades of City banks float beneath a red sky. Derain's masterpiece of fauvism unleashes colour's expressive energy on Edwardian London. (JJ)</p> <h2>Giorgio di Chirico - The Nostalgia of the Infinite (c1912-1913), Premonitory Portrait of Apollinaire (1914)</h2> <p>Italy does actually look at times like di Chirico's desolate dreamscapes of empty piazzas on sun-deadened afternoons. Long perspective vistas, classical architecture and fragments of statuary make it explicit that di Chirico paints in a land haunted by its past. He acknowledges the archaisms the futurist movement wanted to eradicate, in the most profound Italian art of the 20th century, which influenced the surrealists but in truth surpasses them. He was a seer: his portrait of Apollinaire seemed to the Paris avant garde to uncannily predict the wound that would lead to this modernist hero's<br>death. (JJ)</p> <h2>Otto Dix - Die Skatspieler (1920)</h2> <p>Disfigured amputee war veterans play a traditional German card game. One man holds his cards between the toes of a solitary limb, another has a steel jaw in this vicious report on life in Weimar Germany. (JJ)</p> <h2>Peter Doig - 100 Years Ago (2001)</h2> <p>Born in Edinburgh, brought up in Canada, resident in Trinidad, Doig was the subject of a deserved mid-career retrospective at Tate Britain earlier this year. His work is exhilarating and mesmerising. We never quite know what we're looking at. In this painting a solitary bearded man is staring at us from his canoe \u2014 is he scared or scaring, coming or going? (MB)</p> <h2>Donatello - St George (c1415-1417), David (c1446-1460), Judith and Holofernes (c1446-1460)</h2> <p>Donatello's art has savage force and strength. It's inevitable that most people will encounter him while trying to understand the Renaissance \u2014 he was one of the first artists to study the ruins of ancient Rome, he created in his sensuous bronze David the first great nude in European art since classical times, and almost all his major works remain in Florence. But please don't be put off by his centrality to the great tradition. Look at his tremendous figure of St George \u2014 what formidable concentrated power there is in this vision of the perfect knight, protecting his people, poised in armour with his tall shield and his face full of keenness and energy. Where is the Renaissance here? In the proportions of the figure, the knowledge of anatomy, the determination to represent a human being as if he could think and feel. His strangest work of all, Judith and Holofernes, is as jagged and cruel as anything the Aztecs were simultaneously creating. Judith stands as if in a trance, raising a terrifying<br>curved sword over her head to bring it down, like a peasant reaping, and strike off the hairy head of Holofernes that she holds as roughly as she might lug a sack. All this is cast in bronze, including the cushion the drunk Holofernes slumps on and Judith's enveloping cowl \u2014 it is spine-tingling. (JJ)</p> <h2>Gustave Dor\u00e9 - Illustrations for The Divine Comedy (1857)</h2> <p>Gustave Dor\u00e9 was chiefly an engraver, best known for his gothic illustrations of literary works by Milton, Balzac and Edgar Allan Poe. But it was his malevolent interpretation of Dante's Divine Comedy that work, in particular his visions of hell. (JL)</p> <h2>Duccio - Maest\u00e0 (1308-1311)</h2> <p>Angels peer inquisitively over the back of Mary's throne like peasants peeking in the window to see a newborn, and the court of heaven chats happily, at the heart of an altarpiece that glows with sensitive humanity. (JJ)</p> <h2>Marcel Duchamp - Bicycle Wheel (1913), In Advance of the Broken Arm (1915), The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even or The Large Glass (1915-1923), Fountain (1917), LHOOQ (1919), The Green Box (1934), Box in a Valise (c1943), Etant Donn\u00e9es (1946-1966)</h2> <p>The idea that an artist can just select an ordinary object from the world and, without adding anything very much or altering it in any significant way, simply call it art is one of the strangest and most outrageous ever dreamed up. It no longer seems absurd, as its consequences continue to ramify, to say that Marcel Duchamp's invention of the readymade was as startling an intellectual innovation as the contemporary intellectual breakthroughs of Freud and Einstein. </p> <p>Those who would seek to diminish Duchamp \u2014 to argue that he was essentially a minor talent who found an ingenious way to disguise<br>the fact, which has proved appealing to many a minor talent since \u2014 must come to terms with the sheer originality of his thought. Few ideas in art are really new \u2014 it is almost always possible to show that someone somewhere anticipated this method of perspective or that way of painting light. But who ever dreamed, before Duchamp, that you could just \"choose\" something as art, as he put it in defending his pseudonymous submission of a porcelain urinal (Fountain) to a New York art exhibition in 1917? </p> <p>It's not just that Duchamp's readymades are unlikely art objects. They shun all the potential ways in which such objects might be accepted as art. In choosing his objects Duchamp carefully avoided any of the visual analogies that Picasso, for instance, exploits in his sculpture of a bull's head made by fixing handlebars onto a bike seat; in fact he rigorously excludes atmosphere and poetry. Duchamp's snow shovel inscribed In Advance of the Broken Arm is characterless \u2014 if this dull thing is art, what is art? It is by being so prosaic that Duchamp's objects pose their philosophical question. </p> <p>The other reason only a fool would dismiss Duchamp and his influence is that, while he conducted his readymade revolution, he simultaneously worked on a complex narrative picture with roots deep in the Renaissance. Out of studies of the science of pictorial perspective Duchamp created a virtual universe in which the only reality is erotic desire. Eroticism \u2014 frankly, masturbation \u2014 fuels the cosmic machine of the Large Glass, in which male or rather \"malic\" figures in the lower glass panel try to project their fantasies upward to reach the Bride, a robotic insect suspended from a cloud. </p> <p>All western art's high aspirations are reduced to mechanical sexuality; the bachelors' longing to ascend and the vertical grandeur of the composition acutely travesty such heavenward-reaching paintings as Raphael's Transfiguration. If Duchamp's readymades anticipate the art of today, the Large Glass prophesies cyberspace. (JJ)</p> <h2>Gaston Duf - P\u00f4lichin\u00ealle R\u00f4flise Vil\u00f4se (1956)</h2> <p>Duf's titles are as obsessively elaborate as his extraordinary drawings. Created from autistic retreat, his work, too easily patronised as Outsider Art, has a psychic edge that is lacking in the work of \"proper\" artists such as Dubuffet or Klee who attempted to suspend their self-conscious sophistication. (RC)</p> <h2>Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Self-Portrait with a Fur Coat (1498), Apocalypse of St John woodcut series (1498), Self-Portrait with a Fur Coat (1500), Knight, Death and Devil (1513), Melencolia I (1514)</h2> <p>The first time I saw a reproduction of D\u00fcrer's Self-Portrait with a Fur Coat, I thought it was a painting of Christ. The young man it depicts stares straight past you in brown-eyed absorption, presenting his face full-on; he has long curling locks spread over his shoulders, and a small beard like the one that artists give Christ. His hand against his fur collar might be raised ready to bless you. He looks as if he is about to deliver the Sermon on the Mount. </p> <p>The confusion is deliberate. D\u00fcrer is declaring that artists are like Christ \u2014 they are visionaries and prophets. Two years before he painted himself as the Redeemer he had, after all, showed people what the end of the world would look like in his woodcut visualisations of the Apocalypse of St John. In his Four Horsemen of Apocalypse dreadful riders crush rich and poor beneath their hooves; their fearsome eyes are utterly inhuman. D\u00fcrer could see all this and, with nothing more magical than an engraving tool and inked block, make it visible to everyone \u2014 was he not a god? </p> <p>Being a god is difficult. Christ died. And D\u00fcrer suffered terrible dark thoughts, already apparent in his Apocalypse prints. A brooding angel \u2014 the Genius \u2014 sits pensively in the most iconic of all his images with her face resting on a hand, in shadow, dividers held uselessly in the other; afflicted by the melancholy of the poet and artist, she cannot muster the will to work on her sculpture of a polyhedron. A bat holds aloft a banner inscribed Melencolia. In another a knight stares straight ahead, ignoring the hideous companions, Death and the Devil, that dog him through this world. D\u00fcrer's art is influenced by Italy where he travelled and whose Renaissance masters he studied, yet its inky, grotesque visions are rooted in the German forest. He is one of the first artists to express a personal vision \u2014 the manic pride of his Self-Portrait is justified. (JJ)</p> <h2>Anthony van Dyck - Triple Head of Charles I (1635-1636)</h2> <p>A king notorious for losing his head has two to spare in this painting done to send to Rome as a guide for the sculptor Bernini to carve Charles's bust. History has imparted eerie power to van Dyck's most metaphysical work. (JJ)</p>",
  "<h2>Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin - The Skate (c1725-1726), Soap Bubbles (c1733-1734)</h2> <p>Time stills and the world goes quiet when you look at Chardin's closely observed scenes and objects. His frequent depictions of people deeply absorbed in what they are doing \u2014 making a house of cards, pouring tea, blowing soap bubbles \u2014 is a metaphor for the patient work of painting a picture. In relaxing and slowing down to look at his humble scenes, you too join a triangle of contemplative attentiveness. A belief in the value of mental discipline drives this great artist of the 18th century Enlightenment. (JJ)</p> <h2>Cheo Chai-Hiang - Dear Cai Xiong (a Letter from Ho Ho Ying, 1972) (2005)</h2> <p>In 1972 the conceptual artist Cheo Chai-Hiang submitted a proposal to create an empty square measuring 5ft x 5ft that was to represent the Singapore River. The response from Ho Ho Ying \u2014 founder of Singapore's Modern Art Society \u2014 is reproduced in pencil on four large panels and sets out a discourse about the precarious nature of Singapore's art history. (JL)</p> <h2>Judy Chicago - The Dinner Party (1974)</h2> <p>A triangular table with place settings for 39 influential women from Sappho to Georgia O'Keeffe, via Elizabeth I, Hildegard of Bingen and Emily Dickinson. Its mission: \"to end the ongoing cycle of omission in which women were written out of the historical record\". (AH)</p> <h2>Eduardo Chillida - El Peine del Viento (1977)</h2> <p>Football's loss was monumental sculpture's gain when injury halted Chillida's career as Real Sociedad's goalie in the 1940s. His masterpiece, the Wind Comb, features three giant steel grappling hooks jutting from the cliffs at San Sebastian. It's unlikely that David Seaman will repeat this feat. (AH)</p> <h2>Ancient China - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/27/art-ancient-china\">read more here</a></h2> <h2>Chinese landscape painting - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/27/art-chinese-landscape-painting\">read more here</a></h2> <h2>Petrus Christus - Portrait of a Carthusian (1446)</h2> <p>A fly crawls on the frame of this portrait of a white-robed young monk with a tremendous fuzzy beard. You wonder why the museum allows such insect behaviour but it's a painted fly on a painted frame; it has been settled there since the middle ages. (JJ)</p> <h2>Frederic Edwin Church -Twilight in the Wilderness (1860)</h2> <p>The Connecticut-born Church was one of the richest and most famous American artists of the 19th century, producing spectacular, vividly coloured<br>landscapes. Arguably, this one is too lurid with its huge red, purple and blue sky, but it undoubtedly has wow factor: it almost knocks you out. And it also suggests there is change in the air. The civil war was looming; this is America at a crossroads. (MB)</p> <h2>Pieter Claesz - Still Life with Stoneware Jug, Wine Glass, Herring, and Bread (1642)</h2> <p>The ruffled metallic skin of the fish, the silver sheen of the plate it rests on, the light reflecting magically in a huge tinted wine glass and the musty liquid within \u2014 this is a painting about surfaces. With Dutch still life painting, what you see is what you get. (JJ)</p> <h2>Harry Clarke - The Eve of St Agnes (1924)</h2> <p>Inspired by the medieval stained glass of Chartres, the Dublin artist spent years perfecting the intense jewel colours of his own glass, enriched with etching and engraving. Many churches in Britain and Ireland have Clarke windows, but this secular piece, his mesmerising illustration of the Keats poem, is perhaps his masterpiece. His early death was blamed on overwork and the chemicals used in glass- making. (MK)</p> <h2>Claude - Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba (1648), <br>Landscape with Aeneas at Delos (1672)</h2> <p>Claude was a consummate landscape painter, his work hugely important to later artists, notably Turner. Many of his works seem to convey not only space but also time. In Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba a sense of temporality seems almost contained within the perspective, its background receding in layers like an old-fashioned theatre set. Points of departure are of interest to him; and in Landscape with Aeneas at Delos, there is a sense of the hero hovering between destinations \u2014 he is between his native city of Troy and his future home of Italy, accompanied by his soon-to- die father and his young son Anchises. (CH)</p> <h2>John Constable - Brighton Beach (1824), A Study for The Leaping Horse (1824-1825)</h2> <p>Forget the faded, badly reproduced version of Constable above your grandma's mantelpiece. This painter was no scenic picturesque faker. Observe, in these two astounding oil sketches, the way only he could unearth the rainbow tones in the seaside spume and countryside muck. It's as if he conjures almost tactile cross-associations between the stickiness of the oil paint and the quagmire that the horse is heaping from. The trees glisten with tics and flecks of lead white. And Brighton beach has never since looked so bracing. (RC)</p> <h2>Lovis Corinth - Death and the Artist (1921)</h2> <p>Here's the expressionist artist's lot. Corinth liked a drink or two and in this late self-portrait he catches himself in the mirror with the ravages of the bottle warping his face earthwards as a death's-head peeps malevolently from behind his shoulder. (RC)</p> <h2>Joseph Cornell - Taglioni's Jewel Casket (1940)</h2> <p>Artistic innovations often result from ludicrously simple shifts of convention. Cornell's innovation was the use of the box as a container of cryptic oddments, evoking reveries through the assemblage of created treasures and collected junk. Here, a velvet-lined box holds a glass necklace and 12 glass ice cubes alongside a legend recounting the 1835 plight of one Marie Taglioni, a famous ballerina, who, to save her jewellery from being stolen by a Russian highwayman, was made to dance upon a panther's skin spread over the snow and beneath the stars. (RC)</p> <h2>Correggio - Jupiter and Io (early 1530s)</h2> <p>A woman is embraced by a cloud \u2014 something you don't see every day \u2014 but the real surprise is Correggio's painterly triumph. Renaissance artists loved the challenge of the ancient Roman poet Ovid's tales of the loves of Jupiter, king of the gods, who took various forms to seduce nymphs \u2014 none stranger than that of a cloud. Correggio pictures a dark fluffy rain cloud seeping into the woods where Io sits naked; a green-grey vaporous paw slides around her waist as a face resolves out of the haze to kiss her. (JJ)</p> <h2>Piero di Cosimo - A Satyr Mourning Over a Nymph (c1495), The Forest Fire (c1505)</h2> <p>Enigmatic, romantic, deeply strange: these are paintings to make the imagination dance. In A Satyr Mourning Over a Nymph the dead nymph's head is cradled by her companion, while a dog sits sadly at her feet; in the background, more dogs footle around an otherwise deserted shore. In The Forest Fire, which perhaps illustrates themes in Lucretius's poem On the Nature of Things, animals and birds \u2014 woodcock, goldfinch, crane \u2014 take fright as the undergrowth bursts into flames; some of these animals are fantastical, with human faces staring out of pigs' bodies. (CH)</p> <h2>S\u00e1nchez Cot\u00e1n - Still Life with Poultry, Vegetables and Fruit (1602)</h2> <p>Seven apples hang suspended from seven strings in the shape of a hexagon. Two songbirds hang dead, and two partridges. A great curving bunch of celery, some phallic carrots and three lemons add to the mystery. More dead birds are displayed on a stick propped against the stone frame that holds all these objects poised on the edge of a deep darkness. (JJ)</p> <h2>John Sell Cotman - Greta Bridge (c1807)</h2> <p>Cotman's approach to landscape could hardly be more temperamentally different from that of his contemporary Turner. While Turner revelled in nature's tendency to drench his vulnerability in waves of light, Cotman's special penchant was for those moments when the fleeting atmosphere appears transfixed. (RC)</p> <h2>Gustave Courbet - A Burial at Ornans (1849-1850), The Peasants of Flagey Returning from the Fair (1850-1855), The Painter's Studio: A Real Allegory (1855), Les Puits Noir (1860-1865), Woman with a Parrot (1865-1866), The Origin of the World (1866), The Trout (1872)</h2> <p>The immemorial French countryside seems to parade its ghosts before us in Courbet's great painting The Peasants of Flagey, with its man in a tall hat sitting like a stone monument holding the reins of a cart; it is a scene whose geological weight makes you realise that Courbet, prophet of Realism, is among other things the forerunner of C\u00e9zanne. Strength, solitude (in a family<br>or a crowd), enduring truths and silent rage make this master of craggy authority a tremendously powerful painter. If any one person invented modern art, it was Courbet. He called it Realism, capitalised, and in his self-portrait The Painter's Studio he depicts himself as a political as well as aesthetic hero, saving the working class of France by painting real life as it really looks. His sensational shocking masterpiece A Burial at Ornans rubs your nose in the blunt truth of death. At its centre is a hole, a nothingness that Courbet returns to again and again. Some of his most haunting paintings are landscapes in his native Jura region that force you to look into the lightless depths of cave mouths. The rough texture of Courbet's art, the dry broken brushwork that makes the faces of his country people so harsh and authentic, is far from being only a visual trait. His awkwardness extends to sexuality, which he acknowledged with a scandalous insistence on \"truth\" \u2014 his painting of a nude that looks right between her thighs is called The Origin of the World. And yet, with his sensationalism and radical courage \u2014 he painted his portrait of a hooked fish, The Trout, in exile in Switzerland after joining the Paris Commune \u2014 he is ultimately a great artist of the countryside. His stony-faced peasants and small town types contain in their impassive looks the silence of centuries. (JJ)</p> <h2>Lucas Cranach the Elder - Lamentation Beneath the Cross (1503)</h2> <p>The bodies of the three men nailed to crosses are broken, tortured and ugly: Cranach reveals the horrific antithesis of the beautiful Renaissance nude, the body wrecked and dying, ruinous prison of the soul. (JJ)</p> <h2>Carlo Crivelli - The Annunciation (1486)</h2> <p>Prior to a major clean-up, Crivelli's Annunciation was just another yellowing panel by a minor 15th century master. Afterwards its super-saturated colours, computer-game perspective and startling image of the Virgin zapped by a heavenly laser revealed it to be the missing link between the High Renaissance and outer space.

  "<p>First Gordon Brown and Mervyn King, the Bank of England's governor, admitted that Britain was on the verge of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a>. Then food sales were reported to have seen their biggest fall for 20 years. Last night came final and irrevocable proof that the country is entering tough economic times, unseen since the 80s: AC/DC have returned to the top of the album charts for the first time in 28 years. </p> <p>Even by the standards of a band whose commercial success is a given - the venerable Australian rockers have shifted more than 80m records since forming 35 years ago (in the midst of the 1973 oil crisis) - the circumstances of their 16th studio album's British success seem striking. </p> <p>At one point last week, AC/DC's Black Ice was outselling its nearest competitor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/kaiserchiefs\">Kaiser Chiefs</a>' Off With Their Heads, by two to one, despite the fact that they declined to release it as a digital download, preferring vinyl and CD. </p> <p>Those keen to draw wider inferences from its success might note that the last time AC/DC made No 1 in Britain, the country was on the brink of recession. Back In Black, the album that marked their commercial breakthrough and went on to become the second biggest-selling of all time, was released in 1980, just as inflation had reached 20% and unemployment inched towards 2 million.</p> <p>When the economy recovered, AC/DC's popularity receded, albeit becoming merely immense instead of phenomenal: their \"flop\" 1985 album, Fly On The Wall, still sold more than 1m copies, a not unimpressive figure, but a fraction of Back In Black's 30m sales or the 5m copies that Black Ice sold in the last seven days.</p> <p>But right on cue the album that returned the band to its heyday was The Razors Edge, released in 1990 - just as Britain headed towards its last recession.</p> <p>AC/DC's appeal in unpredictable times is straightforward. People crave something uncomplicated and dependable in a time of uncertainty, and rock music has never produced a band so uncomplicated and dependable as AC/DC.</p> <p>For 35 years, they have done exactly the same thing - which in guitarist Angus Young's case involves dressing like a naughty schoolboy - unaffected by changes in fashion or band personnel.</p> <p>Not even the death of lead singer Bon Scott could stop AC/DC cranking out hard-edged, wilfully basic blues-rock, decorated with lyrics in which the phrase \"rock 'n' roll\" figures heavily, but not as heavily as sniggering innuendo about scrotums.</p> <p>Small wonder that people turn to AC/DC in their millions when the world appears on the brink of chaos. Here is escapism into a world untroubled by sub-prime mortgages, record public finance deficits and the baleful state of the FTSE 100, but escapism of the most comfortingly consistent kind.</p> <p>Western capitalism might collapse but at least Young can be relied on to perform a song about either rock and roll or testicles while wearing shorts, blazer and cap. Alas, what he can't be relied on to do is support those who delve into the sociological implications of AC/DC's appeal. \"What we do, you're not going to look into it with depth, y'know,\" he suggested recently . \"Because if you look into it with depth, you're not going to get it.\" </p> <h2>Highway to hell</h2> <p>1973: <strong>AC/DC</strong> form in Sydney, Australia. <br><strong>Economy: </strong>Start of the oil crisis, which saw the price quadruple</p> <p>1980: <strong>AC/DC </strong>release breakthrough album Back In Black<br><strong>Economy: </strong>Inflation in UK reaches 20% and unemployment nears 2 million</p> <p>1990: <strong>AC/DC </strong>score comeback with The Razor's Edge <br><strong>Economy: </strong>Recession in UK imminent</p> <p>2008: <strong>AC/DC </strong>top UK album charts <br><strong>Economy: </strong>Biggest world recession in decades looms</p>",
  "<p>There are few absolute rules in the world of TV but one or two stand firm. Such as: it's usually a stupid idea not to back Andy Harries. In 1991 he spotted Arthur Smith's An Evening With Gary Lineker at the Edinburgh Fringe, which became a monumental hit, launching Caroline Quentin and spawning Loaded culture. Granada, where Harries made it himself, must have been thrilled; the BBC, LWT, YTV and Channel 4, who all turned it down, rather less so. Not that Granada built on that success: in 2003 the then chief executive Charles Allen tried to block production of The Deal - Peter Morgan's acclaimed play about Blair and Brown - and ITV refused to show the finished film, leaving Channel 4 to pick up the drama (and the Bafta it won). And then there was the trouble with The Queen - with ITV's \"erratic\" approach to funding Harries' 2006 Oscar-nominated film contributing to his departure as the broadcaster's drama controller.</p> <p>Now Harries' fledgling independent is producing Wallander for the BBC, based on the Swedish novelist Henning Mankell's series of bestselling detective books and starring Kenneth Branagh; Father &amp; Son, a thriller with Dougray Scott, Sophie Okonedo, Stephen Rea and Ian Hart, for ITV; and for the big screen, The Damned United, with Michael Sheen as Brian Clough and Timothy Spall as Peter Taylor. And yet still there are those who'd prefer it if no one backed him.</p> <p>When Harries left ITV last year to found Left Bank Pictures, it was one of the first independents to have BBC Worldwide take a 25% stake. Since then, other indies such as Big Talk and Baby Cow have done similar deals - but rivals disapprove of the deal and are taking their complaints about Worldwide's investments to the culture, media and sport select committee.</p> <p>\"I've been surprised how many fellow indies have taken such a strong line on this investment,\" says Harries. \"The money is tiny but the argument has been - why should BBC Worldwide do something others do? But I think it's important that people understand that the marketplace wasn't delivering. We saw all sorts of interesting people on the back of The Queen - Martin Sorrell, Richard Branson - but us being a start-up was a problem. They all wanted an acquisition.\" </p> <p>Harries' argument is that Worldwide went where no one else wanted to go. The money for the 25% stake allowed him to set up and run Left Bank for a year, employing staff and pitching ideas. \"The reaction of these big indies is born out of a fear that it's threatening their own market share. New indies are not good for them.\" </p> <p>We meet on the day John Simpson warns that the BBC is under threat if Ofcom chips at the licence fee. Harries argues that a successful Worldwide would provide money to supplement the licence fee - with one proviso. \"My view is that the BBC should spend its money - in TV terms - on what they do best that no one else does. I don't see the point in them buying formula one. That was a waste of money - why not let Sky do that? No one else is going to do Little Dorrit or Bleak House and no one else is going to find a new State of Play. The BBC has a responsibility to be there for original work.\"</p> <p>Harries, just back from the Mipcom programming market, sees the BBC's commitment as key in a market where commercial broadcasters appear to be struggling with imaginative high-profile drama. \"When I go out in the market I still get a good reaction - there's a desire for stuff, but right now money is pretty tight,\" he shrugs. \"I expect the accent will be more on entertainment and feelgood drama than the harder stuff.\"</p> <p>He predicts dramas such as Channel 4's recent The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall will be difficult to find in an industry threatened with the credit crunch and the rise of download culture. \"I think Channel 4 would like to keep doing it but I think they will find it hard. ITV is changing and not for the bad necessarily. It's becoming an entertainment channel with the odd piece of quality drama. You can't beat up ITV for their commercial pressures. If they judge they need X Factor for their money and audience and future then you can't blame them for that.\"</p> <p>He checks himself for a second and says he should be careful about saying too much. It was during an interview with a Guardian journalist in 2006 when he was ITV's controller of drama that he voiced his dissatisfaction at the way the network was being run - it ultimately led to him resigning at the end of his contract last year. Does he regret that?</p> <p>\"I feel that I was incredibly lucky to go when I did, like the last windsurfer on the beach - I got out with good ideas at the right time and people have listened. I was restless at Granada and knew my ambition was best satisfied somewhere else.\" He prefers smaller creative units and argues that ITV's merger has made it too big. \"Great shows come out of tight teams where there's a little bit of competition, a little bit of energy and they're focused,\" he says. \"The mistakes at ITV are very deep-rooted - it's a failure of years of getting to grips with the basic problems.\"</p> <p>He does still have affection for his old employer, and believes someone will \"sort it out\" - either existing management or a possible future owner. \"ITV is still very important - it's vital that we have a vibrant terrestrial commercial channel for a good few more years. We need big drama on ITV. That's why it's sad to see Michael Grade knocking the indie sector.\"</p> <p>Making great programming, Harries says, is incredibly hard if you see the UK as your only playground. Wallander cost \u00a32.5m - he got half from the BBC, had to pre-sell to America and Germany and get a tax break for shooting in Sweden. As a result, he'd like to operate as a studio \"making films and TV shows that could even spin off each other\" with Worldwide as the distributor and deal maker. \"I hope I'm what they want me to be,\" he grins, \"a producer who provides international drama, because international drama's where they're going to make money.\"</p> <p>Harries has long drawn on America for inspiration. Cold Feet, which he executive-produced, was an attempt at a British version of Thirtysomething, while the format of The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross was influenced by David Letterman. At the same time, he executive-produced The Royle Family and has recently found American distributors confused by the essential Britishness of The Damned United. </p> <p>He also uses stars, US-style, to pitch shows. \"When I sat down with Helen Mirren and talked about bringing Prime Suspect back she wasn't really interested. But she said - if it has some politics ... So Prime Suspect 6 became about the increasing numbers of illegal immigrants working in the UK. You couldn't walk into ITV and say, 'We want to make a four-hour drama about illegal immigration and the impact it has.' They'd have laughed you out of the room. But if you say it's a Prime Suspect with Helen Mirren ...\"</p> <p>This sounds a little like entryism, I venture. Harries laughs. \"I'm a great friend of Malcolm McLaren after making a film about the Sex Pistols, and Tony Wilson was my mentor. They were situationists with a love of art and pranksterism. It seeps into your work. Making mischief is a good thing in television.

  "<p>John McCain shrugged aside daunting poll figures yesterday to claim he was placed to win next week's presidential election even as an inquest was beginning inside the Republican party.</p> <p>Interviewed on NBC's Meet the Press, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> dismissed the polls that showed huge leads for Barack Obama and said he sensed the race tightening.</p> <p>The Republican presidential nominee predicted a \"late night\" next Tuesday, suggesting the voting would be close enough to have to wait for the final counts in some states. \"This has been a very close race, and I believe I will win it,\" he said.</p> <p>But in a sign of how much of a mismatch the campaign has become, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Obama</a>, speaking on Saturday in Albuquerque, New Mexico - won in 2004 by George Bush - attracted a crowd of 45,000. McCain, speaking in the same city the same day drew only about 1,500 onlookers.</p> <p>Some Republicans, breaking with the convention of staying silent until the votes are in, are already dissecting his campaign strategy and acknowledging openly they believe the race to be lost.</p> <p>A blame-game has begun among McCain staff over responsibility for strategic blunders, in particular the confused and often conflicting messages the campaign has sent out over the past two months.</p> <p>At McCain's campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, demoralised staff and volunteers at the weekend listened in near-silence to invocations from senior campaign figures saying all was not lost.</p> <p>David Frum, Bush's speechwriter, who wrote the Axis of Evil speech, suggested yesterday, in an opinion-piece for the Washington Post, that the party shifted resources from the presidential race \"that is almost certainly lost\" to senate ones so that there would be a base on which to build a Republican revival after the election. \"A beaten party needs a base from which to recover,\" Frum wrote.</p> <p>Mark McKinnon, a former McCain campaign adviser, wrote for the Daily Beast website: \"The most popular parlour game in Washington DC these days is the bludgeoning of the McCain campaign.\" </p> <p>McKinnon said the McCain strategist Steve Schmidt, said to be behind the character attacks on Obama, and colleagues, had run a good campaign and \"taken McCain further than he had any reasonable right to, given the political climate\".</p> <p>He added that the election \"ain't over yet\" and that McCain might \"have a couple of barrel rolls left\".</p> <p>In another blow to McCain's campaign yesterday, the largest paper in Alaska, Sarah Palin's home state, endorsed Obama. The Anchorage Daily News said McCain had \"stumbled and fumbled badly\" in his response to the economic crisis and Palin was not ready to be vice-president. </p> <p>McCain now faces an important decision on the final days of the campaign. If he does assume he will lose he may want to be remembered as having fought a dignified race in the end - or he could throw everything at Obama. </p> <p>Yesterday he pounced on a Reuters/Zogby poll which put him only 5 points behind Obama (who is on 49%), saying that was evidence that the race was closer than indicated by other polls giving Obama double-digit leads.</p> <p>Obama, back on the trail after visiting his ailing grandmother in Hawaii, picked up on a comment by McCain, on Meet the Press, in which he had said he shared a common philosophy with Bush. Speaking in Denver, Obama, who has sought to tie McCain down as a continuation of Bush, said: \"I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk, and owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common.\" </p> <p>In Pennsylvania, Republicans are distancing themselves from an email sent to Jewish voters comparing a vote for Obama with the events of the 1930s leading to the Holocaust. The email warns of a \"second holocaust\" if Obama were elected, portraying him as a danger to Israel.</p>",
  "<p>It's official. We don't have to wait until the Eurovision song contest to laugh at the Norwegians, the Irish, the Icelanders or any of those funny, small countries. The prime minister and his new Scottish secretary, Jim Murphy, have decided that when it comes to the wee countries, it's OK to have a go. In fact, holding these nations up to ridicule is in the service of a higher cause: winning the Glenrothes byelection and trashing the idea of Scottish independence.</p> <p>Given little, if any, real Labour advance in the national polls, the contest in Glenrothes is taking on the status of win or bust for Gordon Brown. Losing the prime minister's neighbouring seat to the SNP might just have been recoverable if the Tories were once again in Labour's sights. But if Brown suffers the double whammy of a loss in Fife and only marginal gains in the polls, it is hard to see any way forward. Stand by, then, for the most ferocious assault on Alex Salmond and the SNP yet. </p> <p>Those who have watched in horror at the SNP's electoral progress over the past 18 months can barely contain their glee at the troubles faced by Ireland, Iceland and other small countries caught up in the global economic crisis. The argument is that only large countries have the muscle to protect savers and \"hardworking families\" when global recession hits. In cruder terms, English taxpayers are coming to the rescue of feckless Scottish bankers. </p> <p>There is no doubt that the politics of independence has been shaken. But the pieces may not fall quite where the unionist diehards are predicting. Before the global crash, there were signs that Labour was changing its argument against the SNP. For election after election, Brown had dictated the basic message - that independence for Scotland would be a catastrophe and prompt massive cuts in public spending as the country faced up to a huge deficit without the benefit of subsidies from taxpayers south of the border.</p> <p>Recently that argument has faced two problems. First, people in Scotland no longer believe it, or at least do not see it as a barrier to voting for the SNP. Second, it was proving uncomfortable for Brown himself, the chancellor and other leading Scottish politicians at Westminster, as their repeated (and false) claims that Scotland was heavily dependent on Treasury handouts caused some in England to argue that Scottish independence seemed a reasonable idea after all.</p> <p>Those realities prompted a rethink: it was accepted that post-independence, Scotland would no longer be an economic basket case, and that Scotland and England were stronger together and weaker apart. That new thinking has now gone the way of banking stocks. The old messages are being wheeled out, only much harder: vote for independence if you want, but when disaster strikes you're on your own.</p> <p>For the SNP, the last month has been uncomfortable. In recent years the success of small European countries has proved intoxicating. To some extent the \"small is beautiful\" analysis will have to be looked at afresh, but with the exception of Iceland there is little to suggest that small countries will permanently reverse their impressive growth rates. Norway, Finland and Sweden are still expected to grow their economies this year and next.</p> <p>The prime minister is first going to have to win a byelection, a general election and a referendum on Scottish independence having led the UK and Scotland into a recession and with unemployment forecast to reach Thatcherite levels. Against that background, attempting to scare voters in Glenrothes away from the SNP and Scots in general from independence on the basis of the foolish decisions of a few bankers in Reykjavik doesn't seem quite so clever.</p> <p>\u2022 Ewan Crawford was private secretary to former SNP leader John Swinney <a href=\"mailto:ewan.crawford@uws.ac.uk\">ewan.crawford@uws.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A tribunal has admitted making inappropriate remarks about an academic at Oxford University, issuing a public apology and agreeing to pay costs and damages after he accused it of libel in what is believed to be the first instance of its kind.</p> <p>The asylum and immigration tribunal has withdrawn the comments it made about Dr Alan George in a judgment published on its website, in which two judges warned that the accuracy of his evidence should be treated with caution in future. </p> <p>That warning was quickly seized upon by another tribunal, which followed the remarks, saying it was entitled to have \"fears about his objectiveness\". Those remarks have also now been withdrawn.</p> <p>George, an expert on the Middle East, had been invited to provide evidence in the case of a woman who was due to be deported to Lebanon. Experts say the incidents involving George are the latest examples of unacceptable measures taken by immigration judges seeking to reject asylum claims, raising questions about the integrity of the asylum appeals system. </p> <p>\"Impartiality is a non-existing concept,\" says Dr Sabah al-Mukhtar, a specialist on the Middle East who has been instructed in a number of asylum cases. \"The political agenda to reduce the number of immigrants tends to colour the view of those who are sitting in judgment.\" </p> <p>Another expert, David McDowall, who has ended his 15-year practice of giving evidence in asylum cases, said: \"There has been a desire by the adjudicators to fall in line with the government's anxiety about asylum.\"</p> <p>Comments published by the tribunal involving McDowall allegedly included a statement implying that his evidence had been influenced by payment and accusations of bias in his reports on the situation in Turkey. \"It beggars belief that the court can create such extraordinarily invidious comments in a public document,\" MacDowall said.</p> <p>Expert witnesses are often used in asylum cases. They are almost always instructed by the applicant, but their role is to be independent and to assist the court. Despite the tribunal's admission of wrongdoing in George's case, there are fears that an increasing number of experts will be forced out of giving evidence to protect their reputations. </p> <p>\"Judges generally do not display a deep understanding of conditions in certain parts of the world,\" George said. </p> <p>\"Independent knowledgable experts are so important because our function is to assist the court and not to act on behalf of either of the parties. This sort of unwarranted attack is a relatively frequent feature and one can only question the motives of those judges who indulge in this sort of conduct.\"</p> <p>In a letter to the president of the asylum and immigration tribunal, Sir Henry Hodge, seen by the Guardian, 14 academics from universities including Oxford, Cambridge and the London School of Economics have accused the tribunal of allowing expert witnesses to be \"harangued, unreasonably and abusively, over matters that are self-evidently irrelevant\". </p> <p>The experts wrote: \"We are dismayed that the Home Office, when confronted by expert reports which they cannot challenge, routinely resort to attacking the integrity and credentials of the experts ... Judges usually do not intervene to support and protect experts from such abuse. Equally regrettably, in their written determinations, judges often record the unjustifiable attacks, thereby conferring a degree of legitimacy upon them.\"</p> <p>Hodge responded: \"Tribunal judges are expected to do all they can to ensure that all witnesses are treated fairly and with respect.\" But he said it was \"essential that the courts and the tribunal retain their ability to examine the credentials of expert witnesses\".</p> <p>Mukhtar said: \"Tribunals should criticise experts if there are flaws in their work, but this must be on a professional basis rather than slander, and it mustn't be used to build up a case where a second tribunal discredits an expert simply because the previous one disagreed with his evidence.\"</p> <p>\"This sort of attack can have very serious consequences for one's reputation and on one's livelihood,\" said George, \"but ultimately it's justice that is going to suffer.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tony Smith has still to taste defeat in seven matches as coach of Great Britain and now England, but his long honeymoon is definitely over. For all the admirable qualities of Papua New Guinea's performance here on Saturday night, England were never very impressive and occasionally were appalling. It leaves Smith with a week to work the vast improvements that will be necessary just to compete with Australia at Melbourne's Telstra Dome on Sunday and rebuild their credibility as World Cup contenders.</p> <p>\"You'll see a different side down there,\" promised Adrian Morley, the experienced Warrington prop who, after playing under Australia's coach Ricky Stuart at the Sydney Roosters, knows better than any of this England team the scale of the challenge that awaits them. \"I don't think the Aussies will have been particularly impressed with what we did, but the first game of any tournament is tricky,\" he said. \"Most of the team hadn't played for three weeks and it was more like six weeks for me, so we needed a tough hit-out like that to get the rustiness out of us.\"</p> <p>Yet Morley was one of the few England players to do himself justice, along with his fellow substitutes Danny McGuire and Jon Wilkin, and the captain Jamie Peacock. Most of the rest fell well short of the standards that had been expected after such a meticulous preparation, although perhaps those expectations were unrealistic given inevitable rustiness.</p> <p>The outcome could have been much worse had the Kumuls been awarded a try early in the second half to extend their unexpected but deserved 16-12 half-time lead. However, a forward pass was spotted, and the decision triggered an improvement from England.</p> <p>But Smith said afterwards that he was especially unhappy with the performances of his half-backs, Leon Pryce and Rob Burrow, even if they were far from the only players who failed to treat the Papuans with sufficient respect. Even Lee Smith, the young Leeds wing who scored a hat-trick on his Test debut, blotted his copybook with a couple of defensive howlers. It leaves his place in double jeopardy because he also suffered a foot injury that will be checked later in the week.</p> <p>However, one old stager emerged from a full-blooded contest with his reputation enhanced. Almost an hour after the final hooter Stanley Gene was still sitting in the corner of the Papuan dressing room with one ice pack strapped behind his neck in a sling, another on his right knee, and a third on the left calf. \"I'm just trying to get the old body back in shape,\" grinned the Hull KR stalwart, officially 34, after an 80-minute performance that was inspirational to watch, never mind for his young team-mates to play alongside.</p> <p>But after spending a couple of seasons playing under Smith at Huddersfield, Gene had some encouraging words for the England team that he had just been tormenting. \"What a great coach, and he's got some great, talented players out there.

  "<p>\"And this will be a hotel\", said Oliver Corlette, as he pointed out a wasteland of brambles and rubble with a sweep of the hand. In the distance, beyond a portable lavatory tilted alarmingly to one side, a Soviet submarine had been taken out of the water and put up on blocks. </p> <p>Corlette is the managing director of Porto Montenegro, an extravagantly ambitious project that links two of the figures in the controversy surrounding the balmy summer nights that Britain's shadow chancellor, George Osborne, and new business secretary, Peter Mandelson, spent on Corfu.</p> <p>Nat Rothschild and Oleg Deripaska, who each hosted the British politicians on the Greek island, are minority shareholders in a plan to turn a former cold war naval base north of Corfu into what Corlette describes as \"one of the largest, if not the largest, facility for yachts of 30 metres and over in the Mediterranean\".</p> <p>There is a touch of Ian Fleming about the scheme. It is the brainchild of Peter Munk, a refugee from Nazi Germany who settled in Canada and founded the world's biggest gold mining company, Barrick Gold.</p> <p>\"It's what he's been dreaming about for 20 years,\" Corlette said. Munk, a noted philanthropist, hoped the project could transform the fortunes of tiny Montenegro, he said. \"This country will go from being one of the poorest [countries] in Europe to one of the richest in a generation.\"</p> <p>That is asking a lot of one property development scheme. But if everything goes to plan, within two to three years the world's super-rich will be berthing their mega-yachts on this enchanting coastline and Porto Montenegro will be a complex of promenades, lined with luxury shops, and piazzas, overlooked by balconied apartment - an entire new town, set amid the lofty hills and tranquil inlets that surround Tivat.</p> <p>Munk has put up 55% of the \u20ac650m (\u00a3518m) investment. Deripaska and Rothschild were among others who had put in 7%, Corlette said at his headquarters, a former naval officer's club. \"The other investors are about creating personal cachet and a marketing platform to bring in the right people.\"</p> <p>Pointing to a set of plans spread across the table of his office, Corlette added: \"What I have to do is bring in these big yachts. They give [the project] glamour. After that, everything else falls into place.\"</p> <p>A \u20ac50m, 50-metre yacht spews out cash the way an old-time battle cruiser belched out smoke. An owner should expect to pay a tenth of the purchase cost every year just to keep it afloat. The biggest vessels have a 70-strong crew, of whom maybe half live on board all year round. A captain commands an annual salary of between \u20ac200,000 and \u20ac300,000. Then there is the cost of the fuel, the repairs, the maintenance - and, of course, the food and drink consumed on board. Munk's dream is that much of this money will spill out into the local economy. </p> <p>\"If Deripaska has his yacht here,\" said Corlette, \"other Russians will bring theirs as well.\"</p> <p>Convincing the Russian metal tsar of the merits of the new marina ought not be too difficult. Local people recall that last year the skipper of Deripaska's giant yacht removed a chunk of the harbour wall at nearby Kotor as he tried to manoeuvre the vessel in the restricted space available.</p> <p>\"Deripaska looked angry,\" said an eyewitness to that incident who asked not to be identified. \"But then he always looks angry.\"</p> <p>Deripaska and his friend Rothschild have made a big impression locally. Someone who had worked for Porto Montenegro said Rothschild, a hedge fund manager, would arrive dressed in clothes so casual \"you'd give him money if you saw him in the street\". Yet he talked into his mobile phone \"about tens of millions and where to invest them in the way other people talk about the price of a dinner\".</p> <p>Already, there is a hint of what Porto Montenegro could be - a jetty lined with Spanish palm trees from Uruguay, granite benches from China and fountains made of Spanish olive grinders are already in place, part of the first phase to be opened next year.</p> <p>But as shares plunge on the world's stock exchanges, wiping out vast fortunes, it may be wondered how much of the Goldfinger lifestyle will have survived by then. But from his vantage point on the Montenegrin coast Corlette seemed unfazed.</p> <p>\"The good thing about high-end tourism,\" he said, \"is that it tends to stay more stable in crises.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339021272\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/26/MONTENEGRO_2710.gif\" alt=\"montenegro\" width=\"230\" height=\"255\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>Every police force in the UK is to be equipped with mobile fingerprint scanners - handheld devices that allow police to carry out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/idcards\">identity checks</a> on people in the street.</p> <p>The new technology, which ultimately may be able to receive pictures of suspects, is likely to be in widespread use within 18 months. Tens of thousands of sets - as compact as BlackBerry smartphones - are expected to be distributed.</p> <p>The police claim the scheme, called Project Midas, will transform the speed of criminal investigations. A similar, heavier machine has been tested during limited trials with motorway patrols.</p> <p>To address fears about mass surveillance and random searches, the police insist fingerprints taken by the scanners will not be stored or added to databases.</p> <p>Liberty, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/civilliberties\">civil rights</a> group, cautioned that the law required fingerprints taken in such circumstances to be deleted after use. Gareth Crossman, Liberty's policy director, said: \"Saving time with new technology could help police performance but officers must make absolutely certain that they take fingerprints only when they suspect an individual of an offence and can't establish his identity.\"</p> <p>Details of the type of equipment and the scope of its use have been revealed in a presentation by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA).</p> <p>The initial phase of the Mobile Identification At Scene (Midas) project, costed at \u00a330m-\u00a340m, will enable officers to perform rapid checks on the fingerprints of people arrested or detained. The marks will be compared against records on Ident1, the national police database which holds information on 7.5 million individuals.</p> <p>Geoff Whitaker, a senior technology officer with the NPIA, told the Biometrics 2008 conference that Project Midas would save enormous amounts of police time and reduce the number of wrongful arrests.</p> <p>At present, officers have to take suspects to custody suites if they need to check fingerprints. On average, the agency's research shows, the procedure takes 67 minutes. \"If we scaled this [saving] up to the national level that would equate to 366 additional police officers on the beat,\" Whitaker said. \"One of the benefits is that it will reduce the number of errors - and we can reduce the number of arrests significantly.</p> <p>\"There's a huge range of opportunities [for] mobile ID. It could be used on the deceased at the scene of a crime, on suspects for intelligence in the early part of an investigation, [or even] in a mortuary.\"</p> <p>Policing of big public occasions, sporting events, festivals, political conferences - as a well as immigration and border controls - could benefit from the equipment, he suggested.</p> <p>\"Another use is for prisoners in transit; it's not uncommon for prisoners to swap identities on the way to prison,\" he said.</p> <p>Project Midas, he said, would give the police \"a full, mobile national capability\" to check identities. </p> <p>The system is being designed to have the capacity to beam images of suspects back to officers on the streets to help confirm identifications. Some US police forces are already using the technology. </p> <p>\"The return of mugshots [to officers],\" Whitaker added, \"is something we would like to do.\"</p> <p>The tender document for Midas states: \"Bidders' solutions ... should include, but may not be limited to, fingerprint identification capability.\" Plans for a police Facial Images National Database (Find) were suspended last year but are being reviewed. </p> <p>One of the companies bidding for the Midas contract, Northrop Grumman, told the Guardian: \"A lot of the hand-held [devices] we are considering have cameras so they can support fingerprint and facial images\".</p> <p>A limited trial of mobile police fingerprint devices, called Project Lantern, started in 2006. About 200 have been distributed and 30,000 checks performed. They were deployed in police cars using automatic number plate recognition technology - stopping vehicles that were logged as stolen, having no insurance, no MOT or simply unknown.</p> <p>\"The aim was to deny criminals the use of the roads,\" said Whitaker. \"Around 60% of drivers stopped gave false identification details.\" </p> <p>Fingerprint checks often showed they were carrying falsified documents. </p> <p>The electronic searches, encrypted and sent over public networks, were usually returned to the mobile devices within two minutes; 97% of searches were completed in five minutes. Responses are graded as \"high\" or \"medium\". If high, it shows the system is confident of a match; if medium, it could display up to three potential identities. The returned data includes the name, age and gender of the suspect if there is a match.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the NPIA added: \"It will be up to each police authority to assess the benefits and see how many they want. Early indications are that the benefits will be huge.\"</p> <p>Thomas Smith, an officer from the Los Angeles police department, also briefed the Biometrics 2008 conference on the success of his force's mobile ID devices which send images and fingerprint matches back to officers on the street. He said they had become so powerful that once the machines were produced some suspects admitted they were lying about their identity. </p> <p>\"Our next thing will be facial recognition [computerised matching of suspects from their faces] in the field,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>This much we know: the politics of recession will be different. Now Britain's economy is shrinking, and with the Cassandras of the City and the Bank of England ever shriller, all the main parties are going to have to change their tune. Labour's \"no more boom or bust\" is busted. The Tories' blithe \"hello sun, hello clouds\" optimism now seems vacuous. And even the Lib Dems may be regretting their lurch to the right.</p> <p>The saga of Oleg Deripaska and his friends is about as good an image of politicians misjudging the mood of the times as we will ever get. He is part of a swaggering, plutocratic, super-rich elite whose protectors in the Kremlin are now a menace from the Caucasus to the Balkans, and to every EU country dependent on Russian gas. He might be a billionaire, but he's had his US visa revoked. No Labour politician, no Tory, no self-respecting British establishment figure, should have gone within a million miles of him. </p> <p>The damage done goes far beyond a startling lapse of judgment by George Osborne and Peter Mandelson. People everywhere in Britain are really suffering. It's bad and rapidly getting worse. Businesses are going under. Money is still not coming through from the banks. Jobs are being lost. Families are desperately reassessing their weekly budgets. Houses that were their only capital are sliding in value. And, more important, there is a cold atmosphere of fear stalking the country - fear of what is to come and how bad it might be.</p> <p>At this time, to read about the high jinks and purring private conversations of a Russian tycoon, an Old Etonian hedge-fund manager with an old name, Lord Mandelson and Bullingdon Club George, is almost intolerable. They might object that they were the victims of hideously bad timing - when the tryst on the yacht and the meal in the taverna took place, the full reality of the global economic crisis had not emerged, and Mandelson had not been summoned back to government.</p> <p>Yet that's not really the point, is it? This story reminds ordinary people how power worked during the long boom of the past decade, the smug summits at Davos, the private chalets, helicopters, jets and yachts, the close contacts between various Murdochs and subservient politicians and lately, the Russians. Money ripped out of Russia has been sluiced into European hidey-holes, and the people elected to represent us have gone along and ogled. </p> <p>I don't know whether Osborne will \"survive\" further probing about his office finances and the Rothschild connection. I don't know whether Mandelson will keep his place in cabinet if European investigations into his business links come up with more questions. I do know that the shadow chancellor has lost the authority he built up after his tax ambush on Gordon Brown. He will be judged more harshly and listened to less intently from now on. Similarly, all those who felt, \"let's give Mandelson another look, wipe the slate clean, offer him a fresh chance\" will shrug, grimace and turn away.</p> <p>The harder questions are for the party leaders. First, Labour. We should remain sceptical about Brown's bounce in the polls. This looks like a bad recession and leaders are rarely thanked for those. Callaghan and Healey took tough, drastic action in 1977-78 and were rewarded with a thundering defeat at Thatcher's hands. Major and Ken Clarke did their level best to sort things out in the last recession and saw Tony Blair stride easily into power a year later. The overwhelming likelihood is that Labour will be punished in a similar way.</p> <p>Brown and Alistair Darling have acted decisively to help the banks. They have not properly responded to the Tory attack on the level of state borrowing accumulated under Labour. Nor have they been honest about fiscal pain to come. Better to counter-attack strongly, to defend the increases in health and education spending, and ask for chapter and verse about which projects the Tories opposed at the time. And why, if Labour were being so profligate, have the Conservatives decided to stick with their spending for two years to come?</p> <p>Labour's core economic message has to be ruthlessly populist: the pain should not be visited on the poor, or the struggling middle. If anyone is to hurt more, it has to be the rich, and the big corporations. The merest suspicion of the super-rich getting away with it would be politically lethal. From Mandelson there has to be contrition, not defiance. If he can't manage that, he should go - yet again.</p> <p>The Tories have difficult questions too. Have they junked their green credentials in their panic about the economy; and if so, what distinguishes them from old Thatcherites? Can they find a more sober, less jeering tone to go with the new times? David Cameron has to play a different kind of politics. Hard choices about tax and spending are itemised and explained, not vaguely alluded to. Then there's Europe. With the pound falling so fast, and with much of the hope for recovery focused on pan-European action, is now really the time to be calling for an anti-EU referendum? </p> <p>For the Lib Dems, it might be time to reopen the case for joining the euro. Faced with economic and energy problems, and a more militant Russia, and perhaps encouraged by a re-energised, more liberal US, this is a time for Europeans to act together. As the economic storm rages, narrow nationalism will be less relevant, though for many it may be more tempting. Under Nick Clegg the third party has seemed less distinctive just when a different perspective is needed most. </p> <p>Yet millions will be looking for more still. We have been led into a world in which only a rampaging market system is considered respectable and where dull-eyed consumerism is reckoned the only safe measurement of human happiness. Fellowship, comradeship, fairness and the pressing need for more sustainable ways of living have all been shoved into the margins of public debate. </p> <p>Of course, the immediate crisis has to be weathered. But if ever there was time for a rethinking of values, it is now. Let's debate the successes as well as the mistakes - the light-regulation, light-tax treatment of the super rich and the acceptance of a growth-at-all-costs, fly-more, drive-more economy. After turbo-charged capitalism, don't we need at the very least a spell of quieter, more moderate capitalism? These are unfamiliar waters for politicians who have grown up in the good times. Dangerous, too. But not half as dangerous as the murky, polluted seas round Russian yachts.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>"
