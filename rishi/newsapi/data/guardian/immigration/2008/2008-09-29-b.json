  "<p>It was 1am when the phone rang and I heard the voice of my teenage son: \"I'm downstairs. Bring ice.\" By the time I reached the front door he was there with three friends, one of whom had been bottled and beaten up in an unprovoked attack as the boys walked home from a school friend's party. </p> <p>There is much wringing of hands over violent crime among teenagers. Everyone bemoans the number of kids who now carry knives and after each incident pronouncements are made on the need to give the police new powers to deal with the problem. But is that really what is needed? This week it was announced there have been more allegations made against the police than at any time since the introduction of an independent complaints procedure. Some 22,000 of these complaints were over \"neglect or failure of duty\". Therein, I believe, lies a crucial clue to what is really needed. </p> <p>When Nick was bottled, my son tried to help him, but was beaten back by the assailant's numerous mates. Another of my son's friends ran to a safe distance and dialled 999. He was told to go to a police station. As soon as they were able to, that is what the boys did \u2013 only to be greeted by a locked door. It transpired that all but two police stations in our borough are closed at weekends. Yes, shut on Saturday nights. Teenage crime, of course, happens at 10am on Tuesdays, doesn't it?</p> <p>The following day (having first checked Nick's health of course) we drove to one of the two open police stations. The police were pleasant and took the boys seriously but the computer was down and details were noted in pencil. They police tried to take photos of Nick's injures but none came out \u2013 they were using an ancient Polaroid camera. </p> <p>We provided the police with: the broken glass retrieved from the scene (using rubber gloves and a clean container); digital photos of the injuries and of where the attack took place; the name and telephone number of the owners of the CCTV camera that pointed straight at the spot where it happened; and (with help from mutual acquaintances and Facebook) the name and school of the main perpetrator and two of his accomplices. </p> <p>Confident they had handed the police a strong set of evidence, the boys were pleased to think this violent young man would soon learn you cannot treat people like that. </p> <p>Various letters arrived for my son informing him of victim support and giving him a name and phone number for police follow-up. Neither the name or phone number were correct. When I finally reached the right person they told me proudly that they had found CCTV that looked right at the spot. Unfortunately, they'd got the wrong spot. When I asked what they had found on the glass there was almost a laugh at the other end: \"That takes many weeks,\" I was told. \"There's a queue. Murders and rapes will go before y . . . It's all a waiting game in the CID.\" </p> <p>So we waited. Four months. Finally, I made a fuss, pointing out to the police that their delay and apparent disinterest was not sending a great message to law-abiding teenagers. Too late. The CCTV we actually needed had been taped over. Four months is forever in the life of a teenager and the boys \u2013 now in the middle of public exams \u2013 had put the incident from their minds. In an ID parade only two out of four of them picked out the (cleverly disguised) main culprit. The Crown Prosecution Service, quite rightly, said the evidence was too weak to take to court. </p> <p>It happens that I occasionally sit in criminal courts (for professional not family reasons!). Of the last three trials I have heard, two have fallen because the police did not collect the necessary, and available, evidence. In one case there were over a dozen eye witnesses. Not one had been contacted by police. Asked why, the police officer replied: \"The victim didn't give us any names.\" </p> <p>New draconian police powers are not what is needed. What we need is for the police to have sufficient manpower, resources, and commitment to do their existing job properly. </p> <p>After yet another news story of teenage knife crime, my son shrugged his shoulders and said: \"Well, lets face it, you can't rely on the police to do anything, can you?\"</p> <p>\u2022 All names have been changed</p>",
  "<p>An alternative to covering the eyes for those watching <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/newcastleunited\">Newcastle United</a> in their current state is to concentrate on the electronic advertising hoardings that border the pitch at St James' Park. As the team were going down to Spurs in the Carling Cup last week, the messages lit up the touchlines. One extolled the virtues of a scheme called the \"seat exchange\". What for? A quick half of Newcastle Brown, perhaps, or a couple of tickets to an off-peak screening of Mamma Mia! at the Empire on Newgate Street? Another proclaimed: \"3rd strip out now!\" The way things are going, Newcastle United may become the first team in the Premier League whose strips are labelled \"home\", \"away\" and \"disguise\".</p> <p>Few clubs can have shown the degree of contempt for their supporters manifested in the call for Joe Kinnear to stop whatever he has been doing since parting company with Nottingham Forest four years ago in order to manage Newcastle, pending the arrival of new owners. Having failed to produce one of several rabbits (Poyet, Ince, Hoddle, Venables) from their battered hat, the current owners could deliver only an ageing hamster who long ago stepped off the wheel.</p> <p>No sooner had Kinnear set foot in the North-east last week than he was giving it the old smokescreen, just as he used to do when under attack after one of Wimbledon's more repellent performances. The line about how he would only be at Newcastle until a new set of owners installed the dream duo of Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer turned out to contain not a shred of truth. First Shearer denied it on Match of the Day, with a derisive snort. And how, in any case, could Kinnear's temporary employers be sure of the intentions of the several potential bidders for the club? The fans were being thrown a nugget of fool's gold in order to palliate their discontent and put a stop to the demonstrations, buying those in charge a bit of time and perhaps slowing what must surely be a precipitous decline in the club's value to a purchaser.</p> <p>Newcastle's fans might also like to consider the current fortunes of those English clubs with which, as a player and a manager, Kinnear has been chiefly associated. Tottenham, for whom he played from 1965-75, are bottom of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>. Wimbledon, whom he managed from 1992-99, are out of business. Luton Town, where he was in charge from 2001-03, are bottom of the fourth tier, with a 30-point deduction for insolvency. Forest, where he was in charge for several months in 2004, are bottom of the Championship.</p> <p>Unfair? Possibly. During Kinnear's time with Wimbledon he kept the club in the Premier League until a heart attack forced him to step down, and he took Luton to promotion from League Two before being sacked when new owners arrived. It might be fairer to think of him as the stormy petrel of English football, whose appearance presages inclement conditions. </p> <p>At Newcastle, however, the tempest has already arrived, on and off the pitch. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mike-ashley\">Mike Ashley</a> is as disastrous an owner as we have seen. Dennis Wise is single-handedly making every chairman in the country think twice about the wisdom of appointing an executive director (football). Fabricio Coloccini, the Argentinian defender for whom the club paid \u00a310.3m, appears to have slipped into the role formerly played by Roque Junior, Taribo West and Jean-Alain Boumsong, that of an international centre-back of high reputation whose form utterly distintegrates on exposure to the English game.</p> <p>The whole farrago is pretty well summed up by the appointment of a man whose first two matches will be spent in the grandstand as the legacy of a four-year-old touchline ban. But if Kinnear can effect any sort of improvement at all in his short time in charge, he will deserve his money.</p> <p><strong>Saving grace for a driven screen great</strong></p> <p>I never saw <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/paulnewman\">Paul Newman</a> at work on a film set, but I did see him in a place where, by all accounts, he may have been even more comfortable: on the pit wall at Indianapolis, where he was helping to run the two cars of the Newman-Haas team in the 1993 500-mile race for a pair of world champions, Mario Andretti and Nigel Mansell. In a world that didn't give a damn whether his eyes were baby blue or ditchwater brown, Newman seemed utterly at ease.</p> <p>Yesterday's obituaries mentioned that he fell in love with the sport after starring in Winning - a better than average motor-racing drama - in 1969. His other films included the boxing drama Somebody Up There Likes Me and the terrific ice-hockey comedy Slap Shot, but it was the world of racing that exerted a lasting grip on his interest and emotions.</p> <p>\"It's the first thing I found that I had any grace in,\" he once said. \"I'm not a very graceful person.\" But he knew his limitations. \"I was never a great driver - I started racing when I was 47 years old - but I got to be pretty good,\" he said. \"I was a pretty good driver for about five years.\" </p> <p>Three years ago, a few days after his 80th birthday, he made his last racing appearance in the Daytona 24 Hours, his co-drivers including S\u00e9bastien Bourdais, now a member of the Toro Rosso formula one team. \"We all like to push the envelope,\" Newman said at the time. Few managed it with such genuine enthusiasm and unassuming grace.</p> <p><strong>How Cooke found all the right ingredients</strong></p> <p>After getting off her bike, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/nicolecooke\">Nicole Cooke</a> ran back down the track. Every time one of her team-mates - Emma Pooley, Lizzie Armitstead, Sharon Laws and Jess Allen - crossed the finish line, she shouted to them: \"We did it!\" Note the \"we\". She had just secured the women's world road championship, the last senior title of any consequence that she had not already won, and she wanted to recognise the work put in by those who had given her such unselfish support.</p> <p>Several years ago, tired of trying to win the world championship without the assistance of a proper national team, Cooke went to British Cycling to ask for help. At first she was told that she would have to join the track programme, which was the governing body's priority. Being an independent soul, she refused. A change at the top brought a change of attitude, and two years ago Dave Brailsford agreed to build a team around her. When Cooke outsprinted a world-class final group on Saturday, bringing to its climax a season in which all her dreams have come true, she was executing the last part of a perfectly realised plan. So that's another thing Brailsford got right.</p> <p><strong>The harming of Harmy - a heartfelt apology</strong></p> <p>This column would like it to be known that any previous criticism of the cricketer Stephen James Harmison, including suggestions that he lacked heart, suffered from homesickness, couldn't hit a barn door when it mattered and should never have taken up the game in the first place, were the result of errors in transmission and/or editing, for which those responsible are now being disciplined.</p>",
  "<h2>Kidnapped tourists freed after 10-day Sahara ordeal</h2> <p>Egyptian and Sudanese troops have rescued 11 kidnapped European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides in an assault near Sudan's border with Chad, Egyptian officials said. Egypt said \"half the kidnappers\" were killed, but did not give figures. All the captives were said to be safe and had returned to Cairo. The five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptians were kidnapped while on safari in the Sahara on September 19. Italy's foreign minister, Franco Frattini, said the rescue involved the \"intervention of Italian intelligence and experts from the special forces\" of Germany and Italy. <br><strong>Associated Press in Cairo</strong></p> <h2>Fighting forces 20,000 to flee to Afghanistan</h2> <p>Fighting between Pakistani troops and militants in Bajaur tribal region has forced some 20,000 Pakistanis to flee across the border into Kunar province, eastern Afghanistan, the UN's refugee agency said yesterday. Pakistani officials say the fighting in Bajaur has displaced up to 500,000 people. Most have found shelter with relatives in north-western Pakistan but about 100,000 have taken refuge in camps set up by Pakistani authorities. Pakistan's army says it has killed more than 1,000 militants in the two-month offensive in Bajaur. Cross-border attacks into Afghanistan have risen 30% this year. <br><strong>Associated Press in Kabul</strong></p> <h2>Solar panels installed on papal audience hall's roof</h2> <p>The first solar panels have been installed on top of the papal audience hall in the Vatican. Workers began putting photovoltaic cells on the roof of the hall to convert sunlight into electricity yesterday. Vatican engineers announced the plan for the first panels last year. Pope Benedict XVI has made conserving the Earth's resources an important concern of his papacy. Pilgrims attend weekly audiences in the hall when the weather is too bad to gather in St Peter's Square. Rome gets lots of sunshine and engineers say the cells will produce enough electricity to illuminate, heat or cool the hall. <br><strong>Associated Press in Rome</strong></p> <h2>Sarkozy's son cleared over scooter hit-and-run</h2> <p>The son of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was acquitted yesterday of fleeing the scene of an accident in 2005. The Paris court also ordered the plaintiff, M'Hamed Bellouti, to pay \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,596) in damages to Jean Sarkozy for \"malicious prosecution\". Bellouti had argued in court that Sarkozy rammed his scooter into his car, then left the scene. Sarkozy, 22, who was a student at the time, has always denied involvement. He is the second of the president's three sons and was elected this year to a local council representing part of the Paris suburb of Neuilly, where his father was mayor for 19 years.<br><strong> Associated Press in Paris</strong></p>",
  "<p>Dagenham's Becontree Estate was built between 1921 and 1932. Created thanks to David Lloyd George's drive for \"homes fit for heroes\", its 27,000 homes made it the world's biggest public housing project, and its ambience seems caught between the facelessness that comes from its mind-boggling size, and the remains of an idealism that Britain might do well to revive. </p> <p>These days, you can make out the enduring signs of another historic watershed: the one that began in December 1979, when the freshly elected Conservative government published the housing bill that enshrined council tenants' right to buy their homes, and commenced what was, arguably, Thatcherism's most popular scheme: what Michael Heseltine - then the secretary of state for the environment - called \"one of the most important social revolutions of the century\". Nearly 30 years on, its legacy is instantly revealed by the estate's front doors. Council-supplied models come in five designs, which are all soberly traditional; if you are a home-owner, you are more than likely to have joined in a quiet riot of stained glass, pastel colours and ornate door-knockers.</p> <p>Ken Collins, a 57-year-old former bricklayer, bought his house in the early years of Right to Buy: in 1982 or thereabouts, when council houses in Barking and Dagenham were being sold at the rate of around 2,000 a year. \"I knew it was going to be cheap,\" he says. \"I paid \u00a312,750. It's worth \u00a3350,000-plus now. But it's more than doubled in size.\" With evident pride, he points at the side of his house to the right of the front door. \"You've now got an extra bedroom downstairs, an extra bedroom upstairs, and the kitchen-dining room goes right across the back - 33ft. It's got an extra five rooms now. And they're big rooms.\" Even after all that work, his garden is still big enough to contain a handsome vegetable patch. Better still, it backs on to a neatly trimmed park, King George's Field. </p> <p>\"Once houses started to be sold,\" he says, \"people felt better about living here. People looked after where they lived more. And they were more interested in what was done to the rest of the place. Basically, it made it a more pleasant place to be.\" Squinting into the sun, he points at the other houses on the street and quietly utters words that you hear a lot round these parts: \"That one's private, that one's not, that one's private, that one's not.\" A few minutes later, he considers one last question: how did taking advantage of the Right to Buy make him feel about Margaret Thatcher?</p> <p>\"As a person, I didn't like her. Some of the things she did I thought were very good; some of the things were crap. I thought she was right about the Falklands, for one. And she was right about this, definitely. You wouldn't recognise this place compared to how it used to look 20 or 30 years ago. It was an absolute tip.\"</p> <p>Such is what remains of Right to Buy evangelism: the idea that ownership breeds responsibility in a way that tenancy never can, and the collectivist delusions of the past were best swept away by the property-owning democracy. To be fair, to thousands of people who bought their council houses and flats, their experiences do speak powerfully about the way that home ownership can transform lives, and embody what politicians now call aspiration. But in the midst of all the upbeat stuff, there are other stories that have not received nearly as much attention, often focused on what happened when the first generation of ex-tenants sold up and moved on. </p> <p>Though New Labour has not been as gung-ho about it as the Tory governments of the 80s and 90s, Right to Buy still remains one of the many post-Thatcher shibboleths that very few mainstream politicians dare to question - and at the blunt end, the way it was pursued can easily look disastrous. Proof of its negative impact regularly trickles into the news, but rarely seems to catch the eye of the right people. Yesterday, for example, saw the publication of a report put together by National Housing Federation and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, highlighting the fact that the selling of council houses is as much of an issue in the countryside as in our towns and cities: with nearly 700,000 people now on housing waiting lists in rural England, the report called for restriction of the Right to Buy \"in rural areas of acute housing pressure\".</p> <p>In 1979, 42% of the British population lived in council housing. These days, the figure is a mere 12%, with another 6% renting their home from housing associations and cooperatives. Between 1980 and 1996 alone, 2.2m homes were bought by tenants who became what the jargon termed \"owner-occupiers\" - and, give or take the property slump of the early 1990s, thousands of them became the beneficiaries of rising house prices. </p> <p>Tim Lott's 2002 novel Rumours of a Hurricane is an affecting portrait of how politics can occasionally define the plotlines of people's lives, founded on a married couple named Charlie and Maureen Buck, and a rise-and-fall story that runs in tandem with the Thatcher years. Go to page 210, and there it all is: in 1981, Lott writes, Maureen had \"wanted to stop Charlie buying the council flat for fear of debt. But Charlie talked her into it ... They had doubled their savings without any work being done. It was extraordinary, money for nothing. It went against some inherited, deep-rooted idea of how the universe worked, but there it was all the same.\" </p> <p>Underneath such miracles, unfortunately, there lurked all kinds of drawbacks. When councils sold properties - at discounts of up to 50% - they were legally obliged to use the money to pay off debt rather than to build replacement homes. The results of such restrictions were not hard to predict: as Shelter had forecast in 1979, the supply of what we now call social housing fell way behind demand, and we ended up where we are today: according to official figures, four million people are waiting for either a council or housing association home, and the number is expected to rise to five million by 2010.</p> <p>In the meantime, other consequences of the Right to Buy started to rear up. As the writer Lynsey Hanley points out in Estates, her masterful memoir-cum-housing history, by the mid-90s, \"95% of those housed by local authorities qualified for some form of means-tested state benefits\" - the root of the modern reinvention of \"council estate\" as a byword for deprivation and stigma. At the same time, a mess of problems resulted from what happened when the first ex-tenants sold their homes, and some of the worst aspects of the private housing market rose to the surface. Though no one in high political office seemed to be paying much attention, housing thus became a huge modern issue; certainly, in the past half-decade, the dysfunctional state of official policy in this area is arguably the key reason why immigration has become such a highly charged subject.</p> <p>Barking and Dagenham is an incisive case study in all this. Prior to Right to Buy, two-thirds of the homes here were owned by the council, which had one obvious upshot: though the profusion of privately rented housing elsewhere in Greater London accelerated its postwar passage into a multiracial society, the residence qualification for council housing meant that Barking and Dagenham remained largely white. In the wake of Right to Buy, however, there came a massive transformation. A stock of 40,000 council properties was reduced to 18,000, and the vast majority of the homes that were sold were houses. Over time, ex-council properties were sold on by their owners (often to private landlords), and migrant workers flocked to what was now the cheapest housing market in Greater London. In response, people born and raised locally decried the fact that they had no hope of the provision their parents had taken for granted, and soon enough, along with the decline of the local Ford factory that was once Europe's biggest car plant, it all fed into the political sea change for which the borough is now famed: 12 of its councillors are currently drawn from the British National party.</p> <p>The day I pay a visit, my guide is 35-year-old Liam Smith, the Labour deputy leader of the council, who is not only in charge of housing, but is himself a council tenant, with a fierce belief that council housing needs to be rehabilitated and revived. </p> <p>\"The good thing about Right to Buy,\" he tells me, \"was that it allowed people who couldn't have moved out of Barking and Dagenham to move out of the borough, and to further themselves. Some people might say it's also allowed people to borrow against their house, and give their children something, especially with tuition fees having come in. But the problem is that it's turned out to be like cod-fishing in the sea. Sometimes, you have to stop and replenish your stock. What we've done is fish, fish, fish, fish, to the extent that council houses have become an extinct breed.\"</p> <p>There are, Smith tells me, 9,000 people on the borough's waiting list for social housing. He also explains the scourge of what he calls \"landlordism\": private houses, including ex-council properties, being bought by landlords who then put locks on individual doors, and stuff them full of migrant workers and their families on short tenancies. As Smith puts it, this amounts to \"kids being pushed around from pillar to post, and homes that don't meet decent homes standards, and people living in Dickensian-style accommodation. A lot of them are vulnerable people, so they're hardly likely to be complaining about it. They're scared.\" </p> <p>On top of all that, he says, there is the insanity of a practice known as Private Sector Leasing: councils putting families deemed to be emergency cases in ex-council properties, owned by private landlords who charge them as much as \u00a3300 a week for places they once rented out for less than a third of that. So much money can be made out of this wheeze that in many London boroughs, property firms have been known to leaflet and cold-call council tenants, offering cash enticements for them to use their Right to Buy on the companies' behalf. In some cases, this has come with a particularly cynical twist: for the first 14 years of Right to Buy, any ex-tenant selling up within three years of buying their home had to pay back their discount, so property companies encouraged them to simply move out, get their upfront cash bonus, sub-let their property back to the firm, and then sell it to them once the time was up (one such leaflet, issued circa 2004 by a firm called London Investment Properties Ltd, features a picture of a man with a wad of dollar bills, and the offer of \"\u00a35,000 to \u00a320,000\"; they last filed accounts in 2006, and there was no reply when I called their listed numbers).</p> <p>In response to these pretty nasty practices, the Housing Act of 2004 extended the discount period from three years to five, which seems to have dealt them a sizable blow. </p> <p>Within all this intrigue, there is one particularly sharp irony: that contrary to the idea that Right to Buy would lead to some idyllic future of gleaming houses and perfectly tended gardens, the pushing of so much property on to the lower end of the private rented market means that too much if it has been left looking remarkably shabby and unkempt. </p> <p>\"That's happened over the past 10 years,\" says Smith. \"After Right to Buy, I can remember properties that straight away had lovely Georgian-style windows, crazy paving on the drives, nice brickwork - these little villas popping up everywhere. They looked fantastic; I can remember walking past, thinking, 'I wish I lived in a house like that.' I look at them now: they've changed hands two or three times, and they look dishevelled. People don't take pride in them, because you've got this six-month transit-camp situation. There's no community cohesion, the neighbours don't know each other ... Overall, if you took a sample of 100 properties and 50 were council and 50 were privately owned, I would guarantee you that the council properties would be in much better condition.\"</p> <p>Just about everything Smith says is backed up by plenty of other testimonies. That afternoon, for example, I meet Rita Giles, who has lived in her three-bedroom council flat for 32 years. Ruled out of the Right to Buy bonanza by the fact that her late husband's chronic diabetes made it all but impossible to get a mortgage, she has stayed put, and watched as a once-solid neighbourhood has been replaced by an ever-changing community of people who often appear to be simply passing through. </p> <p>\"The people who bought the properties don't live in them any more,\" she says. \"This is the biggest problem. They buy them, they do them up, then they sell them, and they get rented out. A lot of them go and live abroad.\" One of her neighbours, she tells me, bought his flat, paid off his mortgage, and eventually retired to Cyprus.</p> <p>\"Now,\" she says, \"you might have two or three families in one three-bedroom flat. I've seen that happen on our estate. We get a lot from Africa. A lot of short-term people come from Kosovo. The problem is, any sense of community is utterly eroded. Once, you could walk down the road and everybody who spoke to you, you'd know who they were. People still speak to me: they'll say 'Good morning', and I'll say 'Good morning' back, because it's in my nature to do so. But I couldn't tell you who they are, because with 95% of them, it's the only time I've seen them, and I might not ever see them again. They just disappear.\"</p> <p>Among those who have watched all this happen, one word from the housing vernacular is repeated more than most: \"transience\". The day after my trip to Barking and Dagenham, it comes up once again, when I make my way much closer to central London and visit the Peckwater Estate in Kentish Town: a mid-20th-century complex of seven-storey blocks that sits just behind the tube station. I have come to talk to Alan Walter, a council tenant, the chair of the national pressure group Defend Council Housing and a local community organiser, and Rose Goldberg, who bought her second-floor flat in the mid-80s, chiefly to \"have something to pass on to my children\", and has watched as the after-effects of Right to Buy have radically altered where she lives. </p> <p>As Walter sees it, in the early years of Right to Buy, \"Mrs Smith still lived next to Mrs Jones\", those who bought their flats were in a small minority, and the estate's atmosphere felt much the same as ever. \"But as more places have been bought, and more and more have changed hands, you've ended up either with absent landlords renting them to people they cram in on short tenancies, or people who've bought solely to get on the housing ladder and have a very short-term perspective on how long they're going to live here. And, again, they have very little commitment to the community.</p> <p>\"You see some people moving on to estates who are holding their noses,\" he says. \"They've probably spent six months agonising about it and trying to convince themselves they can do better, and then they decide it's the only way of getting their foot on the ladder.\" In addition to the kind of problems evident in Barking and Dagenham, such is yet another of Right to Buy's regrettable legacies: ex-council homes being thrown on to central London's overheated housing market, priced way beyond the means of people in the direst need, and then talked up in the property sections of national newspapers. Underneath that phenomenon, meanwhile - and when you are unpeeling the long-term consequences of Right to Buy you often get the sense of a socio-political Russian doll - there lurk practices that are altogether more illicit. There is anecdotal evidence, for example, of people in central London either being so reluctant to give up precious council tenancies that they unofficially sub-let on a cash-in-hand basis - or in the case of the truly desperate, both council and private tenants simply selling their door-keys for cash. Either way, such arrangements only add to the problems of once-stable communities that are now constantly in flux.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even if you take the official route to living in an ex-council property, the promised security and peace of mind may still elude you, particularly if you buy an ex-council flat rather than a house, become what is known as a leaseholder, and leave yourself open to yet another post-Right to Buy scourge: the habit of some councils of levying sky-high charges for building improvements. For tenants, building work can result in incremental charges or rent increases, but when it comes to the leaseholders who live alongside them, demands for vast lump sums can leave some people with no option but to call time on their dream of home ownership and reluctantly sell up.</p> <p>On the 16th floor of a high-rise block off the Harrow Road in central London, I spend an hour talking to 44-year-old Agim Sekiraqa, a Kosovan-Albanian refugee who was granted British citizenship in 1992. He lives in his two-bedroom flat with his wife and two children; having initially been tenants of Westminster city council, they bought it under the Right to Buy in 2002. \"I thought my kids would have a roof above their heads when we are not around any more,\" he says. \"That was my main reason. And at the time, we thought, 'Well, now we have our own place, no one can kick us out.' We felt secure.\" With a discount of 33%, and having secured a loan, they paid \u00a341,500. </p> <p>In 2005, however, there came grim news. In return for work on his block's exterior - focused on windows, balconies and cladding - Citywest, Westminister council's property management company, would soon be expecting a payment of at least \u00a358,000. In a small handful of London boroughs - notably Southwark and Westminster - this seems be common practice, and for the Sekiraqa family, it seemed to spell doom. \"It was a disaster,\" he says, and you can see his point: he does bits of work as a freelance interpreter and works part-time for his local MP, and his wife does likewise for Tesco. \"Once the work is done, we have three years to pay,\" he says, \"but over three years, we will earn much less than that. We're a low-income family.\" </p> <p>A cloud of anxiety has been hanging around the Sekiraqas for three years; the work on their block looks set to be finished at the end of 2009, whereupon the service charge will be payable. Their only hope is an eventual council tribunal, and a stipulation in their contract that in the first five years of leaseholding, the council guaranteed that there would be no increase in service charges. Everything hangs on whether this new demand is dated to when notice was served, or the first payment is due - and if they lose, things look bleak. \"We have two years to finish the loan we have now,\" he says. \"Applying for another one, on a low income, in the credit crunch ... that's not a solution at all. I don't see a way out of this situation. It makes my life miserable: I try to keep it inside and hide it from my children, because I don't want them to see that level of stress.\"</p> <p>If he put the flat on the open market, he tells me, anyone wanting to buy it would have trouble getting a mortgage, which leaves only one option, set out in a letter he recently received from Citywest. \"You may have read recently about the government's plans for affordable housing, and to reduce the number of people on the housing waiting list currently in temporary accommodation,\" it says. \"We are intending to deliver suitable accommodation targets by buying suitable homes from existing leaseholders and specifically targeting two- and three-bedroom properties.\" </p> <p>It goes on to promise \"an excellent opportunity to get a competitive price without some of the expense and hassle of using an estate agent\". </p> <p>As Sekiraqa sees it, the most he would be likely to get for the flat would be around \u00a3120,000, which \"would hardly get a studio flat in zone 4\". Worse still, though the council emphatically denies it, he cannot help but suspect that punitive service charges are an easy way of emptying some of the properties they suddenly claim to need. </p> <p>His advice for any Westminster tenant thinking of taking up the Right to Buy is simple enough. \"Don't do it. The risk is not worth it.\"</p> <p>So which way out of this mess? Looking for political answers is not easy, not least because so much of Right to Buy's legacy is way off the parliamentary radar, and mainstream politicians - in deference to the \"aspiration\" Right to Buy was once held to embody - are usually far keener to talk about new affordable homes to buy rather than helping those who either need or want to rent, or those hapless Right to Buyers who have been waylaid by some of its most malign aspects. </p> <p>In fairness to the government, it has a track record of ratcheting down Right to Buy, reducing the available discounts in many areas, and upping the minimum time before homes can be sold on. But the issue sits uneasily on the fault-line that separates old and New Labour, and the political damage caused by the opposition voiced in the early 80s still sits in the party's psyche. Thus questioning the policy itself and decisively getting to grips with some of its most damaging aftershocks still elude them. </p> <p>The Tories, by contrast, seem to be sticking by their old evangelism, promising to extend Right to Buy to the one million tenants of housing associations who are currently prohibited from taking out a mortgage on their homes. Conservative rhetoric is slightly cuddlier than it was 30 years ago: their housing spokesman, Grant Shapps, talks in vague terms about \"introducing measures to get the replenishment of our housing stock moving once again\", but such talk hardly impresses those housing insiders who think, with good reason, that putting jump-leads on Right to Buy would only deepen Britain's massive housing problems. </p> <p>All that said, such differences tend to get lost in a fog of cross-party tributes to public-private partnerships and the glories of home ownership, and the two main parties' support for transferring existing council homes to housing associations. Of late, only one big political party has sharply departed from the post-Thatcher consensus: the Scottish National party, which has announced plans to abolish the Right to Buy on new council houses and thereby encourage local authorities to get back to building them (between 2003 and 2007, a total of six Scottish council houses were built, and they were all in the Shetland Isles). </p> <p>The proposals will be put before the Scottish parliament late next year, though several Scottish councils have already resolved to build new houses in expectation of the change. When I speak to the SNP's deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, I mention Right to Buy's supposed embodiment of aspiration, but it doesn't cut much ice. \"Well, first things first,\" she says. \"I grew up in a house that was bought under the Right to Buy, so I get the aspiration argument. I think enabling people to own their own homes is a thoroughly good thing to do. But you have to look at these things in the round. We support, thoroughly, the idea of people aspiring to home ownership. But there should also be a right to rent for people who can't afford to buy or who don't want to buy. We have to make sure we have a balance in our policy, and there's enough emphasis on the availability of social rented housing, too.\"</p> <p>Back in Barking and Dagenham, my day ends with one last conversation with another Right to Buy veteran: 73-year-old Ron Goodchild, who bought his and his wife's three-bedroom house for \u00a38,900 in 1982 and now reckons it's worth around \u00a3180,000. They have lived here for 46 years, but soon enough, they will be on their way, like the neighbours who have escaped to various places on the southern English coast. One of his daughters, he tells me, has bought a house in Limoges in central France, and the plan is for Ron and his wife to join them. Dagenham, he tells me, has been \"depreciated\" by a lot of what he calls \"aggravation and stupidity\"; he isn't keen on the idea that Right to Buy had much to do with it, but like so many of the people I have met here, he talks about a mislaid sense of community and neighbourliness.</p> <p>Liam Smith gives me a lift back to Dagenham Heathway tube station, and tells me about two recent developments. First, the borough council is about to become one of the first local authorities to found a new breed of Local Housing Companies, set up in partnership with the private sector and aimed at providing homes for sale, shared ownership and rent - which some critics malign as further proof of New Labour's mistrust of traditional council housing, but Smith sees as \"the biggest step back towards it that we've had under this government\". Second, they have plans to start buying back the kind of ex-council properties that have long since been sold on and fallen into disrepair, and thereby bring Right to Buy full circle.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, he explains this last change with a barrel-chested pride. \"It's fantastic, isn't it?\" he says. \"We want to return them to a decent standard. I want settled, stable communities. I want neighbours to know each other - whether it be the dentist from Lithuania, the retired midwife from Dagenham, or the man from Nigeria. That's what council housing can do. It's just that too many people have forgotten it\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 The rise and fall of council houses</strong> A gallery and timeline of social housing <a href=\"http://SocietyGuardian.co.uk/housing\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk/housing</a></p>",
  "<p>No corkscrew. That's the first surprise about Chechnya. Unlike in Baghdad today or Kabul during the Soviet occupation, planes don't arrive high above the airfield and then dip one wing in a steep and terrifying spiral so as to reduce the risk of ground fire as they land. In Grozny they glide in over woods and villages, apparently confident there are no resistance fighters lurking in wait.</p> <p>Surprise number two is the amount of reconstruction in the Chechen capital. Five years ago when I last visited Grozny it still looked like the ruins of Dresden or Hiroshima, street after devastated street. Now new nine-storey blocks of flats, shops, and cafes flank the main streets. In the central square workers are laying the last paving stones outside what is described as Europe's largest mosque, a concrete replica of Istanbul's Blue Mosque, financed and largely built with Turkish aid and Turkish engineers.</p> <p>Tall, white concrete fences link the new flats, designed to conceal the waste ground, wrecked buildings and bomb craters full of weeds behind them. But the scale and speed of the rebuilding effort are remarkable, a tribute to the Kremlin's determination to spend huge chunks of its oil revenues on getting Chechnya \"normalised\". It is nine years since Russian troops recaptured Grozny in the second Chechen war but it's only during the year and a bit since Ramzan Kadyrov, Moscow's current favourite, became president that money has been lavished in effective quantities. </p> <p>New too is the disappearance of Russian army and interior ministry troops from the streets, a pattern of declining visibility which the Americans have started to emulate in Baghdad. The Russians retain bases and barracks near the airport and elsewhere on Grozny's outskirts but security is in the hands of Kadyrov's Chechen forces. Highways which used to be dotted with Russian checkpoints are open and unpatrolled. </p> <p>Like it or not, Russia has won this war. It is rare for foreign occupiers to defeat a nationalist insurgency supported by a majority ethnic community. Think Vietnam and Algeria for dramatic cases of failure. Britain's performance in Malaya, touted at West Point, Sandhurst and other war colleges as a textbook success, depended on the insurgents being from the country's Chinese minority. </p> <p>Like most observers, I never expected Russia to reach this point, especially after its apparent victory in the first Chechen war in 1996 crumbled overnight when the guerrillas infiltrated Grozny and launched a mass uprising. But Putin is not Yeltsin. He has played a long game, and even spokesmen for the remaining opposition activists with whom I have talked outside Russia accept the war is over, at least for this generation. \"There is no current scope for combined national resistance, and we don't want warlordism like with the 'Forest Brethren' in postwar Ukraine,\" one said, referring to the armed bands of nationalists who fought Soviet rule for a decade after the second world war.</p> <p>Russia's Chechen success has come at a terrible human price through massive fire power, torture of suspected insurgents, targeted assassination of guerrilla leaders, and subtle manipulation of money and amnesty offers. Moscow also exploited and deepened the divisions within the Chechen national movement. Ramzan Kadyrov's father was a moderate Islamist who fought the Russians in the first Chechen war, but switched sides in 2000 in opposition to the Wahhabism that was gaining ground over the secularists in the insurgency.</p> <p>Pictures of Ramzan - as he is universally called - adorn the walls of public buildings throughout Grozny. \"Happiness in the service of the people\" says one of him, in Saddam Hussein proportions, on the airport terminal. </p> <p>His compound near Gudermes sports an artificial lake, a Disneyworld-style fibreglass mountain, and a collection of panthers and leopards which, he says, he finds relaxing to watch after a hard day's work. But with his moon face and wispy reddish hair, the 30-year-old president cuts an unexpectedly modest figure. This is no strutting dictator in dark glasses surrounded by gun-toting bodyguards, even though his opponents say he has created an unprecedented climate of terror in which no one dares to criticise him. </p> <p>Kadyrov's language can certainly be blunt. Talking of Shamil Basayev, who masterminded the Beslan school siege, he told a group of journalists last week that he once shared a room with Basayev and quickly realised he was an opportunist with no real beliefs. \"I was delighted when I heard he had been killed, then sad because I wanted to kill him myself,\" he told us with no hint of a smile.</p> <p>The biggest irony is Kadyrov's unstinting praise for Russia. Since the Tsarist incursions in the 19th century, no people in the Caucasus have fought the Russians so fiercely or suffered so much. Yet now Chechnya's president boasts of having sent Chechen troops into South Ossetia alongside the Russians. \"Chechen never wanted a separate state. We have shown we will stay in the Russian Federation,\" he said.</p> <p>Some analysts say Kadyrov may secretly plan to ask the Russians to leave once their money has armed and trained his forces and rebuilt the republic. His opponents laugh at this, saying he is totally dependent on the Kremlin and they have other Chechens in Moscow to replace him if necessary.</p> <p>So where does that leave the dreams of Chechen independence? On ice but not abandoned, say the nationalist exiles who were always as unhappy about imported Wahhabism as the Kremlin is. They cite two factors for optimism. Yeltsin's bombing, followed by Putin's war, forced Russia's huge civilian population to flee Chechnya. \"The settlers have gone. Now there are only occupiers,\" as one put it. Then there is the new diaspora. \"Thank God the Arab countries never took Chechens in as refugees. They're safe from Islamic influence. Chechens all go to the west, mainly to Europe. They are getting education, and one day they'll be ready to go back,\" the exile added. </p> <p>By coincidence, his second point was also made by Kadyrov in our meeting. Whether the diaspora is ready to return as long as its leader is so slavishly wedded to Moscow remains to be seen. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>He has been filmed in forests, carrying arms and wearing paramilitary fatigues in the company of banned German neo-Nazis. Islam, he says, is \"the fascism of the 21st century\". He was photographed apparently giving a three-fingered neo-Nazi salute - though he says he was ordering three beers.</p> <p>He mocks gay people; wants a ministry for the deportation of immigrants; says \"Vienna must not become Istanbul\"; hopes to repeal laws banning Nazi revivalism, and is pushing for a constitutional ban on the building of minarets. Heinz-Christian Strache, a former dental technician, is the new star of Austrian politics and the new poster boy of Europe's extreme right.</p> <p>\"I was never a neo-Nazi, and never will be,\" Strache has insisted. But when he sued the Vienna news weekly Profil for defamation, the court ruled that Strache could fairly be said to display \"an affinity to national-socialist thinking\".</p> <p>Strache, 39, led his Freedom party to 18% of the vote in an early general election on Sunday. His former boss and mentor-turned-rival, J\u00f6rg Haider, single-handedly steered his breakaway far-right Movement for Austria's Future to 11% - meaning that almost one in three Austrians who voted opted for the extreme right.</p> <p>\"A unique case among the western democracies,\" said Profil yesterday as Viennese liberals reeled from the results of an election that put the far right comfortably ahead of the mainstream conservatives of the Austrian People's party and neck-and-neck with the Social Democrats, who narrowly won the election.</p> <p>It will be very difficult for any party to muster a parliamentary majority. The only options are for the Social Democrats to invite Strache into government, or to form another \"grand coalition\" with the Christian Democrats. Such a coalition collapsed in June after 18 months in office, and another attempt could fire a bigger protest vote for Strache next time.</p> <p>The Freedom party last stunned Europe in 1999, when Haider led it to second place with 27% of the vote, and a place in government. On Sunday, under Strache, the combined far right did even better, while the big parties did much worse.</p> <p>Strache has been heavily involved in extreme-right politics since his youth, when he was engaged to the daughter of one of the founders of the Austrian branch of Germany's neo-Nazi National Democratic party. He became a city councillor in Vienna in the early 1990s, imitating the populist techniques of Haider: snappy dressing, outrageous soundbites and populist tub-thumping; he was quick-witted and entertaining. </p> <p>By 2005 the Austrian far right was at a low ebb. The leader quit, formed a breakaway party, and in effect retired to run the province of Carinthia - before staging a comeback on Sunday. But it was Strache who took over the Freedom party and led it to an improbable success, taking 15% of the vote in Vienna's 2005 local elections . In the following year's general election, he mustered 11%, and then 18% on Sunday. </p> <p>He is widely seen as more aggressive and more rightwing than Haider, and likes to bash Brussels (an easy option in a country that registers just 28% support for the EU), inveigh against Islam, and take a loud and proud anti-immigration stand.</p> <p>Strache calls himself a true patriot, declaring his ambition to be chancellor or interior minister. He hopes to fashion a coalition with Flemish separatists, France's National Front, Bulgarian extreme nationalists and anyone else who will join in a \"European Patriotic party\".</p> <p>\"Thirty percent for people who portray national socialism as innocuous,\" wrote the commentator Hans Rauscher yesterday, \"Who crawl around in forests with neo-Nazi mates, who are surrounded by skinheads; who campaign against foreigners; make common cause with the European extreme right; toy with antisemitism; campaign against Muslims, and develop contacts with the Serbian Radical party whose leader, Vojislav Seselj, is in the dock at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Austria is tops in Europe again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last week, an inquest was opened into the case of Andrew Lee, a 33-year-old from Edlington in West Yorkshire who ate a plate of chilli sauce as part of a dare, and died from heart failure the morning after. It isn't yet clear if he had a heart attack or an allergic reaction to the sauce, made with red chillis grown on an allotment (his girlfriend said he had suffered severe itching the evening before he died). But should we be careful when cooking chillis? </p> <p>\"It is possible to have an anaphylactic reaction but it is certainly not common,\" says dietician Sue Baic. Actually, chillis are believed to have several medicinal qualities - they are thought to increase metabolism, can be used as a painkiller, and people in countries where chillis are widely consumed show lower incidences of heart attacks and strokes. Researchers from Nottingham University found that capsaicin, the \"heat\" in chilli peppers, could attack tumour cells in the laboratory, though scientists are still a long way off from creating treatments using chilli peppers. However, in Mexico and Thailand, the consumption of large quantities of very hot chillis has been linked with relatively high incidences of stomach cancer. </p> <p>The hottest chilli in the world is the Naga Jolokia (grown in northern India, it comes in at around a million on the Scoville (SHU) scale, the measurement of a pepper's \"heat\"). And in 2005 an American company marketed a limited edition chilli food additive made from pure capsaicin, measuring 16m SHU; to buy it you had to sign a legal waiver. </p> <p>There are some nutritional benefits to natural chilli peppers, though, Baic points out. \"Flavouring your food with chilli might mean you use less salt, which is a good thing. Chillis are also high in antioxidants, beta-carotene and vitamin C.\" But she recommends eating plain rice or yoghurt to counter the too-hot effects of eating chillis - drinking water can make it worse. Is the sweaty, tingling feeling of eating something that is too hot your body's way of telling you to stop? \"Possibly. Anything that makes you feel uncomfortable is not a good thing. Moderation is the key.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\">Lewis Hamilton</a> faces three more races in Japan, China and Brazil to complete the job he failed to do by a single point last year, and McLaren have indicated that they are prepared to change their strategy in order to sew up the title.</p> <p>Previously the team's philosophy has been to win as many races as possible, hoping that the championship would follow. Now they have decided to take a more measured approach, as evidenced by Hamilton's tactical run to third place behind Fernando Alonso and Nico Rosberg in Sunday's Singapore grand prix. </p> <p>\"I think an inherent weakness in the team and Lewis last year was the overwhelming desire to win the race at almost any risk,\" said Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren's chief operating officer.</p> <p>\"That is more forgivable in Lewis - you would like to have that in a young racing driver. We as a team should have been more disciplined than we were. Like here we didn't win but came away with more points than we thought, but if you scout around you will not see the euphoria that we ought to have, given the actual results. </p> <p>\"If I had believed on the way in here that we would go away with a seven-point lead in the drivers' championship and a one-point lead in the constructors', I would have snatched it with both hands.\"</p> <p>Last year Hamilton had looked poised to win the championship at his first attempt and his triumph in the Japanese grand prix was probably the most impressive drive of 2007. Then he slid off the track at walking pace coming into the pit lane in Shanghai and lost out by one point to Kimi Raikkonen in the final race in Brazil.</p> <p>\"We wanted to win and pushed too hard when we didn't need to. Championships aren't won like that,\" said Whitmarsh. \"Last year was an example of that. While it is excusable for Lewis in his first year, it was not excusable for us as a team.\"</p> <p>Now Hamilton has to ensure that he at least maintains the lead he established over Ferrari's Felipe Massa on Sunday to reach the tape first in what has become a two-horse race. The Brazilian's winning prospects here were destroyed by a botched stop on the 18th lap which left him trailing his refuelling hose when he tried to exit the pit too early.</p> <p>Ferrari said last night that they would review their electronic pit-stop light system. \"We were not using the electronic system, it was run manually,\" said the team director, Stefano Domenicali. \"When there are a lot of cars coming into the pit in a safety-car situation it is better to have [the system working manually]. You control the green light, and unfortunately there was a mistake. We will analyse what we did in the other pit stops.\" </p> <p>Domenicali said there was no question of the mechanic responsible for Sunday's incident being replaced for the remaining three races. \"We win together and we lose together. In that respect the philosophy will not change because of one unfortunate mistake.\" </p> <p>Massa said he had spoken to the mechanic and told him there were no hard feelings. \"I'm not the kind of guy who goes to the guy and fights with him. So I go to the guy and give him even more motivation because we need him and we need everybody together for the last three races.\"</p> <p>The Brazilian's consolation is that he has to battle only Hamilton and not his own team-mate Raikkonen for the title. \"The pressures of trying to win a world championship in a season when it's pretty obvious that the contest is going all the way to the wire can be really nerve-racking,\" said Niki Lauda, who knows about two-horse races - in 1976 he lost the title to James Hunt by a single point and eight years later he won it by the smallest-ever margin of half a point from his McLaren team-mate Alain Prost.</p> <p>\"It doesn't matter whether your key rival is a team-mate or not, you just have to concentrate and keep your focus. When I was racing Alain in '84 he arrived at the start of the season and tried to take over what many people saw as my team through the expedient of driving harder, faster and more effectively than me.</p> <p>\"In a situation like that it is very difficult to keep your mind on the job, but the way you have to approach it is to maximise your own potential while at the same time exploiting your rival's weak points. With Alain I could see that he was braver and more committed than I was prepared to be in qualifying, squeezing through gaps in traffic which I wasn't prepared to risk. So the only way I was going to beat him was through my experience. </p> <p>\"In the case of Lewis and Felipe they are both relatively new to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">formula one</a> so it will just come down to a test of nerve and consistency between the two of them.\"</p> <p>Jody Scheckter, who won the 1979 world championship in a straight fight with his Ferrari team-mate Gilles Villeneuve, stressed the importance of shrugging off the pressure. \"Gilles was braver than me and prepared to take more risks,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But he also made a few mistakes, dropping wheels over kerbs and so on. I knew I could bring more consistency to the job, but it was a question of not letting the pressure get to me. I was always confident I could do it, though.\"</p> <h2>Two-horse races that went to the wire</h2> <p><strong>Mike Hawthorn</strong> <strong>1958</strong></p> <p>The driver from Farnham became Britain's first world champion after driving his Ferrari to second place in Casablanca behind Stirling Moss, taking the title by a single point.</p> <p><strong>Graham Hill 1968</strong></p> <p>A three-way decider at Mexico City saw Graham Hill drive his Lotus to his second crown, edging out Denny Hulme and Jackie Stewart.</p> <p><strong>James Hunt 1976</strong> </p> <p>The British McLaren driver clinched the championship by one point from Niki Lauda in torrential rain in Japan.

  "<p>The apparent failure of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan\">Sudan</a> to block the formal indictment of its president for war crimes is threatening to plunge the country into renewed internal conflict, provoke a break with the UN and end cooperation of African Union countries with the international criminal court.</p> <p>Tribunal judges are expected to rule within the next two months on a request by the international criminal court chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, for an arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir concerning war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide allegedly committed in Darfur. Although action on the most serious allegation of genocide may be deferred, the other charges are almost certain to go ahead.</p> <p>Addressing the UN general assembly last week, Sudan's vice-president, Ali Osman Taha, <a href=\"http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article28745\">warned Khartoum</a> would view an arrest warrant as tantamount to a declaration of war by the western powers. \"Realisation of peace in Darfur and in [southern] Sudan, and the steps taken by the ICC, are two parallel lines that can never meet,\" he said.</p> <p>Bashir's spokesman, Mahfuz Faidul said Sudan was pursuing a peace initiative in Darfur and was considering independent prosecutions of alleged wrongdoers. If the ICC went ahead, <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_2397299,00.html\">he said</a>, Khartoum's response \"will be nothing less than ending all our agreements with the UN\". That could entail the expulsion of UN peacekeeping missions, aid agencies and NGOs in Darfur and the south.</p> <p>Sudan wants the UN security council to invoke Article 16 of the ICC charter, which keeps a case frozen for 12 months at a time. Its stance has won backing across the developing world, including the African Union, the Arab League, the Islamic Conference Organisation and the Non-Aligned Movement. </p> <p>\"Africa believes that the stability of Sudan is too important to be jeopardised by an abrupt adoption of a regime change policy, and that justice should be pursued in the context of peace,\" Sudan expert Alex de Waal <a href=\"http://www.ssrc.org/blogs/darfur/2008/09/23/africas-position-on-the-icc/\">explained recently</a> in his Social Science Research Council blog. </p> <p>He said Jean Ping, chairman of the AU commission, had suggested African states might freeze their cooperation with the ICC because of its perceived double standards.</p> <p>\"Ping noted that 30 African countries had ratified the ICC's Rome statute, expecting that the ICC would aid them in the pursuit of justice. But rather than pursuing justice around the world - including in cases such as Colombia, Sri Lanka and Iraq - the ICC was focusing only on Africa and was undermining rather than assisting African efforts to solve its problems.\"</p> <p>Activists passionately oppose freezing the case against Bashir. \"A suspension of the investigation would deny justice to the thousands of victims in Darfur,\" said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. A statement by more than 100 Darfuri and Sudanese diaspora groups, published by the Save Darfur Coalition, warned a freeze would \"embolden a government in Khartoum which has repeatedly broken promises\".</p> <p>Britain and France appear caught in two minds, anxious to prevent both a collapse in support for the ICC and a new descent into violence in Sudan - including the collapse of the already frail Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that ended the north-south civil war. </p> <p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, suggested last week that an Article 16 deal was possible, but only if the Sudanese government met stringent prior conditions such as ending all violence in Darfur. That seems unlikely since Darfur is not wholly under Khartoum's control.</p> <p>Although it is not a party to the ICC, the US is taking a tougher line. Richard Williamson, the US special envoy to Sudan, told a Congressional hearing here last week that \"as of today\" Washington would veto any security council move to defer or block Bashir's prosecution. He said he expected a court decision within two months.</p> <p>At the same time, Williamson admitted that the 2006 Darfur peace agreement had failed, CPA implementation was in serious trouble, that \"the necessary elements to ensure free and fair elections\" in Sudan next year did not currently exist, and that the 2011 referendum on southern secession was also in question.</p> <p>He drew particular attention to recent attacks on Kalma refugee camp and across north Darfur. Government troops, \"under the guise of a new law and order campaign to bring security to Darfur, are killing innocent civilians and creating more chaos in the region ... The mayhem, murder and misery continues,\" he said.</p> <p>Khataza Gondwe, of Christian Solidarity Worldwide, told the hearing yet another crisis was developing in the central Nuba mountains as Arab militia associated with atrocities in Darfur moved into the area.</p> <p>John Prendergast, co-chair of the Enough Project and a former Clinton administration Africa policy director, said nothing less than a multinational, UN-backed \"peace surge\" backed by an option for military intervention was needed to stop a descent into anarchy in Sudan. But while his and similar recommendations arise from genuine concern to help, the African argument, backed by most non-western actors, is that such interference may do more harm than good. The impasse over the ICC is only hardening. A train wreck looms.</p>",

  "<p>Standing next to France's President Sarkozy, the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh today made a heartfelt plea over the spread of anti-Christian violence in India. The sight of Hindu mobs smashing churches and prayer halls while Christians in the country are killed or left cowering under tarpaulin sheets in refugee camps is, as Dr Singh rightly described, a <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/PM_to_Europe_Well_protect_Christians/articleshow/3541497.cms\">\"national shame\"</a>. There are calls from within the ruling Congress party, which relies on the votes of Christians and Muslims in India, to ban Hindu extremist organisations such as the Bajrang Dal, which uses force when the force of argument fails. </p> <p>There has been bloodshed on both sides. One Christian priest was \"cut to pieces\" in front of his wife. A Hindu priest was shot dead for campaigning against religious conversions. The violence, which has left nearly two dozen dead, has spread across six states. Even after the Pope intervened, the Roman Catholic archbishop of one of the worst affected areas in eastern India said the situation was <a href=\"http://www.hindu.com/2008/09/29/stories/2008092955551200.htm\">\"out of control\"</a>. </p> <p>What lies behind this violence is nothing less than a struggle for the soul of India. Religion is deeply rooted in this country of one billion. The divine was fundamental in the creation of post-independence India. Unlike Europe, in India the Gods will not disappear in a blaze of rational thinking. </p> <p>But views of God led to a schism in Indian nationalism. One side is rooted in secular thinking: that beneath the differences among India's religions there is a common creed, a moral order articulated in the country's constitution. Opposing this is the Hindu right. Their philosophy aims to unify the country under the banner of the majority religion. It sees the country's post-independence constitution as an instrument forged by \"pseudo-secularists\", which now needs to be updated to reflect the Hindu character of India. </p> <p>Christians in India long pre-dated the British, who sponsored missionary activity with little success. In 1947, only 3% of the country was Christian. There's an unmistakable tint to Christianity in India: the priests are mostly upper-caste Brahmin converts and the flock is mostly drawn from the country's untouchable communities known as Dalits. Contemporary Hindu anger centres on the idea that India's rise will see an explosion of Christians in the country \u2013 a takeover by a foreign ideology like that experienced by South Korea in the 1960s. </p> <p>The Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata party, says it is against <a href=\"http://www.hindu.com/2008/09/26/stories/2008092657561200.htm\">proselytisation</a> through coercion, inducement, or by vilifying any faith. That conversion continues, therefore, and that it remains legal, drives Hindu groups into a bloody frenzy. By decrying the violence but remaining powerless to prevent it, the Indian prime minister exposes his strength and weakness. The Indian federal government could suspend state administrations \u2013 for failing to quell violence. This is the nuclear option of <a href=\"http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Sep202008/scroll2008092091069.asp\">unseating</a> a democratically elected local regime. Instead, the Indian prime minister chooses only speak up. </p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum\">Martha Nussbaum</a>, the noted American philosopher, draws a comparison with 1950s America where only a few groups such as the Ku Klux Klan would openly advocate violence, but \"where the whole society was suffused with attitudes that \u2026 often condoned violence against African Americans, attitudes that clearly affected the behaviour of the police and other officers of the law\". This remark is telling because, in the southern Indian town of Mangalore, it was Christian churches that were attacked, yet the leaders of Hindu mobs walked free for days, untouched by the police. </p> <p>The violence is the really about the clash within. Like the United States, India has never had a state-imposed religion. It has always had a tradition of sects and religious minorities, which coexist and compete with each other without suffering state persecution or patronage. Instead of trying to capture state power for the purpose of waging a cultural war, the Hindu right would do the country a service by reforming itself from within \u2013 promoting equality and unifying its own denominations and sects. </p> <p>Religion's role in India must be one of restraining passions, not inflaming them.</p> <p><em>To keep up with Randeep Ramesh's blog from India, go <a href=\"http://www.randeepramesh.blogspot.com\">here</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>Eleven European tourists and eight local guides kidnapped 10 days ago in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt\">Egypt</a> have been rescued by troops and special forces, officials said today.</p> <p>The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian were rescued in an overnight operation by Egyptian and Sudanese forces near the Sudan-Chad border, an Egyptian security official said.</p> <p>The Egyptian defence minister, Hussein Tantawi, said half of the kidnappers were killed in the rescue operation, according to the state news agency Mena. The report did not give a precise number or details on the rescue.</p> <p>The Italian foreign minister, Franco Frattini, suggested Italian and German special forces were involved. He told the Sky TG24 news channel that Sudan and Egypt carried out \"a highly professional operation\" with the \"intervention of Italian intelligence and experts from the special forces\" from Germany and Italy.</p> <p>The tourists and local guides and drivers were taken to Cairo and were understood to be in good health.</p> <p>The group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/egypt.sudan\">disappeared on September 19</a> while on a desert safari trip in a remote corner of south-western Egypt. </p> <p>The breakthrough in the hunt for the tourists came yesterday when Sudanese forces in north-western <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sudan\">Sudan</a> fought a gun battle against a group of the kidnappers who had been sent out to get fuel and food, the Egyptian security official said. </p> <p>Six kidnappers were killed in that fight, and two captured. The two told the authorities where the rest of the kidnappers and their captives were hiding, the official said.</p> <p>The Sudanese and Egyptian militaries, using two helicopters, launched the assault that freed the captives, two security officials said. One said there was an exchange of fire and that the hostages were freed inside Chadian territory, but there was no confirmation of where exactly the assault took place. </p> <p>Yesterday, a Sudanese military spokesman, Sawarmy Khaled, said Sudanese soldiers had been combing the Jebel Oweinat region near the Libyan border when they came upon a white sports utility vehicle carrying eight gunmen.</p> <p>\"The armed forces called for it to stop, but they did not respond and there was pursuit in which six of the armed men were killed,\" he said. The dead included the leader of the group, whom Khaled identified as a Chadian named Bakhit.</p> <p>German officials had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/egypt.middleeast\">demanding millions of dollars in ransom</a>, according to Egyptian officials, while Sudanese and Egyptian forces were searching for the abducted group.</p> <p>The kidnappers were believed to be desert tribesmen. Tour operators working in Egypt's western desert have reported several robberies of tourists in the area by heavily armed gunmen in SUVs and expressed fears that the violence could be a spillover from the conflicts in eastern Chad and Darfur.</p> <p>The vast majority of Egypt's 9 million tourists each year visit pharaonic sites along the Nile or Red Sea beach resorts, far from the Western Desert and the Gilf al-Kebir. The Gilf, a desert plateau 500 miles south-west of Cairo, draws adventure tourists with its sand dunes and desert cliffs, as well as a trove of prehistoric cave art. Around 2,000 tourists visited the area in the past year, up from only a handful less than a decade ago.</p>",
  "<p>The short life of <a href=\"http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/crane/crane.htm\">Hart Crane</a> (1899-1932) was packed with incident and accident. The child of a disastrous marriage, he left his birthplace in Ohio for New York at the age of 17, but he was consistently to feel at odds with 1920s America, even in its more Bohemian manifestations. His homosexuality apart, the visionary nature of his poetics set him at a difficult angle to his period. Ultimately, at the age of 33, he committed suicide; his body was never recovered from the Gulf of Mexico where he drowned. </p> <p>Crane admired both Whitman and Rimbaud. He believed the latter to be \"the last great poet that our civilisation will see\". His own paradoxical aim was to be a visionary poet of the machine age, seeking not only \"new forms\", but \"spiritual illuminations\". His surprising imaginative connection to William Blake was noted in a recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/sep/15/william.blake\">Poem of the week</a>.)</p> <p>His most ambitious work is The Bridge, a highly-wrought dramatic sequence in which he sets out to write the myth of America, and, incidentally, challenge TS Eliot, whose view of modernity he found too pessimistic. In the opening panegyric, \"<a href=\"http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15444\">To Brooklyn Bridge</a>\", he mixes archaic pronouns with industrial architecture to produce a grand, impressionist picture of the bridge, inviting it to \"lend a myth to God\". The sequence is essential reading, but the complex counterpoint makes it tricky to select from. I've chosen instead to represent a wonderful earlier sequence, Voyages, from Crane's first collection, White Buildings (1926).</p> <p>Poem V gives the male lover who inspired the sequence a halting speaking part, which adds to its intriguing complexity. Rolling wavelike rhythms are found in some of the other poems, but here it's as if the sea had frozen, its edges hardened. You can hear perhaps some of the syncopated rhythms of the Jazz Age with which Crane's poetry is often associated (not always convincingly, in view of his rather tightly-controlled formalism). It's a harsh and unusual love poem, not least because of the undertow of frustration, culminating in the unforgettable description of his relationship as a \"flagless\" piracy. The lover himself is a strange figure, almost ship-like, \"alone and too tall here\". After the brilliant and disturbing visionary flights (\"all the argosy of your bright hair\"), the final weary pleasure in relinquishing desire might, at least with hindsight, be read as a death-wish. The last stanza suggests, perhaps, a source for Auden's more famous and psychologically reconciled \"<a href=\"http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15542\">Lullaby</a>\". </p> <p><strong>Voyages, V</strong></p> <p>Meticulous, past midnight in clear rime<br>Infrangible and lonely, smooth as though cast<br>Together in one merciless white blade \u2013<br>The bay estuaries fleck the hard sky limits.</p> <p>- As if too brittle or too clear to touch!<br>The cables of our sleep so swiftly filed,<br>Already hang, shred ends from remembered stars.<br>One frozen trackless smile \u2026What words<br>Can strangle this deaf moonlight? For we</p> <p>Are overtaken. Now no cry, no sword<br>Can fasten or deflect this tidal wedge,<br>Slow tyranny of moonlight, moonlight loved<br>And changed\u2026 'There's</p> <p>Nothing like this in the world,' you say,<br>Knowing I cannot touch your hand and look<br>Too, into that godless cleft of sky<br>Where nothing turns but dead sands flashing.</p> <p>'- And never to quite understand!' No,<br>In all the argosy of your bright hair I dreamed<br>Nothing so flagless as this piracy.</p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;But now<br>Draw in your head, alone and too tall here,<br>Your eyes already in the slant of drifting foam;<br>Your breath sealed by the ghosts I do not know:<br>Draw in your head and sleep the long way home.</p>",
  "<p>It's the news we've been waiting for: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRNw7OGfw-U\">George Clooney</a> is returning for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108757/\">the 15th and final series of ER</a>. Paediatrician Doug Ross is one of many characters set to waltz again through the emergency room of County General. Also set for a guest appearance is Julianna Margulies as Nurse Carol Hathaway (who married the priapic Dr Ross/aka George Clooney/aka My Future Husband) and bore him twins. <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2008/09/04/Dead_Dr_Greene_to_return_to_ER/UPI-85161220564909/\">That nice Dr Mark Green</a> is returning too, but as a ghost.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/casualty/\">Like Casualty</a>, its UK counterpart, ER was forged in reality, that is scriptwriter (and former doctor) <a href=\"http://www.crichton-official.com/aboutmichaelcrichton-biography.html\">Michael Crichton's</a> harrowing experiences in a genuine emergency room. And like Casualty, it originally had an incisive political edge, teaching Brits about the horrors of healthcare for poor, un-or-under-insured Americans, teenage pregnancy (\"babies havin' babies\") and some searing depictions of <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941603,00.html\">gang war in Chicago</a>, with bullets flying and blood flowing.</p> <p>Amongst other innovations, ER taught us that a gurney is a trolley, while we are now accustomed to, and indeed expect, gorgeous doctors in peach or pistachio coloured \"scrubs\" (our medics now also wear those ice cream colours) to come frantically <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/profile?user=spaceyume\">crashing through swing doors</a> in a blinding flash of theme tune and strobe. </p> <p>Another development was in terms of character. These doctors were rarely saintly. My abiding memory is the unlikely exit of prickly \"attending\" and flamboyant homophobe <a href=\"http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/783633.html\">Dr \"Rocket\" Romano</a>, hit twice by a helicopter. (The first severed his arm, the next killed him. It was his destiny.) <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/ER/\">Waspish lesbian Dr Kerry Weaver's</a> revenge was justified, poetic and sublime: she founded the Dr Romano Clinic for Gay, Lesbian and Transgendered Patients from money he bequeathed, absolutely the direct opposite of what he would have wanted.</p> <p>ER even forced cosy old Casualty to raise its game, albeit briefly. But then both shows dissolved into unlikely, histrionic romances, trips abroad to a studio-bound \"Africa\" and ER's calling card: the gut-wrenching single hander. </p> <p>As the lights go off in County General, let's remember ER fondly for the innovative slash editing and the <a href=\"http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/steadicam.htm\">copious steadicam footage</a> following the harassed, heart-broken, underpaid, exhausted but beautiful doctors as they bark for an \"IV Push?

  "<p>I am writing this from my room in the MacDonald Burlington hotel in Birmingham. It was in this hotel 40 years ago that Enoch Powell made his notorious \"rivers of blood\" speech. As I wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/24/race\">earlier this year</a>, one unintended consequence of Powell's explosive <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/11/06/do0607.xml\">speech</a> was that it has distorted all discussion about race and immigration since. It has become almost impossible to have an honest debate about the subject without risking the accusation of racism. To say that \"Enoch was right\" still carries <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/1568317/Tory-candidate-resigns-over-race-row.html\">political risks</a> \u2013 and yet with the emergence of political Islamism, Powell's 40-year-old speech seems, if not prophetic, than at least bracingly relevant.</p> <p>It was with these thoughts swirling through my mind that I headed to a fringe event organised yesterday evening by the philosopher kingmakers at <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\">Policy Exchange</a> that sought to examine how to challenge political Islamism. The thinktank has, as the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/26/thinktanks.conservatives\">reported last week</a>, some form when it comes to this issue and its research director Dean Godson seems almost unhealthily preoccupied with the subject. Everyone on the panel \u2013 shadow security minister Baroness Neville Jones, shadow communities minister Paul Goodman and former extremist Shiraz Maher \u2013 was keen to stress the distinction between mainstream Islam and Islamism. There was no inconsistency between the values of Islam and an open society: the quarrel was with those who had hijacked the religion for political purposes. And yet even though the panel were proclaiming the necessity of drawing a clear distinction between mainstream Islam and the ideology of Islamism, the audience had been handed a photocopied front page of yesterday's Sunday Express whose front page screamed: \"<a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/63520/Cameron-I-ll-curb-Muslim-fanatics\">Cameron: I'll curb Muslim fanatics</a>\".</p> <p>Goodman later spoke of his reluctance to even use the word Islamism, as \"most people only hear the first five letters\". This is about more than semantics: use the wrong words and one risks not only inflaming tensions but stirring resentment from the very people who are most needed to help the battle against violent extremism.</p> <p>So how to tackle the lure of political Islamism? The ideas floated at the fringe \u2013 banning groups such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, not conferring legitimacy on organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.mcb.org.uk/\">Muslim Council of Britain</a>, encouraging the teaching of a more moderate interpretation of Islam in mosques \u2013 failed to answer a critical question: why are some young British Muslims receptive to the Islamist message? Who has let them down and why? Interestingly, the word \"multiculturalism\" was not used during the course of the discussion. Dominic Grieve, in a recent Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/27/dominicgrieve.conservatives\">interview</a>, talked of the \"terrible\" impact of multiculturalism and suggested that the vacuum it created was responsible for the rise of extremism. </p> <p>This is only partly persuasive. Is it multiculturalism that has led to de facto segregation in schools, or is the combination of poverty and white flight? These days multiculturalism has become a handy all-purpose explanation for all that is wrong in society. That may be sufficient for opposition, but not for governing. Goodman suggested that the solution to the threat of political Islamism lay in supporting both mainstream Islam and a renewed sense of Britishness. Among his ideas were the compulsory teaching of history in schools, the establishment of an Institute of British Islam and a holiday to celebrate the Queen's birthday.</p> <p>Some believe that Islam is fundamentally opposed to liberal values and therefore there is no such thing as a moderate, tolerant Islam; others are sceptical of any talk of Britishness, believing Gordon Brown is merely trying to deflect attention from his Scottish problem. I believe that supporting a stronger sense of Britishness, reminding all communities about the things that we have in common rather than stressing differences, does lie at the heart of any solution to political Islamism. It <em>is</em> a battle for hearts and minds but, crucially, it is a battle which needs the support of Muslims to succeed. The challenge for all those who oppose the distorted ideology of Islamism is how to isolate the extremists without alienating and antagonising moderate and mainstream Muslims.</p> <p>And so I return to the ghost of Enoch Powell. In the 40 years since his speech the Conservatives have, for many ethnic minorities, been the nasty party. The challenge for Tories today is to show that their rightful concerns about Islamism are not a proxy restatement of broader prejudices; they need to demonstrate that they are at ease with a diverse and heterogeneous society. If the Conservatives can do that \u2013 and I left the discussion feeling cautiously optimistic \u2013 then they can legitimately claim to have lifted the curse of Enoch Powell. But for now the question remains: can Muslims trust the Tories?</p>",

  "<p>Whenever there is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">systemic banking crisis</a> there is a need to recapitalise the banking/financial system to avoid a destructive credit contraction. But purchasing toxic/illiquid assets of the financial system is not the most effective and efficient way to do this. </p> <p>Such government-led recapitalisation \u2013 via the use of public resources \u2013 can occur in a number of ways: by purchasing bad assets or loans; an injection of preferred shares; an injection of common shares; a purchase of subordinated debt; an issuance of bonds to be placed on the banks' balance sheet; an injection of cash; credit lines extended to the banks and government assumption of government liabilities.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp08224.pdf\">recent IMF study (pdf)</a> of 42 systemic banking crises across the world shows how different crises were resolved. </p> <p>In only 32 of the 42 cases was there any government financial intervention of any sort; in 10 cases systemic banking crises were resolved without any such action. Of the 32 cases where the government did recapitalise the banking system, only seven included a programme of purchase of bad assets/loans (like the one proposed by the US Treasury). </p> <p>In 25 other cases there was no state purchase of such toxic assets. Even in cases where bad assets were purchased \u2013 as in Chile \u2013 dividends were suspended and all profits and recoveries had to be used to repurchase the bad assets. Of course, in most cases multiple forms of government recapitalisation of banks were used.</p> <p>But government purchase of bad assets was the exception rather than the rule. It was used only in Mexico, Japan, Bolivia, Czech Republic, Jamaica, Malaysia, and Paraguay. Even in six of these seven cases, purchase of bad assets such recapitalisation was combined with such moves as government purchase of preferred shares or subordinated debt. </p> <p>In the Scandinavian banking crises (Sweden, Norway, Finland) which are a model of how a banking crisis should be resolved, most of the recapitalisation occurred through various injections of public capital rather than a government purchase of bad assets. </p> <p>Purchase of toxic assets \u2013 in most cases in which it was used \u2013 made the fiscal cost of the crisis much higher and expensive (as in Japan and Mexico).</p> <p>Thus the claim by the Fed and Treasury that spending $700bn of public money is the best way to recapitalise banks has absolutely no factual basis or justification. It is a total rip-off that will mostly benefit \u2013 at a huge expense for the US taxpayer \u2013 the common and preferred shareholders and even the unsecured creditors of the banks. </p> <p>Even the late addition of some conditions is a fig leaf of dubious value, as they are totally vague and fuzzy.</p> <p>With $700bn of public cash the pockets of reckless bankers and investors have been made fatter under the fake argument that bailing out Wall Street was necessary to rescue Main Street from a severe recession. The rescue could have been achieved with a cheaper and better use of public money.</p> <p>Indeed, neither does the plan address the need to recapitalise those financial institutions. This could have been done via public injections of preferred shares into these firms; via required matching injections of tier one capital by current shareholders to make sure that such shareholders take first-tier loss; via suspension of dividends payments or via a an unsecured debt-for-equity swap. </p> <p>All these actions would have implied much lower fiscal costs, and they would have been cheaper and shared the burden of responsibility more equitably. </p> <p>For example if the private sector had done its fair share, only $350bn of public money would have been required; and of this $350bn, half could have taken the form of purchase of bad assets and the other half should have taken the form of injection of public capital in these financial institutions. </p> <p>So instead of purchasing (most likely at an excessive price) $700bn of toxic assets, the government could have achieved the same result, or better, by spending only $175bn in the direct purchase of toxic assets. </p> <p>And even after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/28/us.bail.out.congress.deal\">government bail-out</a>, banks that have not yet provisioned for such losses and writedowns will be even more undercapitalised than before. So this plan does not even achieve its basic objective. </p> <p>The treasury plan also does not explicitly include an <a href=\"http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/253739/home_home_owners_mortgage_enterprise_a_10_step_plan_to_resolve_the_financial_crisis\">HOLC-style programme</a> to reduce the debt burden of the distressed household sector. Without such a component, the debt overhang of the household sector will continue to depress consumption spending and will exacerbate the current economic recession.</p> <p>Thus, the treasury plan is a disgrace: a bail-out of reckless bankers, lenders and investors that provides little direct debt relief to borrowers and financially stressed households and that will come at a very high cost to the US taxpayer. And the plan does nothing to resolve the severe stress in money markets and interbank markets that are now close to a systemic meltdown. </p> <p>It is pathetic that Congress did not consult any of the many professional economists that have presented \u2013 many on the <a href=\"http://www.rgemonitor.com/financemarkets-monitor\">RGE Monitor Finance blog forum</a> \u2013 alternative plans that were more fair and efficient. </p> <p>This is again a case of privatising the gains and socialising the losses; a bail-out and socialism for the rich, the well-connected and Wall Street. And it is a scandal that even Congressional Democrats have fallen for this treasury scam that does little to help millions of distressed, debt-saddled home-owners.</p> <p><em>This article is cross-posted and re-edited for style and length by permission of the author.

  "<p>The death of one of the German-speaking world's best-known female actors could hardly have been more prosaic. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romy_Schneider\">Romy Schneider</a> was found by her partner <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0702466/\">Laurent Petin</a>, in their Paris apartment, sitting lifelessly at her desk. Slumped over the arm of her chair, an empty bottle of red wine in front of her, she had started to write a letter to a women's magazine to cancel an interview. Her words broke off mid-sentence, the result of a heart attack, probably induced by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol. It was May 1982 and Schneider was just 43.</p> <p>It is a scene which will be re-enacted in two film versions of the actor's life due out next year, one called <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210101/\">Romy</a>, starring Jessica Schwarz for SWR, an affiliate of German broadcaster ARD, the other, Warner Bros' <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210060/\">A Woman Like Romy</a>, starring German soap star <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1140998/\">Yvonne Catterfeld</a>.</p> <p>Variety magazine has described the Austrian Schneider as \"a magnet for film-makers\". But it was not ever so. Germany is celebrating what would have been her 70th birthday this week and the commemorations, marked by the usual coffee table books, DVD re-releases and film posters, stand in stark contrast to the way the German-speaking world used to perceive her. She was viewed as something of a traitor for turning her back on Germany. </p> <p>Unlike Dietrich or Hedy Lamarr, who both shunned Nazi Germany and were never fully forgiven for doing so, the younger Schneider's \"crime\", like many German stars before and since, was simply that she chose to make her fortune in the tougher but more lucrative film studios of Paris and Hollywood, where of course the most beautiful lovers also resided, rather than in the Germany of the economic miracle era.</p> <p>The height of Schneider's fame came with the hugely popular Sissi trilogy of the 1950s in which she played the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_of_Bavaria\">19th-century Bavarian princess</a> who went on to became Empress of Austria. She later starred as a more mature Sissi once again in Luchino Visconti's 1972 film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068883/\">Ludwig</a> about the life of King Ludwig II of Bavaria.</p> <p>She once complained: \"Sissi sticks to me just like oatmeal.\"</p> <p>Indeed the Sissi roles somewhat overshadowed some of her other - arguably more memorable - film appearances, including Clive Donner's What's New Pussycat, Orson Welles' The Trial and Jacques Deray's The Swimming Pool, one of several films she made with her erstwhile lover Alain Delon.<br>Her early death certainly contributed to the mythical perception of her as the tortured woman of German film. After all her private tragedies certainly towered above the dramas in which she starred.</p> <p>From the start her life was overshadowed by German history. She was born Rosemarie Albach in Vienna to her actor father, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0016208/\">Wolf Albach-Retty</a>, and her film-star mother, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003579/\">Magda Schneider</a>. From their house they could see Hitler's holiday domicile, Obersalzberg, where the Fuhrer received them, later declaring Magda to be his favourite actress. Romy would later claim her mother and Hitler had had an affair. It is perhaps no accident that she went on to play many Nazi-persecuted Jews.</p> <p>She met Delon in 1959 and lived with him for five years, until one day he left her. His farewell note read: \"Gone to Mexico with Natalie.\" She slashed her wrists in response.</p> <p>In 1966 she married the director Harry Meyen, a depressive due to the torture treatment he had received at the hands of the Gestapo as a \"half-Jew\". He later hanged himself.</p> <p>Her second marriage to her secretary Daniel Biasini ended in a divorce battle in 1981. She had an operation to remove a tumour on her kidneys, and then in the same year her 14-year-old son David punctured his femoral artery when climbing an iron-spiked fence at his step-grandparents' home, and died.</p> <p>\"I'm just an unhappy 42-year-old woman and my name is Romy Schneider,\" she said in one of her last interviews.</p> <p>It has taken years since her death for Germans to fall in love with her. Two years ago she was voted Germany's favourite actress by German broadcaster ZDF, and now, in time for her 70th, so many picture books and biographies have emerged that it seems her rehabilitation is almost complete. Next year the Filmmuseum on Potsdamer Platz will stage a glitzy Romy Schneider retrospective, complete with her costumes and jewellery.</p> <p>It just goes to show that if you want to be loved, dying a young and tragic death helps no end.</p>",
  "<p>It's not like I hadn't been warned that Copenhagen would be pricey. The city regularly features in surveys of the <a href=\"http://www.mercer.com/costofliving\">world's most expensive destinations</a>, and for weeks before, every time I mentioned where I was going, someone would laugh gently, before relating some extraordinary tale about a \u00a36 pint. </p> <p>I'd also had to book a hotel of course, a process that involved much fraught clicking between <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com\">TripAdvisor</a>, hotel websites, and this <a href=\"http://www.xe.com/ucc/\">currency converter</a>, trying to stretch the budget to cover anything other than the unappealingly named <a href=\"http://www.cabinn.com/english/kbh/city/city.html\">Cabinn City budget hotel</a>, around \u00a360-a-night for the room only; or the private rooms at \"designer\" youth hostel, <a href=\"http://www.danhostel.dk/content/us/hostel_details?HostelId=144\">Copenhagen City</a>, rooms \u00a380+. In the end, I said, \"sod it\", whispered a short prayer to the goddess Visa, and booked the nice but hardly mind-blowing <a href=\"http://www.avenuehotel.dk/index.php?id=1\">Avenue</a> for the-relative-bargain-price-of-\u00a3120-a-night. What can I say? I'm a holiday-maker, not a traveller. There's no pleasure to be had in roughing it. </p> <p>Even after all that, however, nothing can fully prepare you for Denmark proper. Vaguely you know alcohol is going to be expensive (don't they heavily tax it in Scandinavian countries to stop everyone from drifting into suicidal alcoholism during the winter?), but it's not until you've handed over <a href=\"http://www.sebastopol.dk\">\u00a313 for two pints</a> that you start to appreciate what everyone was warning you about. I kept smiling at the bar, staggered to a table outside, and collapsed like a man who'd just been hit by a big truck heavily loaded with \"reality\". Good as the beers brewed at Carlsberg's Jacobsen microbrewery are, it's very difficult to enjoy your first pint when you know you can't afford a second.</p> <p>Or anything else for that matter. Because, as it soon became clear, everything in Copenhagen (except cigarettes) is expensive. Cornetto? \u00a32.50. Small bottle of mineral water? \u00a32. Croissant and coffee? \u00a36. At dinner, you're talking at least \u00a325 for a good, but not exceptional, main meal and a glass of wine, and you can easily spend a lot more. The Metro is ultra-efficient, but it costs over \u00a32 to go a couple of stops, while a return ticket to go across the \u00d6resund Bridge to Malm\u00f6, a journey that takes just 30 minutes, is over \u00a317. So much for the myth of competitively priced European public transport. </p> <p>However, if you're only in Copenhagen for a few days - who could afford more? - all is not lost. If you're happy to simply wander around, and get a feel for the city, which I am, then you can laze around in Copenhagen's many beautiful parks, or gawp at iconic waterfront architecture, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_Larsen\"> Henning Larsen</a>'s Opera House, for free. Similarly, it won't cost you a penny to have a look, if you must, at the Little Mermaid; tour the fantastic <a href=\"http://www.frihedsmuseet.dk/sw23424.asp\">Museum of Danish Resistance</a>; or visit that one-time hippy Shangri-la, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown_Christiania\"> Christiana</a>. The latter is a pale, distinctly moody shadow of its former self; one ringed with police without, and full of very serious looking drug dealers within. It's kind of like <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=R8PGWJ6LuOo\"> The Wire's Hamsterdam</a>, only with Bob Marley beach towels and vegan falafel stalls.</p> <p>If you've the tenacity to get off the tourist trail you can even eat and drink, I wouldn't say cheaply, but at London prices. Luckily, I was staying on the edge of lively, grungy N\u00f6rrebro. It's a student/creative enclave with a large immigrant population and, consequently, it's relatively cheap. Keke's Kokken takeaway (Rantzausgade 10) - excellent meatballs, brilliant zingy fresh salads, eat your fill for about \u00a36 - was a lifesaver. Meanwhile, the beers at nearby indie-arty bar, <a href=\"http://www.tjili.dk\">Tjili Pop</a>, start at around \u00a33.</p> <p>Even in town, seek and ye shall find a pint for under \u00a34. The hunt led me to <a href=\"http://studenterhuset.com\">Copenhagen's student union bar</a>, which is fine as long as you don't mind that night's band endlessly sound-checking in the background. Meanwhile, at the friendly, no frills <a href=\"http://www.ivebeenthere.co.uk/tips/10190\">Moose bar</a>, during happy hour, you can get two pints for less than a fiver. Obviously, it was packed. </p> <p>The point is, no matter where you are, no matter how expensive your destination, there are always coping strategies. There are always cheaper bolt-holes to get drunk in; there is always good free cultural stuff to do. If you know where to find it, that is.</p> <p>So, in the spirit of sharing, we want your tips. Where can we find a comfortable bed and a good, cheap meal in Moscow? Can it really be true, as a colleague insists, that you can pretty much camp for free anywhere in Norway? What do Tokyo's financially-challenged shop workers and students do for entertainment and culture? Does Reykjavik have to be ruinous? Can you visit Zurich without bankrupting yourself? Where does the innocent tourist find a bona fide bargain in London?</p>",
  "<p>Eleven tourists and eight guides kidnapped 10 days ago in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt\">Egypt</a> have been freed, local media reported today.</p> <p>The country's state news agency and television station did not give details of where or how the group had been freed, saying only that the five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian were in good health.

The dead included the leader of the group, whom Khaled identified as a Chadian named Bakhit.</p> <p>German officials had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/egypt.middleeast\">demanding millions of dollars</a> in ransom.</p> <p>The vast majority of Egypt's 9 million tourists each year visit pharaonic sites along the Nile or Red Sea beach resorts, far from the Western Desert and the Gilf al-Kebir.

  "<p>In modern Britain, who do we think we are? Or, more precisely, to whom do we give our allegiance \u2013 Allah, the Pope, our parents' country of origin, Britain, Scotland, Arsenal, feminism, the Territorial Army, the pull of Prada?</p> <p>We apparently embrace the idea of community, but what creates a sense of social cohesion and can immigration fracture it? Does anyone define themselves according to their class any more? Do the newly arrived have to behave more British than the British or can they retain many of their own customs and values and still expect a welcome? Is there really a crisis in British identity?</p> <p>These are tricky questions to pose \u2013 and the answers are even harder to extricate from the myths and propaganda and media hype around immigration and the pessimistic public narrative that currently prevails in some quarters. One that says everyone is out for themselves, the individual rules in isolated splendour. While \"they\", the foreigners, are rapidly taking over, changing what it means to be British. </p> <p>Mistrust is now the setting for all discussions around identity, immigration, allegiance and social cohesion. Government constantly told us that immigration was under control; numbers have subsequently proved otherwise. The plight of sections of the white working class and the lack of progress in health, education and employment fuels division and discontent.</p> <p>Given the level of suspicion, the findings of <a href=\"www.identities.org.uk\">Identities and Social Action</a>, a five-year \u00a34m research programme, funded by the <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/index.aspx\">Economic and Social Research Council</a> might be easily dismissed; washed away by prejudice. And that would be a pity. </p> <p>A precis of the programme's research gleaned from 25 projects, conducted by universities in the UK and abroad, was given at a one day conference in London this week. Some of the studies were predictable, as was the justifiable charge that the material was filtered through the lenses of predominantly white middle class researchers, which is difficult to avoid given who goes to university. This criticism was made by panel member <a href=\"http://www.shaunbailey.co.uk/\">Shaun Bailey</a>, who personifies how multiple identities are increasingly the norm. In his case: black; second-generation British; originally from Jamaica; Muslim; and the Tory candidate for Hammersmith. </p> <p>What the findings of Identities and Social Action flag up strongly, if unsurprisingly, is that if the government really wants to encourage social cohesion then immigration has to be controlled more fairly and efficiently. It also has to invest support in both white deprived communities and the migrants who are already here. (One study, for instance, of Somali young people in Sheffield underlines how the lack of adequate help in education pushes them towards either Muslim support systems and religious schools or towards offending.) The government also has to adopt some unpopular policies. It could begin by banning all single faith schools.</p> <p>Integration is a huge challenge in the 21st century. People have a right to develop their own sense of identity \u2013 but what if that conflicts with some of the values of the host community? The position of women in some immigrant societies inevitably comes to mind, an issue covered in the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4828349.ece\">The Times on Friday.</a> </p> <p>A report to be published next month by the <a href=\"http://www.islamicpluralism.org/\">Centre for Islamic Pluralism</a> alleges that some imams \"turn a blind eye\" to beatings, rape and abuse of women. On the other hand, an immigrant rooted in a family with a different culture and habits and aspirations from the host community may also pay a personal price when endeavouring to mix in with whites. </p> <p>In one longitudinal study of immigrant children, conducted as part of the Identities programme, 400 Asian and white children were followed in 20 primary schools for 12 months and their levels of well being, self-esteem and social acceptance recorded. On average, the school populations were 40% Asian and 60% white. (Unfortunately, no research was carried out in schools or neighbourhoods where the host population are the minority.)</p> <p>What the study discovered is that the more diverse the school, the greater the sense of well being, self-esteem and mutual friendship and the fewer the peer problems and hostility among both Asian and white children. It's not astrophysics: the more positive contact people from different communities have with each other, the greater the understanding, tolerance and possibilities for mutual benefit \u2013 as the threat of \"difference\" is diminished. The study also found that the Asian children were slightly more emotionally fragile perhaps because of the effort of straddling two cultures and experiencing discrimination as they tried to fit in.</p> <p>If contact works and single faith schools operate against that message, reducing opportunities for friendships and accentuating difference why not, in the name of the greater good, insist that all state education must be secular? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.progressive-governance.net/uploadedFiles/Publications/Publications/Immigration%20and%20Integration%20final.pdf\">In Rethinking Immigration and Integration: A New Centre Left Agenda</a>, Dr Alessandra Buonfino points out that much of the challenge of immigration and integration lies in how government and communities handle and shape multiple loyalties; assimilation isn't the solution.</p> <p>Some of the identities and Social Action findings support her view. For instance, one study established that while there is a long-term decline in the proportion of people who think of themselves as British, no \"crisis of British identity\" could be found. Almost everyone expressed a dual identity (British and Welsh say or Muslim and British). The group with the greatest lack of attachment is not those who follow Islam but young black Caribbeans born in Britain. (All young people feel less sense of belonging than older generations). </p> <p>Research in the Identities programme also established that while we identify ourselves by class when pushed (still influenced by father's occupation), we no longer have a sense of class allegiance that, for example, dictates our choice of political party, a change that accelerated under New Labour. As a result, we are less inclined to turn out at election time; we have become a nation of floating voters, shopping for the best deal.</p> <p>However, individualism doesn't entirely rule. New collective identities are being forged among smaller groups, for instance, environmental and anti-war movements, graduates, feminists and young people, with around 60% in each group feeling \"commonality\" with fellow members. More optimistically, the Identities and Social Action research also says that the emergence of these newer collective social groupings may have implications for protest politics and alternative forms of political participation, perhaps heralding the rise of the \"critical citizen\". Critical citizens whom, presumably, are highly diverse in terms of colour, creed, faith, class, origins and football allegiance \u2013 but who share values and at least one common goal. </p> <p>Paradoxically, most white people in the UK have little contact with minorities while, according to Identities and Social Action, we suffer from an \"information deficit\". Very few of us really know who is coming into the UK, who is leaving and who is getting what in terms of jobs, support and benefits. In the absence of knowledge, we imagine the worst.</p> <p>Sadly it is from this potentially poison well that politicians prefer to draw especially when their own careers look shaky or an election approaches. Why draw on the results of a lengthy and expensive research project that examines the identities, allegiences and sense of social cohesion among the UK's existing and would-be citizens when the exploitation of fear can bring so much richer electoral rewards? </p>",
  "<p>Breast is best. It's a phrase few nutritionists would disagree with, government agencies endorse it and natural child-rearing types say it all the time. They just don't usually say it about ice cream. </p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.wsoctv.com/news/17539538/detail.html\">if PETA get their way</a> in what we'll charitably assume for a moment isn't just an imaginative publicity stunt, one of the leading high-end manufacturers would be serving up tubs of iced-mummy-juice. But would you eat it?<br><br>It is, of course, an argument that is being held in lots of different ways at the moment: why should it be considered normal to feed babies with cows milk rather than donated human milk (as talked about in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/23/kate.garraway.breast.milk\">Weekend magazine's interview with Kate Garraway</a> last month)? And isn't it a bit weird drinking something filled with the kind of hormones that make baby cows grow up into big strong cows anyway? And that's before you get into the humane treatment bit that PETA are most worried about. </p> <p>But that all aside - perhaps spurred on by the Kate Garraway interview (well, probably not, but, you know, maybe?) there seem to have been a lot more breastmilk articles in the last few days.</p> <p>Sadly, the one that got everyone excited last week - the news that a restauranteur in Switzerland was planning on adding some breast-milk recipes to his menu that he'd developed when his own children were born - has ended sourly. After a few days trying to work out whether it was legal or not, as weirdly no one had thought to mention whether it was a banned foodstuff or not before, some crazy officials have decided that it's not alright after all and nipped it in the bud. Ahem. Apparently they have no way of proving how fresh it is and perhaps something about pasteurisation, and all of that - it's health and safety culture gorn maaaad, I tell you. </p> <p>But would people have liked it? The chef in question was deeply convinced by his recipes - he said that all you had to do was add a bit of whipping cream to correct the consistency, but otherwise they were completely kosher. Sorry, kosher as in the cockney sense of 'valid' rather than the correct technical sense. (In fact, if someone could clear up whether cooking with breastmilk would be kosher or not, I'd be very interested to hear it. Is it?)</p> <p>Still, they're sounding doubtful at the moment - a spokesperson for Ben &amp; Jerry's said that although human milk was a marvellous thing for babies they thought they would probably be sticking with moo-cows.</p> <p>But it's the concept that interests me. There are some incredible possibilities: I haven't been blessed enough to expel small people from my undercarriage as yet, but people of my acquaintance who <em>have</em> assure me that you have to be careful what you eat and drink because the flavour of it carries through into the milk you feed your baby. Or something. Surely this could be utilised in ice cream production? Surely we could just get the ice-cream mothers to eat nothing but strawberries and then be able to call it 'all natural flavour!' (though obviously Rum &amp; Raisin would be a bit of an ethical dilemma if she was also still feeding a little baby as well as going into industrial production).</p> <p>But also - would people feel comfortable eating it at all? While in many ways it's surely as natural - if not more natural - than drinking any other animal's milk (trying to imagine suckling directly from a cow at this point helps when thinking about it, I find) reactions to the idea of it being used in restaurant food or ice cream were generally not good. Is it because it's a bodily fluid and it belongs to some one else? Because it's not like cooking with snot, is it? It's quite different. Isn't it? Does it feel like cannibalism? Is that why people feel funny about it?</p> <p>I'm at a disadvantage here, because not only have I never been milked, no one's ever offered me a drink of theirs, either (you know, you pop round for a dinner party, they ask if they can get you anything - wine? Beer? Nipple-runoff?) so not only do I not know how it tastes, I don't know how I would react to the reality of being presented with the choice. Though I have to admit that my gut instinct is 'churny' - meaning possibly I wouldn't be that keen. But I have no idea. Do you? </p> <p>Have you tried it? Your own, or someone else's? What does it taste like, please? And if this was a perfectly pleasant and not weird experience at all, then if you came across it on a restaurant menu or the ingredients list of your ice cream, would you be fine with that?</p>"
