  "<p>It ranks alongside the worst excuses in football. Having failed to sign the experienced striker he was chasing in the final hours of the summer transfer window, Damien Comolli, the Tottenham sporting director, blamed \"agent activity\".</p> <p>Yes, the Frenchman would have got away with it if it hadn't been for those meddling agents, the very people he must nurture to help press transfer deals over the line, which is, essentially, the purpose of his employment. Comolli had not delivered but hang on, those agents, eh? What can you do?</p> <p>\"I am particularly disappointed that we were unable to make one additional signing, another experienced striker,\" he said in a prepared statement (is there any other medium through which Tottenham directors communicate with supporters?).</p> <p>\"The deal was agreed but fell through in the final moments due to agent activity,\" he went on. \"It is all too often that judgments are made on how these deals are or are not concluded and the reality and the reasoning that happens is often very different and highly unpredictable.\"</p> <p>Comolli is on thin ice, his record under increasing scrutiny. Even Daniel Levy, his chairman, said in another prepared statement: \"I cannot deny that I share with them [the supporters] a disappointment that we couldn't add further to replace attacking options.\" Worryingly for Comolli, Levy is not a man who generally carries the can.</p> <p>Tottenham insist that the signing of players is a committee effort, that Comolli and Juande Ramos, the manager, have an equal say and Levy, the chief holder of the purse strings, has his input too. But during the final fraught weeks of the summer transfer window, which coincided with the team's poor start to the new season - their 2-1 home defeat by Aston Villa on Monday kept them rooted to the foot of the table - the tensions have not been difficult to discern.</p> <p>Comolli has been guilty of some dubious purchases - Younes Kaboul, Kevin-Prince Boateng and Darren Bent at a combined \u00a330m in the summer of last year are perhaps his poorest - yet the policy of deadline-day brinkmanship, of staring down rival clubs to wring every last penny from a deal, predates him.</p> <p>That is Levy's domain and it is he who accepts or signs the cheques. Never mind the collateral damage of the Dimitar Berbatov affair, he was delighted to have extracted \u00a330.75m from United for the Bulgarian, and he could not turn down Liverpool's \u00a320m for Robbie Keane. The \u00a316m Sunderland offered for Steed Malbranque, Pascal Chimbonda and Teemu Tainio represented further good business in his eyes.</p> <p>When he is in the market for a player, Levy, the ceaseless haggler, will not pay over the odds. He authorised the walking away from a series of deals last month, including the one at the 11th hour for the extra striker that the club needed, believed to be Real Zaragoza's Sergio Garc\u00eda, who was eventually bought by Real Betis. Financial imperatives appear to be the bottom line; the fallout from missed opportunities or damaging sagas must simply be man-managed, however problematic that might be. And like every good politician, Levy tends to have somebody else in front of him when the bullets are flying.</p> <p>Ramos is not an outspoken man. His forward defensive in press conferences would make Geoffrey Boycott grunt appreciatively. Yet he has repeatedly railed at the way that the business end of the summer market overlaps with the beginning of the season, calling it \"one of the most unpleasant things that currently exist in the game\", and, more pertinently, has questioned why Tottenham insisted upon leaving important pieces of business until the very last moment. \"The ideal situation is that you get your squad settled early and you work with all the players in the pre-season period,\" he said.</p> <p>When the dust had settled on another helter-skelter deadline day at White Hart Lane, Berbatov and his strike partner Keane had added to the departure of another free-scoring forward, Jermain Defoe, in January. In their stead, Roman Pavlyuchenko arrived from Spartak Moscow and Fraizer Campbell joined on loan from Manchester United. With the admission that they had failed to get another body in up front, it is impossible to argue that Ramos's squad is not weaker in this department and a host of creative midfielders - Tottenham signed Luka Modric, Giovani dos Santos and David Bentley - does not redress the imbalance.</p> <p>Moreover, as the midfielder Malbranque, one of Tottenham's best players last season, was allowed to leave, the club lost further Premier League experience. Modric and Giovani have appeared bewildered at the frenetic pace of the English game. They will doubtless come good and, in time, the disparate parts of the team will gel to produce consistent performances. But it will take time and Tottenham can ill afford to lose further ground in the Premier League over the next few weeks.</p> <p>Roll on the January transfer window.</p> <h2>Slow starters</h2> <p><strong>This is the third consecutive season Spurs have lost three of their four opening Premier League games</strong></p> <p><strong>2006-2007 Finished 5th</strong></p> <p>P <strong>4 </strong>W <strong>1 </strong>D <strong>0 </strong>L <strong>3 </strong>F <strong>2 </strong>A <strong>5 </strong>Pts <strong>3</strong> </p> <p><strong>2007-2008 Finished 11th</strong></p> <p>P <strong>4 </strong>W <strong>1 </strong>D <strong>0 </strong>L <strong>3 </strong>F <strong>5 </strong>A <strong>5 </strong>Pts <strong>3</strong> </p> <p><strong>2008-2009 Currently bottom</strong></p> <p>P <strong>4 </strong>W <strong>0 </strong>D <strong>1 </strong>L <strong>3 </strong>F <strong>4 </strong>A <strong>7 </strong>Pts <strong>1</strong></p>",
  "<p>They clutched union flags and held pictures of the Queen, and some wore rows of medals across their breasts. But the words on the banners that they unfurled spelled out their protest: \"Gurkhas Won 13 VCs But Still Unwanted By UK.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, hundreds of Gurkha veterans gathered outside the high court in London to mark the beginning of a battle against the British government's refusal to grant settlement in the United Kingdom to those who retired from the regiment before 1997.</p> <p>The actor Joanna Lumley told the gathering: \"My father served alongside the Gurkhas for 30 years. I am a daughter of the regiment. He would be absolutely overwhelmed with shame and fury that we have behaved this way to the Gurkhas, our most loyal and constant friends. I am never ashamed to be British but I am ashamed of the behaviour of the British legal system towards these brave men. We have discriminated against them dreadfully. It is a stain on our relationship.\"</p> <p>Lumley rallied them with the words \"ayo Gurkhali\", the traditional battle cry meaning \"Gurkhas go forward\". Many veterans see this as their final fight: five have died in the time that it has taken for their appeals to be heard.</p> <p>The government argues that since the Gurkhas' regimental headquarters were in Hong Kong until 1997, those who retired before then would not have developed significant ties to the UK. Five Gurkhas who have been refused visas on this basis are spearheading what will be a test case for almost 2,000 other similar refusals. </p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-335160651\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1788670284_gdn-nat-080611-jd-gurkas-final-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>The Gurkhas, who have fought and died for the British for almost two centuries, insist that their ties are strong. Arguing their case, Edward Fitzgerald QC told the court that the Home Office's claim that those who retired before 1997 could not have built up close ties to the UK was not rational. </p> <p>\"To say this is to ignore the history of the Gurkhas. And it is to ignore the special debt this country owes to all Gurkhas, past and present, whatever their brigade's location, and whatever their date of discharge,\" he said. Gurkha soldiers - 13 of whom had won Victoria Crosses for bravery in battle - \"past and present, all alike have strong ties to this country\". He went on: \"Their long and dedicated service links them inextricably to the people of this country and creates a debt of gratitude and honour. What matters is the fact of service, not the location of service. </p> <p>\"However distant their country of origin, whatever the location of their headquarters at a particular moment in history, however remote the battlefields on which they fought and risked their lives and shed their blood, all the Gurkha soldiers, past and present, were fighting for this country. This gives them all equally 'strong ties' to this country - to its life and history.\"</p> <p>Soldiers recruited from the Commonwealth to the British army have a right to settle in Britain after four years of service anywhere in the world, under a policy known as the Armed Forces Concession (AFC). Fitzgerald said the AFC \"elevates three years in UK barracks beyond the defence of Britain abroad\".</p> <p>Present in court, in their wheelchairs, were two Gurkha soldiers who were awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery. Tulbahadur Pun, 85, was decorated for charging the enemy alone and enabling his platoon to move forward. Lachiman Gurung lost a hand when, after lobbing back a number of enemy grenades, the third one he threw exploded in his hand - he continued to fire at the enemy for four hours. Pun was awarded a settlement visa only after a special concession followed a high-profile campaign; Gurung does not have one.</p> <p>In a hearing expected to last two days, Fitzgerald will argue that Gurkhas have been discriminated against under the Race Relations Act and Article 14 of the European convention, which bars discrimination on grounds of race, national or social origin.</p> <p>Outside the court, Folkestone Liberal Democrat councillor Peter Carroll, who has led the campaign for Gurkhas to be allowed settlement in the UK, told the Gurkhas: \"If this case was heard in the hearts and minds of the British people, the case would be won already.\"</p>",
  "<p>John Matshikiza, who has died aged 54 following a heart attack, was one of those polymaths who South Africa has an odd way of throwing up: film and stage actor, poet, journalist, broadcaster and political activist, he seemed equally comfortable in each of these roles. Though he could be critical of the way the country was run, his presence was somehow reassuring, so that in his company it was tempting to focus on the healthier aspects of post-apartheid South Africa. But it remains a violent place, and earlier this year he was assaulted during a carjacking outside his home. According to his family, he never fully recovered.</p> <p>Matshikiza was born in the Johannesburg township of Sophiatown, which was soon after demolished to make way for the white suburb of Triomf (Triumph). His father, Todd Matshikiza, wrote the music and some of the lyrics for the highly acclaimed King Kong musical, which went on to launch the careers of singer Miriam Makeba and trumpeter Hugh Masekela. He was also a founder writer for Drum, the pioneering, black-led magazine edited by Anthony Sampson, who was John's godfather.</p> <p>In 1961, soon after the Sharpeville massacre, the banning of the African National Congress (ANC) and other political organisations and a state crackdown on the media, Todd went on tour to Britain with King Kong, with his family following. In 1964, they went to Lusaka, Zambia, where Todd became head of broadcasting services for the newly independent country; he died in 1968. John returned to London to study at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, Swiss Cottage, and, after training with the Royal Shakespeare Company, worked for the Glasgow Citizens Theatre company. </p> <p>He then combined stage acting in London with activism for the ANC: in the early 1970s he helped form Mayibuye, its cultural arm. He also lived in the US, Amsterdam and various African countries including Senegal, where he was culture director of the Gor\u00e9e Institute. In the 1980s he began to develop a reputation both as a film actor - notably in Cry Freedom (1987), Mandela (also 1987, a film for television in which he played Walter Sisulu), Leon Schuster's There's a Zulu on My Stoep (1993) and Hijack Stories (2000) - and as a lyrical poet. One of his earliest published poems, And I Watch It in Mandela (1974), was recently republished in a Nelson Mandela anthology: </p> <p>It is not for the safety of silence<br>That this man has opened his arms to lead<br>The strength of his words hangs in the air <br>As the strength in his eyes remains on the sky; <br>And the years of impatient waiting draw on<br>While this man burns to clear the smoke in the air.<br>There is fire here,<br>Which no prison<br>Can kill in this man;<br>And I watch it in Mandela.</p> <p>But his poetry went well beyond the laudatory, and achieved critical acclaim. Published works include South Where Her Feet Cool on Ice (1981) and Prophets in the Black Sky (1986).</p> <p>When Mandela was released in 1990, Matshikiza decided to return to the country he had not seen for 30 years. \"I was in London, with my mother and my daughter and my partner and we were all just bowled over by what was happening,\" he said afterwards. \"We'd been waiting all of our lives for this. That is all I can say. It was the whole of my life.\"</p> <p>By 1991 he was back in Johannesburg, where he soon won several prizes for journalism - he was a columnist for the Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper, wrote for Business Day and The Weekender, presented a BBC radio series and contributed to several British and American publications. His occasional returns to film included Wah-Wah (2005), Richard E Grant's exploration of the pre-independence Swaziland of his youth.</p> <p>Matshikiza's friend Ronald Suresh Roberts described him as \"the gentle ex-columnist\", because he tended to avoid the most pressing debates within the South African media, taking a left-field approach. In one Mail &amp; Guardian column, he wrote of the irony of South Africa becoming \"the great white hope of the black diaspora\". He went on: \"People speak comprehensible English here. Telephones work. There's a black president, a largely black cabinet, black empowerment and a black economic elite which, even though they may show signs of moral confusion and fallibility, nevertheless symbolise a significant advance in the worldwide profile of the black world.\"</p> <p>His great strength as a journalist was that he was never seduced by offers of power or patronage and was never afraid to poke barbs at the new elite. Another friend, Ismail Mahomed, said: \"John was betrayed in many ways by our new democracy simply because he refused to fall into the comfort zone of being a 'returned exile'. John was unafraid to speak out against a new breed of African opportunists just as much as he was unafraid to challenge old-style racists. I'll sorely miss his brilliance.\"</p> <p>Matshikiza is survived by his mother Esme, who lives in Cape Town, his ex-wife Eva Kavuma, and his two daughters Lindiwe and Fubi.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Matshikiza, actor, poet and journalist, born 1954; died September 15 2008</p>",
  "<h2>Trying times for deniers</h2> <p>Rightwing commentators and climate change deniers have gone wild at the trial verdict that cleared Greenpeace direct action protesters of committing a criminal offence. Top marks to Richard Littlejohn, in the Daily Mail, who hopelessly confuses climate change with the ozone layer in his rant, and compounds his ignorance by saying \"the ice caps are not melting\". </p> <p>But a gold star goes to Melanie Phillips, writing in her Spectator blog, who calls the Greenpeace action \"environmental terrorism\". Phillips knows enough climate science to state that James Hansen, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies and probably the world's foremost atmospheric scientist, is \"totally wrong\". Green protesters must also be reeling to hear, courtesy of Brendan O'Neill, a former Marxist now editing Spiked, that far from waging war against uncaring governments, they are now the \"militant wing of the elite\". More worrying is weatherman Anthony Watts, who is now leading a movement in the US to have Hansen fired from Nasa for \"siding with vandalism\" and \"violating the code of ethics\", and even \"misusing his position\" when he appeared as a Greenpeace defence witness. Watts is a meteorologist at KPAY-AM, which is affiliated with Fox News, the TV station that has led the US right's assault on global warming science. </p> <h2>Nuclear fallout</h2> <p>E.ON, the German energy company that owns Kingsnorth power station, was keeping its head down after the Greenpeace verdict, but it's leaked out that it is now planning to build a nuclear reactor on the banks of the river Severn at Oldbury, Gloucestershire. Nearby communities need not expect anything too soon. The company wants a European pressurised reactor, the kind now under construction at Olkiluoto, Finland, and Flamanville, northern France. Both projects are entangled in construction problems; foundations have been laid with the wrong mix of concrete, and welds have been wrongly applied. Olkiluoto is now two-and-a-half years behind schedule and \u00a31bn overspent. Flamanville is six months behind schedule.</p> <h2>Against the grain</h2> <p>Back in 1999, it emerged that Monsanto had to ban GM food in its canteen at its High Wycombe HQ, Buckinghamshire. Now Eco Soundings hears that Hugh Grant, the company's CEO, has turned to organic food. Here is an extract of Grant on American public radio two weeks ago.</p> <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you worry at all about the rise of organic foods and people being more interested in more natural produce and product? <strong>Grant:</strong> No, no, I don't. I think if you walk through any supermarket a portion of that shelf is going to be organic, and that's fine. And a big piece of that shelf is driven by quality and affordability. A lot of the organic material is still pretty expensive. <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you ever buy organic food yourself? <strong>Grant:</strong> Yeah, I do.</p> <h2>Forest of figures</h2> <p>Here's hedge fund veteran and former deputy chairman of the giant Man Group, Stanley Fink, doing the maths in front of Prince Charles, Sir David Attenborough and the City at the rainforest dinner last week: \"On European markets, the right to emit one tonne of CO2 trades today at about $30; it has been estimated that, by 2020, this price could rise to $80. Every hectare of rainforest stores a carbon equivalent to 500 tonnes of CO2. This means that each hectare of rainforest left alive is potentially a $15,000 asset - some 75 times more than its land value. Put simply, no crop can match the value per hectare of rainforest. With an estimated 610bn tonnes of CO2 sequestered by our tropical rainforests, a vast $18tn business opportunity is before us. Even paying a 2% yield on the carbon value of one hectare left alive would produce a higher return than converting it into ranch land.\" </p> <h2>Welsh rarity</h2> <p>There's a new TV ad for Welsh lamb, and it's set in driving rain in the Brecon Beacons. So what's unusual? Weirdly, there was no rain in Wales when it was shot. Blade Runner director Ridley Scott's London film production company had to bring in rain machines.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year, while writing a documentary on Kivalina, one of several Alaskan barrier-reef islands slipping into the sea, and among the world's worst ecological disasters, I stumbled on the state's 44-year-old governor Sarah Palin. Even then, as she posed in the snow-covered wilderness beside her seaplane and fresh animal kills, rumours swirled around her that she might be a vice-presidential contender. In an extraordinary twist of fate, this sharp-shooter and former small-town beauty queen, who until two years ago was mayor of her tiny hometown, Wasilla, Alaska, has become the American right's golden girl.</p> <p>Ever since the Palin family soap drama hit prime time, the mainstream media has focused on digging up the dirt, but there have been few mentions about her environmental history. Palin is governor of a state that has seen the most dramatic effects of a warming world, yet until last week she remained unconvinced that climate change is in any way man-made. \"The jury's still out on that one,\" she said, just days after the recent hurricanes and tropical storms were making their way across the Atlantic, offering a glimpse of the climate chaos that may be left for future generations.</p> <p>Palin, in a recent interview with Newsmax.com, accepted that warming would affect Alaska \"more than any other state, because of our location\". But she added: \"I'm not one though who would attribute it to being manmade.\" Such a position would put her to the right even of President Bush and some of the oil companies - and it is now scaring the international community. </p> <p>Last Friday, she finally conceded that the problem might be man-made. In an interview with ABC television, she said: \"I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now.\"</p> <p>Chris Mooney, author of The Republican War on Science, says: \"The irony of a climate change denier being based in Alaska is breathtaking. The state is warming faster than practically anywhere else, with winter temperatures up by 6F since 1950. Visitors to Alaska can see the evidence all around, from drunken forests of semi-fallen trees and sunken roads, all unseated by the melting of the permafrost, to unprecedented forest fires.\"</p> <p>For conservation and animal protection groups, Palin has long been considered an enemy. According to Greenpeace, \"Palin has the most anti-environment records of any governor in the US. She has supported oil drilling in some of the most ecologically sensitive areas in Alaska, even when it meant sacrificing polar bears and beluga whales.\"</p> <p>Only this month, Palin told the Republican party convention: \"We Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas. And take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska, we've got lots of both.\"</p> <p>Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth US, says: \"Sarah Palin's record is not extensive - just two years ago she was the mayor of a city of fewer than 10,000 people - but what it indicates is troubling. She has been a friend of Big Oil, opposing a windfall profits tax on the oil industry that could fund affordable clean energy for more Americans. Oh, and Palin's husband works for BP.\"</p> <p><strong>Literally drowning</strong></p> <p>Palin is, if nothing else, consistent. She tried to sue the US government to derail the listing of polar bears as a threatened species, fearing that it would get in the way of oil and gas development - this as the ice melts under their paws and they are literally drowning.</p> <p>She then wrote a piece for the New York Times, saying that these \"magnificent cuddly white bears are doing just fine and don't need our protection. If the ice melts, they'll adapt to living on land\". That is a contention most scientists found reckless, given that polar bears have shown little ability to feed on land.</p> <p>Palin also questioned the scientific consensus that global warming is melting the Arctic sea ice, but failed to mention oil drilling or the routine oil spills that, over the years, have destroyed the ecology of nearly 18,000 acres of wildlife and marine habitat.</p> <p>\"We need to drill, drill, drill,\" she told the Wall Street Journal recently, and she is in the forefront of moves to exploit the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). \"If Alaskans can't do that on our own land, then the nation is going to be in a world of hurt, depending on dangerous foreign powers.\" She argues that \"ANWR is only the size of the Los Angeles airport, and drilling there isn't environmentally destructive\".</p> <p>In oil-rich Alaska, that goes down well. Many residents support drilling in the 7.7m-hectare refuge on the north coast, an area considered by conservationists as a treasured wild place. \"If you're not for opening ANWR, in the state of Alaska, you couldn't get elected dog-catcher,\" says former Alaska state representative Ray Metcalfe, a Republican-turned-Democrat who supports Barack Obama.</p> <p>Alaska is wildly beautiful and sparsely populated, with abundant natural resources that more recently have started to become scarce. In her two years as governor, Palin has got her own pleasure out of its wildlife. There are photos of her posing with the bloodied carcasses of moose, caribou, elk and grizzly bear.</p> <p>This summer, she reached new lows in the eyes of conservationists by approving the killing of black bear sows with cubs. The year before, she put a $150 bounty on wolf paws to entice hunters to kill more of these elusive wild dogs. She also spent $400,000 of public money to defeat an initiative that would have banned aerial hunting of wolves for sport.</p> <p>\"Palin is an environmental horror story,\" claims conservationist Dave Chandler. \"Alaska's out-of-control wolf slaughter is pretty brutal. When she approved the killing of all wolves in the Cold Bay area, state officials illegally killed 14 wolf pups - after killing their mothers - by dragging them out of their dens and shooting them.\"</p> <p>When environmentalists or concerned citizens from the other 48 states (where wolves are protected) dared to object to the idea of a hunting free-for-all, Palin protested that they didn't \"understand rural Alaska\". </p> <p>The state that Palin governs consists of 660,000 people, with a minority that loves the wilderness and is animals, and a majority - mostly Republican - that appears to want to squeeze all the cash it can get out of the state before the oil dries up, the fish die and the wildlife disappears.</p> <p>Alaskans, who annually receive oil-royalty dividends - $1,654 each last year - think of themselves as fiercely independent, but in fact are completely dependent on oil. As in many resource-rich economies, this has tended to encouraged corruption and bad governance, and a culture of impunity among lawmakers. After a four-year FBI investigation, several Alaskan businessmen and politicians - including the state's US senator, Ted Stevens - have been convicted of making and taking bribes to keep a tax on oil profits at an artificially low 20%. Palin herself is facing one abuse-of-power investigation for allegedly using her position to settle family scores by exacting retribution against her former brother-in-law, a state trooper, and firing officials who would not toe the line.</p> <p><strong>Selling out</strong></p> <p>Palin claims to be embarrassed by Alaska's national reputation as a corrupt backwater. Yet critics say she is in the pocket of Big Oil and is maintaining the state's tradition of selling out its natural resources. She swept into the governor's office as a self-styled renegade, promising to shake up the status quo, but has fallen in line with the Republican political establishment who have traditionally served the interests of multinationals and their hunting, fishing, mining and oil-drilling buddies at the expense of the environment.</p> <p>John McCain's choice may reassure hardline Republicans, but for many Americans she is a frightening prospect: an anti-environmentalist who puts special interests above science and whose policies make the Bush administration look progressive; a pro-life hunter who opposes abortion, even in the cases of rape and incest, yet kills other living creatures for entertainment; and a Christian fundamentalist who thinks that the Iraq war is \"God's task for America\". </p> <p>She certainly stirs strong emotions. As former New York mayor Ed Koch said: \"She scares the hell out of me.\"</p>",
  "<p>A government-funded \"college\" for teenage asylum seekers - which the Home Office hopes will save money and increase deportation rates - is due to open this month. The Bournemouth-based Alpha Project: Caring By Preparing For Return will target unaccompanied Afghan male asylum seekers aged 16 and 17, treating them as \"foreign students\" in order to prepare them for deportation. It will take referrals from Croydon council, where the UK Borders Agency (UKBA) is based, and will be run by a Christian faith-based refugee support and education organisation, International Care Network (ICN). </p> <p>A residential facility with 15 places has been prepared, and the boys will receive education, such as English lessons. Later, they will move into shared houses in the community. The aim, says Andrew Muir, ICN chief executive, is to prepare these boys \"mentally, emotionally and practically for return to their own country\" through project workers acting as \"good parents\". He says: \"The philosophy that we've got is that good parenting matures children and makes them more robust. Predominantly, we'll be preparing the boys by providing a loving, caring, secure community for them.\"</p> <p>The Home Office says the objectives of the pilot scheme include saving money on leaving-care costs and other support services, and increasing deportation rates. According to its figures, just 13% of unaccompanied young asylum seekers were given leave to remain in 2007. </p> <p>Muir says ICN decided to work with UKBA on this scheme because it believes it is better for young people to be realistic about the slim chance of being granted asylum. An ICN briefing states: \"If we do not come up with solutions the public find acceptable, then they will come up with ones we find unacceptable - that is, increased detention of children.\"</p> <p>The ICN briefing goes on: \"All of us would rather send a trickle of educated young men back to slowly change a country, rather than an army to enforce change - but it is a longer-term strategy.\"</p> <p>An UKBA spokeswoman says: \"It is clearly desirable that the young people view their time in the UK positively, but the language used by the ICN is not what we would use.\" She adds that it is not part of ICN's remit to convert young Muslims to Christianity.</p> <p><strong>Stability versus destitution</strong></p> <p>The Children's Society has serious concerns about the project, which it feels puts the immigration status of asylum seekers before their rights as children. The charity says there are significant differences in the government planning for unaccompanied asylum seeker children in care and the rest of the children in care population. While the emphasis for the latter group is on stability and support until the age of 21, for the young asylum seekers the outlook is destitution at the age of 18.</p> <p>\"This [project] is something that says, 'We're going to treat these children on the basis of their immigration status rather than as children,'\" says Lisa Nandy, a policy adviser at the Children's Society. \"That's a clear example of failing to abide by the provisions of the Children Act. The state as corporate parent has to put the child's welfare first. To discriminate against one group on the basis of their immigration status is wrong.</p> <p>\"The agenda seems to be forced child returns. Safety doesn't seem to be a key consideration. Charities like ours have been documenting for years the problems child asylum seekers have accessing legal advice [to properly put their asylum claims across]. There's a complete misunderstanding of who these children are. I have never come across a young asylum seeker who doesn't want to go back to their country when it's safe to do so.\"</p> <p>Muir says some of the Afghan boys ICN works with have fled dangerous situations back home in the hope of finding sanctuary here. He says: \"One of the Afghan boys we looked after had been in a Taliban training camp. He could draw diagrams of roadside bombs and everything. He used his wages from the Taliban to escape from them and claim asylum here.\"</p> <p>Abdurahman Jafar, vice-chair of the legal affairs committee of the Muslim Council of Britain, expresses concerns about the scheme. \"It's worrying that this is happening to boys who have claimed asylum,\" he says. \"These boys are very vulnerable, and will they have any choice about going to this project? We feel that it is discriminatory to select people from one particular country for a scheme like this.\"</p> <p><strong>Sensitive treatment</strong></p> <p>The UKBA spokeswoman says: \"We recognise that children demand more sensitive treatment than others in the asylum system, and we meant it when we said in January that we want to deliver more sensitive treatment for these children. We recently said that UKBA should be subject to section 11 of the Children Act 2004, which requires us to protect children from harm and promote welfare. We will cooperate with agencies that safeguard children in the UK, and wherever they are from we will ensure that their welfare is a primary concern.\"</p> <p>However, the Children's Society is protesting to the UKBA about the project. Nandy says: \"Policy is being made in a complete vacuum here. Children should be treated as children, but the immigration status of those selected for this pilot is being put before their welfare.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Troops free two on yacht seized by Somali pirates</h2> <p>French troops stormed a yacht hijacked by Somali pirates, killing one, capturing six and freeing two French hostages. Jean-Yves and Bernadette Delanne were sailing from Australia to France when they were captured on September 2 by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, said he ordered the rescue on Monday - the second such French operation in five months - when it became clear that the pirates planned to take the hostages to Eyl, in Somalia. He said Somali pirates are currently holding 150 people and at least 15 ships, mainly in Eyl. <br><strong>Associated Press in Paris</strong></p> <h2>Eight killed in grenade attack at street party</h2> <p>A grenade attack on Mexican independence celebrations in the city of Morelia that killed at least eight and injured dozens more could signal a new stage in the country's vicious drug wars. Two explosions ripped through the crowd of 30,000, which included many children, minutes after the local governor gave the traditional cry of independence. Officials have not yet apportioned blame but many pointed the finger at the drug cartels, which are battling each other for supremacy while fighting a military-led offensive. Last Friday, 24 bodies were found dumped close to Mexico City. <br><strong>Jo Tuckman in Mexico City </strong></p> <h2>Governor held after death of Morales supporters</h2> <p>The Bolivian president, Evo Morales, said yesterday that soldiers had arrested Leopoldo Fern\u00e1ndez, the governor of Pando province, on \"genocide\" charges for allegedly organising an ambush of pro-Morales demonstrators last week that left at least 15 dead. The unrest, allied with the expulsion of the US ambassador prompted Washington to evacuate Peace Corps volunteers and to advise other Americans to leave. American Airlines suspended flights to Bolivia. Last week, protesters in four provinces, including Pando, seized government buildings to block a vote on Morales's new constitution.<br><strong>Associated Press in La Paz</strong></p>",
  "<h2>New contract pays NHS dentists around \u00a396,000</h2> <p>The pre-tax earnings of all NHS dentists averaged \u00a396,135 in 2006-07 during the first year of a contract that was designed to remove a financial incentive to drill and fill more teeth, the government's health information centre said yesterday. Earnings of higher-paid dentists on contract with the NHS rose by 34.9% to \u00a3172,494, but the centre said changes in data collection made comparison with previous years unreliable. The figures included income from private practice as well as NHS work. The chief dental officer, Barry Cockcroft, said: \"This shows NHS dentistry is on the road to recovery.\"<br><strong>John Carvel</strong></p> <h2>Two in court charged with reporter's murder</h2> <p>Two men appeared in court yesterday charged with the murder of crime journalist Martin O'Hagan in Northern Ireland. Neil Hyde, 28, and Nigel William Leckey, 43, both from Lurgan, Co Armagh, appeared at Lisburn magistrates court accused of killing O'Hagan, a reporter for the Sunday World, in the town in 2001. O'Hagan, 51, was shot dead yards from his home as he walked home from a pub with his wife. Robin Andrew King, 42, was charged with perverting the course of justice and Mark Kennedy, 28, was charged with attempting to impede the apprehension of offenders.<br><strong>Henry McDonald</strong></p> <h2>Pair accused of trying to hide cocaine in wigs</h2> <p>Two young British women were arrested in Jamaica when they allegedly tried to smuggle \u00a3170,000 of cocaine hidden in wigs on to a London-bound plane. The women, aged 17 and 20 and from the Derby area, were detained after the drugs, weighing around 2.3kg, were allegedly discovered stitched into the hair pieces, a spokeswoman for the UK's Revenue and Customs said. The pair, both unemployed, had been on holiday in Jamaica for two weeks before their arrests, she added. The women allegedly told police that they were to be paid \u00a34,000 for smuggling drugs into the UK.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Meehan guilty of child pornography downloads</h2> <p>The former partner of Karen Matthews, whose nine-year-old daughter Shannon was allegedly kidnapped earlier this year, was yesterday convicted of downloading child pornography on to the family's computer. Craig Meehan, 22, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was given a 20-week prison term but released immediately after serving 23 weeks on remand in jail. Meehan was told by district judge Jonathan Bennett that children in the photographs must have suffered \"unimaginable damage\". Meehan has not been linked with the alleged abduction of Shannon.<br><strong>Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <h2>West End braces itself for Priscilla and friends</h2> <p>One of the campest nights out in theatre is coming to London's West End: the stage musical version of the cult movie Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, starring Jason Donovan and a chorus line of eight-foot-tall drag queens. The Oscar-winning 1994 film is a road movie following two drag queens and a transsexual crossing the Outback in a battered bus - Priscilla. It has been a smash hit in Australia as a stage musical since 2004, winning awards for the performers and the outrageous costumes, created by the original film costume designers. The show will open at the Palace Theatre in March.<br><strong>Maev Kennedy</strong></p> <h2>Court to rule on age issue of child asylum seekers</h2> <p>The court of appeal will consider today whether local authorities should have responsibility for determining the age of unaccompanied child asylum seekers. A case is being brought on behalf of an Afghan with learning difficulties who was left homeless in London, and a Libyan teenager also denied support by his local council. Croydon social services assessed the Afghan's age at 18, while a doctor appointed by his solicitors calculated that he was 15. \"Children from countries like Afghanistan may look considerably older than they are,\" said Anna Fairclough of civil rights group Liberty.<br><strong>Afua Hirsch</strong></p> <h2>Police in fatal crash deny dangerous driving charge</h2> <p>A traffic police officer on a training exercise killed another motorist after hitting 104mph on a country road seconds before losing control on a bend, a court heard yesterday. Retired academic Peter Williams, from Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, 67, was killed in the head-on crash near Over Kellett in Lancashire, Liverpool crown court heard. PC Sean Schofield, 38, and a second officer, PC Andrew Massingham, 41, both deny causing death by dangerous driving. Nick Johnson QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the officers were testing a Vascar (vehicle average speed computer and recorder) device.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Faulty equipment blamed for soldiers' deaths</h2> <p>The youngest British soldier to be killed in Afghanistan would not have died if his Land Rover had been fitted with its own bomb-jamming kit, a coroner said yesterday. Private Ben Ford, 18, from Derbyshire, and Private Damian Wright, 23, from Nottinghamshire, were in a convoy and relied on the electronic counter-measures (ECM) protection of Danish vehicles when they struck a radio-controlled Taliban explosive last September, their inquest in Wiltshire heard. But the ECM on the vehicle in front was faulty, bomb disposal experts said. The coroner recorded verdicts of unlawful killing. <br><strong>Rachel Williams</strong></p> <h2>Hirst 'amazed' to raise record \u00a3111m at auction</h2> <p>Damien Hirst's auction at Sotheby's in London made a total of \u00a3111m, a record for a single-artist auction and 10 times that set in 1993 by a Picasso sale. Yesterday morning alone made \u00a324.3m, with all 80 lots sold, added to Monday night's \u00a370m. Sotheby's has not revealed its deal with the artist, but he will have done far better than if selling through his regular galleries, which take commissions of up to 50%. After the sale, he said: \"I'm totally exhausted and amazed my art is selling while banks are falling.I guess it means people would rather put their money into butterflies than banks.\"<br><strong>Maev Kennedy</strong></p> <h2>Children's author will continue Hitchhiker saga</h2> <p>A children's author is to write a further instalment of the best-selling Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy series, 16 years after Douglas Adams penned the fifth and last book. His widow, Jane Belson, has approved Penguin's plan for Eoin Colfer to resurrect hapless hero Arthur Dent in And Another Thing..., to be published in October next year. Colfer, 43, is best known for creating Artemis Fowl, the teenage criminal mastermind who wreaks havoc in this world and the next, but said he was \"terrified\" by the prospect of creating a new Hitchhiker book. Adams died of heart failure in 2001, at 49. <br><strong>Rachel Williams</strong><br></p>",
  "<p>Few people can have done so much to transform other people's lives as Penny Wade, who has died aged 78. As a founder member of the National Childbirth Trust, she promulgated the new thinking that altered women's experience of pregnancy and motherhood. She also worked with the homeless, and, in her home area of Richmond, Surrey, built up a network of services to support vulnerable single people.</p> <p>She was born Penelope Ladds, at Frenchay, near Bristol, daughter of an army officer whose postings took him to India, and later Burma. As war came and the threat of a Japanese invasion mounted, he sent his wife and two children to safety. They had to leave hurriedly, and Penny remembered crouching to avoid the bullets on the floor of the railway carriage as bandits attacked the train from Chittagong to Calcutta. The journey back to Britain, too, was eventful; two ships in their convoy were torpedoed. </p> <p>Penny trained as a nurse at St George's hospital, in London, and worked there for some years, meeting her ebullient Australian husband Robin, a designer, when he was a patient on her ward. Her own pregnancy, while they were living in Denmark, brought her into contact with fresh ideas about natural childbirth. Then, in 1956, by chance she saw an advertisement that Prunella Briance had put in the Times asking anyone interested in forming an association for the promotion of natural childbirth to contact her. </p> <p>Thus Penny became one of the small group of founders of the Natural Childbirth Association (NCA) and played an important role over the following years as it grew to become the National Childbirth Trust (NCT). It is difficult to overstate the difference that this movement has made to women's experience of childbearing and the early stages of motherhood. Before, a medical model had dominated the maternity hospitals, a mother's role was largely passive, and husbands were kept far from the action. </p> <p>Penny's particular concern in those early days was training: teaching mothers, but also health professionals and their teachers, about preparation for natural childbirth.</p> <p>A new interest, flowing from this work, was housing for single mothers, and this brought Penny to the national charity Shelter. In 1977, she took a job setting up and running a drop-in centre in Richmond for lonely or vulnerable people, some with mental health problems, on probation, homeless or otherwise on the margins of society. The Vineyard Project, as it was called, provided a welcoming environment for all-comers. With a friend, Penny founded a local furniture exchange, later to become a wider scheme to recycle surplus furniture to people in need. </p> <p>The growing number of single homeless people - 80 on one count - in Richmond for whom no bed could be found became increasingly troubling, and when, in 1986, two men at the project died while sleeping rough, Penny gathered a team from local groups, churches and professions who planned and secured funding for, first, a night shelter and, later, move-on accommodation and a permanent short-stay hostel. Spear (Single Person's Emergency Accommodation in Richmond) prospered and grew under her chairmanship.</p> <p>Penny was a staunch Labour supporter and pacifist, went on CND marches and later campaigned against the Iraq war. In the 1990s she took an active role in the National Assembly of Women, and was a trustee of the Richmond Parish Lands Charity, became involved with meeting asylum-seekers' needs, and set up a local homelessness forum.</p> <p>She is survived by Robin, a son, two daughters and five grandchildren. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Penelope Wade, social activist, born March 16 1930; died July 22 2008</p>",
  "<p>ITV's director of entertainment and comedy, Paul Jackson, the man behind shows such as Britain's Got Talent and Benidorm, has quit the broadcaster.</p> <p>Confirmation of Jackson's departure comes after months of speculation about his future following the appointment of Peter Fincham as ITV director of programmes in May.</p> <p>Jackson, who joined ITV in February 2006 under its previous director of programmes, Simon Shaps, will leave the broadcaster at the end of the year and is expected to return to production.</p> <p>ITV said no decision had made on his successor - or even if he would be replaced. </p> <p>Fincham paid tribute to Jackson, calling him a \"legend in the entertainment and comedy world\". </p> <p>\"He committed to the role for three years and has commissioned and overseen some of the network's biggest and best programmes including Britain's Got Talent and Benidorm, while taking Dancing on Ice and The X Factor from strength to strength,\" Fincham added. </p> <p>\"I am very grateful for his support and look forward to working with him in his next venture.\"</p> <p>Jackson added: \"I have totally enjoyed my time working for Simon [Shaps] and, more recently, for Peter [Fincham], an old friend for whom I have the greatest personal and professional respect. </p> <p>\"We have had a challenging and exciting ride since the new entertainment and comedy team came together and it has been a blast to work with some of the best professionals you will find in UK television.</p> <p>\"I am leaving a great team with a very full slate of hit shows and a few new ones to play out in the coming months. It's been a fabulous experience, which I wouldn't have missed for anything.\"</p> <p>During his time in the job, Jackson's credits have also included Harry Hill's TV Burp, Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, Dancing on Ice and I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! </p> <p>Jackson joined ITV following a five-year stint in Sydney, where he was managing director of Granada Media Australia.</p> <p>Prior to that, he was controller of entertainment at the BBC.</p> <p>Jackson's is the second departure from the ITV entertainment division in six months, after controller of entertainment Duncan Gray left in March.

  "<p>President George Bush this morning flew to Texas to survey damage from Hurricane Ike, which devastated the gulf region over the weekend, killing at least 40 people and forcing thousands from their homes and leaving millions more without electricity.</p> <p>Bush, who was lambasted for his inattention to New Orleans' recovery after Hurricane Katrina struck three years ago, visited Houston and Galveston Island. The two cities are central to the US oil industry and were battered by Ike, the worst storm to hit Texas in 25 years. </p> <p>Bush spoke with Texas officials and flew over Galveston aboard a helicopter to inspect the damage.</p> <p>\"With proper help from the federal government and the state government there will be a better tomorrow,\" Bush, former governor of Texas, said at an airplane hangar in Houston. \"It is good to be home, I'm just sorry it's under these circumstances.\"</p> <p>Bush said the demand for emergency fuel and water supplies was met, and that electrical workers had streamed into the state to repair downed power lines.</p> <p>He said helping displaced Texans return home was a top priority, but urged them to listen to official warnings before trekking homeward. </p> <p>Bush said the government would reimburse refugees who stayed in hotels and asked Americans to donate to the Red Cross, which helps distribute relief supplies and house refugees.</p> <p>\"I hope the country does not have disaster fatigue,\" he said. Ike is the third storm to smash into the coastal US this month, and large parts of the Mid-west were deluged by the flooding Mississippi river.</p> <p>The 600-mile-wide category two hurricane cut a broad swath through the Texas gulf coast and northward, leaving oil-slicked beaches stripped of vacation homes. In some places, longhorn cattle, a state symbol, roamed desolate streets.<br>Hurricane Ike swept out of the Gulf of Mexico into Texas late Friday. </p> <p>More than 30,000 people remain in shelters, and roughly 2 million without power.</p> <p>Officials have distributed millions of meals and litres of water, as well as generators, tents, tarps and other supplies.</p> <p>Texas emergency workers have rescued more than 3,300 people trapped by flooding in coastal areas. The estimated 40,000 who have fled Galveston have not been allowed to return, and Galveston officials have warned the city may not be fit for human habitation for months.</p> <p>\"Galveston can no longer safely accommodate its population,\" Galveston City Manager Steve LeBlanc told the Associated Press. \"Quite frankly, we are reaching a health crisis for people who remain on the island.\"</p> <p>Most of the 40 people reported killed by Ike were outside Texas. </p> <p>Among the at least 11 killed in the state were three suffocated by carbon monoxide fumes from petrol-powered generators.</p>",
  "<p>At least eight people have been killed in a grenade attack on a crowd celebrating Mexican independence in the city of Morelia.</p> <p>The attack, in which dozens were injured, could signal a new stage in the country's already vicious drug wars. </p> <p>Two explosions ripped through the crowd of around 30,000 people minutes after they listened to the local governor giving the traditional Grito, or cry of independence.</p> <p>The authorities did not immediately identify who they thought was to blame, but many observers assumed the involvement of Mexico's drug cartels. </p> <p>While the country's various leftwing guerrilla groups traditionally shy away from killings, the cartels are deeply immersed in inter-gang wars for the control of trafficking routes, local markets and production. </p> <p>They are also battling against a nationwide military-led offensive, aimed at reining them in, which began in Michoacan, the central state, of which Morelia is the capital, almost two years ago. </p> <p>Launched by the president, Felipe Calderon, who comes from Michoacan, the offensive has so far made the violence worse with close to 3,000 people having been killed in drug-related violence so far this year. </p> <p>Last Friday, 24 bodies were found dumped close to the capital less than two weeks after 12 decapitated bodies were found near the normally tranquil southern city of Merida. </p> <p>Nevertheless last night's attack on a crowd of families, many of them with small children, would be a major scaling up of the traffickers' challenge to the government. They have so far focused on attacking rivals or members of the security forces. </p> <p>A decision to attack the Morelia festivities would be about as charged a message as it would be possible to send in deeply nationalistic Mexico, where similar celebrations take place in the main squares of every city and town. </p> <p>As the grenades were exploding in his home state, Calderon was watching the fireworks over the capital's Zocalo plaza. </p> <p>He used his speech at the start of yesterday's military parade through the capital, another tradition that took place under heightened emergency security measures this year, to condemn the attackers as \"cowards\" and \"traitors.\" </p> <p>Calling for unity across the ideological spectrum he added: \"These criminals are condemned to fail because they will have all of Mexico against them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's military said today its forces had received orders to fire on US troops if they entered Pakistani territory, after a cross-border raid inflamed public opinion.</p> <p>The country's civilian leaders, who have taken a tough line against militants, have insisted Pakistan must resolve the dispute with the US through diplomatic channels. But the military has taken a more robust line.</p> <p>General Athar Abbas, an army spokesman, told the Associated Press that after a cross-border assault in the south Waziristan region earlier this month, the military told its field commanders to take action to prevent any similar raids.</p> <p>\"The orders are clear,\" Abbas said in an interview. \"In case it happens again in this form, that there is a very significant detection, which is very definite, no ambiguity, across the border, on ground or in the air: open fire.\"</p> <p>The remarks mark a sharp deterioration in military relations between the US and Pakistan, which have been close allies in the \"war on terror\" since the September 11 attacks seven years ago. </p> <p>The Bush administration has shown increasing impatience over what it considers Pakistan's incapacity or unwillingness to crack down on Taliban and al-Qaida fighters operating on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.</p> <p>Pakistan insists it is doing what it can. It has about 100,000 troops in the restive north-west and suicide bombers are inflicting an increasingly deadly toll on the Pakistani army.</p> <p>American officials have confirmed that their forces carried out a raid near the town of Angoor Ada but have given few details. Abbas said Pakistan's military had asked for an explanation but received only a \"half-page\" of \"very vague\" information that did not identify the intended target. Pakistani officials have said the raid killed about 15 people, and Abbas said they all appeared to be civilians.</p> <p>He would not say whether General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who replaced Pervez Musharraf as head of the army last year, personally made the decision on orders to fire on US troops or if it had been discussed with US officials.</p> <p>The army spokesman played down reports that Pakistani forces yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/16/pakistan.usa\">shot at US helicopters</a> after they penetrated national air space. Abbas insisted no foreign troops had crossed the border and that \"trigger-happy tribesmen\" had fired the shots. </p> <p>Pakistani troops based nearby fired flares to see what was going on, he said. The US military in Afghanistan said none of its troops were involved in such an incident yesterday. </p> <p>As the US steps up its military activity in the sensitive tribal area, Pakistani officials have warned that an increase in cross-border raids will achieve little and fuel the insurgency in Pakistan. Some complain that the country is being made a scapegoat for the failure to stabilise Afghanistan.</p> <p>In a rare public statement last week, Kayani said Pakistan's sovereignty would be defended \"at all cost\". Abbas said Pakistani officials had to consider public opinion, which was increasingly anti-American and had some sympathy for rebels claiming to fight in the name of Islam.</p> <p>\"Please look at the public reaction to this kind of adventure or incursion,\" Abbas said. \"The army is also an extension of the public and you can only satisfy the public when you match your words with your actions.\"</p> <p>Last week, Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said a new strategy for Afghanistan was needed that incorporated the tribal territory. George Bush is believed to have signed a secret order allowing US forces to operate in the tribal area, even though the UN mandate for international forces in Afghanistan does not extend into Pakistan.</p>",
  "<p>When someone comes up with such an odd number as 27 for a list, then you know they are really getting a bit desperate for ideas (unless it is a list of all the letters of the alphabet plus the new one that they have just invented). Such is the extent of immigration minister <a href=\"http://www.liambyrne.co.uk/\">Liam Byrne</a>'s list of the ways that we could possibly celebrate Gordon Brown's proposed new Britishness day, published in the Demos report <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/amoreuk\">A More United Kingdom</a>. Surely he could have made it to 30 if he had tried really hard.</p> <p>I should know, as I managed to come up with more than <a href=\"http://britishinnit.com/citizenship.html\">300 ideas</a> to sum up Britishness when writing my book on the topic, We're British, Innit. I did send Gordon Brown a copy, but maybe it didn't make it in time for him to pass it on to Byrne.</p> <p>As it is, Byrne's list reads very much like it was written on the bus, hoping to cover all points and with a fear of leaving anything at all relevant out. This was hardly conviction thinking, reading more like a muddled brainstorming session involving a quick call to his best mate, who was a bit busy, and then calling his mother for a couple of extra ideas to stick on the end just before deadline. Come on, even the <a href=\"http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/bild-english/world-news/2008/09/15/british-prime-minister-gordon-brown/urges-brits-to-celebrate-cultural-heritage-by-drinking.html\">Germans</a> are laughing.</p> <p>Forgetting the list for a moment, let us consider the main plank of the idea of a day celebrating Britishness. This sounds like a good wheeze for an ailing prime minister, especially a Scottish one who doesn't want to be sent north of the border for his bank holiday, but if Gordon Brown wants us to celebrate a Britishness day in the way that the Irish, and anyone who has ever sniffed a pint of Guinness, celebrate St Patrick's Day then he should probably start with the basics: give us all a day off.</p> <p>As it is, the plan is to steal the second bank holiday in May and replace it with this day of all things British. As things stand we already have the right to get drunk, picnic, shelter from the rain or simply watch television on this day, so what difference will painting it red-white-and-blue make?</p> <p>Well, perhaps the answers lie in Byrne's list. Let's see. Well, drinking is down there, so at least he has our favourite pastime nailed. What else? \"In the form of a remembrance day celebrating the bravery of veterans\". Well, that would be <a href=\"http://www.myremembranceday.org.uk/\">Remembrance Day</a>, which is in November. \"By celebrating different cultural dress\" sounds exactly the kind of thing that Chief Superintendent Colin Terry was sacked for this week after donning his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/11/police\">Bin Laden</a> apparel in Cornwall, while \"by incorporating countries that used to be part of the empire\" sounds slightly more imperial than perhaps Byrne intended.</p> <p>There is also \"by appreciating the country; weather; enjoyment\", which means we can celebrate joy of rain and, erm, joy itself. Hurray. Things don't get too much better with \"by holding a ceremony to remember the good things over the past year\", either. Lord only knows what we would do in a non-Olympic year. Though there is the suggestion of another Queen's speech and maybe some British history on television, which should see the youth of today at least forced outdoors for some exercise, leading to possible future Olympic glory.</p> <p>I am sure we can all come up with at least 27 better ways to celebrate Britishness than those Byrne came up with, so let's get started. I promise I will pass them on to him. Who knows, you may even win a place on the New Year's Honours list.</p>",
  "<p>For millions of people in the UK, anti-terror legislation is rather distant, its finer points discussed only by politicians, specialist lawyers and the like. We hear about attempts to introduce tough laws; we hear about new arrests, and we get on with our lives. But for my friend Hicham and me, the force of the new anti-terror legislation suddenly became a harsh reality. Our arrests have implications for the rights of individuals in Britain to read legally available open-source documents free from the fear of arrest. </p> <p>May 14 2008. A postgraduate international relations student at the University of Nottingham and a principle administrator in the modern languages department (also a former postgraduate student at the university), Rizwaan Sabir and Hicham Yezza, were arrested under section 41 of the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_5\">Terrorism Act 2000</a>. I type this sentence, and despite everything, I still find it difficult to comprehend the arrests. We were detained for six days, unable to see our family or friends on suspicion of being involved in the \"commission, preparation, or instigation\" of an act of terrorism. Our homes were raided and my terrified family evicted from their home. </p> <p>The operation, codenamed Minerva, was led by the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit and involved 26 police officers, forensic experts, three police raids, and thousands of pounds of hard-earned taxpayers' money. </p> <p>After failing to find justification to detain me any longer, on day six of our ordeal, I was released without a charge, without an apology; but with a police warning against accessing an openly available, widely cited al-Qaida document considered relevant to my postgraduate research by me and my academic supervisors. I was only put under threat of future arrest, but Hicham's terrifying detention was prolonged by the authorities, under immigration charges \u2013 his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/18/terrorism.civilliberties\">ordeal continues</a> to this very day. </p> <p>What was our offence?</p> <p>Our offence was that we had in our possession an edited version of a document referred to as the \"al-Qaida training manual\". A document freely available on the US Department of Justice website and that of the Federation of American Scientists. A document widely available elsewhere on official and unofficial internet sites, in either edited or full versions. A document purchasable in paperback from Amazon. A document I had downloaded months ago for my masters dissertation and upcoming PhD. A document a lecturer knew I was consulting. A document I had sent months ago to Hicham who was helping me draft my PhD proposal. A document many other academics and students studying terrorism will have had in their possession. A document extensively cited in books on terrorism. A bog-standard source. Nothing extraordinary or remarkable about its possession \u2013 one would think. </p> <p>Once placed under arrest in the car park of the University's Trent building, I naively thought I would be released in a few hours, that it was all a terrible misunderstanding or a sick joke. </p> <p>We were taken to Bridewell police station (a small specialised prison complex consisting of approximately 90 cells) and placed in a cell. I was informed that a warrant would soon be issued and my house would be raided. I had still not been told the reason for my arrest. </p> <p>For the suspected \"terrorists\" (Hicham and me), they had sealed off the entire second floor of the prison. We were kept in solitary confinement. Our only human contact \u2013 apart from the detention officers and my lawyer \u2013 was with a judge that smiled down on us whilst stamping an authorisation order for a further five days detention. </p> <p>For the first 12 hours I was incommunicado. For the first 2 days I was on a 24-hour watch. Two officers sat outside my open cell door, watching my every move and making notes in a custody log. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I was too scared to pray, lest that be used against me. My property was seized, forensically examined, and my family evicted. My car was compounded and my friends and lecturers repeatedly questioned. I was photographed, fingerprinted, foot-printed and DNA-swabbed. It was the first time in my life I had felt so criminalised and degraded.</p> <p>I was interviewed once a day, except for the last day, when I sat through two mind-numbing interviews. I was asked my opinion of the training manual, whether I had used it, or was planning on using it, or whether I had disseminated it. I was asked if I had ever travelled to Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan or Turkey (obviously the lack of stamps in my passport weren't enough to convince them), whether I had ever been camping, or was planning a camping trip. I was questioned about September 11 and asked to explain what I thought of al-Qaida. The interviews got more absurd with time. I was questioned about journal articles in my bedroom from Foreign Affairs and World Politics, photographs I had taken of friends with Edinburgh Castle in the background, and questioned about cheesy pop CDs from the early 1990s \u2013 embarrassingly \u2013 discovered in my bedroom. <br> Unfettered questioning and microscopic searches for six days did not produce any evidence, and I was released without charge. The police had finally realised I was a postgraduate student studying terrorism; not a member of an al-Qaida sleeper-cell.</p> <p>Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, has made it clear, in his speeches and through his department's guidance to universities, that academic freedom is important and that it is vital that academics and students should be able to study terrorism. Nevertheless, in apparent contravention of the government guidance, the police threatened me with further detention if I used the document for my research. </p> <p>I would like to say my freedom to research had the full backing of my University authorities, but unfortunately they appear unwilling to uphold the right of their students to read and study legal, openly available documents free from the fear of arrest.<br> My feeling upon release was sheer relief and happiness; the joy of freedom and the pleasure of seeing my loved ones was something I had never encountered before. But beneath it all lay terrifying thoughts and questions; what would have happened if I had been charged? How would I have coped in a maximum-security prison? The answers to these questions still haunt me today.</p> <p>The authorities have a tough job fighting terrorism. But locking away innocent people without prior investigation (for what may soon be <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7449268.stm\">42 days</a>) to later release them without charge is certainly not the way. It is not the way to make Britain safer. It is not the way to bring a multicultural and multiracial society together. It is not the way to unit British citizens against terrorism, but it is a way of setting a very worrying precedent that might achieve just the opposite. <br> Detaining people who have actually committed a crime of which there is evidence is understandable, but detaining those against whom there is no evidence is not.</p>",
  "<p>September 10, 2008 will go down in history as one of the more bizarre days of my life. I was in New York on a brief visit for work, dividing my time between <a href=\"http://www.bridgeandtunnelclub.com/bigmap/queens/astoria/ditmars/index.htm\">Queens</a> and Manhattan. I want to say that the day started out like every other but I've never lodged at such a posh hotel in Midtown before (and had an overpriced $46 breakfast that consisted of just a couple of pastries, a jug of coffee and an orange juice).</p> <p>First up was an audience with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970416/\">Keanu Reeves</a>. We got on to the subject of my first movie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/dec/11/ladiary43drumrollpleasemymoviesonline\">Maconie's List</a>. I told him the premise line and he seemed to like it. We discussed the various endings, the battle I had to keep the integrity of the movie and he asked to see a copy. As a matter of course, I carry it with me at all times. I've learned, especially living in LA, that you can bump into anybody at anytime so always leave the house prepared. I fished the DVD out of my bag and handed it over to Keanu Reeves. Neo. Bill. Or was it Ted?</p> <p>I'm now waiting for the phone to ring with an offer of a record-breaking development deal. Yup, still waiting.</p> <p>I wandered back to my hotel across a sunny and squirrel-infested Central Park, sauntered into the lobby and made a beeline for the lift. Shuffling in, I looked up at the two other people standing there and almost fell over in shock. It was the Divine Miss M, Bette Midler and her lovely PR man Ken Sunshine.</p> <p>As you may recall, Bette was the inspiration for <a href=\"http://www.beachedthemovie.com/\">Beached</a>, the film I made earlier this year with Abi Roberts, and the one that counts as my second official outing as director. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/mar/07/ladiarybeingbettemidlerinvegasbaby\">We had the good fortune to meet Bette</a> after her show in Vegas back in February, and told her about the film then. I reminded her who I was, ran the premise line past her (my day was clearly turning into one long premise line) and laughing, she asked to see it. I promised faithfully that we'd send her the DVD and soundtrack as soon as possible. </p> <p>A couple of hours later, I decided to stretch my legs in Central Park and crossing the lobby bumped into soul singing duo, Ashford and Simpson. They had a hit in the 80s with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtELkPlKP-E\">Solid</a> but they also wrote one of my favourite songs, California Soul. A friend of mine put the Marlena Shaw version on a mix tape (well, CD actually) just before I left for these shores, so I told them how much I loved it. It's been on my shuffle for 18 months now, and they seemed genuinely pleased by the compliment.</p> <p>Meandering around the park, I accidentally ended up in line to see <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/event/670786\">The Kooks</a>in concert (the support group was called The Marques, pronounced Marks). I managed to extricate myself having seen them for free at the side of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/may/26/foreditorsladiary\">Jimmy Kimmel</a> stage a couple of months ago.</p> <p>Thinking that nothing else odd could possibly happen, I walked over to the <a href=\"http://www.wollmanskatingrink.com/main_wollman.htm\">ice rink</a> now transformed into a fairground for summer, past the girl who I sat next to on the plane from LA. We gave each other a double take and screamed out in unison. \"It's you!\" She's called <a href=\"http://www.ardenkaywin.com/\">Arden Kaywin</a> and is a singer-songwriter, who seems to be the verge of big things. She took my number because, as she said, \"There's clearly a reason why we've run into each other again.\"<br> So I'm going to her launch party for her album, The Elephant in the Room, next month and she's promised to introduce me to her brother who is a film producer. </p> <p>Later, I had cocktails at Chiblis in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery\">Bowery</a> and got $60 worth of drinks for free because they took so long to bring our food. </p> <p>But I was full of it anyway. Still am.</p>",
  "<p>Lost in Showbiz would like to throw our weight behind Noel Edmonds's anti-TV licence campaign. </p> <p>We do this not because we believe \u00a3139.50 is too much for a licence, nor because, as Noel does, we dislike the corporation's adverts warning that it's an offence not to have one. No. We do it because we feel he needs someone to be nice to him just at the moment ... and this is the part of his recent outpouring that we feel more able (it's a relative thing) to support. </p> <p>The other bit, you see, is that Noel, who believes in Cosmic Ordering and therefore has decided that his dead parents' souls are floating around him in orbs, has also decided that there has to be an absolute stop to immigration into Britain. </p> <p>\"The politicians - and I am talking about Gordon Brown - have had their day,\" he says. Which, I'd imagine, is a tiny little flicker of hope on an otherwise fairly gloomy horizon for the PM.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> New York. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Ben (electronics), Lo (vocals), Prince Terrence (drums), Kate (visuals). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> If you like Crystal Castles but find their 8-bit punk-disco hard to swallow, then try Hearts Revolution, yet another duo \u2013 two really is the new black - who are offering a sort of accessible (these things being relative) version of that extreme electro-terrorist digital hardcore sound. In a parallel universe, their songs, a series of yelps over DIY shards of rhythm with chanted choruses and slim, size-zero melodies, would all be smash hits. Hearts Revolution, who have been touring as support to the New Band of the Day-sanctioned Midnight Juggernauts, call themselves thrash-metal electronicists and boy/grrrl revolutionaries, with echoes in the latter phrase of the likes of Huggy Bear from the early-90s riot grrrl era. In fact, they're like Huggy Bear plugged into the National Grid. They've even remixed the Bear's best-known song, Her Jazz, with its immortal kiss-off to the straight world, \"This is happening without your permission\". They've got songs that teeter on that fine line between brutal and beautiful, songs about laser beams and wolves and libertines, with titles like Ultraviolence and Switchblade, which sound like they've been lifted from one of Bobby Gillespie's doodle-pads. They've even got a genuinely pretty ballad called Digital Suicide with shades of Suicide's Dream Baby Dream that references something called \"sonic dreams\" and contains a deeply old-fashioned demand to \"stop the world, I want to get off\".<br> And yet they're so fashionable and of-the-moment that Hearts Revolution are currently making people in Hoxton weep tears of joy. They've got all the right global connections (New York, Tokyo, LA, Paris), if they were any better looking it would be illegal, oh, and they \"redrawing the lines between art and commerce\". Just like that. Roughly translated, this means they're handling the packaging and marketing, the visual aspect of what they do, all by themselves, under the rubric, Choose Your Own Adventure. Live, artist and fashion designer Kate Moross adds fluoro images and projections, but they don't play regular gigs, no sir, that would be so 20th century. No, instead they've got their own branded ice-cream truck, a pink machine called Hearts Challenger that is known to pull up at parties, art openings and music events, and from the back of which they spontaneously jam (a rockist term meaning \"plug in and play\"). They also sell sweets and Japanese toys from the van as a way of enhancing the idea of Hearts Revolution as a self-contained dream world. But they're not nihilists or angry angst-merchants. \"We do what we want, support who we love,\" they declare, quaintly. \"How? We are powered by love.\" Cute. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"They are dedicated to progressing the state of music and pushing change in all the right places.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> They're a Crystal Castles you don't have to pretend to like.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Sell you some sherbet fountains.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Sell you the idea of rock'n'roll as a capitalist scheme to control the masses.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Their debut single Ultraviolence is released on December 1 by Kitsune. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Crystal Castles, Atari Teenage Riot, the Boredoms, Shampoo. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/heartsrevolution\">www.myspace.com/heartsrevolution</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Peter Conway. </p>",
  "<p>The oil price took another dive today following the crisis on Wall Street, and relief that the latest hurricane to threaten the US had only caused minor damage to infrastructure.</p> <p>Having crashed through $100 a barrel yesterday, the cost of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">US crude oil</a> fell by another $4 this morning to as low as $91.54 today. It is now a third lower than its all-time peak of $145.29 a barrel, set in July this year.</p> <p>London Brent crude also slipped sharply, losing another $4.44 to $89.80 a barrel this morning.</p> <p>The recent weakening in the oil price offers hope to cash-strapped drivers and the airline industry. It could also help to stop the steady rise in inflation, which today hit 4.7%.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, chancellor of the exchequer, said today that the recent fall in the oil price should be seen as a positive development.

  "<p>The Venice Biennale of Architecture may not be as prestigious as the older and larger <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/history/\">Biennale of Contemporary Art</a>, but it still represents a unique opportunity to explore not only the national pavillions of the <a href=\"http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_giardini\">Giardini</a>, the Biennale Gardens, but also a host of spaces - the Arsenale, palaces, churches, private mansions - that are normally closed off to the public. The title of the 11th Biennale is Out There: Architecture Beyond Building, which gives a clear indication that these days the exhibits are just as interesting for the general public as for professional architects and designers. There is an incredible choice of exhibits from 56 countries, plus 25 collateral events. Seeing everything is pretty much impossible, so here are 10 not to miss.</p> <h2>1. Biennale Gardens, British Pavillion </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657182\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/britain2.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: British Pavillion\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any visit to the Biennale begins at the Giardini, the sprawling gardens where over 30 countries have their national pavilions. It is not chauvinistic for once to say that the British pavillion is one of the grandest, strategically looking down over the adjoining French and German pavillions. And this year's exhibition, Home/Away, has been acclaimed as one of the best in the Biennale. Five architects - Sergison Bates, Tony Fretton, de Rijke Marsh Morgan, Witherford Watson Mann and Maccreanor Lavington - have been selected to illustrate the particularly British obsession of owning your own house, and examine whether this can function in the rest of Europe. And the questions asked could not be more relevant given the current credit crunch and collapse of the housing market.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/biennale/intro.html\">britishcouncil.org/biennale/intro</a></p> <h2>2. Ca' Del Duca, Luxembourg</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657730\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/luxembourg.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: Ca' Del Duca, Luxembourg\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As you follow signs for Luxembourg's pavillion, you come to what looks like a dead end - a small courtyard with a single tall tree coming out on to the Grand Canal. But a small door at the end leads to the discrete <a href=\"http://www.boglewood.com/cornaro/xcadelduca.html\">Ca' Del Duca</a> palace, which was built in the 15th century. Luxembourg's exhibition could not be more minimalist - a series of white boards that snake from one room into another. But the idea is intriguing for those who take the time to read about it - four crucial architectural questions answered by 12 different Europeans.</p> <h2>3. Museo Diocenesa Urbis</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657731\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/cloister.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: Museo Diocenesa Urbis\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This collateral exhibition showcases the architectually influenced artworks of the Venetian artist, <a href=\"http://www.gaspare-foundation.com/exhibitions.html\">Gaspare Manos</a>. There are 150 works on show, and his paintings are bright, vivid impressions of cities around the world. But this is also a brilliant opportunity to discover one of Venice's most wonderful cloisters, the <a href=\"http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/italy/venice/review-186474.html\">Chiostro di Sant Apollonia</a>. Built in the 12th century, this is Venice's only surviving Romanesque cloister, and the rest of the building where the exhibition is on view is a former Benedictine Monastery.</p> <h2>4. Corderie &amp; Artigliere</h2> <p>The ancient buildings of Venice's once mighty <a href=\"http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/italy/venice/review-146821.html\">Arsenale</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/venues/corderie/\">Corderie and Artigliere</a>, form a vast alternative exhibition hall for the countries that don't have their own national pavillion in the Biennale Gardens. The space itself is easily as impressive as many of the installations, and it sometimes seems that each exhibit just tries to shock the visitor more than its neighbour. The local press has been delightfully shocked by the Swiss architect, <a href=\"http://www.philipperahm.com/\">Philippe Rahm</a> whose Meterological installation of hot and cold panels features eight live performers, two of whom are nude. Other exhibits not to miss are those of British designer <a href=\"http://www.artandculture.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ACLive.woa/wa/artist?id=797\">Nigel Coates</a>, and Living Inhere, a look at the problems of urban architecture in Mexico City.</p> <h2>5. Palazzo Giustinian Lolin, Ireland </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657183\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/ireland2.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: Palazzo Giustinian Lolin, Ireland\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You have to navigate your way through a maze of dark, narrow Venetian backstreets to actually find Ireland's exhibition, but it is well worth the effort as the pavillion is housed in a magnificent 17th-century palazzo that looks out on to the Grand Canal. Push through the door and you enter a closed courtyard with a grand well, and The Lives of Spaces is housed in a series of rooms decorated with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murano\">Murano</a> chandeliers and period paintings on the first floor. It is quite a contrast to the videos, TV screens and minimalist white cubes illustrating nine \"lives\" of different spaces, through the design, construction, original use and later reuse.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thelivesofspaces.com\">thelivesofspaces.com</a></p> <h2>6. Chiesa di San Stae, Russia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657184\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/sanStaeChurch.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: Chiesa di San Stae, Russia\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You can't miss the sumptuous white baroque facade of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Stae\">San Stae</a> church, and there is a vaporetto water bus stop right outside, so it is easy to get to. Usually tourists wander in to gaze at the marvellous religious paintings, including one by <a href=\"http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo\">Tiepolo</a>, but for the duration of the Biennale, the interior is dramatically transformed by Bornhouse, an exhibition of 26 Russian and international architects considering the rather weighty theme of \"birth\", both of buildings and humans. The result is rather stunning, as a glowing creche has been built in the middle of the church, filled with architectural objects like clay, papier-mache, glass and metal</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bornhouse.com\">bornhouse.com</a></p> <h2>7. Campo Della Tana, Hong Kong, Fabrica Cultura </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657185\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/hongkong2.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: Campo Della Tana, Hong Kong\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Situated just opposite the entrance to the Arsenale, this typical Venetian \"campo\", is a small, enclosed square with an adjoining warehouse. It is something of a poor cousin to many of the grand national pavillions, but at least Hong Kong has retained its sovereignty and separateness from mainland China, which doesn't even have its own pavillion and exhibits in the Giardini as part of the Italian pavillion. Hong Kong has created a colourful, vibrant \"Cultural Factory\", including not just architects but designers, photographers, performers and writers. Six different projects are presented, and check out the fun T-shirts of Prince Charles and Bill Clinton in the 'Accidental Urbanism\" section.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hkia.net\">hkia.net</a></p> <h2>8.

It is hosting what is termed a \"collateral event\" organised by the <a href=\"http://www.mudima.net\">Fondazione Mudima</a> from Milan. This is almost more Biennale of Art than Architecture, where painting, sculpture, photography, video and performance are used to interpret a very conceptual theme, and perhaps not surprisingly, one of the stars of the show is Yoko Ono.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mudima.net/\">mudima.net</a></p> <h2>9. Palazzo Franchetti, The Universe of Jorn Utzon </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657187\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/palazzofranchetti.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: Palazzo Franchetti\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Situated just by the Accademia bridge, the <a href=\"http://www.istitutoveneto.it/roomsfacilities/\">Palazzo Franchetti</a> is quite simply one of the most beautiful palaces that line the Grand Canal. Built in the 15th century, it incorporates a stunning mix of Gothic and Byzantine influences, and today is the headquarters of the Venetian Institute of Science, Letters and Art. During the Biennale, visitors can admire both its splendid interiors and a major exhibition dedicated to the life and works of Danish architect, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B8rn_Utzon\">Jorn Utzon</a>, creator of the Sydney Opera House.</p> <h2>10. Arsenale Spazio Thesis, An Italian Garden in Tianjin </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657188\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/arsenalespaziothesis2.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: Arsenale Spazio Thesis\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No one should miss the chance to wander round Venice's historic Arsenale - the shipyard where warships of the Venetian were madde and launched centuries ago - which still has a military \"no entrance\" status for the rest of the year. Don't stop at the Artiglerie and Corderie either, carry on past the huge rusting cranes and boats awaiting repair until you reach the point where a tiny boat ferries visitors across to a new exhibition area, the Spazio Thesis. Inside these industrial workshops is possibly the most magical exhibit of the Biennale, illustrating a classic Italian garden inspired by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Venus_(Botticelli)\">Botticelli's The Birth of Venus</a> that is actually under construction in the Chinese town of Tianjin.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.minambiente.it/\">miniambiente.it</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 11th Biennale of Architecture runs until November 23. Open daily 10am-6pm. Tickets for Giardini and Arsenale valid for two days: \u20ac15. Entry to exhibitions in the city of Venice is free, though most are closed on Mondays. <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org\">labiennale.org</a></p>",
  "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337654987\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/butter460.jpg\" alt=\"Butter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fat of the land. Photograph: David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's rare in life that one finds oneself looking to Hermann Goering for relationship advice, but today, I'm afraid, is just such an occasion. It was the commander of the Luftwaffe who memorably pointed out the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_versus_butter_theory\">superiority of guns over butter</a> in winning wars and, as our own butter conflict has now gone critical, I can't help feeling it's time to tool up.</p> <p>I, like most rational people, am fond of butter, particularly when spread on a fresh croissant or a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/sep/10/foodanddrink2\">slice of 'no-knead'</a> just cooled from the oven. Crucial to this small indulgence is butter that can actually be spread. Nothing, and I mean nothing, could be more calculated to engender spitting rage and throbbing hatred than ice-cold, rock solid butter. I'm convinced that somewhere in the Baker's childhood lurks an awful trauma involving butter because there remains an irrational terror of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancidity\">rancidity</a> and, as a result, butter is only safe when cryogenically stored.<br><br>I tried to solve the problem by acquiring at great cost, from America, a '<a href=\"http://www.butterbell.com/\">butter bell</a>' - a dish which can be inverted into water allowing it to remain at room temperature while safely excluding air. Late one night I packed it with <a href=\"http://www.isigny-ste-mere.com\">beurre d'Isigny</a> - the expensive, indulgent sort with the huge crystals of guerande salt - and, for one blissful morning was able to spread butter on my toast with indecent license.</p> <p>A day later I found the butter bell emptied, boil-washed and standing pointedly in the middle of the prep bench. </p> <p>'It was rancid' said the Baker.</p> <p>I'm prepared to accept that some people might be super-sensitive to the 'decomposition of fats, oils and other lipids by hydrolysis or oxidation'- though on balance I find it more likely that some people just have no bloody idea what they're talking about - but I'm not prepared to accept that filthy 'spreadable' muck the Baker has supplied as gesture of conciliation, which seems to comprise equal quantities of lard, butterfat, cheap oil and air.</p> <p>Just in case you think I'm being unreasonable here, let me point out one thing.</p> <p>As I sit, typing this I'm looking across the kitchen table to the counter where 4.75kg of unsalted butter is stacked in 250g bricks <em>and has been since last night</em>. The Baker requires huge quantities of butter, perfectly chambreed, for creaming into cake mixes. </p> <p>I'm not allowed to touch this butter - every gram is spoken for and nicking a bit to go on my toast would result in hissing ostracisation or an extended verbal flaying. Does the Baker's butter go rancid when left on the counter overnight? Certainly not \u2026 though I still can't get any kind of explanation of this unique phenomenon.</p> <p>So, the Baker's sunk to the elbows in the soft stuff while my butter's back in the fridge, where it belongs, perfectly preserved until I attack it at breakfast with a cold-chisel and a thermic lance. </p> <p>Though it pains my liberal soul to admit it, the Reichsmarschall got it bang on the button. I'm going to need guns \u2026 lots of guns.</p>",
  "<p>It's been a torrid time for Italy's major film festivals over the past few weeks. First Venice was criticised for failing to secure the star names and quality films of previous years. Now its upstart rival Rome has been forced to deny that it turned down the opportunity to host the European premiere of Oliver Stone's George Bush biopic, W, for political reasons.</p> <p>Reports in Saturday's edition of the newspaper La Repubblica had suggested that pressure from Italy's political right had caused organisers to spurn Stone's film, which, despite protests of impartiality from the film-maker, looks set to be a fierce indictment of the 43rd president of the United States' personality and politics.</p> <p>Yesterday, the festival's artistic director, Piera Detassis, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i6f1a24d20528a54743d2b04e35eafbb3\">told</a> the Hollywood Reporter that the event had simply lost out to the London film festival for the chance to screen the film.</p> <p>\"Yes, we wanted the film,\" he said. \"Of course we wanted it; what festival would not want the latest Oliver Stone film?\"</p> <p>He denied that Rome's new mayor, Gianni Alemanno, a former neo-fascist youth leader who is backed by Silvio Berlusconi, had imposed his influence on the decision. However, Alemanno's arrival has already seen the replacement of festival president Goffredo Bettini with critic and former Venice director Gian Luigi Rondi.</p> <p>The new mayor, Rome's first rightwing civic leader since the second world war, campaigned partly on a platform of \"less cinema and more security\", a reference to his anti-immigration platform and opposition to spending money on film festivals. </p> <p>His arrival comes at a difficult time for Rome, which was inaugurated only two years ago. The festival immediately set itself up as a rival to the venerable Venice film festival, offering a whopping 200,000 euro top prize and attracting journalists and distributors from all over Europe. But it already looks to be in trouble.</p> <p>W will screen at the London film festival on Thursday, October 23.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe because we grew up with him, maybe because - like the Beatles or Stonehenge - he's always been there, it's easy to forget exactly how strange Noel Edmonds is. It's not like he's coy about his eccentricity. He sees no contradiction, for example, in being the face of BBC light entertainment and leading <a href=\"http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4753618.ece\">a boycott of the licence fee</a>. Then <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1055732/My-dead-parents-melon-sized-orbs-New-Age-Noel-Edmonds-bizarre-air-rant.html\">in an interview at the weekend</a> he spoke about being followed by two \"melon-sized orbs\" which he believed were his dead parents. \"Conventional photography can't pick them up but digital cameras can,\" he said. \"I've got loads of photographs of me at home with two orbs that visit me.\" Not to mention <a href=\"http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news/article25476.ece\">his views on immigration</a> \u2026</p> <p>The focal point for his leftfield ideas is <a href=\"http://sky1.sky.com/noels-hq\">his current project Noel's HQ</a> which aims to \"fix broken Britain\". Edmonds was happy to expand upon this, addressing the viewer on the show: \"You clearly feel frustrated and at times angry at the tidal wave of new rules, regulations and laws that have been introduced in the name of health and safety, security or the environment.\"</p> <p>Oh dear. You would have hoped that Edmonds would appreciate health and safety regulations. On the Late Late Breakfast Show in 1983, a series of stunt drivers took turns jumping a row of cars leading to Guy Skippon's car screeching onto the trackside narrowly avoiding spectators and Rich Smith's hospitalisation. A clearly shaken John Peel, providing the commentary, beheld a scene as harrowing as any late-night Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten session. Then in 1986 <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=TdakKgmYH7I\">Michael Lush was killed</a> rehearsing a bungee jump he was to perform on the show. The show was scrapped. </p> <p>Yet Noel still has that annoying habit of fronting winning formats. From <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=vnHGeAQbRiA\">Swap Shop</a> to <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=\" 16rfzmm5ogm\" \">Noel's House Party</a> then <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=\" k7-l6bpagrc\" \">Deal or No Deal</a>, he just instinctively grasps what people want. Although ideologically he seems to be a disturbing blend of equal parts David Icke, Jeremy Clarkson and Robert Kilroy, so long as he keeps his TV Midas touch he's going to remain a curious feature on our broadcasting landscape.</p>"
