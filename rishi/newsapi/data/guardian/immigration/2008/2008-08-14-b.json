  "<p>1. Madonna's \"Confessions ...\" tour was the highest-grossing tour by a female artist. In your face, Lisa Scott-Lee.</p> <p>2. Madonna was only inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year because the Hall of Fame requires a minimum career length of 25 years. Therefore, we still have a while to wait until the Hall of Fame is able to recognise the genius of Gary Lightbody, Roy from Scouting for Girls or Shaggy. Perhaps it is time they looked at making a few exceptions for these titans of popular song.</p> <p>3. Madonna likes clothes. Madonna also likes money. Happily, she has found a way to combine these two passions, having appeared in advertisements for Gap - with Missy Elliott - and H&amp;M, for whom she designed (\"designed\") a range of clothes.</p> <p>4. During the course of their training all local TV news reporters and tabloid journalists are coached in referring to Madonna as \"The Material Girl\" at least twice every 18 months. This is in reference to Madonna's hit single Material Girl.</p> <p>5. According to her brother Christopher, the only thing Madonna can cook is Rice Krispie cakes. This means that dishes she is incapable of serving up include La Isla Bolognese, Dear Jelly, Hanky Lamb Shanky, Don't Cry for Me Polenta, and Crazy for Yule Log.</p> <p>6. People call her Madge, although not to her face.</p> <p>7. Felix Howard, the fresh-faced 13-year-old in the Open Your Heart video, is now a music business bigwig and has written songs for artists including Amy Winehouse, Kylie Minogue and Sugababes.</p> <p>8. Like A Virgin was originally written for a MAN. Disgusting.</p> <p>9. Artists to have sung songs about Madonna include Robbie Williams (the Pet Shop Boys collaboration She's Madonna was the best song on Rudebox, whatever that counts for), Sparks (\"Madonna\" tells the story of a late night cab right with The Madgster) and the Androids (Do It With Madonna is about rumpo). Madonna is also referenced in Sophie Ellis-Bextor's New York City Lights: \"Madonna says it's true, the town gets hold of you\". Quite a good line.</p> <p>10. It's a myth that Madonna went to Times Square with only $35 and some ballet shoes, according \u2013 once again! - to her brother. Apparently, she went there with money and loads of contacts, although if you're going to have a go at a master manipulator like Madonna for rewriting her own past then you might as well go around shouting at cows for mooing and shooting milk out of their tits.</p> <p>11. The best Madonna headline ever to have appeared in the popular press was Fallen Madonna With The Big Boobies, although for that to make any sort of sense you need to know that it was just after she fell off a horse, and even then you'd still be confused if you weren't familiar with British 80s sitcom Allo Allo. You had to be there, etc.</p> <p>12. Madonna has performed at Live 8, Live Aid and Live Earth, although somehow the world is STILL plagued by hunger and poverty and the environment STILL looks like it is all going tits up. The looming inevitability of the latter catastrophe is all the more surprising given that Madonna actually wrote a new song, Hey You, for Live Earth. Clearly, \"the environment\" is no fan of good music.</p> <p>13. Betty Boo tells an amusing story about Madonna giving her one of her jackets. Madonna was quite keen on Betty Boo at one point in the 1990s, describing her as \"criminally overlooked\" and attempting to sign the cat-headed songstress to her Maverick label.</p> <p>14. Other artists to have been signed to Maverick include Alanis, the Prodigy, Mirwais, and a load of people you have never heard of.</p> <p>15. Norwegian songbird Annie sampled Madonna's Everybody on her debut single, Greatest Hit. Establishing a pattern that continues to plague Annie's career in 2008, the song was not in fact a great hit at all, but was very good indeed.</p> <p>16. Madonna reportedly turned down Prince when he asked her to take the female lead in his Graffiti Bridge movie, because the screenplay was awful. To give you an idea of how bad she thought the screenplay was, films Madonna said yes to include Shanghai Surprise, Swept Away, Dick Tracy, Body of Evidence and The Next Best Thing. She has received Razzie awards for Worst Actress (several times) and Worst Supporting Actress (twice), also being half responsible for winning Worst Screen Couple (twice), and, in 2000, Worst Actress of the Century.</p> <p>17. Madonna has scored 64 (SIXTY FOUR) UK Top 40 hits. That will be a flash, but probably quite expensive, box set when Warners put it out in time for Christmas now that Madge has pissed off to Live Nation.</p> <p>18. Like a Virgin has made a huge impact on British popular culture, and for evidence of this we need only direct our attention toward the Okey Cokey Karaoke episode of sitcom Birds of a Feather in which comedic nymphomaniac Dorien sings the song in a nightclub. It's testament to this set piece's earth shattering amazingness that the directors of the half-hour sitcom opted to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqLWrNfWN8\">include the song from beginning to end</a>. </p> <p>19. At the UK media playback for Confessions on a Dance Floor there were Madonna-branded DJ slipmats. Very clever. Dance floor. DJs. Decks.</p> <p>20. At the UK media playback session for Hard Candy there was a massive mosaic of the album's sleeve, made out of Jelly Belly sweets. Very clever. Candy. Candy.</p> <p>21. Also at the Hard Candy playback was an ocean of free booze which, with hindsight, may go some way to explaining the largely glowing reviews of what, in the cold light of day, turned out to be a deeply underwhelming album that has alienated even some of the singer's hardcore fans. Many of these fans still admire Madonna's continued hunger for success, but feel that in chasing the popular music style of the day rather than setting her own agenda she has, for perhaps the first time, begun to show her age.</p> <p>22. Her age, incidentally, is 50. Hence these 50 amazing facts. Other singers to be 50 this year include Michael Jackson, Prince, Kate Bush and Ice-T. If one were to put them in order of who had grown old the most gracefully, Madonna would be slap bang in the middle.</p> <p>23. Other dishes Madonna cannot cook include Another Fruitcake in Another Hall, Take a Bowl of Porridge, Who's That Grill and What it Feels Like for a Viennese Whirl.</p> <p>24. Madonna's wealth is estimated to be well in excess of $400m, although you can expect this to rocket when the Hard Candy \"millions\" start rolling in.</p> <p>25. During the recording of Hard Candy one of the album's producers, Pharrell Williams, made Madonna cry \"like a baby\".</p> <p>26. It can be stated without any waiting or hesitating that Madonna is not the world's greatest lyricist, although her words do have \"a certain charm\". Her best lyrics are on the Like a Virgin album, but she didn't really write those, except for album track Shoo-Bee-Doo. (Oh dear.)</p> <p>27. Madonna once noted: \"I want to be like Gandhi and Martin Luther King and John Lennon - but I want to stay alive.\"</p> <p>28. A song Madonna quite likes is the Todd Terry remix of Everything But the Girl's Missing.</p> <p>29. The Babyface-produced single Take a Bow remains Madonna's longest-running No 1 single in America \u2013 it topped the charts for seven weeks, but in the UK the ballad ended a 10-year run of consecutive Top 10 singles when it wound up at No 16 around Christmas in 1995. Shouldn't have chucked in some sleigh bells.</p> <p>30. Madonna has had a single in the UK Top 40 every year except 1988, 2004 and 2007. After these \"breaks\" she returned with Like a Prayer in 1989 (amazing), Hung Up in 2005 (amazing) and 4 Minutes in 2008 (sort of amazing).</p> <p>31. Vogue was originally going to be a B-side because Madonna didn't think it would be strong enough to be released as a single.</p> <p>32. Madonna is the best-selling female artist of all time, but you probably could have guessed that.</p> <p>33. Madonna gave her song Love Won't Wait to Gary Barlow for his second solo single which, despite being absolutely terrible, became a No 1 hit single. Madonna's version remains unreleased \u2026</p> <p>34. Film soundtracks on which Madonna appears include Die Another Day, At Close Range, With Honours, The Next Best Thing, A League of Their Own, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and various others.</p> <p>35. American Pie, from The Next Best Thing, is actually brilliant. Although you cannot buy it on iTunes, for some reason.</p> <p>36. In 1982, as Everybody was proving \"big in the clubs\", Madonna auditioned for Fame but didn't get the part of Leroy.</p> <p>37. Madonna's first band was called The Breakfast Club.</p> <p>38. 4 Minutes is actually four minutes and four seconds long \u2013 a disastrous misfire which could have been remedied if Timbaland had increased the song's speed by just one beat per minute.</p> <p>39. Madonna lost her virginity in the back of a Cadillac, later explaining that she saw it as a career move.</p> <p>40. Madonna once stated that she thought her Dick Tracy album I'm Breathless was her best because it was \"different\".</p> <p>41. Ingredients Madonna does not have in her kitchen \u2013 because she cannot cook \u2013 include Cumin Nature, Bedthyme Story, and This Used to Be My Playground Nutmeg.</p> <p>42. The Immaculate Collection is one of the best titles of a greatest hits album in the history of pop.</p> <p>43. It is certainly better than GHV2.</p> <p>44. Earlier this month Madonna's was named the \"ultimate face\" in a New Yorker feature on plastic surgery, with surgeons explaining that hers is one of clients' most sought-after \"visages\".</p> <p>45. Men to have recorded cover versions of Madonna songs include Marilyn Manson (Justify My Love), Marc Almond (Like A Prayer), KMFDM (Material Girl) and Teenage Fanclub (Like a Virgin).</p> <p>46. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Madonna at No 36 in their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time poll. Not bad for a girl, right lads?</p> <p>47. True Blue remains Madonna's most successful album, shifting 24m units.</p> <p>48. Madonna's family own a vineyard in Michigan where one can purchase limited-edition Madonna wine.</p> <p>49. Supernatural, the B-side to Cherish, is about a ghost who has sex with Madonna.</p> <p>50. Back to the cooking, though. Because she cannot cook very well she probably eats a lot of biscuits. One can imagine her emerging from a kitchen brandishing a plate containing including a Bourbonline and a Guy Richtea. Maybe there would be a choc ice, too, but she'd bring that out later because it's Frozen. She is certainly not a True Cordon Bleu. You might even (That's quite enough of that \u2013 Ed)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2008/jul/30/madonna.popandrock?picture=336082414\"><em>See a picture for every year Madonna's been alive!</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Man-made pollution is spreading a growing number of suffocating dead zones across the world's seas with disastrous consequences for marine life, scientists have warned.</p> <p>The experts say the hundreds of regions of critically low oxygen now affect a combined area the size of New Zealand, and that they pose as great a threat to life in the world's oceans as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/11/fishing.food\">overfishing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/conservation.forests\">habitat loss</a>.</p> <p>The number of such seabed zones \u2013 caused when massive algal blooms feeding off pollutants such as fertiliser die and decay \u2013 has boomed in the last decade. There were some 405 recorded in coastal waters worldwide in 2007, up from 305 in 1995 and 162 in the 1980s.</p> <p>Robert Diaz, an oceans expert at the US Virginia Institute of Marine Science, College of William and Mary, at Gloucester Point, said: \"Dead zones were once rare. Now they're commonplace. There are more of them in more places.\"</p> <p>Marine bacteria feed on the algae in the blooms after it has died and sunk to the bottom, and in doing so they use up all of the oxygen dissolved in the water. The resulting 'hypoxic' seabed zones can asphyxiate swathes of bottom dwelling organisms such as clams and worms, and disrupt fish populations.</p> <p>Diaz and his colleague, Rutger Rosenberg of the department of marine ecology at the University of Gothenburg, call for more careful use of fertilisers to address the problem. </p> <p>Writing in the journal Science, the researchers say the dead zones must be viewed as one of the \"major global environmental problems\". They say: \"There is no other variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically over such a short time.\"</p> <p>The key solution, they say, is to \"keep fertilisers on the land and out of the sea\". Changes in the way fertilisers and other pollutants are managed on land have already \"virtually eliminated\" dead zones from the Mersey and Thames estuaries, they say.</p> <p>Diaz says his concern is shared by farmers who are worried about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/12/biofuels.food\">high cost of fertilisers</a>. \"They certainly don't want to see their dollars flowing off their fields. Scientists and farmers need to continue working together to minimise the transfer of nutrients from land to sea.\"</p> <p>The number of dead zones reported has doubled each decade since the 1960s, but the scientists say they are often ignored until they provoke problems among populations of larger creatures such as fish or lobsters. By killing or stunting the growth of bottom-dwelling organisms, the lack of oxygen denies food to creatures higher up the food chain.</p> <p>The Baltic Sea, site of the world's largest dead zone, has lost about 30% of its available food energy, which has led to a significant decline in its fisheries.</p> <p>The lack of oxygen can also force fish into warmer waters closer to the surface, perhaps making them more susceptible to disease.</p> <p>The size of marine dead zones often fluctuates with the seasons. A massive dead zone, some 8,000 square miles across, forms each summer in the Gulf of Mexico as floodwater flushes nitrogen-rich fertiliser into the Mississippi River. </p> <p>Experts said it was slightly smaller than expected this year because Hurricane Dolly stirred up the water. Dead zones require the water to be separated into layers, with little or no mixing between.</p> <p>As well as fertilisers rich in nitrates and phosphates, sewage discharges also contribute to the problem because they help the algal blooms to flourish.</p> <p>Diaz and Rosenberg say: \"We believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre-industrial levels of nutrient input [to oceans], but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century,\" before the rise in added nutrients began to spread dead zones globally.</p> <p>Climate change could be adding to the problem. Many regions are expected to experience more severe periods of heavy rain, which could wash more nutrients from farmland into rivers.</p> <p>In May, scientists reported that oxygen-depleted zones in tropical oceans are expanding. They analysed oxygen levels in samples of seawater and found the effect was largest in the central and eastern tropical Atlantic and the equatorial Pacific. The increase could push oxygen-starved zones closer to the surface and give marine life such as fish less room to live and look for food. </p> <p>The scientists, led by Lothar Stramma from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel, Germany, say the change could be linked to warming seas. At 0C, a litre of seawater can hold about 10ml of dissolved oxygen; at 25C this falls to 4ml. Stramma said: \"Whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved.\" The reduction could also be down to natural processes working on shorter timescales, he said.</p>",
  "<p>High petrol prices are the fault of the Financial Services Authority, according to a former US regulator.</p> <p>Joining the debate about the role of speculators in the price of oil, Michael Greenberger, formerly of the commodity futures trading commission and now a professor at the University of Maryland, accused the City regulator of letting \"the British people down\".</p> <p>\"If the FSA adopted limits on speculation, you would see the price of gasoline drop in the United Kingdom,\" he said.</p> <p>His remarks to BBC Radio 4 come as the FSA's approach to regulation is being contrasted with US regulators' insistence that they are on watch for speculators trying to manipulate the price of oil. The CFTC has also insisted that the London exchange ICE, on which oil futures contracts are traded, should set limits on the positions that can be taken by traders.</p> <p>At a US Senate hearing in June, Greenberger claimed that \"at least 70%\" of the crude oil market is driven by speculators. The producers' cartel Opec has also said oil prices were being pushed up by speculators, though this has been disputed by energy companies, which blame a lack of supply.</p> <p>The FSA has insisted there is no evidence of speculators manipulating oil prices. Adair Turner, who chairs the government's committee on climate change and is to chair the FSA, has told MPs on the Treasury select committee there is \"no large accumulation of evidence that speculation is playing a major role\". </p> <p>The FSA is sending daily trading records on the ICE to the CFTC, an improvement on the weekly records it sent until recently. A spokeswoman for the FSA said relations with the CFTC were \"very good\".</p>",
  "<p>The seventies rock star and convicted child abuser Gary Glitter is to be deported to Britain next week as soon as he is released from jail in Vietnam after serving almost three years.</p> <p>The 64-year-old singer, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, was convicted of obscene acts with two Vietnamese girls aged 10 and 11 in the coastal city of Vang Tau in March 2006.</p> <p>When he lands in Britain Glitter will be interviewed by the police and required to sign the sex offenders' register. He will then have to tell police where he intends to live and notify them if he moves.</p> <p>He may also be monitored by police and the probation service.</p> <p>Le Thanh Kinh, Glitter's solicitor, said the former singer told him a few months ago he had no desire to go back to Britain, but Vietnamese law required he be sent back to his native country.</p> <p>\"Police booked his ticket from Ho Chi Minh City to London and I have paid for the ticket on his behalf,\" said the lawyer.</p> <p>A Vietnamese foreign ministry spokesman, Le Dung, confirmed Glitter was not welcome to stay in the country. His sentence carries a requirement for mandatory deportation. But the spokesman said it was up to him which country he travelled to.</p> <p>Two months ago Glitter told a Vietnamese state newspaper he wanted to travel to Singapore or Hong Kong when released.</p> <p>In the interview with Cong An Nanh (People's Police) newspaper from prison he said he wanted to release a new album and resume his singing career that peaked in 1973.</p> <p>Glitter has served his time in Thu Duc prison north of Ho Chi Minh City, but spent a week in hospital earlier this year after complaining of chest pains.</p> <p>He was convicted of possessing child pornography in the UK in 1999 and served half of a four-month sentence before he moved to Cambodia.</p> <p>But he was expelled from Cambodia after his presence caused uproar and the government deemed he posed \"a threat to the security of a country\".</p> <p>He was arrested in November 2005 as he tried to board a flight to Thailand from Ho Chi Minh City. Glitter was arrested on suspicion of rape of minors, though he was only charged with obscene acts.</p> <p>Glitter had a string of hits in the 1970s including I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am). He was known for his silver jump suits, platform heels and exuberant dancing.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"We do not comment on individual cases.\"</p>",
  "<p>A 235 metre skyscraper which has been dubbed the Cheesegrater became the latest victim of the economic downturn yesterday, raising doubts about the future of such landmark projects.</p> <p>The planned 47-storey development in the heart of the City at 122 Leadenhall Street, between the Gherkin and Lloyd's of London, was scheduled for completion by September 2011. But, faced with a slowing economy and shrinking demand for office space in London, the developer, British Land, has pushed back completion of the project until at least 2012.</p> <p>Like the Shard at London Bridge, which has also suffered credit woes, the Cheesegrater was set to change London's skyline. It got its nickname from its wedge shape, designed by Lord Rogers to stop it obscuring views of St Paul's cathedral.</p> <p>British Land chief executive Stephen Hester said he was holding off from signing construction contracts because he believed the market for London office space would decline during 2008 and 2009.</p> <p>With prices of steel and energy also coming down, Hester said he would wait until the construction industry is really feeling the pinch and the worst of the downturn is over. </p> <p>\"By waiting until 2011 to start looking for tenants, a year before we finish the project, we will be further into the recovery and should get higher rates,\" he said.</p> <p>The previous building at 122 Leadenhall Street, a 1960s office block, is being destroyed from the ground up around its central concrete core. For some time it resembled an ice-lolly, but now the floors have gone and only the \"stick\" remains on the site. </p> <p>Demolition work continued at the site yesterday. A sign pinned to the barriers that prevent office workers and shoppers from toppling into the huge hole left by the excavation promised \"57,000 square metres of the highest quality office space\".</p> <p>Hester would not say exactly how long the Cheesegrater would be left on hold, but it could be at least six months. Analysts, who broadly supported the move, predicted a delay of at least 12 months.</p> <p>Hester said the economic slump meant that rules of the construction industry had changed. \"Today you would never start such a big project without a tenant already lined up. The economics are not attractive enough,\" he said. </p> <p>He also predicted that other construction projects would be delayed by the declining office rental market.</p> <p>\"It's already happening, but in a less public way than with Leadenhall Street,\" he said, speaking after British Land reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a3572m in the three months to June 30 and cut the value of its property portfolio by 5%.</p> <p>The Shard, which at 306 metres will soar even higher than the Cheesegrater, has suffered its own setbacks after the project hit funding problems. Having been scheduled for completion in 2011, it will probably not be fully finished until the following year.</p> <p>\"By the first quarter of 2012, we hope it will be done and dusted,\" a spokesman for the Shard project said yesterday.</p> <p>The skyscrapers that are destined to change London's skyline in the next few years were approved when Ken Livingstone was the city's mayor. </p> <p>His successor, Boris Johnson, is much less keen on these multi-storey buildings, and experts believe property developers could face a much tougher struggle getting approval for future Shards Cheesegraters and Gherkins.</p> <p>The delays to the Cheesegrater may please Prince Charles. In February he warned that the current fashion for skyscrapers meant a \"rash of carbuncles\" was sweeping historical cities such as London.</p> <p>But Hester insisted that skyscrapers still had a future despite the economic troubles that are expected to lead to tens of thousands of job cuts across the City of London, and many more in the wider economy.</p> <p>\"If the economy is to grow then employment needs to grow, so we need to create more space for people to work. </p> <p>\"If we don't want to build on green fields then we need to get more people into the same space, and that means taller buildings,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this week, Nugzari Jashavili was walking across fields to his house in the Georgian village of Tkviavi. Some 50 metres away, he spotted gunmen approaching his neighbour Gela Chikladze.</p> <p>\"They grabbed him round the shoulder and slit his throat,\" Jashavili said. \"There were five of them. They had arrived from South Ossetia in a jeep. They were going across the village from house to house.\"</p> <p>Jashavili, 65, said he hid in a cornfield. He watched the Chechen and Ossetian irregulars help themselves to his furniture and 100-watt generator. Further down the road, he said, they shot his cousin Koba. They also executed another man, Shamila Okropridze.</p> <p>The irregulars had come from the Russian-controlled South Ossetian capital, Tskinvali, five miles (8km) away. According to the villagers' accounts, the militias, with the apparent support of the Russian army, began a campaign of ethnic cleansing, killing teenage boys, stealing vehicles, looting and burning.</p> <p>There is no way to independently verify these accounts.</p> <p>Russia's president, Dmitry Medevdev, had just announced a ceasefire and a putative end to Moscow's war with Georgia. But fleeing villagers say the Russian-backed militias were exacting revenge on Georgians on both sides of the South Ossetian border north of Gori.</p> <p>\"There are bodies everywhere. I saw hundreds of dead. There are people lying in the streets,\" Elene Maisuradze, 73, said. \"The villages of Kurta, Chala and Eredvi are full of corpses.\"</p> <p>She fled from Tkviavi after gunmen arrived at her home. \"They said in Russian: 'Where are the boys and where is your car?' I didn't understand. One of them was Ossetian and he translated. I told them I'd sold my car and they went away. But then some others turned up.</p> <p>\"They asked me where my basement was, and shot it up. I was crying. They said: 'Kill her, kill her.' My neighbour is a Russian woman and she told them: 'Don't do this.' They fired into the ground instead and said, 'Fuck Saakashvili.'\"</p> <p>It took time for these accounts to emerge, the two days it took for Maisuradze, Jashavili and other survivors to reach Gori on foot. They say they survived by eating peaches, apples and plums; one old woman died on the way.</p> <p>They arrived at the edge of the city yesterday morning, at the same time as the Georgian military. Georgian forces were supposed to take back control of Gori. In reality, the Russian army is refusing to leave, blockading the entrance to the town and the road north with dozens of tanks.</p> <p>While negotiations took place between a Russian general and Georgia's national security adviser, in the nearby mountains black smoke poured from a burning Georgian military base. Every few minutes there was a rumbling explosion. The air smelled of cordite.</p> <p>Negotiations broke down yesterday after the Russians insisted that the South Ossetians run Gori's police force. Local radio stations had been replaced by a Russian channel, My Family, which broadcasts dating tips in Russian.</p> <p>\"My husband died 14 years ago. I wished I had died soon after him,\" Maisuradze said yesterday. She said the gunmen had taken hostage two men with Georgian surnames. Yesterday she was still trudging to Tbilisi. \"I had my childhood during the second world war. The situation was terrible. Now I'm so old and I'm in a war again.\"</p>",
  "<p>The rapidly changing face of the American people is revealed in new census projections that predict that groups that are now labelled minorities will form the greater part of the country's population by 2042.</p> <p>According to the US census bureau, the dominance of non-Hispanic white people, who today account for two-thirds of Americans, will be whittled away, falling steadily to less than half in 2042 and 46% by 2050. In the opposite trajectory, those who describe themselves as Hispanic, black, Asian and Native American will increase in proportion from about a third now to 54% by 2050.</p> <p>Such a rapid demographical shift is in tune with trends that have been seen for some time, but it is happening much faster than experts had predicted even four years ago.</p> <p>Demographers see it as among the most intensive changes of a country's racial and ethnic make-up in history, every bit as dramatic as the huge influx of Italian, Irish and east European immigrants that transformed the US in the early 20th century.</p> <p>\"The new projections move up some of the changes that are happening. The minority population now will become the majority eight or nine years earlier than we had thought,\" said David Waddington, who heads the census bureau's population projections team.</p> <p>The shift in majority status from non-Hispanic whites, who have enjoyed the dominant position since European settlers from England, the Netherlands and elsewhere overtook the Spanish and Native American population centuries ago, is likely to have profound implications. In the long term, it could prompt a sea-change in the country's understanding of its politics and culture. More immediately, it is likely to inform debates on immigration policy and reshape the electoral landscape.</p> <p>Two underlying factors are strongly at play in the new projections. The first is that the overall population of the country is growing faster than expected. It passed the 300 million-mark in October 2006, and is projected to cross the 400 million landmark by 2039. By 2050 it will reach 439 million.</p> <p>That extraordinary rate of growth is in turn fuelling the second main underlying factor, which is the huge increase in the US Hispanic population. In the census bureau definition, Hispanic refers to a person's description of their origin in places such as Mexico or South America, rather than their race.</p> <p>The projections suggest that the Hispanic population will increase from 15% of the population today to almost a third by 2050, almost tripling in size from 47 million to 133 million. By contrast, the non-Hispanic white population is expected to remain relatively steady numerically, barely rising from 200 million to 203 million. For the first time in US history, the white population will lose numbers between 2030 and 2040.</p> <p>Of the other main groups, the black population is projected to remain relatively stable in proportional terms, rising from 14% of the population today to 15% in 2050, from 41 million to 66 million.</p> <p>The Asian population is projected to climb more sharply, from 16 million, or 5%, to 41 million, or 9%.</p> <p>The impact of the changes is likely to be further magnified by the seismic change in the country's age profile that will occur simultaneously. As the baby-boomer generation passes into older age it is causing an extreme bulge, like the shape of a snake's torso after eating a rabbit. Over-65s are 12% of the US population this year, but by 2050 they will comprise one in five Americans.</p> <p>Cross-tabulate those figures with the racial and ethnic composition of the nation and the results are even more striking. The growth in minority groups is heavily focused on younger age groups. They already account for 45% of American children under 18, and that proportion will rise to 62% by 2050.</p> <p>\"It means there's going to be a young-old divide,\" said William Frey, a demographer at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. Frey points out that young adults aged 18 to 29 are already the most ethnically and racially diverse, and as a group have tended to back Barack Obama in this year's election.

  "<p>British Airways unveiled an alliance with American Airlines and Spain's Iberia yesterday that will allow the three carriers to agree fares and schedules - prompting warnings from rival Virgin Atlantic that passengers will face higher ticket prices.</p> <p>BA must convince officials in Washington and Brussels that the agreement to cooperate on flights between North America, Mexico and Europe will not lead to fare rises and distort the crucial London-New York market. Virgin Atlantic laid down a marker as the deal's most vehement opponent yesterday, when the airline's founder, Sir Richard Branson, warned yesterday that the alliance would be a \"monster monopoly\".</p> <p>BA's chief executive, Willie Walsh, said the partnership would give British customers more reliable and cheaper journeys to American destinations. \"There is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this. For the consumer, it means they will have access to a much bigger network. We will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares,\" he said. </p> <p>Passengers on transatlantic routes would be able to choose between BA and AA fares when booking flights, Walsh said, allowing them to select the cheapest fare for both legs of a return journey. \"There will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with AA outbound and taking a fare with BA on the inbound leg.\"</p> <p>It is the third attempt by BA to forge an alliance with the second-largest airline in the US, six years after the previous attempt foundered when the European commission demanded the sale of 32 take-off and landing slots at Heathrow as a concession.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, BA's fiercest rival in the UK-US market, warned that the deal would give BA and AA control over nearly two-thirds of one of the most lucrative markets in aviation: Heathrow to New York's JFK airport. \"Make no mistake, if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers. It will still be bad for passengers, bad for competition, and bad for the UK and US aviation industry,\" said Branson.</p> <p>Walsh hit back, claiming that the airline industry was now \"completely different\" because the recent liberalisation of the transatlantic airline market had created a competitive market in Heathrow-US flights. The Open Skies treaty in March replaced an agreement that limited the Heathrow-JFK route to four airlines. \"This is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001. Anybody can come in and compete,\" said Walsh, who added that nine airlines now operated between Heathrow and the US.</p> <p>BA is the biggest carrier at Heathrow, owning 42% of the take-off and landing slots, but Walsh ruled out selling some to appease regulators. BA will argue that two global airline alliances, Skyteam and Star Alliance, already have anti-trust immunity for transatlantic flights, allowing Air France-KLM and Germany's Lufthansa to cooperate over capacity, scheduling, networks and fares with their respective partners, United Airlines and Delta.</p> <p>\"We have seen Open Skies and we have seen the effects,\" Walsh said. \"The other two alliances have anti-trust immunity. The issue of competition between the alliances is much more relevant than it was in 2001 and we have a changed industry environment. Things have changed sufficiently for us to apply with confidence this time.\"</p> <p>Walsh added that there had been no preliminary discussions with AA over a full-blown merger, which is currently prohibited under ownership guidelines. BA is already in merger discussions with Iberia to form a \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.96bn) airline but the deal could take up to a year to complete.</p> <p>The flag carriers Finnair and Royal Jordanian are also applying for anti-trust immunity as part of the alliance, but the inquiry by the US department of transportation and the EU competition directorate is expected to focus on the transatlantic market.</p> <p>Discussing commercially sensitive information such as fares and scheduling between airlines is illegal unless it is given prior blessing by competition authorities. Without anti-trust clearance, carriers can face price-fixing charges, as BA found when it was fined more than \u00a3270m by US and UK regulators last year for colluding with Virgin Atlantic over fuel surcharges.</p>",
  "<p>Russia's invasion of Georgia strikes at the heart of western values and our 21st-century system of security. If the international community allows Russia to crush our democratic, independent state, it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere. Russia intends to destroy not just a country, but an idea.</p> <p>For too long we underestimated the ruthlessness of the regime in Moscow. Within 24 hours of agreeing to a ceasefire, Russia's forces were rampaging through Gori; blocking the port of Poti; sinking Georgian vessels; and - worst of all - brutally purging Georgian villages in South Ossetia. The Russian leadership cannot be trusted - and this hard reality should guide the west's response. Only western peacekeepers can end the war.</p> <p>Russia also seeks to destroy our economy and is bombing factories, ports and other vital sites. Accordingly, we need to establish a modern version of the Berlin airlift. The United Nations, the US, Canada and others are moving in this direction, for which we are deeply grateful.</p> <p>As we consider what to do next, understanding Moscow's goals is critical. It aims to satisfy its imperialist ambitions, to erase one of the few democratic, law-governed states in its vicinity - and, above all, to demolish the post-cold war system of international relations in Europe. It is showing that it can do as it pleases. </p> <p>The historical parallels are stark: Russia's war on Georgia echoes events in Finland in 1939, Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. Perhaps this is why so many eastern European countries, which suffered under Soviet occupation, have voiced their support for us. Russia's leaders see us as a threat because Georgia is a free country whose people have elected to integrate into the Euro-Atlantic community. But Russia's rulers do not want their nation or its borders contaminated by democratic ideas.</p> <p>Since our democratic government came to power after the 2003 Rose revolution, Russia has used economic embargoes and closed borders to isolate us, and has illegally deported thousands of Georgians. It has tried to destabilise us politically with the help of criminal oligarchs. It has tried to freeze us into submission by blowing up vital gas pipelines in midwinter. When all that failed to shake the Georgian people's resolve, Russia invaded.</p> <p>Last week Russia, using its separatist proxies, attacked several peaceful, Georgian-controlled villages in South Ossetia. On August 6, just hours after a senior Georgian official travelled to South Ossetia to attempt negotiations, a massive assault was launched on Georgian settlements. Even as we came under attack, I declared a unilateral ceasefire in the hope of avoiding escalation, and announced our willingness to talk to the separatists by any means.</p> <p>But we then learned that columns of Russian tanks and troops had crossed Georgia's sovereign borders. The thousands of troops, tanks and artillery massed on our border are evidence of how long Russia had been planning this aggression. Our government had no choice but to protect the country from invasion, secure our citizens and stop the bloodshed. </p> <p>For years Georgia has been proposing 21st-century, European solutions for South Ossetia, including full autonomy guaranteed by the international community. Russia has responded with crude, 19th-century methods.</p> <p>It is true that Russian power could overwhelm our small country - though even we did not anticipate the ferocity and scale of Moscow's response. However, we had to try to protect our people: any democratic country would have done the same.</p> <p>Facing this brutal invading army, our government decided to withdraw from South Ossetia, declare a ceasefire and seek negotiations. However repeated attempts to contact senior Russian leaders were rebuffed. Russia's foreign ministry even denied receiving our notice of ceasefire hours after it was officially - and very publicly - delivered. This was just one of many cynical ploys to deceive the world and justify further attacks.</p> <p>This war threatens not only Georgia but security and liberty around the world. If the international community fails to take a resolute stand, it will sound the death knell for the spread of freedom and democracy everywhere. Georgia's only fault in this crisis is its wish to be an independent, free and democratic country. What would western nations do if they were punished for the same aspiration?</p> <p>I have staked my country's fate on the west's rhetoric about democracy and liberty. As Georgians come under attack, we must ask: if the west is not with us, who is it with? If the line is not drawn now, when will it be drawn? We cannot allow Georgia to become the first victim of a new world order as imagined by Moscow.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mikheil Saakashvili is the president of Georgia </p> <p>\u00a9 Washington Post</p>",
  "<p>The rapidly changing face of the American people is revealed in new census projections that predict that groups who are now labelled minorities will form the greater part of the nation's population by 2042.</p> <p>According to the US Census bureau, the dominance of white people excluding Hispanics, who today account for two-thirds of Americans, will be whittled away, falling steadily to less than half in 2042 and 46% by 2050. In the opposite trajectory, those who describe themselves as Hispanics, blacks, Asians and native groups will increase in proportion from about a third now to 54% by 2050.</p> <p>Such a rapid shift in the composition of the American people is in tune with trends that have been underway for some time, but it is happening much faster than experts predicted even four years ago. Demographers see it as among the most intensive changes of a country's racial and ethnic make-up in history, every bit as dramatic as the huge influx of Italians, Irish and East Europeans that transformed America in the early 20th century.</p> <p>\"The new projections move up some of the changes that are happening. The minority population now will become the majority eight or nine years earlier than we had thought,\" said David Waddington, who heads the Census Bureau's population projections team.</p> <p>The mere shift in majority status from non-Hispanic whites, who have enjoyed the dominant position since European settlers from England, the Netherlands and elsewhere overtook the Spanish and native American population centuries ago, is likely to have profound implications. In the long term, it could prompt a sea-change in the American understanding of its politics and culture.</p> <p>More immediately, it is likely to inform debates on immigration policy and reshape the electoral landscape.</p> <p>Two underlying factors are strongly at play in the new projections. The first is that the overall population of the country is growing faster than expected.</p> <p>It past the 300m-mark in October 2006, and is projected to cross the 400m landmark as early as 2039. By 2050 it will reach 439m.</p> <p>That extraordinary rate of growth is in turn fuelling the second main underlying factor, which is the huge increase in the US Hispanic population. In the Census Bureau definition, Hispanic refers to a person's description of their origins in places such as Mexico or South America, rather than their race.</p> <p>The projections suggest Hispanics will increase from 15% of the population today to almost a third by 2050. That would involve a numerical tripling, from 47m to 133m over the same period.</p> <p>By contrast, the non-Hispanic white population remains relatively steady numerically, rising barely from 200m to 203m. For the first time in American history, whites will lose population in the 2030s and 2040s.</p> <p>Of the other main groups, the black population remains relatively stable in proportional terms, rising from 14% of the population today to 15% in 2050, a numerical increase from 41m to 66m.</p> <p>The Asian population is projected to climb more sharply from 16m or 5% to 41m or 9%.</p> <p>The impact of the changes is likely to be further magnified by the seismic change in the country's age profile that is happening simultaneously. As the baby boomer generation passes through into older age it is causing an extreme bulge, like the shape of a snake's torso after eating a rabbit. Over 65s are 12% of the US population this year, but by 2050 they will expand to one in five of Americans.</p> <p>Cross-tabulate those figures with the racial and ethnic composition of the nation and the results are even more striking. The growth in minority groups is heavily focused on younger age groups.</p> <p>They already account for 45% of American children, aged under 18, and that proportion will rise to 62% by 2050.</p> <p>\"It means there's going to be a young-old divide,\" said William Frey, a demographer at the Washington-based Brookings Institution.</p> <p>Frey points out that young adults aged 18 to 29 are already the most ethnically and racially diverse, and as a group are tending to back Barack Obama in this year's election. By the presidential election of 2028 Hispanics, blacks and Asians will be in the majority within that age range.</p> <p>\"But the over 65s will primarily remain white and will stay that way.<br>The challenge for any national politician will be appealing to such diverse interests at both ends of the spectrum.\"</p> <p>The Census Bureau points out that its projections are based on assumptions about future births, deaths, immigration from abroad and internal migration that it has extrapolated from trends over the past 20 years. Those factors could change, particularly the rate of immigration which is already a matter of heated debate across the country.</p>",
  "<p>Texans - or at least <a href=\"http://www.governor.state.tx.us/about\">governor Rick Perry</a> and his supporters - seem to love the death penalty almost as much as flying the state flag. And last week, the good ol' Texan bloodlust came under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/06/usa\">international scrutiny</a> once again when the state put to death a man born in Mexico, where capital punishment is prohibited.</p> <p>During the trial of death row inmate Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Medell\u00edn, he was not given the opportunity to seek legal help from Mexican consulates, a right granted under the 1963 Vienna Convention. Appeals from all over the world - including <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ifumpfom5_ZgZdYRyQFgWoF7ixygD91URU080\">one from the UN's International Court of Justice</a> and another from President Bush himself - pointed out the discrepancy and asked the state to delay the execution till Medell\u00edn's case could be further reviewed. But Perry refused to put on the brakes, and Medell\u00edn <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gpkdpV0pGSS_ozv30DC1F1QkVd5wD92CHCNG5\">died of a lethal injection</a> on August 6.</p> <p>\"Texans are doing just fine governing Texas,\" Perry said last year in response to the European Union's request that he reconsider another death row case involving a young man who had never been accused of directly participating in the murder to which he was linked. Given Perry's audacity, perhaps it's no surprise he has single-handedly <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-01-06-execution_x.htm\">overseen more executions</a> than any other governor in the country since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. He also vetoed a ban on the execution of mentally handicapped inmates in 2002. And since 1976, Texas has carried out more executions than any other state: 409 - more than four times as many as Virginia, its nearest competitor, with 99.</p> <p>At the same time, it's not that difficult to understand why Perry might not have been terribly sympathetic to Medell\u00edn: There seems to be no question that the Mexican took part in the raping and killing of two teenage girls in 1993 as part of a gang initiation rite. But the story of a young man named <a href=\"http://www.savejeffwood.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1\">Jeff Wood</a>, set to be put to death on August 21, more poignantly highlights the injustices of the Texan judicial system. </p> <p>Despite the fact that the death penalty is supposedly reserved for only the most heinous crimes, Wood is <a href=\"http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/29949/\">sentenced to death</a> for a murder that prosecutors have never accused him of committing - one that took place when he wasn't even in the same building. Rather, he was outside in a gas station parking lot, waiting in a pick-up truck for his buddy, Daniel Reneau, to come out of a road-side store with drinks and snacks. Wood contends that he didn't know Reneau was planning to rob the store - a frequent hang-out spot for the two of them - and that he also had no idea Reneau was going to murder the store clerk, Kris Keeran, a friend of both men.</p> <p>But after hearing a shot ring out on the morning of January 2, 1996, Wood ran inside and saw Keeran laying dead from a single .22-calibre bullet that entered between his eye and his nose. Reneau was holding the gun, which he then turned on Wood, ordering him to grab the store's surveillance video. Wood - who suffers from learning disabilities and mental problems as a result of severe physical abuse during his childhood - complied. Reneau took the store's safe, and the two of them fled to Wood's brother house.</p> <p>Wood and Reneau <em>had</em> talked with the manager of the store about robbing the place on New Year's Day, when the register would be full of money from the night before. But after Wood backed out, he assumed, since he heard no more about it, that the robbery plan was kaput. Instead, Reneau decided to go through with it on his own. Wood contends he had no idea Reneau was even packing a gun at the time of the robbery.</p> <p>Reneau was executed for the murder in 2002. But thanks to the Texas \"<a href=\"http://texasdeathpenalty.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=59\">Law of Parties</a>\", anyone who conspires with another person or a group to commit one crime (like robbery) and happens to commit another crime in the process (like murder) can be found guilty of the secondary crime - even if the individual in question wasn't directly involved in planning it or carrying it out. And when the secondary crime <em>is</em> murder, that person can also be put to death for it. That's the state's justification for why Wood is on death row - except, of course, that Wood claims he wasn't involved in planning the robbery and that he would never have helped Reneau try to get away with it if Reneau hadn't trained a gun on him. As such, there's been a huge public outcry in support of Wood; the second of two rallies this month to draw attention to his plight will take place on Saturday, August 16.</p> <p>Wood's situation is similar to another recent case in Texas, that of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/us/30execute.html?pagewanted=print\">Kenneth Foster</a> - the one that drew the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14124188\">attention of the European Union</a>. Like Wood, Foster did not participate in the actual murder he was sentenced to die for. Like Wood, Foster did not hold a gun at any point while the crime he was linked to was committed. Like Wood, Foster has maintained \u2013 convincingly - that he had no foreknowledge the murder was going to happen. Like Wood, Foster was forced to drive the \"get-away\" car. <br> Following demands from around the world that Texas review the Foster case, the Texas board of pardons and paroles recommended that his sentence be commuted - a rare occurrence. Even more unusually, Governor Perry actually took the board's advice and, three hours before Foster's execution was set to happen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/30/usa.haroonsiddique\">stopped it</a>: the first time in nearly seven years in office that he had done so (excluding cases in which Supreme Court rulings had barred the execution of juveniles and the mentally disabled).</p> <p>Will Perry commute the sentence this time, for Wood, like he did for Foster? The cases are so similar that there seems to be hope that he will. Then again, when announcing his decision in the Foster case, Perry didn't mention how problematic the Law of Parties is; instead, he cited a procedural flaw. (Foster was tried simultaneously with the guy convicted of the actual murder; that's what Perry referred to after commuting his sentence.) So who knows. </p> <p>But maybe Perry and the state of Texas should finally start to think about how unconstitutional it is to execute someone based on the Law of Parties. After all, in their 1982 ruling in the case of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enmund_v._Florida\">Enmund v Florida</a>, the Supreme Court found it was unconstitutional to execute the driver of a get-away car in an armed robbery. The court's rationale was that the eighth amendment forbids imposing capital punishment on someone \"who aids and abets a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force will be employed\". Why can't Texas see that by using the \"Law of Parties\" as a justification for execution, they are not just aiding and abetting but planning and carrying out pre-meditated murders which should not be occurring - and contributing to a cycle of violence and injustice?</p>",

  "<p><br>Daniel Barenboim conducts the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra during rehearsals for this year's Proms. Photograph: Ian West/PA</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/15/musicnews.classicalmusic\">Daniel Barenboim</a> will take the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/proms\">Proms</a> by storm tonight with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/interactive/2008/jul/13/israelandthepalestinians\">West-Eastern Divan Orchestra</a>, the Arab-Israeli ensemble he and Edward Said founded in 1999. </p> <p>Good programmes, too: a chance to hear Schoenberg's Variations for Orchestra Op 31 and Brahms' Symphony No 4 in the main evening concert (two pieces that are really musical blood brothers: just think of the concentration of the Passacaglia, the final movement of the Brahms; music that's as abstract, constructivist, and self-referential as anything in the Schoenberg Variations - which also happens to be one of the most impassioned things that Arnold, the godfather of new music, ever wrote). There's an enticing late-night Prom as well, with iconoclastic French director <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Ch%C3%A9reau\">Patrice Ch\u00e9reau</a> narrating Stravinsky's Soldier's Tale as well as the amuse-bouche of Pierre Boulez's M\u00e9moriale.</p> <p>Here in Lucerne, Switzerland, I watched Paul Smaczny's revelatory documentary on the history of the West-Eastern Divan, <a href=\"http://www.knowledge-is-the-beginning.com/\">Knowledge is the Beginning</a>, a couple of nights ago (the sort of high-minded cultural programming that seems to make up the round-midnight schedules of a lot of TV channels here, rather more than on my freeview package at home).</p> <p>In the film, Barenboim's integrity, bravery, and bloody-minded persistence drive the young Israeli and Arab players on a journey from Weimar to Ramallah, from Seville to the Royal Albert Hall. But there is sadness and frustration, too; the fact that the players can't play in Israel, and the parlous state of music education in Palestine, a situation that the <a href=\"http://www.barenboim-said.org/index.php?id=&amp;idioma=2\">Barenboim-Said Foundation</a> has been doing its best to change since Barenboim helped found a youth orchestra there in 2004.</p> <p>Whatever its ideals, the West-Eastern Divan still contains only a handful of Palestinians in its ranks (most of the Arab players come from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan), and that's always going to be the case unless grassroots musical opportunities improve in Palestine. And in London tomorrow afternoon at the Wigmore Hall, you can hear how one British organisation is working with young Palestinians to do just that, in a concert with the <a href=\"http://www.choiroflondon.org/Choir%20of%20London/Home.html\">Choir of London</a> (a misleadingly metropolitan moniker; as well as making successful recordings of John Tavener, they've been putting together projects in the Middle East since 2004). This free gig, at 3pm, will showcase the fruits of its bursary scheme, which has allowed four young Palestinian musicians the chance to live and train in London, at the Royal Academy of Music.</p> <p>Where the Arab members of the West-Eastern Divan often come from privileged, middle-class backgrounds, the four musicians who will play tomorrow at the Wigmore Hall are from Ramallah, Bethlehem, and the <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/tag/al-amari-refugee-camp/\">al-Amari refugee camp</a> - places that are, as Clemency Burton-Hill, one of the Choir of London's founders, puts it, \"desperately poor, hamstrung by an illegal occupation that can turn a \"simple\" trip to a violin lesson into a traumatic, checkpoint-riddled, road-blocked odyssey\".</p> <p>This isn't a one-off idea, either: last year, the Choir of London was one of major partners in the <a href=\"http://www.palestinemusicfestivals.org/Palestine%20Mozart%20Festival/Home.html\">Palestine Mozart festival</a>, and gave the first ever fully-staged professional performance of an opera in Palestine: Mozart's Magic Flute, directed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_West\">Samuel West</a>.</p> <p>The climax of tomorrow afternoon's concert is a new composition by the four Palestinian players; a piece that you can only hope will become a metaphor for the start of new musical opportunities for the young musicians at home in Palestine, so that their dreams - and those of Barenboim and the Choir of London - can become reality.</p>",

  "<p>America is <a href=\"http://us.cnn.com/2008/US/08/13/census.minorities/index.html\">becoming older and less white</a>. So says the country's <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/\">Census Bureau</a> which predicts today that the various ethnic groups still referred to in the US as minorities will in fact be in a majority before too long.</p> <p>Currently making up about a third of the US population, non-whites will comprise more than half the country by 2042, it predicts, hitting 54% by 2050.</p> <p>Why? Well, it's because the minority populations, particularly Hispanics, tend to be younger than the whites and are producing considerably more children.</p> <p>As the overall US population soars from just over 300m to well over 400m in the coming decades the number of non-Hispanic, single-race white inhabitants will rise marginally and then actually fall as more of their increasingly aged number die than are born or move to the country.</p> <p>In contrast, the population of Hispanics is forecast by the bureau to nearly triple by 2050, going up, from about one in six people to one in three.</p> <p>Experts say the demographic shift will have equally momentous implications for US politics. </p> <p>William H Frey of the Brookings Institution thinktank <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/13/AR2008081303524.html\">tells the Washington Post</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Politically, whites will be much more interested in issues like health care and pensions. At the same time, the growing minority population - Hispanics, especially - will be concerned about more youthful issues, like schools.</p> </blockquote> <p>The figures, based on new projections from the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html\">US census of 2000</a>, show a quicker growth in minority populations than expected, in part, one demographer <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/2008-08-14-census_N.htm\">tells USA Today</a>, because immigration levels were underestimated.</p> <p>While immigration remains a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7545663.stm\">sometimes incendiary subject</a> in US politics, today's story is treated fairly soberly by most US papers.</p> <p>Could such a thing happen in the UK? It depends who you ask. But it will certainly take a lot longer - as of the 2001 census, the <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=273\">UK remained 92.1% white</a>.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What you've missed</strong></p> <p>Not a lot, in truth - at least on the field of play. There was no sign of Michael Phelps, except in the pancake houses of the Olympic Village, nor a whiff of a British medal. What there was, however, was a joint IOC/Bocog press conference that was feistier than a E102-addled teen. Human rights and press freedoms all came up - as did the question of whether a single Chinese citizen had been granted permission to use the special 'Protest Parks'.</p> <p>Eventually Wang Wei, the general secretary of Bocog, snapped. \"After 30 years of reform China has developed greatly,\" he said. \"People enjoy more freedom. People are living a good life. Everyone is happy. But there are a few people who have come here to peek, to be critical, to dig into the small details and find fault.\" Yep, he was talking about us in the media.</p> <p>Wei's mood wasn't helped by Channel 4's Alex Thomson asking the IOC whether it was \"in any way embarrassed\" by the Chinese government \"lying through its teeth\" about improving human rights. Giselle Davies, the IOC's ice-cool communications director, prevaricated three times before Thomson, who had to resist efforts from two volunteers to force the microphone from him, snapped. \"We're not getting anywhere are we?\" he said. \"Are the IOC embarrassed about the Chinese government's record on human rights? One more chance?\" It wasn't taken.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Sebastian Coe has written off British chances of medals in the athletics, which begins tomorrow, claiming: \"I don't think there will be many here.\" Meanwhile, in the absence of Phelps the spotlight in the pool fell on Kosuke Kitajima, who retained his 200m Olympic breaststroke title. That win, which followed his commanding victory in the 100m earlier this week, has probably confirmed him as the best breaststroker of all time, Adrian Moorhouse permitting, obviously.</p> <p><strong>Latest News </strong><br>Check out the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/medals/full?DCMP=EMC-E_BEI_EMS\">full medal table</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsboxing1?DCMP=EMC-E_BEI_EMS\">Saunders beaten by classy Cuban</a> <br>Billy Joe will be on his travels again after losing 13-6 to Banteaux Suarez, the favourite for the welterweight gold medal.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics5?DCMP=EMC-E_BEI_EMS\">Kitajima seals double breaststroke gold</a><br>Michael Phelps may not have been in the pool this morning, but Japanese hero Kosuke Kitajima was - he retained his 2004 Athens 200m breaststroke title, having earlier this week successfully defended his 2004 100m title.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsgymnastics?DCMP=EMC-E_BEI_EMS\">Yang Wei secures elusive gold in gymnastics</a><br>China's Yang Wei won all-around gold in the men's gymnastics, 18-year-old Brit Daniel Keatings finishing a creditable 20th.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsathletics1?DCMP=EMC-E_BEI_EMS\">Coe lambasts British athletes</a><br>Ahead of a weekend in which Great Britain should win plenty of gold medals in cycling, rowing and sailing, Seb Coe has warned that British athletes are set to flop in the Bird's Nest. </p> <p><strong>Best of the blogs</strong><br> <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/food/2008/08/michael_phelps_really_big_brea.html?DCMP=EMC-E_BEI_EMS\">Fried Egg Sandwiches!

A meal here remains a rare chance to take your eyes and tummy on a time-travel trip, all the while musing that Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Hemingway and Parker once chewed the fat in the private Writer's Room. Raymond Chandler penned The Big Sleep in the back room of the Stanley Rose Book Shop, which was annexed for the grill's 1950s-era \"new room\". In the 1980s, Charles Bukowski spent his royalties here, and his favourite bartender, Ruben, on duty whenever the bar is open, is usually good for a Buk anecdote.

The old Olive Street lobby was famously the second-to-last place Beth \"Black Dahlia\" Short was seen before her January 1947 murder (see Club Galaxy below), but less well-known is the role the lobby played in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Children's_Home_Society\">blackmarket adoption racket</a>, which provided stolen Tennessee tykes to Hollywood stars, who'd pick up their new babes here. If Joan Crawford had been able to see what was coming, she might have thought twice about little Biltmore adoptee (and later author of the poison-pen bestseller Mommie Dearest) Christina Crawford.

From Frank Zappa and the Mothers to the Germs, the late-night bagels, steaming bowls of matzoh ball soup and arch remarks from waitresses have all kept the counterculture humming. These days, you can count on finding legendary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Bingenheimer\">DJ Rodney \"On the Rock\" Bingenheimer</a> dining nightly in the booth with his name on it (courtesy of his pal Nancy Sinatra).

His second venture, <a href=\"http://www.agilitynut.com/clifbrook.html\">Clifton's Brookdale</a> (1935), survives as an astonishing woodland fantasia of faux redwood trunks, babbling brooks, giant moose heads and cherry Jell-o dotted with canned fruit nuggets. Before grabbing a tray and filling it with comfort food, stop by the modest stone chapel on the mezzanine, and listen to a recorded voice musing on the magic to be found in the woods. A young Ray Bradbury (later author of The Martian Chronicles and Farenheit 451) attended science-fiction club meetings under the moose head.

The community of self-professed \"freaks\" that formed around Vito, his fashion designer wife Szou and court jester Carl \"Captain Fuck\" Franzoni, included a who's who of 60s youthquakers: The Byrds got their start in the basement, Love's Bryan MacLean lived upstairs, and the Fonda kids learned how to dance freak-style. Paulekas left town around the time of the Manson killings, but today you can work out above the former site of Szou's dress shop and Vito's basement art studio in Harvey Easton's historic gymnasium, founded in 1938 and long a favourite of Hollywood's athletic set.

  "<p>Russian troops have reportedly begun pulling out of the key town of Gori in Georgia where their presence had threatened the ceasefire over South Ossetia, although Reuters is reporting that Russian tanks have entered the port town of <a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/08/12/GEORGIA_map5.pdf \">Poti </a>(pdf) </p> <p><em>Scroll down and refresh for news, reaction, and your chance to comment and report updates</em></p> <p><strong>10.30am</strong></p> <p>Human Rights Watch provides the first independent confirmation that Georgian villages in South Ossetia have been looted and burned.</p> <blockquote> <p>In South Ossetia, Human Rights Watch researchers travelling on the evening of August 12 on the road from the town of Java to Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic Georgians. According to the few remaining local residents, South Ossetian militias that were moving along the road looted the Georgian villages and set them on fire. Human Rights Watch saw numerous vehicles carrying South Ossetian militia members, as well as Russian military transports moving in the direction of Tskhinvali.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>10.50am</strong></p> <p>Amid much discussion on the energy aspect of this crisis, <a href=\"http://\">Steven Pearlstein weighs in at the Washington Post</a>. He argues that one of the reasons behind Russia's incursion into Georgia is that the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline threatens Moscow's monopoly on energy supplies. </p> <blockquote> <p>...At the least we should be willing to deny Russian companies the right to raise capital on Western stock exchanges, extend their pipelines into Western markets or use their energy profits to buy up major Western companies.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11am</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://english.pravda.ru/world/ussr/14-08-2008/106095-War_South_Ossetia-0\">Russia expert, Marshall Goldman, makes the very same point on the Pravda website</a> - that Russia could not tolerate a pipeline that undermined its control of energy supplies to the west. Western Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its gas supplies.</p> <blockquote> <p>Georgia has built an oil and soon a gas pipeline which will carry oil and gas from Central Asia - this will end Russia's monopoly control over access to energy in Central Asia. This in itself makes Georgia a target for Russia. Russia, as the controller and protector of both Gazprom and Transneft could not tolerate this challenge.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11.20am</strong></p> <p>The consensus among the commentariat is that Russia, particularly Vladimir Putin, has emerged as the clear victor in this short war in the Caucasus. But what about the long term? Robert Hunter, a former US ambassador to Nato, was scathing about Russia's long-term prospects. Speaking on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/video/default.stm\">BBC Newsnight </a>- the video has yet to go up - Hunter dismissed talk of Russia as a resurgent power. It's Saudi Arabia with trees, he said, or words to that effect. He went to argue that in the long run, Russia will suffer as western companies will not be too keen to invest in such a volatile country. While Hunter's view is a useful corrective to the alarmist talk about Russia - and let's face it, it's still pretty enfeebled compared to the US - authoritarian countries do not seem to have much trouble attracting foreign investment. Just look at Russia's neighbour - China. </p> <p><strong>11.30am</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=359&amp;objectid=10526482&amp;pnum=2\">Gwynne Dyer is not getting too worked up about this short war in the Caucasus</a>. He thinks it's much ado about nothing as he makes clear in the New Zealand Herald.</p> <blockquote> <p>There is no great moral issue here. What Georgia tried to do to South Ossetia is precisely what Russia did to Chechnya, but Georgia wasn't strong enough and South Ossetia had a bigger friend. There is no great strategic issue either: apart from a few pipeline routes, the whole Transcaucasus is of little importance to the rest of the world. In six months' time, we probably won't even remember this foolish adventure. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11.40am</strong></p> <p>Reuters is reporting that Russian soldiers have invited Georgian police to tour the strategic town of Gori - also the birthplace of Josef Stalin - abandoned by Georgia's army three days earlier as it retreated in the face of Moscow's advancing forces.</p> <p>\"Driving a black Mercedes car with a Georgian number plate, Russian commanders guided a Georgian police convoy into the centre of the town, which they promised to hand over within days,\" the report says. </p> <p><strong>12pm</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://cominf.org/english/\">South Ossetia's official website</a> is worth looking at, for the blood and thunder rhetoric alone.</p> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong></p> <p>BP says it has resumed pumping gas into the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum pipeline in Georgia, the Associated Press reports. The British oil giant had stopped pumping gas into the pipeline on Tuesday because of security fears, but BP's Baku-Supsa oil pipeline - also shut down on Tuesday - remains closed. The larger Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan line remains out of action after a fire earlier this month on the Turkish section of the line. </p> <p><strong>12:40pm</strong></p> <p>At least five explosions have been heard near Gori, according to AP, suggesting the Russian troop withdrawal may have collapsed. While it was not immediately clear if the blasts were a renewal of fighting between Georgian and Russian forces, they sounded similar to mortar shells and occurred after a tense confrontation between Russian and Georgian troops on the edge of the city.</p> <p><strong>12:55pm </strong></p> <p>The UN estimates that 100,000 Georgians have been uprooted since hostilities broke out, while Russia says some 30,000 residents of South Ossetia fled to the neighbouring province of North Ossetia.</p> <p><strong>1:05pm</strong></p> <p>Rosa Brooks questions in her column in the LA Times just why Georgia was so sure the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/la-oe-brooks14-2008aug14,0,4988958.column\">US would come to its aid</a>...</p> <p><strong>1:15pm</strong></p> <p>Provisions of the agreement reached by Georgia and Russia to end the fighting in Georgia have been released.

Prior to the establishment of international mechanisms, the Russian peacekeeping forces will take additional security measures. </p> <p>-- An international debate on the future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and ways to ensure their lasting security will take place. </p> <p><strong>1:25pm</strong></p> <p>Guardian correspondent Luke Harding, who is on the outskirts of Gori, reports that the Russian's are still occupying strategic points deep inside Georgia.

Tamara Steward writes in the Melbourne Herald Sun about how Georgia is her favourite place on earth - and that the hospitality is legendary.</p> <p><strong>2pm</strong></p> <p>Further to the earlier referenced piece by Rosa Brooks in the LA Times on the role of the US in the current crisis, the Guardian's Seumas Milne writes about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia\">how the conflict is essentially about US expansion rather than Russian aggression.</a></p> <p><strong>2:15pm</strong></p> <p>Supplies have been sent to the conflict zone from the International Red Cross and the UN refugee agency, along with the World Food Programme. Two US aid flights have also arrived in Tbilisi carrying cots, blankets, medicine and surgical supplies.</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia1\">Rachel Clogg has a very thoughtful and well-balanced piece</a> that steers away from the blame game. As she argues on the Guardian's Comment is Free, the problem is bigger than just Russia versus Georgia, it's how the world deals with that old question of self-determination.</p> <blockquote> <p>The lesson of this past week is surely that we ignore so-called dormant conflicts at our peril. This goes to the core of the problem, though - that there is a crisis in international systems for managing conflict, and building peace. The UN is paralysed by the veto powers of its permanent members and the world community does not know how to approach the issue of self-determination.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2.45pm</strong></p> <p>Lativa, Estonia and Lithuania have been among the most ardent supporters of Georgia. <a href=\"http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/21104/\">The three Baltic states are nervous that they may be next</a>, not necessarily now, but 10 years from now, according to the Baltic Times website.</p> <p><strong>3.10pm</strong></p> <p>Anatol Lieven, a highly astute commentator on world affairs, has very little sympathy for Georgia and the Bush administration. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/95713d6c-6966-11dd-91bd-0000779fd18c.html\">He makes the point in a piece for the Financial Times</a> that the US financed and trained the Georgian military even after the Georgian government had said that these forces were intended for the recovery of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The west should demonstrate to Moscow its real will and ability to defend those east European countries that have already been admitted into Nato, and to which it is therefore legally and morally committed - especially the Baltic states. We should say this and mean it. Under no circumstances should we extend such guarantees to more countries that we do not intend to defend. To do so would be irresponsible, unethical and above all contemptible.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong></p> <p>Our thanks yet again to <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/08/13/georgia-russia-whats-next/\">Veronica Khokhlova at Global Voices</a> who provides a translation of <a href=\"http://www.cjes.ru/\">Oleg Panfilov's blog</a> from Tbilisi.</p> <blockquote> <p>If we analyse what's happened, we'll find many arguments both in favor of Georgia, and in favor of the imperial ways of today's Kremlin. One thing is clear, though - Georgia is not going to turn into a different country, it has tasted freedom in the past five years, has tasted democracy, despite the fact that many people do not like it. Now it's up to other remnants of the Soviet empire whether they are going to continue living the way they did or will learn from Georgia.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.40pm</strong></p> <p>The sniping between the Americans and the Russians continues, sometimes taking on a tone of squabbling children in the playground. This complaint is from one Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy head of Russia's general staff, at his daily briefing.</p> <p>\"We have information that American military-transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to Tbilisi airport, though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago. Let's ask them will they invite you (the media) to check whether it is humanitarian or not?... What is in it (the cargo) in reality? ... It is of major concern to Russians.\" </p> <p><strong>4pm</strong></p> <p>The Russia Today website reports that <a href=\"http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/28945\">Russia has held a day of mourning</a> for those killed during the five days of fighting in South Ossetia.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"People from the capital Tskhinvali, which became a battlefield after being attacked by Georgia, are recovering from a nightmare.

  "<p>Kanye West \u2013 rapper, producer, blogger, entrepreneur and \u2026 fattener-up. This last vocation is a new one, coming as Kanye's company, KW Foods LLC, plans 10 fast-food restaurants in the Chicago area. The restaurants aren't Subways, Pret a Manger's, or anything remotely healthy. No, this American chain wears its modus operandi proudly on its sleeve \u2013 it's called Fatburger.</p> <p>According to Chicago Business, Kanye's first Fatburger joint will open next month on Chicago's La Grange Road, with another to follow in January. KW Foods is presently pursuing a lease for a third outlet.</p> <p>The Fatburger chain is known for its dedication to an old-fashioned style, with free jukeboxes in every outlet and an appropriate slogan: \"The Last Great Hamburger Stand\". There are 93 Fatburger restaurants across the United States and Canada.</p> <p>Although big, sloppy hamburgers don't quite mesh with Kanye West's hyper-hip anime/LED design aesthetic, Fatburger has long had a connection with hip-hop \u2013 and besides, Kanye's probably eaten a ton of them while hanging out near their California headquarters. Ice Cube, the Beastie Boys and Notorious BIG are among those who have rapped the praises of the chain \u2013 and rappers E-40 and Queen Latifah both reportedly own franchises, and Pharrell Williams has opened an outlet in China. </p> <p>As we see it, the only trouble for a rapper is how few words rhyme with \"Fatburger\". Then again, it almost rhymes with \"murder\" \u2013 and that's probably enough.</p>",
  "<p>There are certain things that cannot be left to chance \u2013 or to the whims of politicians. Forging a durable and sustainable peace Between Israel and Syria is one of those issues. <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article4449488.ece\">Peace talks</a> with Syria, this time mediated by Turkey, are at the most promising point they've been for the past eight years.</p> <p>Sceptics fear that the political scandal embroiling the current Israeli government and Ehud Olmert's decision to step down as prime minister will set back, or even derail, the current efforts.</p> <p>But that need not be so. The current political chaos hands the Israeli electorate a golden chance to shape the country's destiny. The electorate needs to send a clear message to the candidates at the forthcoming elections that a peace deal with Syria and the necessary compromises this involves is a number one priority. Israelis need to vote against the ultra-hardline, unilateral policies of their government since Ariel Sharon took over in 2000 because they have not brought the security Israelis yearn for and have only ignited even more fear, hatred and distrust. </p> <p>Despite the desire of millions of Israeli citizens to enjoy good neighbourly relations in the region, the country today resembles a massive fortress, as Israel gropes for the false security of higher and higher walls. But even a barrier that reaches to the stratosphere and the \"iron wall\" of a mighty army can never be a substitute for true peace.</p> <p>As Israel celebrates six decades of existence, it has a lot to feel proud about. The country has built up a dynamic and robust democracy and competitive economy, and has a vibrant and diverse culture. But its continued oppression of the Palestinian people and failure to reach a rapprochement with Syria and Lebanon undermine these achievements. Israel, whose people pride themselves on their sense of justice, could edge closer to a fairer reality by mending fences with Syria. </p> <p>With the Palestinian track deadlocked, focusing on the relatively straightforward Syrian front makes sense, and a deal with Syria can, in turn, spark a virtuous circle that can help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As even Henry Kissinger, a good friend of Israel, put it: \"No war is possible without Egypt and no peace is possible without Syria.\"</p> <p>And now is the right moment to take the peaceful road to Damascus. With the Arab world at the readiest it has ever been to reach a compromise, Israel has a historic opportunity to integrate itself gradually into the region but, ironically, it has reacted to the Arabs' more accommodating stance by becoming more confrontational and aggressive. </p> <p>It would be pure folly to squander these opportunities, which are few and far between in this bitter conflict. Although Syria has a reputation in Israel as the most unbending and uncompromising of its adversaries, the conflict on that front could have been resolved half a century ago.</p> <p>Between 1951 and 1953, Adib Shishakli, then leader of Syria, which was smarting from the 1948 defeat, strove to strike a peace deal with Israel in order to focus his energy on internal reform and the country's development. </p> <p>Despite the opposition of leading Israeli military figures \u2013 who in Moshe Dayan's own words were following a strategy of expanding Israel's borders by \"snatching bits of territory\" \u2013 the high-level secret talks reached a promising conclusion in May 1953, but faced too much opposition in the Israeli cabinet.</p> <p>What if Israel and Syria, the country with the greatest ideological opposition to Zionism, had struck a peace deal back in 1953? Could war have been averted in 1967 and 1973? Could a viable Palestinian state have emerged alongside Israel and a compromise over the refugee problem reached? Could Israel have become a full citizen of the Middle East by now? Could the Arab countries have retained their Jewish populations? We will never know.</p> <p>In 1953, one of the main saboteurs of the embryonic peace deal was an obscure water expert by the name of Simha Blass. And the vexed issue of water has been a swirling undercurrent of the Arab-Israeli conflict that has repeatedly smashed the prospects of peace against the rocks.</p> <p>One of the main reasons behind the collapse of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks in 2000 was access to the Sea of Galilee, the inland lake where the river Jordan fetches up and which supplies the bulk of Israel's water. <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0522/p04s04-wome.html\">According</a> to Syria's foreign minister Walid Mualem, Israeli negotiators have agreed to return the Golan Heights down to the eastern coast of the lake, which, if true, removes a major stumbling block.</p> <p>In addition, pragmatism on the part of Israel \u2013 which receives the vast majority of the river Jordan's water resources while Syria and Lebanon only receive 5% of their needs from it \u2013 could ensure that water no longer becomes a cause of volatility. A more equitable division of the area's water resources, which need to be seen as a commonwealth between Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, could pay huge dividends.</p> <p>Rather than facing water shortages, this could actually prove to be a boon for Israel which is a global leader in <a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/israel/rd_expertise_5_en.html\">desalination technology</a> and home to the <a hef=\"http://www.water-technology.net/projects/israel/\">world's largest</a> desalination plant. </p> <p>If the European Union and the USA pledge, as part of a peace settlement, to help further develop and roll out this promising, and increasingly inexpensive, technology to all the countries in the region, water shortages could be averted and an underdeveloped economic sector bolstered.</p> <p>Over the coming months, opponents of peace with Syria will deploy all the tried and tested (not to mention, tired) arguments. They will point to Syria's close ties with Iran and its support of Hizbullah and Hamas as proof of the country's sinister intentions.</p> <p>But there is little reason to doubt the sincerity of the Syrian desire to bury the hatchet and enjoy the dividends of peace. The country is internationally isolated and wishes to come in from the cold. While it will never become a client state, nor should it be expected to, a peace agreement will undoubtedly bring covert, low-level hostilities to an end \u2013 especially if a settlement with the Palestinians follows soon after \u2013 and will empower the moderates to build further bridges towards normalisation.</p> <p>Not so long ago, the Levant was practically borderless and people crisscrossed it freely. Once upon a time, trains ran from Jaffa to Damascus and Beirut. Perhaps soon the political abyss will narrow enough for people to be able to do that again. </p> <p>In my next article for Cif I will argue that Syria should raise the peace ante and offer direct top-level talks with Israel's next prime minister.</p>",
  "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336593877\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2008/08/14/cheesegrater1.jpg\" alt=\"Design for Richard Rogers' cheesegrater skyscraper\" width=\"140\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A 235 metre-high skyscraper dubbed \"the Cheesegrater\" became the latest victim of the economic downturn today, raising new doubts about the future of such landmark projects.</p> <p> The planned 47-storey development in the heart of the City at <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Leadenhall+St,+London,+Greater+London,+EC3,+UK&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=49.357162,114.257812&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.513363,-0.080745&amp;spn=0.009548,0.027895&amp;z=16\">122 Leadenhall Street</a>, between the Gherkin and Lloyds of London, was scheduled for completion by September 2011. But faced with a slowing economy and shrinking demand for office space in London, the developers, British Land, have now pushed completion of the project back until 2012, and possibly even later.</p> <p> Like the Shard at London Bridge, which has suffered its own problems in the credit crisis, the Cheesegrater was set to change London's skyline. It got its nickname from its wedge shape, designed by Lord Rogers to stop it obscuring views of St Paul's Cathedral.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/britishlandcompany\">British Land</a> chief executive Stephen Hester said he was holding off from signing construction contracts because he believed the market for London office space would decline through 2008 and 2009.</p> <p>With prices of steel and energy also just coming down, he will wait until the construction industry is really feeling the pinch and the worst of the downturn is over.</p> <p>\"By waiting until 2011 to start looking for tenants, a year before we finish the project, we will be further into the recovery and should get higher rates,\" he explained.</p> <p>The previous building at 122 Leadenhall Street, a 1960's office block, is being destroyed from the ground up around its central concrete core. For some time it resembled an ice-lolly, but now the floors have all gone and only the \"stick\" remains. </p> <p> Demolition work continued at the site as usual today. A sign pinned to the barriers that prevent office workers and shoppers from toppling into the huge hole left by the excavation promised \"57,000 square metres of the highest quality office space\".</p> <p> Hester would not say exactly how long the Cheesegrater will be left on hold, but it would be at least six months. Analysts, who broadly supported the move, predicted a delay of at least 12 months.</p> <p> Hester admitted that the rules of the construction industry had now changed. \"Today you would never start such a big project without a tenant already lined up. The economics are not attractive enough.\" He also predicted that other construction projects would be delayed by the declining office rental market.</p> <p> \"It's already happening, but in a less public way than with Leadenhall Street,\" he said, speaking after British Land reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a3572m in the three months to June 30 and cut the value of its property portfolio by 5%.</p> <p> The Shard, which at 306 metres will soar even higher than the Cheesegrater, has suffered its own setbacks after the project hit funding problems. Having previously been scheduled for completion in 2011, it will probably not be fully finished until the following year.</p> <p> \"By the first quarter of 2012, we hope it will be done and dusted,\" a spokesman for the Shard project said today.</p> <p> The skyscrapers that are destined to change London's skyline in the next few years were approved when Ken Livingstone was the city's mayor. His successor, Boris Johnson, is much less keen on these multi-storey buildings, and experts believe developers will face a much tougher struggle getting approval for future Shards and Gherkins.</p> <p> The delays to the Cheesegrater may please Prince Charles. In February he warned that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/feb/01/design.architecture\">the current fashion for skyscrapers meant a \"rash of carbuncles\" </a>was sweeping historical cities such as London.</p> <p> But Hester insisted that skyscrapers still had a future despite the economic troubles that are expected to lead to tens of thousands of job cuts across the City, and many more in the wider economy.</p> <p> \"If the economy is to grow then employment needs to grow, so we need to create more space for people to work. If we don't want to build on green fields then we need to get more people into the same space, and that means taller buildings,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The British presence at the archery hangs by the string of a single bow. Alan Wills is the only one left. Naomi Folkard entered the last-16 stages of the women's individual event with a rock-solid year and a commanding few days in Beijing behind her, only to come slightly apart at the seams in the women's individual archery.</p> <p>She was part of a general trend of going out with a bit of a whimper this morning. Perhaps it was the presence of the Koreans, Park Sung-hyun, Joo Hyun-jung and Yun Ok-hee, peppered throughout the last 16, that gave the remainder a feeling of being doomed.</p> <p>Big-name challengers, like Natalia Erdyniyeva (from Ulan-Ude in eastern Siberia, a city with, in its main square, the largest head of Lenin ever made), Khatuna Narimanidze of Georgia and France's B\u00e9rang\u00e8re Schuh, the former indoor world champion, all went out rather tamely.</p> <p>And so did Folkard, who, had she beaten Nami Hayakawa of Japan would have faced Park in the quarter-final. She didn't, a clutch of four 7s and a miserable 5 wrecking her chances. Hayakawa, once of Korea, was granted Japanese citizenship in 2006. Perhaps her roots still pushed out an aura.</p> <p>The routine progression of the Koreans was disturbed by some fireworks. Mariana Avitia, all of 14 years old from Monterrey in Mexico, advanced to the quarter finals with an upset victory over Narminadize.</p> <p>The schoolgirl might have faced fellow Mexican Aida Roman in the last eight, but her team-mate suddenly hit the buffers in the final end against Kwon Un-sil from the People's Republic of Korea. From North or South or re-branded like Hayakawa, the Koreans knocked everyone over.</p> <p>Park caused a stir too in her defeat of Elpida Romantzi of Greece, not because it was close in any way, but because she was at one stage on track to beat the 12-arrow world record of 119 - one shy of a maximum 120. She failed, almost miserably after seven straight 10s by falling into the 9s. She had to settle for 117, a new Olympic record.</p> <p>She took it in her stride, just another number to be acknowledged on her country's journey towards archery perfection.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Charter\">Olympic Charter</a>, much like the <a href=\"http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/preamble-to-the-laws,475,AR.html\">Spirit of Cricket</a>, is one of those documents that seeks to proscribe the philosophy of a sporting contest, but bears increasingly little resemblance to the reality of the event. That does not mean that the charter is worthless. The values it defines are still worthy of aspiring to.</p> <p>Article six reads: \"The Olympics are competitions between athletes in individual or team events, not between countries.\" Of all the sentiments enshrined in the charter, this is by far the most abused.</p> <p>Google \"Beijing Olympics\" and the medal table will appear at the top of your screen. I couldn't care less about the medal table, which is nothing more than a cross-index of a nation's population size and the amount of money and resources it lavishes on sport. The contest between China and the USA is diverting, if only because so many people are so keen to see it as some kind of proxy indication of global standing, but the supposed struggle between Australia and England is little more than headline filler.</p> <p>There are three groups whose interests are served by the constant referrals to the table: whichever nations are sitting first and second; the media, who have a handy league format upon which to build their stories; and the sports administrators, who must justify their expenditure through setting and meeting the arbitrary targets the medal table provides. So Britain want to finish third in 2012. Will anyone care if, instead, they end up fifth?</p> <p>In part, the top nations' obsession with their position in the table can be justified as a means of processing the sheer number of medals they win. But the necessary emphasis on quantity seems to rob the Games of much of what makes them so enjoyable. Britain, like most other countries, has never had to deal with the prospect of winning 20 or more golds, and so it has the luxury of making individual heroes of the winners it does have. Jonathan Edwards became a national icon for winning our sole gold at Atlanta in 1996, and the public became familiar with, and revelled in, his character and story.</p> <p>Better still, what of Togo's first Olympic medal, a bronze in the K1 slalom yesterday? That single podium placement will mean as much to the Togolese as a dozen gold medals to other nations. The man who won it, Benjamin Boukpeti, will be a hero to his people. A bronze medallist from the USA will struggle to get on the evening news round-ups and may simply become another notch in the tally. That may be unavoidable, given the level of the USA's success and the space available to report it, but I still know which side of the equation I prefer.</p> <p>Equally inviolable in terms of the Olympic spirit is the notion that an athlete can win for themselves and choose not to do so for the glory of their nation. When John Carlos and Tommie Smith thrust their back-gloved fists into the night air at the Mexico Olympics in 1968, they were using their personal triumph to express their discontent with their home country. The impossibility of a Chinese athlete making a similar protest to that of Smith and Carlos is one of the few great flaws of these Games.</p> <p>Patriotism is undeniably part of the Olympics, and I'd never want it to be otherwise. But the nation for which the athlete is competing should never overwhelm the individual. There is a point at which sporting nationalism becomes odious, a point never better captured than by John Stockton when he was in Barcelona with the USA's basketball 'dream team'. Asked why the team were staying outside of the athlete's village, Stockton famously replied: \"The Olympic spirit is about beating people, not about living with them.\"</p> <p>The spirit, of course, is about both those things. The majority of United States athletes, indeed all athletes, tend to rebuff the media's invitations to indulge in international slanging matches. Australia's Rob Bell, who won bronze in the C1 slalom behind Britain's David Florence, knocked back a question about what this meant for the rivalry between the two countries by saying simply \"What rivalry?\" Five minutes later, vaguely repelled by the press pack's attempts to stir things up, he whispered to his two fellow medallists, \"Let's get the hell out of here\".</p> <p>Let's leave the medal table to China and the USA, to the sports administrators and target-setters, and to the press. The rest of us \u2013 spectators, fans and athletes \u2013 get along fine without it.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Russell will be here from 1.45am...</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1.56am:</strong> Good morning everyone, and welcome to day six. Five days gone and what have we learned? That a diving pool is a tough place to learn about office politics; that Australian wit is a loosely defined quality when applied by sport officials; and that swimming records now have the lifespan of a mayfly.</p> <p>We return to the pool this morning, when the men's 100m freestyle world record will no doubt be lowered again, having already been broken twice in the semi-finals yesterday. Medals are also up for grabs in the men's 200m breastroke, women's 200m butterfly, women's 200m butterfly, and women's 4x200m freestyle. At the fencing, the women attempt to make a point or two in the sabre quarters and semis, with the finals later this morning. In gymnastics there'll be medals all around in the men's all around. In judo British hopes are with <strong>Peter Cousins</strong> in the men's -100kg, which will move through the preliminaries and repechage to the finals later this morning. Plus we have the women's skeet shooting final, as well as boxing, softball, volleyball and beach volleyball. Let the daze begin ...</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.12am:</strong> Let's run our eye over some British interests for today. As well as <strong>Peter Cousins</strong> in the judo, veteran <strong>Mark Foster</strong> takes one almighty breath and dives into the 50m freestyle heats, while 400m gold medallist <strong>Rebecca Adlington</strong> returns to the Water Cube in the 800m freestyle heats. In badminton, <strong>Nathan Robertson</strong> and <strong>Gail Emms</strong> are in the mixed doubles quarter-finals.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.29am:</strong> Michael Phelps, who by now must surely have a full medal jacket in his wardrobe, isn't exactly prospecting for more gold today but the American is in action this morning in the 200m individual medley semi-finals.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3.01am:</strong> Let's go poolside now, where the men are emerging for the 200m breaststroke final. Japan's Kosuke Kitajima is the defending champion here.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3.09am:</strong> No change at the top there, then. No world record either, but Kitajima defends his title in a time of 2min 7.64sec, holding off Australia's Brenton Rickard, in second, and France's Hugues Dubosq in third. Kitajima add the 200m title to his Beijing 100m gold as he successfully defends the two titles he won in Athens.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> Sensation in the women's 100m freestyle semi-finals, where China's Pang Jiaying is disqualified for starting too early. Great Britain's <strong>Fran Halsall</strong> qualifies fourth fastest for the final. Pang won her semi-final in 53.49sec but was disqualified for flinching at the start.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3.27am:</strong> Britain's <strong>Gregor Tait</strong> now lines up in lane 3 for his 200m backstroke semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.30am:</strong> Tait finishes fourth in his semi, and qualifies sixth fastest for the final in 1.56.72.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.33am:</strong> But where's the green and gold? Paul from Canberra reckons any suggestion that Australian swimming is in decline is rubbish: \"Yes, we're happy to acknowledge GB's improved showing in the pool, just as we're happy to acknowledge the wonderful performances of the Chinese, Koreans and Japanese swimmers and divers who all sit above or equal to the GB swimming team in the medal tally.\" Well, wattle you think of that?</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.51am:</strong> Still, Australia's hopes in the women's 200m butterfly decline as Jessicah Shipper is caught by Liu Zige and Jiao Liuyang in a Chinese one-two in the women's 200m butterfly. Liu takes gold and breaks the world record in 2min 4.08sec.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.51am: </strong>Is it possible to set a blistering pace in a pool? If ever it was going to happen it's now, in the men's 100m freestyle final.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.56am:</strong> No record, but what a finish. <strong>Alain Bernard</strong>'s fingertip wins gold for France in 47.21sec, ahead of Australia's <strong>Eamon Sullivan</strong> - who still holds the world record in 47.05 - and the US's Jason Lezak. Bernard, whose shoulders must have their own postcode, then waves to the crowd who are all hooping and hollering like baseball sluggers at a Madonna concert.</p> <p>Read our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics3\">full report</a> on this morning's exciting races</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>4.15am:</strong> Ho-hum, Michael Phelps wins another race. The American strolls through his 200m individual medley semi-final to win in 1min 57.70sec. Britain's <strong>Liam Tancock</strong> finishes fourth in 1:59.42 and awaits the second semi to see if he makes the final. Phelps' US team-mate Ryan Lochte qualifies fastest in 1:57.69, bumping Medal Man back to second.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>4.21am:</strong> Tancock qualifies seventh fastest for the final, and is joined by fellow Brit <strong>James Goddard</strong>, who finishes third in his semi, and qualifies sixth fastest for the final, in 1:58.63.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>4.46am:</strong> Welcome back, Australia. The Antipodean women smash the world record in the 200m freestyle relay, slicing 5.78sec off the world record to win gold in 7:44.31. It's a third Beijing gold for Stephanie Rice. Silver to China, bronze to the US, with all three teams finishing under the old world mark. The wonders of deep, deep water and a bit of techno kit.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>4.49am:</strong> Meanwhile, things are looking promising gymnastics-wise for Britain's <strong>Daniel Keatings</strong>, currently third in the men's all around final.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>4.50am:</strong> A few results to keep you up to date: in the fencing women's team sabre, Poland beat Canada 45-44 and Russia beat South Africa 45-13.

Russell's toddled off to scrape Olympic images from his retinas, and the cleaners have joined the team in the office.

In the pool they've been going record-crazy, but all eyes have turned to the National Indoor Stadium, where the men's individual all-round event is taking place. <strong>Team GB's Daniel Keatings is currently languishing pretty far down</strong> - but he's only completed three disciplines, while most others are on four.</p> <!-- Block 24 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4m-_2fEp62s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/4m-_2fEp62s&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/4m-_2fEp62s&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>5.35am:</strong> Brazil, as you might expect from a coast-heavy country, are beating the Greeks in the beach volleyball.

Our 'one to watch' for today, Peter Cousins, has been dumped out in the judo. Keatings, meanwhile, is looking pretty good on the floor, as far I can tell (basically he hasn't fallen over yet).</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>5.46am: Team GB gymnastics</strong> Matt 'Here's one I made earlier' Baker is all over the 'nastics, and apparently Keatings has his speciality to come - the pommel, if I heard correctly. Which is a kind of horse.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>5.49am:</strong> It's the USA... no, only kidding, it's China... leading, with Yang Wei apparently some way clear at the top. I know you're waiting to hear of spectacular, high-speed, mid-air balls-ups, though, so don't fear, I've got 'em peeled.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>5.55am:</strong> Emails from John Senior, Mark Webster and Al Parkes, re: Brazil's coastline. Apparently Greece has much more of it. \"If coastlines really were an indicator of beach volleyball prowess then Greece (13,676km) should be comfortably ahead of Brazil (7,491km).\" says Mark. \"Canada (202,080km) would of course be heading for gold, though I guess ambient temperature might be an additional factor.\" I'm not going to argue, but I was thinking Copacabana, sun-tanned Brazilians, and all that entails... rather than the British package holiday-infested Greek sands. Fair dos?</p> <p>Anyway, Brazil won.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>6.01am:</strong> News on the lookey-likey thread from yesterday. I'm not sure how best to illustrate this for people, but my colleague Patrick Whyte has forwarded on a suggestion from Andrew Jolly in Australia: Michael Phelps and Quark the Ferengi from Star Trek. Have they ever been seen in a room together?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>6.04am: Team GB gymnastics</strong> Keating is on the pommel horse, whirling madly...</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>6.05am:</strong> And the Beeb has gone to the news. Fandabydozy.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>6.08am:</strong> Keatings is in 17th after an \"excellent performance on the pommel horse\", according to Rishi Persad, but I can't relay his score. Probably wouldn't have meant much to you or I though, would it? Baker fancies the Russian, Khorokhordin. And I think he's pretty tasty too. But he's not going to win.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>6.14am: Coastline face-off:</strong> Austria (0km of coast) v Mexico (9,330km) up next in the beach volleyball. I know where my money is. And Indonesia, the world champions, are through in the mixed doubles badminton, soundly beating Thailand. <strong>They lie on the other side of the draw to Emms and Robertson</strong>, though.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>6.19am: Ancient Greek history class.</strong> Apparently gymnos is the Greek word for naked - which explains the vacuum-packed leotard arrangements. A gynasium was a place for exercising naked, rather than a place to go and smoke roll-ups behind, as is the modern meaning.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>6.24am: Team GB judo</strong> Michelle Rogers is taking on Jeong Gyeongmi of Korea, and it's 0-0. Apparently she went to the same school as Ryan Giggs.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>6.26am:</strong> Rogers has just conceded a 'koka' (complete guess), the smallest score available to competitors, apparently. GB 0-1 Korea</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>6.29am:</strong> British judo's Beijing suffocation continues, Rogers dumped out by the canny Korean. The smallest margin of defeat is still defeat, lest we forget.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>6.35am:</strong> China may have 19 gold medals (it's looking like that will be 20 shortly, as the men's gymnastics draws to a close) already (and the US topped the table at Athens with only 16 more than that)... but such international point scoring shouldn't be paid heed to, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/why_medal_tables_have_nothing.html\">reckons Andy Bull</a>. And if you'd like a comprehensive rundown of this morning's swimming, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics5\">Robert Kitson has the word</a>.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>6.38am:</strong> Closer to home, the Blackwall tunnel is looking a bit grim. You don't want to get caught in a snarl-up there, I can tell you. Olympic Breakfast with Sue and Hazel coming up...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>6.40am: China's Yang Wei takes gold in the men's all-round gymnastics</strong>, Japan finish with silver, while France nick a bronze.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.46am: Team GB</strong> Weather in Beijing has come over all BST, and as well as providing a convenient cue for Chilesey on the Beeb's couch, it's also contributed to the sailing being delayed this morning. Ben Ainslie and the Yngling girls, both leading their classes, will presumably get their booms back in order later on though.</p> <p><strong>In the boxing, we've got Blisterin' Billy Joe Saunders about to step out in the welterwight category.</strong> He's taking on Carlos Banteaux Suarez of Cuba - and the Cubans know how to produce a boxer, that's for sure: they won five golds in the ring four years ago.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>6.51am:</strong> Saunders bows to the four corners. The British southpaw is in blue, Banteaux red. Saunders is caught taking the fight to his opponent: CBS 4-1 BJS at the end of the first round.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.55am:</strong> The Caravan Kid, as I'm reliably informed Saunders is known, comes out swinging, but he has to beware Banteaux's counter-punching. Beautiful feint and he lands a left flush on the Cuban's chest. BJS pulls it back to 4-5 at the end of the second round.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>6.58am:</strong> Bit of handbags, the Cuban trying to hold Saunders and negate some of his energy. Banteaux is working cleverly on the inside, and despite his efforts BJS is unable to land more than one point in round three. 9-5 to CBS.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>7.02am: Saunders has to get his coat</strong>, after a bit of a schooling. Even when he was showboating, Banteaux landed the cleaner shots. Final second-round score, 13-6. Still, not a bad show from the Caravan Kid, who's only 18 and can look forward to going out in the semis at London 2012. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>7.08am: China have collected their third gold of the day</strong>, although admittedly it was about half an hour ago. Du Li blew away the opposition in the women's 50m rifle. Katerina Emmons of the Czech Republic, the Games' <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/olympics/2008-08/09/content_6920101.htm\">first gold medalist</a> came second, with Eglis Yaima Cruz of Cuba in third.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>7.15am: Team GB</strong> Smiley, smiley Shirley Robertson is broadcasting from Qingdao, where the sailors are concerning themselves with knots of the rope variety as there's no action on the water. Which allows me to segue neatly into Al Parke's zinger: \"I just realised (helped by <a href=\"http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikipedia</a>), that Yngling is not a typo for \"Angling\". Angling did strike me as an odd Olympic sport. However, given that the games include something as bizarre as beach volleyball I thought nothing more of it.\" Al, if angling were an Olympic sport, <a href=\"http://sport.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,10593,-10704317004,00.html\">Bob Nudd</a> would have his tackle out there in a shot - and we'd all be talking about it.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>7.24am:</strong> Canada are currently 1-0 up against the Americans in the women's softball. That'll smart, I imagine, if the Canucks win. Meanwhile, Robin Hazlehurst has written to express his concern about the nature of Du Li's victory: \"Blimey, have they changed the rules, I thought they were supposed to shoot at paper targets, not at each other.\" She metaphorically blew them away, Robin. It was basically a dressed-up lie.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>7.32am:</strong> We're currently in the fallow part of the morning, at least in terms of coverage on the gogglebox. Unless Steve Ovett has <em>actually</em> just won gold in the 800m. Apparently <strong>Team GB's Michelle Rogers, whom I castigated for defeat earlier, has made it into the judo repechage.</strong> So well done her.</p> <p>China are playing Poland over in the badminton mixed doubles. Not a cat-gut string between them currently.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>7.35am: Team GB boxing</strong> Tony Jeffries will go against Colombia's Eleider Alvarez in the light heavyweight class imminently.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>7.37am:</strong> Perfunctory boxing-into-the-camera from Jeffries. He received a bye in the first round, so this will be the first we've seen of him...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7.41am:</strong> Jeffries executes a few punch, miss, cock-your-arm moves. Whether that threw the Colombian, I don't know - but neither manages to score. Appears Jeffries was denied a scoring shot by the judges, though. 0-0</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>7.44am:</strong> Couple of close-range rabbit punches to the head from the Brit, but he's having difficulty scoring even when he manages to pop his opponent cleanly. Hope this isn't going to go the way of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/12/olympicgames.boxing\">Joe Murray</a>. 2-1 to Jeffries</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>7.48am:</strong> Battle proper is almost joined, but the fight continues to simmer. The Colombian keeps bringing down an overhand right which pulls him up score-wise - but the ref has warned Alvarez about ducking down. Solid jab to end the round from Jeffries. 4-3 to Jeffries</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>7.52am:</strong> Another good shot opens up a two point lead for Jeffries, but Alvarez is looking to finish strongly. He bangs Jeffries with an uppercut, and then takes one in the face which isn't scored for the GB boxer. Jeffries evades his opponent until the last 20sec when he pulls level... 5-5</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>7.53am: Tony Jeffries goes through</strong>, winning on the countback. He looked confident, but the fellas on the mics reckon it was mighty close.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>8.01am:</strong> The Chinese pair have beaten their Polish opposition in the badminton mixed doubles, 22-20, 23-21. <strong>Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson are up at around 2.15pm.</strong> And Kyle Hauptman has asked and answered his own question... \"The term 'the Mexican wave' has been on this blog a few times, instead of just 'the wave' as it is called in Canada, the US and some other places. Is there another kind of audience wave?\" Kyle enquired, only to follow up with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_wave#Global_broadcasts\">Wiki's answer</a> a moment later. Apparently it's less Mexican than we've been led to believe...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>8.08am:</strong> Anyway, there's only so much a box of Pro Plus and a plethora of Firefox windows can do for a man... I'm zonked. Howard Swains will be guiding you expertly through the tumult of 8-11 (and maybe a few minutes beyond). I'll leave you with <strong>Tony Jeffries wonderful Mackem brogue.</strong> He's pretty pleased to have beaten Alvarez a few minutes ago to reach the quarter-final. Shame his side will get a pummeling on Saturday when the Prem kicks off.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>8.13am:</strong> Morning all, and welcome to the hidden corner of Beijing known as Farringdon Road. Alan and Russell have successfully beaten off the email botherings of those in the southern hemisphere, which leaves me to deal with those early morning ramblings of anyone hauling themselves into the office in and around the GMT zone. Tell me what happened on the bus this morning by emailing here: <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>.</p> <p>Yesterday, having been thrown unawares into the minute-by-minute mix, each event was greeted on the television as something completely unexpected, and I rather enjoyed it. Today, I at least have some idea of what's coming up: we've got some <strong>baseball</strong>, <strong>softball</strong>, <strong>volleyball</strong>, <strong>handball</strong>, <strong>beach volleyball</strong>, <strong>water polo</strong>ball, <strong>boxing</strong>ball, <strong>judo</strong>ball, highball, lowball, stoolball, whiffleball, wallball and airflowball happening right now. </p> <p>I'd kind of been looking forward to watching Sunderland's Stadium of Light burger van proprietor <strong>Tony Jefferies</strong> taking his place in the Olympic ring, but it seems he's already boxed for the delectation of Alan Gardner, and won. See update at 7.53am. I guess all we can do is speculate on other unlikely professions for British Olympians or, indeed, Olympians from any other countries. I'd like to see a traffic warden in the dressage, or something like that.</p> <p>Still to come: <strong>table tennis</strong>, some <strong>canoe/kayaking</strong> and some <strong>sailing</strong>. Gold medal winners will be decided in the team <strong>dressage</strong>, <strong>judo</strong>, <strong>fencing</strong>, <strong>wrestling</strong> and some <strong>archery</strong>. Not sure if that will be on my watch or not, but you'll surely be here all day, right?</p> <p>In other non-Olympic competition, the battle is on to keep <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/09/london.greyhoundracing\">Walthamstow Greyhound Track open</a>, although I'm indifferent on that one. I spent a night there a year or so ago and got well and truly duffed up by the bookies and their porridge-laden mutts. </p> <p>I also have a telephone date this morning with the incompetents at Iberia airlines, who lost my bag on a flight back from South America on Monday and are yet to locate either it or my flat, I'm not sure which. My phone charger was in that bag, meaning it is now out of juice, as was some expensive(-ish) hair product, which I'm reluctant to replace unless I have to, since I didn't want to buy it in the first place, but have now grown quite reliant on. Oh, there's also a bunch of dirty laundry in there, which they can keep.</p> <p>So, feel free to send in any ideas of how I can get them to do the laundry and deliver the bag; your memories of Walthamstow dog track; suggestions for professions for Olympians; or, if you must, anything about the greatest sporting event in the world.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>8.15am:</strong> Get your ears around this: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/audio/2008/aug/14/mike.adamson.olympics.update\">Mike Adamson reports from Beijing in our daily audio update</a>. Today, Mike talks to Lord Coe, who reckons we should not be expecting too much from our athletes (conveniently), and also attends a tense media briefing with Chinese authorities. There's also a results update, plus a run-down of what to expect for the rest of the day and the weekend.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>8.22am:</strong> The main BBC coverage is showing Olympic Breakfast, with Adrian Chiles and Hazel Irvine interviewing Britain's most decorated <em>Commonwealth Games</em> athlete of all time, Karen Pickering. She keeps all her medals in a plastic bag, apparently, but hopefully not next to a radiator, where they'd likely melt. Meanwhile, Brazil's Washington Silva just won in the <strong>boxing</strong> ring against Samir Bastie, with Ireland's Kenny Egan up next, against the Turkish boxer with a spectacular name: Muzaffer.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>8.26am</strong>: A couple of nice left-hand jabs from Kenny Egan -- the European championship bronze medal winner -- gives him a 2-1 lead at the end of the first round. It's a game of \"physical chess\", we're told.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>8.29am:</strong> The Dubliner Egan takes a 5-1 lead after the Turk walks onto a couple more left-handers. The fighters end up sprawled, greco-wrestling style on the mat at one point, at which the referee laughs. They get up and continue their neat dance. Meanwhile, in the judo hall, Great Britain's Michelle Rogers has lost in the repecharge to a German judo player, which saves us the trouble of figuring out what would have happened if she'd won. A shot at the bronze medal, I think, but am not sure.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>8.33am:</strong> Kenny Egan has got this bout wrapped up now, knockout notwithstanding. The Dublin fighter takes a seven-point lead into the final round after outfoxing his Turkish opponent. One right hook, in particular, is a belter. He leads 9-2.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>8.38am: </strong>\"What's the deal with the Beijinger?\" harrumphs Kevin Mackenzie. \"So far, for me anyway, its made like the British Olympic team on the gold position on the podium, and appeared only the once.\" Not sure about that Kevin, I'll get the techies onto it. Meanwhile, let's spin your disgruntled email into an advert. The Beijinger is guardian.co.uk's daily email update from the Olympics. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/thebeijinger\">You can read previous dispatches, or sign up, by clicking this blue text</a>. As expected, Egan won that bout 10-2 and is now one fight away from a medal for Ireland in the light heavyweight (81kg) division).</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>8.40am:</strong> \"Speaking of the Commonwealth games,\" says Manoj G. Menon, from Mumbai, \"I notice that the top nations in those games are barely registering on the Olympics tally. Canada &amp; South Africa are noticeably absent so far. India is struggling with one gold. Australia and GB are not doing that spectacularly either. Is it because the standard in Commonwealth sport is so abysmally poor?\" At the risk of giving a one-word answer (which would be \"yes\"), it's more the case that the other non-Commonwealth countries are pretty good too, I suppose. The Aussies usually do a bit better in the pool, of course, which could also explain it.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.46am:</strong> A quick update from around the channels: the <strong>canoe/kayak</strong> competition, in which a bunch of speed freaks and/or wannabe astronauts career down white-water rapids in a holed-out lolly stick, has been delayed because of rain. Seems rather like postponing the dressage because of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiWe8c5SbGY\">an infestation of horses</a> to me, but I don't make the rules. Also, the <strong>sailing</strong> has been cancelled today, because there's no wind. Jings. To compensate, \"Olympic Breakfast\" is showing a repeat of some archery, there's also some repeat of some gymnastics on an internet channel.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.51am:</strong> I think they call this a sloooow day, with news that the <strong>rowing</strong> has also now been postponed. That's rowing with oars, not arguing, which would make a fine Olympic sport. Thanks to Kate Bevis for this on the subject of the paid employment of Olympians: \"This morning Japanese TV treated us to a look at the office where yesterday's Japanese gold medalist (Ueno-san in the 70kg women's judo) works. I missed the start so I don't know what type of company it was, but it was very grey. They also showed us her desk which was described as \"very neat\" and sported a calendar with some arrows drawn on (training schedule?). Her co-worker then told us she \"helps to make databases\". She's only there until lunch though - after that she goes to the do-jo. In other exciting Japanese TV news, their 200m butterfly bronze medalist, Matsuda-san, started swimming in a greenhouse made from industrial strength clingfilm. The villagers put it up to cover the outdoor pool so the local children could practice in the winter. Even so the water temperature was only 10 degrees celcius.\"</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.58am</strong>: Italy has won a gold medal, thanks to Chiara Cainero, who is both skeet-shooting champion and a new model of 4WD SUV by the sounds of it. Cainero won a shoot-off against the American and German shooters.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>9.03am</strong>: There's really very little going on at the Games at the moment, so take a look back at what you've missed by clicking on any of the following:<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsathletics1\">Political controversy: Coe dismisses Britain's chances</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsboxing1\">Boxing: Billy Joe Saunders beaten by Cuban</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics5\">Swimming: Kitajima seals double breaststroke gold</a></p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>9.13am: </strong>So, the weather is shocking in Beijing, bad enough to mean all the water-based sports (rowing and kayaking) are cancelled, but it's <em>not</em> bad enough to postpone the archery, in which competitors and thousands of spectators alike have been kitted out with the kind of ponchos given away beside the log flume at Alton Towers. These are presumably not arrow-proof, so let's hope the wind stays down.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9.17am: </strong>This <strong>archery</strong> is riveting. The Korean archer Yun has just hit three nines (the outer gold), while the American Lorig got two eights (the inner red) and one nine. Yun leads after the first end. This is the semi-final, I think, although will confirm that as we go on.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>9.22am</strong> A relatively hopeless seven for Khaluna Lorig is followed by a ruthless ten from the Korean Ok-Hee Yun. Lorig responds with a ten, which puts the pressure back on Yun, and she can only manage an eight. Lorig then gets another eight and Yun a nine, so the Korean is leading 51-55 after six (out of 12) arrows.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>9.24am:</strong> The penultimate three-arrow end also goes to Yun, who pings a 9, a 10 and another 9. Lorig gets 8,8,10 and trails by six points with three arrows left. This one is done, pending disaster.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>9.26am:</strong> No surprises here as the favourite Ok-Hee Yun ousts the American Khaluna Lorig in what was actually the quarter-finals of the archery. In the final end, Lorig shoots 9,9,10, but leaves Yun only needing a five with her last arrow to win. She gets a 10, and takes her pink bow and fisherman's hat into the semi-final. It's hacking with rain, but the quality of the bow and arrow action defies the elements.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> Simon Thomas has an idea on how to boost the British medal haul at the Games (and to diminish the achievements of the half-men/half-fish): \"It seems to me that swimming has far too many medals,\" he says. \"If you check out the list of past winners of the 100m, 200m and 400m at freestyle, medley and butterfly, the same names come up again and again. Solution: get rid of the 200m in all events and the individual butterfly completely. And since we'll all have a bit more time on our hands, stick back in a non-swimming event that we are really good at - the 1km cycling. Then the world (well, my house) will be at peace again.\" It's an idea. Let's give him that.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9.37am:</strong> David Brigden is one of several of you now writing in with other stuff, presumably to save yourself from more arrow-by-arrow archery coverage. And, you know what, he's got an idea as well: \"Today has been a general and memorable discourse about the usefulness of medals table.\" (<a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/why_medal_tables_have_nothing.html\">see Andy Bull's excellent blog on that very subject</a>) \"So in this theme my suggestion (and secret wish) for the whole world to really remember these game in the true Olympic spirit, and not for the number of gold medals, is that instead of the usual \"end of games\" show, all participants including all backroom people, organisers, etc from all of the competing countries gather together in one humongous CONGA and dance around the streets of Beijing.\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.48am:</strong> Back to the archery arena, for my amusement if not necessarily yours. Interestingly, the competitors are summoned to the shooting line by what sounds like a car alarm going off, which also interrupts some dreadful national music, played for the crowd during the breaks. It reminds me of Eastern European turbo-folk, but has a more eastern flavour.<br>Anyway, once the shooting gets underway again, it's the quarter final between the Korean Kwon Un Sil and the 14-year-old Mexican sensation Marianna Avitia. Despite her tender years, Avitia is a dead eye with the bow and a real prospect for the future. In this, she's beaten 105-99 by the Korean, but I saw beware any teenager who can shoot an arrow. She's my early tip for gold in London in 2012.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.51am: </strong>The next quarter final is between Nam Hagakawa, from Japan, and Park Sung-Hyu, of Korea, the defending Olympic champion. The Japanese archer manages a fairly tame three eights; the Korean gets 9-8-9 and leads by two after the first end.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.53am:</strong> Devastating arrows from Park and there's no answer to that. She gets a perfect three tens, which is better than the 8-9-10 of her Japanese opponent. To paraphrase Sid Waddell: \"There's only one word for that - magic archery.\"</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.56am:</strong> Hayakawa is feeling the full force of Park's superlative arrowwomanship here and can only manage 7-8-9 from her three arrows, while Park gets a 9-10-10. \"That's just the way she operates,\" gushes the commentator. Park leads by nine with three arrows left.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> Even though she hits only a seven on her second arrow, Park manages two tens with the others and goes through to the semis 112-103, which is the highest of all four qualifiers. There are two from South Korea, one from North Korea and one from China in the semis. Meanwhile, Neil Stainthorpe, from Austria (who are presumably rubbish at archery), has an idea about the medals table: \"Wouldn't it be an altogether fairer system to organise the medals table by awarding, say, 3 points for a gold, 2 for a silver and 1 for a bronze and then ranking countries according to the total number of points? Why should a country which has won one solitary gold medal and nothing else be placed above a country which has won, for example, 10 silver and 10 bronze medals?\" This has definitely been spoken about before, Neil, but am not sure why it was rejected. Some newspapers do this kind fo thing anyway, which further undermines the authority of an \"official\" table. How about alphabetical order, huh? The Austrians would be still be pipped by Australia, though.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>10.04am:</strong> William Fotheringham <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/five_factors_that_will_determi.html\">has been blogging about Great Britain's hopes in the velodrome</a>, and it's well worth a read - if you can tear yourself away from this archery. Richard Alderson has e-mailed on an almost similar subject: \"Remove Phelps from the equation and the Americans are having a shocker in this Olympics so far,\" Alderson says. \"Once all the boats and cycles come home over the weekend, it's not inconceivable that we might catch them.\" The problem is, we <em>can't</em> remove Phelps from the equation, because he's American and has now won 613 gold medals. It's like saying remove Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United, and Chelsea would have won the league.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>10.10am:</strong> Matt Warner is in Belgium, but that doesn't appear to be his fault: \"I recently moved to the chips and, it would appear, rain capital of Europe - Brussels,\" he laments. \"At my work people are carrying on as if the Olympics isn't happening with nary a mention in the first week. Is this because the Belgians are poop at everything - or are they going to come into their own in the next few weeks?\" I don't really know about the Belgians, but your office doesn't sound too dissimilar to this one, to be honest. Despite our committed band of sport beavers, life continues largely untroubled by the Olympics at Guardian Towers. There's more talk about A Levels today than anything Olympic, even though that very same dead horse is flogged annually, rather than every four years, like this one.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10.20am:</strong> Everyone's got an idea of how to make archery more exciting (which gratifies me in some way, even though it implicitly implies that my coverage is boring). John Senior reckons they should host it at the Lakeside or Circus Tavern: \"Archery would be so much more exciting if they had beer-bellied Cockneys shouting out the score like in darts. The Korean's perfect score would have caused much more excitement accompanied by a long drawn-out \"THIRRRR-TEEEEEEYY!\"\", while Gordon PITTENDRIGH (who writes his surname in capitals, as though shouting it at someone who continually mispronounces or misspells it), suggests going feral: \"The archery would be monumentally more interesting and exciting if all the competitors were deposited in a forest and the last three standing could then have a shoot off against each others for the medals. Remember the Olympic motto - highest, fastest, strongest and bloodiest.\"</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>10.29am:</strong> Just in case you're baffled by all this, here's what's going on in the Olympics at the moment: hardly anything. The lightning, rain and (lack of) wind has put paid to the rowing, kayaking and sailing, while the only real action is the semi-finals of the women's archery and some basketball between Lithuania and Russia. Lithuania are three points up in the second period there. Charmian Owens, meanwhile, is disappointed by Seb Coe's view on the British track and field chances, which you can hear <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsathletics1\">in Mike Adamson's interview with Lord Seb</a>. \"Fair enough it is a concern that we are not medalling as we have done in the past at major championships, but we need to nurture the talent and develop our athletes' mental strength, which were I believe we lack,\" Charmian says. \"What will a statement coming from one of our Senior Olympic Official, do for team morale?\" Hear, hear. In brief: although Coe probably has a point, he probably shouldn't have said it.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10.35am:</strong> Apart from the men's <strong>basketball</strong>, the Olympics this morning are all about heavily armed women. The <strong>skeet-shooters</strong> are now back at their shooting stations, where the commentary includes such gems as \"she unloads that spent cartridge and puts in another one\", while the dead-eye <strong>archers</strong> are doing their thing in the Beijing rain. It's the semi-finals there and I'll do some more arrow-by-arrow of the final, if no-one sees the sense to wrestle this keyboard out of my reach before then.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10.43am:</strong> OK, we're down to the finals in the archery and there's a vaguely interesting political showdown for the bronze medal, where the North Korean Un Sil Kwon is up against the South Korean Ok Hee Yun. Presumably, Seoul and Pyongyang have ground to a halt. Can the spirit of competition for third place in an Olympic competition heal the divide. We'll see. They were 55 apiece after the first six.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>10.46am: </strong>In your face, Pyongyang! The South Korean Ok Hee-Yun proves that political liberation rather than nuclear oppression is the only real gateway to Olympic bronze, when she defeats Un Sil Kwon, from the North. The gold medal match to follow. David Lloyd (not that one, or that other one) is zinging this morning: \"With all this Asian domination of the archery one wonders why Kevin Costner never bothered entering for the USA.\" I get where this one is going. \"I remember seeing him in a film once about some blokes rushing around a forest with barely a gadget between them and he seemed to manage landing one pointed stick on top of another quite regularly. He even managed a few trick shots, eyes closed on horseback, from a flaming tree hut etc which if included would liven proceedings up considerably don't you think?\" Yes. Yes I do.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>10.50am:</strong> OK, China versus South Korea in this gold medal match, with Park Sung-Hyun representing the visitors and the vaguely Spanish-sounding Juan Juan Zhang up for the hosts. The Chinese nails a 10 on her first arrow, but lets her country, a billion viewers and herself down with a 7 on the next. Meanwhile, Park hits a 9 to start with, but goes into the lead with back-to-back 10s. Game on.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>10.53am:</strong> Still a two-point gap at the end of the second end, after Zhang gets three nines, and Park gets 8-8-10.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>10.57am:</strong> Great arrows from Zhang, who sends the home crowd delirious with a 10-9-10 to edge into the lead. Park only manages a 26 to the Chinese's 29.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>11am:</strong> Amazing stuff here in the <strong>archery</strong> arena, where Zhang Juan Juan needs to score a nine with her final arrow to win the event and break one of the longest-standing strangleholds in any Olympic competition. The Koreans have never lost in this, but they have now! because Park picks out the gold in the centre of the target and wins herself a shiny gold medal, 110-109. The South Koreans get silver and bronze, but China take their 21st gold of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>11.04am:</strong> Scott Murray has just shuffled into sight, and he'll be taking over here once he can find a chair, desk, television and computer. Such luxuries are by no means guaranteed when you sign up for a shift here. I'm not sure what he's going to write about to be honest: all we've got left is live basketball, a thriller between Lithuania and Russia (the Lithuanians lead 69-60 in the third quarter). Kevin McKenzie asks: \"For those of us reading your commentary on the fly at work and unable to watch on TV elsewhere, can you please explain what skeet shooting is?\" At the risk of providing another one word answer (which would be \"No\"), I'll try to describe what flashed up on the screen a few minutes ago, but which has since been replaced by judo repeats. It was kind of like clay-pigeon shooting in a rain and wind-swept heath somewhere, the likes of which I didn't know Beijing possessed. The shooters had some kind of shotgun thingy and were dressed in cagoules. Anyway, it's gone now, so let's pretend it never happened.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>11.16am:</strong> It's a rainy day, and we're cashing in all the pennies saved up for Scott Murray, who is now in the house. He'll be taking you through to the end of this basketball match between Russia and Lithuania, and will also have the pleasure of Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms in the badminton, coming up soon. Thanks for your emails, and keep them coming for Scott. He's going to need them.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>11.25am: <em>[MBM reporter sits down and begins to wing it, Barry Davies style]</em></strong> Morning everyone, to the Basketballing Jam Called Thursdays. Lithuania are five points ahead of Russia with two minutes to go. So are we all on the edge of our sea... ah. Minute-by-minute basketball, that it's come to this.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>11.29am:</strong> It's 84-79 to Lithuania with 31 seconds remaining. Am I actually writing this?</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>11.29am and 20 seconds:</strong> There are 11 seconds remaining, a man has blown a whistle, and now Lithuania take a free pop at goal, or whatever. They're now 86-79 ahead, a timeout has been called by the Russians, and my admiration for the improvisational skills of Barry Davies over the years has just multiplied by 374,958.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>11.32am:</strong> Peep peep peeeeeeep. That's it, Russia can't score at a rate of nearly a point a second to win - there's a surprise - and the Lithuanians prevail 86-79. They were \"consistent throughout the entire game in its entirety\", according to the commentator, which suggests basketball analysts are not much further advanced than their footballing counterparts. Lithuania top the group, while Russia, who have now lost three games, look a wee bit jiggered.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.35am:</strong> Hazel Irvine on the BBC has just had a wee bit of fun with Thai boxer Non Boonjumnong's monicker. Apparently it's a bit of a tongue-twister! Really, are we not over this style of light banter in 2008?</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.46am:</strong> The laugh really is on Boonjumnong now, though. One of the favourites for gold in the welterweight Belting Seven Bells Out Of Folk sport - he won silver at the world championships last year - Boonjumnong's just been slapped all round the ring by Egypt's Hosam Abdin in the round of 16. According to the points system, if I understand it correctly, which I don't, the Egyptian hit his opponent 11 times on the head, while only being smacked in the mouth ten times himself. That's quite an upset.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.51am:</strong> Meanwhile, check out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/feedarticle/7724295\">this toaster</a>! Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian has thrown the mother, father and extended family of all hissy fits after only winning bronze in the 84kg greco-roman boo hoo hoo. It's all to do with \"politics\", according to Abrahamian, who flung his medal away with all the style of a toddler dropping his ice-cream on the pavement. It's not exactly Tommie Smith and John Carlos circa 1968, now is it.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>O yay, O yay, 12 o'clock and all's well!</strong> Well, all's sort of OK, passable, but let's not split hairs on another lovely day of sport. A lovely day which can only be further embellished by clicking on <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/bumbling_bowlers_scoffing_swim.html\">this link</a>, which will in turn lead you to further YouTube links of Michael Phelps cramming junk food into his gaping maw, some classic Olympic action from 1908 (yes), and <em>that</em> interview with hitherto unrecognised comedy genius Schteve McClaren of Holland. Oh, and the big badminton match is on in 15 minutes, so please hang around. <em>Please.</em></p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> Mark Foster, flag-carrying Mark Foster, the man who embodies Britain - old, knackered and way past its best - has been knocked out of the 50m freestyle heats. Aw. <strong>China Weather News, presented by saucy weathergirl Richard Greaves:</strong> \"Just got back from my 80-minute cab ride there-and-back trip to the Kayaking where I sat in the rain for two hours only to be told the race would be postponed. Can anyone explain how wet it has to be to be too wet for kayaking?\" Wet it has to be to be too wet for kayaking? That sounds like a Bruce Forsyth catchphrase in the making.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>Smith &amp; Carlos It Ain't dept.</strong> \"Thanks for that link to the hissy fit,\" writes Steve Johnson, who I have to say seems very polite and well brought up. \"I have sympathy with the Swede though. I read the article only to find that 'Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian threw down his 84kg greco-roman bronze medal in protest'. I know these fellas should be pretty strong, but that's a bloody big medal to be lugging about.\" Ladies and gentlemen, remember the name, I'm sure you'll be hearing a lot more of him, put your hands together for Steve Johnson!</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>12.16pm:</strong> Don't worry, you're missing no Emms-Robertson action. They're waiting for some other match to finish before they can start. Which gives us time to consider that great big gurning greco-roman galoot again, in <strong>Smith &amp; Carlos It Ain't dept. pt. II:</strong> \"So, the Swedish wrestler is lamenting that 'it's all politics',\" writes Gary Naylor, cueing himself up for the punchline. \"At the Olympic Games? Who'd have thunk it?\"</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>12.20pm:</strong> Here's some risk-taking journalism for you: I'm off to suck down a cheroot, all the while hoping the Emms-Robertson stramash doesn't kick off before I get back. It's all OK, though: Tom Bryant is on hand to hold the fort should my little scheme somehow go cups up.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>12.26pm:</strong> As Scott poisons himself downstairs it appears his luck is out as Emms and Robertson are on the court and biffing the shuttle delicately back and forth between them and their opponents. They then manage to lose the serve at their first attempt. Good stuff.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>12.29pm:</strong> The Brits win a fantastic rally to take the scores to 2-2, prompting a clenched fist from Emms and some, \"I'm the man, me\"-style posturing from Robertson.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Ah that's better. Thanks Tom. And thank you to Camel cigarettes. The Koreans are 5-3 up now, the 19-year-old Lee delivering a couple of tasty smashes in a row.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>12.33pm:</strong> Emms looks much the sharper of the British duo at the moment. Robertson slaps a hopeless smash into the net to fall behind 6-4, but Emms wallops two forehands past the Koreans to level the scores at 6-6.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>As Bruce Forsyth would say: How wet does it have to be to be too wet for kayaking, to be too wet for kayaking how wet does it have to be?</strong> \"I would think it more likely to be postponed due to possibility of lightning striking carbon fibre paddles,\" writes Claire Wright. \"I'd rather pull out than take a possible fry-up penalty! I think the fry-ups are better left to Mr Phelps.\"</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> The Koreans have romped into a 10-7 lead, but a Robertson smash from the back court sets up Emms to put the return away. And then Robertson flicks one to the far corner to make it 10-9. Great! Ah, hold on, now it's 11-9, and time for a breather. Puff puff drink drinkity drink puff towel towel puff.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> Just a fantastic rally from Robertson, who smashes then dinks, dinks then smashes, and finally smashes the cock straight into the chest of Lee YD. He then runs around fistpumping like a lunatic. Is there really any need? When he put away the final point in the last round to put the Chinese number-two seeds out, he started running around in circles, much like Ray Wilkins did when he scored for Manchester United in the 1983 FA Cup final against Brighton. He barely gave poor Emms a cursory hug. There are two of you competing here, Robertson. As a team, yes?</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.45pm:</strong> Emms and Robertson are 18-14 down. This set - is it called a set? - looks over for the British pair.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> Hold on, it's a game, not a set. Emms and MeMeMe are four game points down, 20-16. But they save the first two. It's 20-18 and hot, hot, hot.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.50pm:</strong> At 20-19, Mr Me sees his serve sail straight back past his lugs, and that's the first game to the Korean pair. \"Prior to the Emms-Robertson match was a thrilling Korea v China men's singles, which may yet have a bearing on the current mixed doubles game,\" reports Ben Roome, doing my job for me. He goes on to relate what appears to be an old episode of Jeux Sans Fronti\u00e8res: \"It was full of controversy, mascots falling over and being unable to get up, and the Korean Lee Hyunil to come from behind in the first game despite a terrible umpiring reversal that can only be put down to local pressure to quieten the partisan crowd and crush his opponent in the second. Hyunil demonstrated genuine mental and physical class in his win and as a result you could see the whole Korean badminton camp was lifted by his heroics. Having seen their boy win, I think the Koreans will feed off that and beat the UK pair too.\"</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> Emms and Robertson have already let an early 2-0 lead slip in the second; they've got no answer to the much more mobile Koreans and are 5-2 down in the blink of an eye. British sport at its best!</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.54pm:</strong> Mr I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I. Robertson delivers a decent smash to win a point, flexes his muscles Andy Murray style for the cameras for 17 minutes, then hoicks his very next shot straight into the net. Great. Britain. \"Has 'Team GB' won anything today?\" asks Oliver Pattenden, who knows the answer to his own question, I've never been more sure of anything.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.56pm:</strong> A couple of decent points from the Brits. Emms leaves a cheeky dink from Lee HJ, and it's a good call because the cock sails just outside the line. They draw level 8-8 - and then go ahead in a game for the first time in the match! 9-8. I should be cynical about British chances more often. Actually no, I probably shouldn't.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.58pm:</strong> Robertson attempts a dink over the net. The shuttle hits the cord and tips over, winning the point. Robertson struts around the court with his arms stretched out wide like Jesus. A Jesus who has just found the cure for cancer, fixed the hole in the ozone layer, and devised a macro-economic policy to eradicate the credit crunch. And yes, of course his very next smash pings into the net like a wet flannel. He's actually becoming increasingly entertaining, I'll give him that.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>1.02pm:</strong> The Koreans lead 13-11, Robertson finally finding his range and smashing down a beaut which the Koreans leave only for the perfect shot to find the back line. But Korea hit back immediately, then Emms hits two poor shots in a row - the first a simple smash into the net, the second a wayward swipe long and wide - and the Brits are 16-11 down and heading out.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>1.05pm:</strong> The Koreans are far too good. It's 18-11 and basically over. \"I do find the whole Team GB thing quite dispiriting,\" writes Chris Hatton. \"I enjoyed Euro 2008 much more because England didn't qualify - can we go for the same approach to London 2012 so we can actually enjoy sporting<br>excellence rather than being hammered relentlessly with the news that a<br>Team GB boxer has made it into the last 16?\" Sounds good to me. Chris Hatton is a Professor of Psychology, Health &amp; Social Care, by the way, so he knows what he's talking about. The mental equilibrium of the nation depends on our ability to heed what he's saying.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Reacting to a shuttle toppling off the net cord, Lee Yongdee clips an exquisite and frankly outrageous return to set up nine match points. The first is saved, but there's to be no berserk comeback, as the very next point sees the Korean pair clinch victory, two games to nil. Instructively, Robertson does not run off the court in a huge semi-circle whooping and hollering.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> \"In small parts we were great,\" says Robertson in the post-match interview. No you weren't.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.11pm:</strong> The BBC interview goon insensitively asks Emms if she is definitely going to retire. She starts to cry. The interview goon makes no attempt to fill in the dead air time, but in fairness does stops just short of repeatedly poking Emms in the shoulder and chanting the word \"LOSER\". He switches to Robertson, who makes a bid for Kenneth Tynan/Sex Pistols foul-mouthed legend, but his \"we just wanted to bloody win it\" sounds too much like Alan Partridge bemoaning \"Sunday, bloody Sunday\" to be thoroughly convincing.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.16pm:</strong> It's the 800m women's freestyle, featuring Becky Adlington in heat 4, and this is not a live transmission I'll be bound. Let's see what happens here, then.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.18pm:</strong> I wonder if Adlington, who is <em>miles</em> ahead in this heat, will break the Olympic record?</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> Yep. 8:18.06 is the fastest time in the world this year, the second fastest time in history, and an Olympic record. Gotta love Britain, right here! Emms and who in the what?</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.23pm:</strong> \"I didn't expect that, I'm really pleased about that,\" smiles Adlington, barely out of breath as she comes out of the pool. No swearing, you'll note. And therefore no opprobrium.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>Groundless Optimism with guardian.co.uk and Andrew Moore:</strong> \"The Olympics always get going slowly for Britain, because our stronger events are always in the second half of the games. If the London organisers have any say over which order the events are scheduled surely we should schedule our strongest event early so that we can get off to a flier and get people excited. It would be a disaster if the nation is sitting around in 4 years time, waiting for the swimming and greco-wrestling to finish before it can start flag-waving.\" You do realise the second half of the Games is basically the athletics, Peter? I'm only trying to manage expectations here.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.40pm:</strong> There's a bit of a lull now, which opens a lovely cigarette window for your honest hack. Just in case anything happens in the next few minutes, while I slope off to wheech down a fag, Tom Bryant is keeping an eye out. I'll be back very soon, probably to find Tom reporting on the biggest Olympic story to break since Ben Johnson was busted in 1988.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.44pm:</strong> <strong>BREAKING NEWS - massive drugs bust at Olym ...</strong> just kidding. In real news, British swimmer Gemma Spofforth has come in sixth in her 200m backstroke heat in 2:10.58, which probably won't be good enough for her to progress. \"That could have gone better,\" she says, unsurprisingly, before admitting that she was over-excited.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.48pm:</strong> \"This, for me, is probably the weaker of the 200m backstroke heats,\" says the man from the BBC as the swimmers sets off at a blistering world record pace, eventually finishing with Kirsty Coventry claiming an Olympic record of 2:06.76. That, right there, is incisive commentary.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.52pm:</strong> In the next heat, our very own Elizabeth Simmonds goes out as if she's got an outboard hidden under her cossie - the sort of pace at which you'd expect her to run out of steam, mid-length, and drown. Fortunately that doesn't happen and she touches home in first with a new British record of 2:08.66 and in second place for the semi-final. Spofforth has also crept in. Woo! for the Brits.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>1.55pm:</strong> And woo! for Tom Bryant. Thanks for that. And woo! for the Olympics, for suddenly nothing whatsoever is happening. Everyone's kicking back a while.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2pm:</strong> Hold on! Roger Federer is a set down to James Blake in the tennis. And it's 5-4 in the second set; Federer will be serving to keep his chance of gold alive.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>GOOD SUBSTANCE ABUSE JOKE:</strong> \"Glad to hear that for Becky Adlington, there was, as you say, 'no opprobrium',\" writes Al Parkes. \"The taking of any performance enhancing drugs is something we should all<br>condemn.\" Federer double faults to give Blake a window of opportunity; it's 15-30 in a game the Swiss has to win.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.04pm:</strong> Federer was 30-30 and on his second serve, but a brilliant serve-and-volley wins the point; one more and that's 5-5 in the second set of this quarter final.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.08pm:</strong> A scream of anguish from Federer at 30-30 as he overhits a forehand when it was certain he'd earn himself a break point. Blake serves out to go 6-5 up. Once again Federer must serve to stay in the tournament.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.13pm:</strong> Two careless forehands from Blake at 0-15 and 15-30. Then Federer nearly smashes a sitter of a volley into the net, but lucks out as the ball pings off the cord and topples over into Blake's court. Federer goes on to hold his serve - without once getting a first serve in. It's going to a tiebreak.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.13pm:</strong> Blake is up in the tie-break, 4-1. Over at the light welterweight boxing, Britain's Bradley Saunders, to give him his full name, has been beaten 11 smacks upside the head to 7 punches in the mouth by Alexis Vastine of France.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.17pm:</strong> Federer is hanging by a thread. He's 5-2 down in the tie-break, and Blake has two serves to come.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.18pm:</strong> Blake pushes Federer to the back of the court with a series of ferocious forehands to give himself four match points. He only needs one: Blake is through to the semi-finals at the expense of the big man.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>2.20pm:</strong> It's the hockey! And Barry Davies! And where were the Germans? And frankly, who cares? Anyway, it's New Zealand v \"Great\" Britain in the women's tournament, and it's live, live, live. Both teams really need to win if they want any realistic hope of making the semi finals, so here goes.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> Britain haven't shown much up front so far, until Danson goes, er, dancing through the Kiwi defence and would have got a strike on goal were it not for a team-mate getting in the road. That's a long corner, a set piece which, rather like the corner in British association football, is routinely wasted. Does anyone ever score from them?</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> They score from penalty corners, though. Gemma Flynn of New Zealand gets on the end of a routine and clips the ball into the goal from a sharp angle on the right. That's 1-0 to the Kiwis. This is a pretty appalling day for Britain, isn't it. But let's face it, roaring success would just make us feel uneasy. This is what we know, it feels safe like this.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>2.32pm:</strong> Here's a thing, though, this Danson looks some player. Whenever she gets the ball she invariably beats two or three opponents with a mazy dribble.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>2.33pm:</strong> And it's 1-1! Richardson and Wright combine well down the right, the latter crossing for Craddock who flicks on to Danson to guide a high ball home. That, ladies and gentlemen, is hockey.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> Craddock twists and turns down the left and wins a penalty corner after... er... yes. The hooter goes, but there's still time to take the set piece - and Panter whacks it home for Britain! Unfortunately, she is judged to have swept the ball into the goal, which is apparently not cricket in hockey, so it's disallowed and the score remains 1-1 at half-time. Although the official Olympic on-screen graphic insists it is 2-1 to Britain. It is 1-1 though. Er. Barry Davies is frothing indignantly at the decision, his funk mothership sailing right into the hot, hot heat of the sun.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>2.53pm:</strong> And we're off again, after ten minutes of Equestrian Dressage which caused minor blood clots in both of your MBM reporter's eyes. And with half an hour to go, Britain win a penalty corner after a Kiwi attempts to juggle the ball out of the area with their knee, Ronaldinho style. Not that it matters, the subsequent set-piece being eventually hoofed away by the keeper. This is just turning into a kickabout.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>2.57pm:</strong> This is all Britain, is this. Craddock flicks the ball up on the left and hits a reverse pass into the area which Danson nearly guides home with the back of her stick. I have no idea whatsoever if any of that was legal but it sure looked skilful.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> Cullen has just wheeched a penalty corner into the net for Britain with just under 20 minutes left on the clock. They're 2-1 up; to be honest I didn't see much difference with her strike and the disallowed one by Panter on the stroke (literally) of half time. Still, all good and well. \"Is this reality or are you trapped in some kind of OBOer's nightmare, where random sports hove into view then disappear again for no reason?\" asks Chris Hatton, who you may or may not recall is a Professor of Psychology, Health &amp; Social Care. \"The mention of Barry Davies was the clincher for me - surely he went over the Reichenbach Falls in a final struggle with John Motson some time ago?\" Oh it's reality alright, but by no means a nightmare. This hockey is fantastic, for example, and Nathan Robertson's preposterous antics were a strange joy to behold. Although during the Dressage the words \"class\" and \"war\" did keep scrolling across my line of sight, much like the end credits of Crossroads. Does that count as a nightmare, Professor Hatton?</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>3.07pm:</strong> Fifteen minutes to go. Team GB are still 2-1 up. Can we please hold onto <em>something</em> today?</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>3.08pm:</strong> Unlike Gerard Depardieu, Forgesson of New Zealand is given a green card.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Cullen handles in the area, I think. Whatever she's done, she ain't done no good, for the New Zealand team are awarded a penalty corner. It's cleared, though the Kiwis are turning the screw. \"Worrying moments for Great Britain,\" says Barry Davies. Those five words may as well be recorded by the BBC and played on 24-hour loop for the entire duration of the athletics.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>3.16pm:</strong> Britain knock it around the back for a while. Barry Davies has got the regal funk on because Britain's play is \"difficult to describe as progressive\". There's little better on national television than Barry Davies in a self-righteous stew.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>3.19pm:</strong> With four minutes to go, Britain are awarded a penalty corner. It's wasted. But they pin New Zealand back in their own half for a couple of minutes. The clock is ticking.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>3.23pm:</strong> And that's it! Britain beat New Zealand 2-1, mainly down to Storry in the goal, who flung herself spectacularly at a penalty corner, a save I might not actually have described at the time. That keeps alive their outside chances of a place in the last four. So there's something to cheer about at the end of a dismal day at the Olympics for Team GB. Still, let's not be miserable about it, what did you expect? We're only Britain, after all.</p>"
