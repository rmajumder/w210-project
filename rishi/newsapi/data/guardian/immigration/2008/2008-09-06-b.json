  "<p>On contemplating the literary career of AN Wilson, the only proper reaction is awe at his extraordinary productivity. By my count, he has published almost 40 books - although there have been so many it's hard to keep track - and he can hardly be accused of ducking the big questions, since they include biographies of Milton, Tolstoy, Jesus and St Paul as well as novels of sufficient quality that the last was Booker-longlisted. </p> <p>Six years ago, he moved into the field of history with a long, rich and evocative portrait of the Victorian age; three years ago, he published a sequel, rather unimaginatively titled After the Victorians, which was even more opinionated, a fair bit sloppier and no less entertaining. Now we have his take on the last half-century, a book with all the weaknesses of swift writing and superficial research, but, almost infuriatingly, all the strengths of Wilson's wit and literary insight.</p> <p>While Our Times is structured along fairly predictable lines, interweaving chapters of political narrative with sections on such subjects as the rise of permissiveness and the decline of Christian worship, that is the only predictable thing about it. </p> <p>In fact, there is plenty to make more sober historians blench. It is hard, for example, to imagine many academics repeating the funny (if well-worn) story about Diana Dors, n\u00e9e Fluck, being introduced at a church fete by a Swindon vicar as 'Diana Clunt', and then giving the reference as Wikipedia. Most historians wouldn't ignore economic matters almost altogether, as Wilson does, nor would they agree with his claims that Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin wanted to dismantle the empire. </p> <p>And, as was the case with After the Victorians, some of Wilson's factual errors almost defy belief. Getting the dates of the Glorious Revolution (too late) and the Siege of Derry (too early) is one thing, but when Edward Heath goes to the country in February 1972, two years too early, you almost wonder if Wilson is doing it deliberately.</p> <p>As a work of serious history, in other words, this book is an abject failure. As a very funny, extremely opinionated, always provocative and often thoughtful read, however, it is a terrific success, a verdict that will no doubt disappoint many historians who do know their dates but have none of Wilson's fizz. True, he can be very glib, arguing, for instance, that the Cold War was a clash of 'uncertainties' rather than certainties, which only goes to show that he has been reading too much John le Carr\u00e9 and not enough (indeed, not any) documents from Washington and Moscow. </p> <p>And yet he is capable of serious and incisive judgments, especially when discussing the struggle between religion and secularism, something of an obsession here but a powerful theme often neglected. </p> <p>The erosion of the old 'tribal magic', as he calls it, is one of the keys to the book. In Wilson's eyes, the decline of religious belief is one of the central elements in the erosion of social order. Its absence explains the enduring appeal of such writers as JRR Tolkien, a man he hugely admires, and whose influence on the global imagination, he points out, has been greater than that of any other post-war British writer.</p> <p>Above all, Wilson is endlessly entertaining. He compares Benjamin Britten not with Tippett or Vaughan Williams but with, of all people, Sid James, while later he develops an elaborate comparison between Tony Blair and TV presenter Philip Schofield. His treatment of the monarchy is a strange and always funny mixture of deference and contempt. The Queen, although 'shy and stilted', emerges well. Prince Charles wins praise for his environmental and architectural enthusiasms and Diana is described as 'truly great'. By contrast, Prince Philip comes across as mildly ridiculous. 'I'm nothing but an amoeba!' he yells when told that the Queen will not take his surname. Yet he gets off lightly compared with Lord Mountbatten, in Wilson's view a 'mass murderer' for his 'gross mismanagement in India', and later an 'elderly popinjay, with his arrogant manners and his fondness for naval ratings'.</p> <p>Wilson's character sketches are often masterpieces of injustice. He considers the Beatles pretentious and, bizarrely, describes the Rolling Stones as 'in every way more talented', even describing Mick Jagger as one of the world's great ironists. But his real targets are politicians of all stripes, who usually come off badly. Enoch Powell emerges as a bristling madman, with his Birmingham accent constantly maligned. Harold Wilson, rumoured to have got one of the best firsts in Oxford's history, is 'half-educated'. Ted Heath's hapless Chancellor Anthony Barber 'seemed like a man playing the vicar in a suburban amateur dramatic society'. John Hume, a secular saint in some quarters, was 'weasly'. Jim Callaghan was simply a 'bonehead'. </p> <p>Yet other characters comes in for peculiarly lavish praise. He admires John Major for his 'unflappability' and 'understatedness', while David Owen is lauded for his 'powerful charisma' and 'high intelligence' and would have been 'one of the truly great Prime Ministers'.</p> <p>The politician who gets the biggest beating is Roy Jenkins, or 'Woy', as Wilson calls him throughout. Since Jenkins is usually the hero of books like this, there is something unexpectedly and perversely refreshing about finding him traduced. When Woy first surfaces, Wilson draws attention to his 'Balliol bumptiousness' and 'claret-marinaded dinner-party manners' and mocks the 'pomposity of his aristocratic, high-table verbal mannerisms ... the ever-stirring right hand, sometimes to emphasise a debating point, sometimes to feel along a hostess's thigh'. But he is only warming up, for when Woy reappears as a founder of the SDP, he is 'puffed-up, pompous and vacuous'. He was, Wilson tells us, 'an incompetent Home Secretary and a disastrous Chancellor', his achievements dwarfed by those of Margaret Thatcher, a 'person of high intelligence'.</p> <p>This might suggest that Wilson is an unalloyed admirer of Thatcher and Thatcherism, but that is not really true. He clearly approved of her guts and vision, but at the same time he bemoans the consequences of her uncompromising revolution, from the communities destroyed by unemployment to the traditional folkways concreted over in the name of the market.</p> <p>Beneath all the jokes and the sneers, he has a serious point to make. Britain, he laments, has 'stopped being British', a process he blames partly on immigration (wrongly, in my view), but also on globalisation, market economics and the uncritical worship of novelty. There is no need to share his more reactionary prejudices to concede that he has a point, just as there is no need to share his hatred of poor Woy Jenkins to enjoy this infuriating, passionate, hilarious and sometimes plain barmy book.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dominic Sandbrook's most recent book is White Heat: A History of Britain in the Swinging Sixties (Abacus)</p>",
  "<p><strong>Glasvegas</strong> <br>Fat Sams, Dundee</p> <p>In a hot, dark basement in east Scotland's biggest city, crowds are getting ready for the big new band from the west. The atmosphere is buzzing, as it should be. After all, Glasgow's Glasvegas are being proclaimed in many quarters as one of this decade's most exciting new groups and their hotly awaited debut album is released tomorrow.</p> <p>It all started when music mogul Alan McGee found them playing third on the bill at Glasgow's King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in 2006, just as he had with Oasis in 1993. The band added to their image themselves, channelling the romance of rock'n'roll in their style and their sounds. Even before tonight's gig starts, for example, the stage bristles with the spirit of 1958 rather than 2008.</p> <p>Brylcreem-haired roadies gently try out the sound levels and soft, skittish doo-wop purrs from the speakers. To this observer, the effect is magical.</p> <p>But not all the crowd are happy. Take the angry young man next to me, decked out for the night like a cut-price Liam Gallagher, who starts swearing and booing as the doo-wop loops on. But then, something happens. The lights dim, a warm bath of sound starts to swirl around the room and for the next 45 minutes he doesn't utter a word.</p> <p>Glasvegas's performance tonight is so full of power and punch that I bet it would shut up even the most petulant critic. Their music sounds wonderful, mixing Phil Spector's girl-group pop, the Velvet Underground's thumping rhythms and the Jesus and Mary Chain's clamour. Despite the boomy acoustics, it also manages to sound tender, creating space for James Allan's thickly accented vocals and the lyrics that make his band stand apart. Take 'Flowers and Football Tops', the opening track of their album and the song that kicks off tonight's gig. It serves as a great lyrical primer for the Glasvegas virgin, telling the story of a son who never comes home. 'Baby, baby, baby, why you?' sings frontman Allan, his voice soaring gorgeously as the rest of the band strike their strings and their skins. 'My baby is six feet under/ Just another number/ my daughter without her brother.' </p> <p>Singing from the perspective of the boy's mother, it's one of several examples of Allan singing in female character. Not only does this undercut rock's stodgy machismo, it also links Glasvegas with 60s girl group the Shangri-Las, and their pop songs about premature deaths. This connection with the hampered innocence of the past gives Glasvegas even more magic, and when Allan finishes his song by singing eight bars of 'You Are my Sunshine', the effect is poignantly perfect.</p> <p>Some could claim that the act of making shamelessly sensitive music isn't exactly revolutionary when Coldplay are still shifting the stuff by the truckload. But by filling their songs with rich, vivid details as well as huge, heavenly sentiments, Glasvegas are doing something different. In 'Sad Light', for instance, Allan sings about a man looking at Alpha Centauri and grappling with heartbreak, while in 'Ice Cream Van', he talks about a child waiting for one to come. In lesser hands, these lyrics may have sounded silly; tonight, they sound extraordinary.</p> <p>The fans think so too. They go crazy to the band's recent single, 'Geraldine', a song full of hopeful lyrics about being someone's shepherd and angel, which has a neat twist - these words come from a social worker. They revel in this detail, singing: 'I'm your social worker!' with the same passion as I heard teenagers sing: 'You and I are gonna live forever' in 1994. But unlike Oasis and other stadium-saturating bands, Glasvegas have a very human relationship with their audience. Rather than strutting around arrogantly, they thank their fans, the venue, and their support band, and smile. And while they might arrive on stage all in black like a classic rockabilly quartet, you're not surprised when Allan starts the show wearing shades but dispenses with them quickly.</p> <p>I hope Glasvegas don't try to seek out any similar accoutrements of fame. On this evidence, they don't need to; every song tonight already sounds like an anthem. It helps that most of them begin with pulsing guitar drones and that Caroline McKay's drumming is as thunderingly primal as the White Stripes' Meg White's playing. But their simple, bright melodies are important too, uniting the crowd like perfect football chants do. </p> <p>In the closing song, 'Daddy's Gone', this is particularly clear. At one point, the guitars and bass drop out, revealing the bare bones of Allan's vocals and McKay's fierce snare. The audience responds by nearly drowning them out, the most noise coming from teenage boys, most of them sitting on each other's shoulders. Given that this song is about an absent father, and that brotherly togetherness is normally out of bounds for macho music-lovers, this is a wonderful thing to hear and see. It not only represents a step on the way to rewriting rock's blokey rulebook, but it also shows how heart is much more important to the power of music than muscle.</p>",
  "<p>There are many who do not like Rachida Dati. The left detests her as an acolyte of Nicolas Sarkozy, France's maverick right-wing President. The employees of France's Ministry of Justice make little secret of their profound distaste for their boss's methods, views and taste for foreign travel and photoshoots in luxury hotels. A number of high-level civil servants have resigned from Dati's private office muttering about vicious personal verbal abuse, tantrums and incompetence. The fact that Dati is a Muslim of immigrant origin is enough for the extreme right; that she grew up on a tough housing estate on the outskirts of the central French city of Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne suffices for the haut bourgeois elite who still dominate vast tracts of France's economic, political and social life. </p> <p>Yet last week, Dati found herself universally popular. As so often in France, it was not the act itself that was important so much as the manner in which it was executed. Other women have become pregnant while in office - at least one while unmarried - but the paternity of the child has been at the very least identifiable. This time, not only is the father unknown, but 42-year-old Dati, who has never married and says that the birth of the infant will be the 'best day of her life', has hinted heavily that he could be one of a number of people. She is not going to say which one, however, restricting herself so far to the bald statement: 'My private life is complicated.'</p> <p>And this is the key. Because Dati has given the French what they enjoy most: an opportunity to mark the difference between them and the prudish, prurient, sexually neurotic, puritanical Anglo-Saxons, many of whom live nearby.</p> <p>So in editorial meetings across the nation, the decision has been taken to respect the French journalistic adage that 'news stops at the bedroom door'. Though rumours have been rife since Dati returned from her holiday at a luxury hotel in Morocco - ministers at the first cabinet meeting of the new political year apparently politely congratulated their colleague without actually making a direct reference to the increasingly evident bulge beneath her perfectly tailored Dior suit - no mainstream publication ran with the story until it was officially confirmed by the minister herself at a briefing of half-a-dozen female senior correspondents at the Ministry of Justice in the Place Vend\u00f4me early last week. </p> <p>There, a reportedly 'happy and calm' Dati, after a discussion about her reform plans for the French justice system, 'could not stop herself telling a small group of select correspondents the happy news'. To say the story was front page news would be an exaggeration, but it received widespread coverage in the French press, though without a single mention that the father of the child remained anonymous. Only the Anglo-Saxon press did that.</p> <p>Yet the distance with the sensationalist Britons and the family-value-obsessed Americans may be narrower than some in France like to think. The mainstream press may have behaved rather differently from their cross-Channel or transatlantic colleagues might have done, but the mass readership gossip magazines and the blogosphere have shown more interest in exactly who may be the father of the child of the 'newly happy diva de la Place Vend\u00f4me'.</p> <p>Dati has certainly known tough times. Her father was a devout and conservative Algerian-born mason, one of the hundreds of thousands of immigrant workers brought over to help with postwar reconstruction who stayed on. Her mother was an illiterate Moroccan farm girl. She grew up at Number 13, Rue Henri Dunant in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne on a grey, low-rise council estate in the shadow of a huge agricultural silo and processing plant. Dati's extraordinary drive to escape from the grey blocks, the vandalised playgrounds and the discount stores was obvious early on. Money earned as a check-out girl, in door-to-door make-up sales or as a home help for the elderly was reinvested in her economics degree.</p> <p>Just months after her graduation, she hustled her way to a meeting with the then Minister of Justice and into a job as an accountant. Seven years later, on the advice of another highly placed mentor, Simone Weil, the former minister and Holocaust survivor, she switched to law, working during the day and studying at night for her qualifications. A swift rise up the judges' ranks, more chutzpah and the same driving, steely ambition brought her to the notice of Sarkozy. 'You may not like Rachida but you can't help admiring her,' said one former associate. In France, where people still talk of coming from a 'good family', Dati is the political equivalent of an extraterrestrial.</p> <p>And her success, along with her abrasive style, has made her enemies. That she is good looking and likes expensive clothes has not helped. In the past 15 months, the attacks have come from every direction. Her ministry is one of the most high profile and a series of controversial reforms that the President, whom she continues to address with the formal 'vous' despite their close collaboration, asked her to push through has stirred up a hornet's nest of angry judges, rivals and unions.</p> <p>The trial of a brother for heroin trafficking was an excuse for more attacks. The slightest gaffe is the pretext for editorials questioning her competence. Yet Dati is still there. The reforms have been largely pushed through. </p> <p>Dati angrily says that her life 'is not a novel' - yet there are a dozen biographies already in print and rumours of films. 'The more people search to romanticise my life, the more they look to deny me legitimacy. I've worked hard, that's all,' she told one interviewer last year. 'And even people who don't like me can't take that away from me.'</p> <p>Even admirers find her hard work. Henri Guiano, the President's closest counsellor, has said she thinks everyone is looking down on her. 'It is like she has been skinned alive,' he told a reporter. When a fellow minister offered his support during the trial of her brother, calling her 'my little Rachida', she exploded. 'You would not say that to Christine Lagardere [the Finance Minister] or Mich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie [Minister of the Interior],' she told him. 'I don't need you or your support.' </p> <p>When another major conservative politician and rival tried to build bridges by inviting her to lunch after denigrating her publicly, she was unavailable on the date suggested 'and for ever'. To the most wounding verbal assaults, she simply says grimly: 'I have heard worse.'</p> <p>But her loyalty to Sarkozy is unshakable and has so far been rewarded not merely by the protection of the head of state but by invitations to travel with him - even on the family holiday last year that saw the Sarkozys controversially visit the American first couple on their ranch. Dati has said of rivals in the French cabinet that they serve their careers, she serves one man. </p> <p>When it came to choosing between her close friend Cecilia, the second wife of the President whom he divorced shortly after entering the Elys\u00e9e, and Sarkozy (and her political career), there was no hesitation. On her desk currently at the ministry are four pictures of her with Sarkozy and one of her with Carla Bruni, his new wife. </p> <p>Dati has said that she will stay in her post as long as possible - 'Pregnancy is not an illness,' she barked at one reporter - but is already hinting that the next step might be an assault on the Paris town hall. For the moment, whatever the mainstream newspapers say or do, the question that everyone wants answered is simple: 'Who's the daddy?'</p> <p>The frankly improbable outsiders include Sarkozy himself - there was a period of some months when Cecilia had left and before Carla had arrived during which Dati travelled frequently with the President - and Jos\u00e9 Maria Aznar, the former Spanish Prime Minister and friend of Sarkozy. The latter even took the extraordinary step of denying - suspiciously rapidly, some say - that he was Dati's lover after being named by a Moroccan news website last week. </p> <p>Closer to home, Dati has been linked to two French businessmen in recent weeks. Both are described locally as 'richissime', which needs no translation. Gossip magazines have taken to frantically calculating with whom Dati was rumoured to have been on holiday at potential moments of conception. Another name in circulation is a popular television host and producer known simply as Arthur.</p> <p>Between the French viewpoint and that of the 'Anglo-Saxons' there is a middle way. The French minister, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said, was an example for single mothers everywhere. 'Her silence [on the identity of the father] contains a profoundly political message,' the newspaper told its readers. 'The woman who faces motherhood alone is no longer a sad and shameful loser but a proud woman with nothing to hide from anyone.'</p> <p>As Dati might say, there are worse things that can be said of someone.</p> <h2>The Dati lowdown</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>27 November 1965, the second of 12 children of a Moroccan mason father and an Algerian mother. Worked as a medical assistant in a private care home at 16 after leaving school, continuing her studies in the evenings and gaining degrees in both economics and law.</p> <p><strong>Best of times</strong> Having written to the then Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy in 2002 stating her desire to advise him on immigration, she became a constant and loyal figure, taking the role of spokesperson during his fight for the presidency. Her loyalty was rewarded in June 2007 when her appointment as Justice Minister made her the first person of North African descent to hold a top government post in France.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times</strong> Her mother, whom Rachida described as 'the light of my life', died at an early age, forcing her to look after her younger siblings. She has since said: 'When I lost her, I thought I had been punished.'</p> <p><strong>What she says</strong> Rejecting the notion that she is a role model: 'My life is not a beautiful story. I am not the heroine of an instructive novel to present to the people so they can shed a tear or to encourage them to work hard.'</p> <p><strong>What others say</strong> 'You'd love to have occupied it, wouldn't you?' <strong>Carla Bruni</strong> to Dati, pointing to Nicolas Sarkozy's double bed in the Elys\u00e9e Palace. Sarkozy has referred to Dati as 'ma beurette', meaning 'my little Arab girl'.</p>",
  "<p>The two men shambling towards me could almost melt into the bustling crowds filling the streets of Istanbul's Taksim Square. Only the AC/DC badge worn by one and the other's long hair mark them out as different from the tourists and locals seeking shade from the fierce midday sun. I am at the Bar Code bar nursing a Diet Coke, watching customers playing backgammon and checkers as they drink Turkish coffee and suck on hookahs. The two men are Marwan Ryad and Faisal Talal, the drummer and lead singer of Iraqi heavy metal band Acrassicauda. The band have been around for eight years, but it was only with the recent release of a feature documentary Heavy Metal in Baghdad that they have come to international attention. The film has been visiting film festivals across the world, but the band members have been forced to remain in Istanbul, where they have the status of asylum seekers, unable to work or travel. Anyone who wants to talk to the band must visit them in Istanbul. </p> <p>They take their seats and a bartender brings Marwan a beer and Faisal a coffee. They both light cigarettes. I ask Marwan to tell me about his childhood. 'When I was growing up in Baghdad, my father used to listen to Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra,' he says. 'I grew up on that music, grew up watching Elvis in Fun in Acapulco and I remember watching Buddy Rich on the drums and thinking that's what I want to be, a drummer.' </p> <p>But why heavy metal? 'I was an angry person,' Marwan continued, 'and I found that when I listened to metal rather than getting angry at myself I could channel it; rather than beating people up, I could beat on the drums.' Inspired by bands like Biohazard and Anthrax, Marwan decided to set up a band with his friends Waleed and Faisal. They named themselves Acrassicauda after the Latin for 'black scorpion', rehearsing in a Baghdad basement and playing concerts that attracted hundreds of other metal fans. 'The first concert we played was in 2000,' Faisal told me, 'and it was in this small club, maybe 250 capacity, and it was full - we were surprised that so many people were craving this music.' </p> <p>It surprised me as well. I had always considered heavy metal to be the preserve of privileged Western white boys wailing and complaining about how they had nothing to scream and complain about. Growing up as a teenager in Iraq, yearning to express oneself amid a climate of repression, it is perhaps not so surprising to see the appeal of metal music. As one of the band members says in the documentary: 'We are living in a metal world.' </p> <p>After Waleed left Iraq for Canada, the band's line-up was Faisal as lead singer and guitarist, Marwan on drums, Tony Aziz on lead guitar and Firas al-Lateef on bass. Marwan was the band's songwriter. 'I wrote my songs in a small room with a generator spewing out gas,' he told me. 'That was our reality and in my songs I absorbed that and tried to translate it into music.' The song titles - 'Massacre', 'Message From Baghdad', 'Between the Ashes', 'The Underworld' - give a hint of their tone, which Marwan describes as 'wrathful, realistic, dramatic, angry music'. </p> <p>The music reflected their daily lives; Marwan told me that he experienced more than 10 explosions. After one, a makeshift morgue was constructed on the street where he lived. 'I saw a bomb explode just 20 metres away,' recalls Faisal. 'It killed everyone around me.' </p> <p>There were also risks in playing what was considered to be Western music. 'The music we were playing was a taboo,' explained Marwan. 'We were playing with fire. The traditional conservative culture was afraid of what they didn't know.' The heavy metal ritual of head-banging was condemned as it was claimed that it mocked religious prayer. The band received death threats amid accusations that they were too Americanised. 'We were afraid to say anything that may hurt your future or family,' says Faisal, and though the band claimed to be apolitical they were ordered to include pro-Saddam songs in their set list, the price of being allowed to perform at all. </p> <p>In Heavy Metal in Baghdad, there is footage of the band singing 'The Youth of Iraq' which includes the lyrics: 'So we decide to fight the evil forces, yeah... we're never gonna lose/ Following our leader, Saddam Hussein/ We'll make them fall, we will drive them insane.' In the documentary, Firas quotes the Arabic saying: 'To stay away from the devil, sing for him.'</p> <p>Despite suspicions aroused by the music Acrassicauda remained able to still perform under Saddam's regime but following the American occupation, life became even more dangerous. 'It was easier for us before the invasion,' says Marwan. 'Back then, we had concerts that really kicked ass, with 600 people at our gigs.' 'After the invasion, it was just too dangerous to play,' continues Faisal. 'Before the invasion, life was clear - you had limits and rules - but afterwards it was just chaos and that is frightening.'</p> <p>Tony left Iraq at end of 2005 and Marwan and Faisal fled to Syria where they spent a year before they were ordered to leave. 'We didn't want to return to Iraq,' says Marwan. 'It was just total chaos, so we decided to try to get to Turkey.' The only way Turkey would accept them was as tourists, which meant a one-month visa, but even that required each band member to have $2,000 on arrival. </p> <p> By then, the band had come to the attention of two film-makers, Eddy Moretti and Suroosh Alvi who, inspired by a 2004 profile of the band in Vice magazine, had resolved to bring the story of Iraq's only metal band to the world. While Marwan sold his drum kit and the others sold everything else, they had the film-makers set up a website to solicit donations to help the band reach Turkey. Within three days, the website had raised $17,000, enabling them to leave Syria for Turkey, where they have been for the past year. Tony and Firas stay outside Istanbul and Marwan and Faisal share an apartment in a rough neighbourhood where the floor is rotting and the ceiling is leaking. 'I saw a black scorpion in my room the other day,' says Marwan, 'and we had a rat living with us for a while.' The apartment is above a kindergarten so Marwan cannot even play on a practice kit because the teachers complain about the noise. </p> <p>I ask them how they spend their time. They laugh and pretend to consult their diaries. 'We are not allowed to travel, we are not allowed to work and we cannot speak Turkish,' says Faisal. 'We have no money so we hang out with friends and walk around the city.' They follow the progress of the documentary online, sitting in their apartments looking at photos taken of screenings at the Berlin and Toronto film festivals. What irks them most is that they haven't been able to play their music. 'For us, that was how we beat our frustrations and fears,' Marwan tells me. 'It was how we defined who we were. Without the music, I am nothing, except another Iraqi refugee.' </p> <p>Having spent the past year in legal limbo, the band have been granted the right to residency in the United States and they will be moving in the next few months. I asked how they felt about living in America where their beloved metal music is even more popular. They seem nonchalant but I wonder if they are just playing it cool. So, I suggest, as the bartender brings the bill, soon you will have your chance to chase the fantasy of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. 'Dude, this isn't about sex, drugs and rock'n'roll,' says Faisal. 'It was always more serious than that. For us, this is about reality. The music we make is not performance, we are not wearing masks, it is about who we are.' </p> <p>I shake their hands and just as I am about to say goodbye, Marwan turns to me and says: 'Remember, we are not children of rock'n'roll, we are children of war.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Heavy Metal in Baghdad is released on Friday, September 12.</p>",
  "<p>It's being described as a third agricultural revolution. A new generation of people living - as much as they can - off the land: swapping their inner-city gardens for hardscrabble smallholdings, the daily commute for early-morning goat milking, their domestic cats for pedigree pigs, their Blackberries for home-made compost. It's not easy, and it's not always pretty - don't imagine that this is about flowery Cath Kidston wellington boots. Most of the so-called 'greenshifters' are more bothered about potato blight and blow fly than owning the idyllic country cottage with clematis over the door. But there does seem to be something stirring in the cynical soul of the British urbanite. A shift in ambition, away from consumerism and city life, even as the credit crunch takes hold. So much so, according to the most recent State of the Countryside report, that for the first time in generations more people are moving to rural areas than are moving out of them - and crucially the newcomers are families with young children.</p> <p>The best indication that something is changing is the fact that rural land is holding its value, and this despite the slump in the property market elsewhere. Figures from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggest that in some areas the price of an acre has increased by 50 per cent. Many smallholders head towards Wales, Scotland and the east coast where it's still possible to find something affordable, but in places such as Devon, Britain's most expensive county, agents are charging as much as \u00a38,000 an acre. There is, perhaps, a bitter-sweet irony to the fact that strapped-for-cash farmers have realised they can make money by selling off relatively modest areas - a small-holding can be anything up to 40 acres - to people chasing the rural dream. According to rural estate agents, four out of five small farms these days are sold to newcomers. </p> <p>Robert Jeffery and David Morris used to be dairy farmers until they realised they had something more marketable than milk - their experience. They set up NewLandOwner (<a href=\"http://www.newlandowner.co.uk\">www.newlandowner.co.uk</a>), a Derbyshire-based company which runs courses on how to start a smallholding. Jeffery advises on everything from how to handle goats to how to get planning permission, to all kinds of people, from wannabe Alpaca farmers to millionaires who fancy having a go at growing their own vegetables. 'Most don't especially need to make a profit,' he says. 'They just want the business to wash its face. It's as easy to make a living on a 20-acre farm as it is on a 200-acre farm. But for the first two years it is all about investment and no income.'</p> <p>The courses have proved so popular, Jeffery now calls himself a 'twilight farmer' in that the only chance he has to work on his own farm is at the end of the day. 'I think people are motivated by the falseness of life in the city,' he says. 'They want to get back to basics.' </p> <p>While this is not the first time that young people have wanted to get back to the land, this current generation has advantages over their forbears from the Sixties and Seventies many of whom embarked on a new kind of life only to find it impossible to survive. First - no one thinks you're mad to try it any longer. The popularity of allotments and chicken-keeping (said to be the nation's fastest-growing hobby) means something that was once seen as hippy and alternative is swiftly becoming more mainstream. At the same time it's become much more accessible: there are countless smallholder books and websites; even the right equipment is more easily purchased than it used to be.</p> <p> Pat Gardiner, used to work in the port industry until he decided to fend for himself back in the Seventies. He started a self-sufficiency website (<a href=\"http://www.goselfsufficient.co.uk\">www.goselfsufficient.co.uk</a>) in his spare time. He thinks people feel out of control of their lives now, in the same way as he did in the Seventies. 'Recession, price inflation, uncertainty. The instinct to batten down the hatches and look after yourself, leave the world outside, is deeply ingrained,' he says. 'You may think it's a dream but you can actually do it.'</p> <h2>The new recruits</h2> <p><strong>Two ex-RAF trade Iraq for goats and an ice-cream parlour in Wales</strong></p> <p>Tony Knight calls them 'my ladies' and can identify every one of his goats. Each has their own personality, he tells me. There's Wolfie, the herd matriarch. Apricot who can best be described as a bolshy teenager. There are the skittish escape artists, who if there's a hole in the fencing will find it; the body surfers who have a habit of launching themselves, Pete-Doherty style, over the rest of the herd. Most memorably there's the one who might have died if Jo, Tony's wife, hadn't nursed her back to health. In their bedroom. </p> <p>When Tony came home he told her off (that's Jo, not the goat). </p> <p>The experts advise first-time smallholders to start with something easy, like chickens. Fifty- five British Toggenburg goats in a barn in the garden is a bit like having 55 teething babies in the spare room. They may be cute - a lovely mushroom grey colour, with white Gandalf beardy bits - but they also have a unique talent for disrupting a night's sleep or refusing to feed. With their high-pitched bleat, they even sound like squalling infants.</p> <p>Still, owning a herd of goats beats flying Hercules airplanes in Afghanistan and Iraq, says Tony with a grin. His old job was in the RAF. 'I've been mortared a few times, been shot at a few times as well. Somewhere out there you know there is a bullet with your name on it and every time a gun goes off, it gets one closer to you.' Different shift patterns meant that Jo, who also worked for the RAF, on the logistics side, never saw her husband. 'And it was only a matter of time before she'd be called up, too. As the Forces shrink in size, you're more likely to go. At least I was flying - on the ground it would have been even more dangerous.'</p> <p>So in 2004, after 16 years in the RAF, the couple decided to try their hand at something else. There was a long, frustrating search for the right place until they found Little Ffarm Dairy - 38 acres nestled in an idyllic spot in the countryside of Carmarthenshire. ('Turn left at the beech tree,' run the directions for my mini-cab driver.) They have a vegetable patch, an orchard, plus plenty of room for chickens, geese and ducks, some sheep and ponies. The notion of keeping goats came to Jo when they visited a small goat dairy in Aberystwyth. 'I've always fancied doing something like that,' she said to her husband. Tony replied: 'Well, why don't we? If we don't do it now, we never will.'</p> <p>This may sound impetuous, but they actually come across as an eminently sensible pair. The sale of their house in the Cotswolds, plus pensions from the RAF, helped to pay for the \u00a3350,000 farm (though they still have a mortgage). They've completed a couple of livestock courses and a career in the Forces means they know all about long hours and how to cope in a crisis. 'The training in the Air Force means we know what's needed to be done and we do it literally to perfection because that's the way we've been trained,' says Tony. </p> <p>This hasn't stopped the goats giving them the runaround on occasion. They put up video cameras in the barn, but the goats, like contestants on Big Brother, somehow learnt how to dodge them. Now they've hitched up baby monitors which means they can jump into their wellies if there's a problem in the middle of the night.</p> <p>Then there was the breach birth on their wedding anniversary that saw Tony in the barn with the distressed goat, and Jo on a phone with a poor signal trying to speak to the woman who sold them the goats in the first place to get instructions on what to do. 'Put your hand in and flick the legs forward!' she told him.</p> <p>Not long afterwards, when Tony was away, Jo wondered if she'd made the biggest mistake of her life. 'I'd had 16 years of complete routine and suddenly I was on my own, having to cope. The kids refused to feed. It seemed as though they'd rather starve than take the milk. It was half-past midnight and I was trying to get milk down their throats. I remember thinking: Bloody hell, what have I done? Talk about hell in paradise.'</p> <p>But gradually their new life is coming together. Tony has almost completed a new milking parlour, the shell made from an old Kingsmill bread lorry. Any day soon they'll be going into production with three flavours of Lovespoon, their luxury goats' milk ice cream, which Jo makes to her own recipes and without any artificial flavouring having completed a gelato course in Bologna. They've finally been given official environmental health approval. (The paperwork in farming is worse than the RAF. 'Which is saying something,' says Jo.) </p> <p>Hopefully, if the ice cream takes off, they'll finally turn a profit. For the moment, Tony has decided to take a commercial airline job to get some money in, one month on, one month off. The irony is that the neighbouring farmers envy Tony for the fact he flies airplanes whereas all he'd rather do is stay within sight of the cottage and chat to his ladies. 'We're not goat-obsessed,' insists Jo. 'I am,' says Tony.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lovespoongelato.co.uk\">www.lovespoongelato.co.uk</a></p> <h2>The novice smallholders</h2> <p><strong>The close-knit family keeping their late grandfather's dream alive</strong></p> <p>Chris Blevin, 39, is trying to plumb in two outside toilet cubicles for 200 guests ahead of their hog roast at the weekend. His mother-in-law Liz is fresh from making the latest batch of jams and chutneys which they sell to local farmer's markets and shops. Chris's wife Hannah, 34, is marshalling two of their three sons, Peter, 8, and Joel, 6, who are dressed up as a policeman and a pirate, respectively, while giving me a guided tour of their animals. She points out their pigs, Middle Whites and Large Blacks, and her favourite Muscovy ducks, as well as the vegetable beds and the fledgling orchard planted with 30 different types of tree. This is Peter's Eden Farm, three generations, living in two adjoining houses in the countryside near Boston and working on 13 acres of land. </p> <p>If it sounds idyllic, it is - and it isn't. It depends on which day you catch them. When the sun's shining and the hay's safely in, when Liz is up to speed on the latest order for jam and their sausages sell out in 28 hours - it couldn't be better. When Chris wakes and can hear the rain thrumming on the window panes for the third day in a row and Hannah has accidentally rolled the trailer into a dyke, then they wonder if it will ever get easier.</p> <p>Hannah, who used to run a veterinary laboratory, is the optimist. 'If I come down the field at sunset I do think how lucky we are.' Chris, on the other hand, is more likely to worry about the jobs left undone and the fact their mortgage is bigger now than it was when he was in full-time employment (although he still works regular days as a gearbox specialist for racing cars). 'There are more reasons to be low, than to be high.'</p> <p>Peter's Eden Farm is named after Hannah's father who died 11 years ago after a long illness and before he'd had a chance to retire from his job as a school teacher. His wife Liz, a 62-year-old retired doctors' receptionist, had always been interested in self-sufficiency. 'Oh yes,' she says. 'I always wanted the simple life. I would have been quite happy to live without electricity, to rough it. I never liked having to pay for things you could get yourself.' </p> <p>Hannah dreamt of giving her children the kind of childhood she'd enjoyed, but it took a few years before she could persuade Chris. 'There was a point after my dad died when Chris was always working in America. I just couldn't cope with it really. I kept thinking what's the point?' Finally, one evening, Chris came home to their ex-council house, dumped his bags and said: 'I've had enough. Let's do it.'</p> <p>'I didn't believe him at first,' says Hannah. 'I think he is a fantastic bloke for doing it. For taking the gamble.' But the new life didn't happen instantly. First their houses didn't sell and then, when they did, they struggled to find somewhere they could afford. In the end they found two adjoining houses. The woman in the corner shop tipped them off about the nearby land for sale. They bought it for \u00a340,000. </p> <p>They often wonder what Peter would think: his wife and daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, all living and working together off the land. On this they're all in agreement: he'd have been amazed. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.peterseden.com\">www.peterseden.com</a></p> <h2>The hobby farmers</h2> <p><strong>The urban couple who live the free-range lifestyle</strong></p> <p>Ask Shane Durston when he first thought about living off the land and he can pinpoint the exact moment 27 years ago. He grew up on council estates in Hackney and Catford. His parents were both 16 when he was born; five years later they broke up. By the time he was a teenager, he was getting into trouble with the police. Petty stuff, he recalls, like shoplifting. Finally he was given community service clearing up some woodland near where he lived. He was 15.</p> <p>'I thought it was rubbish,' he recalls. 'I thought I knew everything about everything.'</p> <p>But the quiet man who was in charge of the teenage boys for the day showed them where they could find wild mushrooms. Not only that, he picked some and took them back to his shed where he fried them in butter.</p> <p>'It stayed with me,' says Shane, 42. 'The idea of foraging, of the countryside, of getting something for nothing. There was this world out there I knew nothing about.' He stumbled across a copy of Food for Free by Richard Mabey in the library and started to find out more.</p> <p>It would be another 17 years, and one failed marriage, before he found someone who would share his dream. He met Emma at the Abbey National in Milton Keynes when she almost ran him over in the car park. He was working as an IT specialist; Emma was in the insurance department. 'I'd left school at 16, bought a house, got married, but it hadn't worked out,' says Emma, 35. 'I just sort of struggled on. </p> <p>I didn't know me. I didn't know what I wanted.' </p> <p>When the couple got together they started growing vegetables in their back garden (as well as clubbing, and driving a convertible and having foreign holidays. 'Oh, yes, we had all the toys,' says Shane). One day they went to a children's farm in Luton and, on the spur of the moment, came back with six pet hens.</p> <p>Five years on they're living in a modern three-bedroom house in a village called Spalding in Lincolnshire. The landscape is as flat as a dinner plate. The wind has a tendency to whistle through. On their 12 acres they have: 50 chickens (many of them rescued from battery farms), 14 Portland sheep, 10 pigs including Tamworths and Gloucester Old Spots, six ducks, five Dexter cows, five turkeys, two goats and two geese. Recently there's been a new addition to the menagerie. In the living room there's one baby boy, eight months. His name is Finley.</p> <p>There's a copy of John Seymour's updated classic The New Complete Book of Self Sufficiency on the coffee table. 'I don't mind the term hobby farmer,' says Shane. 'This is like my golf.' They have a small mortgage on the house which they bought for \u00a3250,000 as a result of a couple of judicious property deals in the Nineties: doing up houses and selling them on. </p> <p>'I'm a strong believer in mixing the new with the old,' says Shane. 'Look around: we've still got a big telly, but we've also got a wood-burning range. There is no reason why the two can't mix. Hobby farmer is an apt description: we mollycoddle our animals. They are a step down from pets.' Their pigs are named Del Boy, Rodney and Cassandra after the Trotter family in Only Fools and Horses</p> <p>At the moment Shane has dipped into their savings to take a year off work while Finley is a baby. But more usually you'd find them both ankle-deep in mud feeding and watering the animals at six in the morning before starting the hour-and-a-half drive into work. ('Helmets with torches on are invaluable,' says Emma.) All the jobs are shared, whether it's mucking out or taking the animals to the abattoir. They make a little extra money by advertising their pork from their website and selling jam and eggs at the gate. </p> <p>Emma loves the idea that they can sit down to a meal and know that everything they're about to eat they've either reared or grown from seed. Although not everyone agrees with her. One time some friends came to visit and when she served up one of their pigs as a roast ham their guests squeamishly pleaded to go to the pub for lunch instead. </p> <p>Ideally Shane would like to be able to cut back on his IT consultancy work and spend more time on the smallholding. He's built a biodiesel processor which means he can make 80 litres a day, all from waste vegetable oil. He hopes to run courses to show other people how to do it. Maybe, says Emma, they could do half-day chicken-keeping courses, too.</p> <p>'To be honest, if it meant that I could spend more time here,' Shane says, 'I'd flip burgers for a living. We both did our own thing before we met each other, but speaking for myself I am the happiest I have ever been.' Emma bounces Finley on her knees and nods in agreement. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.durston.co.uk\">www.durston.co.uk</a></p> <h2>The hardcore crofters</h2> <p><strong>The city professionals determined to be totally self-sufficient</strong></p> <p>Dennis and Linda Johnstone were up until 11.30 last night podding buckets of broad beans (or 'bloody broad beans' as Linda calls them) before boiling them up, blanching them, peeling them and popping them into recycled margarine boxes ready for the freezer. They toiled until Linda's fingers went black and she suggested they turn in for the night. She had to get up for the first day of the new term the following morning - she's a teacher at a nearby secondary school, and Dennis would be out in the rain at 6am feeding the pigs.</p> <p>The Johnstones may not be self sufficient, but they're as near as dammit. They live in a three-bedroom granite croft, with six acres attached, in the Aberdeenshire countryside, near a village called Insch. A Neolithic stone circle on the opposite side of the road suggests people have lived hereabouts for thousands of years. The mortgage - they bought the house in December 2003 for \u00a3200,000 - is paid by Linda's salary. Dennis, 42, stays at home to look after the house, and the youngest of their two sons, plus the vegetables and the livestock.</p> <p>He's grown enough potatoes to keep them going all year, the same goes for onions (he planted 1,200). They're rarely without the heavy-weight boxers of the veg patch - cabbage, kale, kohlrabi. Plus all the usual produce when it's in season. Most of the vegetables are grown in 14 beds on land which the previous owners used as a horse arena. Everything they don't eat immediately is frozen or pickled or made into chutney. Extra spuds are used for potato wine; spare apples, the ones that haven't been stewed and frozen, are turned into cider.</p> <p>They've whittled their weekly shopping bill for four of them down to \u00a335. 'Things like flour, oats, salt, vinegar, toilet rolls. The stuff we can't make ourselves,' says Dennis. 'The occasional exotic vegetable.' Like what? I wonder, imagining a yam or okra. 'Red peppers,' he replies.</p> <p>Dennis used to work in the media where he had all kinds of jobs from chief sub on Woman's Realm to a web specialist for the BBC to deputy editor on the Oxford Mail, but this is where he's always wanted to be ever since he grew up in Australia. 'I either wanted a farm, or a yacht.'</p> <p>At lunch time Linda, 45, pops back. She loves it here, but she's quicker than Dennis to admit it can be exhausting. 'It's like having a baby - you have no idea how hard it's going to be until you do it.' Early on, when everything kept going wrong, their friends suggested the croft might be cursed. The worst time was when their bore hole ran dry and Scottish Water refused to help them out. 'I can't remember how bad it was,' says Linda, while Dennis rustles up an omelette made with their eggs and fresh herbs, a salad from the garden. 'I've put it out of my mind.' For a month she had to shower at work and take the laundry into school. </p> <p>'It felt as though this place was fighting us,' she says. 'A lot of people who had lived here before had only lasted three or four years and at that point I thought I bloody well knew why.' The old days when she lived in Walthamstow and dressed in Nicole Farhi seemed a lifetime away. I wonder what her former colleagues in London would think. 'They'd be gobsmacked.'</p> <p>The neighbours thought they were 'mad eco hippies' when they moved in, according to Dennis. Maybe something to do with the fact that as far as possible he refuses to use any machinery. Three quarters of an acre of impacted earth destined for the potatoes was cultivated using a mattock and a crow bar; he cuts the grass with a scythe; he'd prefer to use a hoe over a tractor. 'It's a lot more satisfying,' he says. 'And it's also a money thing. Plus our carbon footprint. But we're definitely not hippies. What we're about is living more simply in a way that is satisfying to us and treading lightly at the same time.' Old nails are straightened out and used again. </p> <p>It helps, he adds, that he's bloody minded. </p> <p>'I work harder the grumpier I get,' he says. </p> <p>Solar panels mean they've cut their heating bills down. They ration their electricity consumption. The lights are turned off as much as possible. Dennis ferries the boys about on a Winther Kangaroo bike. The local police were amazed when he managed to do 26 miles an hour in a 20 mile-an-hour zone. </p> <p>Over time, the locals have come to respect the hard work they've put in. Their pedigree Berkshire weaners are snapped up when they put them up for sale. One of their ambitions is to help preserve the breed.</p> <p>'The locals know we're not dabbling,' says Dennis. 'They know we've got a mortgage. We're not like someone who has come here from the south of England and is living mortgage free and goes out to buy toy tractors and new land rovers.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dennis Johnstone's blog is at <a href=\"http://www.stonehead.wordpress.com\">stonehead.wordpress.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In Woody Allen's film Sleeper, the owner of a health food store called The Happy Carrot goes into hospital for a routine ulcer operation and wakes up 200 years later after a long snooze in a tank of liquid nitrogen. A bewildered Miles Monroe finds that society has changed considerably while he's been asleep, not least in its attitude to health. Contrary to what people thought in 1973, scientists have discovered that tobacco, cream pies and fried food are all good for you. </p> <p>Would wine feature on the same list if Allen were updating the movie now, setting it in 2208 instead of 2173? Health-wise, it doesn't belong in the same category as a jam doughnut or a packet of crisps, but to listen to some politicians, doctors and neo-temperance organisations, consuming more than two glasses of wine a day puts your vital organs in jeopardy and makes you a danger to society. If these voices have their way, it's possible that wine won't have much of a future. It will be regarded as a class A drug, dealt on street corners to addicts desperate for a fix of merlot, shiraz or pinot grigio. </p> <p>I take a contrasting view. Perhaps over-optimistically, I like to imagine that, by 2208, wine will be regarded, worldwide, as the alcoholic beverage of choice: a healthy, diverse, complex, food-enhancing drink that reflects its origins faithfully and honestly.</p> <p>But let's shorten our time span to something more conceivable. Instead of looking ahead 200 years, let's predict what the wine world will be like in 2058. The surprisingly forward-thinking St James's merchant Berry Brothers &amp; Rudd published a pamphlet on this very subject earlier this year, inspired by a look at its bestsellers in 1958 - German, fortified and sweet wines - all of which are struggling today. \"Fifty years ago,\" argues its avuncular chairman, Simon Berry, \"it would have been unthinkable to take wine lessons 'virtually' or predict supermarket shelves would be stocked with wines from China, Brazil, India or New Mexico.\" Perish the thought, dear boy.</p> <p>Some of Berry Brothers' predictions sound ludicrous to me - there's more chance of Hull City winning the Premiership this season than of someone developing genetically modified vines \"grown hydroponically in off-shore floating vineyards\" - but the pinstriped gents talk a lot of sense too, highlighting climate change, new producing countries (China, Brazil and India), lightweight packaging, better fraud detection, the death of natural corks, spiralling fine wine prices and the creation of rootless, global wine brands as important issues over the next half-century. </p> <p>To these I would add ethical trading, access to water for irrigation, consolidation (of retailers, producers and importers), as well as the growth of natural, organic and biodynamic wine as an antidote to anodyne, mass-market products.</p> <p>One of these issues is arguably more important than the rest put together. Dr Richard Smart, the world's most famous and well-travelled vineyard consultant, has described climate change as \"the biggest factor ever to affect the wine industry\", and that includes phylloxera, the vine louse that wiped out 90% of Europe's vineyards at the end of the 19th century when it was imported to southern France on some native North American vine cuttings. \"Climate change could bring new, insect-borne diseases,\" he says, \"but we are also going to see major changes in the world's wine styles as producers adapt to increased temperatures.\"</p> <p>The climate scientist Gregory Jones of Southern Oregon University has calculated that average growing season temperatures in the world's 27 leading wine regions have increased by 1.3\u00b0C over the past 50 years. More worryingly for many wine producers, he predicts a further increase of 2\u00b0C by 2050, with even greater rises in parts of Australia, the Iberian peninsula, southern France, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, Sicily and California, all of which may struggle to make drinkable wine.</p> <p>Increased temperatures aren't necessarily a bad thing. In some cool climate areas, they are a bonus. In the Saar region of Germany, the aristocratic Egon M\u00fcller has witnessed the phenomenon in his celebrated Scharzhofberg vineyard. \"In my father's day, we had two bad and two catastrophic harvests per decade. But since 1987 we haven't had a single bad vintage. We are very happy about global warming.\" Warmer temperatures have also been a significant factor in the number of good to great vintages in Bordeaux, the world's largest fine wine area, since the early 1980s. </p> <p>In some places, however, higher temperatures will be disastrous. One French academic has predicted that, if trends continue, the Champagne region could be as hot as Valencia is now by the end of this century, and that huge swathes of the world's existing vineyard land will be more like desert. For other, slightly luckier, winemakers climate change will mean shorter growing seasons, higher alcohol levels, unpredictable weather patterns (drought, hail, storms and rain) and a greater incidence of vineyard pests and diseases. Not quite the four horsemen of the apocalypse, but still a huge challenge.</p> <p>How will the wine business cope? There are two main options for producers: move your vineyards (to higher altitudes or cooler north or south-facing slopes, depending on which hemisphere you are in) or switch your grape variety, or varieties, to cope with higher temperatures. The age-old synergies between, say, tempranillo in Rioja, nebbiolo in Piedmont, merlot in Bordeaux or pinot noir in Burgundy will almost certainly have to change. It's not the end of the world - I would like to see how touriga nacional performs in the M\u00e9doc, for instance - but global warming will revolutionise the wines that we drink.</p> <p>On the plus side, there will be opportunities for countries that are now regarded as marginal players. Apart from English sparkling wine (which could be produced as far north as Yorkshire, according to one estimate), the future could smile on places such as Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Ukraine, Patagonia and Nova Scotia. It's not inconceivable that we could see grapes planted on the east coast of Ireland or even the Falkland Islands.</p> <p>None of these places will churn out huge volumes of wine. Two countries that might are China and India. Neither has produced any great bottles to date (Grover in India is the most promising name), but both have large, untapped populations of potential wine drinkers. Even if the Chinese don't take to wine, they may find ready markets elsewhere. Berry Brothers believes that China, already the world's sixth largest producer, will be \"the world's leading producer of volume wine by 2058\" and that it has \"the essential ingredients to rival the best of Bordeaux\". </p> <p>I'm not convinced by the second part of the argument. My hunch is that China's niche will be in wine's bargain basement, alongside other countries (South Africa, Argentina and a couple in eastern Europe) with a plentiful supply of cheap workers. The worst-case scenario is that China will become a vinous sweatshop, characterised by an exploited, under-aged, non-unionised labour force. If you want to continue to drink inexpensive plonk, it may well be at other people's expense.</p> <p>As wine becomes increasingly globalised, brand owners will source their grapes from a wider variety of countries, blending them to a consistent flavour and aroma profile like a soft drink. I've heard rumours of a company that is planning to set up business in Central America, shipping bulk wine from all over the world to a single location for blending and bottling. As long as the wine is cheap and tastes all right (after the addition of a few grams of sugar) its origin will be immaterial.</p> <p>Not all wine will fall into this sorry category, of course. I think we will see three types of wine in future: a small number of internationally traded, blue-chip fine wines (mainly bought by the very rich) at the top end, a large pool of more or less interchangeable brands made from pinot grigio, chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, cabernet sauvignon and merlot at the bottom, and in the middle, the affordable, interesting stuff which has a sense of place (what the French call \"terroir\").</p> <p>For reasons I've already outlined, that sense of place may not be what it is now. But I still believe that committed, quality-conscious producers will continue to make great wines. Many of them will employ traditional practices (hand picking and pruning, indigenous yeasts, wild fermentations) possibly using organic or even biodynamic methods in the vineyard. Give or take some of the wackier bits of biodynamism, a branch of what its early 20th-century inventor Rudolf Steiner dubbed \"spiritual science\", they will be using techniques that would have been familiar to their great grandfathers. The world of wine is changing at speed, but maybe not as fast as some people fear.</p>",
  "<p>Skilled immigrants from outside the European Union should be sent home when their four-year visas expire to limit the United Kingdom's population growth and ease pressure on public services, according to a controversial cross-party report by MPs.</p> <p>Tackling the politically explosive subject of immigration quotas head on, the study, headed by Frank Field and Nicholas Soames, former Labour and Tory ministers respectively, will call on ministers to balance the number of immigrants entering the country against those leaving.</p> <p>At present, the vast majority of non-EU entrants granted visas to work in this country stay on after they expire and are allowed to settle permanently. The Home Office is refining an Australian-style points system under which the number of immigrants from outside the EU will be restricted to those with suitable skills and qualifications.</p> <p>But critics say the system still amounts to an 'open door' for immigrants as no overall quota is imposed and rules about what happens after visas expire are not rigorously enforced.</p> <p>Under the Field-Soames model, the only chance non-EU immigrants would have of staying beyond their visa period would be if immigrants proved they had 'exceptional intellectual, scientific or artistic merit' and did not breach a new annual quota - to be set at 20,000 - which would include dependants.</p> <p>The report, drawn up by Migrationwatch, will be published ahead of a Home Office announcement on Tuesday revealing more details of its points-based permit system. It is expected to say that if immigrants wanted to extend their stay in the UK they would have to apply through a second points system. Only if they had 'exceptional' skills or qualifications, and their staying did not mean breaching the quota, could they stay.</p> <p>Field has long criticised Labour ministers for shying away from the immigration debate for political reasons, allowing the resulting problems of overcrowding and pressure on local services to mount. He warned two years ago that politicians had to begin discussing the problem in a grown-up way - before the British National Party took advantage.</p> <p>'It is only because the BNP are so inept that the debate has not taken off,' Field argued.</p> <p>The report, called 'Balanced Migration', claims such measures would limit England's population, now 51 million, to 65 million by 2050, compared with current projections suggesting it could rise to 78.6 million by the middle of the century.</p> <p>Habib Rahman, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: 'These proposals completely ignore the positive contribution migrants make to life in the UK. As well as much-needed skilled workers, many come and do unskilled jobs that need to be done, but for which employers are unable to find home-grown workers.' </p> <p>Figures issued last month from the Office for National Statistics found that inward migration to Britain had reached its highest level since the current method of counting was introduced, with 605,000 long-term immigrants arriving in the year to mid-2007.</p>",
  "<p>The reputation of the Scots as a hard-drinking, hard-fighting nation is not one that I am proud of. In Scotland, we have a particular problem with alcohol - a culture of drinking to get drunk. In this, we are by no means unique; other countries are also suffering the effects of alcohol misuse. But we are taking action and we sent a very clear signal last week that we will not be diverted from tackling this issue. As the First Minister said, we will introduce legislation this parliamentary term to bring in tough measures designed to turn the tide on irresponsible drinking. </p> <p>The detail of exactly what those measures will be is still being worked on. Our consultation - on minimum pricing, banning irresponsible promotions in off-sales, introducing a social responsibility fee and raising the age for the purchase of alcohol in off-sales - finishes this week. </p> <p>Some people may think we can be persuaded not to go ahead, but that is simply not the case. We have a problem that's costing us at least \u00a32.25bn a year, flooding our health service, undermining our economy and filling up our jails. The case for action is clear.</p> <p>There has been speculation that some retailers will seek ways to get round the measures. There is a suggestion, for example, that they may simply put marketing budgets into internet sales, driving customers to buy alcohol through irresponsible deals on the web which will then be delivered to their home from stores elsewhere. </p> <p>This is coupled with tales of huge distribution hangars that will be set up near the border to flood Scotland with cheap drink from England - lorries covering vast chunks of the country with the three for two deals that may be outlawed here. </p> <p>We recognise that we alone can't stop this. Neither can we alone stop other rumoured ways round our tough action on alcohol. Take bootlegging as another example: the white van man travelling to supermarkets in England and stocking up on cheap alcohol to sell behind a pub in the East End of Glasgow. It makes a change from people going from the South Coast to Calais, but that doesn't make it right and it doesn't mean we shouldn't take action.</p> <p>Much of this may be scaremongering by vested interests to try and lead us to the conclusion that we might as well not bother. But that is simply not an option. We can't legislate to stop some of these things, but we're determined to press ahead with our radical plans and look for support where we can.</p> <p>I believe that cross-border co-operation is important. Alcohol misuse doesn't stop at the border. I don't believe that there's not a problem in Carlisle or Newcastle the same as there is in Dumfries or Edinburgh. </p> <p>I want to work with our colleagues in the UK government to build on what we're doing in Scotland and make sure people can't exploit the situation and undermine our drive for tough action. Clearly the UK government's approach is slightly different, so are English and Welsh licensing laws. But they are still committed to tackling alcohol misuse and I want to work with them and make sure the whole of the United Kingdom benefits.</p> <p>Similarly, I know that many supermarkets and retailers recognise the problem with alcohol in Scotland and I welcome that. Many of them have brought in measures to become more responsible sellers of alcohol - Challenge 25 and delisting some very cheap high-strength products in some of their stores. These moves are definitely a step in the right direction.</p> <p>We are not anti-alcohol. We are anti-alcohol misuse. It's not the drink, it's how we are drinking it. I want to work with the industry to encourage more responsible consumption, promotion and retailing. But that must be in conjunction with further regulatory measures. </p> <p>We need to change the culture around alcohol in Scotland. We need to rebalance our relationship with alcohol and the time is right to do that. In my view, this is similar to the change in attitudes to smoking. Fifty years ago, smoking was a social norm - on the bus, in the cinema and in bars. It's not any more. </p> <p>At the time banning smoking in public places was being considered, the tobacco industry criticised governments for taking action, saying, for example, that there was insufficient evidence of its effects or that legislation wouldn't work - some of the same arguments we hear about alcohol today. But it did work with smoking. Culture change took time, but we now have a very different attitude to smoking. I believe it can work with alcohol misuse. I believe it's worth a try. </p> <p>The scale of the problem in Scotland is too great to sit back and do nothing. So I will to work with my colleagues in Westminster and those who sell alcohol. I will take tough action. I will stand up and be counted and try to make Scotland safer, stronger and healthier.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kenny MacAskill is the Cabinet Secretary for Justice</p>",
  "<p>In Houston, Houma and Hilton Head, hurricanes habitually happen. But that doesn't mean they're much of a news story outside the American cable TV loop. Mostly, indeed, they can prove a bit of a bore, a puddle of anticlimax after days of frantic foreplay - the no-change of climate change.</p> <p>Thus, last week, the Times saw 'a million flee the Big Easy' as Gustav closed in, pounding towards force 4. New Orleans was either 'braced' for disaster or 'evacuated' according to whether you wanted to get excited with the Sun or the Telegraph.</p> <p>'Second time unlucky?' asked the Indie front page. Prepare for the 'mother of all storms', warned an anxious mayor. 'Get your butts out of here.' An injunction largely ignored by reporters from around the globe, who backed their butts bravely into the eye of destruction. Republican convention suspended; presidential plans upended.</p> <p>It was all pulsating stuff. Except that poor old Gustav got tired somewhere out in the Gulf, downgraded to category one and veered west at the last minute, skilfully skirting any major area of population. 'Phew, Orleans!' said a sweating Sun. But keep the faith and the big type handy, brothers. Hurricane Hanna is out there waiting to do it all over again - and prevent any meaningful, but highly necessary, pause for media or political thought. </p> <p>Of course, killer hurricanes like Katrina can be huge stories. Of course, the 94-plus souls who died on Gustav's journey across the Caribbean matter (though you wouldn't have guessed that from most US or UK coverage). Of course, mayors, presidents and candidates need to sound an alarm. But there is a continuing price to be paid here.</p> <p>It's not just the squelch of high drama deflated, the sense that next time (or the time after) millions will find fleeing a tedious option. In many ways, the defiance of science is even more dismaying. Two big polls in America and Britain this summer told the same story - 45 per cent of Americans asked what caused global warming said 'natural causes' or 'case unproven'. In the UK, 60 per cent of respondents told Ipsos-Mori that scientists weren't sure what triggered climate change - and 40 per cent thought it might not be as bad as painted anyway. In short, you can have 2,500 scientists all signed up to the same grim hymn sheet - but still not commanding belief.</p> <p>Who do you blame for that? Mediamen blame the media, naturally enough. George Monbiot of the Guardian finds Channel Four at the root of all evil, and affronted scientists join him in that charge. Yet the spectacle of Gus running out of gas raises a somewhat different hypothesis.</p> <p>The entire weight of the White House, its scientific advisers and its climate service warned of impending tragedy. Every TV weather forecast had its red ball of destruction rolling in. A million souls rolled out of town. And yet, in essence, very little transpired.</p> <p>'Gustav does its worst but New Orleans survives,' said an almost reproachful Guardian headline. Gustav's worst was simply not bad enough... And, in turn, that raises an awkward emotional hiatus. The god of science, speaking via assorted oracles, thinks it knows what cities will be under water by 2050, which lands will be burnt and arid by 3000 - but it can't tell us, here and now, where a hurricane will hit in five hours' time, or with what velocity. And the contrast opens wide. 'Phew!' - the blinking Bun is mopping its brow. Take your tablets of doom with a pinch of salt. Scientific prophesy, as my dad used to say, can be 'all wind and water'.</p> <p>Now, I don't doubt the threat or reality of climate change. It's ominous that such a threat isn't widely believed - and widely thought to be exaggerated. But have we - the scientists, the politicians, the hacks - got our tone of voice right? Every step we take is complex, and pretty uncertain. (A press seminar I was at recently saw one distinguished green belabouring another for daring to link hurricane frequency to global warming.) Tracking Gustav's last offshore hours isn't like measuring polar ice caps, to be sure. Moving butts in a bind isn't like mapping rainforests. </p> <p>But credibility is common to both, and crucial. It counts when the likes of Hanna and Ike threaten devastation - and when they don't. So it's time to ask, more deeply, why the public's scepticism about climate change is growing, not fading. And every assertion we make has to be argued in detail stripped of hysteria, not wrapped in the mother of all hyperbole.</p>",
  "<p>Dr Frederic Brandt has several claims to fame. He is, for instance, the largest user of injectable collagen and Botox - in the world. 'I just love fillers!' he tells me. And how. When we meet at his New York clinic he wastes no time in revealing that he regularly injects himself. </p> <p>'The last session I did was six-and-a-half vials!' His face is a smooth, jowl-free mask. Imagine a tub of frozen yoghurt, not a single line or wrinkle. He is cosmetic medicine's Peter Pan.</p> <p>In fact, in the 25 years since he began practising (Brandt set up shop in 1982 after completing both an oncology and dermatology residency at medical school in Philadelphia) he has personally tested every procedure and product he uses in his clinics - on himself.</p> <p>All of which has made the 59-year-old Brandt surreally young-looking, and very rich. He is the Baron of Botox, the King of Collagen. His clients pay up to $7,000 for a full face of injections and come to him from all over the world, some as often as six times a year. </p> <p>Now he's becoming increasingly well known as the doctor behind the 'New New Face'. He specialises in what's called the Y Lift, where filler is injected into the area just below the cheekbones. Ten years ago women wanted their cheeks and foreheads to be pulled, stretched and tightened, like vacuum-packed pieces of steak. These days they arrive in his consulting rooms demanding something more youthful and plush. Think of a plumped-up cushion. Out with pinched, in with peachy. There's a new face around - and it's a baby's.</p> <p>Jonathan Van Meter, a writer at New York magazine and US Vogue, blames fashion and celebrity glossies filled with images of teenagers for the New New aesthetic. 'Their faces are plump and dewy and flushed with youth. As thin as their bodies are, they still haven't entirely shed the baby fat on their faces. This is what women in their forties and fifties are now after: baby fat.'</p> <p>The idea that New York women want to make their faces fatter seems counter-intuitive when they're in a desperate battle to get the rest of their bodies, from the neck downwards, down to a Hot-Box-yoga-honed, 800-calories-a-day size zero, but the current theory is that what they need to keep their faces looking young is volume. </p> <p>Someone like Cher, according to Van Meter, is the essence of the old way of doing things: tight skin, trout pout, skinny nose. On the other hand, Demi Moore epitomises the New New Face - youthful skin, defined cheekbones and chin, heart-shaped face. Industry insiders report that in MST (Movie Star Time) clients want to look the way they did four films ago - or about eight years in RPT (Regular People Time). As Van Meter quips: 'The New New Face is really your old face.'</p> <p>They may say their dewy glow is all down to healthy eating and exercise, but increasingly it's more likely due to a new regime of fillers and injectables. In the US, there has been a 754 per cent increase in the number of non-surgical procedures since 1997 compared to a 114 per cent rise in surgery. Dermatologists are the new glamour doctors and Dr Brandt is one of the biggest players, with two clinics - one on East 34th Street in Manhattan, the other in Miami; two best-selling books including Ten Minutes/Ten Years: Your Definitive Guide to a Beautiful and Youthful Appearance, and a successful anti-ageing skincare range that is sold in 40 countries. </p> <p>We meet at the beginning of a typical working day - 27 clients, 10 hours, seven consulting rooms. Brandt, who gets up at 6.30am, has already done an hour and a half of Ashtanga yoga. Hanging on the wall just outside his office is a giant framed photograph by the fashion photographer Steven Klein. (Brandt is a fan of contemporary art. His collection includes Richard Prince, Damien Hirst, Gilbert &amp; George.) In the foreground, a toned, tanned, naked man lies by a pool while lurking in the background is Dr Brandt himself, wielding aloft a giant needle. </p> <p>'What can we do for you today?' Dr Brandt asks a New York society hostess, who has homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons. She is, I estimate, about 50, dressed in a navy ensemble of Chanel cardigan, capri pants and ballet flats, and a diamond ring the size of a golf ball.</p> <p>'I'm a mess,' she mumbles out of the side of her mouth, which she can barely move due to the anaesthetic cream smeared all over her face. </p> <p>'I've been under such stress.' Her skin - or what I can see of it beneath all the gloop - looks great to me, much better than mine, but she is adamant that she looks awful: 'Make me look younger! Lift me up! I have to be in a photo shoot on Wednesday.' </p> <p>Brandt starts on her cheeks with Perlane, a favourite filler of his because it gives volume to the mid-face and jaw (it is a hyaluronic acid, made from the by-products of the fermentation of strep bacteria). 'It's all about having those convex surfaces to reflect light,' he trills. </p> <p>Each time the Perlane is squirted into the apple of the cheek the tissue puffs up a little and a bright spot of blood oozes out. This is dashed away with a wad of surgical tissue. Squirt. Puff. Squirt. Puff. Chanel lady's cheeks inflate like a bicycle tyre. </p> <p>'Oooh, that looks fabulous,' Brandt says, admiring his handiwork. 'Am I right?' Yes, yes, I say. She does look fabulous, in a slightly disconcerting way - the image of a Hitchcock blonde with bruised cheeks. </p> <p>Brandt's assistant, dressed in the staff uniform of black scrubs, passes another hypodermic needle, and Brandt injects amounts into the fine lines under the eye. Zap - a line disappears. Zap. There goes another. Now the Cosmoderm comes out, a collagen used to combat the very fine feather lines that form in the naso-labial area of the face. On and on it goes.</p> <p>'How about the lips?' he inquires.</p> <p>'I'm so afraid of looking puffy,' she says.</p> <p>'OK, just a little then.' Brandt squirts Juvederm around the lips just above the vermilion border.</p> <p>'I don't tell anyone, not even my daughter,' the grande dame reveals, shooting me a look as she clasps a Latex glove containing frozen peas to her bruised cheeks. 'My fianc\u00e9, who is 16 years younger than me, said, \"You wouldn't put that stuff in your face, would you?\"' She denied it. 'I don't mind getting older....' She tells me. 'As long as I don't look it.' </p> <p>Now it is time for the big guns: Botulinum toxin, better known as Botox, one of the most powerful nerve poisons known to man. Brandt uses so much of it he calls it Bo for short. </p> <p>'Frown, relax, frown, relax,' he instructs, injecting between her eyebrows and then along the imperceptible furrows of her forehead. There's a pause as he reloads with more ammunition. </p> <p>'What happened to Jocelyn?' asks the grande dame in a regretful tone of voice, referring to the ex-wife of the art dealer Alec Wildenstein whose face was made so unrecognisable by surgery that she is now known as 'the Bride of Wildenstein'. 'She's so intelligent. Why did she do that to herself? She was so beautiful.'</p> <p>'People don't see themselves,' Brandt sighs, without irony, jabbing more Botox into the taut muscles of her neck and grimacing as he pulls out the needle. 'It's the same as anorexics. They don't see themselves.' </p> <p>Chanel lady concurs. 'They become obsessed.' Later, I discover she is, incredibly, 70. </p> <p><strong>In a break between clients Brandt snacks on </strong>spinach and beans. His father owned a sweet shop in Newark, New Jersey, and died early from juvenile diabetes at the age of 47. His son, too, used to have 'the worst sweet tooth' until as an adult he decided to wean himself off sugar by embarking on a programme which has been so successful he has never come off it. It is a diet completely devoid of sugar, wheat in any form, any grains with gluten, yeast, juice, dairy, root vegetables, and most fruit, and he recommends you try it.</p> <p>He's wearing a grey and black Prince of Wales check jacket, nipped in at the waist; white Dolce &amp; Gabbana shirt covered in zips; olive green designer camouflage pants; blinding metallic Gucci sneakers; and purple Alain Mikli glasses that offset his blond hair. It's an outr\u00e9 get-up that chimes with his uncannily youthful complexion. </p> <p>When, I ask, did he first start using Botox on his clients? 'In the early Nineties.'</p> <p>How often should clients see you? 'Injectables are recommended every four to five months.'</p> <p>How young is the youngest person he has seen? 'Probably early twenties,' he says. 'I think in the mid-thirties most people start showing their age.' </p> <p>How about reports of the dangers of Botox? 'Perfectly safe.' </p> <p>At what point does he think having cosmetic procedures can go too far? 'When it's your only focus. When it becomes not a part of your life but your entire life. Instead of enhancing your life, it takes over your life. Ready to go?' </p> <p>Brandt is off again, skipping like a mountain goat. </p> <p>The next client is a chic, fine-boned wife and grandmother who divides her time between a house in Palm Beach and an apartment in New York. She has been a Brandt client for two years. </p> <p>'I'm seeing the ex-husband on Saturday, so we don't want bruising,' she teases Brandt, smiling through the anaesthetic. (This can be a teeth-grittingly painful procedure. Bruising can last anywhere between two days and two weeks.) Dressed in black skinny jeans, Chanel cardigan, white sneakers, her YSL bag on a nearby chair, she looks the picture of a youthful fiftysomething. She tells me she is 65. I nearly fall over. </p> <p>Brandt begins by injecting Perlane into her cheeks. 'This is what we're using to add volume and it pulls the whole face up. You can see that, right? It gives volume to the jaw.' </p> <p>I ask her how often she sees Dr Brandt. 'I come more often than most because I'm a little more vain,' she says. 'I've had plastic surgery. With surgery the ageing process still continues. I think this keeps you looking like you did when you first had plastic surgery, kind of fresh. It's a perfect way to maintain your appearance. It's so natural-looking.' </p> <p>'Your lips are holding up great,' Brandt says as he reaches for the Cosmoderm. </p> <p>Do the needles hurt? I wonder. 'My husband always asks that,' she replies. 'I tell him, \"However much it hurts - it's worth it\".' Why did she start? 'You think you look fine, and then one day your hair is white, and you have a cold and you're wearing no make-up, and you walk into the bakery and they ask you if you have ARP [the US equivalent of qualifying as an OAP].'</p> <p>According to Brandt, what we notice when people age is the fact that their cheeks start dripping down, and they begin to lose volume in the upper face which causes sagging in the lower face. We lose, he says, our 'youthful convexities'. What he means is that instead of having beautiful even uninterrupted cheeks, our faces end up as a series of hills and valleys. 'A facelift is good for tightening but it doesn't do anything for volume loss.' Which is where the New New face comes in.</p> <p>Next door a pretty thirtysomething New York career girl is waiting for Brandt in a state of panic because her skin has been frozen by Botox, the result of visiting another dermatologist.</p> <p>'I can't feel my eyebrows,' she wails. Her forehead is completely unlined, like a block of ice. 'I can't inject anything to take it away,' Brandt says sadly. 'But eventually the movement will come back.' He lifts her brows slightly with a couple of judiciously placed Botox injections and tells her to be patient. </p> <p>Next we see a 50-year-old New Yorker, who has had a full face and neck of injections from Brandt and looks completely overdone, her lips verging on the trout pout. 'I always tell him, \"Do it more!\" she says. 'But that's just my personality.' </p> <p>And after her we see a 26-year-old brunette from Miami who in my opinion shouldn't have been let within 10 miles of a cosmetic dermatologist's office. Tanned and eager, she holds a hand mirror two inches from her nose throughout the 10-minute session. </p> <p>'Ooh, I've never had that before!' she exclaims as Brandt uses filler on her jawline. 'Awesome. I'll get hooked. Ooh, you're so good.' </p> <p>Wasn't she too young? I asked Brandt afterwards. 'She had some fine lines around her lips,' he shrugs.</p> <p>Later we enter the room of a woman who is one of Brandt's most devoted clients. A very attractive 49-year-old wife and mother, she flies from Switzerland to New York six times a year to see him. </p> <p>'Two-and-a-half years I'm coming,' she says, eyes shining. 'She's got a lot of air miles,' Dr Brandt says, smiling. He's using an Aluma laser on her d\u00e9colletage, a non-burning laser that sucks up the skin and makes it contract, which stimulates the production of more collagen. </p> <p>'Ooh, look at that!' he says, hoovering her skin. 'I'm going to throw you off that chair and put myself on.' </p> <p>I ask her why she first decided to have cosmetic procedures. 'It's just a thing in your life,' she says, with some drama. 'You reach a certain age. It's not that we're just stupid chickens with too much money who want to look 20 or 30 years old again. It's not that your husband or your boyfriend or whatever is losing interest. There's just a point, it comes for every woman, when you reach a certain age, and the skin looks wrinkly and suddenly you're miserable. For beautiful women, this is hard.' </p> <p>She pauses for a minute. 'My mother, somehow she looked like she gave up on her life. She just did needlework and made tea. Suddenly she was closed and stopped socialising. I think surgery is a big risk, so I had to decide [whether or not to get fillers]. I would never change my doctor now.'</p> <p>She beams at Brandt. 'He listens to you. This makes you feel so good. You know, I have two children. My son and his friend were over and his friend said, \"You have a very young mother\". I felt wonderful!' </p> <p>How Dr Brandt's clients love him. As he races, sneakers flashing, between his brightly lit examining rooms you can almost feel the place throbbing with desire. You begin to see why people call this the female yuppie heroin. Every woman I see leaves his office with a beatific smile on her face, as if she was in the throes of a grand passion. It may be calamitous on the bank balance, but is it so morally reprehensible? I begin to wonder if just a little judiciously placed Botox might not be a good idea, after all.</p> <p>Between clients, I ask Dr Brandt for an assessment of my own 40-year-old skin. How would I get the New New face? 'I think you need to take care of your skin,' he says, 'make it more radiant. I think you need some volume in your cheeks,' he continues. 'And under your eyes and around your eyes.' He thinks for a minute. 'And then we could do some Botox around your eyes and your forehead... And fill in your cheeks where they're getting hollow. Those can be filled in with collagen.' He thinks again. 'And then we could do some laser treatment.' </p> <p>To say I was despondent is an understatement. </p> <p>It's 6.30pm. Among Brandt's last patients of the day are a husband and wife who sit swathed in white blankets with white anaesthetic on their faces, a slightly nervous air about them. A handsome couple, they are both successful - she is a colourist at a leading New York salon; he owns a furniture shop in SoHo. </p> <p>'How long have you two been married?' Brandt asks, skipping about the room. </p> <p>'Nineteen years,' the husband says.</p> <p>'Where do you get your energy from?' he asks Brandt, who is now singing 'Younger than Springtime'.</p> <p>'Not really from my mom or dad. But I was always a little different in my family. Everyone was quiet and reserved and there I was, putting on those Broadway plays in the living room!'</p> <p>More syringes come out for the wife, who is now wincing a little from the pain. I mention that I had witnessed one client that day, a yoga fanatic, whose pain threshold was so high she didn't have any anaesthetic cream.</p> <p>'Wow, no anaesthetic?' they both say, horrified.</p> <p>'When I inject myself I never numb,' Brandt chimes in. The last session I was six-and-a-half vials! I think I'd better stop!' Brandt is hitting his stride now. 'I always say, it's lucky I work here or I'd need to go on a payment plan!'</p> <p>The husband climbs up on the chair. 'You look like a schoolboy now!' says Brandt, syringes flying. 'You know,' he adds, 'I always say, this is the only doctor's office where if you can't move, you're happy.' </p> <h2>The New Ideal Face</h2> <p><strong>Madonna, 50, Elizabeth Hurley, 43, Demi Moore, 45, all have the perfect face</strong></p> <p><strong>Forehead </strong>is smooth and wrinkle-free (can be achieved by Botox injections).</p> <p><strong>Eyes</strong> look wide with no deep lines (this look can be achieved by injecting filler under the lower lids).</p> <p><strong>Nose</strong> is straight (an upturned tip, the sign of a nose job, is no longer in vogue).</p> <p><strong>Lips</strong> are full and turn up slightly at sides (puffy 'trout pouts' are out).</p> <p><strong>Cheeks</strong> are plump (filler can be injected just below the cheekbones to create a fuller, young shape).</p> <p>There is no suggestion that the women mentioned above have had cosmetic work.</p>",
  "<h2>Letter of the week</h2> <p>My partner and I want to visit the Lofoten Islands off northern Norway, but quotes for our 10-day trip have been beyond our budget of \u00a3800-1,000 each. Could you suggest a good alternative that will offer coastline, walking, contemporary self-catering accommodation and, most importantly, peace and quiet. We are hoping to travel in the first week of October.<br><strong>Kerry Turner, by email</strong></p> <p>You could still make it to the Lofotens on your budget. Though Norway is undoubtedly expensive, there are some good-value air links, especially out of season. Norwegian (<a href=\"http://www.norwegian.no\">norwegian.no</a>) flies from Edinburgh to Bodo with return fares from \u00a3200. From there, you can hop on a ferry to Svolv\u00e6r, the most southerly of the islands, and perfect for killer whale-watching trips. There's plenty of self-catering available. Try Svinoya (<a href=\"http://www.svinoya.no\">svinoya.no</a>), which has one-bed cabins from \u00a390 per night. The islands are an inclement place to visit outside summer - in October you can expect temperatures of around 5C. Come equipped for wind and rain. Closer to home, the Hebrides have a similarly dramatic coastline and unspoilt feel. Flights from Inverness to Stornaway cost from \u00a342.50 each way. For accommodation check out <a href=\"http://www.visithebrides.com\">visithebrides.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I am going to Central America in early January, for more than two months. The trip is organised through Frontier, and the cost is already quite expensive without flights. It starts in Mexico City, so I need to fly there, and finishes in Costa Rica. In order to keep the cost down I want to book a return flight to Mexico City, but this means when we finish in Costa Rica in mid-March I need to somehow get back to Mexico City in time for my return flight. Flights seem quite expensive, and a bit unreliable, but the only other option I can think of is travelling by bus. Is this the only way?<br><strong>Alice Priestley, Horsham, West Sussex</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Options are now limited to bus or flying. Although Paul Theroux rode the rails through much of Latin America for his 1979 classic The Old Patagonian Express, not much remains of the services he took. Intercity services in Mexico and Guatemala were suspended in the late 1990s and services in El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica are very limited or nonexistent, though freight services operate in some countries.</p> <p>As it sounds like time is tight, I would make two suggestions. First, if you haven't booked your ticket yet you should be able to arrange an open-jaw route from London, into Mexico City and out of San Jos\u00e9 at little more than the cost of a regular return. Second, Taca or Mexicana fly daily from San Jos\u00e9 to Mexico City. Fares for the three-hour flight will be around \u00a3250. Buy your ticket when you get to Costa Rica. Frontier may also have some suggestions as there must be a few of you in the same position.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My husband and I would like to take a cruise for our wedding anniversary, either to South America or the Arctic, but we are worried about the environmental issues. I read something recently that said cruising was worse for the planet than flying. Is this true? And are there any cruise lines that can truly be called 'green'? We would love to see a wilderness area.<br><strong>Lucy Metcalfe, Canterbury, Kent</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> It is true that cruising - at least on the mega-ships - does have serious environmental question marks. The biggest ships are rather like floating cities, which means they generate a similar amount of waste, all of which has to go somewhere. Until recently, this was often simply emptied into the sea, but most of the cruise lines have upped their green credentials recently, with rubbish compactors and water recycling plants on board. The best answer is to opt for a smaller ship; there are several companies that operate ships with a capacity of around 150 people. You can often reach more secluded areas and the atmosphere on board is much more personal. </p> <p>If you want to see Ecuador and the Galapagos, or the Arctic, Lindblad Expeditions (00 1 212 765 7740; <a href=\"http://www.expeditions.com\">expeditions.com</a>) operates in conjunction with National Geographic, and is committed to ensuring tourism and conservation can co-exist. Ships take no more than 100 people, and the company has raised more than \u00a32.5m for conservation projects. Other ethical cruising companies are Cruise West (00 1 888 8518133; <a href=\"http://www.cruisewest.com\">cruisewest.com</a>) and Sanctuary Cruising (<a href=\"http://www.sanctuarycruising.com\">sanctuarycruising.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I read that XL Airlines has cancelled all flights to the Caribbean, citing high fuel costs. I have flights booked with XL next month and am worried, after the recent collapse of the budget airline Zoom, that XL may go under too. If it does, will I receive compensation? And are there any arrangements between airlines so that stranded - or pre-booked - passengers can transfer onto other flights?<br><strong>James Kay, Monmouth, Wales</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> If you book a flight directly with an airline, and that company goes bust then there is almost no chance that you will receive compensation from the airline. Occasionally other airlines will offer reduced fares to help people return home, but this is not the case with outbound flights from the UK. If you booked the flight with a credit card, the credit card company should refund you the money if the airline goes out of business. The other option is airline failure insurance, most travel agents will offer this, or talk to your own insurer. If, however, your flight is part of a package then you have nothing to worry about; all tour operator packages are Atol-protected, and if the airline fails then the tour operator you have booked with is legally required to make alternative arrangements for you. </p> <h2>Feedback</h2> <p>In response to Mrs Walker's Argentina question (Letters, last week), my friend and I were in Argentina last February and we managed to do some short hikes in the Salta area. We booked ours through Norte Trekking (which I think we found in our Lonely Planet guide). Frederico does a variety of hikes for all abilities and different durations around Chile and Argentina. He was a fantastic guide and also spoke fluent English which was a great help as our Spanish was limited at that point.

  "<h2>Music can change all children's lives</h2> <p>We agree classical music can and does speak to children from all backgrounds, whether they live in Hackney or Harrow, 'Liverpool gets its Rattle back' (Review, last week) .</p> <p>The government wants to give all primary-age children the opportunity to learn a musical instrument and for many thousands, this will mean learning traditional classical instruments such as the violin and clarinet. To support this, we have made \u00a342m available to buy instruments.</p> <p>Our new project In Harmony, inspired by Venezuela's El Sistema, will see children come together in the 'family' of the symphony orchestra and learn traditional orchestral instruments. At the same time, they will learn social skills and discipline.</p> <p>Children and young people will inevitably choose what music they want to listen to and play, but it is my responsibility to ensure that they are exposed to the widest possible variety. Music, as well as being fun and uplifting in its own right, can change lives. <br><strong>Andrew Adonis</strong><br>Schools Minister<br>London SW1</p> <h2>Attack was unfair</h2> <p>It is a pity a balanced article about academies ('Children of the revolution', OM, last week) was spoilt by an unfair personal attack on one of our members. </p> <p>The sad truth is that some children will never be able to pass five GCSEs regardless of where they go to school, but that does not mean their teachers do not care about them and their futures. Teachers want all pupils to be able to attend schools with the best resources and facilities and the best chance to achieve their potential. </p> <p>We believe that if the money invested in academies was fairly invested across all schools, it would benefit a far greater number of children, not just the few attending those academies. <br><strong>Mary Bousted</strong><br>General Secretary<br>Association of Teachers and Lecturers <br>London WC2</p> <h2>Talk of immigration isn't racist </h2> <p>Thank you, Andrew Anthony, for raising your head above the parapet ('The time has come to say Britain is full', Comment, last week). To discuss immigration policy is not racist. Many rational people believe that increasing numbers of humans globally will exacerbate the effects of climate change and that increasing numbers in the UK will not only make it more difficult for us to put in place initiatives to fight the effects of climate change, but also make life even less pleasant than it is for those already here. </p> <p>It was clear when, in 2004, the government invited citizens of the EU accession states to seek work here, that they used only an economic template. They failed to realise that people are not automatons and that although initially single people would come, improved economic circumstances would bring their families to join them. They failed to plan for the effects of a potentially large inflow of migrants on housing, schools, the NHS, water consumption and our roads.</p> <p>Perhaps new EU citizens, and those whose countries are safe and prosperous, should be encouraged to stay at home and build up their own countries. Perhaps, too, many of us would prefer to offer a chance to some of the poorest people of the world. <br><strong>Petra Ross</strong><br>London NW3</p> <h2>Why criminals join up</h2> <p>As a social worker in youth justice, I found your piece 'Record numbers of ex-soldiers in jail as combat leaves mental scars' (News, last week) most alarming. However, I never cease to be amazed by the number of young men with whom I work who state a desire to join the armed forces despite being involved in significant offending behaviour. </p> <p>The need for fresh young recruits seems to override the need to ensure that they satisfy basic minimum standards and the potential risk they may be to others. It is alarming to think of so many troubled and troubling young men being entrusted with the right to exercise the use of lethal force. <br><strong>David Orr</strong><br>Edinburgh</p> <h2>Vowel control, Carole</h2> <p>In 'Forget Rock, make tracks for marvellous Mwnt' (Escape, 24 August), Carole Cadwalladr claims to be Welsh, but says: 'I still find myself making snarky metropolitan comments ...'

Are you still with me? - and my very favourites, the delightful Plwmp and the marvellous Mwnt. Repeat after me, Rhosllanerchrugog, Dwygfylchi, Blaenllechau.'</p> <p>Vowellessness names, indeed! Whereas the English possesses only five - a, e, i, o, u - Welsh has seven mellifluous vowels: a, e, i, o, u, w, y.

I cannot describe how heartening it was to read that we are not alone. </p> <p>I love being in the classroom with the children: that is the only reason I continue with my job. Why can't we be allowed to do the job we trained for? </p> <p>Another effect is that not enough good teachers who would make excellent heads have any desire to do the job. This results in a minority group of people being appointed to 'lead' schools who are either not suited or even able to carry out their role effectively.

  "<p>The BBC faces a difficult choice when dealing with serious art. It has a public service obligation to reach as wide an audience as possible but in doing so, it risks simplifying its subject and, in the process, corrupting it. </p> <p>The essence of that dilemma was neatly expressed by Katie Derham, ITN news anchor and Classic FM presenter, in BBC2's Maestro last week. She was one of five remaining celebrity contestants in a competition to learn the art of conducting an orchestra. Her challenge was to take charge of 'O Sole Mio'. On discovering this, Derham, confident of her impeccable highbrow credentials, dared to say what pretty much every British person thinks when they hear that melody: 'The ice cream song!'</p> <p>That moment confirmed to me that Maestro is the perfect BBC television programme, the apogee of public service broadcasting. Well, maybe not. But it at least goes some way to solving what might be called the Cornetto Question: can the BBC target arts programmes at the majority who think of gondoliers whenever they hear that famous song, without alienating the minority who don't (or pretend they don't)?</p> <p>On paper, Maestro is just another tawdry derivation of the reality TV formula. Imagine the pitch: 'Strictly Come Dancing meets Faking It at the Proms.' The sublime backed into a corner, fending off drunken advances from the ridiculous. Yet somehow it manages to be brilliant. </p> <p>This Tuesday's final will be between comedian Sue Perkins, drum 'n' bass DJ Goldie and actress Jane Asher. Derham was, I feel, unjustly expelled last week, but my opinion didn't count. Experts - conductors, composers, musicians - award points. Then members of the BBC Concert Orchestra vote to finish off one of the lowest-scoring performers. </p> <p>This system subverts a basic premise of most reality TV by abandoning any pretence that the public's judgment is worth something. What does the average punter know about the technical merits of orchestra conductors, how clear their up beats are and whether or not they cue in pizzicato correctly? Nothing. Is that elitism? Yes. Musical virtuosity is the province of an elite and there is nothing morally abhorrent about that. The only thing that makes elites intolerable is when membership is based on criteria other than talent. Participation in classical music is exclusive because the training required, even just the ownership of an instrument, favours the middle classes. </p> <p>Effortlessly proving the point is Goldie, who, excepting an awkward altercation with Mozart last week, has cruised up through the ranks of Maestro. Hardly surprising. He is a music producer and DJ. He juggles rhythms for a living. And he does it live, interweaving tunes seamlessly to work a club crowd into a frenzy. He is already a conductor, which is why he will probably win the competition. </p> <p>For the final, the BBC has succumbed to the tyranny of the genre and given the public the decisive vote. It is a shame. The appeal of Maestro has not come from a popularity contest, but from watching talent mature into expertise. It has also injected new drama into the hackneyed classical repertoire. There is a tension in watching an apprentice conductor grapple with a familiar orchestral tune - a fear that he or she will balls it up - that makes you listen afresh. You can hear 'O Sole Mio' and, for once, not think of Cornettos. That is a real public service.</p>",
  "<p>Bravo to Lily Allen for telling Elton John to 'F-off' while they were co-hosting the GQ awards. She seems to be regretting it (her Facebook page says she's 'dying inside'), but it sounds hilarious: Lily guzzling champagne and swearing while announcing winners; Elton becoming increasingly angry about her alcohol consumption, taking her aside for stern words before finally making a waspish comment in front of the audience.</p> <p>At which point, Lily said: 'Fuck off, Elton, I am 40 years younger than you and have my whole life ahead of me.' Elton spluttered back: 'I could still snort you under the table.' A fine riposte, but it was too late - the former coke/sex/whatever fiend turned self-styled saviour of celebrity souls had finally and most unambiguously been told where to get off. And with all due respect Mr John, not before time.</p> <p>Admittedly, Lily, who says she and Elton are friends, didn't exhibit the classiest of behaviour, but who does when they're roaring drunk and 23? Anyway, she made a good point. What is Elton if not a prime example of a group I've long identified as Born Again Prims? It's fine for them to misspend their youths in a blizzard of sex, cocaine and debauchery. However, after they've hit middle age and 'reformed', they seemingly dedicate their lives to trying to stop other, mainly younger, people enjoying their own wild years.</p> <p>It wouldn't matter so much, but Elton, a musical hero of mine, has form. George Michael found himself described by Elton as 'in a strange place [with] a deep-rooted unhappiness in his life' in the respected psychiatric publication Heat magazine. Robbie Williams has told of how 'weird' it felt to be frogmarched to rehab by Elton. Donatella Versace, Pete Doherty and Rufus Wainwright are all alleged recipients of what appears to be the Elton John Rehab Pyramid Scheme.</p> <p>One has to ask: who do Elton John and his husband David Furnish think they are, mooching about 'saving' people? It's as if they've become the Jehovah's Witnesses of celebrity sobriety, with everyone scared to open the door to them in case they get a fat lecture and a 12-step pamphlet. Imagine how a decadent celebrity's heart might plummet when they see that pair coming round the corner with their Holland &amp; Barrett bags of multivitamins. They probably hide behind the sofa, thinking: 'I've spent all my money on drugs, my career is over, my nose has gone all Danielle Westbrook, but I really must have hit rock bottom if Elton and David want to help.'</p> <p>Elton is not the only one. Most famously, Madonna has been much given in recent years to opining that daughter Lourdes will not be watching TV, eating ice cream or dating boys before the age of 18. Such moral rigidity, from a woman who once simulated masturbation onstage as a choreographed part of her act and cavorted with her front botty hanging out in the hilarious, much underrated book, Sex</p> <p>It doesn't have to be this way. Rock band Aerosmith were, if anything, wilder than Elton, but are clean living these days, with group members looking as if they're only held together by very weak Sellotape. They don't nag younger stars about sobriety and rehab programmes, but unfortunately they may be the exception.</p> <p>The only thing more boring than yet another picture of a 'tired and emotional' Amy Winehouse staggering about in a stained bra and pants buying ice pops at 4.30 in the morning is the thought of the tedious interviews she may give when she finally gets clean, droning away in fluent 'Californian' about 'finding herself, accepting she has a problem, blah blah. I want to warn all young people about the dangers of drugs, alcohol and having hair like a giant backcombed merkin'. The point is that maybe they don't want, or need, to be warned.</p> <p>Even five years ago, I was thinking there simply can't be a young person in Britain today, in the entertainment industry or otherwise, so thick as to think 'copious amounts of alcohol and class A drugs are a good and healthy choice for me'. Therefore, in 2008, surely any attempt to educate, change or indeed bombard them with censure, disdain and unasked-for advice at an awards ceremony would surely be the height of pointlessness.</p> <p>This is the great unwritten law of hedonism: listen to yourself, because only you will recognise the moment when you've had that magical amount 'enough'. The rest is just premature middle age forced upon you by elders who, with their pasts, shouldn't be throwing GQ awards in glasshouses. Lily was right the first time - Elton has had his fun, now it's her turn and, from where I'm sitting, she's a damn sight better behaved than he used to be.</p> <h2>If your lower limbs are beginning to wither and you're becoming dangerously obese, blame Google</h2> <p>Considering that Google is now 10 years old, how come we don't all hate it? Used by 70 per cent of browsers, worth \u00a375bn, Google seems to have somehow sidestepped the automatic global brand hatred of, say, a Microsoft or McDonald's. </p> <p>Simple, free, reliable, with adverts subtle enough not to drive you potty, Google is not only a design classic of web technology, but it appears to be our search engine friend. Why, then, do I suspect that it wants to rewire my brain and then eat it?</p> <p>It's not that there's anything bad or inefficient about Google; on the contrary, it might be too good. The better it gets, the more I seem to turn into a spoon-fed idiot who couldn't survive in the real world. As it is, I can't do much without using Google any more. I've noticed this before: whether it is finding a restaurant, sourcing products or fact-checking, I'm either Googling or I'm lost. </p> <p>This can't be healthy. Talking of which, I'm starting to wonder if Google may be guiltier than McDonald's of aggravating global obesity. On the one hand, a Big Mac with fries; on the other, barely having to move a muscle while doing things that used to entail days of sweaty exertion. I've just been organising my daughter's birthday party and all I've done is Google internet sites and - ooh, the effort - reach for a bankcard. </p> <p>Did I used to be this lazy? Well, yes, but only when I could get away with it. Now, because of Google, I nearly always get away with it. </p> <p>Indeed, I've got a terrible fear that one day I'll get off my chair and just fall to the floor, because my legs will have been rendered evolutionarily unnecessary for my ultra-sedentary Google lifestyle. They'll wither and, in their place, I'll grow two giant forefingers with which to type 'Google', and a flesh version of one of those festival hats with cans and straws. My corpse will be found in years to come, stuck fast to the keyboard, my eyes open, screaming their own terrible story. </p> <p>Is this Google's fiendish plot, to render us all helpless and dependent, then take over the world? How can we stop them? By Googling 'How to stop Google'? This needs earnestly debating before the next 10 years are up. Where's that nice David Icke when you need him?</p> <h2>Apparently, it's not in their jeans, it's in their genes</h2> <p>Grazia magazine ran a moving story last week about Tanya Rowe, 28, who is suffering from breast cancer and has only months to live. Tanya was trying to be strong and positive, despite her heartache at leaving behind son Charlie and fiance Jason, whom she'd just recently met, but who had asked her to be his wife despite her illness, and even offered to care for Charlie after her death. </p> <p>Last week, Grazia ran a follow up. Jason's other girlfriend had seen the article and rung Tanya. According to Tanya, Jason's reason for cheating was: 'It's been really tough on me with your illness. You've given me no emotional support.' Quite. It's all 'me, me, me' with these terminal cancer sufferers, isn't it? </p> <p>Understandably, Tanya does not want to waste the precious time she has left hating Jason, so I thought I'd do it for her. However, just as I was settling into a pleasant daydream imagining Jason being plunged headfirst into a cauldron of boiling oil, amid the flames of a karmic hell, a newspaper article caught my eye.</p> <p>According to a study by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, certain men may be genetically programmed to be unfaithful. In what has been hailed as the 'divorce gene', it's all to with some hormonal bonding thingie called vasopressin being out of synch. So, according to the study, these unfaithful men (not women strangely) are hormonally fated to cheat on their partners and seek sex elsewhere. </p> <p>The article had some other points about how genetics was never the full story (some unsubstantiated guff about how, nevertheless, there is still personal responsibility for one's actions), but I'm afraid I stopped reading there. It was all too much. I mean, Jason, if you're reading, you tell me: does male suffering never end?</p>",
  "<p>At least he is sending the rain on the just and the unjust. It rained virtually everywhere so none of the counties, in some tiny, dry pocket of the country, could steal up on their rivals as the Championship season slithers towards its climax. </p> <p>There was no play in the three First Division matches that were due to end yesterday. As a result, there were no significant changes to the league table last night. <strong>Somerset</strong> and <strong>Durham</strong>, neither of whom have ever won the Championship - though Somerset have been trying for rather longer - remain best placed to take the pennant simply because they have a game in hand over the other contenders. </p> <p>There was some activity at Canterbury in a match that ends today. Mark Ramprakash sped to his 103rd first-class century. His next task is to be unusually silky-tongued. <strong>Surrey</strong>, adrift at the bottom, desperately need a victory. So some last-day, late-season negotiations are in order to engineer a result. </p> <p>Since <strong>Kent</strong> also need a win to sustain their challenge for a trophy this season, their captain, Robert Key, will probably have an open ear. On balance, Key is in the better position to drive a hard bargain. A measure of Surrey's desperation is that they have dipped into their deep coffers and, having finally overcome visa problems, have signed Shoaib Akhtar for their last two matches. </p> <p>If the sun ever pops out again, the key fixture this week in the First Division begins at Taunton on Tuesday, where Somerset play Durham. Both sides have leant upon their overseas talent in recent years, particularly at the helm where Justin Langer and Dale Benkenstein respectively have proved to be outstanding captains. </p> <p>But it is also heartening to note the contributions of some of the Anglo- Saxons in recent matches, most notably Will Smith of Durham and Somerset's Pete Trego. To Somerset's dismay, Steve Harmison's new enthusiasm for every form of the game seems undiluted. He is the most prominent England player to be given leeway to keep playing for his county until the end of the season. </p> <p>In the Second Division, the expensive sponge that is the Lord's outfield permitted play as soon as it stopped raining yesterday, though there was not enough time for <strong>Middlesex</strong> to conjure a victory against lowly <strong>Gloucestershire</strong></p> <p>There is talk that the wonderfully lugubrious Angus Fraser might be forsaking his writing role for the Independent to become Middlesex's new director of cricket. If so, we shall miss him. I don't know who would take over his role as the Eeyore of the press box, but there are plenty of candidates. His priority would be to make Middlesex a force in a game lasting longer than 20 overs. </p> <p>Which leads us to the Stanford match. England's leading one-day players will be clutching their phones nervously on Tuesday. The squads for the surreal trip to Antigua and the rather more gruelling expedition to India for seven one-day internationals will be announced by national selector, Geoff Miller. </p> <p>Miller has insisted that the selection process will not be affected by the astonishing sums of money available to the England team if they beat the Stanford All Stars (with the dollar gaining value day by day, it must now be considerably in excess of \u00a3500,000 per man). Well, good luck to him. And surely he must consider the implications of plucking out a Graham Napier from relative obscurity and ditching a regular such as Ian Bell. </p> <p>The selectors have decided to delay picking the Test squad for India until 29 September, the day after the season has come to an end. This gives Michael Vaughan, in particular, a chance to remind us of how he used to play before he was encumbered by the captaincy. </p> <p>However, the central contracts will be announced on Tuesday. It would be overly sentimental if we were to see the names of two recent stalwarts among the centrally contracted, Vaughan and Matthew Hoggard. So fresh problems for Yorkshire's treasurer. Assuming the club wishes to keep both men on the books, their wage bill is about to rocket.</p>",
  "<p>Stand-alone insurance against airlines going bankrupt will be available to the British public for the first time next week.</p> <p>International Passenger Protection, a company that offers financial failure insurances to the travel industry, will be offering consumers cover - from \u00a35 for 30-day protection - via its website, <a href=\"http://www.protectmyholiday.com\">protectmyholiday.com</a>. The insurance will cover the cost of the defunct flight if an airline goes into administration before the policyholder's holiday starts, or the cost of replacement flights with another airline if it goes bust after departure. </p> <p>An estimated 40,000 passengers are out of pocket after the collapse of low-cost transatlantic airline Zoom 10 days ago. Its founders, John and Hugh Boyle, urged passengers to claim compensation from travel agents, insurance companies and credit card protection schemes. Yet many people did not buy their flights from travel agents and so have no protection, while only around one in 10 travel insurance policies offers protection for an airline collapsing. </p> <p>Paying by credit card offers some protection, but will only cover the value of the ticket if it is over \u00a3100; extra costs such as replacement flights or hotels are not covered. </p> <p>Twenty-four airlines have already collapsed this year and financial analysts warn Zoom is unlikely to be the last. The airline's founders blamed 'the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate', factors affecting every other airline. </p> <p>'It's inevitable more airlines will fail, especially with fuel prices as they are and the number of new carriers competing for business,' says James Freemantle, industry affairs manager at the Airport Transport Users Council. 'It's more pressing than ever for the government to look at passing legislation protecting people from airlines going bust.' </p> <p>So what can you do to protect yourself from a travel disaster? </p> <p><strong>On a package holiday</strong></p> <p>You are unlikely to need to take any extra measures against airline collapse. The Civil Aviation Authority runs a scheme called Atol that provides financial protection for those buying their flight as part of a package, even if they have only put down a deposit. See <a href=\"http://www.atol.org.uk\">www.atol.org.uk</a>.</p> <p><strong>Buying flights only </strong></p> <p>Confusing rules apply, leading many wrongly to think they are covered. If you buy your ticket directly from an airline, your money isn't protected if that airline fails. If you buy from a travel agent and get your ticket within 24 hours, your money is also not protected. But if the agent takes longer than this to get you your ticket it must provide you with a document either showing that it has arranged airline failure insurance and has added this cost to the fare - typically about \u00a33 - or that it hasn't arranged any cover and you are not protected. </p> <p><strong>Travel insurance</strong></p> <p>Many people imagine, again wrongly, that they are covered by their travel insurance policy in the event of an airline collapse. In reality, few insurers include airline failure insurance in their cover because it adds to the premium and makes them appear less competitive. The Post Office is one of the few to include the cover as standard in its annual policies. It offers up to \u00a31,500 cover, but its travel insurance policies are not the cheapest. For annual worldwide cover for someone under 65 it charges \u00a367.50. This compares unfavourably with Swiftcover, which offers \u00a33,000 of airline failure insurance as an add-on to its policy at the cost of \u00a31 for single trip insurance and \u00a33 for an annual policy. Its annual policy for the same person works out at \u00a345 with airline failure cover. </p> <p>A survey of 10 providers by price comparison website Gocompare.com found only one, Travelplan Direct, that covered airline failure; its premium for the same person is \u00a342. </p> <p>'If you're not covered by the Atol protection scheme, it's worthwhile weighing up what the chances are of your airline having financial problems,' says Hayley Parsons of Gocompare.com. 'If you're flying with an airline such as British Airways it's highly unlikely you'll have any worries, but if you've booked with a smaller and perhaps less well-established airline then the extra protection of airline failure cover could be worth it.'</p> <p>If the airline goes bust before you fly, the policies cover travel and accommodation costs paid in advance, as long as they do not form part of an inclusive holiday. After departure, the policies cover the cost of replacing the original flights with similar ones from another airline, or if cutting the holiday short is unavoidable, the cost of earlier return flights to the UK. The flights must have been booked through a bonded travel agent or direct with a scheduled airline for the policy to be valid. </p> <p>At \u00a35 per policy for 30 days, and an extra \u00a31 per person covered thereafter, the International Passenger Protection policy is more expensive than other ways of obtaining airline failure insurance. However, its flexibility lies in that it can be purchased separately. </p> <p>Always check whether the policy excludes any airlines; IPP, for example, stopped covering Zoom a couple of months before the airline went bankrupt because there were warning signs over the carrier's financial health. </p> <p><strong>If you are paying by debit card</strong></p> <p>Debit card transactions are not covered by credit card legislation, but Martin Lewis of consumer revenge website Moneysavingexpert.com points out a little-known scheme Visa debit card holders can use - many customers of collapsed hamper company Fairpak used it - called Visa debit 'chargeback'.</p> <p>If you pay for something and that order or service has not been adequately completed or is never received, your bank can charge back its value from the retailer's bank. Call your bank with airline payment details and ask to start the chargeback procedure on basis of non-delivery of the goods. Bank staff may not have heard of chargeback, but stand your ground and complain if they continue to ignore your claim.</p>",
  "<p>A traditional Japanese welcome requires grace, poise and balance. Sadly I lack all three. Just five minutes after kneeling on Houshi's woven tatami (rush) mat floor the cramp sets in and I'm swaying wildly. Yet my kimono-clad companion approaches carrying green tea in one hand, delicate sweets in the other and still manages to drop into an elegant nose-to-the-floor bow. I am seriously impressed. </p> <p>Of course Houshi has had time to hone its welcome ceremony. This is a family-owned hotel that has thrived for 46 consecutive generations. I've come to Awazu Onsen, four hours north west of Tokyo in Japan's Ishikawa region to discover what 'more than a millennium of experience' means for guests.</p> <p>My reception is seamless. After arriving to beaming smiles and deep bows, my boots are swapped for slippers and I'm led into a bright room for a tea ceremony. On one side, full-height windows reveal a peaceful water garden; on the other, vibrant blue walls are decorated with delicate flowers and bold calligraphy. My elegant attendant is Ami, five foot of pink kimono and white tabi-socked feet. She's my nakai-san, the personal assistant assigned to make sure my stay is as enjoyable as possible. Ryokan, the traditional upmarket Japanese hotels, are often run on strict rules and timetables, but here the guest's wishes come first. Nothing, I'm assured, is too much trouble. </p> <p>With 100 bedrooms, Houshi is larger than it looks. While sadly none of the original building has survived, internally the rooms are like stepping back in time. Behind my shoji (paper screen) doors I find a simple space of cream walls and tatami floors. </p> <p>There's no bed, just a low lacquered table with zaisu (legless chairs) and plush cushions. In the alcove an ikebana flower arrangement is placed beneath a picture of bluebirds. Through a second set of shoji, glass doors lead directly into an ancient mossy garden, all pines and pagodas, gentle flowing streams and koi carp ponds. </p> <p>Inside the 400-year-old garden, I glimpse Enmeikaku, a lovely free standing wooden structure half-hidden in the greenery. Built for the wedding of Houshi's 19th-century owners, it's a collection of beautifully decorated rooms, verandas and cedar-wood baths. </p> <p>Being surrounded by the achievement of your ancestors must be both a comfort and a source of pressure I suggest to the current Mr Houshi. 'Yes, to keep the traditions alive is a big responsibility,' he agrees, showing an endearing mixture of familial pride and Japanese modesty. </p> <p>'It is like a marathon, I run with my employees and clients to pass this baton to the next generation.'</p> <p>The ryokan's endurance hasn't relied on passing down a prescriptive rulebook from parent to child. Instead each son is taught the simple proverb 'learn from water and study yourself'. That's it? 'But it means a lot. Water is dynamic, has power and doesn't hesitate to enter dirty places and clean.

In 717 Buddhist priest Taicho Daishi was hiking Mount Hakusan when one night a mountain deity appeared in his dream. It revealed the existence of a hidden hot spring in nearby Awazu village, mineral water that could heal sickness. Taicho instructed his guide, Garyo Houshi, to build an inn there and the rest is history. This all bodes well. I've visited many of Japan's onsen (hot springs where people go to bathe) but never one discovered by divine providence. And as an added incentive, bathing in and drinking the famous water is believed to have magical powers, helping to banish a long list of ailments. At a remarkably sprightly 69, Mr Houshi is a walking advert for the regime. After a sip from the stone fountain and a soak in both the indoor bath and outdoor rotenburo I certainly feel renewed.</p> <p>Toasty warm and back in my casual yukata kimono I'm ready for my 12- course kaiseki feast, which appears in my room dish-by-dish in the hands of Ami. After the beautifully presented sashimi and sesame tofu, bamboo and beef, I slip on my wooden clogs and take an evening stroll through the garden. </p> <p>Wandering between the mossy stones I consider Mr Houshi's passion for his guests. Generations of families return here, drawn by the attention to detail and genuine warmth of service (he often writes poems to his guests inspired by their names). The staff seem to understand that the simplest pleasures, food, bath and rest, can add up to something very special. Or as Mr Houshi put it: 'One day here is such a short time compared to their whole lives. I want that day to be very valuable.' </p> <p>Drifting off to sleep in my futon I have faith in his prediction that the ryokan will still stand in 1,300 more years. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> A room at Houshi (<a href=\"http://www.ho-shi.co.jp/jiten/Houshi_E/home.htm\">www.ho-shi.co.jp/jiten/Houshi_E/home.htm</a>), with dinner and breakfast costs from \u00a3102 per person; The hotel can be reached from Tokyo in four hours.

  "<p>Muscat is a great and ramified family of vine varieties, which are unusual in that they produce wines that actually smell and taste of grapes. Muscat vines tend to thrive in hot climates and the grapes come in many colours, from greenish yellow through pink to dark brown, but almost all of them produce wine that was white at least in its youth (the dark-skinned black muscat, or muscat of Hamburg, is an exception). They have historically made rich, heady dessert wines, but are increasingly being made into dry(ish) table wines in the style of muscat d'Alsace.</p> <p>The finest, most ancient muscat vine is small-berried and usually light-skinned, called muscat blanc \u00e0 petits grains. This is responsible for France's most distinguished vins doux naturels (sweet wines) - muscat de Beaumes de Venise, muscat de St Jean de Minervois, muscat de Frontignan, muscat de Lunel and the more obscure muscat de Mireval. Its wines often hint at orange flowers and spice. </p> <p>This variety is grown all over central and eastern Europe, and is responsible for Greece's rich tradition of muscats and, as moscato, for north-west Italy's spumante industry. In South Africa, it is known as muskadel. </p> <p>Muscat of Alexandria makes much less distinguished wine - marmalade rather than orange blossom is a useful shorthand - although Portugal's moscatel of Setubal and its dry counterparts can be interesting. Carefully vinified, muscat can provide useful blending material, particularly for medium-dry blends, and is widely grown for Rivesaltes in Roussillon. Any Spanish wine called simply moscatel is likely to be made from this variety, and moscatels from ancient vines around Malaga can be extremely fine.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Nivole Moscato d'Asti Michele Chiarlo 2007, Italy</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.99 for 37.5cl, Booths; \u00a36.99 for 37.5cl, Oddbins</strong></p> <p>Just effervescent, sweet but not cloying, and at 5%, blissfully low in alcohol, this delicately peachy wine is one to pour into large glasses and sip on a weekend afternoon.

  "<p>Bill Browder, the chairman of Hermitage Capital, presents a document which he says shows the involvement of 'a group of criminals at a reasonably high level in the Russian government' in the theft of $230m (\u00a3131m) from the Russian tax ministry. It is entitled: 'Persecution of Hermitage in Russia in order to steal $230m from the Russian people.' Browder is a man who manages money in one part of his life, and in another is on a mission to cleanse Russia of its criminal class. He speaks with a zeal rarely found among financiers. </p> <p>'I believe very strongly that Russian people shouldn't be subjected to this kind of thing. It is unfortunate that a lot of very nice people in Russia have to live in fear of being arrested in the middle of the night, having their assets taken away from them, or being murdered.' </p> <p>He cannot overstate the dire state of business practice and ethics. 'It is bent at every turn in the story. It is a chaotic and horrific story about business in Russia.' </p> <p>The treatment of his lawyers confirms Browder's view that business conditions in Russia have retreated to the state he found when he set up his firm in 1992, with the assistance of money from the late banker Edmond Safra. He was extremely successful over the following 15 years. His $4bn portfolio of Russian stocks made him the largest foreign investor in the country. </p> <p>The key to his success was attacking Russian companies with poor corporate governance and seeing the stock price rise as they improved their management and ethics. This approach upset senior members of the political and economic elite and in 2005 Browder's entry visa was withdrawn. </p> <p>He mounted a crusade at the highest levels to seek its return, even approaching Dmitry Medvedev, the man destined to be the president of Russia, at Davos last year.</p> <p>Browder recalls: 'I saw him finishing his dessert. He was sitting on his own. I saw this as an interesting opportunity to have a chat with him and so I went over to talk to him. He stood up. We knew each other. I had worked with him because he was the chairman of Gazprom and I had always been very active in Gazprom. We had a very cordial relationship. I asked him if he could get my visa reinstated. He knew all about me. He said yes, he would help me. He asked me for a copy of the visa application and I got my office to produce one and I got it to him the next morning.'</p> <p>Ironically, this approach to Medvedev appears to have triggered a massive scam on Russia's finance ministry. Browder's office in London received a call from a lieutenant-colonel in the interior ministry a month after the Medvedev meeting with what he can only construe as a request for a bribe. </p> <p>Hermitage has a recording of the conversation, where the speaker refers to Browder's request to Medvedev about his visa. The speaker asks if he can contact Browder. He says: 'The sooner we meet and you provide what is necessary, the sooner your problems will disappear.'</p> <p>Browder says that every company in Russia 'receives requests like this on a regular basis. People try to shake you down all over Russia. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred if you ignore it, nothing happens. This was the one case out of a hundred when something happened.'</p> <p>Hermitage's lawyers were raided by police from the interior ministry three months later, and their computers, servers and files containing information were removed. One young lawyer tried to intervene and was beaten up. The homes of other lawyers working for Hermitage were raided at around the same time. </p> <p>This gave members of the interior ministry the means to steal Hermitage's identity. So when a company unknown to Browder alleged that Hermitage had reneged on a sale of Gazprom shares and owed $376m, Browder was helpless to resist it. Officials from the interior ministry had apparently used the lawyers' documents to remove the legitimate managers and replace them with their own cronies. Hermitage companies were deemed to owe $1.26bn.</p> <p>The plan was stopped dead in its tracks after the perpetrators realised that Browder had removed all the assets. 'It was a well-engineered scam with one big fault. About three months after I got kicked out of Russia, we moved all the assets out of Russia. There was nothing there. So we felt reasonably comfortable. You can win as many fake claims as you want, but if there are no assets, there is nothing to steal from us.' </p> <p>The scam had another leg. The crooks used alleged liabilities created by it to extract from the Russian government $230m worth of tax paid a year earlier by Hermitage. Browder said: 'They created fake losses exactly equal to that to create a new net profit of zero. We paid $230m of taxes and they filed amended tax returns and asked for the money back. They have losses that correspond to the profits.' Browder believes that $230m has been pocketed by the crooks. </p> <p>The scam has yet to run its course. Browder tells how a package, packed with sensitive documents, was sent by the courier company DHL from London to the offices of Hermitage's Moscow lawyers. The return address on the back of the envelope was given as the Hermitage offices in Soho but the name on the address had been made up. </p> <p>An investigation found that the name was that of someone whose passport had been stolen. 'We didn't send the package. Two eastern European-looking gentlemen paid cash to DHL at the Lambeth depot [in South London]. They were captured on closed-circuit television.' Two hours after the package arrived at the lawyers' offices, Russian police raided the premises and took away the package. </p> <p>Mere coincidence? Not so, says Browder, for whom this was merely another piece of evidence that he was targeted by a well-organised gang. 'The obvious intention is to create a trail from us to our lawyers. This stuff was going to be used to blame us and to blame our lawyers. They steal the money and they try to blame us.' </p> <p>The attack on Hermitage has persuaded Browder to revise his trenchant views on Russia's oligarchs over their mistreatment of shareholders. </p> <p>'I was critical of Mikhail Khodorkovsky [the jailed Russian oligarch] because he mistreated minority shareholders when he controlled Yukos and we were a shareholder in his subsidiaries. I now have a lot of sympathy for him. I was a target of his behaviour. Now I'm a victim in this absurd situation. I sympathise with him. I think he has had a bum deal. He has paid any dues he could ever possibly pay for anything that he did a long time ago. I think he should be let out and I very much hope he is.'</p> <p>Browder retains few hopes of returning to Russia, where he is the subject of an arrest warrant. He now travels regularly to the Gulf to manage an investment portfolio of some $2.8bn. 'It is an absolute delight to do business outside Russia. The UAE is my favourite location for doing business today.'</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Name</strong> William Browder</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> Princeton, New Jersey, 1964</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> BA (Hons), Chicago University, 1985; MBA, Stanford Graduate School of Business, 1989</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Grandfather was Earl Browder, jailed head of the Communist Party USA,1932-1945</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Moved to the UK in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall to specialise in eastern Europe.

  "<p><strong>Ben Ainslie<br>Olympic gold medallist sailor</strong></p> <h2>The best place I've sailed was...</h2> <p>Sydney Harbour. It's so beautiful and obviously in summer the weather's great, but it's challenging too because of the topography of the land and the high buildings, which create a good breeze.</p> <h2>The worst place I've sailed was...</h2> <p>A lake outside Moscow in 2005. It was part of the Russian bid to host the 2012 Olympics and we sailed in the Finn class world championships there. It was a bad place to sail - cold, wet and a small lake.</p> <h2>The last person i sat next to on a plane was...</h2> <p>Rebecca Adlington, the swimmer who won two gold medals in Beijing. We were in first class on the BA flight back from China and I'd never met her before but she was really lovely and dead excited. That flight was pretty much a party all the way as 90 per cent of the passengers were the British Olympic team and the atmosphere was fantastic.</p> <h2>I learnt to sail in...</h2> <p>Cornwall, on Restronguet Creek near where my family live. My parents still live down there and I try to go back to visit at least once a year. It's great to get away to the West Country - it has such a relaxed, laid-back atmosphere.</p> <h2>My favourite hotel is...</h2> <p>The Badrutts Palace right on the lake in St Moritz, Switzerland. I've competed in the regatta there a couple of times and been lucky enough to stay in this hotel. I think the rooms cost thousands of euros a night - fortunately we stayed for free.</p> <h2>My most memorable meal was in...</h2> <p>A small beach shack (one of only about five) on a tiny flat island called Anegada in the British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean. We sat on rickety plastic chairs on the beach and ate fresh grilled lobster with herbs and spices.</p> <h2>My favourite beach is...</h2> <p>Bondi in Sydney. I've always liked it. There's always something going on there and I love the fact that it's this great natural beach but has the city right behind it with cool restaurants and shops all along the front. There's a great atmosphere.</p> <h2>I won't go back to...</h2> <p>Moscow in a hurry. It is interesting that both Russia and China are essentially one-party states and have similar set-ups, but in China I found the local people very happy and friendly whereas everyone I met in Russia seemed depressed. The attitude of the local people can really make a massive impact on your experience of a place.</p> <h2>My top travel tip is...</h2> <p>To beat jet lag you have to be brutal with yourself. Set your watch to the new time zone as soon as you get on the plane and force yourself to either stay awake or go to sleep depending on what time it is otherwise you'll take a week to recover at the other end. On long-haul flights I always try to sleep as much as possible. I think you can get too carried away with all the in-flight entertainment.</p> <h2>I used to bring back...</h2> <p>Presents for all the family, but I'm now at the stage where I travel so much I don't really bother buying things unless I'm somewhere really special. In China I was given a number of weird little gifts by the locals, including some tiny boxes and a glass vial holding some of the seaweed that had bloomed in the sailing area just before the Olympics. They'd collected it up, put it in small glass cases and made them into necklaces!</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Ben Ainslie is a judge on the Visa travel photo competition 'Secret Summer Shot'.

  "<p>A snail could crawl along the Great Wall of China in about the same time it will take for women to have equal representation as men in Parliament at the current rate of progress, according to the latest Sex and Power survey from the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Other areas are slightly more egalitarian: the snail would only have to go from Land's End to John o'Groats and halfway back to find women equally represented among FTSE 100 companies. </p> <p>But one industry appears to be bucking the trend: fund management. In the past few months, Katherine Garrett-Cox has been appointed chief executive of Dundee-based Alliance Trust while Ruth Keattch is joining investment boutique Artemis as a fund manager in its small and mid-cap team. They join a growing band of women in senior positions in the industry.</p> <p>Nicola Horlick, founder of Bramdean Asset Management, is perhaps the most high profile, but others include Helena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton Investment Management; Jane Platt, chief executive of National Savings and Investments; Sarah Arkle, chief investment officer at Threadneedle; Anne Richards, who holds the same position at Aberdeen Asset Management; Karen Prooth, who heads the European ishares business at Barclays Global Investors; Nichola Pease, chief executive of JO Hambro Capital Management... the list goes on.</p> <p>'It's very easy to measure how good a fund manager is,' says Arkle. 'We all live and breath by the performance tables so it is possibly easier to be completely unbiased [about gender] as you are being measured every minute of your life.'</p> <p>It is also a more predictable life: while investment bankers, lawyers or accountants may end up having to work through the night when a big assignment arrives, fund management is rarely that demanding. Harriett Baldwin, who has just retired after 23 years working for JP Morgan Asset Management, says: 'When my son was very young, I could say, \"I know I need to be in California for a board meeting on that date\", and have it scheduled in advance. That is not the case in investment banking, where you are not able to plan ahead.'</p> <p>While keeping up with the research and reports is time-consuming, it can be done at home: many male fund managers admit to scouring the FT after putting the children to bed. 'The BlackBerry has revolutionised things,' says Baldwin. But she thinks the number of women in the industry is still 'woefully low', something she was trying to address while at JP Morgan by hosting events at universities and sixth-form colleges, promoting it as a family-friendly career, as well as by running women's support networks and mentoring systems to encourage those already in the firm. There was some success: recruitment at graduate level was evenly split between men and women, despite the fact that fewer than 30 per cent of applicants were female.</p> <p>There are many talented female fund managers commanding good places in the performance league tables, such as Rosemary Banyard at Schroders, Elena Shaftan at Jupiter, Karen Robertson at Standard Life and Fatima Luis at F&amp;C. But, as in other professions, women are in the minority. While there are no formal statistics about the split between male and female fund managers, a survey by Citywire showed that just 10 per cent of those it rates are women. </p> <p>But there is some evidence that things are improving. Michele Turner, who specialises in fund management placements for executive search agency Hanson Green, says that five years ago just 7.5 per cent of the executives targeted as potential candidates were women; now the figure is 20 per cent while, among those actually placed, the rise is even steeper from 4 per cent in 2003 to 20 per cent over the past year.</p> <p>She thinks that could still understate the position as women executives can be more loyal to their existing employers, often because they have arrangements such as flexible or part-time working.</p> <p>If the lifestyle of some of the senior women is anything to go by, fund management is certainly more family friendly: indeed, a large brood almost looks like a qualification for a senior job. Morrissey leads the charge with eight children, but Horlick has five of her own - a sixth died of leukaemia - while her second husband has a further three; Garrett-Cox has four and Pease has three.</p> <p>Morrissey says that fund management can more easily be combined with having a family than some other careers. 'You are measured by performance rather than hours you spend at your desk. We encourage people - men and women - to work from home to give them flexibility and space.'</p> <p>But, as she would admit, good support systems are useful too: her husband stays at home to look after the children. Abderdeen's Richards, who has twins, says: 'You have to work hard to make it work if you have a family. You need a supportive partner, whether you are a man or a woman.' Her husband works from home, making it easier to co-ordinate diaries for business trips. But she adds: 'I have a number of good friends in the City who are single or childless. I would not say they have done better or worse than those who have children.'</p> <p>She thinks that encouraging women makes good business sense: while two decades ago, they would invariably have given up when they had children, now many of Aberdeen's female managers come back part-time. 'Once their children get older, we see them increase their hours to get closer to full-time. Some of them will stay until they are 60. If we can keep them, that is fantastic.'</p> <p>Arkle thinks that could be facilitated by the way fund management companies are structured. 'There is a very flat structure. Once you start in a fund management business, by and large you will be doing the same thing you were doing in your late twenties.' Success will bring more money in from investors and new funds to manage, increasing the challenges. 'You can have a really good name without ever having to leave or manage lots of people. So the glass ceiling is perhaps not as important.' </p> <p>The performance ethos can, however, also work against women. Horlick's career has included spells at Deutsche Bank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and she says: 'When I ran big fund managers, I recruited an equal number of women and men, but most of the women went off to do other things.' She attributes that to the fact that 'a lot of women do not like to be constantly measured, they find it very stressful'.</p> <p>Morrissey says that will partly depend on the ethos of the firm: 'It is clearly very pressurised but we have a team approach, which is not quite so stressful. Women are generally quite conscientious and, if they have done all the hard work but get it wrong because of extraneous circumstances [like the movement of the market], it can be very frustrating.'</p> <p>A good fund management performance can be a step up to more general responsibilities, as the promotion to chief executive of Morrissey and Garrett-Cox has shown. </p> <p>Platt, who has that role in National Savings, says: 'In my time as a fund manager I spent a lot of time analysing companies, how they were doing and why some were doing well and some badly. I became mesmerised by the question of strategic management and direction which convinced me to leap across. But you have to convince someone you can make that leap across in practice.'</p> <p>One thing that frustrates all high-profile women is the amount of attention their gender brings. Garrett-Cox has earned the rather predictable sobriquet Katherine the Great, Horlick is known as Superwoman, while Carol Galley, one of the first top female fund managers when she was at Mercury Asset Management, was dubbed the Ice Maiden.</p> <p>Plenty of men in similar positions have comparable idiosyncrasies - New Star's John Duffield always eats in the same restaurant and wears the same Marks &amp; Spencer jumpers; Aberdeen's Martin Gilbert is usually glued to his BlackBerry - but they do not attract the same interest, nor do they have such patronising nicknames. </p> <p>Some now shun the limelight to avoid encouraging yet more clich\u00e9d coverage, but Morrissey says: 'I hate the superwoman tag but it does show people that it can be done if you want to do it. That is one of the advantages.'</p>",
  "<p>So you've seen Sideways, yes? The film featuring Miles and Jack ambling through mid-life crises and Californian vineyards \"in search of wine and in search of themselves\". And you might also remember The Darling Buds of May, in which strait-laced taxman Charley was lured into the bucolic postwar Kentish idyll of the Larkin family - and more particularly into the arms of the young Catherine Zeta-Jones - via a few bottles of local hooch. Great stories, set 6,000 miles and half a century apart, yet, in a manner of speaking, you can have a walk-on part in both just an hour's drive from London.</p> <p>Let's start in Larkin territory. Not far from Pluckley in Kent, where the TV series was filmed, is Biddenden. These vineyards were founded in 1969 when, in what might have been a Darling Buds plotline, the mother of current owner Julian Barnes (no, not that one) heard an item about wine on Woman's Hour and persuaded her husband to give over a few acres of their apple orchards to vine. Wine might have been produced in England since before the Norman conquest, but this was the ground floor of the modern English wine industry and Biddenden reflects where it came from and, just maybe, where it's heading.</p> <p>Biddenden still specialises in the ortega grape, which produces fruitily off-dry Germanic-style wine, which is presented in bottles with gothic script on the labels. The longstanding lack of interest from the wine trade in this style means that 80% of this wine is sold at the farm gate. But Biddenden is adapting to modern tastes. It has retained some orchard and produces increasingly sought-after apple juice as well as cider. The vineyards - quite spectacularly beautiful - attract 30,000 visitors a year, who can walk among the vines as well as taste the products at the farm shop. There is even a self-catering converted loft - complete with incongruously hi-tech flat screen TV - where guests can stay. But perhaps most interesting is that Biddenden has begun to introduce the more fashionable French variety grapes, and sparkling wine and light pinot noir are coming on stream. \"You work with what you've got,\" explains Barnes. \"But that doesn't mean you can't change things as you go along.\"</p> <p>If David Jason as Pop Larkin might have raised an eyebrow at the advances at Biddenden, he would have apoplexy at Chapel Down. This stock market listed company (<a href=\"http://www.englishwinesgroup.com\">englishwinesgroup.com</a>) sees itself very much as the future, and its approach has been more revolution than evolution. It has made a commitment to French varietal grapes - in particular the champagne holy trinity of pinot noir, chardonnay and pinot meunier - and has approached the problem of high prices and variable quality of English wines by going unashamedly upmarket. Chapel Down was the first English winemaker to win a gold medal at the International Wine Challenge, it supplies Gordon Ramsay and Gary Rhodes restaurants, the Dorchester and Mandarin Oriental hotels, and it exports. Just like the state-of-the-art California wineries visited by Miles and Jack in Sideways - and as is the norm in other wine tourist hotspots round the world - Chapel Down also boasts a newly opened high-quality restaurant.</p> <p>A visit can range from some fairly lavish all-day corporate entertainment to wandering round the vineyard and tasting the entire range of wines for free. There are plenty of other options in between - comparative tasting of identical wine aged in either French or American oak barrels is a particularly enlightening part of one tour - and this combination of high-quality product and visitor access appears to be the new model for the English wine industry. A few miles away at the Gusbourne Estate, one of the many new vineyards cropping up all over England and Wales, they have been planting vines since 2004, but won't have any wine (sparkling only, competing directly with some of the best-known Champagnes) until 2009. But already the vineyards are picture-book pretty, with a rose bush bookending every line of vines, and a visitor and tasting centre will be ready as soon as the wines are.</p> <p>Looking out over the Gusborne vines to the newly constructed windfarm dominating the skyline over Romney marsh, you might be reminded that everything changes. The Darling Buds of May landscape is now inhabited by Sideways viticulture and increasingly sophisticated wine culture. But in a sense, that's nothing new. An ice age or two ago, Kent and Champagne were part of the same landmass. And, as the winemakers enthusiastically point out, every one degree of global warming pushes the \"wine-growing envelope\" 200km north. So raise a glass of English sparkling now, and maybe prepare your grandchildren for the possibility of a glass of English claret.</p> <h2>Vineyards to visit</h2> <p><strong>Camel Valley</strong></p> <p>Bodmin, Cornwall</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.camelvalley.com\">camelvalley.com</a></p> <p>Makes sparkling wine using the traditional methode champenoise, and offers a range of tours: we like the sound of the grand tour and tasting.</p> <p><strong>Sharpham</strong></p> <p>Totnes, Devon</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sharpham.com\">sharpham.com</a></p> <p>A vineyard and winery in a stunning location above the River Dart.

With cycle touring now a popular pastime in the vineyards of Napa Valley, Australia and France, I decided it was time to try it here. </p> <p>The first stop, Bookers, is a small winery in Bolney. It wasn't a great start.

It also has a cellar, with its own lift, capable of holding 250,000 bottles. Our tasting, by contrast, was three thimble-sized nips of wine. A pint was in order, so the next stop was a pub near the foot of Ditchling Beacon, a favourite hill for cyclists to test their legs. </p> <p>Breaky Bottom, not far from Lewes, made all the hills worth it. Even the sun came out. Peter Hall, the winemaker there, served up a lip-puckeringly crisp 2003 Cuv\u00e9e Alex Mercier (named after Hall's French grandfather). </p> <p>Hall planted his vines in 1974 and has been battling away in the valley ever since, overcoming floods, hungry snails, cold summers and the realities of small-scale production in an industry that thrives on economies of scale and vertical integration. He joked that the lift to the cellar at Ridgeview cost as much as his entire operation. </p> <p>Freewheeling into Newhaven to catch the train back, we had covered around 30 miles, through rain, bumpy lanes and A-roads full of angry motorists, for five small tastes of wine - seeing the ferry about to depart for Dieppe, I couldn't help thinking it would be a bit easier in the sunny cyclist's paradise across the channel. But then again, where would be the challenge in that?</p>",
  "<p>If you walk the length of the diplodocus in Alfred Waterhouse's still extraordinary Victorian entrance hall to the Natural History Museum and then follow the curve of its tail you will soon be faced with a comparable surprise: the largest cocoon ever made by man. The cocoon, which has grown quietly in west London since it was first conceived in 2001, will be revealed at the beginning of 2009, in time for Darwin's 200th birthday - 60m long, and eight storeys high, bulging within a huge glass box.</p> <p>Last month I was standing in the shadow of the concrete cocoon with Anna Maria Indrio. Indrio, an Italian, is a partner in the Danish architectural practice CF M\u00f8ller, which has designed the new Darwin extension to the museum. She is herself a force of nature, full of proprietory excitement at her creation: 'Most of all we wanted,' she says, 'to create a skin, a shell for all this fantastic treasure!'</p> <p>The cocoon will house not one insect but 17m of them, all carefully filed and annotated (along with 3m flowering plant specimens) - but it is not just this unparalleled archive that will be stored together for the first time. In the heart of the new building the Natural History Museum will also be putting its greatest living wonders on show: its staff of 220 scientists will be presented in full view of the public.</p> <p>At intervals, along the winding descent through the dramatic cocoon, these rare creatures will be viewed behind glass at their work stations, preparing petri-dishes, peering through microscopes, eating lunch, perhaps grabbing an afternoon nap. At various points the public will have the opportunity to interact directly with them, to ask questions and to examine experiments. </p> <p>The museum believes this initiative will radically change the way it is perceived - that it will shift overnight in the popular imagination from being a home to fabulous old bones to being seen as a living and breathing organism. 'It has sometimes seemed an introverted space,' director of science Richard Lane tells me. 'Now the place will be an extrovert suddenly; there will be a new openness about what we do.'</p> <p>To get a sense of what this new openness might mean I sought out various curators in their corners of the current building, which has, over the last century, spawned its own intricate ecosystem. The scientists are squirrelled away, in Victorian rooms that smell sharply of naphthalene, behind vast oak doors. Labs and desks have grown among the crevices and nooks of 7.5km of mahogany drawers. The beetle men are separated from the botanists, and the botanists can be quietly sniffy about the flashy lepidopterists.</p> <p>Wandering the corridors of this place, within which the vast cocoon is taking shape, I occasionally catch the uncanny atmosphere of David Cronenburg's The Fly, or of Kafka's Metamorphosis. There is no building in London that makes you feel more a human animal than this one. I've always envied the neurologist Oliver Sacks's account of hiding in the Natural History Museum as a boy and spending the night among dinosaur bones: 'Even familiar animals became fearful, uncanny, as I prowled that night,' he recalled, 40 years later, 'their faces suddenly looming out of the darkness or hovering ghostlike at the periphery of the flashlight. The museum, lightless, was a place of delirium, and I was not wholly sorry when morning came ...'</p> <p>Though there is much that is dead in the museum, the scientists are what alchemise it into life. I come across Mark Spencer, curator of plants, floppy haired and T-shirted in the museum's inner sanctum, its holy of holies, the Sloane Herbarium, where all of this began. Hans Sloane, royal physician of the 17th century, bequeathed the first 5,000 specimens to the collection, which prompted Linnaeus to invent his classification system and, with it, botany. Spencer pulls down a leather-bound volume from the stacks around the walls and opens it at random. Pressed and labelled in a neat inked hand is a lilac specimen collected by the Reverend Adam Buddle, the original country pastor and amateur botanist, after whom Linnaeus named the butterfly bush (Buddleia).</p> <p>Spencer's eyes light up. 'We used to think,' he says, 'of British botany as something that was pretty much done and dusted, but now with climate change these books are becoming incredibly important. Among other things they offer an invaluable time series. You can mine them for flowering cycles, carbon content, density of stoma on leaves which changes according to the amount of CO2 in the air - all of that.'</p> <p>Like all the curators I meet, Spencer is clearly in the grip of something of a lifelong obsession. This is much more than a vocation. It was his 40th birthday recently, he explains, and his mum was recalling how she would lie him down on the grass as a baby and he would crawl over to the flower bed and pull off flower heads, start collecting and examining specimens. He has never stopped.</p> <p>He was a gardener at Kew, but after a PhD in fungal evolution he found himself here, in charge of 3m pressed flowers. He spent the first two years studying Linnaeus's seaweed names, finding arcane errors, putting them right. The history of nomenclature, which is one of the functions of this museum, has in part been a story of Chinese whispers, he suggests. It is expensive and embarrassing when you don't get it right. He points to a classic example recently of researchers who, having done an enormous amount of work with medicinal leeches, could not explain their weird data. It turned out, because of a spelling error, they had been using the wrong species for years.</p> <p>In order to keep the archive correct and alive Spencer relies in part on a quiet army of like-minded volunteers. The tradition of the amateur botanist, of Adam Buddle, is alive and well. 'David for example,' he gestures round the corner, where an elderly man is intent at a microscope 'is an expert on hawkweeds and he looks after those for me. There are dozens of people like him.' But still, the collection is not as open as Spencer would like it to be. 'The aim is always if a member of public says, \"I want to look at the plants in my area,\" within reason we will allow that.'</p> <p>The new Darwin cocoon will allow this interaction to go much further. In the coming years Spencer believes we will need to be ever more vigilant about the ways in which our plant life is changing and the museum hopes to enlist the public in its data collection efforts. The current bluebell project - an attempt to discover the extent of the spread of the invasive Spanish variety and the threat to our native flower - run by Spencer, is a case in point. 'Scientists can't collect all the data, but we now have thousands of people helping - and children can learn basic science by getting involved.' Bumble-bee and earthworm projects will follow.</p> <p>This public involvement might prove invaluable in the arguments about climate change, Spencer thinks. 'When the systems really start breaking down, Dutch elm disease-type events will be happening all around. In the last five years there have been profound shifts in the London area, for example. Tree of heaven would never self-set in London. It is increasingly a huge problem now because it is growing everywhere. We have avocado flowering and fruiting. Bougainvillea overwintering on King's Cross Road.'</p> <p>Life thrives on perturbation but the chaos we are going to put ourselves through in the next 50 years will be too much for many native species, Spencer believes. For the time being, though, he has more than enough to keep him happy. Does he have a favourite plant? 'The Lizard peninsula is full of amazing things,' he says. 'There's a little squitty thing called fringed rupture wort which is just like a little green mat on a rock, but it's an endlessly fascinating thing to me. A lot of science is people looking at a plant or whatever and thinking: how on earth does it do that? It is like art: why is something wondrous to people?'</p> <p>This question seems particularly challenging later that afternoon when I meet Dr Martin Hall, who has some of the more extreme insights into all creatures great and small at the museum. Hall is the country's leading forensic scientist, his speciality being the study of maggots in flesh wounds to discover the precise time of a murder.</p> <p>He is a wry and engaging figure, a man who should be a TV drama series. He greets me with a selection of fattened maggots in pots, a kind of juju necklace of maggots removed from the rear end of a sheep, and a series of graphic photographs of wounds (mostly in live animals) in which maggots are making hay. In among the photographs are a couple of pictures of his own legs and arms with livid sores.</p> <p>'I had a personal experience of some of this after I came back from Bolivia one time,' he explains matter of factly, 'along with the maggot of a botfly in my leg. They can eventually get quite large,' - he opens a 2in gap between thumb and forefinger - 'so I could feel this movement and I could see the tip of the maggot coming up to breathe and going back down.'</p> <p>What did he do?</p> <p>'Well you can't really squeeze them out, because they have these backward facing spines. You need surgery. I had a couple in my arm, too. I discovered if you put Vaseline over them they can't breathe and tend to back out of their own accord, eventually.'</p> <p>One of the numerous practical applications of the entomology department - I also come across several scientists devoted to the eradication of the kind of crop pests that can wreck national economies or experts in mosquito behaviour who are helping fight endemic disease - is in criminology. The museum has led the way in this field for the past 25 years. Hall's predecessor wrote the seminal book on the subject. 'Our involvement is three pronged,' Hall says, 'we do research, training and casework.'</p> <p>The casework involves attending the crime scene of around 20 murders a year, some of them extremely high profile. Pathologists are not precise in estimating the time of death, but Hall has developed a method that is pretty foolproof. He collects any insect life or maggots from a corpse and does calculations based on their size correlated against temperature. 'Obviously a crime scene is not a controlled environment but I work out how big they are, and within a range I can usually get to an answer.'</p> <p>I wonder how easy it is to get some of the things he witnesses out of his head. How do you avoid disgust? 'Sometimes it is extremely hard, but there is still a sense of profound curiosity about it all,' he adds, brightly. The point is, he says, that he has 'a huge amount of admiration for these kinds of flies'. There are, too, varieties that have developed only to live in particularly safe places - the nostril of a camel, or the stomach of a rhino. 'The fact is, all the time, you have to take your hat off to evolution.'</p> <p>That phrase might make a good motto for the museum as a whole. The more of its latest exhibits I meet - dragonfly expert Steve Brooks, and curator of arachnids Jan Beccaloni, a woman with a spidery tangle of hair and a line in gothic jewellery - the more I get a sense of the kind of passion for natural wonder that the 'exhibition of scientists' will project. I travel down to Southfields, in south London, to see Blanca Huertas, who is holed up in a warehouse with 3m butterflies in cases. Huertas, a woman who knows an awful lot about cocoons, cannot wait to move to the new building, though the task of transporting the collection is daunting. She is used to a challenge, however.</p> <p>Huertas grew up in Columbia and is engaged in an ongoing study of the butterfly life of some of her homeland's uncharted northern jungles. Her field trips generally involve her being dropped out of a helicopter in the remotest of places with a tent and a butterfly net. She comes back with a few thousand butterflies to catalogue. A couple of years ago she discovered both a new species of butterfly and a new species of bird in these forests. Some of the moths favour coca plants however, and the field work, she says, ruefully, is hampered a little by the presence of drug cartels.</p> <p>Huertas came to the museum first as a volunteer, but she has stayed, inspired by the history of the collection and its extraordinary range. As we talk she pulls open drawers from memory - here are some of Nabokov's radiant blue butterflies, here is a Queen Alexandra butterfly so big that in the 18th century when the first one was discovered the collector shot</p> <p>it with a gun, thinking it was a bird. It still has the hole through its wing. 'The thing is,' Huertas says, 'I believe you can explain everything with butterflies.' She was a teacher in Columbia for a while. 'It is,' she says, 'quite hard in Colombia to earn a full-time living as a butterfly collector. But as a teacher all I needed was butterflies: with them my students learned all about genetics, taxonomy, camouflage, evolution, physics, life and death ...'</p> <p>It is this kind of knowledge that she hopes the big cocoon will inspire. 'It's there to encourage a next generation of scientists, to prove that we are not boring men with lab coats or girls with awful glasses.'</p> <p>That may be the future but, for the time being, the closest the museum gets to proper interactivity is in the broom-cupboard office of the Insect Information Service. Stuart Hine sits surrounded by matchboxes and jiffy bags full of unusual creepy-crawlies that the great British public have found under their pillows or in their sock drawers. He and a colleague deal with about 4,000 such enquiries a year, plus a lively line in identifying refugees in imported foodstuffs: black widows in banana boxes, tarantulas in orange crates.</p> <p>Hine goes through his unusual in-tray. They have had a run on hornets ever since the BBC did a documentary about a giant oriental species, and everyone believes they have found one. In one bag is a bee with hairy feet - 'a hairy-footed flower bee'. And there is a strange collection of what look like dried dates: 'A chap in a jungle in India was recovering an engine from a Spitfire that crashed in the war and they discovered these - pupa cases from solitary bees.'</p> <p>Sometimes Hine is called to the front desk to be confronted with a live scorpion someone has found in their shoe after a holiday. Once, a man brought in something he'd found on his person in Richmond Park. Hine had to sit him down to explain it was a parasitic crab louse.</p> <p>Often it seems he is the 'go to' man for the whole world's bugs. 'We get in fruit flies that can devastate a whole country in the developing world, and because of the expertise here and the breadth of the collection, no one else can help - though these things evolve so fast that often they're new even to the specialists here.'</p> <p>At the other end of the scale there are plenty of regulars. 'A few old ladies with a bit of time on their hands will call to say, \"Ooh Stuart, I've found another one.\"' Whatever the enquiry, Hine clearly loves every minute of it. 'There are 23,500 insects and spiders in Britain and no one knows all of them, but I know most.' His purpose, and the purpose of the museum is clear. 'My single mission in life is to make people more aware of the life around them. It mystifies me that people are interested in what's on Mars when all of this stuff is at their feet to be handled and touched.'</p> <p>It feels very much like a quiet crusade, all of this; in fact just the kind of determined crusade, carried over four centuries, that might evolve a giant cocoon that will soon contain more of the planet's DNA than any other building on earth.</p> <h2>The curators</h2> <p><strong>Blanca Huertas, curator of butterflies</strong></p> <p>'I grew up in Bogota and when I was 12 I started collecting butterflies. By the age of 15 it was pretty much my obsession. I still go out into the field every six months. I don't go to research stations; I try to go to the really wild places. We have had a project since 2003 in Colombia, but now the drug gangs are there so it is a bit harder to go.</p> <p>You don't know immediately in the field that you have found a new species, but you have a good idea. You definitely start to be suspicious - it is something new, and sometimes: 'bingo!' Some people auction names of new butterflies to fund their collections, but we don't do that.</p> <p>I love the fact you can explain everything with them. It is quite hard in Columbia to earn a full-time living as a butterfly collector. But as a teacher I could explain everything with butterflies: genetics, taxonomy, camouflage, life and death.'</p> <p><strong>Martin Hall, forensic entomologist</strong></p> <p>'I get called in when the timing of death becomes an issue in a murder case. You collect maggots from the body and check their size, work out their gestation and correlate it against likely temperature. A crime scene is not a controlled environment, but within a range I can usually get to an answer. During the summer flies find the body very quickly and the process is speeded up.</p> <p>We just got a big grant from the government to get some imaging equipment that will allow us to look more closely at specimens, so we can collect more unusual visitors to a wound. The great thing here is that I can call on all the staff to help me to identify something. There is always someone who knows, even if I don't. It's not a new art though. There is evidence of forensic entymology being used in China in the 14th century. The suspects were lined up and the flies began to settle on the sickle of man who had committed the murder.'</p> <p><strong>Mark Spencer, curator of British and European herbariums</strong></p> <p>'One of the problems with the current building is that we have a 45C annual temperature range, which makes it hard to preserve the plants. The most ever-present danger are the little beetles. They love the daisy family and the carrot family; they'd happily munch through the entire collection. We are creating a pest-controlled environment in the cocoon - but beetles are cunning, and a few will no doubt get in.</p> <p>What I try to get across to people is the scale of the threat British plants are facing. The talk of the biodiversity crisis is not restricted to the Tropics. Take the stinging nettle, up until the late 18th century it was a very patchy and localised plant; but stinging nettles love nitrogen, and now because of the use of nitrate fertilisers their levels have gone through the roof. Two hundred years ago your average British ditch would have been full of a huge diversity of plants. That has all gone. Now it's full of nettles.'</p> <p><strong>Jan Beccaloni, curator of arachnids</strong></p> <p>'I look after all the things with eight legs, two body parts, no wings and jaws. The larger scorpions tend to be a wonderful kind of British racing green colour, but they lose that when they are dead. The best thing about them is that they fluoresce.</p> <p>It makes collecting them so easy. Once, we went out at night in South Africa and just held up a UV light and we saw them all running up trees and across the ground. Oddly, I'm a bit scared of the dark, and you have to be careful that when looking for scorpions you don't tread on something really unpleasant, that doesn't fluoresce, like a snake.</p> <p>Aside from the scorpions it's the big spiders that really take my fancy. But I'll have a go at anything really. I've been doing some work with the mite collection lately. It's one of those classic jobs - 'What did you do at the office today, darling?' 'Actually I spent the afternoon measuring a mite's anus.' But then my husband is the curator of cockroaches, so he's used to it. We tend to go on holidays to places where we can collect specimens - sometimes you feel you don't really need to leave your hotel room to get a good range of things.'</p> <p><strong>Steve Brooks, researcher in midges and climate change</strong></p> <p>'I've spent the past 15 years identifying the heads of midge larvae taken from the sediment in lakes and, with a knowledge of the environments different midges favour, looking at how the temperature has changed - with an accuracy of about one degree centigrade.</p> <p>We concentrate on the last 2.5m years. We know from the midges, for example, that the temperatures in Scotland fell by 5C in five or 10 years before the last Ice Age</p> <p>My real passion, though, is dragonflies. Ever since I can remember I have loved them. I used to go out pond dipping with my dad in Coventry and I got into the larvae mainly because they are really mean and they will eat anything you put in a container with them. I quite liked that. The adult emerging is a wonderful transformation that you can witness on your windowsill in the early hours of the morning. Oddly, these days things are actually looking up for dragonflies - climate change has definitely benefited them.'</p>",

The season premiere of Gossip Girl - also about spoiled, rich high schoolers, but set in New York rather than Los Angeles - garnered 3.4 million viewers. HBO's hit series Entourage, which chronicles the exploits of a young Hollywood celebrity and his friends, begins its fifth season Sunday night.</p> <p>To be sure, middle-class Americans have long been fascinated with how the other half lives.

Wigan full-back Kevin Kilbane made his 49th consecutive competitive appearance wearing a protective mask over his fractured cheekbone. Georgia boss Hector Cuper made four changes to the side which beat Wales 2-1 last month, one of which saw AC Milan defender Kakha Kaladze return.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Anthemwatch:</strong> Although respectfully chuntered by the crowd, the Irish Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann (The Soldier's Song) is spanked by the operatic Georgian equivalent Tavisupleba, which translates as Liberty.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>5pm:</strong> The first email is in, and Oliver Parry bangs me to rights: \"'The heady days of Georgi Kinkladze, Shota Arveladze and Temuri Ketsbaia are over.',\" he says, quoting the intro. \"So Georgia these days have to persevere with such mediocre journeymen as Champion's League winner Kakha Kaladze of Milan? I think what you mean is the heady days of Georgian players that play in the UK are over.\" Yes. That actually is what I meant.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 mins:</strong> And we're off. Stephen Hunt gets himself into a promising position early on, but a despairing lunge from the Georgian centre back blocks him. The wires still haven't published the full team lists, and I'm too daunted by the prospect of typing out all the Georgian names. Bear with us another couple of minutes.</p> <p>\"Kevin Kilbane's making his 49th consecutive competitive appearance wearing a protective mask?\" says Mac Millings. \"After all that time, you'd have thought his cheekbone would have healed by now. He should see a doctor about that.\" Not my words, Mac. The words of Damien Spellman, PA Sport in Mainz.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 mins: </strong>AC Milan's Kakha Kaladze deals comfortably with a break down the left from Reading's Kevin Doyle. Meanwhile, protective masks for footballers have really come on leaps and bounds: Kilbane's is practically invisible, but for the white padding either side of his cheeks.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 mins: </strong>Georgia whip in a decent-ish cross from a left-wing free kick. Given gathers comfortably. No real shape to proceedings as yet, although a couple of hefty challenges from Georgia, most recently on Kilbane.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 mins: </strong>The Georgia No9, who I think is Iashvili although I don't know for sure because the team lists still haven't been published anywhere I can copy-paste them from, finds some room in the Irish box but drags a tame shot wide.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 mins: GOAL! Georgia 0 Ireland 1</strong><br>Splendid stuff from Ireland who take the lead with their first meaningful attack. Robbie Keane holds onto the ball on the edge of the box long enough for Aiden McGeady to take a dart outside him down the right. McGeady puts in a perfect first-time cross and Kevin Doyle is there to nod in from three yards. Easy.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>16 mins:</strong> And here's who's playing:<br><strong>Georgia:</strong> Loria, Lobjanidze, Kaladze, Shashiashvili, Kenia, Aleksidze, Iashvili, Kobiashvili, Khizanishvili, Odikadze, Menteshashvili.<br>Subs: Makaridze, Salukvadze, Siradze, McHedlidze, Asatiani, Mchedildze.</p> <p><strong>Rep of Ireland:</strong> Given, Finnan, Kilbane, O'Shea, Dunne, Whelan, McGeady, Steven Reid, Doyle, Keane, Hunt.<br>Subs: Kiely, Andy Reid, Miller, McShane, Delaney, Keogh, Murphy.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 mins:</strong> The 18-year-old Georgian goalkeeper Loria gets his name in lights - a Channel 5 on-screen caption, at least - for a double save after an Ireland corner. He kind of flaps at the first effort, then makes a diving save somewhere near his penalty spot when Glenn Whelan drives one in from 30 yards. Ruchard Dunne skews his chance wide. Ireland then win another corner, which Loria catches as unconvincingly as a catch can be.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 mins: </strong>Giovanni Trapattoni is barking orders from the bench, although Ireland are already looking remarkably comfortable here, with the Georgian midfield struggling to control even the simplest ball. Aiden McGeady is finding plenty of space down the right.</p> <p>Mac Millings has a riff, and he's going to ride it: \"One of the keys to improving medical equipment, including face masks, is long-term use by patients; hence, after 49 consecutive cheek-protected appearances, Kevin Kilbane wears the world's most advanced invisible face mask. It's the face mask against which all others must now be judged.\" See 5.05pm update for part one. Although it might not be worth the scrolling time.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>29 mins:</strong> Steven Reid is pulling the strings in midfield and sends Stephen Hunt on a hurtle down the left. It's stopped in agricultural fashion by Khizanishvili, who picks up a yellow card for depositing Hunt on the turf. Reid steps up and sends a thundering grasscutter through the wall at Loria, who dives to his left and saves. Again, massively unconvincingly.</p> <p>From the high-brow end of the mailbox comes Gary Naylor: \"I know there's a bit of baggage with this statement, but as an Englishman, do I owe my country's two greatest victories in no small part to Georgians? I refer, of course, to the linesman of 1966 and the psychopathic General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of 1941 - 1945.\"</p> <p>And in the gutter: \"With all them Villies, its odd that Georgia can't get better penetration.\" Peering at the stars is Brian Foley.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>33 mins:</strong> Some good versatility here from Ireland who are actually looking like they have some genuine invention coming from their silver-haired manager. Hunt and McGeady are swapping wings and attacking with pace and Doyle is prowling the box. Good stuff.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>36 mins:</strong> Richard Dunne deals with two left wing crosses from Iashvili, the first time out-muscling Aleksidze in the air, and then getting in front of him to clear with his feet. Given untroubled, as he was moments later when Iashvili blasts one over the bar having left John O'Shea for dead.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> Kenia, who has an agreeable name to the MBM reporter, cons the referee into awarding a free kick when Stephen Hunt slides in and takes the ball. It's about 40 yards out, centre. The free kick is thumped into the wall and off for a corner which, in turn, is wasted when Iashvili puts a free header over the bar from six yards. He's totally unmarked and should have buried that one.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>40 mins: </strong>If this isn't your thing, and you prefer former Bluebells and Commotions bassists live blogging on Scottish tennis sensations playing Spanish minotaurs in New York, then you <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/09/06/us_open_semifinal_nadal_v_murr.html\">could always follow Lawrence Donegan on Andy Murray's US Open semi-final</a>, which has just started.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> Aiden McGeady is out left now, but isn't having muc joy over there. Georgia are now closing down much quicker than the slip-shod earlier stages. Kobiashvili finds the chance to charge forward, but Reid gets a toe in and Ireland clear.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>45+2 mins:</strong> McGeady again goes on a scamper down the left but finds the 311th and 312th Georgia defenders just too many to beat on one dribble and is double-teamed out of it. Reid blasts the free kick to Frankfurt. And then peep, peep, peep: that's the end of a largely satisfactory first 45 in Mainz.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Half time</strong> Colin Murray. Pat Nevin. David O'Leary. Channel Five. In better news, Murray has broken Nadal.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Half time:</strong> \"At the risk of displaying insufferable pedantry,\" begins Oliver Parry, who need not apologise to the loyal army of MBM pedants. \"I have to point out that the 'Russian linesman' that called Geoff Hurst's non-existent second goal in 1966, was Azerbaijani not Georgian. His name was Tofik Bakhramov and he is also revered in his home country, with the national football stadium named after him.\" To be repeated in pubs up and down the land tonight.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> Peeeeeep. And we're off again. No substitutes at half-time, Georgia are playing in their traditional all white; Ireland all green. Georgia are kicking from left to right on this TV screen.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>49 mins: </strong>Thrilling intrigue from the pitch-side reporter, who, at half-time, thought Shay Given might be injured because Dean Kiely was called to the dressing room from the half-time substitutes' warm-up. Turns out, chuckle, chuckle, that Given had ripped his shirt and they couldn't find a replacement, meaning Kiely was going to have to give his up. But fear not, they found the replacement and that's the end of that non-story. On the pitch, Robbie Keane is fouled about 30 yards out, and the free-kick is bent into the box, forcing Loria in the Georgia goal to claw it clear. Ireland then have successive corners and the second one finds John O'Shea totally in the clear six yards out, but his hopeless header is over.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>52 mins: </strong>The former Chelsea striker Aleksidze leaps with John O'Shea and Richard Dunne at the back, but his is a hopeless Maradona impression as his handball is not only completely obvious, but directs it meekly into the ground.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>55 mins: Post! </strong>Inches away from 2-0 for Ireland, after Champions League winning defender Kakha Kaladze sends a woeful backpass trickling towards his keeper. Robbie Keane is on to it, rounds the keeper, but is off balance and at an acute angle as he tries to steer it into the empty net. It hits the post and pings out to Aiden McGeady, who drives his chance wide.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>60 mins: </strong>A couple of missed chances in the past ten minutes, then, for Ireland. O'Shea's was far the worst, but with one goal in four years for his country, no one can be surprised. The former Chelsea man Aleksidze is subbed for Georgia, replaced by David Siradze.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>63 mins:</strong> OK, O'Shea is back in the good books after he makes a terrific interception when a cross comes pinging into the box and a Georgian striker is lurking with intent. O'Shea lurches forward and cuts out the danger. But Georgia are now looking far the brighter.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>66 mins:</strong> Richard Dunne manages to clear some more Georgia pressure with his rear-end as a long free kick goes into the far post, has the Manchester City man spinning hopelessly underneath it and it lands with Khizanishvili. His dab towards goal ricochets off the pirouetting Dunne and off for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>69 mins: </strong>Some trademark Robbie Keane whingeing - arms flailing in perceived injustice - is prompted by Aiden McGeady taking a tumble on the edge of the box. Nothing given but is doesn't matter because...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>70 mins: GOAL! Georgia 0-2 Ireland: </strong>Glenn Whelan finds plenty of space 30 yards out and has no other options but to have a speculative shy at goal. It's looking for all the world like a comfortable gather for the goalkeeper, but he only manages to scoop it into his own net in slapstick fashion.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>74 mins:</strong> An Irish reveller, possibly with more alcohol in his blood than would allow him to drive legally in most countries, makes a mad dash for the pitch with a number of German stewards in hot pursuit. Cue much sanctimony from the commentary box, whistles from the crowd and super slo-mo of a man in an orange bib tumbling over an advertising hoarding.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>77 mins: </strong>Liam Miller is on for Kevin Doyle, and No5 is on for Iashvili for Georgia.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Espanyol's Steve Finnan is replaced by Maplins' Paul McShane. Stephen Hunt drifts into the Georgia box from the left, but can't pick out Robbie Keane with his cross. It's fairly pedestrian stuff now, with Ireland confident that they've done enough.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>82 mins:</strong> Asatiani comes on in place of Khizanishvili, a saving of five letters. Georgia have all the possession in midfield, but can't penetrate, Richard Dunne hacking clear when they do manage to lump the ball into the box.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>85 mins:</strong> Ireland are edging towards a comfortable victory, while England, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/06/worldcup2010qualifiers.englandfootballteam\">according to Scott Murray's minute-by-minute pre-match build up</a>, have gone with Joleon Lescott and Theo Walcott for their match against Andorra. Scotland earlier lost to Macedonia and now Northern Ireland have gone and got themselves beat by Slovakia. Andy Murray is a set up against Rafael Nadal.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>89 mins: </strong>Andy Keogh is on for Aiden McGeady, who was tireless until he got tired and went off. Kevin Kilbane clears what passes for danger in the Ireland box this match when he heads a deep cross clear. Three minutes of injury time.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>90+1 mins: </strong>Some too late for this now ping-pong in the Ireland box, ends with Richard Dunne hacking clear for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>90+2 mins: GOAL! Georgia 1-2 Ireland </strong>- Ah, yes, it's never too late to grab a goal against Ireland, as Kenia proves. The corner is low and not especially powerful, but somehow Kenia manages to take it, sidestep John O'Shea and thump it past both Shay Given and Paul McShane on the line.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>90+3 mins: Peep, peep, peep. </strong> That's it: it's over. Ireland try to capitulate right at the death but leave it <em>just</em> too late for a heroic collapse. It's 2-1, thanks to goals from Kevin Doyle and Glenn Whelan and Trapattoni is out of the traps with a win. Thanks for your emails.

  "<p><br>Cansei de Ser Sexy, kicking the party off like a mule. Photograph: Dan Martin</p> <p>Lovefoxx from CSS is perplexed. \"There has never been a muddy Bestival? That's sad, because everybody seems to love Bestival.\"</p> <p>You know you're in trouble when even Europe's most excitable adopted party-starters are acting forlornly. There's a rising sense of panic about Robin Hill Park this afternoon, and it's up to these girls to make everything OK.</p> <p>In many ways, they're the perfect Bestival band - they make dance music that's as smart as it is silly and they love fancy dress. The world fell in love with CSS through their funky ability to motivate pretty much any festival crowd going. The Biblical torrents of Bestival shouldn't put them off their stride. \"We're not so much afraid of the mud, now we have our wellies,\" reckons Lovefoxx. \"We've missed the mud, actually. It's the cherry on top of the ice cream.\"</p> <p>Neither will they have any truck with the doom mongering talk lingering around the campaign for new album. From the scurrilous rumours surrounding their sophomore effort, Donkey, you'd think they'd remade the Bible, and as such, their (many, many) festival shows this summer have seen them push their disco shoes even harder. \"We were playing new songs since April last year,\" sniffs the singer. \"Also, the stuff is not such a different sound. It's pretty much the same.\" So CSS are still the festival circuit's definitive party starters? \"Definitely!\"</p> <p>Which just leaves one question, before CSS take off to prepare for their midnight turn at the Big Top. As Bestival's theme is 30,000 Freaks Under The Sea, what would their outfit be? \"Spongebob! Simply because he's the coolest creature living under the sea right now. And the only one who's gay!\"</p> <p>And on that note, we're off to see whether they've got the party started in a fitting manner...</p>"
