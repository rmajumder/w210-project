  "<p>Gap years advertised in glossy brochures are now so passe, it seems. These days a growing number of students are deciding they want to do something more useful with their time out than sleeping on the beach in Goa. They might volunteer for a charity, or use the year to turn an idea into a business venture, or simply get work experience that will dress up their CV and benefit their own long-term future. But a growing number of people go even further: they want an adventure without the selfish, carefree connotations of backpacking. So they set up their own charity adventure. </p> <p>Going it alone adds a bit of unpredictability. Becoming a \"chad\" - or charity adventurer - means inventing your own trip and raising money for your favourite cause. Chads devise their own trip or challenge and then set about attracting publicity. Tom Griffiths, founder of <a href=\"http://www.gapyear.com\">gapyear.com</a>, says chads are \"modern-day adventurers who take on exciting and often dangerous trips for the benefit of others\". In fact, you've probably had an email from a chad asking you to donate to a trip that has made you want to leave the office and board a plane pronto. With the internet, it's now easier than ever to tell thousands about what you are doing and, with sites like <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com\">justgiving.com</a>, it's simple to collect the money, too. Should you give it a go?</p> <p>\"You'll stand out from the other graduates. If you organised your own trip, advertised what you were doing and thought up something really different, you are bound to impress employers,\" Griffiths says. Charity adventures are the last bastion of raw travel adventure, he adds.</p> <h2>Steve Fabes: spent a year cycling in Chile</h2> <p>Steve Fabes left for a gap year cycling from Punta Arenas in southern Chile to Arica, Chile's northernmost city, with his brother, Ronan, in 2000. Fabes, then 19, and Ronan, then 17, planned the five month trip on their own.</p> <p>\"The idea was appealing because the country crosses so many different terrains. There's Patagonia in the south, then the middle is Mediterranean in climate and the north is dry. We literally got a map and pointed, and said: 'We'll go from there to there',\" he says. </p> <p>\"We were a bit naive when we started out. We had to take the pedals off our bikes to get them on the plane and we put them back on wrongly and had to find someone to sort our bikes out as soon as we got there. We were very confident travellers by the end, though.\" </p> <p>At the start of their trip, they would cycle for days without seeing other vehicles. \"We realised that our bikes were ill equipped for the terrain, although they were new. Then the Patagonian wind whipped everything off the bikes, so we'd be chasing around for our sleeping bags and tents.\" Central Chile was easier. The pair were fitter by then and used to cycling 100km to 120km a day. They biked past vineyards.<br> \"We would meet quite a few long distance cyclists on our route, which was fun. One of the main things we got to appreciate was how fantastic it was to cycle everywhere. You get invited to sleep in people's homes, in churches and in schools. It was the best way to see somewhere and it was cheap.\" </p> <p>The pair raised \u00a37,000 for cystic fibrosis on their trip. \"It cost us less than \u00a32,000 together in flights, bikes and living costs,\" says Fabes. </p> <p>\"We got great satisfaction from planning the adventure ourselves. But I made sure I spoke to plenty of experts. We asked long-distance cyclists, one of whom literally turned up on my doorstep, to tell me his tips. I emailed people I found who had done similar things.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Steve Fabes is a doctor in London, having graduated from Liverpool University's medical school </p> <h2>Richard Offland: worked with injured wildlife in South Africa</h2> <p>Richard Offland knew he wanted a gap year in South Africa working with animals. But the 18-year-old from Cheshire wasn't going to go with an organised group; he'd sort it out himself.</p> <p>He came across the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds in Cape Town on an internet search last year, after his A-levels. </p> <p>It looked just the ticket. He'd be helping injured penguins until they were healthy enough to go back into the ocean.</p> <p>Offland phoned the charity and arranged his accommodation nearby. He then set about fundraising. He was being sponsored by Worldwide Volunteering and had to pay \u00a3900 to volunteer at the conservation centre for eight weeks.</p> <p>He held car boot sales, put up a display in his local supermarket and sold Easter eggs at school that he'd bought at a discount at a cash and carry. And it was all worth it.</p> <p>\"It was a tremendous experience,\" he says. \"The penguins moult like dogs and it was breeding season, so all the chicks were hatching. The penguins couldn't go into the sea while they moulted so they couldn't get food to feed their chicks. We rescued hundreds of chicks and gave them a health check.</p> <p>\"We'd force-feed the injured penguins. One, Stumpy, had stitches on his belly because he had been attacked by a seal. We'd often get in birds that were so ill, they had lost weight. We would chop up a formula of catfood, fish and vitamins and tube it into them. We disinfected the penguins' pool and their dry area.</p> <p>\"We were invited to release the birds back into the sea when they had been rehabilitated.</p> <p>Offland was the youngest of the volunteers, and loved working with graduates and postgraduates. </p> <p>\"I went on my own and met people out there. I wanted to organise my gap-year adventure myself. Inventing your own itinerary and planning your year yourself gives you a sense of independence. It was also a lot cheaper that way.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Offland is going to Aberdeen University next month to study zoology </p> <h2>Rob Gauntlett and James Hooper: serial fundraisers</h2> <p>When school friends Rob Gauntlett and James Hooper finished their A-levels three years ago, they went on a seven-week, 3,000-mile cycle from Bilbao to Istanbul. It was their first adventure to raise money for Cancer Research UK and the Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged young people. And, although challenging by most people's standards, it was a walk in the park compared to what the pair would later do.</p> <p>Their next mission was to climb Ama Dablam, a mountain in the Himalayan range of eastern Nepal, which is 6,812m high at its main peak. They were hungry for more, and returned to their homes in Sussex and Somerset determined to climb Everest.</p> <p>After fundraising for four months and training in Scotland and the Alps, they set off. The pair, then aged 19, reached the summit from the north side - 8,848m - in May and raised \u00a325,000. \"We had lost three stone each and it took about five to six weeks to recover,\" says Gauntlett. \"Above 8,000m, your body starts to break down and the cells don't replace themselves. I looked like an eight-year-old.\" </p> <p>Instead of feeling elated, they felt low. \"We had a focal point and then it was all over, leaving us feeling awful,\" he says. \"We had to plan something else.\" This would not mean just another charity adventure, it would mean another gap year at least, because to organise their adventure would take at least 18 months. </p> <p>They were going to cycle, ski and sail from the north pole to the south pole. In under a year, they had done it. But only just. At one point Gauntlett fell through ice in Greenland and nearly died. He had dropped his glove and gone back to pick it up. The ice was thin and he fell face-down into -2C water, where he was stuck for a few minutes. He remained unconscious for four hours. Had Hooper not wrapped him in protective clothing and called for an emergency helicopter on the satellite phone, Gauntlett would have died.</p> <p>Once they had recovered, the pair insisted on continuing their trip, against the wishes of friends, family and sponsors. They completed it and collected tens of thousands of pounds from sponsors. Now Gauntlett has a place to study geography at Edinburgh University and Hooper has one to study archaeology at Sheffield University. But after their adventures, the 21-year-olds are not sure they are going to take them up.</p> <p>They are writing a book about their expedition from pole to pole. They give talks at schools on climate change, having seen it first-hand, and in Gauntlett's case, from frighteningly close quarters. \"Years ago, I wouldn't have fallen through the ice because it wouldn't have been so thin,\" he says. They also give talks encouraging pupils to aim high and fulfil their dreams.</p> <h2>How to set up your own charity challenge</h2> <p><strong>Use the web</strong><br>You can read about thousands of other people's trips online, but also, you can build your own website, making it easy for sponsors to donate. Gapyear.com founder Tom Griffiths suggests \"gappers\" invent a name that is short and encapsulates their adventure, such as \"Cycle Chile\". Make that your website address, and put a photo of you doing the activity you are trying to raise money for on the home page. </p> <p><strong>Sort the fundraising</strong><br>Griffiths also advises joining <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com\">justgiving.com</a>, which looks after thousands of fundraising pages. If you have a personal interest in the charity you are raising money for, write about it on the site. He suggests choosing a local charity. \"You might be more likely to get sponsorship and you might get local press coverage.\" </p> <p>Be prepared to face rejection if you seek sponsorship from big firms, says Steve Fabes. He thinks it is probably better to ask friends and family. \"The big corporates get approached by so many people. I sent 150 letters and I got two hits,\" he says. Think of a nice big PR stunt, too, like sitting in a bath of cat food. \"Don't be deterred by people's cynicism,\" says Fabes. \"I had to work hard to convince people I was passionate about the charity; they thought I just wanted to do the trip and should pay for it myself.\" </p> <p><strong>Safety first</strong><br>Most important is your safety. Griffiths recommends the Expedition Advisory Centre. The Foreign Office site, <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk\">fco.gov.uk</a>, is a must to check that your route is safe, while the Lonely Planet's website is useful for reading up on the cultural mores. It's a good idea to learn first aid and to enrol on a safety course with objectivegapyear.com. Make sure you have insurance, that you have had your jabs and have malaria medication. </p> <p><strong>Be prepared</strong><br>Don't be too ambitious, advises Griffiths. It's great to challenge yourself, but don't go overboard. \"It's the quirky element that is important.\" Last, immerse yourself in books about adventures to get you fired up: something by Sir Ranulph Fiennes or Alastair Humphreys should do the trick.</p>",
  "<p>In a Greenwich Village bookstore, a window is filled with a poster that replays a familiar image. A boy and girl are walking down a snow-covered street, arm in arm, lost in some private paradise. He is hunched against the cold. Their heads are together. She is laughing. The photograph was taken 45 years ago, a stone's throw from where the shop stands. It went around the world, touching countless young lives. And now it has come back home.</p> <p>Bob Dylan and Suze Rotolo had been together for 18 months when the photographer Don Hunstein captured them for the cover of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. This album, Dylan's second, was the one that lifted him out of the tight little folk scene and broadcast his talent to a generation of eager young listeners. It was the one with \"Blowin' in the Wind\", \"Masters of War\", \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" and \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\", songs of social conscience, political awareness and a precocious sensitivity to the nuances and contradictions of love. The cover image, its intimacy and informality so far removed from the airbrushed self-presentation of most performers, was the perfect calling card.</p> <p>Sitting in a cafe in New York's East Village, where she now lives, Rotolo laughs at the pitfalls of memory. She and the photographer, she says, recently disagreed on exactly where they were on that cold February day in 1963. A few shots had been taken in the West 4th Street apartment she shared with Dylan. Then they all went outside, into the snow. Dylan, conscious of being in the process of creating an image for himself, pulled on a thin suede jerkin and shivered. Rotolo chose a thick sweater and a favourite loden-green winter coat, more suited to the conditions. Wrapped around each other, they walked through the slush towards the camera. Hunstein says they were on Cornelia Street. Rotolo is convinced it was Jones Street, one block closer to the apartment. \"So that's just going to have to remain a mystery for all those Dylanologists,\" she says, with a note of mischievous delight.</p> <p>Other mysteries are laid bare, and a few quietly preserved, in her new book, A Freewheelin' Time, subtitled A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties. Of all the unwritten books on Dylan, the most thoroughly documented musician of his era, this is perhaps the one most desired by his fans. As he has readily acknowledged, Rotolo played a vital role in his evolution; she was also the inspiration, or so it has always been assumed, for many of his most important early songs. Now a slender, elegant 64-year-old artist, she talks of finally overcoming her lifelong shyness and discretion to give us her commentary on that remarkable time.</p> <p>For many years she kept up her defences against those anxious for revelations about her former boyfriend, but an interview she contributed to No Direction Home, Martin Scorsese's much-praised biographical film on Dylan, helped her to overcome the fear, in a phrase she frequently employs, of \"feeding the beast\". She liked the way the film depicted the broader context: the people, the places, the politics. The first volume of Chronicles, Dylan's own autobiography, was another turn of the key that unlocked her memories. Then she met a Random House editor who suggested that she might write a book along the lines of Joyce Johnson's Minor Characters, an evocation of the author's life as Jack Kerouac's girlfriend in an earlier New York bohemia. It happened to be among Rotolo's favourites.</p> <p>\"My reflex action was to say, 'Thank you very much, but no.' It had been so many years that I'd shut the door. But the way he presented it was, what was it like as a young girl to come from the family I came from and end up in the Village and be in this place and observe it through my own eyes? That was something to think about. Then my son said, 'People have been writing a version of you for years. It's time you told the real one.' It suddenly made sense.\"</p> <p>The book is full of quick, deft sketches of key characters and others more peripheral. There is space for stories that have little or nothing to do with Dylan, such as Rotolo's extraordinary trip to Cuba with a group of students in 1964, breaking the US travel embargo and incurring the government's wrath. Inevitably, however, the narrative is driven by the story of their love affair, from its beginning in 1961 to its end three years later.</p> <p>She first saw him performing in a Village club in the spring of 1961. At the time she was working for Core, the Congress of Racial Equality, and already had many friends within the interlinked scenes of folk music and the civil rights movement. They came face to face a few weeks later, during an all-day session broadcast live from the Riverside Church, high up on the West Side, to raise funds for a radio station. Dylan took the stage mid-afternoon and drew laughter - much of it from women, as a bootleg recording attests - for his protracted comic fumblings with a recalcitrant harmonica holder.</p> <p>\"When he started out as a performer he was playful, a combination of Woody Guthrie and Harpo Marx, with a good dose of himself as a binding ingredient,\" Rotolo remembers. \"He used that playfulness to draw the audience in. With the passing of time, the technique was no longer required. The audience was with him the minute he stepped on stage. A sense of humour, however, was always his strong suit.\"</p> <p>Later that night they went on to a party together. \"Right from the start I couldn't take my eyes off her,\" Dylan wrote in Chronicles. \"She was the most erotic thing I'd ever seen. She was fair skinned and golden haired, full-blood Italian . . . We started talking and my head started to spin . . . She was just my type.\"</p> <p>She was also only 17, to his 21. She had already left the family home, but subterfuges were necessary until she turned 18 that November and they could legally live together in the two-room flat he had found for $60 a month on the top floor of 161 West 4th Street. It was only then, when they returned home after a night's drinking and his wallet fell out of his pocket, that she saw his draft card and discovered that his real name was not Dylan but Zimmerman: an early warning of his penchant for self-mythologising.</p> <p>She took him to art galleries, and introduced him to her favourite poets and playwrights. Through her he discovered Picasso and C\u00e9zanne, the French symbolist poets (\"Situations have ended sad / Relationships have all been bad / Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud,\" he wrote years later), Brecht and the politics of dissent, all of which he could stir together with the cultural influences he had brought with him from Minnesota - Kerouac, Guthrie, Robert Johnson. He looked on as she sketched constantly, and picked up the habit.</p> <p>Her parents, the children of Italian immigrants, were active communists with a strong artistic bent. \"I was always an artist,\" she says. \"I came from a family where art was important.\" Her father supplied occasional illustrations to the New York Times, but preferred to pursue a vocation as a union organiser until his death from a heart attack when Suze was 14. Her mother worked for a communist newspaper; her older sister, Carla, was an assistant to Alan Lomax, the celebrated musicologist.</p> <p>At that stage Dylan didn't even have a recording contract, and her book describes the mounting exhilaration as he took his first steps to fame. In the summer of 1962, however, she decided to accept an invitation from her mother and her new stepfather to accompany them on a trip to Europe, and to revive an earlier plan for her to study art in Perugia. Her friends were divided. Dylan said it was up to her, but he'd much rather she stayed. He waved from the docks as her ship pulled out, before going back to the apartment to write the first of many airmail letters. \"Everybody is waiting for the cooler weather,\" he wrote after she had settled into her student existence, \"and I am just waiting for you.\"</p> <p>While in Umbria she read Fran\u00e7oise Gilot's Life with Picasso and felt a shock of recognition. \"I felt I was reading a book of revelations, lessons, warnings,\" she writes. \"Even though Picasso was a much older man than Bob and had experienced a lot more, their personalities were so similar that it was astounding.\" Her doubts about living in the shadow of such a man contributed to her decision to extend her stay from four to six months; on her return, she discovered that she had incurred the disapproval of Dylan's inner circle for leaving him so bereft.</p> <p>Nevertheless, they resumed their relationship, and she moved back into the apartment while working at a variety of jobs that included designing folk-club posters, working for small theatre companies and waitressing. She invited him to a rehearsal of George Tabori's Brecht on Brecht at the Sheridan Square Playhouse, and in one of the most vivid passages of Chronicles he describes how hearing the performance of Kurt Weill's \"Pirate Jenny\" provoked a fundamental change in his approach to songwriting. Rotolo, too, remembers the moment. \"He sat still and quiet. Didn't even jiggle his leg.\"</p> <p>Nowadays she doesn't care to listen to the songs of parting and loss he wrote while she was away - \"Don't Think Twice\", \"One Too Many Mornings\", \"Tomorrow is a Long Time\" - even though, like their composer, she firmly resists literal interpretations. \"People ask, 'Was this song written for you?' Well, I could say this and that. I could make a list. But if you really listen to those songs, they're somewhat like fiction - he's written something coming from his life, but he sets it in a fiction, maybe using another character's voice. </p> <p>\"I can recognise things. It's like looking at a diary. It brings it all back. And what's hard is that you remember being unsure of how life was going to go - his, mine, anybody's. So, from the perspective of an older person looking back, you enjoy them, but also think of them as the pain of youth, the loneliness and the struggle that youth is, or may be.\"</p> <p>There was certainly plenty of pain. She describes the strains imposed by her mother's and sister's dislike of Dylan, by his gathering celebrity and by her need to assert the right to an independent existence. Her background made it easy for her to cope with his creative needs (\"I could see that he was an artist at work\"), but in those days there was little vocabulary to cope with the world's insistence that the girlfriend should sit quietly in the background.</p> <p>\"I was a young girl of my time. I was shy and timid, and I would be envious of men who could go to a cafe and sit and draw and read or write songs or do whatever they could do. If a girl did that it would mean that she was alone, she wasn't with somebody, she was an easy woman. It would take a lot of courage to do it, and when you did it, you took a chance.\"</p> <p>In one of her book's many memorable phrases, she describes Dylan as \"a beacon and a black hole\". \"He had this intensity about him, and you got sucked in,\" she says. \"I certainly felt that, as his girlfriend, I disappeared and became a nonentity. Even if he didn't see me that way, that's what happened. That was always a struggle.</p> <p>\"There are people who say that he was not a good guy - he was manipulative, he was this, that and the other. I tend to see it as, you are what you are. He could be a shit, like anybody else. But a lot of it had to do with being given permission to say and do whatever you wanted, because nobody was in a position to tell you no. Everybody's yessing you, and everybody wants a piece of you. So what do you do?\"</p> <p>A particularly large piece was claimed by Joan Baez, who arrived on the Dylan scene in the summer of 1963. Already a star, she performed his songs and began inviting him on stage to sing with her. He stayed at her home in California and soon the rumours got back to New York. When Baez joined Dylan on his own tour, however, she found him unwilling to return the favour. They had served each other's purposes, but the casualty was Rotolo.</p> <p>\"It's a very long time ago,\" she says, \"and there are no residual hurt feelings. I think she's an example of a woman who really knew what she wanted and how to get it, and to everybody else, the hell with you. Which men could do easily. She went out and got what she wanted, and then he in turn did it for her and then he didn't. That was him going after what he wanted, with no baggage. He never looked back. He just kept going.\"</p> <p>The book's unvarnished description of their slow break-up - \"He avoided responsibility . . . I was difficult and unreasonable\" - makes a poignant contrast with the famous image of the carefree lovers. A climactic row was followed by the discovery of her pregnancy, an illegal abortion, a brief reunion and her breakdown. \"It was the hardest thing to write about. I was young and vulnerable and insecure. There were pressures from all around and I couldn't find my place any more. I didn't feel I had anybody I could turn to. That makes you really fall apart. And that's how I felt.\"</p> <p>She escaped to Italy for a while, and in 1970 married Enzo Bartoliocci, whom she had met during her student days in Perugia. Now her husband is a film editor at the UN; their son, Luca, was born 28 years ago and is a luthier: \"Only four people in New York know what that means. He makes guitars.\" </p> <p>Inevitably, after such a hurtful parting, she and Dylan lost contact for a while. But when many of her possessions - including the loden-green coat and his old Gibson guitar - were lost in a fire in her apartment a few years later, he helped her out. In occasional touch, they remain respectful of each other and of their shared history. When she describes the episodic, overlapping structure of her book, and the effort to recall long-spent emotions, she could almost be him, talking about a song. \"It isn't factual,\" she says, \"but it's true. So it doesn't go from page to page. But the emotion that I managed to find is true.\"</p>",

  "<p>The first short story I wrote was a work of genius. It was austere and lovely, full of elegant sentences and sharp insights. Any reviewer would have called it tremendously impressive. Because the first short story I wrote was by John McGahern. It's called \"Sierra Leone\" and it appears in the 1979 collection Getting Through, a copy of which had been purchased by my father. A keen reader of Irish fiction, he felt always, like my late mother, a particular respect for McGahern, who had suffered much through being true to his calling. McGahern's novel The Dark had been banned in Ireland for obscenity, and its author had lost his job as a teacher. But, remarkably, he seemed accepting of fate and circumstance. He simply kept writing, never complained. He did not make appearances on chat shows. </p> <p>In \"Sierra Leone\", two lovers meet in a Dublin bar to analyse their complicated affair. I was 16 the year I first read it. Complicated affairs interested me. My English teacher, John Burns, a wonderful man, who would rage like Lear and weep at a line of Yeats, said writing could be a beneficial pastime for teenagers. It was the one thing he ever told us that was completely wrong. </p> <p>Writing was like attempting to juggle with mud. I would sit in my bedroom, gawping at a blank jotter, wishing I had the foggiest inkling as to what might be written. This McGahern fellow - he was good, my parents were right - often wrote about rural Leitrim and the wilds of Roscommon, and crops, and cows, and taking in the hay, and buckets, and threshing, and artificial inseminators. But we had no hedgerows or calves in the 1970s Dublin estate I called home. We had no thwarted farmers, no maiden aunts on bicycles, no small-town solicitors, no cattle-dealing IRA veterans, and few enough inseminations, or opportunities for same, of even the non-artificial kind. Simply put, there was nothing in Glenageary to write about. You could call it the original failure of the creative imagination without which no writer ever got going. </p> <p>Whenever I tried to write, there was only frustration. One evening, in dismal hopelessness, I found myself copying out \"Sierra Leone\" word for word. I ached to write a story. So I wrote one of his. I must have felt that the act of writing would make the words somehow mine. I suppose it was comparable to aspirant pop-stars throwing shapes and pulling pouts in the bathroom mirror. But something richer and more interesting was going on, too. McGahern was teaching me to read, not to write: to see the presences hidden in the crannies of a text, the realities the words are gesturing towards. Perhaps this is what pulses at the core of the desire to read: the yearning for intense communion with words we love. Not just with what they are saying, but with the words themselves. Perhaps every reader is re-writing the story.</p> <p>A couple of evenings later, I transcribed the McGahern piece again. This time I dared to alter a couple of names. The male lead became Sean (my father's name). I christened his girlfriend Deborah (after the punk singer Debbie Harry). Our next-door neighbour, Jack Mulcahy, had his name nicked for the barman. This felt taboo. It was like editing the Bible. I was raised in a home where books were revered. My parents considered it disreputable even to dog-ear a volume's pages. To interfere with a story would have been regarded as a form of sacrilege. Under the spell of McGahern, I became a teenage blasphemer. </p> <p>Every few nights I'd guiltily rewrite the latest adaptation, changing the grammar here, a phrasing there. I'd move around events, break up the paragraphs, or tell exactly the same story from a different point of view. (In which case, of course, it would not be the same story at all - an important lesson in itself.) I must have written 30 or 40 versions. The heroine's black hair became auburn or yellow, and finally - exultantly! - \"strawberry blonde\". I learned the importance of punctuation in a story. A question mark could change things. A well-placed full stop had the force of a slap. Before long, I was murdering McGahern's masterfully sculpted characters, replacing them with my own pitifully scanty puppets. The pub became a discotheque, the couple acquired flares; I engaged them, married them, bought them a bungalow in the suburbs, then a collection of Planxty records and a second-hand lawnmower. The lovers in the story were starting to seem familiar. They would not have appeared out of place in Arnold Grove, Glenageary.</p> <p>I rechristened them \"Adam and Eve\", after a church on the Dublin quays not far from my father's childhood home. I altered their appearances, their way of speaking. I was afraid to admit it, but I knew who they were becoming. They roamed this fictive otherworld, this Eden designed in Leitrim, talking to each other about all sorts of things: how much they loved novels, how books shouldn't be dog-eared. Sometimes they quarrelled. I would have them reconcile. I could almost feel the firelight of that pub on my face as I watched my parents materialise through the prose. </p> <p>At one point I could have made a reasonable stab at reciting the entire text of \"Sierra Leone\" by heart. It appeared breathtakingly simple, as though it had taken no effort to compose. I recall, as I write now, one of the short, plain sentences: \"Her hair shone dark blue in the light.\" It is a sentence that could be written by almost anyone, but few writers are as aware as McGahern was of that strange ache in the heart caused by ordinary precise words, placed carefully, in order, quietly.</p> <p>Each man kills the thing he loves. And so the vandalism continued, over many an evening, with me editing and rewriting this once perfect story, slashing and burning, twisting, demolishing, with all the respectful deference of a wrecking ball in a cathedral, until gradually, over the span of my teenage years, every trace of McGahern was bludgeoned out of the text. Sierra Leone had become Glenageary. The story had been desecrated, but at least the resulting ruin was mine.</p> <p>When, once, in my later life, I had the opportunity of relating this tale of destruction to the master whose work I had so abused, he replied, somewhat gravely: \"Mine's a pint.\"</p> <p>Dublin appears again and again in McGahern's work, sometimes at a distance but often centrally. His exquisite short stories are peopled by migrant characters who see the metropolis as labyrinth of possibilities. Here is a Dublin of tatty dancehalls and uneasy courtships, of kisses in damp doorways and unfulfilled hungerings. His citizens are stalwarts of the city's rural-born workforce, who take the first available bus home to the countryside on a Friday evening and the last one back to Bedsit-Land on a Sunday night. They are, in short, like most Dubliners were at the time, and as many are now, despite the new prosperity. Their flings and farewells make for writing of extraordinary beauty, with the city as forlorn backdrop to the search for love.</p> <p>McGahern's work acknowledges that Dublin (like capitals everywhere) is largely a community of migrants with conflicted loyalties. And I think of his explorations - so destabilising in their way - as opening a path for a number of subsequent writers. In that context, it is striking that much of the most compelling fiction about the city has been produced by authors who grew up somewhere else. Ulsterman Patrick McCabe's The Dead School and London-born Philip Casey's The Fabulists offer commanding reflections on a place that changed radically in the 1970s, as political failure and corruption began to wreak havoc. In The Book of Evidence, Wexford-born John Banville produced a spellbinding novel set in the furtive Dublin of that Gubu era, a nighttown of whispered secrets and compromised positions. I find it hard to imagine how these and other great novels could have been written without the presence of McGahern on the Irish scene. For me, he looms behind everyone: an Easter Island figure, with the ineluctable shadow - and the sternness - suggested by such an embodiment.</p> <p>At University College Dublin in the 80s, I read The Barracks, The Dark and more of the stories. I found them strange, always enthralling, stylistically flawless, but more touching than almost anything I had read. His account, clearly autobiographical, of a young man's early days at university - the first of his family ever to know such an experience - moves me still. At the time, the vogue among my friends was for Latin American magic realism. In those years, it often seemed that no novel was worthy of the name unless it contained a talking leopard or a 15-page sentence. Against this blizzard of vowelly pyrotechnics McGahern's work stood solid, starkly implacable, like a dry-stone wall in a windstorm. I loved its quiet faith, its insistence on its own terms. And then came his masterpiece Amongst Women, the most important Irish novel of my lifetime.</p> <p>So much has been written and said about this sparely magnificent book. It conjures a world that is absolutely specific to itself, down to the most minuscule, seemingly inconsequential detail, but in so doing achieves the alchemy of saying something about every life. Not for nothing did this novel become a perennial bestseller in Ireland, as well as being garlanded with critical accolades. The family it depicts is somehow every Irish family of a certain era, held together by its secrets, bound by its evasions, by a nexus of loyalties, only one of which is love. Indeed, it is difficult not to read the Morans as embodying the uneasy nation in which they exist. </p> <p>The book draws so subtly from that well of Irish familial images and returns them to us reimagined, made wholly new. Moran, the disillusioned republican, burnished hard by pain, walks through the book like a living ghost, through drifts of memories of nights on the run, promises broken, responsibilities ducked. A man grown strange, even to himself, so brutal yet impossible to hate. The episode at Moran's funeral, is the most powerful fictional scene I have read since my adolescence. We see the local hacks of the two conservative parties snickering together in the rural cemetery, as the embittered old revolutionary is finally buried. Sometimes great writers know things they don't know. This tableau was composed a decade before the Celtic Tiger padded into Ireland, but it is the most ruthless comment imaginable on that ambiguous, sharp-toothed beast. </p> <p>His final novel, That They May Face the Rising Sun, took 11 years to make and surprised many of its creator's admirers by addressing that rarest of Irish literary subjects: happiness. Here on the lakeside, near to Gloria Bog, little is happening beyond the everyday syncopations - yet, as ever, McGahern unearths resonant beauty. Gossip is a currency, as always in Ireland, and his dialogue abounds with the juiciness of popular speech. It is his most audaciously structured book, almost completely devoid of plot, suggesting reams about its characters while rarely telling you anything about them. Reading it is like reading everything he wrote - like moving to a place you've never lived in before, where you don't know the neighbours or how things work. But thanks to his artistry, you want to know them. </p> <p>Not long after his death, Creatures of the Earth: New and Selected Stories was published, a sort of correction to the Collected Stories that had appeared to great acclaim in 1992. The later collection is the finest body of short stories published by any Irish writer in recent years, and serves as a moving valediction to the characters McGahern made his own. They drift through these unforgettable and assiduously crafted miniatures like the archetypes of a modern folklore: the inarticulate lover, the distant, damaged father, the ill-used stepmother, the pilgrim between two worlds, the schoolteacher who doubts or despises his vocation, the sufferer of sexual loneliness. Several times we encounter the former student for the Catholic priesthood who abandoned that path on the verge of ordination. Again and again, there is the desperate invitation to marry, usually dismissed or evaded, misunderstood. These are lives marked by abrupt turnings, roads not taken, promises broken, the hopes of childhood crushed, but somehow a faith in the world survives, a notion that redemption is possible.</p>",
  "<p>In the late 1980s, when Richard Price had started to make serious money as a novelist and screenwriter, he moved with his wife and two young daughters into a newly renovated loft apartment in rapidly gentrifying lower Manhattan. All four of his grandparents had arrived in the Lower East Side as immigrants to America in the early years of the century, before fanning out to Brooklyn and the Bronx in the 1920s and 30s. As for many Jewish Americans, the area was part of his childhood mythology and so, when he moved into his new home, Price was keen to show it off to his grandfather. \"So I asked him to come down there,\" he recalls, \"and he really thought I was mocking him. He told me how he'd spent his life trying to get out of this place. And now here was his grandson, his rich, successful, American grandson, paying a huge amount of money to go back.\" </p> <p>The publication next month of Price's eighth novel, Lush Life, marks his long-delayed fictional excavation of the Lower East Side. He says ever since he started out as a novelist he'd wanted to write about the area. His debut, The Wanderers, published in 1974 when he was just 24, drew heavily on his own 1960s Bronx adolescence. With subsequent novels set in and around New York City, he has built a reputation as a supreme exponent of sharp-witted crime stories, delivered in a highly charged prose that casts a light on the lives and motivations of the people who live and work in the murkier corners of inner-city America. </p> <p>The area of lower Manhattan bounded by the East River should have been perfect Price territory. \"But what could I say that was new?\" he shrugs, exuding both a restless nervous energy and laid-back deadpan comic timing. \"It's the most written about place in the world. The first job anyone ever had getting off a boat was as a trouser cutter in a Lower East Side sweatshop. The second job was writing a novel about being a trouser cutter in a Lower East Side sweatshop. The literature could fill a library, but while it was my story, it also wasn't my story, so I sort of left it alone and it has taken me a long time to come back to it.\" </p> <p>Price's own story is an equally strong American archetype. The precocious talent evident from The Wanderers attracted an eclectic group of eminent admirers. William Burroughs declared it a \"deeply moving account of confused and spiritually underprivileged youth\". On this side of the Atlantic, perhaps less predictably, John Fowles claimed not to have read \"a better fictional account of the dark side of the American dream in years\". Price followed up with three more autobiographical books before being enticed to write for Hollywood.</p> <p>At first it seemed Price was following the template of so many great writers - Fitzgerald, Faulkner, Chandler, the list goes on - drowning their talent in a lake of Hollywood excess. His cocaine use got out of hand, he didn't produce a novel for nearly a decade, but he did earn a fortune writing the script for the 16-minute version of Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" video. Looking back, however, it's clear that Price pulled off the trick that Fitzgerald and the rest had so much difficulty with. For a start, he wrote some very good films: Martin Scorsese's Hustler update The Color of Money (1986), for which he received an Oscar nomination; \"Life Lessons\", Scorsese's segment of the 1989 New York Stories trilogy; and the Al Pacino thriller Sea of Love (1989). Still a sought-after screenwriter, he has contributed several episodes of the extravagantly acclaimed crime saga The Wire and is currently adapting Tom Rob Smith's surprise Booker-longlisted thriller, Child 44, for Ridley Scott.</p> <p>And the film money he earned hasn't all been spent on desirable property - although he and his wife, artist Judith Hudson, do live in a large, art-filled townhouse near Gramercy Park, as well as having a place in Montauk on Long Island. He now also has the time, as the theory goes but the practice so often doesn't, to write critically and commercially successful fiction. His \"comeback\" novel was Clockers in 1992, in which he moved his location to Dempsy, a lightly fictionalised Jersey City, as crack cocaine began to infiltrate urban America. James Lee Burke says today that it is still \"probably the best novel written on the dope culture in inner-city America. Price is both an artist and consummate pro.\"</p> <p>Since Clockers, the arrival of a Price novel has become a literary event. When Lush Life was published in America , the New York Times fiction critic Michiko Kakutani opened her review by stating that \"No one writes better dialogue than Richard Price - not Elmore Leonard, not David Mamet, not even [Sopranos creator] David Chase.\" The novelist Michael Chabon effused about a \"descriptive eye as acute as his moral one - for no American writer has ever written with such consistent power as Price on the subject of shame, of the failure of good intentions, of life as lived in the gap between Intention and Act.\"</p> <p>Price says he was prompted to take a closer look at the Lower East Side when his own teenage children began hanging out in its bars and boutiques - \"if you'd said the word 'boutique' to my grandfather, he'd have assumed it was a French word for a whore or something\". But while he knew he would find middle-class kids and the ghosts of his, and their, ancestors, \"I didn't know there were still housing projects filled with black and Hispanic people. Tenements untouched by the rehab craze, orthodox Jews, old hippies who came down in the 60s, and the biggest chunk of undocumented Chinese workers in the country. They live like the Jews did in 1890 with overcrowded rooms, every penny they make going either to the smuggler who brought them in or the family in the old country.\"</p> <p>A story from a cop contact further piqued his interest: after the suicide of a Chinese man, the police went to his address in a \"beat-up tenement on Orchard St\", where they found a luxuriously rehabbed apartment occupied by two young, white middle-class professionals. Then they rang the bell next door. \"And behind the identical fa\u00e7ade were the creaky wooden staircases, the rats running round, and dozens of rooms in which Chinese guys rent a plank of wood as wide as a library shelf on which they sleep. That was the Lower East Side. Worlds literally inches away from each other and yet entirely separate. I wanted to write about how these different groups of people occupy the same physical space, but seem not to even see each other.\"</p> <p>His way into the story was via two highly publicised murders of bar-hopping middle-class kids in muggings that went wrong. \"I was aware that these were very rare events. It's happened twice in 10 years. But when there's a gun, there has to be a conversation. And then the investigation can legitimately enter all the worlds down there to come to a conclusion. It gave me access.\" The primary character, apart from the Lower East Side itself, is Eric Cash, a thirtysomething who still, just, calls himself a writer - he once had a short story published in a now defunct magazine - but actually earns his living by bar work. \"And there, but for the grace of God, go I,\" says Price. \"If I hadn't got published at 24, I really don't know whether I would have stuck at it into my 30s. I was the first college graduate in my family, and the last thing they would have understood was their child saying I want to be a dancer. Would I have stuck at telemarketing or driving a cab to support my writing habit while my Cornell friends were lawyers? I really don't know. Thank God it's hypothetical.\"</p> <p>Price was born in the Bronx in 1949 and grew up in a \"blue-collar, racially mixed, punch-on-the-nose-at-worst housing project. Just as the Lower East Side was a starter kit for the new world, so public housing was a starter kit for a respectable working-class life. It was affordable rents for not-so-bad apartments, so people spent all their money on getting the next generation to college. And it worked pretty well as a launching pad until well into the 1960s, when for many reasons the projects stopped being seen as a step up.\"</p> <p>There were books at home and a certain respect for literature. His factory-worker grandfather wrote poems in Russian Yiddish that Price would see in pamphlets from the Young Men's Hebrew Association. \"I remember being a kid in his house in Brooklyn and seeing his name at the end of a poem, which I knew was a poem only because the lines seemed to end arbitrarily. And I saw my father looking at his father with real reverence. Writing was something I wanted to do.\"</p> <p>Price won a place at Cornell - \"some parts of Cornell are easier to get into than others\" - where he studied labour relations. \"I didn't give a damn about any of it, but in retrospect I'm glad I wasn't an English major. Spending all day talking about Tolstoy and then going home to write your 19-year-old crap - it would be demoralising.\" After graduating he applied to seven writing programmes and was rejected by six. \"My parents had a hosiery store in the Bronx. They wanted me to go to law school or anywhere that my degree would end in a job interview. And there was I Hamlet-ing around saying I don't know what to do. Finally my father said 'go to your goddamn writing programme. If it doesn't work out you can go to law school.\" It worked out. \"When I published The Wanderers, the only other 24-year-old to publish a novel was Martin Amis with The Rachel Papers. The median age for a first-time novelist in America was about 40. Which made far more sense. At least they had a life to write about.\"</p> <p>In fact, Price's life so far provided plenty of material, and he says he wrote the book knowing he \"had moved on and my Bronx existed only in as much as I could remember it. I had this real urge to crystallise it and keep it from evaporating.\" Chabon described the book as \"a loose-knit Bronx myth cycle . . . that reads like a bunch of twice-told tales honed and crafted to wow upstaters\" and includes a blend of \"the preposterous with deadeye detail\". Price acknowledges, despite many critics insisting on his documentary verisimilitude, an attempt to produce a heightened style. \"I wanted to capture the tone of a group of friends getting together 15 years after the event, having a drink and saying 'remember when'. Everything was a little more linear than it actually was, a little more exaggerated and a little more heroic.\"</p> <p>Of all the overwhelmingly positive responses, the most gratifying for Price came from Hubert Selby Jr in the New York Times, who praised a \"superbly written book\" and Price as someone who \"respects his art and his subject, and illuminates our daily world with insights that allow us - at times force us - to feel closer to other human beings whether we like and approve of them or not\". </p> <p>Coming across Selby's Last Exit to Brooklyn in his late teens was the most important literary discovery of Price's life. \"It was the first time I'd read a book with concrete in it. I'd read and enjoyed Dickens and Steinbeck, Shakespeare, Jane Austen and the rest of the public-school canon. But I couldn't place myself in any of it. My childhood was a lot less dire than Selby's world of pill-heads and junkies and transvestites and working-class guys going on strike. But I heard every voice in the book as if they were standing next to me. I actually called him up to say thank you and he picked up the phone and spoke in this high-pitched nasal Brooklyn voice which came as a shock to me. I don't know why I thought he might speak like Sir John Gielgud.\" </p> <p>Price followed up his debut with three more autobiographical novels before finding himself, aged just 32, having \"written about my life up to last night. And I'd become bored with myself.\" So he took up some of the increasingly frequent offers to write screenplays. \"Even at best,\" he says, \"it's like being the mechanical draughtsman rather than the architect of a building.\" Yet \"the good thing about that period was that I continued to write, I made money and it forced me out of autobiography. I learned that I could go to other places and you're not required by law to write about the place you grew up in, or what creeps your parents were, or how great your parents were.\"</p> <p>Clockers led to two more Dempsy novels, Freedomland (1998), in which racial tensions skew the search for a missing child, and Samaritan (2003), about a TV scriptwriter volunteering to teach at an inner-city school, as Price has done. Clockers also, indirectly, led to The Wire, with Price's friend and Wire creator David Simon citing it as a prime source for his much-acclaimed series. When Simon asked him to write some episodes, Price was at first daunted. \"Something like Clockers doesn't go above ground level. It was all about front-line troops, junkies and cops. These Wire guys took it right up to City Hall and corrupt congressmen. That hadn't been what I did.\"</p> <p>Price is adamant about the status of his work as fiction - not documentary or journalism - and says he retains the view that \"if you want to send a message, go to Western Union\". But he does admit to having some wider social purpose in his treatment of the Lower East Side in Lush Life. As Simon has noted, there were more murders on the Law &amp; Order TV shows last year than there were real murders in Manhattan. The Lower East Side in particular has been utterly transformed in a generation.</p> <p>\"And now many people in New York seem to be nostalgic for places that looked like shit-holes. Do I want lines of heroin addicts queuing round the block? No. But I did want to deal with the fact that real estate is violence. You have a neighbourhood that has been a certain way and then somebody makes a cappuccino. The realtors smell that and it becomes a gold mine. A lot of people are uprooted and for every person who gets in the papers for committing a crime, there are 25 people who never did anything wrong in their lives. The thing I really relate to is the changing character of the place. The Lower East Side is now nearly like everywhere else. I know this could sound very liberal and sentimental, but it really isn't about 'poor people good', 'rich people bad'. It's just that a bit of history has been lost.\"</p> <h2>Price on Price</h2> <p>\"Restless, they finally pull out to honeycomb the narrow streets for an hour of endless tight right turns: falafel joint, jazz joint, gyro joint, corner. Schoolyard, cr\u00eaperie, realtor, corner. Tenement, tenement, tenement museum, corner. Pink Pony, Blind Tiger, muffin boutique, corner. Sex shop, tea shop, synagogue, corner. Boulangerie, bar, hat boutique, corner. Iglesia, gelateria, matzo shop, corner. Bollywood, Buddha, botanica, corner. Leather outlet, leather outlet, leather outlet, corner. Bar, school, bar, school, People's Park, corner. Tyson mural, Celia Cruz mural, Lady Di mural, corner. Bling shop, barbershop, car service, corner. And then finally, on a sooty stretch of Eldridge, something with potential: a weary-faced Fujianese in a thin Members Only windbreaker, cigarette hanging, plastic bags dangling from crooked fingers like full waterbuckets, trudging up the dark, narrow street followed by a limping black kid half a block behind.\"</p> <p>I actually don't like to write so I have to work myself up. This was me trying to get something going about these cops riding round the Lower East Side in a bogus taxi. I wanted this quality of them making right turn after right turn for hours on end all night, so I started this incantatory chant of the properties they were passing. And reading it back it seemed to say something about what this place was and what it had once been. Sometimes you have to jump up and down on a motorcycle pedal 10 times. This was the moment when it caught and it became like an overture to the book.</p>",
  "<p>A hot midday on a hillside overlooking Ramallah, a blue sky with some bashful, short-lived clouds and Palestinian flags everywhere, side by side with his photo - and the voice of Mahmoud Darwish reciting his own poetry came pure and powerful through the huge loudspeakers and covered the whole landscape. In the middle of the courtyard of Ramallah's Cultural Palace, where he'd given his last poetry reading a few weeks ago (at which he read \"The Dice Player\"), the empty grave was waiting for the body of the poet. The roads up the hill carried wave after wave of people of all ages and affiliations, all trying hard to get as close as possible to the grave to say goodbye to their poet. As the coffin was lowered into the ground, a small regiment of Palestinian security officers had to restrain a crowd struggling to look at the grave, and another fired 21 shots in salute. </p> <p>We circled around the grave, and I found myself next to his mother, Houria, aged 92 - who was brought from Galilee in an ambulance and brought on a wheelchair to have a last glance at her boy, whose most famous line is \"I yearn for my mother's bread and my mother's coffee\" - and his two brothers, Ahmad and Zaki. I saw his sisters only after the ceremony was over. The family was almost apologetic for their presence among those thousands of mourners; his mother, in her feeble, broken voice, said: \"He is the son of all of you.\" This was the first time I had seen his mother. She does not travel, and I am not allowed to go to Galilee.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, just before 10am, Darwish's body arrived on a flight from the United States in Amman, Jordan. After a short ceremony the casket was loaded on to a Jordanian military helicopter, which flew to Ramallah, landing at noon. Far from Ramallah, a procession left the Ahihud junction, east of Acre, heading towards the former village of Al-Birweh, where Darwish was born. A symbolic funeral was held there, as youths recited Darwish's poems. What an embarrassment to those who accuse the Palestinians of all sorts of evil. Now you have thousands and thousands of Palestinians with poems and roses in their hands, going out to honour a poet whose lines are full of butterflies, doves, bees, ancient mythology and biblical allusions. They are out for beautiful verse, and that's it. This is praise for them and also for their poet, who proved to them only through his aesthetic experiments the value of art and its charms. Those are the same people who filled halls and theatres and auditoriums to listen to him. Many more people like them in most of the Arab countries were no less enthusiastic. In 2002, an audience of 25,000 Lebanese and Palestinians living in the refugee camps of Lebanon filled a football stadium in Beirut to listen for three hours to his fascinating words. Occupation and dictatorship do everything possible to suppress their victims' desire for any kind of self-expression. But the victims do express themselves: they do it politically, through acts of resistance, and culturally, through songs, folk dances, handicrafts, memoirs and poems. By self-expression they achieve self-assertion, and this makes them stronger and guards them against self-pity and sentimentality. This explains the precious unwritten contract between Palestinian and Arab writers, as masters of expression, and their audience.</p> <p>Darwish gave them this without sacrificing his self-imposed aesthetic ambitions and rules. I think it is safe to say that this is what distinguished him among Arab poets. But Darwish did not come out of nowhere, and his absence will not be the end of excellent Palestinian poetry. This land needs its poets and will always have them.</p> <p>Long ago Darwish had walked out of professional politics, out of his literary quarterly Al Karmil, out of two very brief, almost unpublicised, childless marriages. From August 9 2008, Mahmoud, as we used to call him, will live among us as pure poetry, exactly as he'd always wished.</p> <p>I phoned him from Cairo just before what turned out to be his final trip, and he told me he knew the risks of failed surgery in his case: paralysis or death. \"I can accept death,\" he said. Now his famous shyness will not prevent him from accepting our invitation to stay with us a bit longer; he will walk freely in our reading hours and our bedrooms. </p> <p>The story of the Palestinian people since their nakba is a story of unfulfilled desires: the desire for normal life, for justice, for national independence and freedom, but even Mahmoud had to come to this cheerless conclusion: \"I thought poetry could change everything, could change history and could humanise, and I think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe. But now I think that poetry changes only the poet.\"</p> <p>This time he was wrong. This man's poetry has changed the language of Arabic writing and shifted readers' conceptions of resistance poetry. The drums receded to give way to the harp and the flute. Single-coloured khaki poems full of slogans gave way to rainbow-intertwined shades. Even the physical image of the victimised and the oppressed had to give way to Mahmoud's unmatched elegance in dress and in daily conversation alike.</p> <p>As a poet, he had that overwhelming presence of an elderly figure, while as a person he was like the beloved youngest son in the family, a polite and vulnerable grandson, for whom you are tempted to do anything to protect him from harm. In this world of polluted international political language, where the word \"freedom\" is abused in every manner, referring to everything from capitalism to the occupation of Iraq, Mahmoud's poetry and life were an attempt to give it back its meaning. This was his destiny because he was a poet, and also because he was an Arab and a Palestinian. </p> <p>Born in Al-Birweh, a Palestinian village in northern Galilee that was completely destroyed by the Zionist militias that built the state of Israel in 1948, he fled the country with his family, only to return in secret to live in an adjacent Arab village that had escaped destruction. Like those Arab Palestinians who stayed in the state of Israel, he lived under military rule, confiscation of lands and constraints on movement until 1966. He therefore joined the only non-Zionist political party in Israel, the Israeli Communist party. For many Arabs, their class and national identities were congruent; they were poor and oppressed, because they were Arabs. </p> <p>Belonging to a political party, however, brings its own constraints. The choice offered to Mahmoud, like that historically offered to many of his people, is a choice between shackles and shackles: a choice between the shackles of occupation and the shackles of resisting it. In the early 1970s he decided to leave. He went to Egypt and then to Lebanon. In a press conference in Cairo, he said: \"I changed my place, but not my position.\" He left Palestine, to join the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p>Here is another paradox that Mahmoud shares with his people: in the Arab world, Palestinians are in exile, but they are not strangers. Mahmoud's life in Egypt, and later in Lebanon, was not a disconnection from Palestine - rather, it made him more of a pan-Arab poet, which in turn made him more of a Palestinian one. </p> <p>Mahmoud was at the centre of Arab culture in the 20th century because he was a poet, and a Palestinian. Poetry lies at the centre of all Arab arts, and Palestine at the centre of Arab collective consciousness. A poem about Palestine was therefore a poem to all Arabs.</p> <p>Among the many arts that the Arabs have produced without interruption over 15 centuries of their history, poetry is still the most celebrated. Arab cultural identity revolves around language. The eloquence of the Qur'an was the proof of its divinity. The beauty of a line of poetry turned it into a proverb with all the moral authority of law or tradition. The role of poetry in creating collective identity among Arabs is well known. It is no coincidence that the prophet of the Arabs was called by some a poet, and that three centuries later Al-Mutanabbi, the greatest poet in medieval Arab history, called himself a prophet.</p> <p>Among the Palestinians this passion for poetry is heightened, because their collective identity is negated by their enemies and the rulers of the world. Poetry becomes a means of collective self-expression and hence of collective self-assertion. As such, it is safe to say that Mahmoud's poetry was never dissociated from Palestine and the Palestinian struggle for freedom. However, being an Arab Palestinian poet made him a spokesman for the Palestinian and Arab struggles for freedom, and that in itself was a heavier constraint on his freedom of writing and style.</p> <p>Mahmoud's later poetry was a continuous attempt to break free from the shackle-like crown bestowed on him by his people. Nonetheless, in his writing, these intentional attempts to make the struggle absent only made it all the more present, for one cannot intend to forget without remembering the very thing that one wants to forget.</p> <p>The paradoxical tension between freedom and its shackles was reflected in Mahmoud's relations with his friends, foes and political authority. He was close to the Palestinian leadership, whether in the phase of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority after Oslo. Nonetheless, he maintained a distance. Palestine had chosen his comrades for him, and he did not always like the choice. He once told me that, were it not for \"the struggle\", \"I would not have returned a good morning to many of those who now say they are my friends\". </p> <p>Like a kind of scientist, Mahmoud spent his life concocting Palestinian national identity, though its links to the land, and to the Arabic language and culture, were established long before him. In his poetry he tried to link that identity to a humanist global culture, to pre-Arab and pre-Islamic cultures of the Middle East, and to those details of human life that are beautiful in any culture or place. In doing so, he was not only asserting the humanity of the Palestinians, so often denied by Zionist discourse, but he was also humanising humanism to his people. To them and to Arabs, humanism was the discourse of a colonial invader who spoke about freedom and human rights, but gave them the state of Israel and military occupation and the prison at Abu Ghraib. In his poetry Mahmoud was trying to strengthen the ever-thinning thread between the Arabs and western culture, of which they have had very bad experiences. Already entrenched in his Arab culture and language, he started visiting other traditions in writing, style and content.</p> <p>It was certainly a sad moment on the hillside overlooking the city of Ramallah, just 16km from the prohibited Jerusalem, suffocated by the apartheid wall and military checkpoints. It was even a tragic moment for Mahmoud Darwish to die, leaving his people in this unprecedented vulnerability caused by the mistakes of their political leadership and the bloody and absurd fratricidal divisions that have emerged between the leading Palestinian factions over an illusory and ridiculous power. The nationwide grief for the loss of Mahmoud is partly a grass-roots protest against those worthless politicians on both sides of the divide. </p> <p>Darwish's complex legacy cannot be understood without reference to the political role he played, or was persuaded to play, however short or interrupted that was, but it would always be wise to place it in the context of the wider Palestinian question, which only becomes more complicated as time goes by, instead of reaching a just solution. On the hillside overlooking Ramallah, the Palestinian leadership intended to stage a funeral for a member of the PLO, while the people, who came out in their thousands with lines of his poems in their hands and on their shirts, and who were continuing a line of verse before he'd finished reading it, made it a poet's funeral. Mahmoud Darwish had once been a member of the PLO executive committee, but he resigned a very long time ago, and he finally emerged as one of the great Arab poets of modern times. The PLO wanted to celebrate his past. People celebrated his future. They were sure, and I am sure, that a real poet is one who never takes his future with him when he is laid to rest.</p> <h2> from The Dice Player</h2> <p>. . .

  "<p><strong>Jill Tunstall, 46</strong><br>Cards on the table? I've always felt that today's parents are a pampered breed. Legislation for this, time off for that, allocated parking spaces in Tesco ... I mean, how hard can it be? </p> <p>I arrive, after leaving two pages of detailed notes about my cat, my house and my library books, to find Alice halfway out of the door. \"Hero needs to be at her music lesson in an hour and she'd like her hair cut,\" are the only two instructions I get before she leaves with almost indecent haste.</p> <p>Suddenly, I am in charge of two kids, a huge B&amp;B, 15 guests (not the eight I was promised), an alsatian, two cats, three chickens and a hamster.</p> <p>It couldn't be further from my own life. At 46, and by choice, I live and work alone in a modest house on the North Wales coast, my only responsibilities a mortgage and an elderly cat. Instead of assuming more responsibilities with age, I am living the life of a carefree thirtysomething.</p> <p>Yet here I am in charge of what could, potentially, become the domestic version of the Titanic during my captaincy.</p> <p>But there is no time to contemplate my incarceration as I realise that we need to get cracking to make the music lesson. \"Get your shoes on,\" I instruct the children. Ten minutes later, I discover that neither has taken a bit of notice. </p> <p>We finally get there - 10 minutes late - and I realise Tybalt is wearing his mother's walking boots and two pairs of trousers. While his sister Hero, nine, performs her scales, I take Tybalt, my godson, to the outdoor shop. He wants everything, especially penknives. We leave with a pair of slippers, three sizes too big, that he insists he will grow into. </p> <p>An hour in and I'm already the victim of pester power. I've earned a coffee, I reckon, and head for a cafe where I tell the children to grab the sofas. Tybalt orders a chocolate cone with double choc-chip chocolate ice cream, a chocolate flake and a fudge stick. As I hand it to him, Hero tells me Tybalt sometimes has to go to his bedroom when he has too much chocolate. </p> <p>Later - at the end of the swap and by then far too late - I also discover that shandy with their pub supper, lemonade with breakfast and coffee at any time are also not allowed. </p> <p>I get them home and realise the chicken won't be cooked until 8pm - their bedtime. I bang it in the oven as the children start chasing each other round and round the kitchen in a sugar-fuelled frenzy. Just as I begin to get really, really tired of it all, they stop squabbling and agree to peel and chop the carrots. I feel like Supernanny. </p> <p>I wake at 7am to the full horror of having to meet and greet 15 people, plus get the children ready for the day. How? </p> <p>If I started every day like this I'd have a nervous breakdown within a week. In my life it begins about 9am with coffee and newspapers. </p> <p>Then Hero arrives in the middle of breakfast in her pyjamas demanding that I straighten her hair, the toilet blocks and, as I pull on rubber gloves, the cat brings a dead mouse into the breakfast room.</p> <p>\"Are you really 52?\" asks Tybalt. No, I'm really not but I feel much, much older right at this minute, I tell him. And, I wonder, how does Alice manage this on a day-to-day basis, let alone with PMT, flu or a broken heart? I try to book the children into a skiing session so that I can tackle the B&amp;B ironing but the children scream so much I cannot hear a thing. I scream back: \"Shut up!\"</p> <p>Their eyes pop out on stalks but my position of supremacy crumbles when two B&amp;B guests walk in and I have to apologise.</p> <p>I fall into bed each night without a shower or a proper meal, and not realising that the children haven't washed, cleaned their teeth or done their homework. I'm craving solitude or a full-on night out with adults who speak my language. And my maternal instinct is as dormant as ever.</p> <p>Days later Alice returns with blow-dried hair, San Tropez tan, red dress and heels. I want to cry. I am in a tea-stained T-shirt and have just spent an hour mopping floors. \"That's how I feel when you turn up looking glamorous,\" she confides, which makes me feel quite guilty.</p> <p>But at least I'm finally free again. I say goodbye to the kids, who seem rather relieved to have their mother back, and drive away, stopping at a cafe to relish the freedom of not having to think for anybody else.</p> <p>I feel a small stab of pride at having survived Alice's life. Strangely though, the chairs opposite me do seem sadly empty and I find myself wondering if I will have anyone to mourn me when I'm gone, especially as the Tunstall line ends with me.</p> <p>Why is that important, I muse? When I'm gone, I'm gone. And then it occurs to me that all this lineage stuff is just an emotional burden heaped on women over the years to keep them busy bearing children.</p> <p>My child-free state was never a decision I took. I just never wanted them. I used to wonder whether I'd wake up one day with the over- whelming urge to create new life that other women, including my sisters, talk about - but it never happened. </p> <p>Recently it cost me a long-term relationship with my partner.</p> <p>So there was no epiphany after being at Alice's, just a realisation of what it takes if your hormones do tell you that you cannot live without children. </p> <p>Oh, and a grudging concession that, OK, maybe those supermarket parking spaces are deserved, after all. I may have a bit further to walk in the rain but, having seen the alternative, I'll take that any day of the week ...</p> <p><strong>Alice Douglas, 43</strong><br>Jill is my childless best friend. All overworked, over-achieving mothers have a childless best friend. They serve, for the mother, a dual role. On the one hand they allow us to pretend that we would be as well-dressed, well-organised, healthy, thin, successful and independent, not to mention politically informed, as they are, were it not for the fact that we are mothers. </p> <p>On the other, when we are feeling in need of some reassurance that our lives are not simply a round of spare tyres, sleeplessness and dirty hair, we can flip things over and affirm ourselves by feeling sorry for them because they haven't got children. (This works despite the fact that I know that Jill never wanted kids in the first place.)</p> <p>Even Jill's front door is calm. Not like mine, scuffed in mud from being kicked in impatience by my children as I fumble to open it. This front door is battle-scar free, spotless. I open it slowly, fearful of spoiling its pristine facade, but not slowly enough to stop Flinty, the decrepit cat, from making her getaway. </p> <p>The next thing to greet me is a tidy hallway. As if to offer a taste of the shocking comparisons to come, the image of my own front porch flashes before me. I have always dreamed of a tidy porch like this. But then I'd have to sort the hundreds of pairs of out-grown, scuffed shoes and bits of mud-splattered kit - and who knows what horrors lurk beneath.</p> <p>I tried to pacify myself. Smugness usually works, I thought. My porch-way is, after all, the stuff of life, of living - a full life. A life of children. Poor Jill, I think, smiling Madonna-like to myself.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Jill has been a patient observer for years, I have played down the chaos that is my life. The last thing I want is for her to pull the rug on my first opportunity for peace and order in nine years.</p> <p>For my part, I am looking at a glorious spell off the treadmill. Bliss. I won't even go into the deal that Jill is staring in the face.</p> <p>I slump on the sofa and stare at the order around me. I breathe a relaxed sigh. Then it begins. Solitude. Terror of my youth. I hoick up Flinty, the cat, against her will, on to the sofa beside me and begin to stroke her frantically. </p> <p>It is a little like a phobia, this long-lost enemy. Before, I was always afraid when my life wasn't filled to the brim, but I had so many fears in those days that life was one long round of running away from them. I thought that children had cured that, but now sitting alone in the delicious tranquillity of Jill's house I begin to ask myself whether, in fact, I hadn't been running all the time. How would I now cope with being forced to stop and smell the roses? Flinty, I think, Flinty will be my friend.</p> <p>I also turn to my most reliable form of diversion from complicated thoughts and started to feel peckish. As mothers know, when all else fails, eat. I decide to check out the kitchen. </p> <p>The first thing I find (and the guilt, bearing in mind that I have left nothing for Jill, is acute) are two pages of meticulous instructions. How to water the plants, how to feed the cat, how to take a library book back. That will certainly be a new experience. I shall very much enjoy the gentle five-minute walk to the library, unencumbered by children and shopping. Yes, this library book will certainly go back.</p> <p>The next thing I find - to my utter dismay - is that apart from a jar of gherkins, half a packet of oatcakes and a tin of olives, the cupboard is, as they say, absolutely bare. Jill told me later that she thought that I would enjoy the pleasure of shopping alone, for just me. The thought doesn't even occur to me. It's not that I don't know how to shop - after all, shopping in our house is usually a two-trolley, \u00a3400 affair. It's just that left with the thought of \"just me\" I am utterly lost. Thank goodness for the booze! </p> <p>As I climb up the stairs with a glass of white wine and my little plate of titbits I start to worry. How will Jill cope? What if she forgets to lock the doors or the place catches fire? What if she doesn't shut up the chickens for the night or check that we have enough sausages for breakfast? How will she manage 15 B&amp;B guests? </p> <p>Then I miss my children and the guilt starts. </p> <p>But then I remember Jill, who she is. She will cope, of course, and we will laugh about it. And life opens up. It's amazing how the hours pass with a glass of wine, a bit of peace and a telephone. And then there is Jill's fantastic library. I'll be able to read more than 10 lines without falling asleep. Perhaps solitude isn't so bad.</p> <p>In the morning, the number nine etches itself out before my eyes on the digital clock - 9am, a full 14 hours sleep. Oh, joy! </p> <p>Putting on Jill's Mindfulness CD, I gently saunter to my breakfast and to Desert Island Discs on Radio 4. This can't be true. The whole programme uninterrupted. </p> <p>The days follow serenely. I hum to myself as I water plants. I even tell my son Tybalt to stop ringing all the time. Over-anxious Mum seems to have gone on holiday too. Perhaps I realise that I might just as well worry about the sky falling down or the planet spinning off its axis as worry about the kids incessantly. </p> <p>Experiencing Jill's environment showed me that she lives her life, while my life lives me. She chose her child-free state for well thought out reasons, while I jumped into my fantasy of a big family and a welter of people coming and going without a shadow of deliberation. </p> <p>This life swap experience forced me to deal with the present in a way I never do. I usually have no time to savour the moment because I am too busy preparing for the one to come. I have promised myself that I'm going to take better care of myself. More aromatherapy baths, less toxic food. More sauvignon blanc. And more books. Jill has such lovely books.</p>",
  "<p>The world swirls all around him, but Martin Lawrence seems strangely trapped in space and time. We hardly notice any more but, yes, he still makes movies. Indeed, College Road Trip is his second comedy this year after Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins, both of which I very kindly watched so that you wouldn't have to (and, yeah, I think I do deserve a medal). </p> <p>But whatever I think, his movies somehow make depressingly high sums anyway, given the disputable quality of what he's selling us. But how did it come to this? Lawrence has at various points in his career fallen into the orbit of nearly every major figure in the highest circles of African-American Hollywood, either receiving from them the baton of comedy genius (only to fumble it with another crappy sex comedy or naff interracial action movie) or handing it on to younger performers eager to make something of the opportunity. Lawrence certainly has a raw, natural talent - I can attest to his having made me laugh on, ooh, several occasions - but what has he ever done with it? </p> <p>Lawrence was in at the dawn of the New Black Cinema of the late-80s, when Spike Lee and others finally - finally! - won a measure of access for African-American artists in Hollywood. He had roles in Lee's Do The Right Thing and in the box-office smash House Party. In Boomerang he was second male lead to Eddie Murphy, his idol, a sure sign that he was on the way to the top.</p> <p>Thus he found himself in Bad Boys alongside Will Smith, whose TV-launched career ran parallel to Martin's for a while. </p> <p>The Fresh Prince turned himself first into a superstar, then into a global brand, and thence into the box-office phenomenon known as Mr July The Fourth. Martin Lawrence, meanwhile, went nuts, being at various times found waving loaded guns around in public places while raving incoherently, marrying Miss Virginia for a nanosecond, making sexist jokes that got him banned from Saturday Night Live for life, or being accused of sexually harassing co-star Tisha Campbell on his sitcom Martin. He later claimed he'd been smoking too much pot - which any pothead will tell you is, like, totally bogus, bro! </p> <p>Since his recovery, Lawrence has hacked his way through Blue Streak, Black Knight, Rebound, the Big Momma movies and other dross, while being utterly outpaced. He's now cannibalising the work of his more industrious imitators: the Dave Chappelles, Chris Rocks and Bernie Macs (RIP) who went on to better, funnier projects of their own. College Road Trip, however, is little more than his retread of Are We There Yet? (in which Ice Cube did an eighth-rate Steve Martin retread), while Roscoe Jenkins is a witless stab at the hit formula patented by black cinema's latest poster boy, Tyler Perry. </p> <p>In fact, all his most successful movies are like embarrassing entries from other people's mid-career slumps. </p> <p>Me, I've stopped waiting for The Real Martin Lawrence to stand up. Now I'd just like him to shut up.</p>",
  "<p>Paula Radcliffe will wake up at 3.30am tomorrow here to seek redemption with the Olympic Games. It is a love affair that has lasted for 24 years and six days. It began with tears, and the last instalment ended the same way. What lies ahead is anyone's guess, but set your clocks for the drama - just as a budding 10-year-old Bedford runner did on August 11, 1984 when she rose in the middle of the night to watch the 3,000 metres from Los Angeles, the classic duel between Mary Decker and Zola Budd.</p> <p>\"My first Olympic memory is that race,\" says Radcliffe. \"I sat on my mum and dad's bed. They had a small television and I remember going in to see it.\" A quick resum\u00e9: Budd, the controversial South Africa-born Briton, was blamed for tripping the American heroine Decker and sending her spinning off the track and into the arms of her husband, who carried her away as she cried her eyes out. </p> <p>The last the Olympic Games saw of Radcliffe was in a similar vein. Four years ago, with three miles left of the marathon on a day of unbearable heat in Athens, the world record-holder could go on no longer. Infamously, she stopped. She sat on a kerb. She could not control her emotions. Everything that she had spent a career working towards had come to a halt on that Sunday afternoon on the most famous course of all. </p> <p>When Radcliffe takes to the start line tomorrow in Beijing - a miracle in itself, as only 12 weeks ago leading medical opinion said it would be a mission impossible because of the stress fracture of her left femur - she will not be thinking back to 2004. But maybe 1984. Not to that specific race between Decker and Budd, but to the hold the Games has had on her. She arrives here with only one race in nine months and with only one week of proper running in three months. If this was the world championships she would be a spectator.</p> <p>\"I could have done with more time when your biggest week of running is two weeks before the race,\" says Radcliffe, 34. \"It's not an ideal preparation and it's not what you would risk going into any other race. But the Olympic Games is not a race I ever want to watch on television and think what I could have done in there. I've seen all the Coe-Ovett races from 1980. It is not about a particular race but the whole aura and ethos of the Olympics.\" </p> <p>This will be the fourth time Radcliffe has run at the Games. In 1996, as a relative unknown, she finished fifth in the 5,000m final and in Sydney in 2000 she was fourth in the 10,000m after leading almost all the way. And then there was Athens. </p> <p>An unkind friend, the Olympics, to a woman who has held the lure of this greatest sporting gathering so close to her heart. But this time, whatever happens, will she finish come what may? When she stopped in Athens, she came in for serious criticism for the only time in her career. \"I could not run any further when I got to where I got to in Athens,\" she says. \"If I had run an absolutely perfect race, it would not have been any different. That is the problem. I was ill going into it.</p> <p>\"This year I am in a better situation than in Athens because I am healthy. I was not healthy going into it there. I did a lot more training and I was in better shape. Two weeks before that race in Athens, I was in outstanding shape, but it did not work out on the day.</p> <p>\"I know it's going to be tough and I am going to fight harder than I have ever fought, but I am looking forward to it. I have fought harder than ever to get to this point, so I just want to go in there and do everyone justice. There has always been a big support team around me but this time there has been hundreds of people really weighing in to help get me here.\"</p> <p>Radcliffe's last race was her victory in the New York marathon in November. It was another stirring, edge-of-the-seat performance when she held off the challenge of Gete Wami, her long-time Ethiopian rival. Wami will be back tomorrow, as will her team-mate Berhane Adere, the Kenyan world champion Catherine Ndereba, and Chunxiu Zhou, of China, who won the 2007 London marathon.</p> <p>The weather is the other opponent. Yesterday in Beijing was the clearest day since the Games began and there was not a hint of smog. Even with the race starting at 7.30am, four hours after Radcliffe's alarm call, it will be hot. But the type of rain seen over the past few days could work in her favour, and might even prompt her to charge away. The Briton has held the world record of 2hr 15min 25sec since 2003, but no Olympic women's marathon has been won quicker than when Naoko Takahashi of Japan, in Sydney, clocked 2:23:14. </p> <p>Radcliffe has been preparing at the British Olympic Association's camp in Macau, near Hong Kong, since the start of last week, but since May the majority of her training has been on a ski-machine or in the pool. She did not add up the miles she ran last week.</p> <p>\"I have generally adapted to the humidity,\" she says. \"If you are not in the race, you cannot win the race, but by getting myself to this point I have put myself in as good a position as I could have done. If I look back over the last 12 weeks, I don't think there was any point where I could have done any more.\" </p> <p>It should be fascinating and thrilling. No one knows if Radcliffe's leg will hold up, but she is such a fighter that victory cannot be ruled out, a result that would surely eclipse any other British gold at these Olympics. \"I am glad I pushed it at every opportunity, but in the time limit it was really hard and [just] having got this far gives me a mental lift going into the race,\" she says.</p> <p>\"It's important for me to go out there and run well, but I do not think it's the defining moment of my career. There have been other things in my career which will define it, hopefully there are other things I am going on to achieve.\" But they do not come bigger than the Olympic Games. If they did, you would not get up in the middle of the night to watch them.</p> <h2>Paula's highs and lows</h2> <p><strong>1992</strong></p> <p><strong>Junior champion</strong></p> <p>Radcliffe shows her potential when she wins the junior title at the world cross-country championships in Boston, but the foot injury that sidelines her throughout the 1994 season offers a warning of her frailty</p> <p><strong>1996</strong></p> <p><strong>A bigger stage</strong></p> <p>Makes her Olympic debut in Atlanta, coming fifth in the 5,000m.

  "<p>Britain's Ben Ainslie and the new Yngling blondes - Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb, and Pippa Wilson - maintained their gold medal position after the penultimate day's sailing here in Fushan Bay and guaranteed themselves silver medals at least. All that remains is this morning's last medal race when the points count double, and both Ainslie, on the verge of his third Olympic gold, and Pippa Wilson exuded quiet confidence born of a series of outstanding races here.</p> <p>Ainslie, the most formidable dinghy racer of his generation, and perhaps any other generation, is poised to become Britain's most celebrated Olympic sailor, a position previously held by Rodney Pattison who won two golds and a silver in the Flying Dutchman class at the Mexico, Munich, and Montreal Olympics. Ainslie currently has two golds and a silver.</p> <p>His only rival in the final race is the American Zach Railey whom Ainslie will be watching like a hawk. In the last but one race Ainslie finished second, while Railey, towards the back of the fleet, simply made sure he stayed ahead of the Frenchman Guillaume Florent to preserve his silver medal position. \"I still have a shot at the gold,\" said Railey, but nobody much believed him. Ainslie is a tactical genius, and will weigh up every option down to the very last puff of wind. \"Ben is one of the best dinghy sailors ever,\" admitted the American.</p> <p>Ainslie was not prepared to concede that the gold medal was there for him on a plate. \"The job is only half done. You can never have enough points for the lead, and I'm hoping for a good breeze. I will stick to Zach like glue, and I don't have to worry about a third sailor. \"</p> <p>Essentially Ainslie could sail a tactically defensive race, simply making sure that not too many boats get between him and the American and such is the <br>British sailor's tactical acumen that nobody doubts that he will. Conversely, nobody would be the least surprised if he sailed away into the far blue yonder.</p> <p>\"You try and get out in front, but it's all about doing everything well. The match racing I have had before in the America's Cup will help, but these medal races can quite often kick up something up,\" said Ainslie, who is never averse to putting the boot in if necessary. \"The pressure is certainly not off, I wish it was. I just have to keep my head screwed on.\" </p> <p>The fact that Railey, who has sailed out of his skin here, chose to defend his silver medal position, on another day of shifting winds and cancelled races, seemed to point to the fact that he had all but given up on any chances of striking gold, although Ainslie would be the last to take anything for granted.</p> <p>Britain, with Shirley Robertson at the helm, won the inaugural Yngling gold in Athens, and this time Ayton is poised to repeat the golden moment, this time at the tiller herself. In their penultimate race the three women sailors finished fifth, and the race for gold, given that they start and finish cleanly, will be between them and the Dutch trio who won yesterday's race.</p> <p>\"We had always prepared for a close final race, but it's going to be tough,\" said Wilson, who has joined the boat since Athens. \"I'm very lucky to be sailing with them, and we all see things the same way. It's always been about coming home with the gold.\" She admitted that they had made a wrong selection on sail size yesterday, with the wind not as strong as they had expected. \"But we hung in. Obviously we will all have a few butterflies in the final race, but we know we have to beat the Dutch.\"</p> <p>Paul Goodison claimed victory in the only race of the day in the Laser class to move to the top of the standings, level on 33 points with Rasmus Myrgren after four races. The 30-year-old took the lead in the third leg and never looked back, finishing 84 seconds ahead of the Swede.</p>",
  "<p>I've just been watching coverage of the Olympic dressage and I must say I'm absolutely baffled. In case you haven't seen it, let me explain what happens: people dressed in a sort of funereal version of fox-hunting gear take it in turns to go into a large sandy arena riding horses that seem to have been driven mad. The horses behave like the deranged dancing bears in those charity adverts, doing weird fidgety fastidious things that clearly aren't natural to them: they hop from foot to foot, they walk on the spot, they stand still for a bit, quivering, before turning round in awkward timorous circles and walking diagonally across the arena.</p> <p>Quite what treatment these creatures have been put through to get them to be this odd I dread to think, but it gets stranger: sometimes the horse and rider's obsessive antics are condemned by the commentators and judges as disappointing and sloppy, while behaviour no more or less insane is hailed as excellent and just the thing, and indeed quite the spectacle to behold. </p> <p>I wonder if any of these people saw the opening ceremony? For their sakes I hope not; if they find watching a horse getting the shakes in a sand-pit spectacular, the sight of those fireworks would have exploded their minds.</p> <p>Now I know there must be rules to dressage. It's not really just craziness arbitrarily scored, like a sort of tortured horse version of Mornington Crescent, but the fact that brilliance and incompetence are indistinguishable to all but the dressage cognoscenti does not speak well of the sport. </p> <p>I couldn't watch it for long without the question \"Why is doing this in any way good?\" springing to mind. I'm perfectly willing to admit that it must be very difficult to make horses do that, but what's the point?</p> <p>Obviously I'm straying into dangerous territory asking what's the point of a sport - you can argue that almost any leisure activity is pointless, but most sports involve at least something accomplished or exciting enough to make it clear why the activity is pursued. But with dressage, I'm not sure. I completely understand why it's good to make horses run fast or jump over things - but what is the satisfaction in this tuneless dance, this effortful yet unentertaining capering about?</p> <p>I must admit that my feelings against dressage are intensified by the fact that it's one of the sports that is scored by judges. I don't like that. I accept that some sort of judging is involved in all Olympic events - whether it's a referee in a hockey match or a line judge in the tennis - but the judging involved in gymnastics, diving and dressage is on a completely different level. They're not just deciding whether or not a goal has been scored, but what a goal actually is. The spectre of artistic impression hangs over them all in a way that makes me suspect that, skilful and worthwhile though gymnastics and diving may be, they should be put in the same category as dancing rather than the shot put: they're not, essentially, proper sports.</p> <p>A proper sport has a clearly defined aim: \"Get to that line first\", \"Throw that object the furthest\", \"Kick that round thing into that gap more times than them\". It doesn't matter how inelegantly these things are done, the winner is clear; indeed, as sports develop, what is effective in the achievement of the stated aim is what comes to look elegant.</p> <p>Sports that involve a judging panel have much fuzzier aims - a combination of electing to do difficult things while not being seen to have made any mistakes - and so you need several people's opinions to determine the extent to which the competitor has succeeded. If such subjectivity is permissible in determining victory or defeat, then why not open up the Olympics to ballroom dancing (after all, ice dancing is in the Winter Olympics), flower arranging or amateur dramatics? You might say that not all of those activities require peak physical fitness, but then neither do archery or shooting.</p> <p>The distinction between proper and judged sports is at its clearest when you compare ski jumping in the Winter Olympics with the long jump. In ski jumping points are determined by various factors including \"style\" whereas the long jump is entirely about how far you jump, no matter how much of a gangly fool you look while you do it.</p> <p>Surely the aim of ski jumping should be to jump as far or high as possible and then land safely? Why should style have anything to do with it if it doesn't help you jump further? If it was discovered that an airborne attempt at the hokey cokey added yards to the jump distance, surely that's what the jumpers should do - but they wouldn't because they'd lose points for style.</p> <p>Of course the scoring problem is less easily fixed when it comes to gymnastics and diving, and I'm not really saying that the Olympics would be better without them. The fact that they are Olympic sports encourages people to get involved. And, within those sports, there's undoubtedly a clear sense of what excellence is.</p> <p>But I'd nix the dressage in a heartbeat - and bring in snooker instead. It should be at least a couple of Olympiads before the Chinese and the Germans are better at that than us.</p>",
  "<p>In the anarchic world we politely term international relations, there was little surprising or unusual about the Russian aggressions into South Ossetia and Abkhazia. A great power was in a fierce quarrel with a small neighbour about that most commonplace cause of war - who should be boss when mixed ethnic groups claim the same lands and straddle international borders. Eventually the larger nation savagely spanked the smaller one, chiefly to impose its own solution on the problem but partly also to remind onlookers of that age-old truth: \"the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must\". Big boys still rule. </p> <p>Yet if there are no surprises, there certainly are many intriguing implications. As diplomatic historians well know, a relatively small incident in foreign affairs can have an importance well beyond the region in which the clash takes place - because of the responses of the larger powers, because it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the available international machinery, and because it reminds us of the political realities and priorities of the age. Yet crises that seemed serious at the time - say, the Anglo-French confrontation over Fashoda in 1898 - have faded into the dustiest textbooks. A somewhat later crisis, such as Munich in 1938, is continually thrown up as a \"lesson\" for our present age.</p> <p>More often than not, a sudden confrontation can catch a great power in a state of some confusion. It would be fascinating, for instance, to know how the Chinese politburo is regarding the events in Ossetia. At present, clearly, its chief concern is the Olympics, and there must surely be irritation with both Georgia and Russia for pushing their quarrel into open shooting now. There must also be concern about revived Russian assertiveness and nationalism - although there is no fear in Beijing, for the Chinese know the canny Putin wouldn't push things against them: China is strong, and doesn't mind taking losses, so don't mess with it. More upsetting, Russia has breached that clause of the UN charter China holds most important of all: no interference in the internal affairs of a member nation.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Han Chinese cannot but like the idea of dissident ethnic minorities along a troublesome border being firmly spanked. Georgia's fate is not a matter of direct concern to Beijing. And Putin's roughing of Mikheil Saakashvili's government is a blow to American prestige and influence in Asia, always a congenial thought to China. So, while never, ever trusting the Russians, China can see that the Ossetian mess is nothing to get upset about.</p> <p>This is certainly not the feeling in Nato and the EU, or in the major capitals of Europe. Here, above all in France and Germany (Gordon Brown seems beset by his own regional difficulties, in Scotland), there is concern that Russian military actions and political toughness portend a fading away of the post-1991 \"new European order\" - that it is a sort of latter-day Rhineland crisis of 1936, heralding the end of Versailles treaty Europe. Friendship with Russia cannot wear the bullying and blackmail of western companies like BP, the attempted intimidation of Russian dissidents in the west, the re-entry of the KGB into foreign countries - in sum, the plain fact that Russia is not \"normal\". It is not Poland, it is not Hungary; it never knew the Enlightenment. </p> <p>And it is scary in other ways. First, Russia is terrifying to all those east European states that sought eagerly to flee the bear's grasp at the first opportunity following 1989 and 1991: to states, therefore, to whom Europe extended not only the economic and cultural ties of the EU but the security ties of Nato, with all its frightening implications. Right now, Georgia is not a Nato member, despite the Bush administration's urgings. This must be a cause for massive, nervous relief in Brussels and Washington. But what if a border dispute arises between Estonia (now in Nato) and Russia? Are the Portuguese and Danish armies prepared to march east? Are the Germans? Secondly, how will western and central Europe handle its heavy dependence on Russian natural gas, and its awful capacity for being blackmailed by Moscow? Things have come a long way since the wall crashed down in November 1989.</p> <p>As for the US, the possible implications of the last week are many and serious. Consider the challenge facing Washington: how on earth to make a coherent policy in response to a distant, fast-exploding ethno-linguistic conflict, contested borders, a risk-prone Georgian ally, an increasingly assertive Russia with a new energy trump card, a confused EU and a paralysed security council? All at a time when other areas of the world have sucked in US military resources, as if its own politicians were not already preoccupied enough by the nonsenses of presidential campaigning. We don't have the big stick. Moscow does, at least in this area of the world. You can only push western influence so far eastwards into Eurasia. Napoleon learned that, Hitler learned that: George Bush's time has come.</p> <p>This brings us to the larger geopolitical meaning of the Georgian scrap - namely, the measure of US power in today's fast-changing world. It could be better. It has been brought lower during the past eight years by inconsiderate and sometimes arrogant diplomacy, by an obsession with \"the war on terror\" and reckless fiscal policies. The post-1991 decade of the US's position as unchallenged number one - in Charles Krauthammer's memorable phrase, \"the unipolar moment\" - is over. To later historians, the pace of this shift will seem astounding. In the early 1990s, the elder George Bush, James Baker and other foreign policy veterans were wondering how to prevent Russia collapsing. Now the concern is about excessive Russian power.</p> <p>To other scholars, the Caucasian struggles may appear as a storm in a teacup. The real challenge to the US in the future - and perhaps to the west more generally - is the steady rise of Asia and, in particular, China. Putin's muscle-flexing against pesky small neighbours is a mischievous distraction. </p> <p>At the end of the day (but when is that?), it is probably Putin's hard-knuckled Russia that will be the loser. He may look tough and confident now, but his deck of cards is not so strong for the future. His strength rests on two supports: energy supplies and Russian nationalism. Those oil and natural-gas resources may evaporate sooner than he thinks. And Russian nationalism provokes enormous fear, enmity and resistance. Around the vast, open frontiers of the present Russian republic, and among the 100 ethnic minorities within the borders, no one loves the Russians. That has to be a geopolitical drag.</p> <p>So the Ossetian scrap is important, though it should not be exaggerated out of proportion. But it tells us a lot about our present, delicate, international system of states. We have interesting times ahead.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Paul Kennedy is Dilworth professor of history and director of international security studies at Yale University.

  "<p>It's a tough call, and likely to present a less than edifying spectacle: Jade Goody being invited to just be herself on the Indian version of Big Brother, her conduct interpreted by Shilpa Shetty, the erstwhile witness of her crowning stupidity; or the sight of two nations pretending to wring their hands at this prospect - all the while secretly rubbing them with sadistic delight. Despite the news that Jade is to be paid \u00a3100,000 for her new role as cultural scapegoat for British ignorance and latent racism, I can't help but feel a little sorry for her. As Simon Darcourt, the villain of my new book observes, he has murdered several hundred people, but would still win a popularity contest against Jade after Shettygate. Jade has been made up to play the pantomime villain, but who is really being cruel here?</p> <p>I have long understood that whatever you loathe most about trends in TV will be the aspects that endure and worsen. What you consider a cultural low watermark will, 20 years hence, seem like a lost intellectual golden age. I have learned, therefore, not merely to accept reality TV, but to accept the worst of it, which means specifically embracing its cruelty, prejudice and sadism. Instead of wringing our hands about it, my solution is to suggest we should be looking to push the envelope.</p> <p>When I say the worst of it, let me emphasise that I'm not talking about Big Brother here. We all cringe at its contestants' toddler-like voracity for affirmation, but there is a reason why, for some, dignity has become a less desirable commodity than fame, and that reason was publicly consecrated when ITV's Fat Camp became Celebrity Fit Club. Celebrities are the hallowed caste in a culture where you might only be famous for 15 minutes, but can remain a \"celebrity\" for years after everyone has forgotten what it was you were ever actually famous for. However, we can't make the special people seem more special without making the lesser specimens seem more dull, and a sneering contempt for the ordinary punter is what lies at the core of the true reality nasties: what I would term the \"lifestyle supremacy\" programmes. </p> <p>I don't need to name any - you know the format: a spoiled and bloodless ice maiden (or two) tries to compensate for being bullied at Roedean by stripping, often literally, all pride and self-respect from some poor wretch who has been left downtrodden by the deprivations of having to live a normal life. \"Poor Deirdre obviously doesn't have a very good fund manager, because despite working for a living - in one of those ghastly 'real' jobs where you can't write down lunch at The Ivy as an expense - she hasn't been able to afford a doula or an au pair, far less a nanny, and has therefore had to [gasp] raise her own children! This has left very little time or money to spend on beauty therapies and has sadly resulted in her looking like a radiation victim who gets dressed in the dark.\" </p> <p>Dowdy Deirdre is then granted a day-pass into the world of the celeb-caste, briefly transforming her via ministrations and personnel she could normally neither access nor afford, before the carriage turns back into a pumpkin and Deirdre has to go back to being an ordinary mutant. And people say my work is sick.</p> <p>But rather than moan about it, I say: let's spread the cruelty, and let's take it where it hasn't been before. Instead of a show that intrudes upon, patronises and humiliates \"ordinary\" people, I suggest one that intrudes upon, patronises and humiliates TV presenters and the executives behind these abominations; a show that takes apart their lives, foibles and failings and then helps them reconstruct themselves in a manner more acceptable to the prejudices of the programme's target demographic. </p> <p>\"This week, we'll be meeting Tabitha. She's a successful television presenter with her own production company, but she doesn't know which lap-dancing club her coke-addled boyfriend is currently favouring, and is still trying to prove her worth to a father who always seemed to love her older sister more. She recently spent more than she pays her char per annum to have her home 'spiritually cleansed', owns a wardrobe worth more than the average house and hasn't worn the wrong thing since her second-form end-of-term disco. Nonetheless, she wouldn't be able to tell you the name of the prime minister without Googling, and can't find her own \u00a340,000 wet-room without her PA relaying directions via her BlackBerry. Tonight, we're going to help her calculate the true worth of her existence using our famous vacu-ometer. Then, after we've talked her down from the ledge, we'll have our regular consultant Deirdre on hand to give Tabitha some tips on building relationships with people whose affection won't be conditional upon her haircut.\" </p> <p>The show is going to be called: So You Want to be a Bit Less of a Twunt.

  "<p>The Chelsea hotel, in New York. A hot day in summer. On the pavement outside, a grizzled blonde swills gin from a paper bag. In the lobby, a self-consciously hip young couple are having a domestic. At the front desk, a man with silvery hair stands with a pigeon on his shoulder. They are all regular guests.</p> <p>The Chelsea, a landmark on Manhattan's West 23rd Street, has for decades been a mecca for bohemians - poets, painters and punks who lived and died in its rooms. Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin all once called it home. Edie Sedgwick set fire to it. Sid Vicious was charged with stabbing his girlfriend to death in room 100. In short, it's not what most people would call a great environment for families. </p> <p>But try telling that to Joseph O'Neill, Sally Singer and their three children. O'Neill, an Irish writer whose new novel Netherland is hotly tipped to win this year's Man Booker prize, and Singer, a fashion journalist at Vogue, have set up an elegant, kitschy home in the hotel that describes itself as \"a rest stop for rare individuals\".</p> <p>Saturday morning breakfast at the O'Neills' is a chaotic affair. When I visit, we sit over takeaway coffee and croissants in the tiny retro-chic kitchen as a flurry of small, screaming boys dash around us. The cat, Lola, a tawny, green-eyed queen with a powder-puff tail, swishes in and out of the room. O'Neill, dressed in cricket gear for his weekly game, is gracious and chatty. </p> <p>\"They like the Chelsea,\" he says, referring to the children, because despite the sensationalised stories, \"There's a strong sense of community and it's one of the last fragments of a counter-cultural, unselfconscious place.\"</p> <p>Singer enjoys the perverse glamour of living in a hotel. \"I like that there are transients coming in every night,\" she says. \"I love the continual stream of people to look at. I don't want to live in my own closed-off space. People just drop by and knock on your door. I want to open my door and let the world in - and let my kids out.\"</p> <p>Their cosy, light-filled, three- bedroom suite, sparsely decorated with a mix of modern and antique pieces, seamlessly blends glamour and domesticity. In the living room, the white walls are filled with family photographs, while moody silkscreen images of Sid Vicious take pride of place above a curvy white sofa. </p> <p>The children have their own brightly wallpapered two-room suite - one room for sleeping and the other for playing. Tucked away beyond the playroom, stretching along the entire length of the wall, cubby-hole shelves sparkle with a vast clutter of women's shoes. (O'Neill reveals that \"Sally confessed only after we were together for a while that she was a fashion addict.\") </p> <p>The couple arrived in Manhattan in 1998, having emigrated from London with their two cats. \"Sally was offered a job at Elle,\" says O'Neill, \"so we crossed the ocean out of curiosity.\" He had no credit history and Singer, who is American, had virtually lost hers as a consequence of living abroad. So they ended up at the Chelsea with its bordello-like atmosphere, rock'n'roll ghosts and luminaries past and present. Since they have lived there, Deborah Harry, Ethan Hawke and the singer-songwriters Ryan Adams and Rufus Wainwright have taken up residence at various times.</p> <p>Previously little known, O'Neill, 44, is this year's sensation for his novel Netherland. Hailed as the \"King of New York\" by New York Magazine, he's been compared to an array of literary greats from F Scott Fitzgerald to VS Naipaul. The New York Times Book Review praised Netherland as \"the wittiest, angriest, most exacting and desolate work of fiction written about life in post 9/11 New York\". Much of his racy thriller is set in the Chelsea itself. The narrator, Dutch exile Hans van der Broek, adrift after his wife leaves him, observes that at the Chelsea, \"the furtiveness and ornamental diversity reminds him of the population of an aquarium he kept as a child\". </p> <p>For the O'Neill boys, too, the hotel is vivid and otherworldly, like the inside of a genie bottle, teeming with magical possibilities and exotic creatures. They race their bikes and skateboards along the white marble corridors past drag queens, mad old ladies, ageing rockers and men with angel wings and tiaras. For them, as their father says, every day is Halloween. Their mother thinks it's a good, stimulating environment for children.</p> <p>\"Come talk about why you live here,\" Singer asks her eight-year-old son, Malachy, as he shows his new comic book, one of a series that he wrote, coloured and stapled, scattered around the flat. </p> <p>\"Because I was born here,\" he snaps.</p> <p>\"What do you like about the hotel?\" she persists. </p> <p>\"I like the guy who lived in the bathroom.\"</p> <p>This gentleman, she explains, was \"squatting in the communal bathroom. They had to kick him out one morning and he went crazy.\" </p> <p>Does Malachy think any of the people are strange? \"Mrs Bolow. The woman who lies in bed all day,\" he says after a while. \"And the ghost who threw your platform shoe at me while I was sleeping.\" As for his younger brothers, they like living at the hotel \"because you get to climb stuff\". </p> <p>What do their family and friends think about bringing up children in a hotel? \"Most of our friends don't think it is strange,\" says O'Neill. \"I'm not sure how my parents feel. I imagine the Chelsea is not what they had in mind, but that it's no big deal. It's not as if we're living in a yurt.\" </p> <p>\"I know there are many people who wouldn't dream of bringing up their children in a hotel, where a large proportion of the people are checking in for the night,\" adds Singer. \"I know some people like to control the environment that children live in. They find comfort in predictability because the city is unexpected enough. But if you want to live in a sheltered world, where there's a doorman and no rogue element, you don't check into a hotel. What makes you persist, even when it doesn't make economic sense, is that people who live here deeply connect with it and don't think about things in a traditional way.\" </p> <p>Singer considers the hotel to be an eclectic, multi-generational village. \"There are grandparents whose grandchildren come and visit them and the teenagers next door, who we've known since they were kids, are our babysitters. There are other families in the building so the boys have friends here. They go to the local primary school and take part in the usual round of sleepovers, parties and adventures in the hallways. We also have eccentrics of every description and everyone tolerates it. There's that old-fashioned communal attitude here.\" </p> <p>O'Neill claims he's not one for nostalgia but \"the whole place is magic. But it's not a theme park. It's authentic, an organic village in the middle of the city, where the people are friendly and fascinating.\" It's also a place where you quickly learn to integrate the extraordinary into the everyday - the stream of fashion and film shoots and cocktail parties in the lobby. One of O'Neill's fondest memories is when he and Malachy, then a baby, were invited over for dinner by the late playwright Arnold Weinstein, who lived across the hall, and they ended up spending the evening with Arthur Miller, his photographer wife Inge Morath and friends. Their daughter, Rebecca Miller, the writer and filmmaker, was raised here for part of her childhood, in room 614, where Henri Cartier-Bresson sometimes read her bedtime stories and the Grateful Dead lived next door, smoking pot and having three-day-long parties with bus-loads of groupies.</p> <p>When Singer, 43, was growing up in Oakland, California, in the 1970s, \"with the surrealism of hippie culture, the violence of the Manson Family killings and the SLA [Symbionese Liberation Army] and Patty Hearst kidnapping happening in our backyard,\" she lost herself in fashion magazines. Seduced by the myths of Studio 54 and the Factory, she \"wanted to work for Warhol's Interview magazine and wrote him letters. I love that whole world - the beat Generation, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso. I was absorbed by the fabulousness of it,\" she says. \"So it was inevitable that this is where I should live.\" </p> <p>\"Actually, it was my idea to come to the Chelsea,\" O'Neill says, throwing his wife a knowing glance. \"Sally made it happen. I had the outsider's sense of possibility.\" </p> <p>O'Neill met Singer in 1991 when she was his editor at the publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux on his first book, This Is the Life, shortly after graduating in law from Cambridge. They lived in Stockwell, south London, and upgraded to Soho while he worked as a barrister, mainly defending death-row prisoners in the Commonwealth. She worked for the London Review of Books and later British Vogue. Moving to New York, they expected to stay briefly and rented a seventh-floor, one-bedroom apartment in the Chelsea, shifting to a bigger place upstairs when Malachy was born in 1999.</p> <p>After two more sons followed - Pascal, now seven, and Oscar, five - they left the hotel. \"You know, some people leave because of the mice, some because of the cockroaches and others because of the people in the elevator,\" says O'Neill. \"For us, it was sheer practicality. We thought our life had to assume a more adult size.\" So they bought \"an adult-size, eight-bedroom Victorian\" in Flatbush, one of the not-so-fashionable parts of Brooklyn, and spent months renovating it. </p> <p>O'Neill \"liked the light, the summer roses, the horse chestnuts\" and melting-pot neighbourhood. The boys and the cat enjoyed \"having a garden, lots of stairs and rooms to run and hide in. They loved the ice-cream truck that went down the street.\" But Singer was miserable and felt isolated from her Manhattan friends.</p> <p>\"I thought I was living the life that my parents hoped for,\" she says. \"but when I showed them the house they were disappointed. They're so used to coming to see me in seedy neighbourhoods with two rooms and a bed that pulls out of the wall. I know many English people think children need gardens, country houses to escape to. I don't want that. I think there's too much stuff in the world. You're not light on your feet and can't go at any moment.\"</p> <p>Within months, Singer was desperate to return. O'Neill reluctantly agreed. \"Well, you know,\" he sighs good-naturedly, \"if your wife says to you, 'I don't want to live here any more,' what are the options?\" After 18 months, they sold the house and returned to their old flat, knocking together an adjacent studio to create a three-bedroom apartment, for which they pay $5,000 (\u00a32,600) a month in rent. </p> <p>\"It surprised me how attached I am to the Chelsea,\" says Singer. I cried for days when we left. It's a village that I feel at home in. The residents feel they live in a sprawling extended house. We often have dinner with our neighbours. Last Thanksgiving, she \"made a feast for 30. We cooked here and moved upstairs to my friend Susan's for dinner. Then we went up to Gerald's top-floor apartment, which has a roof garden, for drinks.\" </p> <p>Some thrive on the buzz of communal living. Others come here to disappear. O'Neill and Singer are drawn by the diversity of the Chelsea hotel, which is like New York itself - dark, crumbling and colourful - a microcosm of Manhattan, where everyone has a story. </p> <p>\"These days, to rent and not buy is a radical act. We chose to rent this place instead of buying an apartment elsewhere and we don't have anything to show for it. A lot of people find that unacceptable,\" says O'Neill.</p> <p>But don't they love their life here? \"Yeah, exactly,\" he beams. \"How do you place a value on happiness? You'll never have a conversation about real estate in this hotel. And that's because the owner, Stanley Bard, has created this extraordinary community that reflects his whimsies and his peculiar, rather crazed priorities.\"</p> <p>They speak of Bard with warmth and frustration. He was ousted by his two partners last year after running the hotel for 50 years, helping many brilliant artists along the way. The change in management, stream of evictions and public disputes have left many residents worried that the Chelsea will be turned into just another boutique hotel. \"It's a fake war,\" O'Neill says philosophically. \"We just have to ride it out.\"</p> <p>In a world where imitation is celebrated, the Chelsea is a bulwark against conformity. As Arthur Miller wrote, \"This hotel does not belong to America. There are no vacuum cleaners, no rules and no shame.\"</p> <p>\"It's a grounding place and it defines my existence in New York,\" says Singer. She describes how Hiroya, a Japanese artist who paid his way through life with his paintings, left several works of art to the hotel before dying of a heroin overdose a few years ago. One of his paintings, which hangs between the seventh and eighth floors, has writing scrawled across it that translates as: \"From here, it's heaven.\" \"That's how we feel,\" she adds. \"I can't imagine living anywhere else.\"</p>",
  "<p>Haji Juma Khan leads something of a charmed existence. A towering tribesman from Afghanistan's border badlands, Khan uses the title \"Haji\" because he has completed the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest shrine. But piety is not his sole concern: he is also one of about 20 men who run Afghanistan's \u00a32bn heroin trade. Business is good. Last year the country's fields of pretty pink poppies produced a record harvest, sending drug production soaring to new heights, funding the Taliban and thrusting Afghanistan into ever greater chaos. And despite the best efforts of western counter-narcotics specialists - who have spent six years and more than \u00a31.7bn in fighting the heroin trade - Khan is free as a bird. </p> <p>His empire is centred on Baramcha, a scruffy town in the Chagai Hills on the Pakistani border. Khan, an ethnic Baluch, seized control of this parched area in the dying days of Taliban rule in late 2001 and turned it into a bustling hub of smuggling and gun running. It is dotted with heroin labs: rough shacks where turbaned men, tutored by imported chemists from Iran and elsewhere, use chemicals and vats of boiling water to refine bars of sticky brown opium into bags of powdery white or brown heroin. The drug departs on convoys of high-speed jeeps, bristling with weaponry, that dash across the desert towards the Iranian border. It is then sold to criminal gangs who push the heroin to its end customers: addicts in Europe and Russia. </p> <p>The town is also a springboard for Taliban attacks. Insurgents pass through training camps and madrasas in the town on their way north into Helmand, where 8,000 British troops are based. Opium flows in the opposite direction. The vast, unruly province provides Khan with a bountiful supply of raw drugs. Last year Helmand produced 53% of the Afghan poppy crop, making it the world's single greatest source of illicit drugs, producing more than Colombia, Mexico and Burma combined. Impressive for a province with just 2.5 million people. </p> <p>Khan makes the law in Baramcha and brooks no dissent. The last time the provincial government dispatched a team of border police to the town, three years ago, 11 officers were captured and reportedly beheaded. More recently, Khan's operations have been raided by Commando Force 333, an Afghan paramilitary unit trained by the (British) Special Boat Service. Afghan soldiers swoop in armoured helicopters, forcing their way into the drug labs and arresting whomever they find. Their British mentors usually come, too. The latest raid on Baramcha, in June, netted five tonnes of opium; 13 smugglers, including four Iranians, were arrested. </p> <p>Commando Force 333, operating under great secrecy from a fort south of Kabul, is considered a success in the war on drugs. But it has never come close to Khan. He is more likely to be found in the port cities of the United Arab Emirates - Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah - where, money-laundering experts say, much of Afghanistan's dirty cash ultimately ends up. Khan has snapped up property and a small fleet of cargo ships, based in Sharjah, which according to reports he has used for smuggling heroin out of Pakistan. His wealth is conservatively estimated in the tens of millions of pounds - money that may also be funding bloodshed: counter-narcotics officials have evidence of a meeting between Khan and insurgents including senior Taliban figures and lieutenants of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an al-Qaida sympathiser fighting US forces in Afghanistan's mountainous east. </p> <p>The Taliban appears to have lost its aversion to drugs since 2001, when the black-turbaned fighters banned the poppy crop at gunpoint. Now they tax farmers who grow poppies at a rate of 10% and, in some places, protect drug-smuggling convoys, also for a slice of the profits. This lucrative sideline earns the fighters at least \u00a350m a year, according to the UN; others put the figure higher. Men such as Khan are key to their success. </p> <p>The world's leading counter-narcotics agencies - America's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - are trying to keep tabs on him from their Kabul embassies. Yet they cannot lay a glove on him. Instead Khan flits with ease between the UAE, Baramcha, Quetta in western Pakistan, and Kabul. \"He's everywhere, just doing his thing,\" one official admits. </p> <p>Ironically, the authorities once had him in their grasp. In late 2001 US soldiers picked up an elderly, pious-looking Baluch tribesman near the southern city of Kandahar. They identified him as Khan, Time magazine later reported, but their objective was Osama bin Laden and the Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Border rogues were low on their list of priorities. And so the soldiers let him go. </p> <p>It was a costly error. In the years since, it has become clear that the fight to save Afghanistan - from the Taliban and from debilitating corruption - is unlikely to be won without getting the better of men such as Khan. </p> <p>The project of rebuilding Afghanistan, so heartily promised by President Bush after his troops invaded in 2001, is in grave peril. The country is in terrible shape. A resurgent Taliban has swept the southern and eastern provinces, destabilising the countryside and knocking at the gates of Kabul. Britain has so far lost 114 soldiers; the past two months were the deadliest ever for American troops there. The other, less visible, threat is equally ominous. Drug-related corruption has infected every level of government, crippling governance programmes and dangerously undermining Afghan leaders in the eyes of their own people. Policemen, parliamentarians, governors and probably several ministers are on the drug networks' payroll. President Hamid Karzai has been forced repeatedly to deny allegations that members of his own family are involved. Among western allies, patience is fraying. Thomas Schweich, a former senior US official, launched a scathing attack on Karzai last month, accusing him of sheltering the drug lords. \"He was playing us like a fiddle,\" he wrote in the New York Times. </p> <p>The war on drugs is about much more than money. In other countries drugs are a criminal activity driven by greed. In Afghanistan, battered by three decades of conflict, they are a tool of political power. \"Afghanistan isn't like anything anyone has worked on before from a drug perspective,\" says Doug Wankel, a veteran counter-narcotics officer. \"This is not Burma or Thailand or Mexico or Colombia. This is a fledgling nation that is just starting to stand up again after 30 years of disarray and destruction. It's so fragile, and corruption is such an issue, that this whole drug thing can play into the other ills of the country, destroying this government and pushing the nation into big-time civil disorder. Why? Because you have so many people who can get so many weapons. It's entirely different, I'm telling you.\"</p> <p>Wankel, a 62-year-old American, has long experience of Afghanistan's drug wars. His career began in 1970 when, as a Missouri law student, he saw a TV ad for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, predecessor of the DEA. \"I'm sitting there thinking James Bond and women and adventure. So I called the toll-free number,\" he recalls. They sent him to Detroit, then the murder capital of America, where his job was to buy drugs: cocaine and PCP (phencyclidine) in well-to-do white neighbourhoods and heroin in the run-down black areas. Wankel, skinny as a rake, passed for a junkie. The experience blew his mind. \"You remember Shaft?\" he says. \"You actually had these guys on the streets, wearing their big-brimmed hats and fancy long coats, and driving those pimpmobiles with the white walls. It was amazing, just like you see on TV.\"</p> <p>Eight years later, seeking a fresh adventure, the young DEA officer had himself transferred to Kabul. It was a pivotal moment. Three months on, the dictator Muhammad Daud was overthrown in a communist coup. At the end of the following year, in December 1979, 100,000 Soviet troops rolled in. The Red Army occupation triggered a bloody 10-year war between the Soviets and CIA-funded fighters known as the mujahideen. The jihad, as they called it, also marked the start of the heroin era. For 150 years Afghan farmers had grown small amounts of poppy, mostly in Badakhshan province in the north. After jihad erupted, the business got serious. Shinwari tribesmen in eastern Nangarhar and their tribal cousins, the Afridis in Pakistan's Khyber Agency, started to process opium into heroin (10kg of opium makes about 1kg of heroin). Profits multiplied, and by the mid 1980s Afghanistan was supplying one third of the world's heroin. </p> <p>By then Wankel had left - the Soviets had accused him of spying - and moved on to operations in Pakistan, Colombia and Peru, rising to the number three position in the DEA. In 2004 he was called back to Afghanistan to coordinate counter-narcotics policy, and now works as a private consultant. He is frustrated at how the west has mishandled the drugs war. \"From the beginning the military thought they could do security and leave narcotics and corruption for later. They were wrong,\" he says. \"There's got to be a comprehensive strategy that also involves rule of law, corruption and drugs. Otherwise you can forget it.\"</p> <p>The more the west has poured money into fighting drugs in Afghanistan, the more heroin has poured out of the country. Since 2002 the UK, which coordinates the international effort, has spent \u00a3262m on training soldiers, police, investigators and judges, and building a new drugs court. The US has given \u00a31bn. In addition the two countries have blown a total of \u00a3420m on \"alternative livelihoods\" - rural development projects to persuade poppy farmers to switch crops. Over the same period the poppy crop has exploded, hitting a record high of 193,000 hectares last year - enough to carpet Greater London and the Isle of Wight. (This year's crop figures are due later this month.) Nor is all of this produce exported: driven by much misery and an abundance of cheap heroin, Afghanistan's own addict population is rising fast. The last survey, three years ago, recorded 920,000 users; the number is almost certainly higher now, a flood of drug-using refugees having since returned from Pakistan and Iran. </p> <p>These failures have caused bewilderment and a bad-tempered debate about how to combat drug production in Afghanistan. None of those involved - Karzai, western diplomats, Nato generals, many self-styled counter-narcotics experts - seems able to agree on the answer. The Senlis Council, a pugnacious NGO, favours legalising the poppy crop. Others, chiefly in America, press for wholesale destruction. Last year the US spent \u00a388m on an eradication programme run by DynCorp, a company that employs many retired American special forces soldiers. Over the harvesting season, DynCorp led hundreds of Afghan workers through the fields of Helmand and Uruzgan, thrashing down poppies with tractors and sticks. Fired at by angry farmers and opportunistic insurgents, and obstructed by bent local officials, the eradicators managed to destroy just 3,000 hectares. This seemed a bad deal. It would have been 10 times cheaper - and less bloody, since three eradicators were shot - to have simply bought the farmers' opium. But that solution doesn't work, either, as the British discovered five years ago when a buy-back scheme collapsed after officials realised it simply encouraged farmers to grow more poppies the next year. They turned up at the Kabul embassy demanding payment from embarrassed British officials. In diplomatic circles, the episode has been politely forgotten.</p> <p>The other big idea is aerial spraying. The US favours dispatching armoured crop-duster planes loaded with the weedkiller Roundup to spray the poppy fields; British and Afghan officials are opposed to the idea, saying it would enrage already hostile farmers. The US ambassador William Wood, who was formerly posted to Colombia, has tried to convince Afghan officials worried about the safety implications of the herbicide, saying he would even take a shower in it. A British official retorted: \"It's Roundup. My dad puts it on his weeds. It doesn't mean he uses it for his tea or to bathe in.\" </p> <p>But the focus on farmers, who are often poor and indebted, seems unfair. According to the UN, the average southern poppy farmer made \u00a31,658 from last year's harvest. That's about one third more than he would have earned growing wheat, enough to clothe his children and send them to the local school - assuming the Taliban hadn't torched it. By contrast, the 20 top traffickers pulled in profits of \u00a31.5bn. It's time to switch focus, says Christina Oguz, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Kabul. \"We are looking too much at cultivation and not enough at the top of the drug networks,\" she says.</p> <p>A 96-cell high security jail for high-level drug traffickers has been built, with \u00a31.1m of British money; it was handed over to the Afghan justice ministry last June. As no drug lords have been captured, however, it is likely to be filled with Taliban commanders. The heads of the drug networks, meanwhile, live freely, openly flaunting their great wealth. A raid by DEA agents on the home of a major trafficker in Nangarhar last November gives a sense of the sums involved: meticulously kept account books detailed heroin shipments worth \u00a381m over a nine-month period. In a broken, poverty-stricken country such as Afghanistan, these gangsters' main difficulty is spending the money. Status demands a few essentials. A fleet of Lexus Land Cruisers - hulking 4x4s with tinted windows, video entertainment systems and usually no licence plate - is de rigueur, as are gangly mansions in Sherpur, a new Kabul neighbourhood known for \"narcotecture\" - a gaudy style with sweeping balustrades, wedding-cake plasterwork and blue mirrored windows. The label may be unfair - some Sherpur residents surely earn their money honestly - but in a country in which drugs account for one third of gross domestic product, and the competing exports are carpets, fruit and nuts, many Afghans have a different idea. \"The owners are the ones who killed our people and drank our blood,\" construction worker Hussain told me three years ago outside a mansion he was building. \"But at least it is providing us with work.\"</p> <p>Most of the drug loot goes abroad. \"There are a lot of wealthy people in Afghanistan but the money is not here,\" says Nick Lockwood, a former drugs adviser at the British embassy. \"It's in Dubai.\" Traffickers wire their profits to the UAE using hawala, the age-old informal money transfer system that is cheap, fast and, best of all, leaves no paper trail. When it lands there are few questions asked: along with the Russian mob and Colombian cartels, Afghan drug lords are among Dubai's big investors.</p> <p>One \"big fish\", as Afghans call them, has been netted - in rare circumstances. In 2005, American agents lured Haji Bashir Noorzai, leader of a major smuggling clan in Kandahar, to New York. Noorzai thought he was there to curry favour with the Americans by providing intelligence on the Taliban. He was put up in a smart Manhattan hotel not far from the site of the destroyed Twin Towers, and interrogated, in a friendly way, for more than a week. But on the 13th day, the agents clapped him in handcuffs and brought him before a judge. The DEA later described him as the \"Pablo Escobar of Afghanistan\"; Noorzai's lawyer says he was a victim of entrapment. His trial is due to start shortly. </p> <p>That ruse is unlikely to work a second time. So the latest western scheme is to improve - in fact, build from scratch - Afghanistan's own justice system. It is a gargantuan task. The necessary institutions are rotten: the police are poorly trained and corrupt; so are the judges. Most honest, educated officials have fled the country. In the rare instances when Afghan courts have sent major drug traffickers to jail, they have almost invariably been released within weeks - on the orders of senior government officials. Oguz of the UNODC calls this \"telephone justice\".</p> <p>Undaunted, Britain and America are training the police. A dedicated counter-narcotics force has been set up; Soca and DEA agents are currently teaching a new \"special investigations unit\" the arts of phone-tapping, running informers and gathering evidence. Recruits to this force must pass lie detector and urine analysis tests, and not all make it: drug addiction levels among police are said to be extremely high.</p> <p>In an effort to evade Afghanistan's flawed courts, these donors have set up a special drugs court on the edge of Kabul. Western lawyers train its prosecutors. Judges are paid 10 times more than the going rate in the hope of keeping them honest. This appears to be working: last year the court scored 278 convictions, up from 182 in 2006. Sentences are stiff, with a minimum jail term of 10 years. Yet this system is not perfect: prosecutors are markedly better funded and prepared than defence briefs. \"It's very questionable,\" Oguz says. \"Getting evidence is not just about putting the big guys in, it's about making sure innocent people are not in prison.\" And none of those big guys has appeared before this court. </p> <p>The big problem, in almost every counter-narcotics scheme, is corruption. Allegations of covert drug trafficking swirl around many of the leading Afghan officials in the key ministries. Some may be explained as malicious gossip; others are based on hard evidence. One afternoon I visited General Kamal Sadat, who until last year headed the counter-narcotics police. Now, after failing a Soca lie detector test, he is unemployed. British officials asked if he had ever taken a bribe and, he told me angrily, \"I told them the truth.\" But instead of blaming the British, Sadat attributed his downfall to the machinations of his rival - and former colleague - General Muhammad Daud, the deputy interior minister for counter-narcotics. \"It was just a way for him to get me out,\" he spat. </p> <p>Daud is certainly a controversial figure. A former militia leader under the warlord Ahmed Shah Masood, he is a personable man with a taste for dapper suits. Investigations by the Los Angeles Times and other papers have linked the minister and his family to narcotics. Last year one of his senior aides was sentenced to 12 years for trying to sell drugs confiscated by the police. Daud, who harbours ambitions for higher political office, brushes the charges off with a laugh. But two years ago the British took them so seriously, they tried to have him fired; he survived thanks to support from Karzai and the US embassy. Now the British have learned to live with him: in June, Daud visited London on a police training course. </p> <p>Counter-narcotics officials acknowledge that they must work with people who are modestly - or \"acceptably\" - corrupt. After 30 years of war, few Afghan politicians have a clean slate, Wankel says. \"None of us would be able to survive under the circumstances these people have been through in the past 30 years. They obviously did what they had to do. Americans want to think black and white. But you gotta throw that out the window when you come to Afghanistan. Everything here is a shade of grey.\" </p> <p>There's less moral wiggle room for President Karzai. With an election looming next year, he stands accused of going slow on the drugs war to avoid annoying powerful supporters. How things change: in 2004 I attended a conference in the heavily-guarded presidential palace where Karzai declared a \"jihad\" on drugs. Foreign counter-narcotics officials now deride this as a bad joke. The president has not even made symbolic sacrifices: many point to the fact that his anti-corruption tsar, Izzatullah Wasifi, is a convicted drug dealer who served nearly four years in a US jail after being caught selling heroin in a Las Vegas hotel. \"I was a youngster,\" Wasifi told me with a shrug. More troubling allegations centre on Karzai's younger half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, head of the Kandahar provincial council and reputed to be involved in the drugs trade. \"This is really a lot of rubbish,\" Karzai told Der Spiegel in June. \"I have thoroughly investigated all these accusations, and of course none of them are true.\" But the rumours persist.</p> <p>Karzai's relations with the British are strained. In early 2006, under pressure from Britain, Karzai dismissed Sher Muhammad Akhunzada, the long-standing governor of Helmand province and an alleged drug smuggler. The evidence was persuasive: in a raid on the governor's office a few months earlier, DEA officials had found nine tonnes of opium in the basement. (Akhunzada claimed he'd seized the consignment from a smuggler and was about to turn it over to the police.) The head of the DEA, Karen Tandy, later testified to America's Congress that this was the largest stash her agents had seized in Afghanistan. But Karzai, who has family ties with Akhunzada stretching back to the mujahideen war, did not punish him. Instead he rewarded the ex-governor with a seat in the upper house of Afghanistan's parliament. </p> <p>In April I went to see Senator Akhunzada at his Kabul house. For an alleged druglord, it was disappointingly sparse. Sure, a black Land Cruiser was parked in the driveway, but the carpets were mangy and soiled, the ceiling was blotched with damp and the television was an old-fashioned cathode ray tube model - not even a plasma screen. Gently stroking his beard and puffing on a Marlboro Light, Akhunzada lamented the worsening insurgency in his home province. \"Every day more killing and injuries,\" he said, shaking his head. \"Another attack on a police station today. Seven dead.\" In his view, he alone could end the violence. \"If only the British would listen, I could help,\" he sighed, \"but we do not have good relations. If I was governor, the Taliban would not have captured even five inches of land. Now they have five districts.\" He may be right that he could bring change - British officials believe his powerful militia is still running drugs. </p> <p>In a farewell act of chutzpah, Akhunzada handed me a sheaf of paper with his own prescriptions for the drug crisis. It was titled \"Preventation [sic] of poppy cultivation\". The fourth point read: \"The government should make one exact list of smugglers.\" </p> <p>For one such smuggler, Haji Juma Khan, these are interesting times. The Baluch from Baramcha is trying to go legit. According to several officials, Khan has made the government an offer: in return for an amnesty, he will quit the drugs business and invest his money in Afghanistan. \"Think of The Godfather Part III,\" says one source, referring to the movie in which Al Pacino's Michael Corleone tries to go straight. In the film it all goes wrong for Corleone. He ends up a lonely and broken man, slouched on the balcony of a Sicilian villa. The final act of Khan's career, however, has yet to be written.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Wednesday June 4: The Clifton pub, St John's Wood, London</strong></p> <p>I find Rhys Ifans and Dafydd \"Daf\" Ieuan hiding behind their sunglasses in a London pub's beer garden, working their way through some bottles of cider. Would Ifans like some crisps or anything? \"Oh no,\" he replies quickly. \"No, no. No solids.\" The Welsh pair - not shy about their enjoyment of drink or drugs - are here to talk about the band they've formed with eight sometime musicians, mostly from Cardiff. They are called The Peth, which means \"thing\" in Welsh. It is also in-band slang for cocaine. </p> <p>Ieuan's normal source of employment is as the drummer in Super Furry Animals. Ifans is an actor, the scruffily charismatic star of Notting Hill and Enduring Love. They're a bit fuzzy on exactly how long they've known each other, but they think it's around 25 years, their friendship dating back to a Cardiff flat-share in the very early days of the Super Furry Animals, and a good few years before Ifans made his big-screen debut in 1997's Twin Town, a film routinely described as \"the Welsh Trainspotting\". </p> <p>\"I was kind of homeless at the time,\" says Ifans, \"so Daf offered that I sleep in his studio.\" Briefly, Ifans sang with an embryonic incarnation of the Super Furries, and they attempted to record some demos. \"But we passed out, didn't we?\" recalls Ieuan. \"And we had to stop recording.\"</p> <p>Ieuan went on to make eight studio albums with the Welsh indie-psychedelic band; Ifans has just finished shooting the latest film from Richard Curtis, The Boat That Rocked, about British pirate radio. After The Peth's autumn tour he's playing the title role in an adaptation of Welsh drug-smuggler Howard Marks's bestselling autobiography Mr Nice. \"There's gonna be a lot of dope smoking,\" the actor says with a grin. \"That's gonna stretch me!\"</p> <p>But, through the years, their friendship remained firm. When Ieuan began writing songs for an album, a collection called The Golden Mile that hymns the praises of a stretch of Cardiff road where you can buy all your store-cupboard staples (\"Food, beer, plectrums, strings, drugs, whatever\"), he decided to ask Ifans if he'd like to sing them. Who better to front a set of beery but tuneful songs that evoke the best bits of Oasis, Happy Mondays and the Super Furries than the man commonly referred to as \"Britain's most rock'n'roll actor\"? The album's lead single says it all. It's called Let's Go Fucking Mental.</p> <p>Which brings us to the other reason Ifans is hiding out at the back of a quiet pub this afternoon. The off-duty behaviour - boozing, partying, gobbing at the paparazzi - of this fully paid-up member of the Primrose Hill set often propels him into the pages of the tabloids. But Ifans' value to the red-tops has rocketed since he began going out with Sienna Miller in mid-2007. And since they split up, it's zoomed higher still. With unfortunate timing, the news that Miller, 26, reportedly dumped Ifans, 40, by telephone has appeared in The Sun this very morning. She, it is said, caught him going through her texts; he, apparently, was suspicious of her friendship with Matthew Rhys, her co-star in The Edge Of Love; she, allegedly, couldn't cope with his jealousy.</p> <p>Mucky and deeply personal stuff for sure, and it goes some way to explaining Ifans' wobbly demeanour and slurred diction, if not the fact that he's turned up to the interview without any shoes. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday July 2: Portmeirion Town Hall, Portmeirion, Wales </strong></p> <p>We are in Sir Clough Williams-Ellis's model village. The Peth are playing their first-ever gig in the town hall, the opening leg of a five-date tour of the Welsh hinterlands. In the foyer the merchandise stall is selling T-shirts that say \"Pwy Ffwc Di'r Peth?\" (\"Who The Fuck Are The Peth?\").</p> <p>Underneath a vaulted 17th-century ceiling depicting the labours of Hercules, the band pile through their 50-minute set. Ifan clutches a can of Fosters and hangs on to the microphone stand for dear life. Behind the singers, Ieuan plays a Fender Telecaster; it's the first time he's played guitar in public. He, like Ifans, is wearing shades. A couple of the musicians he's recruited appear to be playing little more than their knees. For Last Man Standing, The Peth are joined by an eleventh musician, on banjo. They sing Let's Go Fucking Mental, which they describe as a \"beer chucker\" anthem, with Ifans screaming the word \"mental!\" 27 times as the song clatters to a halt. All told, it should be a disaster. In fact, it's brilliant. Like the Happy Mondays, the band have a shambolic magnetism, the sheer strength of their tunes providing a centre of gravity in all the chaos.</p> <p>In the pub in London I had asked Ifans about the lyrics to Last Man Standing, which, melody-wise, is a breezy pop song: \"If I only had my crack pipe it just might have kept me sane\", it begins, \"instead of picking up the toaster and toasting half my brain.\" Can he remember how those lyrics came up?</p> <p>\"Uh, I can, yeah...\" begins Ifans. \"It was during the time when I was hanging out with Pete Doh...\" He stops and scratches his Worzel Gummidge hair. \"It was... It came...\"</p> <p>Was it inspired by the environment you were in at the time?</p> <p>\"No, it was inspired by the cult...\" He tails off again.</p> <p>The cult of Pete Doherty?</p> <p>\"No, the cult, the culture of that time... That whole obsession with... The crack pipe has never kept anyone sane. There's a lot of stuff in there that is very raw, lyrically. And there's a lot of stuff that is just complete and utter situationist mischief.\"</p> <p>What category does that line fall into?</p> <p>\"Em...\" Ifans pauses. \"Mischief,\" he says finally, twice. \"We had this debate when we were writing lyrics: are we swearing too much? Not because we think swearing is wrong, but is it lazy?\" In the end, The Peth's attitude to lyrics can be summed up as \"Oh, just keep it in. We're not Radiohead,\" says Ifans with his lazy, vulpine smile. \"We're not poets.\"</p> <p>The day after Portmeirion, The Peth hit the small town of Bala. And Bala hits them back: Rhys Ifans gets in a fight with a local chip-shop owner, while two other members of the band are visited in their hotel room by the local constabulary. There is, as Ifans later describes it, \"claret all over the room.\" The police tell The Peth to \"have some breakfast, have a drink, and get out of town.\"</p> <p><strong>Thursday July 10: Blossom Street Studios and Hoxton Square Bar &amp; Kitchen, Shoreditch, London</strong></p> <p>The Peth straggle into a studio for the Weekend photoshoot. Rhys Ifans is wearing many of the same clothes he had on the previous week. But his T-shirt is new. With evident pride he says that a couple of fans made it for him. \"Ccadw Dy Fw*in Fish\" (\"Stuff Your Fucking Fish\"), it says, which is what - according to the papers - \"jilted star\" Ifans shouted at the Bala chip-shop owner.</p> <p>Nine-tenths of The Peth are wearing sunglasses. The only one who isn't is the one who's not actually in the band; he's a mate, and he's pretending to be the drummer, who's gone awol. </p> <p>\"It's the first time I've been on stage as me,\" reflects Ifans, of the Welsh shows. \"And this may sound such a naff thing, but in the initial daze of nervousness, because I didn't have a character, the sunglasses became so important. I did two gigs in girls' pink sunglasses. I've got to wean myself off the shades.\"</p> <p>Everyone drinks Kronenbourg, which has been hastily fetched by a studio assistant. Someone is rolling a joint. The attention span of this dirty near-dozen is not lengthy. A lone voice suggests they all stand in a long line for the photographer \"and someone will snort you\". </p> <p>\"I'll do that!\" bellows Ifans.</p> <p> The video for Let's Go Fucking Mental is being made by artists Jake and Dinos Chapman. \"I was hoping they'd just give me a mannequin with a cock coming out its head... We do share a very similar sense of humour,\" says Ifans. </p> <p>They first met when all three were hired by Italian fashion label Missoni. \"They do horrible clothes, but they wanted non-model models and they flew us out to Milan and said you can have some free clobber. Well, I'll go anywhere for free clobber. So it was me, Jake and Dinos and some other people I didn't know, and we had to do a catwalk show. We could barely walk in a straight line. </p> <p>\"So they're old friends,\" he continues. \"And I'm a fan of their work. But they wouldn't have offered to do this if they didn't like the music. They're very particular people.\"</p> <p>In fact, the Peth video commission - the first the brothers have accepted - is something of a favour returned. The Chapmans are currently making their own quasi-autobiographical film, featuring Ifans as their dad and Samantha Morton as their mum (next year, Ifans will also star in the brothers' first \"proper\" film, as an art critic). In return, Ifans asked if the Chapmans would make The Peth's music video.</p> <p>Ifans pulls up a still from the Chapmans' biopic on his mobile phone. It shows him and Morton standing beneath a giant model of a vaginal passage.</p> <p>Ifans says: \"It's the first time in my life where I'm not the biggest cunt in the room.\" </p> <p>Photoshoot quickly over, the band straggle out for the short walk to the Hoxton Square Bar &amp; Kitchen, venue for tonight's London debut. Their guest list numbers 260. \"Yeah,\" sniffs Ifans, \"if you want to rob Primrose Hill, tonight's the night.\"</p> <p>Sure enough, when The Peth take to the stage in the tiny sweat box, the audience includes Kate Moss and Sadie Frost dancing at the front, while The Charlatans' Tim Burgess and former Libertine Carl Bar\u00e2t linger near the back. </p> <p>As in Portmeirion, the gig teeters on the edge of sozzled chaos: on Let's Go Fucking Mental, Ifans manages to scream \"mental!\" only 17 times, while on bluesy ballad Stonefinger he seems to lose the plot entirely.</p> <p><strong>Monday July 28: Final Cut edit suite and Soho House, Soho, London</strong></p> <p>Is Stonefinger about you-know-who? The opening lines are: \"Every little thing you said would break me, all of it came true / Every bit of love I give, you mock it, yes you do...\" </p> <p>Thus far, I've been loth to mention Sienna Miller. In Portmeirion, a journalist from music magazine Q asked Ifans about his ex; Ifans responded by walking out. But at our first meeting, in the pub, when I suggested that Ifans sounds completely broken when he sings Stonefinger, he replied: \"I was, I was in a bad way... Heartbroken. It's a diary, in a way, this album. Coz I've been through several states of mind through the process...\" </p> <p>The Golden Mile has taken the best part of two years to make, with studio sessions in Cardiff fitted around other commitments. On the day they recorded Stonefinger, Ifans \"fell off the train, fell into the room, Daf stuck a mic in my face, I thought it was a fucking ice-cream, I was that off me head.\" </p> <p>Since Stonefinger's public unveiling in Portmeirion, The Sun - alongside splashes about Miller and her supposed new beau Balthazar Getty - have been reporting that the song is about Miller.</p> <p>Ieuan says that he wrote half the album's lyrics on his own, but Ifans wrote some bits and bobs, including Stonefinger. While Ifans is off on the phone I ask Ieuan which lines are about Miller. \"None whatsoever,\" he replies emphatically. When Ifans returns, I ask him to tell me about Stonefinger.</p> <p>\"I'd split up with me girlfriend. No, no, not the little one,\" he says, meaning Miller, adding that the lyrics are approximately 18 months old. So are any of the album's lyrics about... \"No, no, fuck no,\" he interjects. \"Jesus Christ, no. She doesn't deserve a fucking song, that one.\" </p> <p>It's lunchtime, and we're on the roof terrace of Soho House. Ifans was unsure if we'd get in; he thought he might still be banned from the private members' club after an \"incident\" involving a \"small fire\". But Jake Chapman has smoothed our passage. </p> <p>We had met at an edit suite earlier in the day to see a rough-cut of the Chapmans' video. There had been no sign of Ifans - Ieuan had last seen him at four that morning, going off with \"some bird\". He finally rolls in nearly an hour late, full of apologies and with the address of the edit suite written on a pink, heart-shaped Post-it note pinned to his chest. His underpants are poking out of his back pocket.</p> <p>The current public view of Ifans, as filtered through the papers, is of a brokenhearted, unhinged man partying his way through a break-up, his bonkers band a convenient excuse for rock'n'roll excess. </p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" he says, the band has been a refuge during his recent troubles. \"It all had a kind of poetic symmetry. I'm not the kind to lie down on a couch... This band was bang on the right time.\" His impulse was to think, \"right, I'm going back to gang life.\" </p> <p>But for all the shambling mess that seems to attend him, like the dustcloud hovering above Peanuts' Pig-Pen, Ifans is serious about The Peth, and serious about it not being seen as a dilettantish excursion by a bored thespian. \"This is a proper band,\" he and Ieuan chorus. No one wants Ifans's celebrity status to get in the way - even though it inevitably does.</p> <p>At Soho House The Peth drink cider and Ifans waves his underpants about. Chapman goes off home, motorbike helmet in hand; unbeknown to him, Ifans has secreted his pants inside.</p> <p>In a short while, Chapman returns, and it's on to the pub, followed by Soho House again. And it's only six o'clock in the evening. I leave soon afterwards, waking up on a bus, some distance past my house, without my bag containing my laptop, iPod, house keys, sunglasses. The next day I make frantic phone calls to the rest of our party, trying to retrieve it. Apparently, most headed home in the early evening but Ifans and Chapman kept going. We know this because Ifans is in the next day's papers, careering out of nightclub Bungalow 8 at 3.30am, straight into another fight with photographers. The stories report that he spent the evening with Rod Stewart's daughter Kimberly - another attempt, they suggest, to \"bounce back from his split from Sienna Miller.\" </p> <p>Then Ifans disappears. For two days. No one can reach him - except the long arm of the tabloid lens. They photograph him and Stewart leaving her house and having \"nosh in a seedy Soho strip club\". </p> <p>Many phone calls later, I finally receive word that Ifans has my bag. Remarkably, everything is there. Except my sunglasses. I text Jake Chapman to thank him for all his efforts in trying to locate Ifans and my bag. Shame about the glasses, I say, but in the circumstances, it's not surprising they've been lost.</p> <p>Chapman texts back. \"Think you'll find your glasses on the front page of most tabloids...\"</p> <p>I look online. Sure enough, there on The Sun's Bizarre pages is Rhys Ifans, strolling with his latest flame, wearing my sunglasses. At the time of writing, he still hadn't returned them. Not weaned off the sunglasses yet, then.</p>",
  "<p>Oswald has been many things in - and after - his day: refugee, king, avenging angel, saint and now ... holiday provider to the indecisive. Suppose, for instance, that this summer you're torn between hitting the hills, getting some sea air in your lungs, and enjoying some nice gentle countryside. While once this impasse would have led to sleepless nights, nowadays St Oswald is on hand with his very own long distance footpath offering three days of blissful coastal rambling before heading for the hilly farm-laden delights of the Northumberland national park. </p> <p>So it was that I found myself one August morning walking barefoot across the North Sea in the rain - an experience that turned out to be much more pleasurable than it looks on paper. For one thing, the North Sea was out, thus exposing a full 2\u00bd miles of warm sand between Holy Island and the mainland. Furthermore, there's a bit where, at every step, I sank down to my ankles in deliciously rich black goo - the sort of heated mud therapy that people part with hundreds of pounds for. And as for the rain - well, since it was Holy Island, it felt appropriately cleansing.</p> <p>One of Britain's newest long distance paths, St Oswald's Way was created after a local vicar came up with the idea of a short trail linking churches with connections to the saint. Alnwick District Council ran with the idea, adding several other locations from Oswald's life. With an efficiency not readily associated with local government, they erected some excellent signposting, and produced an informative guide book and a pack of weather-proofed and pretty much indestructible maps, making it darn near impossible for even the most directionally challenged walker to get lost. </p> <p>St Oswald's Way may begin in a holy place and end 97 miles later at somewhere called Heavenfield, but it's by no means a pious pilgrimage. For a start, most of its route nominally recreates the journey he took from Bamburgh in 634 at the head of an army. Oswald's subsequent triumph in battle over the pagan Cadwallon aided the spread of Christianity in Britain and neatly secured his beatification. </p> <p>Happily, the atmosphere on Holy Island could hardly be less bellicose - even its castle has been prettified by Lutyens and made into a family home. And that's exactly the feel of the Caf\u00e9 BeanGoose where I was welcomed by Lesley and her two friendly black cats. One of Holy Island's oldest houses, my room had one of the largest beds on whose organic cotton sheets I've ever had the privilege of sprawling, and the view somehow crammed in both the attractive village square and the distant Farne Islands.</p> <p>Just around the corner lay the substantial ruins of a priory set up by Aidan (another saint in the making) at Oswald's request. Surprisingly, what with the village, the castle and the priory, there's still enough room on the island for a couple of farms. I passed a stall run by farmer Danny Hodgson offering pilgrims strawberries, raspberries and a range of veggies from beetroots to romanesque \"all picked this morning from the field behind us\" - instead of food miles think food yards.</p> <p>Bamburgh, the first port of call, announces itself with a colossus of a castle - imagine Windsor perched on a hill, given an entire coastline as its domain, and then painted in flesh tones. Inside, a team of archaeologists is digging under the castle's chapel. Oswald was dismembered after his death and one his of arms, encased in silver, may well have been lost at Bamburgh. It would be fun to think that the saint's relic had rolled behind an altar or something, though when I suggested this to an archaeologist called Paul, he claimed (falsely, surely) that he wasn't holding his breath.</p> <p>As a man of many parts, Oswald would no doubt have enjoyed the fact that his footpath divides neatly into six sections (with B&amp;Bs at the end of each) and two distinct halves. The first half, along the coast, is dotted with interesting towns and villages. There's Low-Newton-by-the-Sea, little more than an ancient horseshoe of cottages, where I joined contented holidaymakers outside the Ship Inn drinking in some sun and real ale from the pub's own micro-brewery; Craster, renowned for its kippers and appealing harbour; Alnmouth, memorably described by John Wesley as \"a small seaport town famous for its wickedness\" - though disappointingly, there wasn't so much as a saucy postcard by the time I got there; and Warkworth, still rightly dining out on its appearances in Shakespeare's Henry IV and from where you can take a beautiful crimson rowing boat on to the placid River Coquet. </p> <p>But even these highlights are eclipsed by the views. As I marched south they came at me from every angle. Look right, and there's the immense tabletop bulk of the Cheviot, a hill right on the Scots border. Look left and there are seas wider than nature intended studded with long-suffering rocks and tiny islands. Look straight ahead and sheltered sandy beaches spring out from under the cliffs, golden front lawns to a succession of towering castles. Jays and goldfinches compete for air space with squadrons of joyful swallows. Look down and the ground is alive with wildlife - three times I caught sight of wiry ginger weasels crossing my path before disappearing into murky tangles of bracken and bramble.</p> <p>Compared with the hustle and bustle of the coast, the second half of the walk came as a shock. For three straight days I tramped for periods of three to four hours without seeing another walker. This is very much Oswald in contemplative mode. After a day stalking the banks of the river Coquet (it rhymes with \"croak it\" rather than \"croquet\"), I spent a night in small, underrated Rothbury, a gently Victorian town packed with tiny shops and local goodwill. Then, without warning, the path surges up a cranesbill-flanked track into a wilderness of Technicolor purple hills, daunting forests and remote farmland. </p> <p>As I wandered down at last into somnolent Kirkwhelpington, my legs began to ache pleasantly. An elderly man kindly offered me a lift over the couple of miles from the path to my lodgings, an 18th-century farmhouse called Shieldhall, where my four-poster bed was a beautiful handmade copy of one found in the castle at Holy Island. I took a long bath and spend much of the evening thinking that I ought to visit the sumptuous guests' library on the other side of the courtyard but found myself mesmerised by the cascading rain, lost in the smug and happy feeling of being indoors and dry.</p> <p>The final day was a romp south through soothing farmland punctuated by the occasional deserted hamlet. The spell was only broken in the final few miles to Heavenfield, as the route piggybacks Hadrian's Wall Path. The military efficiency of the arrow-straight line is a fitting preparation for a visit to a battlefield, while journey's end is aptly marked with a large wooden cross replicating the one Oswald erected on the eve of the fight. It was at this point that his dying words came into their own: \"Oh Lord, have mercy on the soles of my people.\" It's possible he meant \"souls\", but by then my feet were begging to differ.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dixe Wills is the author of Places to Hide in England, Scotland and Wales (Icon, \u00a37.99).</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting there</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.nationalexpresseastcoast.com\">Nationalexpresseastcoast.com</a>, 08457 225225.

  "<p>Reading different western media sources, I - as a Russian who grew up in Ossetia - was struck by the fact that everyone rushed to accuse Russia of attacking the presumed-innocent Georgia; why does everyone forget that Georgia was the first to attack the peaceful town of Tskhinvali? I don't approve of any violence against civilians, but how could the Russian government leave its citizens to die in South Ossetia? We could not but send our troops there to protect women and children attacked by the Georgian army.</p> <p>I'm deeply hurt by the fact that we are so much hated by the whole world for protecting the innocent. My understanding is that each country is supporting Georgia for its own ends and really doesn't care about Georgia's population. Friends who saw the attacks on Tskhinvali have told me that Georgian tanks were running into women and children, and soldiers were finishing off the wounded and throwing grenades into cellars where civilians were hiding from the shooting. War is always violent, but why does everyone make a victim of the real aggressor, of the real fascist? I happen to love the Georgian people, they are as open and friendly as everyone in the small southern provinces of the former Soviet Union, but we are not to blame for their deaths in this war. Their president is. Please let the whole world see what is really going on; I only want to have justice and I want this bloody war over.<br><strong>Evgenia Kosyanova</strong><br>Vladikavkaz, Russia </p> <p>Many who write about Georgia these days are doing a disservice to truth and to the chances of a viable solution by whipping up anti-Russian hysteria. The calm reader might thus like to reflect more on the following facts:</p> <p>1. It was the Georgian president who began this crisis, seriously misjudging his opponent and weakening his own country. In the Japanese culture this would lead to hara-kiri; we in the west usually expect an honorable resignation.</p> <p>2. The US attempt in Bucharest last spring to add Georgia to Nato must not be forgotten. It was rightly seen by the Russians as an attempt to continue to destabilise them. Again American planners misjudged the power and character of Vladimir Putin; and both are formidable.</p> <p>3. The above were not isolated phenomena. For years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, American politicians have repeatedly been humiliating a nation which, whether we like it or not, is both great and proud. They are now reaping the whirlwind and, alas, so are we.</p> <p>4. Talk of violation of sovereignty has become meaningless after Iraq and Afghanistan, and the invasion of northern Cyprus, not to mention the repeated bombardments of Syria and Lebanon by Israel and its famous attack on Iraqi installations, which many of us fear it would like to repeat in Iran if given half a chance. State sovereignty is, indeed, sacred unless it is we who violate it!</p> <p>There is a growing feeling that the Bush administration is one of the worst in US history. Sensible Europeans should try to ensure that in its dying days America does not make matters worse; and if Europe cannot restrain its ally, it should stay clear of new American follies.<br><strong>Basil Markesinis</strong><br>Bicester, Oxfordshire </p> <p>The Polish/US joint decision to site interceptor missiles on Polish soil (US rules out military role in Georgia but warns Russia off, August 15) is ill-considered. However, the secondary decision to add Patriot missiles and create a permanent US military base in Poland is strategically provocative.</p> <p>There are already 800 US military bases in 63 countries, with upwards of 250,000 US military deployed worldwide. The US also claims strategic control of space. It is surely self-evident that the siting of yet another US military position close to the Russian border will be guaranteed to provoke an escalation in tensions and \"cold war\" rhetoric.</p> <p>The world desperately needs a different approach. \"Fear\" is a weapon of mass destruction and it is being evoked with increasing frequency, intensity and irresponsibility, driving up the geopolitical stakes and placing the chance of war higher and higher up the agenda. Defusion of such an acute danger is the key for our collective security. The real power needs to be with the peace brokers.<br><strong>Julian Rose<br></strong>Whitchurch-on-Thames, Oxfordshire</p>",
  "<p>At school, History and RE were not for me. Arthur Price, who also taught us Maths and PE, approached all his subjects with the same small-town Victorian vigour: \"No stories. No romance. Facts, lad, facts.\" Arthur was an enthusiastic administrator of the slipper, so I left formal education with few facts imprinted on my brain, but with Adidas stamped on my backside. Those were the days.</p> <p>Buried behind Arthur's forgettable dates and turgid names were stories of real people, from real places like south-east Turkey. The Greeks called it \"Between Two Rivers\", those rivers being the mighty Tigris and Euphrates. South-east Turkey is where Mesopotamia starts, and where human history starts, too. In the last five days, I've driven through 13,000 years of invasion, conquest and treaties between Hurrians and Hittites, Assyrians and Arameans, Urartuans, Medes, Scythians and Chaldeans to name but a few. And that lot were here long before the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Crusaders, Ottomans, Turks and Kurds ...</p> <p>Those peoples' descendants still live their lives here. There are dark, bristly Arabs and fair skinned, pale-eyed Arabs, you see high Asian cheekbones and people with the straight noses shown on Hittite reliefs. Fashions and shopping habits have changed little, too: over there I see a headdress worn just as the Virgin Mary would have worn hers; dinner last night was a mess of lentil pottage; the market where I'm sipping tea saw the Three Kings pass through on their way to pick up some birthday presents. Yes, Arthur - history is breathing, smelling, eating, laughing and shouting, and still being made every day in Upper Mesopotamia. Though pilgrims, merchants and armies have come here forever, to travel the area today is to be marvelled at and welcomed simply for being foreign.</p> <p>Diyarbakr airport isn't too pretty, but it does have a tethered goat to keep the grass down. The city is worth a quick gawp at the world's oldest city walls, splendidly built in local black basalt by the Romans (and still the second longest fortification after the Great Wall of China). It was also worth making a little time for a nice spicy breakfast in the 15th century caravansaray that once held 500 horses, and now holds knick-knacks for religious tourists visiting the city's grand, solid Ulu mosque, which was built in 639 over the church where Saint Thomas preached his gospel. All this history, and it's still only breakfast time.</p> <p>The road east to Batman offered a blissful breeze after the heat of Diyarbakr. Turkey's topography is exceptionaly varied, and rarely more so than here in the south east. Around every bend there's a change of scenery: rolling wheat prairie becomes sharp limestone escarpments pocked here and there with neolithic caves; bare high mountains become ranges of scrubby forest; great fields of boulders seemingly scattered by the moon god become water meadows lush with wild thyme. The roads are quiet, save for labouring lorries, elderly cars, biblical flocks of bell-jangling goats and sheep and the occasional coachload of Iranian pilgrims travelling to pay their respects at the tomb of the Prophet Ali's grandson.</p> <p>In this hot dry region, water equals power. The Malabadi bridge is the less famous twin of the bridge at Mostar. It's overlooked by a rudimentary tea house that offers a gorgeous view of the widest arch of any stone bridge anywhere. A masterpiece of elegant functionality, it housed rooms for travellers and toll collectors. For the Arthur Prices among us, it was built in 1147 by the Artuqids. Behind it, a dam now holds back much of the river.</p> <p>Dams are making tomorrow's history throughout Upper Mesopotamia. The GAP project, with EU backing, is a series of 40 or so dams on the Tigris and Euphrates and their tributaries. Good thinking, on the surface: provide cheap greenish power, irrigate land previously unfarmable, become the bread-basket of the Near and Middle East, oh - and turn off the water to pesky Syria and oil-rich Northern Iraq whenever you want. There is another cost. The Roman resort at Zeugma is already mostly under water due to GAP, though a bit of emergency archaeology saved its most ravishing mosaics, which now moulder in the museum in Gaziantep. Zeugma, of course, was built on a much older site, whose secrets will now never be told. </p> <p>Next to be submerged is Hasankeyf. The Tigris laps the old town's broad shores, and it is expected that work will start on a dam next year whose waters will come up to the speakers at the top of its tallest minaret. </p> <p>Down near the Iraqi border, Midyat's population is mostly Jacobite Christian, whose craftsmen specialise in filigree silver, and have done since the third century. Churches in town have bushy vines planted right up to their pale walls. Outside Midyat, sternly isolated, powerful and massive, is Mor Gabriel. Constructed in 297, it is probably the world's oldest functioning monastery. Here, and at the larger, more-visited Deyrul Zafaran, the sense of clean cool calm is striking, especially in light of the sledgehammer heat outside. The Metropolitan, devilishly funky in his red soutane and black headgear showed me the chapel where, after his death, and like his hundreds of predecessors, he'll be entombed, sat upon his throne. The Jacobite Church conducts its liturgy in Aramaic, the language that Jesus spoke. On the streets of Midyat and nearby Mardin, you're as likely to hear Aramaic spoken as Kurdish, Turkish or Arabic. Having climbed hundreds of steps in 46C for my tour, I found the man on the door of Deyrul Zafaran, who has lived 65 of his 70 years inside the place, didn't have a word of Turkish, let alone English. </p> <p>Plantations of pistachios give way to camel and shale desert from which sprouts the huge hill around whose base the city of Mardin clings like barnacles to a rock. From Mardin's hugger-mugger streets you gaze at the Syrian plain whose dust means that when it rains here, it rains red mud. There's the jumble of ancient tongues on the air, and the smell of grilling lamb: Mardin's kebabs are biblically delicious, and served on pillows of beige-flecked lavash bread. I have three portions at Rido's hole-in-the-city-wall place with a salad of onion, parsley and sumac, imagining that this is food Jesus would have eaten, unless he was vegetarian. </p> <p>Mardin is a wonderful place to get lost in. Alleys just wide enough for a laden donkey duck under thousand-year-old houses. Sieve-makers, laurel soap-boilers, copper-tinners and limestone-carvers ply their ancient trades to a timeless mercantile rhythm. Old men tell old tales outside old shops. Gods, kings, the rich and the virtuous are remembered here in delicately-carved stone. There's even a stylised rendition of the Pepsi logo, making me wonder whether brands are the new gods. </p> <p>Ancient kings were great at branding themselves: take King Antiochus of the Commagenes in the 1st century BC. He had super-size bas-reliefs erected (see the one at Arsemia, if you can) of himself shaking hands on equal terms with Hercules. Antiochus' grandest branding exercise, though, is on Mount Nemrut (Nimrod). Nemrut is fiercely steep, high and magnificently inhospitable. Starting at 3am, and wearing cold-weather clothes, I climbed to 2,200m with a straggle of other tourists. It was worth it: sunrise reveals this stunning meglomaniacal memorial. A pantheon of gods including Lion, Eagle, Hercules and old Antiochus himself stare blindly at the dramatic landscape below. Their exquisitely carved mighty heads alone are 2m tall; earthquakes have scattered them to the ground.</p> <p>Legend (not fact, lad) has it that Nimrod, displeased at his daughter following Abraham's monotheism, had our forefather hurled into a fire. Where his limbs fell, water appeared, his limbs turning into fish. Today, carp fill Abraham's pool in Urfa. The atmosphere in Urfa's old city is quietly carnival, with pilgrims shopping the Silk Route bazaars and strolling the lake, its mosques, churches and garden-lined environs before ducking into the cave where Abraham was born to pay their respects. Urfa (then called Edessa) is where Jesus sent a healing cloth bearing his image to the ailing Osroene King Agbar. Another example of branding, perhaps. It's a lovely peaceful city that hums with belief, and throbs with desert heat. A five-minute drive takes me to the cave where Job learned his patience, and to his tomb next door. There's a chicken doner stand outside, but a queue, so I head down to Harran. </p> <p>Harran (Carrhae in the Bible) was Jethro's city, and here he gave Moses his rod. It was also where Noah's grandson Canaan built the first city following the flood. I ponder the ironies of Harran and Hasankeyf, admire the first ever Islamic university and the straw-brick beehive houses where I'm induced to enter by a blue-eyed Arab wearing the typical lavender-coloured headdress of the area. He has his daughter serve me strong murra coffee and tries to sell me some \"antiquities\". I get up to leave. \"Why rush?\" he says: \"We've been here 9,000 years.\"</p> <p>Nine millennia is nothing next to Gobekli Tepe, a mound being excavated between sparse wheat fields down a wildly bumpy, unsigned track. This part of Turkey has 400 such tumuli, but so far there's only been time to excavate 23 of them. Gobekli Tepe rewrites history, being the oldest known neolithic temple by 2,000 years. From around 10,500BC, hunter gatherers gathered here for communal worship. The quality of stone-masonry and the bas-relief artistry is breathtaking. There's a steam bath, a sacred birthing area, superbly stylised images of animals and a rough portakabin where a German archaeologist lives half the year. There's no guide book or tourist bling - yet - but instead there's the hill breeze and a strong sense of how amazing and sophisticated our ancestors were. </p> <p>My tour finishes in Gaziantep, near the Syrian border, where you feel that Mesopotamia meets the Mediterranean region. Antioch (now called Hatay) is down the road, or you could drive further on to Saint Paul's Tarsus, where Anthony and Cleopatra frolicked in the baths, but, you know, there's only so much world-making history your brain can take, so instead I lose myself in a plate of baklava, a dish most probably invented here. </p> <p>Over a second serving of superbly light, buttery confections, I think that if history teaches us anything it is that the story of the past is not necessarily a record of the past, but a version of it. History makers simply get us to inhabit their stories. The bare, hot, rich land of Upper Mesopotamia has been continuously inhabited for at least 12,500 centuries, which makes 456,250,000 days.

  "<p>Ribena was the superior fruit drink of my youth, and over the years I've consumed a fair amount of blackcurrants in liquid form, though more as cassis in kir and the like. I've even tried to make cassis with blackcurrants from the solitary bush in my garden, but it wasn't a success. But until meeting Edward Thompson, engineer, fruit farmer and guiding force of Pixley Berries, I'd never given much thought to cordial production or growing blackcurrants on a large scale. </p> <p>And here they were, row upon row of them, different varieties with different qualities, with names such as Ben Hope, Ben Tirran, Ben Gairn and Pixley Black, 300 acres of them in all. There were raspberries and apples, too, but the blackcurrants are the backbone of this business.</p> <p>\"Ribena is God,\" Thompson said. He's a tall man, with unruly, white hair, a ruddy face and an insistent enthusiasm for his products. \"It's easy to criticise them, but they've put a lot of money into research and development. And we supply them with a lot of blackcurrants. But Ribena is a clear cordial, which means it's been refined to take out the natural cloudiness of the juice. And the more you refine something, the more you take out the flavour. And I'm preoccupied by flavours. Pixley Berries cordial is cloudy, and I'd say it packs more flavour.\"</p> <p>Thompson is especially fond of the Pixley Black, which he selected after a worldwide search, having become concerned about the effect that global warming was having on the seasons (less winter chill, more summer heat). This, he felt, is a superior blackcurrant - superior in flavour, that is, not in productivity. \"Here,\" he said, stripping off a handful of plump berries, \"try them.\" </p> <p>They burst easily in my mouth, and sent the sweet/sour juice gushing down my throat. The flavour was as full and rich as the fruit looked. \"See?\" Thompson said.</p> <p>The thing about blackcurrants, it seems, is not only do different varieties taste different - \"The question is, do they taste good?\" Thompson said - but they have different ripening times, because they have different time clocks and respond differently to different temperatures, which differ according to which field they grow in, because fields have different microclimates. \"Vive la diff\u00e9rence,\" Thompson said.</p> <p>No, his currants aren't organic. For all its robust flavour, the blackcurrant is a delicate shrub, prone to spider mite, leaf spot and aphids, but they'd cut down pesticides and built a cordon sanitaire of hedgerow and grass around each field to promote bird life and insects that feed on insects that would otherwise infest the crop.</p> <p>Then, from July to August, pickers strip the fruit from the bushes, using machinery that Thompson adapted for the purpose - in a former incarnation, he had an engineering business. The pickers, as seems customary these days, come from eastern Europe, in some cases two or more generations of them. (It makes you wonder what will become of British agriculture, not to mention our restaurants, hotels and hospitals, when the xenophobia promoted by a sad alliance of cheap politicians and cheaper newspapers reduces the flow of itinerant labour on which we rely to do the jobs we are too lazy or too snooty to do ourselves. But that is by the by.)</p> <p>Then it's off to the juicing plant, all gleaming stainless steel and the heady smell of fruit. Even here, the fruit is treated with kid gloves, allowing time for maceration and natural filtration, so that the cordials retain the oomph of the natural fruit, ready for bottling as pure blackcurrant cordial, or mixed with juice from the farm's Cox's apples or elderflower or Scottish raspberry juice. Or champagne, cider, white wine or gin, come to that. (\"We do try to be different,\" Thompson said. \"We have to.\") Or poured over ice cream. Or... well, I'm sure you get the picture.</p>",
  "<p>The risk of a new era of east-west confrontation triggered by Russia's invasion of Georgia heightened yesterday when Moscow reserved the right to launch a nuclear attack on Poland because it agreed to host US rockets as part of the Pentagon's missile shield.</p> <p>As Washington accused Russia of \"bullying and intimidation\" in Georgia and demanded an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from the small Black Sea neighbour, Russia's deputy chief of staff turned on Warsaw and said it was vulnerable to a Russian rocket attack because of Thursday's pact with the US on the missile defence project.</p> <p>\"By deploying, Poland is exposing itself to a strike - 100%,\" warned Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn. He added that Russia's security doctrine allowed it to use nuclear weapons against an active ally of a nuclear power such as America.</p> <p>The warning worsened the already dismal mood in relations between Moscow and the west caused by the shock of post-Soviet Russia's first invasion of a foreign country.</p> <p>There were scant signs of military activity on the ground in Georgia, but nor were there any signs of the Russian withdrawal pledged on Tuesday under ceasefire terms mediated by the European Union.</p> <p>Instead, the focus was on a flurry of diplomatic activity that exposed acute differences on how Washington and Berlin see the crisis in the Caucasus.</p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, went to Tbilisi to bolster Georgia against the Russians as President George Bush denounced Russian \"bullying and intimidation\" as \"unacceptable\".</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, met Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev on the Black Sea close to Georgia's borders and sent quite a different message, offering a mild rebuke of Moscow.</p> <p>\"Some of Russia's actions were not proportionate,\" she said.</p> <p>Unlike the Americans and some European states who are saying the Russians should face \"consequences\" for their invasion, Merkel said negotiations with Moscow on a whole range of issues would continue as before and spread the blame for the conflict. \"It is rare that all the blame is on one side. In fact, both sides are probably to blame. That is very important to understand,\" she said.</p> <p>In Tbilisi, Rice was much more forthright, saying that the invasion had \"profound implications for Russia ... This calls into question what role Russia really plans to play in international politics.</p> <p>\"You can't be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours.\"</p> <p>The Russians have been refusing to pull back their forces in Georgia until President Mikheil Saakashvili signed the six-point ceasefire plan arranged by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France earlier this week, although the Russians had refused to sign it themselves.</p> <p>Saakashvili signed yesterday, while accusing the Russians of being \"evil\" and \"21st century barbarians\". Rice said Medvedev had also signed it.</p> <p>\"Russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west. It's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere,\" said Saakashvili. \"We are looking evil directly in the eye. Today this evil is very strong, and very dangerous for everybody, not just for us.\"</p> <p>Rice's show of solidarity with Georgia's beleaguered president was theatrically undermined when Russia dispatched a column of armoured personnel carriers towards the Georgian capital.</p> <p>As the talks were taking place, 10 armoured personnel carriers laden with Russian troops set off from Gori, penetrating to within 20 miles of Tbilisi.</p> <p>\"Georgia has been attacked. Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once,\" said Rice. The withdrawal \"must take place, and take place now ... This is no longer 1968,\" she added in reference to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago next week.</p> <p>The ceasefire terms favour the Russians who routed the Georgians. But the secretary of state argued the plan would not affect negotiations over the central territorial dispute between Georgia and the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The deal allows Russian troops to remain in the two provinces and to mount patrols and \"take additional security measures\" on Georgian territory beyond the two enclaves.</p> <p>Senior Russians continued to insist yesterday that Russian troops had not stepped outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia despite the fact they have been deep inside Georgian territory in several places all week.</p> <p>\"Our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone,\" said Sergei Ivanov, the deputy prime minister.</p> <p>Moscow also indicated it would resist possible European attempts to deploy international peacekeepers in the contested territories.</p> <p>\"We are not against international peacekeepers,\" the Russian president said. \"But the problem is that the Abkhazians and the Ossetians do not trust anyone except Russian peacekeepers.\" He also attacked the agreement between Washington and Warsaw on the missile shield and said claims that the shield was aimed at Iran were \"fairy tales\"</p> <p>\"This clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti-missile forces in Europe has as its aim the Russian Federation,\" said Medvedev. \"The moment has been well chosen.\"</p> <p>The timing of Thursday's agreement on missile defence means that tensions are soaring on Russia's southern and western borders.</p> <p>Polish armed forces yesterday paraded in Warsaw to mark a rare defeat of the Russians 88 years ago and President Lech Kaczynski hailed the accord on the Pentagon project as a boost for Poland's security.</p> <p>In return for hosting 10 interceptor rockets said to be intended to destroy any eventual ballistic missile attacks from Iran, Poland is to receive a battery of US Patriot missiles for its air defences and has won a mutual security pact with Washington.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday August 18 2008. In the article above we said that Polish armed forces paraded in Warsaw to mark a rare defeat of the Russians 888 years ago. We meant to say 88 years ago. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>While many of those crammed onto Bournemouth beach this week seemed reluctant to shed their T-shirts or hooded tops, as if they did not quite believe that the sun was out, there was little grumbling and plenty of evidence that tourism is booming.</p> <p>Thursday afternoon was a rare bright spot in a miserable August - the first 12 days has already seen 84% of the rainfall expected for the month. </p> <p>Sean Balmain had come all the way from Edinburgh but despite the weather he believed it was preferable to going abroad.</p> <p>\"We've got two kids and the thought of dragging them onto a plane is not very appealing. It's also pretty expensive.\"</p> <p>So far there had only been a couple of days of beach weather but he said the family were not drawn to Bournemouth only for its coastline.</p> <p>Dave Kelly, 39, enjoying the sights from Bournemouth pier with his wife and nine-year-old son, said: \"If it came to a competition between here and Greece or Cyprus, on the beach they would win. But you've got the New Forest here, there's far more to do than go on the beach.\"</p> <p>Lilian Kenneth, 58, from Hertfordshire, basking in the sun while her grandchildren played nearby on the beach, said her family had to put up their tent in driving rain but it had not spoilt her enjoyment. \"I haven't had a holiday in the UK for a long time. You realise you don't need to go abroad,\" she said.</p> <p>A number of seafront businesses were less cheery. Ice cream seller Mark Speight said he had taken \u00a319 on one day this week, against a nice hot day when he could earn about \u00a31,000. </p> <p>But at a nearby indoor attraction, the Oceanarium, marketing manager Sara Daintree conceded, \"We do better in bad weather.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Vegas Blade Horror Song!\" shrieks the tabloid newspaper pop page as the man who wrote said Blade Horror Song, James Allan from stunning Glaswegian reality-rock visionaries Glasvegas, scans the report in huge-eyed disbelief. </p> <p>\"Soaring Scots Glasvegas have written a song in response to Britain's knife-crime epidemic,\" yodels the Scottish Sun, alongside the full lyrics for a song called Stabbed, lyrics which James describes as a \"poem\". The song, a spoken-word monologue of eerie dread over the exquisitely doomed piano reverie of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata was written, in fact, three years ago. \"The thought-provoking track,\" avers the Sun, \"centres on a gang of youths who set upon an unknown victim. Lyrics include \"I'm gonna get stabbed/No cavalry could ever save me' and 'Now I'm running for my life'.\" </p> <p>\"That is mad,\" chirps James, cheerily, \"but it's a good poem!\" </p> <p>Paul Donoghue, 24, Glasvegas bass player with a large front tooth comically missing (from a fight three years ago, \"but I got loads of money for it\") ponders the knife-crime \"epidemic\". </p> <p>\"It's been in the news a lot in London,\" he says, \"but in Glasgow it's always been like that. If you grow up in Glasgow, you've been chased with something. I've been chased with a five iron!\" </p> <p>A member of the Glasvegas crew peers over James' shoulder. \"It's not very often,\" he smiles ruefully, \"you see the word 'thought-provoking' in the Sun...\" </p> <p>It's not very often a debut album emerges which synchronises with the very atmosphere a generation is living in. Glasvegas' debut is so spookily resonant it's almost prophetic, a debut album which isn't about escape, oblivion and forgetting about the news but actually facing the news; from a teenage boy's murder (the devastating Flowers &amp; Football Tops), to the \"angel\" in your life not being your lover but your social worker (the gallows-hilarious Geraldine), to absentee fathers (the profoundly poignant Daddy's Gone). If the words are introspective, the sound is anything but: a colossal oncoming tsunami of guitars with drums as tall as tenements, five decades of classic atmospherics crashing on the shore of 2008 through the monumental shimmers of Phil Spector, the Shangri-La's, the Ramones, Joy Division and the Jesus And Mary Chain. There are also anthemic sing-along terrace chants and the most affecting working-class vocal howl since Liam Gallagher in 1994, sung in an unreconstructed accent which makes the Proclaimers sound like The Queen. </p> <p>Ian McCulloch, Echo And The Bunnymen elder, calls them \"the best band since Nirvana\", they call themselves \"a rock'n'roll band\" but, really, they're a soul band. </p> <p>In a drizzly concrete car park in south-west London, outside the vast ex-brewery warehouse which houses Channel 4's Transmission, James Allan, 28, sits inside the TV crew's catering van and proves himself a cheerful, gentle, contemplative soul as curiously vague as a cloud. Since last November's release of single Daddy's Gone (\"I won't be the lonely one/Sitting on my own and sad/A 50-year-old reminiscing what I had\"), a re-recording of which is released next week, he's seen the foaming bedlam of a label-bid piranha pool, a typhoon of media hype and remained serenely oblivious to all of it: \"If you believe all that you also have to believe you were rubbish five months ago when nobody cared.\" James - with a 50s quiff, dressed all in black, a hole at the collar of his plain black T-shirt - bears an almost alarming resemblance to the late Joe Strummer. There's no piercingly politicised angry young man here, mind, more a hippy-dude humanitarian who calls himself \"a pure daydreamer\", who appears to have no clue whatsoever of the importance of what he's created. When the album is released next month (recorded in New York with Franz Ferdinand producer Rich Costey) Glasvegas will be known, perhaps, as The Sound Of Blade Britain. </p> <p>\"Really?\" balks James, bewildered, \"I just wanted to express ideas and be sincere, as long as it was real to me. Why these themes? I don't really know why. To be honest, you don't think that far down the line, that people are even going to hear these songs.\" </p> <p>He contemplates the epic Flowers &amp; Football Tops, lyrically inspired by the racially motivated murder of 15 year old Glaswegian Kriss Donald (abducted near James's home in March 2004, stabbed 13 times, drenched in petrol and set alight) from the point of view of a mother waiting for her son to come home.</p> <p>\"I'm just not a very numb person,\" he blinks. \"And when you're not very numb the downfall is you're too sensitive to human things. Certain things are just so heartbreaking they stay in my mind and I can't shake them off: the hurt, the fear or the euphoria. And so you sit down with a guitar and it pours out of your brain.\" </p> <p>For years, on the dole in Glasgow, he'd listen to \"the tranny\" (the transistor radio, not the transvestite) and hear \"people singing about limousines and girls and I thought, 'Pfff, people are never gonna get my stuff, it's me that's wrong'\" until buying a Hank Williams compilation with Christmas vouchers in December 2006, \"which had 20 tracks and every title had 'lonesome' or 'cry' and I thought, 'He knows who he is and it's all right, so don't be so hard on yourself'\". </p> <p>James is, in fact, your genuine creative eccentric, a pale man newly returned from a week's holiday in blistering Barcelona which he spent \"in the shade, on Valium, so I could cope with the heat. I'm from Dalmarnock man!\" Dalmarnock, in Glasgow's ever-beleaguered, working-class east end, he describes as \"exotic\" and \"beautiful\" with no sarcasm intended. \"It's relative, I grew up there so I see the beauty; I love the grey, I love the rain, I had loads of fun,\" he says. Leaving school at 15, he played professional football for Falkirk and Gretna \"until music started taking over\". Besotted with Elvis, 50s rockabilly and the early-60s, his favourite album was and remains Phil Spector's A Christmas Gift For You. He played it all year round \"really loud, so all my neighbours knew me as the crazy kid who played Christmas albums in the summer. I love Christmas, it's dark but everything's glittering.\"</p> <p>Around 2005, the fledgling Glasvegas was James and his cousin Rab Allan (their mums are twins), eventually recruiting Rab's old schoolmate Paul on bass and Caroline McKay on drums, who James met in Glasgow's vintage clothes shop Mr Ben. She had zero drum experience. \"I knew she'd be good,\" chirps Rab, \"because when she's so drunk she can't speak, she dances like an angel.\" She drums standing up. \"Because I'm so short,\" smiles Caroline, \"you wouldn't see me otherwise.\" At exactly five feet, she's one inch shorter than Kylie. \"Haven't got her arse, though,\" she quips. Rab, meanwhile, was a labourer while Paul was a ceramic tiler. \"The only reason I liked it,\" grins Paul, \"was because you were on a massive building site so you could smoke dope and hide! The building trade's more rock'n'roll than rock'n'roll...\" </p> <p>James thinks about his music, notes Rab, \"24/7, we hear him talking about it in his sleep\", music which, far from glorifying horror, looks for hope. Does James think Britain is Broken? </p> <p>\"Is Britain broken?\" he muses, having clearly never considered it. \"In Britain, like a lot of places in the world, you've got two elements together: the darkest gothic horror movie and the most beautiful romantic one like Casablanca.\" He ponders the relentless knife-crime news reports and suddenly looks forlorn. \"I guess there's a big list of potential roots to the problem,\" he decides. \"There are definitely frustrations in the youth which have been in our culture for quite a while. But no matter how many times you read about it, it strikes you with total shock, the lack of humanity. Or like I say in Ice Cream Van [the album's closing hymnal, which sounds like the Requiem mass for morality itself] 'pure community, freedom of faith, act of citizenship'. Y'know, there's no-one's actually saying, 'Grow a heart, man'. How could you actually harm another person? What's happening to us man?\" </p> <p>Glasvegas were all born in the 80s, and are, notes James, \"a weird band of weird people with a weird sound\" who are, fittingly, about to record a Christmas album in a cathedral in Transylvania. \"One song,\" swoons Rab, \"is the best song James has ever written. It's called Cruel Moon, just him and the piano and it's really quite frightening. I think it could be Christmas number one.\" </p> <p>Today, they've a new friend in Lisa Marie Presley who phoned James up after hearing Daddy's Gone, igniting the rumour she'll soon cover it (with surely world-boggling results). \"Naaaaah,\" chokes the ever-humble James, \"I very much doubt it!\" The debut album's artwork, meanwhile, has now been decided, without the spectre of a blade in sight. </p> <p>\"It's based,\" twinkles James, \"on Vincent Van Gogh's The Starry Night. It's beautiful.\" </p> <p>Vincent, you'd imagine, the very emblem of excavating beauty from insanity, would definitely approve.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Daddy's Gone is out Aug 24. Glasvegas play Leeds Festival on Friday and Reading Festival next Sunday. The album Glasvegas is out Sep 8</p>",
  "<p>Hi, I'm from the internet and I'm an arrogant, abusive, annoying git who runs a website called Speak You're Branes. I actually prefer the domain name, <a href=\"http://www.ifyoulikeitsomuchwhydontyougolivethere.com\">ifyoulikeitsomuchwhydontyougolivethere.com</a>. See, already I've gone and used a term like \"domain name\", but you're reading the Guardian and have unlimited broadband so you can probably cope with that, can't you? You big, organic shandy drinker.</p> <p>I created my website about 18 months ago in a (failed) attempt to cure myself of a shameful addiction. I was addicted to clicking around the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/default.stm\">\"Have Your Say\" section</a> of the BBC's website. In case you're not familiar with it, it's the bit of the site where someone at the Beeb asks a question like \"Are radical Muslim clerics interfering with your wheelie bin collection schedule?\" and then a gang of multi-chinned nincompoops compete to see who can get the most startlingly stupid, pompous or racist response past the moderators. Back then I was only spending a couple of hours a week sifting through the deranged mooing. Occasionally I'd pull out a particularly entertaining example and mail it to a few friends. Eventually, I think one of them asked me to stop and so I started collecting them on a website instead. </p> <p>It's turned out to be strangely popular. Being brilliant, I've had loads of ideas this good before but this is the first one where someone else hasn't got there first (as happened with eBay, iTunes, binge-drinking and dogging).</p> <p>I'm going to assume you're one of the small number of committedly unhip dudes who hasn't visited my site yet and tell you a little bit about the comments I collect.</p> <p>These people are all idiots. But that's not what I find funny about them. The thing that makes me laugh, endlessly, is that these self-absorbed cretins seem to believe that somebody important inside the internet cares what they think. Who do they think they're talking to? The Queen? Terry Wogan? Father Christmas? I can tell you, actually. They all think they're addressing Gordon Brown. This is about as sophisticated as their politics gets. The BBC = the state = Gordon Brown. Having their tragic witterings \"published\" on the BBC's site (THE BBC!!! THE ACTUAL BBC!!!!!) is, for them, a validation of their moronic opinion and as good as speaking directly to the prime minister.</p> <p>These people go beyond the curtain-twitching fear of those who believe what they read in newspapers. They are engaged in an endless game of prejudice-reinforcing Chinese whispers about Muslims, France, Iran, communism, immigrants, benefit fraud and paedophiles. They start off with a story about some bureaucratic parking regulation and end up fabricating an anecdote of \"political correctness gone mad\" where they claim that \"Brussels\" has arrested the Queen for using the word \"brainstorm\" instead of the official EU replacement term \"thinkspunk\".</p> <p>Let me give you some examples from the site:</p> <p>\"Infringement of human rights? Gay rights, women's rights, immigrants rights. What about OUR rights?<br><strong>BritSoldDownTheRiver</strong></p> <p>You're just not trying hard enough. You can't very well change your ethnicity and changing your sex is probably a little extreme. You can, however, go gay RIGHT NOW! All those human rights are there waiting for you if you'd only cruise down to the docks and pick up a handsome young sailor.</p> <p>On Great BRITISH patriotism:</p> <p>\"I join with many other posters here. The citizens who were born and bred in this country have far more RIGHTS to be looked after. WE have paid OUR taxes, and there are a lot of BRITISH people who are also on very low wages. Wages which, in many cases, have been driven down by the influx of migrant workers. Show these immigrants the door. It's not a case of being hard hearted about it. It's a case of putting BRITISH citizens (our own people) first in their own country.\"<br><strong>Ken Thompson</strong></p> <p>I reckon Ken pronounces \"BRITISH\" with the caps lock on. He doubles in volume and his voice goes up an octave every time he says it. His idea of a \"good night in\" is to watch Only Fools And Horses while screaming \"BRITAAAAAAIN\" into a bag of frozen Yorkshire puds.</p> <p>A snippet of Graham's life:</p> <p>\"I voted using the postal vote system. I didnt find it confusing but the papers were folded wrong and didnt fit in the supplied envelope properly.\"<br><strong>Graham, Edinburgh</strong></p> <p>Thanks G-Man. Do you have a blog I could subscribe to?</p> <p>Apart from ignorance, prejudice and plain weirdness, another feature common to many of the comments is astonishingly bollocks wordplay. Nobody ever writes \"New Labour\" or \"Gordon Brown\". These petty internet gnomes proudly write \"Nu LiarBore\", \"Gordon CLOWN\" or something similarly inventive and hilarious. You can almost see their smiles of satisfaction as they type it. Funny and subversive. Brilliant.</p> <p>Talking of subversive, I occasionally come across a comment so dangerous that the author fears it will be suppressed by the BBC (just in case it starts a revolution). Typically, the comment will start out with something about the \"namby pamby PC brigade\" whose political correctness is apparently stopping the truth being spoken, before claiming that \"Brown people spread MRSA\", and finally finishing off with a phrase that will only be read once it's been proved wrong: \"I bet this doesn't get published!\" Needless to say, the BBC is staffed exclusively by enviro-fascist do-gooder libruls who are part of the political correctness conspiracy that's been keeping white people down all these years.</p> <p>There's so much of this crap that I've actually got people helping me sift through it now. My addiction has become debilitating. I keep wondering, \"What will I do with my blog? What is it for?\" I'm still not sure. But it seems to have wangled me an invitation to speak my brain at you, the actual Guardian-reading do-gooder librul-Marxist member of the PC-brigade. So here I am, sat on a train, on my way to see friends down in fancy London, penning some words for the Guide and trying not to use the word \"cunt\" gratuitously. I bet this doesn't get published.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Speak You're Branes's collection of ignorance, narcissism, stupidity, hypocrisy and bad grammar from BBC Have Your Say can be found at <a href=\"http://ifyoulikeitsomuchwhydontyougolivethere.com/ \">ifyoulikeitsomuchwhydontyougolivethere.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Some of my older neighbours could remember Toll Bar in Doncaster flooding just after the war, but none of them expected it to happen again.</p> <p>On June 25 last year, I came home early from the college where I was doing an Art &amp; Design degree and found drains had blocked, the road in front of my house was disappearing and cars were ploughing through the torrent, spraying my house.</p> <p>The next day was wetter still, so I stayed at home with my teenage children, Ben and Sally, checking the local news on TV. Ominous weather reports led to a flood warning as a beck above the village burst its banks. We started to move what we could upstairs and, while Ben set out to collect sandbags, Sally and I watched the levels rise at either end of the road. At seven in the evening, the tides met outside our front door.</p> <p>We remained lighthearted, even as water started seeping up through the floor. Sally was trying to sweep it out of the door, and went off in a mock-flounce when I told her she was wasting her time.</p> <p>By midnight, police were stopping traffic at the top of the village. Sally and I waded up to find out if we were due to be evacuated, only to find the truck delivering sandbags had stalled in the water. Like pirates, we commandeered a rescue boat - \"I'm hijacking you,\" I said. Within the hour, the evacuation was in full swing and we were towed upstream to catch a bus to the nearby Salvation Army hall.</p> <p>We filled in forms and pumped up air beds, exchanging stories over tea and coffee with other escapees. </p> <p>At breakfast, reports started to circulate that the water was ceiling high, and there were rumours of looting. Nevertheless, spirits remained good, and I expected to be back home within a few weeks.</p> <p>It took a fortnight for the floodwaters to recede enough for us to return home and survey the damage. Every room brought fresh heartbreak. Family heirlooms had been ruined, my mother's pots and pans, which I'd used as a child, were contaminated and a filing cabinet full of pictures and cards made over the years by my children had been completely submerged. Floors and surfaces were thick with stinking, greasy sludge. I unzipped a portfolio containing my art coursework and filthy water poured out. </p> <p>Clearing out the houses became a daily chore. The army and fire brigade helped carry the heaviest items, which were thrown into trucks. Everyone was moved into caravans on a nearby farmer's field, where we remained for months as our houses were gutted and rebuilt.</p> <p>At first it was like being on holiday. My grandchildren would come and visit, and there was a genuine community spirit. With 50 families sharing four washing machines, some of us took to doing our laundry in the early hours, and I bonded with neighbours I'd previously been only on nodding terms with.</p> <p>As winter loomed, my positivity faltered. The contents of my house had not been insured, and I was consumed by gnawing anxiety. How would I replace what I'd lost?</p> <p>Unable to sleep one night, I took a walk to clear my head and ended up staring into the river from Doncaster North bridge. I'd failed my children and, unable to imagine a positive resolution, decided suddenly that they'd receive the help they needed only without me. I remember a car pulling up and a man asking if I was OK. By the time the police arrived two minutes later, I already had one foot on the railings.</p> <p>With the local hospital full, I spent the night in a police cell, where an officer talked me into a healthier state of mind. Following a psychiatric assessment the next day, I was allowed to return to the caravan.</p> <p>There were dark moments during the next few months, but the stress never overwhelmed me as it had that night. Sometimes, I'd slip away to sleep in my own bed at home. The house smelled terrible, and mould crept up the walls, but it offered respite when I needed it.</p> <p>Almost a year after the flood, we were finally able to move back in. Thanks to Salvation Army funds and gifts from friends, we have a cooker, carpets and basic furnishings. I was allowed to repeat the last year of my degree, and recently passed.</p> <p>The shared experience has strengthened community ties, and we'll talk about this for years to come. Some of the kids still get upset when it rains, though. I know how they feel.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Do you have an experience to share? Email: <a href=\"mailto: experience@theguardian.com\">experience@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>There have been plenty of plays and shows that have attempted to portray the experience of being a refugee in the unwelcoming UK, but one of the first and still the best is Kay Adshead's angry and passionate story about the experiences of one African woman arriving on these inhospitable shores. Desperate to gain asylum after writing an article critical of the regime which leaves family members murdered, she gains entry into the country as a tourist. The piece charts in graphic detail her journey through a system that lacks compassion and which sees her not as a human being but as a problem that must be solved, preferably by sending her back from where she came like an unwanted parcel. You may think that this is a story that you already know well, but Adshead tells it with such spare poetry and blistering anger that it is well worth hearing again. <br></p>",
  "<p>Hurrah, it's Friday! Which means it's time for Davina to dip into her demented wardrobe, pull some random gurny faces and then kick someone out of the House of Charmless Horrors.</p> <p>I'll be liveblogging the Friday eviction show here from <strong>9-10pm</strong> on <strong>Channel 4</strong>, then <strong>back at 10.30</strong> for Davina's interview. Feel free to leave your comments below, and don't forget to click refresh for updates. Oh, and if you're just stopping by to express your withering disdain for our enjoyment of this show, can you not bother? It's just a bit of fun, and I'm sure you have better things to do, no? Ta. </p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/08/big_brother_9_the_eighth_evict.html\">Last week</a>, handsome fanny-nailer (ugh) <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/housemates/profile.jsp?housemateId=234\">Dale</a> got evicted over six-packed <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/housemates/profile.jsp?housemateId=470\">Stuart</a>, and was met in the studio by previous evictee Jen, who was no doubt clutching a 'we're worth more as a couple' magazine deal (cynical? me?). This week Stuart is back up for eviction against pretty Welsh girl <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/bigbrother/housemates/profile.jsp?housemateId=258\">Rachel</a>, which rather suggests that the remaining housemates have some kind of unspoken pact to remove all the good-looking people. Look, I don't know how to break this to you, but you're running out of options, frankly.</p> <p>So, what's been going on this week? Well, apart from performing their interpretation of <em>Die Fledermaus</em> and being attacked by winged monkeys (both of which I just made up, sorry), our tedious ten have been doing Olympian tasks (any excuse to put Stuart in Lycra) and extreme head shaving. There has also been cider stealing by Mo, more weird flirting between Sara and Darnell (gag) and much couply tension between Repellent Rex and his trashy girlfriend Nicole. Who full-on snogged Sara in the ashtray, ticking off the lipstick lesbian box on my Big Brother Clich\u00e9 Bingo card. Yawn.</p> <p>But back to Dale &amp; Jen (Den? Jale?) for a moment - whilst queuing in WHSmith for my lunchtime sandwich today (the lengths I go to to avoid being papped, seriously), I spotted no less than FIVE trash-mag Dale/Jen-related 'exclusives', including the mind-boggling <a href=\"http://www.ok.co.uk/magazine/\">'Our First Night Together' OK! cover story</a>. Has anyone read it? Was OK! actually IN the room? Is it quite literally a blow-by-blow account? Fair me put me off my tuna and cucumber, I tell you.</p> <p>Back at 9!</p> <p><strong>21:00:</strong> And....we're off. Davina is wearing a deeply inoffensive black dress, by the looks of it. What, no boiler suit/camel hoof combo? I am almost disappointed. Unflattering length though, and a highly dodgy alice band.</p> <p>Yesterday's update - most of the housemates are in the bedroom doing the shopping list. Lisa wants every possible variation on a cotton wool theme - pads, buds, the lot. Darnell and Mo are talking about Rex and Nicole - Darnell doesn't like Nicole, and thinks she will take Rex's shine away. Whatever that means.</p> <p>OH MY EYES!! Rex is wearing a green mankini Borat-style in the bathroom - he calls Nicole in to have a look and she is not amused. What must it be like to be entirely void of personality? FFS.</p> <p>Rachel is being profound and caring, and telling Mo not to change. He is not a bad person, she says, and doesn't deserve to be hated. He is a big part of this house, and people care about him, she says, like he is five. Mo doesn't care, and tells her so. Save your breath, love.</p> <p>In the garden, Sara admits that she would like to kiss Stuart? with her deeply irritating Aussie inflection. Mo repeats this through his loudhailer, adding on that she'd actually like 'to fuck him'. Nice.</p> <p>Ad break! Can I liveblog 'The Perfect Vagina' please? Looks like telly gold.</p> <p><strong>21:15:</strong> Davina is gurning and wittering on endlessly. Make it stop, please.</p> <p>Kathreya is wallowing in the bathtub and singing a slightly creepy song about 'Mr Swan'. I feel a hit coming on. Darnell is in the diary room; nominating Nicole has being weighing on his mind, because Rex is his mate and he thinks Rex might not like him any more if he knows Darnell nominated his girlfriend. It's an important question, which I think should be discussed at the highest level. Let's call Kofi Annan in.</p> <p>In the garden, Lisa is being attacked by killer bees. OK, she's not (more's the pity), but she is clearly an expert on this matter, having researched the potency of bee stings. Some wasp poison is equivalent to the rattlesnake, she says, or possibly a cobra. Please bear in mind that this is grown woman, rather than, say, a small child living in la-la land.</p> <p>Rex is discussing whether Nicole should be 'allowed' to wear high heels, as they make her too tall next to his diminutive form. Could he BE any more controlling? What a dick.</p> <p>There is some kind of squawky argument going on about whether you can or can't nominate people you do or don't like. I have stopped listening, and just realised what Lisa wants the cotton wool buds for. For sticking in her ears, and poking Rex in the eye.</p> <p>Ad break!</p> <p><strong>21:30:</strong> We're back! Rex and Nicole are in the bed, looking at his ring, which isn't nearly as interesting as it sounds. Kathreya and Mo are called to the diary room, and sent to jail for discussing nominations. Tsk.</p> <p>In the lounge, Lisa is saying that the house feels like home, and she has 'forgotten she's on a TV show'. Yes, but you think that BEES are as poisonous as rattlesnakes, so you're clearly talking out of your ginormous arse.</p> <p>Mo is in jail, and Vile Rex and his blonde personality vacuum have threatened to steal his cider when the shopping arrives. Mo has a crazed look in his eyes, like a man in jail with no cider. Rex is lying on the floor babbling on about how he is determined to take back the beer Mo took last night, and I have never more wanted to tread on someone's face.</p> <p>Is anyone really missing Brian and Samanda from last year? Yeah, me too.</p> <p>Beer, arguing, you don't fucking owe me fuck all blah blah whatever.</p> <p>Ad break! How DARE Nokia butcher Debussy in such a disgraceful fashion. I am appalled.</p> <p><strong>21:45:</strong> Mo is wearing a deeply disturbing gimp mask in prison. In the lounge, Lisa appears to have applied her lipliner in the dark. With a magic marker, whilst wearing oven gloves. Stuart is wearing a Dexys Midnight Runners neckerchief directly imported from 1983, and looks like a bloke I once snogged down the fairground.</p> <p>Rex takes Mo his cider in jail, who says thank you in a slightly humble fashion. Rex goes back in and tells everyone Mo didn't say thank you, because Rex is a TOTAL COCK. Ahem.</p> <p>Nicole sticks her nose in where it isn't wanted, asking Mikey why he's holding cookies (not a euphemism, blessedly) and Mikey goes off on one about her endless criticising, asking Rex if he agrees that his girlfriend is a giant pain in the ass. She has a very annoying voice, and I'm thinking Rex probably deserves her.</p> <p>Bohemian Rhapsody is being played into the house, and is systematically slaughtered by every housemate. Mamma Mia let me go.</p> <p>Rex and Nicole are in bed, and he is touching her head in a sinister fashion and demanding information about the outside world. She is not giving it up, clearly, and he is not happy that his girlfriend is not obeying his every command. Is anyone else reminded of the creepy guy from Sleeping With The Enemy?</p> <p>The lines are closed, the votes have been verified etc, and it's <strong>STUART!</strong></p> <p>There is crying. And hugging. He seems genuinely quite excited to be going. A centrespread in Men's Health calls. Oh, and his daughter, obv.</p> <p>Back at 10.35 for endless shots of Stuart's six pack! Hurrah! And Davina' perving, despite being old enough to be his mum (probably).</p> <p><strong>22:35:</strong> We're back! BACK! Davina looks somewhat excited at the prospect of being in close proximity to Stuart.</p> <p>We see the announcement again, and all the crying and hugging. Rex announces that he is 'disappointed' at the result, in front of Rachel. Nice.</p> <p>Stuart leaves, and I've just realised that the copious amounts of eyemakeup are merely there to detract from the fact that he's thinning on top. There is much cheering, and Stuart is dragged into the crowd by baying women off their heads on WKD (probably). Davina starts flapping, but the security men drag him out. The cheering turns to screaming. I believe Stuart may be popular with the ladies.</p> <p>Ad break! I want to know more about trimming one's labia, don't you?</p> <p>Stuart is safe in the studio, far from the feral crowd. He's got what he wanted, says Davina - he's been talking about leaving for weeks. Well why didn't you LEAVE, then? He's gone for the nail varnish as well as full eyemakeup, but doesn't have the hands for it, frankly. And also some kind of tie/scarf/noose thing. It's all a bit Rocky Horror. Frankly, he looks a bloody mess.</p> <p>We see who nominated him - Kathreya, Nicole, Darnell, Mo and Rex.</p> <p>Davina thinks he's lovely, and he gives her a kiss on the cheek. Down, girl.</p> <p>We see many, many shots of Stuart's over-buffed physique, and it's all deeply homoerotic - even my Other Half grudging concedes that he has an amazing body (a weird moment for me, frankly). Stuart is cringing, and says he hates it. Hmm, yet still he lifts weights in the pool, wearing speedos.</p> <p>Stuart talks about the other housemates, and comes over as being really quite cheeky and likeable, albeit a bit naive. He tries to be self-deprecating, but as Vina points out, he is clearly fishing for compliments, so perhaps not so naive. He wants Mikey to win, because he's the only one in the house who isn't acting, apparently.</p> <p>We see his best bits, which mainly involve him flirting with girls, having a laugh, getting stuck into the tasks, moaning about how much he misses his daughter and getting his body out.</p> <p>Can someone please explain to me how this guy is out, whilst Rex is still in? I am at a loss.</p> <p>And that's it! All over for another week. Not sure who's in the hot seat next week, but rest assured someone will be here. Thanks as ever for all your hilarious comments, and have a top weekend. Night! Hx.</p>",
  "<p>A group of detainees at an Oxfordshire immigration centre are on hunger strike and have pledged to continue refusing food \"until their very last breaths\" in protest against the forced deportation of asylum seekers. </p> <p>Thirteen Iraqi Kurds held at the Campsfield House site near Kidlington began refusing meals last Saturday after being told they would soon be sent back to Iraq and hearing reports that an Iraqi man had killed himself after being deported from the UK. </p> <p>A number of other detainees joined in the protest and it was thought more than 60 inmates, of many nationalities, were also refusing food during the past week.</p> <p>One of the hunger strikers, Fazzel Abdul, an Iraqi who has been in Britain for seven years, said they were now feeling very weak after seven days without food and only a little water. </p> <p>\"Without any reason we are being held here and they are trying to deport us to the most dangerous country in the world,\" he said. \"We want people to listen to us \u2013 we want a promise to be treated as human beings.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/15/advertising.marketingandpr\">Stella Artois and ad agency Lowe have bid adieu after 26 years</a>, bringing an end to one of the most famous relationships in UK advertising history.</p> <p>Stella's famous \"Reassuringly expensive\" ads have charmed TV audiences but in recent years have made for a tricky juxtaposition as the brewer has struggled against a street-level view of its premium brand as \"wife beater\".</p> <p>Sir Frank Lowe, the eponymous founder of the agency who left in 2005, hit brand gold with his founding client when he launched the \"Reassuringly expensive\" positioning in the early 1980s.</p> <p>There is no question of the pedigree of the ads, which are mostly French-themed, cinematic, often shot in black and white and always epic.</p> <p>The first of the famous ads featured \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYVq8M7ybs\">Jacques\" the flower seller</a> in the in the Jean de Florette-inspired series of commercials.</p> <p>A string of often award-winning ads followed over the years including <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msFh08ZsE48\">\"Returning Hero\"</a>, which saw a bar owner cunningly stand on a beer hose to save giving \"precious\" Stella to two war veterans; and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01mG3RDdf28\">\"Pilot\"</a> featuring a bartender giving up a downed pilot to the Germans.</p> <p>There was also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esgT1dpGOZo\">\"Last Wishes\"</a>, the one with the man who gets a pint of Stella for a man on his deathbed after the villagers have had a whipround. On the way back from the bar, he drinks the pint but convinces the villagers that the priest has drunk the beer by tking the cleric's coat and passing him the empty pint glass.</p> <p>Hellboy actor Ron Perlman made an appearance in 2003's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OKw3_XTvro\">\"Devil's Island\"</a> and Jonathan Glazer's witty <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq0pdtEtrig\">\"Ice Skating Priests\"</a> have appeared in more recent TV campaigns.</p> <p>The ads draw on images from another place and time, of quality and reserve. Gentleness even.</p> <p>Problem is, back in the real world Stella Artois has found itself on increasingly tricky ground as health campaigners have targeted the brand for its alleged role in binge drinking culture.</p> <p>Stella Artois this year pulled its sponsorship of the pre-Wimbledon tennis tournament at Queen's Club, which Lowe created as a marketing vehicle 30 years ago. Some argue this was because of the increasingly contentious issue of linking the brand with sport.</p> <p>The writing was on the wall for Lowe when Stella's parent company InBev, which has rattled the marketing department changes since the merger of Interbrew and Ambev in 2004, handed part of the brand's ad account to rival agency Mother - a hot front runner to take the whole business, surely.</p> <p>Still, the account defined Lowe and its loss, which comes after a string of managerial shakeups in recent years, will undoubtedly sting the agency and its ambitions as a global network.</p> <p>Stella spends around \u00a313.5m a year on above-the-line advertising in the UK alone, according to Nielsen Media Research.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest question as Stella charts new horizons is what creative approach the brand needs to take to tackle its \"wife beater\" image.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you for the huge number of very varied poems submitted in response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/01/poetryworkshop.poetry\">this month's exercise</a>. Reading through them has been a moving experience. </p> <p>I've never actually used Leonard Cohen in a workshop before, but I have suggested many variations of the \"dead letter\", when the poet writes to a person lost, and it never fails to garner a strong response \u2013 perhaps because conjuring up the dead is one of the basic, magic, functions of poetry. Like any s\u00e9ance, a poem of this sort works best if you can bring in a few items belonging to the lost person - here, Dave Finchett very successfully uses tobacco and sweeties to conjure a person I take to be his father: </p> <p><strong>Tar On Your Fingers by Dave Finchett</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><br>I'm sat in my office, </p> <p>the clock says it's midnight. </p> <p>There's a breeze on my shoulders, </p> <p>the blinds are bent out of shape.</p> <p>I'm writing to you to keep us </p> <p>connected.</p> <p>When I think of you now I </p> <p>picture a soldier</p> <p>who sailed from Tilbury </p> <p>in June '44.</p> <p>Who saw a beach </p> <p>of bodies, </p> <p>heard the booms of the Warspite.</p> <p>Who dodged bullets and shells </p> <p>in Luc-sur-Mer.</p> <p>Then there's the father</p> <p>who went alone to the football,</p> <p>played bingo on Saturdays,</p> <p>slept by the TV </p> <p>in a leather armchair.</p> <p>Do you still wear a cap? </p> <p>That threadbare old jacket? </p> <p>Can I have a chocolate \u00e9clair sweet </p> <p>from the paper bag </p> <p>in your pocket?</p> <p>Perhaps you'll look younger</p> <p>without the weight of the years,</p> <p>but there'll still be tar on your fingers.</p> <p>The smoking ban is a bandwagon, </p> <p>you'll say. </p> <p>Opinions of yours </p> <p>hang like banners </p> <p>from the queue in the butchers</p> <p>to the gatherings of the family. </p> <p>Needless to say that's nothing new.</p> <p>I still miss you.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>That poem slightly looses momentum in the final stanzas, which could perhaps be cut back.</p> <p>Another advantage of the dead letter poem is its direct address, which allows the reader immediate access to another world and relationship. Swar Thounaojum's poem has a truly startling opening, and uses concrete detail and local language superbly throughout the poem, wavering only in the third stanza. The poem digs down steadily through actual earth to make us experience an actual grief. </p> <p><strong>A sentry converses by Swar Thounaojam</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Ibungo, how is your urn?<br>Does it still hold you?</p> <p>First they put a garage over you<br>Then a plot of chives and shallots<br>Now it is a tea stall<br>and underneath the bench, on which I sweat sipping my tea,<br>is you - 14 months old and gone for 12 years. </p> <p>Your mother cried she gave you the greater love.<br>So good you and your brother<br>were such unthinking children <br>and that you died.<br>Loud, unlike love is such drivel to grow up with. </p> <p>You were too young to know you had a big head.<br>So let me tell you - you had a gigantic head<br>and never cried.<br>First, people said you were a good-natured child.<br>Then you became too odd - a never-crying child.<br>You were shown to doctors, who showed <br>you were wrong somewhere.<br>They were about to fix you properly<br>When you just left. </p> <p>I think of you often,<br>wishing you were my real brother:<br>I could have claimed your death as my valid sorrow <br>and rig people to explain<br>my unsound quiet with it.</p> <p>Now I will beat my heels,<br>right where the spade struck first to bury you.<br>There, can you hear it? </p> <p>Ibungo, you never grew up to know me. <br>But remember this is your Che, your big sister,<br>Guarding your life.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sarah James' poem also addresses a lost baby, and again through the metaphor of digging down, though this time through clothes in a cupboard. The soft, never worn-bootee is a fine metaphor for an emptied womb \u2013 I think the poet should cut out only the apologies in the second and sixth stanzas. There is nothing to apologise for in this carefully wrought piece, and it would be a more powerful and dramatic poem without them. </p> <p><strong>Bagging Up by Sarah James </strong></p> <blockquote> <p>I found it this morning: a single pink bootee<br>gaping white like an empty shell.</p> <p>Of course, I ought not to tell you,<br>ought not to picture you <br>when I see flowers, bonnets and frilly dresses<br>next to the boys' dungarees.</p> <p>You should be grown tall by now.<br>But I can still hold you: fossilised<br>fragments from the scan cupped<br>in my hand; small as a bullet,</p> <p>or hole in the heart.<br>I imagine dark curls, shy smile,<br>though when you speak,<br>it's merely an echo of their toddler talk.</p> <p>I write this to you, my child <br>that never was, yet is.<br> But<br>I write it for me,</p> <p>though words won't bend to explain<br>longing for you, I love the boys no less.<br>And yes, I know I am lucky,<br>lucky to have children at all.</p> <p>But as I fold away bibs and bodysuits,<br>and bag up blue for my friends,<br>the pink of your bootee creases my thoughts.<br>I ought to throw it out, finish my letter, say goodbye...</p> <p>Instead, I reach up, hide it high <br>in a cupboard my boys must never find.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cohen's song evokes particularly powerfully the post-adolescent years: fancy dress, addictions, shifting self-images, theatrical, miserable relationships. Sarah Westcott's poem is also immersed in this world, as it evokes the last days of a University drop-out. This is a fully formed, beautifully crafted poem \u2013 the pick of the bunch for me- which successfully floats free of the exercise. I particularly admire the way the last three stanzas is elegantly punctuated with assonances \u2013 shower, lecture, care, air, meteor, hair- liekte the lingering smoke they are describing. </p> <p><strong>Drop Out by Sarah Westcott</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>I knew you had to go<br>when you stayed in your pyjamas all day,<br>the fug of dope settling like rain on a campsite,<br>mist over the sea.</p> <p>You were sluggish, your neurones<br>stilled in the smoke. You didn't bother<br>with make-up or revision.<br>You learned to stick the skins together, roll</p> <p>the bolus of baccy in its little grave<br>then sprinkle in the ganga<br>tarry and sticky as a fudge brownie.<br>You'd twist the end like a Christmas cracker,</p> <p>inhale and wince as the heat<br>fingered coral tunnels of lung,<br>lie on the landlord's sofa<br>all dumbed-out; the orange tip arcing</p> <p>from waist to lip, showering meteors<br>into his carpet, burning holes.<br>I knew you had to go<br>when you missed all your lectures</p> <p>and didn't care. If I moved the curtains,<br>you were wreathed in the air.</p> <p>Sometimes I can still smell you in my hair.</p> </blockquote> <p>Chris Lilly is writing about the same period, though here from a greater distance of years. The language is less nuanced and crafted than Westcott's, but the poem is sustained by a good plot and strong punchline . These may not qualities we necessarily associate with a successful poem, but, as I often find myself saying in poetry workshops- unless something happens in a poem, why would we keep reading it?</p> <p><strong><br>BROKEN NEWS by Chris Lilly</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>His dying featured on the news;<br>I thought of you. Him too, of course,<br>But he was less to me, while you<br>Were once my friend.</p> <p>\"How will she cope? That vague, that<br>Slightly ditzy, dreamy, lovely<br>Girl I shared a house with; how<br>When paying bills and turning on</p> <p>Hot water heaters baffled you.<br>But then, that was a while ago.<br>Hot summer, plagues of ladybirds<br>And squads of West Indian quicks</p> <p>Destroying England. Finals, and <br>Revising in the garden, you in long<br>Cotton smocks and sunhats, me<br>In jeans and tee-shirts, much as now.</p> <p>You taught me how to say; \"I<br>Love you\" in Mandarin.

Of course<br>You'll manage, grief and loss</p> <p>Is something we grow into, and <br>You've grown. My heart to you,<br>And just to let you know,<br>Wo ay nee.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rebecca Goss's poem also returns us, painfully, to our youth, with a piercing poem on adolescence and loss. I like the metaphysical twist Goss has taken on the exercise, as well has her all-too real use of detail \u2013 especially the clothes-horse. </p> <p><strong>Virginity by Rebecca Goss</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><br>Lost in a cramped flat, gas fire on, </p> <p>Echo and the Bunnymen on low, </p> <p>I want you back. Taken on the floor,</p> <p>in five quick stabs, you're someone else's. </p> <p>It was lonely in the bathroom without you, </p> <p>where a week of bleeding started, splashed</p> <p>on to school socks. A clothes horse straddled </p> <p>the bath, his wife's bras, knickers dripped. </p> <p>Gone in minutes, my yoke of fifteen years, </p> <p>discovered at a disco, his fingers tugging </p> <p>at you in the outside dark. Come back, </p> <p>for a wedding, for the making of a life. </p> <p>This time, leave me trembling, absolved.</p> </blockquote> <p>Richard O'Brien's poem is partly a tribute to Cohen, partly a riff, partly a satire. It treads, in fact the same precarious line as Cohen's own song, between irony and passion, self-romance and self-disgust.

  "<p>None of us were around when the Titanic sank but it seems safe to assume the incident wasn't given anything like the Scottish newspaper coverage as Carlos Cu\u00e9llar's departure from Rangers this week.</p> <p>That's right, Rangers sold a player. For \u00a37.8m. Nobody is dead, no war has started, yet words such as \"tragedy\" and \"betrayal\" have been commonplace. It would make you laugh, if it wasn't so utterly ridiculous.</p> <p>Rangers' supporters may yet opt to protest outside Ibrox before tomorrow's match with Hearts while others have pinged their season tickets back for an instant refund. They are upset, furious in fact, that their once-proud club dare sell another player to England's Premier League and make a \u00a36m profit in the process. After Alan Hutton's \u00a39m move to Tottenham, Cu\u00e9llar's exit to Aston Villa has proved too much to stomach. Rangers cannot be a selling club, fans argue, and Sir David Murray's stewardship is riddled with lies and empty promises.</p> <p>Time to wake up and smell the coffee, folks. Rangers, and Celtic for that matter, are feeder clubs where the major leagues of Europe, namely England and Spain, are concerned. Transfers such as those of Hutton and Cu\u00e9llar generate more than six times what domestic television revenues mean in monetary terms. Make no mistake, if a side from south of the border launches a \u00a310m bid to prize Aiden McGeady from Parkhead, the odds are strongly in favour of him being offski as well.</p> <p>The great irony of the Cu\u00e9llar \"tragedy\" will not be lost on followers of non-Old Firm clubs. For years Rangers and Celtic have pilfered the best talent from elsewhere in Scotland, often for below market value, and thought nothing of it. Now? Punters cry foul when the big boys from across the border wade in and hand pick footballers from Glasgow. Far from rocket science, it is basic economics; Rangers could not and would not refuse the Cu\u00e9llar cash, especially given their embarrassing exit from Europe. Murray has actually stuck his neck out somewhat in promising to reinvest it in the team.</p> <p>Football fans remain a fickle bunch. The Rangers players, who performed so poorly amid defeat to FBK Kaunas last midweek, have been largely spared criticism. Murray, as well as the chief executive Martin Bain and the manager Walter Smith, meanwhile, are accused of bringing the club to its knees. Murray, it is widely known, would sell his stake in the club if any genuine bidder was forthcoming \u2013 an unlikely prospect given the revenue restrictions of the SPL. Bain made his company a healthy profit on Cu\u00e9llar and even took the unnecessary step of phoning supporters' representatives to explain the situation. Smith, meanwhile, is left to work with a group of players who are apparently still in holiday mode. There was no wailing and gnashing from the stands over the way their beloved Rangers were being run as progress was made to last season's Uefa Cup final.</p> <p>It is natural that supporters are upset if good players leave their club. Yet talk of tragedies and protest shows them to be out of touch with reality; the truth is that Scottish clubs are and will remain subordinate to leagues such as England. It is actually a backhanded compliment to the rising standard of the SPL that players such as Cu\u00e9llar, Hutton and Craig Gordon can command such lavish transfer fees. Even five years ago, after all, English scouts would hardly dare to travel north of Newcastle.</p> <p>As for Cu\u00e9llar himself, those launching into indignant rants regarding the motives for his move should, as always, ask what they would do if another employer offered them a higher profile, an opportunity to better themselves and, crucially, four times their salary. Despite his assertions that he loved life in Scotland, it is safe to assume it was not Cu\u00e9llar's lifelong ambition to play for Glasgow Rangers. Managers, after all, value players who want to test their ability against the best possible opposition. Suffice to say, that means Manchester United rather than Motherwell.</p> <p>The scent of protest will be in the air tomorrow, unless Rangers rattle a couple of early goals past Hearts. Even if they do not, chaps, it really is time to indulge in a small helping of reality.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's Ben Ainslie and the new Yngling blondes - Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb, and Pippa Wilson - maintained their gold medal position after the penultimate day's sailing here in Fushan Bay. All that remains is Saturday's last medal race when the points count double, and both Ainslie, on the verge of his third Olympic gold, and Pippa Wilson exuded quiet confidence born of a series of outstanding races here.</p> <p>So Ainslie, the most formidable dinghy racer of his generation, and perhaps any other generation, is poised to become Britain's most celebrated Olympic sailor, a position previously held by by Rodney Pattison who won two gold and a silver in the Flying Dutchman class at the Mexico, Munich, and Montreal Olympics. Ainslie currently has two golds and a silver.</p> <p>His only rival in the final race is the American Zach Railey whom Ainslie will be watching like a hawk. In the last but one race Ainslie finished second, while Railey, towards the back of the fleet, simply made sure he stayed ahead of the Frenchman Guillaume Florent to preserve his silver medal position. \" I still have a shot at the gold,\" said Railey, but nobody much believed him. Ainslie is a tactical genius, and will weigh up every option down to the very last puff of wind. \"Ben is one of the best dinghy sailors ever,\" admitted the American.</p> <p>Ainslie, understandably, was not prepared to conced that the gold medal was there for him on a plate. \"The job is only half done. You can never have enough points for the lead, and I'm hoping for a good breeze. I will stick to Zach like glue, and I don't have to worry about a third sailor.\"</p> <p>Essentially Ainslie could sail a tactically defensive race, simply making sure that not too many boats get between him and the American and such is the British sailors tactical acumen that nobody seems to doubt that he will. Conversely nobody would be the least surprised if he sailed away into the far blue yonder.</p> <p>\"You try and get out in front, but it's all about doing everything well. The match racing I have had before in the America's Cup will help, but these medal races can quite often kick up something up,\" said Ainslie, who is never averse to putting the boot in if necessary. \"The pressure is certainly not off, I wish it was. I just have to keep my head screwed on.\" Few doubt that this, the most brilliant of sailing heads when it comes to dinghy sailing, will be fixed on tighter than tight.</p> <p>The fact that Railey, who has sailed out of his skin here, chose to defend his silver medal position, on another day of shifting winds and cancelled races, seemed to point to the fact that he had really all but given up on any chances of striking gold, although Ainslie would be the last to take anything for granted.</p> <p>Britain, with Shirley Robertson at the helm, won the inaugural Yngling gold in Athens, and this time Sarah Ayton is poised to repeat the golden moment, this time at the tiller herself. In their penultimate race the three women sailors finished fifth, and the race for gold, given that they start and finish cleanly, will be between them and the Dutch trio who won Friday's race. \"We had always prepared for a close final race, but it's going to be tough,\" said Pippa Wilson, who has joined the boat since Athens. \"I'm very lucky to be sailing with them, and we all see things the same way. It's always been about coming home with the gold.\"</p> <p>She admitted that they had made a wrong selection on sail size on Friday, with the wind not as strong as they had expected. \"But we hung in. Obviously we will all have a few butterflies in the final race, but we know we have to beat the Dutch.\"</p>",
  "<p>Stella Artois and ad agency Lowe have parted company after 26 years, bringing to an end one of adland's most enduring and creatively-lauded relationships.</p> <p>The decision, which affects the Lowe Worldwide network, ends a relationship begun by Sir Frank Lowe when he started the agency in the 1980s.</p> <p>Stella Artois is famous for its \"Reassuringly expensive\" strapline and Lowe developed a reputation for stylish, cinematic ads for the beer, notably in the style of Jean de Florette.</p> <p>The beer brand's parent company InBev, which recently handed the advertising business for the launch of its new 4% Stella Artois variant to rival agency Mother, is understood to be set to hold a pitch to handle the business.</p> <p>Lowe, which runs the Stella business from its London headquarters, will not be taking part in the pitch.</p> <p>This year also marked the close of Stella Artois's 30-year relationship with the eponymous tennis tournament at the Queen's Club, a prelude to Wimbledon.</p> <p>Lowe came up with the idea for the sponsorship, but in recent years the Stella brand name has been dropped from the association.</p> <p>Some have argued the decision to drop Stella from the Queen's Club sponsorship was linked to the brand being linked by some with the worst excesses of binge drinking culture, with the company instead promoting the \"Artois family\" of beers.</p> <p>Lowe still retains the global advertising account for InBev's Becks beer brand.</p> <p>Despite Stella acquiring an unsavoury reputation in recent years for fuelling the UK's binge drinking culture, Lowe has maintained its premium brand image by drawing on the continental roots of the beer.</p> <p>Before the advent of the famous Stella TV ads, Lowe produced highly applauded print work for the brand - such as the \"My shout, he whispered\" campaign - in the early 1980s that became the vehicle for the \"Reassuringly expensive\" positioning that was to follow.</p> <p>The early 1990s saw the debut of the first in a string of famous TV ads featuring the flower seller <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYVq8M7ybs\">\"Jacques\"</a> in the Jean de Florette-inspired series of commercials.</p> <p>A string of epic TV ads followed over the next 15 years, often using black and white footage with a number set during the first world war in France.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msFh08ZsE48\">\"Returning hero\"</a> in 2001 saw a bar owner cunningly squash a beer hose so he did not have to give two war heroes the pints of Stella they so crave.</p> <p>And in 2004 the brand returned to war with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01mG3RDdf28\">\"Pilot\"</a>, which saw a bar tender giving up a downed fighter pilot who was hiding in his establishment to German soldiers in order to keep his Stella stock safe.</p> <p>Hell boy actor Ron Pearlman starred in the 2003 epic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OKw3_XTvro\">\"Devil's Island\"</a>, one of the most expensive ads ever made, while ice skating priests in 2005 was one of the most recent epic ads.</p> <p>However, the Stella brand has struggled in recent years to maintain its premium positioning.</p> <p>A chunk of its ad spend has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/21/advertising.marketingandpr\">transferred online</a>, which is where a number cinematic ads have been created, although not all of them have made it to TV and cinema.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Much of the global warming debate is perhaps best described as a constant outbidding by frantic campaigners, producing a barrage of ever-more scary scenarios in an attempt to get the public to accept their civilisation-changing proposals. Unfortunately, the general public \u2013 while concerned about the environment \u2013 is distinctly unwilling to support questionable solutions with costs running into tens of trillions of pounds. Predictably, this makes the campaigners reach for even more outlandish scares.</p> <p>These alarmist predictions are becoming quite bizarre, and could be dismissed as sociological oddities, if it weren't for the fact that they get such big play in the media. Oliver Tickell, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange\">writes that</a> a global warming causing a 4C temperature increase by the end of the century would be a \"catastrophe\" and the beginning of the \"extinction\" of the human race. This is simply silly.</p> <p>His evidence? That 4C would mean that all the ice on the planet would melt, bringing the long-term sea level rise to 70-80m, flooding everything we hold dear, seeing billions of people die. Clearly, Tickell has maxed out the campaigners' scare potential (because there is no more ice to melt, this is the scariest he could ever conjure). But he is wrong. Let us just remember that the UN climate panel, the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/index.htm\">IPCC</a>, expects a temperature rise by the end of the century between 1.8 and 6.0C. Within this range, the IPCC predicts that, by the end of the century, sea levels will rise 18-59 <em>centimetres</em> \u2013 Tickell is simply exaggerating by a factor of up to <em>400</em>.</p> <p>Tickell will undoubtedly claim that he was talking about what <em>could</em> happen many, many millennia from now. But this is disingenuous. First, the 4C temperature rise is predicted on a century scale \u2013 this is what we talk about and can plan for. Second, although sea-level rise will continue for many centuries to come, the models unanimously show that Greenland's ice shelf will be reduced, but Antarctic ice will increase even more (because of increased precipitation in Antarctica) for the next three centuries. What will happen beyond that clearly depends much more on emissions in future centuries. Given that CO2 stays in the atmosphere about a century, what happens with the temperature, say, six centuries from now mainly depends on emissions five centuries from now (where it seems unlikely non-carbon emitting technology such as solar panels will not have become economically competitive). </p> <p>Third, Tickell tells us how the 80m sea-level rise would wipe out all the world's coastal infrastructure and much of the world's farmland \u2013 \"undoubtedly\" causing billions to die. But to cause billions to die, it would require the surge to occur within a single human lifespan. This sort of scare tactic is insidiously wrong and misleading, mimicking a firebrand preacher who claims the earth is coming to an end and we need to repent. While it is probably true that the sun will burn up the earth in 4-5bn years' time, it does give a slightly different perspective on the need for immediate repenting. </p> <p>Tickell's claim that 4C will be the beginning of our extinction is again many times beyond wrong and misleading, and, of course, made with no data to back it up. Let us just take a look at the realistic impact of such a 4C temperature rise. For the <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Default.aspx?ID=788\">Copenhagen Consensus</a>, one of the lead economists of the IPCC, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Yohe\">Professor Gary Yohe</a>, did a survey of all the problems and all the benefits accruing from a temperature rise over this century of about approximately 4C. And yes, there will, of course, also be benefits: as temperatures rise, more people will die from heat, but fewer from cold; agricultural yields will decline in the tropics, but increase in the temperate zones, etc.</p> <p>The model evaluates the impacts on agriculture, forestry, energy, water, unmanaged ecosystems, coastal zones, heat and cold deaths and disease. The bottom line is that benefits from global warming right now <em>outweigh</em> the costs (the benefit is about 0.25% of global GDP). Global warming will continue to be a net benefit until about 2070, when the damages will begin to outweigh the benefits, reaching a total damage cost equivalent to about 3.5% of GDP by 2300. This is simply not the end of humanity. If anything, global warming is a net benefit now; and even in three centuries, it will not be a challenge to our civilisation. Further, the IPCC expects the average person on earth to be 1,700% richer by the end of this century.</p> <p>Tickell's hellfire and damnation sermon also misinforms us of the solutions to global warming: panicking is rarely the right state of mind for finding smart solutions. In essence, Tickell says that because the outlook is so frightening, we need to cut much, much more than the <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php\">Kyoto protocol</a> called for. Now, all peer-reviewed, published economic models demonstrate that such an effort is a colossal waste of money \u2013 one of the leading models shows that, for every pound spent, Tickell's solution would do about 13p-worth of good.</p> <p>Tickell finds that current climate efforts like Kyoto have been \"miserable failures\", which is true, but makes it seem rather odd that he thinks much-more-of-the-same will suddenly be great policy. He claims that the reason these policies are not realised is because our governments are \"craven to special interests\". While this is convenient to believe, it is, of course, incorrect; the real reason is that no one in the electorate wants to pay \u00a32, \u00a33 or even \u00a34 for a litre of petrol. </p> <p>If we are to find a workable and economically smart solution, we would do well to look at the best climate solution from the top economists from the Copenhagen Consensus. They found that, unlike even moderate CO2 cuts, which cost more than they do good, we should focus on investing in finding cheaper low-carbon energy. This requires us to invest massively in energy research and development (R&amp;D). Right now, we don't \u2013 because the climate panic makes us focus exclusively on cutting CO2. </p> <p>R&amp;D has been dropping worldwide since the early 1980s. If we increased this investment ten-fold, it would still be ten times cheaper than Kyoto, and probably hundreds to thousands of times cheaper than Tickell's proposal. The literature indicates that for every pound invested, we would do \u00a311-worth of good. The reason: because when we all talk about cutting CO2, we might get some well-meaning westerners to put up a few inefficient solar panels on their roof-tops. While it costs a lot, it will do little and have no impact on Chinese and Indian emissions. But if we focus on <em>investing</em> in making cheaper solar panels, they will become competitive sooner, making everyone, including the Chinese and Indians, switch. </p> <p>Such a proposal is efficient, politically feasible and will actually fix climate change in the medium term. Being panicked by incorrect data and suggesting outlandish policies might create a splash, but it will stall our prospects of achieving real change.</p> <p>Let's not be silly \u2013 let's choose the best solution.</p>",

  "<p>Basra - boom city? Apparently so, if you believe Major General Barney White-Spunner, the soon-to-depart head of UK forces in southern Iraq.</p> <p>Not only is life becoming considerably freer and safer after militias disappeared from the streets, but the local economy is starting to bounce back, with many shops and restaurants reopening.</p> <p>Reports of buoyant economic confidence have been around for a while. At the end of last month, the British head of a group intended to bring investment into the southern Iraqi city was <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKL154698020080731\">claiming \"significant interest\"</a> from foreign firms.</p> <p>But what about everyday life on the streets? The picture is harder to gauge. Iraq's Alsumeria TV talked last week of <a href=\"http://www.alsumaria.tv/en/Iraq-News/1-21082-Basra-markets-and-businesses-flourishing.html\">\"a new atmosphere\" in Basra</a> with markets and street businesses flourishing amid a renewed influx of people into the streets.</p> <p>Times correspondent <a href=\"http://timesonline.typepad.com/inside_iraq_weblog/2008/08/basra-people-re.html\">Deborah Haynes spoke to a female university student</a> while in Basra earlier this month. Eman Ali, 24, had spent the past few years living in fear of militant Islamist militias. Now things have improved - in part:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is true that things are better in Basra, but until this moment it is not the desired improvement. As a woman I cannot feel safe. Maybe this is because of old fears of what we have endured. </p> </blockquote> <p>Most dramatic of all - if not entirely serious - was a report in the Mirror a few days earlier, which talks up Basra's charms as a <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/02/welcome-to-basra-115875-20680591/\">potential tourist destination</a>. Reporter Kate Jackson enjoys an evening ice cream on a busy street:</p> <blockquote> <p>The air is filled with life and happiness, the road jam-packed with cars and the temperature slowly cooling to a bearable level. It could be a tourist hotspot in Morocco - except I'm surrounded by 10 soldiers, some in the sand-coloured uniform of the British and others in dark green Iraqi gear. And I'm wearing body armour.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is perhaps understandable scepticism on the <a href=\"http://www.arrse.co.uk/cpgn2/Forums.html\">British Army Rumour Service forums</a>. One says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sounds terrific. How do we get there? Last one to the recruiting office is caravanning in Wales.</p> </blockquote> <p>And another:</p> <blockquote> <p>I could about as easily see Kate Jackson with notebook on her tod in NW Basra or around the Shia Flats, about as easily as I could see Gordon Brown surviving until the election as PM.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>What was the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/155500.stm\">Prague Spring</a>, or the events of 1968 more generally? Their meaning, it seems, has become more, not less, debatable with the passage of time. </p> <p>My generation was forged by protests and police truncheons, by the hopes generated not only by the Prague Spring, but also by the <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/globalisation/the_polish_march_students_workers_and_1968\">Polish student movement</a> that March, the Paris events of May, and the first signs of Russian democracy voiced in the early books of Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn. For those of us imprisoned in Poland, the Prague Spring was a harbinger of hope. Even Poland's communist newspapers, read behind bars, somehow conveyed news of the great changes taking place in our neighbour to the south. </p> <p>So I remember my shock when I learned about the Soviet <a href=\"http://www.lib.umich.edu/spec-coll/czech/\">invasion of Czechoslovakia</a> in August, and the trauma that lingered long after. On the 10th anniversary of that invasion, V\u00e1clav Havel, Jacek Kuron, and I, along with other dissidents, met on the Czech-Polish border. There is a photograph of that occasion: future presidents, ministers, and parliamentarians who were at that time pursued by the police like common criminals. </p> <p>These encounters were an extension of the climate of the Prague Spring. We all felt that we were creating something new, something that might, one day, turn out to be an important component of democracy in our countries. </p> <p>And so it was. In August 1989, I proposed in the Polish diet a draft resolution apologising to the Czechs and Slovaks for Polish involvement in the 1968 invasion. I felt that a historical circle was being closed: the ideas of the Polish March and the Prague Spring, the ideas of our mountain meetings, were becoming political facts. Three months later, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution\">Velvet Revolution</a> began in Prague. </p> <p>The main difference between the Prague Spring and the Velvet Revolution was that the former was mostly the work of Communist party members and others who wanted to bring about \"socialism with a human face.\" As a result, some people nowadays dismiss the Prague Spring as a power struggle between communists. But there were many roads to \u2013 and through \u2013 communism, and many of them converged with national traditions. </p> <p>Indeed, communism was attractive for many reasons, including the idea of universal justice and humanised social relations; a response to the great spiritual crisis after the first world war and, later, to the Nazis' genocide; and the conviction that western dominance of the world was nearing its end. Finally, in a world divided by Yalta, communism was, for some, the only realistic choice for central Europe. </p> <p>In Czechoslovakia in 1968, communist reformers appealed to democratic ideals that were deeply rooted in the country's pre-second world war past. Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the Czechoslovak communists and the symbol of the Prague Spring, personified hope for democratic evolution, real pluralism, and a peaceful way to a state governed by law and respectful of human rights. </p> <p>By contrast, in Poland, which had witnessed its own tentative opening in the March student movement, a nationalist-authoritarian faction exploited all that was intolerant and ignorant in Polish tradition, employing xenophobia and anti-intellectual rhetoric. Mieczyslaw Moczar, the Polish interior minister and leader of the nationalist faction, combined communist rhetoric with a language proper to fascist movements in order to mobilise the masses against the \"cosmopolitan-liberal intelligentsia.\" </p> <p>The Polish freedom movement of 1968 lost its confrontation with police violence; the Prague Spring was crushed by the armies of five Warsaw Pact members. But in both countries, 1968 gave birth to a new political consciousness. The Polish and Czech opposition movements that emerged only a few years later had their roots in the events of 1968. </p> <p>Attitudes towards communism were always a controversial subject for the anticommunist opposition. Some rejected communism in all its forms. The majority though, in one way or another, had some contact with communism, through intellectual fascination, participation in state institutions, or the cold conviction that only by accepting the reality of life under communism could one do something useful for one's country. These people, \"tainted by communism\", constituted the majority of the participants in all revolts against the communist dictatorships. </p> <p>There was, however, another category of people: the \"careful and untainted\", who absented themselves from the world of politics. They hated communism, but, convinced that the system could not be reformed, they avoided the democratic opposition. While others took risks or sat in jails, they functioned in official and legal structures. </p> <p>One should not blame anyone today for such behaviour. But it is surprising when these people accuse participants in the Prague Spring and the democratic opposition of links with communism. </p> <p>Communism was obviously an instrument of Soviet domination over conquered societies, but it was also a modus vivendi for large parts of these nations under the conditions in which they were obliged to live. </p> <p>The Prague Spring appealed to elementary values: freedom, pluralism, tolerance, sovereignty, and rejection of the dictates of communist orthodoxy. When I recall these events after 40 years, I see not only revolt, but also the great illusion that it might be possible to outfox the Kremlin and painlessly move society from communism to democracy. This belief was naive, but it also underpinned a national awakening in which the potential for freedom found its voice. </p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008</p>",

  "<p>Britain's unhappy experience at the archery field came to a sour end as Alan Wills, the best and last hope for a medal, lost to the 39-year old Cuban Juan Carlos Stevens and then said that his relationship with coach Peter Suk was not working.</p> <p>Wills led going into the final end, but Stevens finished 10, 10, 10, meaning that Wills's last arrow, after 9 and 8, was meaningless. The 27-year old from County Durham claimed that he wanted to go out and shoot aggressively, but that Suk, who came to Britain from Korea via the Italian women's team, was preaching calmness.</p> <p>Other Koreans found themselves in trouble. Out at the same stage in the morning went two of their remaining three archers, including Im Dong-Hyun, the reigning world champion, knocked out by Victor Wunderle of the US. Wunderle took on not just the No1-ranked player but also the clock, taking its 30-second countdown to the last tick before shooting.</p> <p>It jangled everyone's nerves, bar his own. As Im came back at him in the final end with two 10s and a 9, Wunderle, a hunting, fishing, pistol-shooting 32-year-old from Mason City, Illinois, held his stress levels in check and his lead intact for a two-point win.</p> <p>Earlier, Lee Chang-Hwan had lost to Cheng Chu Sian of Malaysia, reducing the Koreans in the crowd, the only replete section of the stadium, to silence. They had only their ice-man Park Kyung-Mo left. Not good enough, was the Korean take on their own. And Wills's on his own Korean.</p>",

Until we see the first report of bedroom marathons and empty condom wrappers strewn about the Athletes' Village the Games haven't truly reached full speed, I reckon - but then I've always been a romantic.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.04am:</strong> Aside from the track and field, the nation of Phelpsia will dive back into the Water Cube this morning to resume climbing up the medal tally (he is now 11th, one behind Great Britain), and the 200m individual medley should offer little resistance to the young country's gold medal march.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.12am:</strong> Let's head out to the Bird's Nest, as Britain's <strong>Kelly Sotherton</strong> begins her heptathlon assault. The true test, of course, will come later in the javelin - not exactly her strong suit - but there's no harm in kicking off with a decent showing this morning in the 100m hurdles. The absence of the Athens 2004 gold medallist, Carolina Kluft of Sweden, can't hurt either.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.23am:</strong> Britain's other heptathlon hope, <strong>Julie Hollman</strong>, is first up for GB, and she finishes fourth in her heat. Hollman says that her most humorous moment was being sick during an 800m race - which is exactly how I'd react after running 800m.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.32am:</strong> Across at the men's shot put, we see Reese Hoffa - the 51st American state, by the look of him - propel the pill 21.41m. Reckon he then went off to eat a pizza or 12 for elevenses.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.29am:</strong> <strong>Sotherton</strong> sets off now, and looks confident as she clears the hurdles with ease to finish fourth in her heat in 13.18sec. That impressive effort gives her 1,097 points and places her fourth overall, with Hyleas Fountain of the US leading on 1,158 points. High jump next.<br>See our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1 \">full report</a> of Sotherton's opening effort</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.45am:</strong> Now to the fast show, the men's 100m sprint.

He's only run seven 100m races, but he's still managed to set a world record so the lad's got talent.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.50am:</strong> La, la, la, la, la, la: that was the sound of Bolt humming a merry tune as he strolled to the line in 10.20sec. Sweat? Not on this bloke, not when he's virtually walked into the second round. Ironic that surname, no?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.54am:</strong> Asafa Powell - don't call him Yesterday's Man, not yet at least - is next up, along with Great Britain's <strong>Craig Pickering</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.58am:</strong> So far so good for Asafa, who jogs through to win in 10.16sec. <strong>Pickering</strong> runs an impressive 10.21 to finish third and qualify for the second round. The Brit seemed to require just a bit more effort, though.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.12am:</strong> Off to the pool now, where Australia's Lethal Liesel Jones attempts to win an elusive Olympic gold medal, in the 200m breaststroke final.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.16am:</strong> And it remains elusive for the Australian. Rebecca Soni of the US has no trouble keeping up with the Jones girl and trumps her on the last leg to win the gold medal in 2min 20.22sec. That's another world record in the Cube - is it time we introduced handicaps?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.24am:</strong> To the men's 200m backstroke final, and for once the name Phelps is nowhere to be seen on the results board. Of course, that's because he's not in the race, which was won by his fellow American Ryan Lochte in 1:53.94. Another world record? Silly question. GB's <strong>Gregor Tait</strong> finishes eighth in 1:57, and announces he's going off to Australia for a while. Finishing eighth isn't that bad, surely?</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.29am:</strong> Back to the track, and the US of A's Tyson Gay eases into the 100m second round in 10.22m, slower than his two main rivals but we're talking 0.02sec difference across the three sprinters. Splitting hairs at this stage, perhaps.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.32am:</strong> Hang on a second, says Great Britain's <strong>Tyrone Edgar</strong>, who coasts to victory in the following 100m heat in 10.13sec. Cuts a glance across the line as if to say: \"Don't you forget about me, don't, don't, don't, don't.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.37am:</strong> Humble apologies to Liesel Jones, who of course won the 100m breaststroke gold medal this week. Think I was sleeping at the time. Nice to know you're out there, readers.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.50am: </strong>Here comes Mr Phelps. Five golds so far and now on the blocks for a sixth here in the 200m individual medley.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.55am: </strong>Another gold, another world record. The American master touches in 1:54.23 for gold No6. GB's <strong>James Goddard</strong> finishes sixth in 1:59.24 while <strong>Liam Tancock</strong> is eighth in 2:00.76.</p> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics2\">full report</a> on Phelps' latest triumph</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.58am:</strong> Shamini from Singapore writes to offer this early-morning brainwave on how to make these Olympics better: \"Why not superimpose Brad Pitt's head on Phelps for TV? The greatest athlete in the world but let's face it - those ears, the dorky grin... substitution warranted?? (I don't mean that Brad Pitt should get the medals - although perhaps he could have a copy).\"</p> <p>I reckon it's some of the events that lack spark. If beach volleyball gets a starter's shirt, why not let WWE wrestlers have a crack at Olympic medals? Imagine Batista preparing to finish off John Cena and claim gold, only for JBL to arrive on the scene and smash a chair over the Animal's head? Now <em>that's</em> an Olympic sport.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>4.05am:</strong> GB's <strong>Elizabeth Simmonds</strong> qualifies seventh for the women's 200m backstroke final after finishing her semi-final in 2:08.96. Gemma Spofforth just misses out.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>4.10am:</strong> <strong>Fran Halsall</strong> is GB's hope in the 100m freestyle final, but she's up against the world record holder Lisbeth Trickett, even though the Australian is in lane 8 here.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>4.14am:</strong> Tricky for Trickett to win from out there, though, and she's trumped - just - by Germany's Britta Steffan in 53.12. That's a new Olympic record, which is a nice change from all those dull world marks being set.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4.16am:</strong> \"With all of these new world records being set,\" says reader Richard Greaves, \"has anyone actually thought to measure the pool to check that it is indeed the required 50m? Just a thought!\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4.24am:</strong> Bird's Nest-bound now, for heats nine and 10 in the men's 100m. GB's big hope, <strong>Simeon Williamson</strong>, emerges for the final heat.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.25am:</strong> Third and through for <strong>Williamson.</strong> That's three Brits qualifying for the second round, to be run at lunchtime today.</p> <p>Read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3 \">Paul Kelso</a>'s report</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>4.36am:</strong> GB's <strong>Jemma Simpson</strong> finishes fourth in her 800m heat in 2:02.16, and the former Neighbours extra faces a nervous wait to see if she makes it into the semi-finals.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>4.41am:</strong> <strong>Jenny Simpson</strong> squeezes into the semis with apparent ease, the Brit finishing third in her heat in 2:00.33.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>4.53am:</strong> Quick results scan: In the women's basketball, the Czech Republic have beaten New Zealand 90-59; Spain have toppled China 2-1 in the men's hockey; and the host nation has also suffered defeat in the women's handball, losing to Kazakhstan 29-26.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>4.59am:</strong> North Korean shooting silver medallist Kim Jong-su has tested positive for a banned substance and been excluded from the Games, the International Olympic Committee says this morning. A Vietnamese artistic gymnast, who finished out of the medals, has also tested positive for a banned substance, she said. I've just had a coffee, but I'm sure it's far from performance-enhancing. Sigh.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>5.01am: </strong>In the men's table tennis, Austria account for Croatia 3-1 and Hong Kong topple Taiwan 3-0 in the bronze medal play-offs.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>5.06am:</strong> Alarm bells are ringing for Asafa Powell, who has complained of a stomach problem following his 100m first-round win this morning.</p> <p>Read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3 \">Paul Kelso</a>'s report.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>5.10am:</strong> Back at the table tennis, the US beat Romania 3-1 and Japan beat Austria 3-0 in the women's team bronze medal playoffs.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>5.11am:</strong> \"My wife and I were wondering what to start training our 10-month-old boy in so that he's ready for 2012,\" writes Alex in Sydney. \"As he's small and shouts a lot do you think being the cox of the rowing eight would be a good target?\"</p> <p>Either that, or a broadcaster perhaps.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>5.20am:</strong> Artur Ayvazian of Ukraine wins gold in the men's 50m prone rifle, shooting past Matt Emmons of the US in the final round. Australia's Warren Potent claims the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>5.31am:</strong> Over at the fencing, we have the men's team epee quarter-finals. China pip Hungary 45-43, Poland pummel Ukraine 45-37, Italy do likewise to South Korea 45-37, and France breeze past Venezuela 45-33.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>5.40am:</strong> Well, it's time for a baton change. As the sun rises over Guardianland I'll toddle off now before my eyes file an official complaint. Disappointing that they're revolting, but they're often shortsighted when it comes to work. Over to strong, strong runner Alan Gardner.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>5.49am: 'Sup?</strong> Big praise indeed from Russell... I've been limbering up in the background, and he must have noticed my impressive calves. Although, my desk-accustomed frame has got nothing on either the gymnasts or the beach volleyballers who are currently occupying my attention. And I think the US girls have just nailed their routines in the women's all-around. Is it going to be a dainty slap upside the head for China?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>5.54am:</strong> Chants of <strong>USA! USA! USA!</strong> in the National Indoor Stadium. Shawn Johnson, the pint-sized princess of American gymnastics - who appears to have been confected entirely from pink satin and sunbeams - is lapping up the applause. Blue Peter's Matt Baker doesn't think she's quite done enough though...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>5.57am: USA! USA! USA! take gold... and silver.</strong> China will have to suck their thumb whilst clutching bronze. Baker called it: Johnson had to settle for second; but Nastia Liukin, also a Yank, picked up gold. <strong>Britain's Becky Downie finished a respectable 12th.</strong></p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.00am: Psychedelic cartoon alert.</strong> Must mean it's time for Olympic Breakfast, with the Beeb's finest. Once the animated pigs and monkeys have trotted off, of course...</p> <p>Opinions on Jamie Hewlett's creations? Personally, it seems to have sod all to do with the Games - but looks quite nice.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>6.05am:</strong> And welcome to the global conversation, Australia: \"Where are Britain's next six gold medals coming from then?\" flaming galas Adrian Hill. \"If the Brits are going to beat Australia, that's what you'll need. As for the overall medals count, roll on 2012, eh?\"</p> <p>Well, Adrian, may I point you in the direction of this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympicscycling\">little section of our site</a>? On yer bike, mate.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.10am:</strong> Not a whole lorra 'lympics going on at the moment, as far as I can tell, not least because BBC1 have decided that some events in this country are in some way newsworthy, which I doubt, frankly. Anyway, as part of their services to japery and clowning around, those zany Spaniards have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicstennis\">been at it again</a>. When will they learn...?</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>6.13am: Team GB sailing</strong> You'd have thought with all the corporate suits and politico types guffing their way around Beijing, such a lack wouldn't be problematic, but <strong>we currently have no sailing over in Qingdao because there's no wind.</strong> Ainslie and the Yngling girls are cooling their heels, and possibly drinking some lovely, lovely green tea.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>6.17am: Team GB athletics</strong> Yes, that does read athletics. Kelly Sotherton, one of only two people in Britain who can run without her legs falling off, is doing a cracking job over in the heptathlon. Last I heard she'd gone over 1.77m in the high jump, but it looks like she may have just bettered that.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>6.20am:</strong> Sotherton knocks the bar off at 1.83m, but I think, in going over 1.80m, she's already set a new PB. The American, Hayleas Fountain leads after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1\">storming through the 100m hurdles this morning</a>. But Kelly's just floated over at 1.83m!!! G'wan Kel!</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>6.26am: Team GB archery</strong> Alan Wills' defeat in the men's singles is being re-lived on the Beeb, while Eurosport have gone with this morning's 100m heats.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Andrew Jolly has joined the Aussie de-baiting: \"Yes, as a Brit living in Australia, I've been talking up our cycling team whilst the Aussies sweep up at the swimming (except this morning where Libby &amp; Liesel threw it away). It's a good job choking isn't an attribute of supposedly superior British sports people. Eh? Oh.\" And some classic self-deprecation to round things off. Mr Jolly, you are wasted down there.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>6.31am:</strong> Seems the <a href=\"http://www.olympics.org.uk/beijing2008/AthleteProfile.aspx?id=5585\">Team GB website</a> tells lies about our Kelly, who has in fact jumped 1.87m before. Anyway, there's some judo going on, and some badminton... not that we have much interest in either now.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>6.34am: Acronym fun, with Al Parkes.</strong> \"As for yngling [cf. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1\">yesterday's MBM</a>, 7.15am], when faced with 'epee', and thinking it might be a typo, I googled it and the first thing that caught my eye was 'european partnership for energy and the environment'\" writes Al. \"Sounds worthy, but what do the participants actually do? Do they win points for the extent to which they 'reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of refrigerants'?\" Another convoluted Olympic sport in the offing, maybe.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>6.40am:</strong> Cuba and the US are locked at 2-2 in the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blurnsball\">blurnsball</a>. Still not enough wind for the sailors to have a paddle, so we're reduced to Uzbekistan v Poland in the men's judo.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>6.44am:</strong> Mr Jolly cranks up the pressure on the MBM team (me). \"For some reason, Channel 7 and SBS in Australia aren't covering the athletics today - at the moment we have the mouthwatering choice of Chinese Taipei vs Hong Kong in table tennis or Australia vs Holland in water polo (we don't have new fangled things like 'the red button') down under yet.\" Cue, dramatic music and scenes of MBMer perspiring profusely: \"We're relying completely on MBM to know how the lovely Kelly et al are getting on.\"</p> <p>Well, er... I, er, hang on... just let me switch the chann... bye!</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>6.50am: Fleeing MBMer hits electrified fence around Rebranded Website compound and is corralled back to his seat.</strong> Never fear, text-based sports commentary fans, I'm still here. Not much to report on viz. Ms Sotherton, as there are about 313 competitors in the heptathlon so the high jump wil be some time in finishing.</p> <p>More scandal news, however. According to Reuters, the Chinese faked the ethnicity of some of the kids at the opening ceremony. For shame.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>6.55am:</strong> More people in need, this time Amy from America and Max from Germany who are \"on hols without TV and are counting on you!\" Great. At least their request is simple. Yes, Amy and Max, Germany do have eight golds, our table is just reluctant to acknowledge the facts currently.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>7.00am:</strong> An Estonian judoka is trying to give his Brazilian opponent what looks like a chinese burn. Must be something in the Beijing air. Meanwhile, word is that Kel failed at 1.83m, so my earlier optimism was misplaced/erroneous.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>7.03am:</strong> Peru v Cuba on the mat... and Cuba hands out some ippon pain straight away. Still 2-2 in the baseball.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>7.07am:</strong> If you missed the exciting denouement to USA! USA! USA! crushing 'One World. One Dream' China in the gymnastics earlier, why not read the full report <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympicsgymnastics.olympics2008\">here</a>. The fun part is... wait for it, wait for it... really, a Russian won. What a delightful Cold War triptych, eh.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>7.12am: Are you listening, Australia? You're rubbish.</strong> Or words to that effect. \"As a Brit living in Brisbane, i'm wondering if the Aussies, following on from the rugby world cup - where the rules must now be changed so that a team with no scrum can win - will now float some ELVs for swimming,\" enquires John Davis, with a mischievous grin all over his mush. \"I mean the Americans getting from the start to the finish in the fastest time, whilst following a straight line, is something of a hollow victory isn't it?\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>7.17am: Chiles shows some love.</strong> The Beeb are running (Australian former world record holder) Leisel Jones choking in the 200m breaststroke again, from earlier this morning. But before that, we had Adrian Chiles flapping his chops about the Guardian and in particular <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/michaelphelps.swimming1\">this piece on Michael Phelps' diet</a>. And if you'd like to see a normal person (Jon Henley) try and tackle that amount of calories, click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/15/foodanddrink.michaelphelps\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>7.21am: Team GB judo</strong> Some results:</p> <p>Kim Nayoung (South Korea) beat Nihel Cheikh Rouhou (Tunisia)<br>Tong Wen (China) beat Maryna Prokofyeva (Ukraine)<br>Idalys Ortiz (Cuba) beat Samah Ramadan (Egypt)<br>Lucija Polavder (Slovenia) beat Gulzhan Issanova (Kazakhstan)<br>Janelle Shepherd (Australia) beat Sandra Koeppen (Germany)<br>Tserenkhand Dorjgotov (Mongolia) beat Carola Uilenhoed (Netherlands)<br><strong>Vanessa Zambotti (Mexico) beat Karina Bryant (Britain)</strong><br>Maki Tsukada (Japan) beat Anne-Sophie Mondiere (France)</p> <p>We're down to 'golden score' in the men's judo, France v Uzbekistan. Can you contain your, etc and so forth...</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>7.25am:</strong> No sailing, remember, due to a lack of wind. The French judoka, who looks like a bear, is taking it to the Uzbeki, who looks like an accountant.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>7.35am:</strong> Some of our top stories now up in the standfirst, there. Bit of a newspapery word, standfirst. You and I can call it, 'slightly washed-out text beneath the headline', if you like.</p> <p>And news of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.drugsinsport\">some disqualifications for nasty drug cheats</a>, brought to you with nothing more than the pure blood, sweat and tears of the Guardian team.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>7.38am:</strong> Upstanding fellow and noble Englishman-on-foreign-shores Andrew Jolly is disappointed with the complete lack of 'bring it' being shown by Australian readers. \"Typical, they start off the sledging, fueled by weak beer and sunstroke, but as soon as a couple of Brits slap them around a bit back they go, retreating to the BBQ...\" complains Andy, who likes a sporting contest.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>7.44am: Sotherton watch</strong> It seems that in the confusion and to-and-fro of instantaneous reporting, Kelly did indeed clear 1.83m, but that wasn't quite up there with some of the best. <strong>She's lying in fifth, after the two events so far</strong>, and you can read some proper journalism on the subject <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.britisholympicteam1\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>7.48am:</strong> The American with the barmy handle, Hyleas Fountain, is top o'the tree in the heptathlon. Clare Balding loves Kelly Sotherton \"because she's got attitude\". And cos she's such a feisty type, the bods on the BBC couch reckon she'll have been none too pleased about having to wait two hours to have a go on the high jump.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>7.56am:</strong> Brett Badger, who refuses to declare himself as an Australian but probably is, weighs in for the Sheilas: \"l must admit to being a little confused by all this British babble. Perhaps the medal tally l am looking at which shows Australia miles ahead of our Imperial Overlords is wrong?\" [at this point Badger, whose name sounds made up, proffers a link to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/medals/full\">Guardian medal table</a>, mocking us with our own fancy technology] \"Or am l to understand we are being criticised for not being further ahead of Team GB? OK, l guess that would fit in with the general self flagellating principles of British sport.\" It is customary to let the hare get well out in front before it is overhauled, Brett. In this case by a tortoise on an advanced carbon fibre bicycle.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>8.00am:</strong> While Gary Naylor endures a Kluft-less and therefore Sotherton-less broadcasting landscape in Sweden, I'm stuck with reruns and news segments. Oh, and USA 3-3 Cuba in the baseball. \"With no Kluft-mania to drive the coverage here in Sweden, television has cut away from the Bird's Nest and is now showing Germany vs Sweden in the women's handball,\" laments Gary. \"You wouldn't think it would be possible to make 14 super-fit, Amazonian, European women a-stretching and a-straining dull. But handball manages it.\" To be honest, I'd like to take an objective decision for myself on that one, but not even the internet can help me here (and don't get cheeky...)</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.10am: Team GB</strong> Up later, there'll be some rowing, with Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter in the men's lightweight double sculls. The cycling - also known as the basket in which I've placed all my eggs in a verbal spat with Australia - should start in an hour or so, where the Brits will be looking to vanquish the French.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.15am:</strong> Andrew Jolly, my partner in crimes against the Australian nation, is beginning to get the wobbles after Brett Badger's robust assault: \"We (the British) are going to look right stupid a bit later on if we all fall off [our bikes]. Actually, as we've talked it up a fair amount, we're going to look right stupid if we don't win 10 gold medals. Not that I'm stepping back towards my BBQ, Agincourt spirit and all that...\" Badger, real name or not, you've certainly brought it.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.23am: Team GB athletics</strong> Marilyn Okoro and Jenni Meadows both qualified for the 800m earlier. Not sure we mentioned Marilyn at the time. There's one track gold up for grabs today, but it's not till much later (3.45pm BST).</p> <p>Oh, and in the Amazon-ball, it seems to be Germany 26-27 Sweden... but I'm not really sure how the scoring works. Maybe Gary Naylor can help?</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>8.29am:</strong> News on the baseball from Kyle Hauptman, who has Sydney and Tokyo numbers in his email signature, so I'm going to assume is approximately somewhere in the middle of the Philippines.</p> <p>China 8-7 Chinese Taipei<br>Cuba 5-4 USA</p> <p>The spectre of communism is haunting baseball, then. Or something.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8.35am:</strong> Almost time for me to chuck in the towel and head home for some kip. Howard Swains will be taking over from me, and he's a stirling chap with a full head of glorious hair. Get ready though, cos some <strong>Brits appear to be out on the lake at Shunyi</strong>...</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>8.43am:</strong> OK, something got lost there in the transition in personnel, but it seems that Britain finished fifth in the lake which, ordinarily, is never good enough to qualify. I'll try to confirm that failure momentarily, but I think we can assume the British pair are out.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>8.47am: Prepared introduction:</strong> Morning again to all, and welcome back to Beijing, being brought to you via a tiny Hitachi screen and an uncertain internet connection channelling an uncertain web-stream. These are the mysteries unravelled.</p> <p>This is the greatest show on earth which, incidentally, is also the name of a song by the rather excellent <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zAioPRKmN4\">Felice Brothers</a> that appeared on my I-Pod this morning. \"I'm in a suit of burgundy/There's a deerhead lookin' at me/It's blowin my mind away.\" That is what it's like at Guardian Towers on day seven of the Olympics. </p> <p>Today's deerhead will be eyeing some canoe/kayaking, some archery, some judo, weightlifting, fencing, shot put, badminton, athletics (where Kelly Sotherton in the heptathlon is the main British attraction) and the chance of some British metal acquisition in the cycling. I haven't so far presided over a single British medal win, but have high hopes for today. The wind has even got up in the right place, offering the prospect of some sailing, and died down elsewhere, permitting some rowing, both of which were postponed yesterday.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.beijing2008.cn/\">official Beijing Olympics website</a> sometimes struggles to keep up with what's going on around the whole Games, which can throw us (OK, me) for a loop.</p> <p>Please send in your observations, comments, complaints and typo-spots to <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>8.48am: Unprepared introduction:</strong> Some women rowers have just come fifth in the sculling and have not qualified for the final. \"We gave it our best shot and it's really, really gutting not to reach the final,\" says Helen Casey. Her ship-mate Hester Goodsell is similarly disappointed. \"We're just not quite there yet,\" she says. \"Have a good scull tomorrow,\" pipes up Steve Redgrave.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>8.51am:</strong> Turns out that this telly is actually a Tosumi, not a Hitachi as previously advertised. In the second <strong>sculling</strong> semi-final, Canada beat China who beat Greece.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>8.54am</strong> The British men have just started their semi-final in the double sculls. \"What a fascinating six minutes this will be,\" insists John Inverdale.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> The British pair -- Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter -- are way out in front at the half-way mark, leading the Cubans, Italians and French boats. This one is in the bag.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.02am: Purchase and Hunter cruise into the final of the men's lightweight double sculls</strong> with a comfortable victory in the semi finals. Italy and Cuba come second and third. The final is not for another 48 hours, but there are now very high hopes for gold in the lake. </p> <p>This from table-tennis correspondent Tim Maitland: \"Alan teased us with a mention of the Hong Kong v Chinese Taipei table tennis match, without giving the result or capturing the humungous importance of it. Hong Kong's first medal of the Games! A 3-0 sweep of the-island-otherwise-known-as-Taiwan in the bronze medal match, sealed by Athens-silver-medal-winning legends Li Ching and Ko Lai-Chak in the doubles.\" That's that covered.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.03am: Drug cheat news: </strong> North Korean shooter Kim Jong Su has been stripped of his two medals for failing a drugs test. I'm actually not sure how \"new\" this news is, but I hadn't noticed it yet, even though there's an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7726560\">article being fed onto the Guardian website about it</a>.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.10am:</strong> Here are our options for live coverage: Clare Balding in ravishing pink, women's 75kg weightlifting, women's team semi-final table tennis, boxing or sailing. Over to you. (Bear in mind that one email vote would probably win this.)</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.16am:</strong> I'm watching some sailing at the moment because there appear to be a British boat involved, skippered (is that the right word?) by Ben Ainslie, who is a definite medal prospect. There's some terrific rhythmic chanting going on courtesy of the Chinese fans on the harbour side, but otherwise I'm at a bit of a loss as to what's really going on. In the rowing lake, Greece beat Denmark beat China in the second lightweight sculls semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>9.17am:</strong> Joe Milton wants boxing; Julian Wilson wants Clare Balding in the weightlifting. That's a dead heat, so I'm sticking with the sailing.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>9.20am:</strong> They've started a 5-minute, 16-boat race in the sailing and deciphering is currently is progress. Meanwhile, the first semi-final of the lightweight fours has just ended in the rowing lake, and Poland won, with Canada and Holland in their slipstream.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>9.22am:</strong> British interests take precedence here, and the men's lightweight fours -- Chambers, Lindsay-Fynn, Mattick and Clarke -- are going in lane two of the rowing lake, against Ireland, Denmark, France, Italy and the USA. Britain are current world champions, so are hotly tipped. And they're off.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>9.26am:</strong> Britain lead. Gary Naylor is in Sweden, and Ranil Dissanayake, who claims to be our most exotically-located reader, being based in Malawi, says \"Boxing! Boxing!\" on the grounds that: \"The skills are all there without any of the queasy liberal guilt of watching the pros maim each other without the protection.\" Hold still, let's get this rowing out the way, and I'll check back on the pugilists.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>9.28am:</strong> Denmark have gone into the lead against Great Britain in the <strong>rowing</strong> after 1,500m. This is only the semi-final, remember, so second is good enough to go through. Ben Ainslie is ahead in his race in the <strong>Finn class sailing</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>9.30am: Great Britain qualify in third place in the men's lightweight fours. </strong>Denmark win the semi-final, France are second, but the World Champions (that'll be the Brits) are through. Ireland were fourth, and have another chance to qualify in some kind of race off.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>9.32am: </strong> Dan Smith has the coveted 9.32am update all to himself: \"Can I be the first to mark Team GB's triumphant Government funded march to 2012? We seem to be working with an illustrious combination of reliable bankers (sailing, rowing, cycling), relatively impressive stasis (white water canoeing, 3-day eventing), individual excellence marred by appalling relay error (swimming), slight improvement unnoticed because it's so far down the field (gymnastics) decline (badminton, archery), marked decline (shooting), predicted continued decline (athletics), irreversible decline/abject embarrassing failure (judo), more abject failure (diving), ridiculous hype coupled with abject embarrassing failure at both individual and organisational level (boxing, see Frankie Gavin) and non-qualification (almost everything else).\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>9.34am:</strong> At the third mark in the yngling race, the Dutch team are ahead, with the Brits in third. Ben Ainslie, in the Finn class, is \"doing what he does best\" according to the Beeb's enthusiastic boat-bound commentator, who is kind of angular and looks as though he's peering into the back of a spoon.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Apologies to Irish rowing fans, your boys are out. They get to race in the B final, but can't qualify for the final, as Joanne Harris, a Brit in New Zealand has just emailed to tell me. If anyone knows the point of the B final, please let me know. Meanwhile, the Slovak brothers Pavol and Peter Hochschorner have won gold in the men's canoe doubles. Having improbably enough spent three months in Slovakia last year, I can tell you those Hochschorners are heroes over there.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>9.44am:</strong> They're preparing for action in the velodrome, the second heat of the men's team sprint. Greece go up against Malaysia. Britain are up in heat six. Wow, that was quick. It's all over in just over 44 seconds, with Malaysia winning it.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>9.50am:</strong> China against Japan in heat six in the velodrome, and it's a disaster for Japan, one of those three riders has a problem with his back wheel and drops out right at the start. A puncture, it seems, as a Chinese Wile E. Coyote is seen creeping out of the arena carrying a box of ACME tacks.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>9.53am:</strong> Thanks again to Joanne Harris for her insight into the rowing. \"And the point of the B final?\" she writes. \"It's about the same as the point of the C and D finals (and E and F, for the singles at these Olympics). It's for FISA (the international rowing federation) placings, so the minor rowing countries know where they've come overall - funding within the countries can depend on it. It's not unimportant, given that 60 nations sent crews to the rowing in Beijing, and occasionally it pays off. Cuba beating Germany is priceless and definitely wouldn't have happened a few years ago.\" Excellent. I genuinely didn't know, so thanks for the info.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>9.56am:</strong> Australia v Russia in the cycling, and the Aussies take it in 44.335seconds, which is the fastest yet. Russia were seventh fastest so far. The Japanese, meanwhile, didn't get a puncture, but one of their riders' chain snapped, so they'll get another chance. Great Britain are up next. (And, Amy from America and Max from Germany, the Germany/Sweden women's handball finished 27-26 in favour of the Swedes.)</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> Here it is then: Great Britain share the track with Germany in heat six. Britain are represented here by Chris Hoy, Jason Kenny and Jamie Staff. Staff goes like the wind in the first lap, Kenny takes over for the second, leaving Hoy to <strong>BREAK THE WORLD RECORD!!!</strong></p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>10.02am: GREAT BRITAIN BREAK THE WORLD RECORD IN THE HEATS OF THE TEAM SPRINT</strong>. It's a phenomenal achievement from Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy. Staff rides the fastest opening lap of any rider ever and Kenny/Hoy keep the pace to finish in 42.950 seconds. Their previous best was 43.777, so that's extraordinary. France and Holland go head to head in heat seven and the French posted the second-fastest time behind that universe best ever cycling feat by three men on two wheels and a bit of fibreglass EVER!</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>10.07am:</strong> Apparently, this cycling track in Beijing, the Laoshan Velodrome, was always expected to be a fast one, and that world record is not as surprising as it seemed to me (and to the cyclists' mothers, who are all in the crowd and chewing on a British flag like it's a comfort blanky.) Again, over to you lot: how and why is one cycling track faster than another?</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>10.11am:</strong> <strong>Ben Ainslie guaranteed at least silver in Finn class sailing</strong> As all our (my) attention was on the velodrome, Ben Ainslie finished second in his latest race in the Finn class sailing and is now guaranteed at least a silver medal. There are two races left and gold is very much in his sights. If only everyone was either on a bike or a boat. Great Britain would rule the world.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>10.15am:</strong> Simon Thomas is asking for trouble, or is at least encouraging me to get into trouble: \"Can you don your fashion critic hat for me and describe the plastic suits worn by our cycling heroes? I can't get to a telly so can't see for myself but I'm hoping they've kind of come over all batman on us.\" Well, there are no capes and there are no pointy ears but otherwise, yes.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>10.20am: </strong>The men's individual pursuit cycling is now underway, and Brett Lancaster of Australia is fastest in the first heat. Steven Burke of the newly-enthused Team GB! GB! GB! goes in the second heat, which is starting .... now!</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>10.25am: </strong> <strong>Steven Burke</strong> trounces his track-mate, the Colombian Alzate, lapping him in fact, and beats his own personal best by nine seconds. <strong>He finishes in 4.22.2, which puts him first from the four who have been out so far</strong>. More wonderful stuff from the British cyclists. Graham Pierce has the skinny on velodromes: \"Beijing is fast mainly because it's new and the surface is clean and blemish free. When velodromes periodically replace the boards speeds always pick up. The angle of banking and tightness of the curves is also a big factor, when the curves are tighter and G forces higher times suffer particularly in the sprint events. This was the case at the world champs in Los Angeles a few years ago. The weather conditions on the day also play a part and generally when it's warmer times are faster. Finally Moscow is known as a really fast track because the aircon system is set up to give the riders a tailwind right the way round the track.\" Is that really true about Moscow? Not that I'm doubting, or anything, but isn't that like installing a huge fan underneath the pole vault run-up, or a motor on the back of a yngling boat?</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>10.29am:</strong> Another gold medal for Slovakia in the white water singles kayak as Elena Kaliska defends her Olympic championship. They're some canoe/kayakers are the Slovaks and they now move ahead of Team GB! GB! GB! in the medals table. They don't have quite the strength in depth in the cycling or sailing, however. So we'll be back.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>10.35am:</strong> A couple more shiny hyper-links for you to click in the standfirst up there, which will take you through to stories about the cycling world record and Ben Ainslie's sailing antics.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>10.40am:</strong> \"Was that really a world record for the cyclists?\" asks Andrew Jolly, who says that the Australian television coverage has not mentioned it at all. Well, everyone is still reporting that it's a world record, although the usually hyperbolic Press Association have included this caveat in their most recent dispatch: \"There is no world record for the event as the team sprint is held over three laps, regardless of the size of the track.\" They still lead the same piece with the line: \"Britain set up a great chance of winning the first gold medal awarded at the Laoshan Velodrome by qualifying for the first round of the team sprint in unofficial record time.\" So, if the track sizes vary, then there can't be any official world record, it seems. But it stands that the British trio have just recorded the fastest time ever in that event, and you can bet your life that if the Aussies had done it, news of a new world record would be all over the surf club and being shaved into Bouncer's soft labrador fur.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>10.52am: </strong>OK, let's get a grip here. The individual pursuit is underway in the velodrome, with <strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong> up soon. <strong>The British Yngling crew -- Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson -- have now guaranteed at least bronze</strong> in their sailing class, and still have an outside chance of gold. Roger Federer's vanquisher James Blake is into a final set against Fernando Gonzalez in the tennis; Brazil are about to play Norway in the quarter finals of the women's football, and much, much more. </p> <p>There's a lot of AAARRGGHHing coming my way from Alex Pace, who is watching the cycling in Australia. \"AAAARGGGHHHH,\" he aaarghhhs. \"In Australia, they are only showing the Aussie cyclists but even worse hey have put some ignorant Aussie buffoon in the commentary box with the commentating legend that is Phil Liggett, his sole purpose seems to be to interrupt, contradict and irritate the silver-tongued Liggett with observations about how BLOODY GREAT the Australian cyclists are. AAAAARGHHHHH.\"</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>10.59am: </strong>\"An under-ripe banana is as bad for you as a biscuit,\" says the commentator on the tennis. I'm not sure who it is, but she follows up with: \"There's all sorts of banana analysis that's been done.\" Flicking through these internet streams is a lot like listening to snippets of conversations on the tube or something. There's probably some context, but it's usually missed. I'm not sure what Gary Naylor is on about here, either, but it's always good to have him: \"Can anyone confirm if the crowd in Olympic velodrome has adopted the same practices as the crowds in the Belgian Six Day events - specifically, smoking, boozing and eating chips with mayonnaise? Possibly not, I suspect.\" And Roger Cook is thinking of shaving the world record cycling time in to his cats, photographs of which would persuade me to learn how to embed images into this minute-by-minute sports coverage tool to share with the world.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>11.07am:</strong> <strong>Bradley Wiggins </strong>is on the track in the final heat of the individual pursuit. Steven Burke is still leading, I think, although Wiggins is da man. More on the is-it-isn't-it a world record in the team sprint comes courtesy of Simon Carmouche: \"Most but not all tracks are 250m, so it's not meaningless even though not official.\" Not meaningless, if not official. Is it wrong to adopt that as a life ambition?</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>11.10am:</strong> <strong>Bradley Wiggins eases to the fastest qualifying time in the individual pursuit, and sets a new Olympic record to boot.</strong> The time is 4.15.031. And he'll lead the New Zealander Haydn Rolleston when they reconvene.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>11.13am:</strong> Wiggins was awesome there, and is a clear favourite for gold. Rolleston was second-fastest, then Markov, Dyadnya and then Steven Burke. Steven Gagola, who's pretty sharp on the old email, is angry: \"Your lack of info annoys me. So the British Yngling crew are<br>guaranteed a bronze! Where are they on the current standings and where<br>did they finish today?\" Sorry about that Steven, it did kind of creep up on us. They finished fifth in today's race 8, but still lead the overall standings, which look like this: 1 Gr Britain 22.0 pts, 2 Netherlands 23.0 pts, 3 Greece 42.0 pts, 4 United States 43.0 pts, 5 France 46.0 pts, 6 Russian Feder 46.0 pts, 7 China 47.0 pts, 8 Australia 49.0 pts, 9 Germany 52.0 pts, 10 Norway 57.0 pts, 11 Finland 60.0 pts, 12 S Africa 63.0 pts, 13 Canada 66.0 pts, 14 Spain 67.0 pts, 15 Italy 74.0 pts.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>11.17am:</strong> The team pursuit semi-finals (or second round) are underway. I missed the first one -- these really do fly by -- but I understand that Australia won it, but that Germany recorded a faster time in the second. The British world record holders* are out soon. (*Not an official world record), but first we have Malaysia and France.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>11.22am: </strong>The division of labour here in Guardian Towers is severely imbalanced. The entire media desk behind me are riveted by television coverage of a penguin being knighted at Edinburgh zoo by the Norwegian army. You. Couldn't. Make. It. Up. France won that team sprint against the Malaysians, and the French are quickest so far, from Germany and Australia.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>11.24am:</strong> Team GB! GB! GB!'s (unofficial) World Record holders are on the track. They're up against the United States. Here they go...</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>11.24 and 43.034 seconds am:</strong> Another superlative effort from Staff, Kenny and Hoy who, in that order, have taken the Brits through to the final to face France in the final of the team sprint. The bronze medal ride off will be between Germany and Australia.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>11.26am: GB through to final in team sprint</strong>. Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy will ride for the gold medal against France, a repeat of the World Championship final. Australia and Germany will contest the bronze, which will no doubt please Cameron McCallum, who I suspect is from Down Under: \"Just wondering why you're getting so excited about about a guaranteed bronze,\" says McCallum, mistaking this line \"<strong>The British Yngling crew -- Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson -- have now guaranteed at least bronze</strong>\" for excitement. \"That wouldn't even make the news in Australia. You can have a couple of ours for a while if it makes you feel better.\" Are they yours to give away Cameron?</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>11.34am:</strong> Some talking up, and some dressing down: \"Short of falling off, Brad Wiggins and the team sprinters must have golds in the bag. Or is that hubris?\" says Ga Naylor, obviously friendly enough with Mr Wiggins to drop the \"ley\". For what it's worth, yes it's hubris, but let's hope it's not misplaced. Meanwhile Tim Chadderton and Paul McMillan are right to say I understated the Yngling team's chance of gold. They lead after eight races, so have it all to lose. Which, as it happens, etc., and so forth.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>11.38am: </strong>I can't say I'm all that keen on this, but my inbox is positively groaning from emails from you lot asking me to stick it to the Aussies. \"After tomorrow, we shan't need Cameron McCallum's hand outs, as I believe we will be above the Aussies in the medal table,\" says Richard Alderson, whose comments are fairly representative. Meanwhile the news wires report that Australian cyclists Brad McGee and Brett Lancaster are out of the individual pursuit, the event in which nice and British Bradley Wiggins seems nailed on for gold, and David Hopkins provides a link to an <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24174888-5012768,00.html\">Australian newspaper story which details a Hong Kong man's attempt to have sex with a park bench</a>. (Warning, link goes to story in an Australian newspaper about a Hong Kong man attempting to have sex with a park bench. With video of the rescue.)</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>11.46am:</strong> Claire Wright speaks for a lot of us here, but has made a mistake in thinking we can clear it up: \"So Bradley Wiggins can set a new Olympic record (11.10am), but (10.02am) the team sprint can't set a new world record. Did Wiggins cycle a set distance rather than number of laps so the length of track (11.07am comment) doesn't matter?\" I really, really don't know. The television coverage definitely flashed up \"Olympic record\" for Wiggins, and also flashed up the same for the team sprint. It didn't, thinking about it now, flash up \"World record\", however. Official/unofficial, Olympic/World. Who cares, huh? GB! GB! GB!</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>11.53am: </strong>Roget Federer's vanquisher James Blake and Fernando Gonzalez are involved in a titanic battle on the tennis court. It's eight games all in the final set (of three) with no tie-break in sight. I actually wrote about this earlier, but those computer gremlins seem to have deleted it. This happens a lot.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>11.55am: </strong>The velodrome is now hosting the women's 3,000m individual pursuit, in which GB! GB! GB! is represented Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero (if the British Olympic team website is correct, which I hope it is). \"In disciplines like the team sprint where the event can be raced over non-standard tracks (thus the distance can vary) the terminology for the British team's achievement is \"world best\",\" asserts John Ogmore, and earns my gratitude. \"On events like the 4000m pursuit the fixed distance allows it to be called a world record no matter which track it is ridden on.\" Thanks to all, who said much the same thing.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12pm:</strong> Houvenaghel has started her individual pursuit and is in pursuit of/being pursued by the American cyclist Sarah Hammer. The Brit is a second ahead after 2km.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.05pm: Wendy Houvenaghel sets a personal best of 3mins28.443secs in the 3,000m individual pursuit, the fastest time after five heats. </strong>Rebecca Romero is next up, against Katie Mactier, of Australia.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>12.08pm</strong> Fernando Gonzalez has broken James Blake's serve and is now serving for the match at 10-9 in the final set. Meanwhile Rebecca Romero trounced her Aussie opponent in the individual pursuit and is the second fastest qualifier, behind her team-mate Wendy Houvenaghel. Have some bold text: <strong>Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero qualify first and second fastest in the women's 3,000m individual pursuit.</strong></p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>12.11pm:</strong> Are you watching Cameron McCullum? If so, you've just seen your country miss out on third place in the men's team sprint, as Germany edged it on the line to take the bronze medal race. It's the final next, between France and GB! GB! GB!</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>12.15pm: GB! GB! GB! win GOLD in men's team sprint</strong> Terrific stuff from the British cycling team, who set a world best in the heat, cruised through the semi and have now completed the gold medal charge by thrashing the French team, who take silver. Delirious scenes. GB! GB! GB!</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>12.20pm:</strong> Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy will soon be on the podium with a big chunk of gold around their neck. Staff was characteristically exceptional in the first leg, Kenny kept the pace over the second and Hoy anchored it perfectly. Gonzalez beat Blake in the tennis, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>12.27pm:</strong> Over to the National Stadium, Beijing, for the heats of the men's 1,500m. Andy Baddeley goes in one of these heats for GB! GB! GB! and has the British commentators all afluster. In the tennis, Gonzalez will play either Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal in the final. Their semi takes place later today. \"Is Cameron McCullum's e-mail the most ill-timed piece of jingoistic tub-thumping, or was it simply the dawning realisation that he is fast running out of time to make such a comment?\" asks Robert Hill. Timing, as any comedian will tell you, is 90 percent perspiration.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Tom Lancashire, the British \"hope\" in the second heat of the men's 1,500m finishes out of the qualification places in seventh. A 19-year-old Kenyan, whose name is on the tip of my fingers, wins it.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>12.37pm:</strong> Andy Baddely leaves it late but looks comfortable in the third heat of the 1,500m to qualify. He sits at the back of the pack for the first couple of laps, which frightens Bredan Foster in the commentary box, but edges forward through the final 600m and comes good on the back straight, where he is forced wide but has the savvy to get into the first few across the line. Five qualify and he's safely through in fourth. \"I..puff...thought...puff...it...puff...was...puff...bang...on,\" says Baddely himself.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>12.40pm</strong> The heptathletes are back in town and that means Kelly Sotherton. Her first put in the shot put goes 13.87m which is \"solid enough\" according to someone who knows more than me. Just previously, Anna Bogdanova put one 14.04, which is presumably more solid.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> \"I've never heard of this \"on the tip of my fingers' guy,\" zings Chris Riley. \"What's his previous form?\" Don't know about other events, but he seems to win a lot when I'm on M-B-M duty. I still can't actually find out the winners of those 1,500m heats, but assume they'll be filtering onto <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/events/aug/15\">our results page</a> soon-ish.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>12.53pm:</strong> It's the men's 100m second round now, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3\">Gay, Powell and Bolt are all comfortably through from the first round.</a> Simeon Williamson, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2008/aug/05/simeon.williamson.olympics.beijing\">previously boasted that he's a medal prospect</a>, is in the first race. And he's out. He finished fourth, with the top three qualifying, who were: Churandy Martina, from Michael Frater and Naoki Tsukahara. Williamson is \"going back to the drawing room\" according to his post-race interview.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1pm:</strong> Tyson Gay goes in the second round two race. Metre-by-metre coverage has proven to be just a pipe dream, incidentally. There's a false start before they finally get away and Richard Thompson from Trinidad and Tobago wins it in 9.99, after a slow start. Gay is comfortably through in second, but looked a touch rusty. He'll need to improve.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.03pm: </strong>\"This \"on the tips of my fingers\" implies that you are actually typing this,\" says Simon Martin. \"This is a revelation. I previously pictured you lot sunk into a big armchair in front of a large TV barking dictation to some poor sod on minimum wage.\" That, Simon, is over-by-over cricket coverage you're talking about. \"Toss another typo in the mix, intern. Keep them on their toes.\"</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.07pm:</strong> Another false start in the third round-two 100m race allows some football updates or, more precisely, a solitary football update. the Brazilian women are through to the final after beating Norway 2-1. Dinara Safina has taken the first set off Jelena Jankovic in the women's tennis semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> <strong>GB! GB! GB!'s Tyrone Edgar finishes third in his second-round heat of the 100m in 10.10 and goes through to tomorrow's semi final.</strong> Marc Burns wins it, Kim Collins is second and they both qualify alongside Edgar.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>1.11pm: </strong>Tempted as I am to fill this MBM with the non-stop barrage of anti-Australian sentiment that is pouring into my inbox, I <em>do</em> want to get served in the bars of Earls Court next time I go there, so I'm going to have to omit most of it. Andrew Jolly, Alex Pace and Chris Bridge, are suffering at the hands of the Australian broadcasters, meanwhile, and have been forced to watch handball and gymnastics repeats instead of the British cycling win. Bridge offers: \"If two slugs were crawling up a wall and one was painted green and gold it would make the news here.\"</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>1.15pm: </strong>That is absolutely extraordinary. Usain Bolt has just <em>jogged</em> to victory in the fourth 100m second-round heat, running 9.92secs without even breaking sweat. \"How much is still in the engine?\" asks the track-side commentator. \"A lot,\" Bolt replies. It really was amazing: he hardly seemed to strain <em>at all</em> and yet won by a mile. Craig Pickering, of GB! GB! GB! finished back in sixth in 10.18 and does not qualify. \"I'm gutted,\" says Pickering. \"Congratulations,\" says the interviewer, inappropriately.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> Asafa Powell also ambles into tomorrow's semi-finals, winning his heat in 10.02 but no less comfortably than Bolt. Walter Dix, of the United States, is second and Derrick Atkins third. There are no Brits. Pay attention to John Davis: \"Ease up on the pre-emptive gloating with the Aussies eh? Remember that we are British and that the order of the Universe requires that the wheels fall off (probably literally) our gold medal charge soon.\"</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>1.26pm:</strong> Replays of the <strong>Usain Bolt</strong> run are now on repeat on the telly, and rightly so. \"What am I supposed to say?\" says Michael Johnson, who is paid to say something in the BBC commentary box. \"We're pretty much guaranteed a world record in the 100 metres,\" he adds. Kelly Sotherton holds onto fifth place in the heptathlon after the shot put, although her best throw was way short of her personal best, and Nataliia Dobrynska broke the record for a heptathlete in that event and leapt up to second in the leaderboard.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>1.32pm: </strong>Turns out -- as many of you have pointed out -- that I understated the extent of the <strong>Yngling</strong> team's achievement earlier. The always-accurate television is confidently declaring that they're set for at least silver and not at least bronze, as previously reported. They're one point ahead of the Holland crew and simply need to finish in front of the Dutch to win.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>1.35pm:</strong> As the BBC show footage of three tearful British <strong>cyclists</strong> -- Messrs Staff, Kelly and Hoy -- receiving their gold medals for team sprint triumph, news reaches that a French team -- presumably Messrs Porthos, Athos and Aramis -- has won the men's <strong>epee</strong> competition, catapulting France ahead of Britain in the medal table.</p> <p>\"Forget the negativity - talk it up!\" booms Richard Greaves, who actually just wants to tell us that he's going to the Games tomorrow. \"There are plenty more medals to come from our velodrome boys and girls (well there had better be, I'm going tomorrow night and Monday).\"</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>1.45pm:</strong> Back to the Bird's Nest stadium, where Helen Clitheroe goes in the heats of the <strong>3,000m steeplechase</strong>, an event making its Olympic debut in Beijing (the women's version, at least). They're not talking up her chances, mind you, with ten of the field having run faster than Clitheroe's personal best.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>1.49pm</strong> Here's something about the steeplechase I've just learned from Wikipedia (which is the sole reason that A Level pass rates continue to rise, in my opinion. Wikipedia, not the steeplechase): \"The event originated in the British Isles. Runners raced from one town's steeple to the next. The steeples were used as markers due to their visibility over long distances. Along the way runners inevitably had to jump creeks and low stone walls separating estates.\" I like the use of the word \"inevitably\" there, as if there aren't two steeples in the entire land without a couple of creeks and stone walls between them. Clitheroe is going great guns, by the way, and is on course for a British record.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>1.52pm</strong> <strong>Helen Clitheroe finishes sixth in the 3,000m steeplechase</strong>. It's probably not good enough to qualify (top four go through, plus a couple of fastest losers from three races), but it's a massive personal best, 10 seconds better than she's ever run before, a British record, and we'll give her a big Team GB! GB! GB! pat on the back for that.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>1.57pm:</strong> \"Your etymology of steeplechase is interesting, but refers to the horseback version I feel. I know this because of pictures on biscuit tins.\" Nope, Gary Naylor, nope. You and your biscuit tins can <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeplechase_%28athletics%29\">eat this link</a> which takes you to the athletics disambiguation of steeplechase. In another heat, incidentally, there was a huge pile up over the water jump and I suspect some photographers will have got it. Check out our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/11/olympics20081?picture=336621666\">weird Olympic photos gallery</a>, where I expect it to appear overnight.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.08pm: </strong>More steeplechase news and it's of the \"agonising\" variety for Team GB and brave Helen Clitheroe in particular. Despite fearing her run wouldn't be good enough, she was given massive hope throughout the final heat when she seemed set to go through as one of the three fastest losers. But at the last minute, an Italian athlete just pipped her and it will be her to who will have to do all that running between the Beijing steeples over creeks and walls again on Sunday. Hard luck Helen.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>2.10pm:</strong> Humliating backtrack here: Gary Naylor was right about the steeplechase. He usually is right. The athletics took its name from the horse race, where the horses were jumping over walls and creeks and not brave athletes named after towns in Lancashire. Sorry Gary. Back to the action, Great Britain are playing South Africa in the hockey and David Davies has made it to the final of the 1,500m freestyle. Grant Hacket, going for his third gold in a row in this event, broke the Olympic record in qualifying fastest.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>2.18pm: </strong>I've had a quick scout around for the latest hockey tables but can't seem to find them, although I remember that Great Britain essentially need to win all their remaining games to have a chance of going through to the medal play-offs. It's 0-0 with 21 minutes left in the first half.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>2.21pm:</strong> Lu Yong wins China's eighth weightlifting gold medal, and the world record to boot. Andrei Rybakou, of Belarus lifted the same weight in the men's 85-kg class, which was a world record, but Lu weighs less and so took the gold.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>2.27pm: </strong>Excellent goal for Great Britain in the hockey, courtesy of James Tindall. A South African player totally missed an attempted interception of a pass in the middle of the pitch and Tindall was clean through on goal. The keeper advanced, but Tindall casually lifted it over him and into the net. Team GB lead 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>2.36pm:</strong> Quick round-up: Team GB's <strong>Paul Goodison</strong> is joint leader in the men's <strong>laser</strong> (that's sailing, by the way.) He won race four, and the current top three are: 1. Paul Goodison (Britain) 33, 2. Rasmus Myrgren (Sweden) 33, 3. Igor Lisovenko (Russia) 37. <strong>Penny Clark</strong> wasn't quite so good in the women's race and finished 10th in the fourth radial. Japan lead China 1-0 in the first-half of the women's <strong>football</strong> semi-final, where the winners play Brazil. Jelena Jankovic is 4-2 down to Dinara Safina in the <strong>tennis</strong> semi-final. The British women's 100m medley team are into the final, qualifying second fastest behind the Australians, as are the men, who qualified fifth fastest, behind, well, just behind.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>2.38pm: </strong>The 200m is the final event today in the heptathlon, and Kelly Sotherton, lying fifth overall, is in lane three in heat two. She'll be off momentarily.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>2.40pm</strong> Excellent run for Sotherton, who finishes second in her heat in a time of 23.39, which is her personal best. That means 1,040 points, but what that means to the overall standings remains to be seen. Sotherton had a decent day on the track, but blew it in the high jump and shot put. \"I'm gutted,\" said Sotherton, using the buzz word of Team GB! GB! GB! today.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>2.44pm:</strong> Natalia Dobrynska, of Ukraine, wins her heat of the heptathlon 200m and does so wearing a \"leader\" badge, a new innovation here that is kind of like the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. GB's Julie Hollman is back in seventh or eighth. Full standings at the end of the first day to follow.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>2.47pm:</strong> Britain's top discus thrower, Philippa Roles, just misses out on a place in the final. She wangs it 57.44m, but it's not far enough and she ends 16th. The men's shot put final is underway, at the same time as the final heat of the 200m of the heptathlon. After that, we should have the overall standings that will show us where Sotherton is.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>2.53pm:</strong> Dinara Safina has just successfully served for the match against Jelena Jankovic and goes through to the semi-final. Contrary to previous reports, that was the quarter-final and she'll now play China's Li Na in the semi. There are three Russians already in the semis, but Jankovic, the world No1 is out.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>2.54pm:</strong> Tom Bryant is coming in for the coming ten minutes or so, and I'll leave you with news that Kelly Sotherton is up to third in the heptathlon rankings at the end of the first day. Hyleas Fountain leads with 4060, Natalia Dobrynska is second with 3996 and Sotherton third with 3938, but probably won't be happy after a couple of poor events. Anyway, here's Tom.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> The men are still doing their thing with their sticks in the hockey and they're still 1-0 up against the South Africans, so jolly good for them. On the track, meanwhile, they're lining up for the men's 400m hurdles heat - which has always struck me as a particularly tricky race to run.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>3.04pm:</strong> The favourite Bershawn Jackson wins it in 49.20 but, even better is the bloke who comes in last. Not sure who he is yet but he came in what must have felt like three days behind the winner. Brilliant stuff, that's what all that training was for. Ah - it was Harouna Garba from Nigeria. See ya!</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>3.08pm:</strong> Over in the shot put, it looks like a ZZ Top roadie's convention as a succession of bearded, muscle-bound men compete in what I'd argue is one of the more bizarre track and field events. I can see the point, in an evolutionary sense, of virtually everything else - the javelin was useful for hunting, the running useful for chasing or being chased, the long-jump useful for jumping over things etc. However the point of hurling a large ball as fas as possible? It eludes me. Same for the discus, obviously.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>3.11pm:</strong>Just past halftime in the big women's football semi-final grudge match* between China and Japan, the Japanese are winning 1-0. Currently there are a lot of people lying flat on their backs looking winded. </p> <p><em>* May not actually be a grudge match, reporter groundlessly basing comments on the fact that the two countries are quite close to each other and very little else.</em></p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>3.13pm:</strong> And with after fact-less reporting, I'll let Howard take back over.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong>: \"We are up here TV-less and PC-less, and the New York Times site says Germany has eight golds so far (with no detail), while the Guardian site sticks to 7. Which is right?\" pleads Amy Hordes. Well, last week the NY Times apparently printed a correction from an article written in the mid 1960s, and are the noted arbiters of journalistic accuracy worldwide. I previously not only quoted from Wikipedia, but actually <em>mis</em>applied that baseless \"fact\". You take a guess.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> Somewhere at the Greatest Show on Earth, Rafael Nadal, arguably the greatest athlete in the world at the moment (Usain Bolt possibly excepted) is playing Novak Djokovic, arguably the greatest Serbian tennis player/impressionist combo in the world. But I can't find any evidence of it on the gogglebox on even the various internet streams, so can't really tell you anything about it. But The Polish ZZ Top roadie has won the shot put, it seems.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>3.24pm:</strong> Roger Cook has the investigative nose of his journalistic namesake: \"If Amy Hordes is TV-less and PC-less, how does she know what the NYT site says (or the Guardian for that matter) and how is she emailing you?\" Good questions, and I'll send the intern to the telex machine straight away to pick up her answer. That Polish shot putter is named Tomasz Majewsky, by the way, and he's taken gold ahead of the American Christian Cantwell.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>3.29pm: </strong>Great Britain have beaten South Africa 2-0 in the men's hockey and stay in with a chance of qualification for the medal matches. It's a fairly big ask - they'll have to beat Australia - but Matt Daley's late goal, added to James Tindall's first-half strike, give them a crucial victory in this match.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>3.32pm: </strong>You leave Tom Bryant in charge of a MBM for ten minutes and he starts a diplomatic incident. Regarding his \"throwaway\" comment that the China-Japan football match might be a grudge match, we have opened up a huge can of military worms: \"Yes, China v Japan most certainly is a grudge match, given added spice by the fact that today is the anniversary of Japan's defeat in WWII,\" explains John Senior. \"The Chinese, as usual, are playing what might be politely described as a robust physical game. Hopefully their fans won't follow suit and pelt the Japanese embassy with eggs and stones, like at the Asian Cup a few years ago.\"</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> The line-up for the semi-finals of the men's 400m hurdles have been decided and there are no members of Team GB! GB! GB! in them, so we can happily pretend the event doesn't exist. \"Yep, grudge match seems fair given Manchuria, Nanking, Japan's continued inability to apologise for war crimes and Chinese support for North Korea and its missile testing in the area,\" intones Anthony O'Keefe.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>3.39pm:</strong> Ker-rash goes my computer. \"I'm watching the tennis live on Malaysian TV in Kuala Lumpur,\" writess Simon Price. \"Nadal has just broken forthree two in the first set.\" Ta.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>3.46pm:</strong> Simon Price's email footer claims he's an executive director of a building communications company in Kuala Lumpur. But today he's moonlighting as a MBM correspondent, watching the tennis: \"Djokovic double faults to go 5:2 down. Nadal serving for the first set. He's killing him.\"</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>3.47pm</strong> Meanwhile, John Senior is watching the football, so I don't have to: \"Excellent second goal by Japan. A neat one-two through a crowd on the edge of the box left several Chinese defenders sprawled in a heap as<br>the ball was slotted past the keeper. They'll be boarding up the<br>windows at the Japanese embassy in Beijing about now, I should think.\" A joke too. I never realised how easy this could be. Anyone watching the weightlifting?</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>3.48pm:</strong> Joe Milton is concerned for our well-being: \"Are you continuing the MBM over the weekend?\" he asks. \"If so are feeling slightly bitter about it being that hardly anyone will be at work and therefore will be watching on TV or using websites instead of following your commentary?\" Yep, there'll still be full text commentary - in for a penny, etc. But on your second point, you'd be amazed. There are some folk who read this <em>while</em> they're also watching it on TV. Lord knows why, but it's true. Anyway, the women's 10,000m final is underway in the Bird's Nest.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>3.52pm: </strong>And finally the tennis appears on my screen, so Simon Price, you can now go to bed if you want to. Djokovic broke back against Nadal, but the Spaniard is still serving for the set at 5-4.</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>3.55pm</strong> This straight from the news-wires: Women's doubles Final: 1 DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), 2 Jungeun Ha &amp; Minjung Kim &amp; Hyojung Lee &amp; Kyungwon Lee (Kor), 3 DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), 4 Miyuki Maeda &amp; Kumiko Ogura &amp; Reiko Shiota &amp; Satoko Suetsuna (Jpn), Tania Luiz &amp; Eugenia Tanaka (Aus), DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), Wen-Hsing Cheng &amp; Yu-Chin Chien (Tpe), Kamilla Rytter Juhl &amp; Lena Frier Kristiansen (Den), Gail Emms &amp; Donna Kellogg (Gbr), Liliyana &amp; Vita Marissa (Ina), Miyuki Maeda &amp; Kumiko Ogura &amp; Reiko Shiota &amp; Satoko Suetsuna (Jpn), Jungeun Ha &amp; Minjung Kim &amp; Hyojung Lee &amp; Kyungwon Lee (Kor), Eei Hui Chin &amp; Pei Tty Wong (Mal), Chantal Botts &amp; Michelle Edwards (Rsa), Yanmei Jiang &amp; Yujia Li (Sin), Eva Lee &amp; Mesinee Mangkalakiri (USA)</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>3.56pm</strong> Nadal wins the first set 6-4. That garbled stuff below was my attempt to find out who won the women's doubles badminton, and I think this says it better: DU &amp; Yu (Chn) bt Lee &amp; Lee (Kor) 2-0; (21-15), (21-13) , so that's another gold for the home nation.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>3.59pm:</strong> \"There's a 'Racket of God' controversy brewing in the tennis,\" says Kevin Davies, and he's right, although he's maybe overstating it. \"Near the end of the Blake-Gonzalez match, NBC showed Blake losing a critical point after his shot fell out. It clearly grazed Gonzalez' racket, but the Chilean didn't acknowledge the touch. Blake tried showing restraint but bemoaned lack of Olympic spirit in the press conference.\" The TV commentators are on about this as well at the moment. Apparently Gonzalez should have called the foul on himself, but didn't, and Blake didn't win another game after the incident. This should give the noted moodster Blake something to whinge about for the coming few months.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>4.02pm:</strong> They're 14 minutes into the women's 10,000m, and GB's Jo Pavey is in about 16th place and \"running very wisely\" according to Brendon Foster. Holland's Lornah Kiplagat is out front.</p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>4.09pm:</strong> Kiplagat still leads with 11 laps to go, with Mestawet Tufa, of Ethiopia, second. Jo Pavey is beginning to struggle, especially compared with the casualness of the leaders. Pavey is out of the leading group now and is going to find it hard to get back into this.</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>4.12pm: </strong>Elvan Abeylegesse, of Turkey, is the new, mightily inconvenient leader for anyone typing this up. Tirunesh Dibaba, from Ethiopia, is second and Britain's Jo Pavey has fallen off the back of the earth.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>4.16pm:</strong> Abeylegesse still leads a strung-out group five, from Dibaba. Dibaba remains an Ethiopian, the nation that Abeylegasse left for Turkey. And it's definitely just between these two now as they move well clear of the rest of the field. Jo Pavey has now slipped off of even Brendan Foster's radar.</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>4.20pm: </strong>Novak Djokovic has broken Nadal in the second set of the men's semi-finals and leads 3-1. Abeylgesse and Dibaba are still going this alone, with both looking totally at ease, but Dibaba sitting threateningly on Abeylgesse's shoulder. Shalane Flanagan has moved into third spot for the United States.</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>4.22pm:</strong> <em>That's</em> how you win a <strong>10,000m </strong>race. At the bell, <strong>Tirunesh Dibaba</strong> explodes past Abeylgesse and flies into the lead. She sprints for the final 400m at a phenomenal rate and no one can get close. Abeylgesse keeps second and Flanagan takes third for the United States. \"That's not the result she would have wanted,\" says Steve Cram in the commentary box, as Jo Pavey comes in 412th from a field of 32. Dibaba's time was 29:54.68, which is one of the fastest times ever, despite smog, heat, etc., and so forth.</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>4.26pm:</strong> Novak Djokovic leads 4-1 in the second set, but is one set down to Rafael Nadal. I'm busily trying to find someone to take over this to see you to the end of the tennis.</p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>4.28pm:</strong> With a repeated punch to his own chest, Novak Djokovic breaks Nadal again to lead 5-1 in the second set. Looks like this one's going to a decider. Meanwhile, Jo Pavey asks \"What can you do?\" in her post-race interview and Kate Reed, whose was running in her first ever 10,000m final and didn't even appear in the commentary until it was done, also has a brief, sweaty chat. Not the results the British athletes will have been looking for, but a decent race nonetheless.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>4.33pm: </strong>OK, Pavey actually finished in 12th spot and Kate Reed 23rd. Djokovic levels the tennis and that goes to a decider, while Caroline Kluft doesn't qualify for the triple jump final. That's it from me. I'm off, but a full report from the tennis will follow. Full coverage continues over the weekend. Thanks for your emails. Bye.</p>"
