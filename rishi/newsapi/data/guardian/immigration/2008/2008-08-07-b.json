  "<h2>Britain makes spouses promise to learn </h2> <p>The British government has shelved plans to force spouses to learn English before they join their partners in Britain. </p> <p>Instead, spouses will be required to sign up to an agreement to learn the language before they leave their home country with checks made on their progress \"soon after arrival\".</p> <p>If spouses were found not to be fulfilling their promise to learn they could have their visas revoked, the Home Office said in an announcement last month.</p> <p>The climbdown by ministers comes after a public consultation exercise overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to require spouses to learn basic English before they were given visas to join husbands or wives.</p> <p>Immigration minister Liam Byrne said the introduction of English tests before spouses moved to the UK would be a \"medium-term goal\". </p> <p>But he claimed it would be impractical to demand tests before arrival because English lessons are not widely enough available overseas. </p> <p>Byrne said: \"British citizens have the right to marry whoever they choose. But we want newcomers to succeed in our society and sign up to the standards we have in common. That means freedom, not being forced to marry someone, and it means newcomers quickly acquiring a command of English, with consequences for those who break the rules.\"</p> <h2>Appeal against Poland's U-turn on English for all</h2> <p>Polish intellectuals, politicians, artists and celebrities have put their names to an open letter appealing to their prime minister, Donald Tusk, to reinstate a policy to teach English from the first year of primary school.</p> <p>The letter was prompted by the government's surprise decision to go back on its plan to introduce English language teaching in all schools from September.</p> <p>One of the signatories, Polish MEP Konrad Szymanski, told Polskie Radio: \"Compulsory English education in elementary schools is the best way to popularise this language. If Poland wants to be involved in the mainstream, common knowledge of English is a basic factor.\"</p> <p>The radio station quoted former president Lech Walesa as saying: \"I had no chance to learn English and I still feel hampered by it.\"</p> <p>Instead of making English compulsory, the education ministry now wants schools to choose which modern languages to teach.</p> <p>The ministry argues that in some regions of the country Russian or German would be more useful than English.</p> <h2>Crowded classes curb Saudi scholarships</h2> <p>Saudi Arabia is reported to be suspending scholarships for its students to study at foreign universities because too many of them are enrolled together in English language preparation classes, raising concerns about the quality of their training.</p> <p>The Saudi ministry of education limits the number of its scholarship students allowed to enrol at a single institution to 1% of the total student body. According to the Australian newspaper, 31 universities worldwide have now exceeded that limit, including five in Australia.</p> <p>Australia's allocation of Saudi scholarship students for 2008 was set at 1,100, but 1,700 students have been enrolled. In 2007 there were 2,299 Saudi students in English preparation programmes, an increase of 120% on 2006.</p> <h2>Japan's Nova boss faces charges over unpaid wages</h2> <p>Prosecutors in Osaka, Japan, received formal charges last month against failed English language school operator Nova Corp and its former president, Nozomu Sahashi, on suspicion of violating labour standards laws for failing to pay wages to Nova workers. </p> <p>Sahashi is suspected of failing to pay $1m in wages to 400 Nova workers. Among them were 266 foreign instructors whose unpaid wages in October last year totalled $673,000.</p> <p>Sahashi has claimed his failure to pay wages was not a violation of the law. \"I feel responsible as the [former] president of the company, but I did what I could do, like putting my own money into the business,\" he told labour officials.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"mailto:max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com\">max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336340023\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The most lavish Olympic games of the modern era will get under way today in the spectacular Bird's Nest stadium, with more than 80 heads of state joining 91,000 spectators and 15,000 performers for an opening ceremony expected to attract a global television audience of more than 3bn people.</p> <p>Despite concerns over pollution, security and human rights, the organisers are promising a 16-day extravaganza of sport; their spokesman, Sun Weide, said: \"Of course, we hope that these will be a great games, even the greatest.\"</p> <p>It will certainly start with a bang as 35,000 fireworks illuminate the five-hour ceremony. The identity of the athlete who will light the torch has not been announced and the method that will be used to elevate the Olympic flame from the track to the cauldron suspended 350 feet above on the roof of the stadium remains shrouded in secrecy. </p> <p>Billions of dollars and seven years of planning have gone into preparing the city for these games, and last night the sense of expectation was palpable. The boundaries of the Olympic Green, the main sports thoroughfare, were thronged with sightseers drawn to the spectacular illuminations of the stadium and the Water Cube aquatic centre, pulsing a deep blue as night fell.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the organisers will be hoping for a change in the weather to disperse the smog that tends to hang over the national stadium. Beijing's air pollution index yesterday was recorded at 96 , which came close to exceeding the national level for acceptable air. Today's forecast is for overcast skies with a slight chance of showers in the afternoon; greater relief may come at the weekend, with a forecast of moderate rain that could help wash out pollutants.</p> <p>Another cloud on the horizon is the issue of drugs. Although there have been no positive tests out of more than 600 carried out in the past two weeks, John Fahey, the president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, warned yesterday that sport could not risk another big drugs scandal. \"If we don't [tackle doping], part of the world will leave us because the public will desert any sport, any time, if they are not satisfied it has integrity,\" he said.</p> <p>The significance of this moment for China and its relations with the rest of the world is clear from the most high-profile guestlist the Olympic movement has ever seen. For the Beijing regime, the opening ceremony is a political event as important as the sporting spectacular, and yesterday the country's president, Hu Jintao, held audiences with a dozen state leaders and royal family members. George Bush heads a list that includes the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, Israel's president, Shimon Peres, and his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy.</p> <p>Of the main developed nations, only Britain and Germany are not represented by their most senior politician, though Gordon Brown will attend the closing ceremony. His predecessor, Tony Blair, will be there, however, as will the Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, and sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe. </p> <p>London's mayor, Boris Johnson, is staying away until the end of the games when he will receive the Olympic flag from the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge. Ken Livingstone, the man he beat in June's election, is in Beijing as a guest of the city authorities.</p> <p>Those in attendance will witness an athletes' parade that has been touched by politics and will reflect the diplomatic tensions between the US and China that surfaced this week. A day after China revoked the visa of the 2002 speed-skating gold medallist Joey Cheek for fear that he would speak out against Beijing's support for the Sudanese regime accused of sponsoring genocide in Darfur, the US team announced that Lopez Lomong, a refugee from Sudan, would carry the stars and stripes at the head of the team.</p> <p>Rogge also announced yesterday that the North and South Korean teams will not be marching together as they did in Athens and Sydney. Instead, they will march in one after the other, with North Korea coming first, courtesy of the Mandarin alphabet used to decide the order. </p> <p>Rogge said he was convinced the games would be a positive step for China and its engagement with the rest of the world. \"The excitement I feel and the IOC feels is that of an athlete before a major competition,\" he said.</p> <p>\"As for the significance of these games, each games is important for the Olympic movement, and each has its own identity. Clearly in Greece the games was going back to its roots, to its birthplace in the home of classicism. China will be opening up the games to one fifth of mankind, and the next games in London will be in the country that invented modern sport and gave athleticism to the world.</p> <p>\"I think this will mean a lot for the perception of China. On the one hand for the rest of the world to discover China will be to discover a country that is for most of the world a bit mysterious. But they will find a country with 5,000 years of history, a fascinating country. I believe the spotlight on China will help the world to understand China, and it will also help China to understand the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>Utter the name Joyce McKinney to Britons of a certain age, and you are inevitably rewarded with the briefest flash of incomprehension, followed by a gasp as their memories take them tumbling back to the dark days of early autumn, 1977.</p> <p>It was a miserable time: there were clashes on the picket line at Grunwick, inflation was sprinting away at 13%, Elvis had just died and a band called Baccara were at Number One with Yes Sir, I Can Boogie. And then, as if to lift the spirits of a nation, along came the most unlikely, the most baffling, the most downright weird news story.</p> <p>A Mormon missionary from Utah called Kirk Anderson, who was going door-to-door in Ewell, Surrey, was kidnapped at gunpoint by McKinney, a former cheerleader and beauty queen from North Carolina. With the help of a friend, Keith May, McKinney drugged Anderson with chloroform and drove him to a rented 17th century cottage near Okehampton, Devon. There the unfortunate young man was chained, spreadeagled, to a bed, with several pairs of mink-lined handcuffs, and over the next few days he was repeatedly required to have sex with McKinney, who later explained that she had been keen to bear his child.</p> <p>Eventually the missionary wriggled free, dashed from the cottage and alerted police, who set up roadblocks around Okehampton, capturing both beauty queen and friend. The pair were charged with false imprisonment and possession of an imitation .38 revolver, and brought before Epsom magistrates. </p> <p>McKinney explained at the commital proceedings that she had fallen head over heels for Anderson when they were at college together in Utah, adding: \"I loved him so much that I would ski naked down Mount Everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to.\" She had hired a private detective, tracked Anderson down and came to Britain with May.</p> <h2>Tabloid dream</h2> <p>It was a tabloid dream. Mormon Sex Slave Case, screeched the Daily Mail. McKinney and the Manacled Mormon, yelled the Mirror. Even the Guardian got in on the act with the only-slightly more coy: Missionary was \"shackled for sex\". McKinney's counsel told the magistrates that \"methinks the Mormon do protest too much\".</p> <p>McKinney was remanded in custody at Holloway prison, north London, pending the full trial but released on bail three months later because of her failing mental health. May was also bailed and at this point they fled to Canada disguised asmime artists.</p> <p>And that, perhaps, should have been the end of the matter.</p> <p>But then last Tuesday, courtesy of the Associated Press news agency, came the delightful story of one \"Bernann\" McKinney, whose pet dog Booger the pit bull terrier had been successfully cloned by a team of South Korean scientists. </p> <p>Announcing that she planned to give her identical pets the names Booger McKinney, Booger Lee, Booger Ra, Booger Hong and Booger Park, in honour of the team at Seoul National University that carried out the work, a delighted McKinney could be seen beaming from several news websites and newspapers, including the Guardian. And some of a certain age beamed back, thinking: \"Ohmygawd!\"</p> <p>A simple check of public records in North Carolina yesterday confirmed that Joyce and \"Bernann\" are, indeed, one and the same person, and that the predatory beauty queen of 1977 has matured into the pit bull-loving 57-year-old of 2008.</p> <p>The years have not been particularly kind to McKinney. She has put on a little weight (haven't we all?) and has used a wheelchair for more than a decade. After crossing the border from Canada she travelled to Atlanta, Georgia, where she went into hiding, disguised as a nun, according to some accounts. Then she returned to the tiny town of Minneapolis on the North Carolina-Tennessee border, where her parents had been schoolteachers, and moved on to her late grandparents' wooden farmhouse.</p> <p>There were to be a few more scrapes with the law. In 1984 she was arrested after Anderson spotted her loitering near his place of work in Salt Lake City. When the police searched the boot of her car they found a length of rope and a pair of handcuffs, but charges against her were dropped after she once again jumped bail.</p> <p>In 1993 she broke into a dog pound in Johnson City, Tennessee, to rescue a pit bull terrier that was about to be put down for mauling a couple of joggers. This raises the possibility that the Booger brothers, so skillfully cloned in Seoul, are exact replicas of a dog that once faced the death penalty because of its attacks on humans. But, as McKinney explained after the break-in: \"I love those pit bulls. They're such sympathetic animals - they're my kind of dog.\"</p> <h2>Lawless</h2> <p>Minneapolis is in the heart of the southern Appalachians, the tough and somewhat lawless mountainous region that was the setting for the Burt Reynolds film Deliverance. Even here, however, some men say they are wary of her, and caution visitors not to stray on to her land, warning that they could be attacked by her pit bulls.</p> <p>Anderson himself married after returning to Utah, and found work as a travel agent in the small town of Orem.</p> <p>And by and large, McKinney has also led a blameless life over the past three decades. She could not be contacted for comment yesterday, but when a British reporter tracked her down and spoke to her nine years ago she said: \"Now everybody understands, and they know what it means to have the paparazzi chasing around after you. I cried all night when Diana died. I may be just an ol' farm girl, but I've hit that wall with her. Everywhere I go, people will always remember me as a woman who did the unthinkable. Just try to imagine what that feels like.\"</p> <p>In theory, however, McKinney remains a fugitive from British justice, and after breaking her cover to hail the success of the scientists in Soeul, could face extradition to stand trial back at Epsom. </p> <p>Is this possible? We asked Scotland Yard. The young woman - clearly too young - who answered the call, listened patiently for a few minutes. \"I'm sorry,\" she said finally. \"I haven't a clue what you're talking about.\"</p>",
  "<p>The \"guilt\" in guilty pleasures doesn't seem to translate to the rest of Europe. Gothenburg duo pacific! unapologetically embrace the kind of corny, triumphal synthesiser sounds that British bands can only revive while dressing like Crockett and Tubbs and making jokes about DeLoreans. This is a guileless fantasy of California, where Beach Boys harmonies meet high-gloss MOR like sunlight bouncing off a convertible's bonnet. Indeed, Number One is exactly how Brian Wilson and co would have sounded had they greeted the mid-80s with a full-blown synth-pop album. All this doe-eyed sweetness is enough to give you an ice-cream headache, but few singles this year evince as much pure, awestruck joy as Sunset Blvd, church bells and all.</p>",
  "<p>The sweat runs along Bradley Wiggins's back in thick rivulets and splashes on the wooden floor beneath his stationary bike. Close by him a middle-aged Chinese woman with a mop is hovering, ready to clear up the puddles that are gathering under the rider as he spins the pedals, holding his aerodynamic tuck but going nowhere, his rear wheel turning on a roller set up in the middle of the Laoshan velodrome. The bike shudders and the puddle spreads as he pounds on and on, observed from a distance by a gaggle of coaches. Welcome to the medals factory.</p> <p>With barely 24 hours to go before the opening ceremony of the 29th Olympic Games, the biggest in history, the newly shorn Wiggins and a dozen other members of the track cycling team - Victoria Pendleton, Chris Hoy, Rebecca Romero and the rest - are running through a micro-managed two-hour training session in the hall on Beijing's western outskirts where they will attempt to bring four years of preparation to a triumphant climax. Of Britain's 312-strong team, this squad is the one in which the greatest optimism is invested. All they need to do is maintain the momentum that brought nine gold medals at the world championships in Manchester last March for their exploits to provide a template of organisation and motivation to be followed by the rest of British sport in the long run-up to London 2012.</p> <p>But the events in the velodrome are still a week away. Before then the road cyclist Nicole Cooke, the shooter Richard Faulds, the gymnast Beth Tweddle and the 14-year-old diver Tom Daley - already so famous that he was signing autographs for Chinese fans watching training yesterday - are among those with the chance to get the team off to a medal-winning start. The events of four years ago, however, prove that a slow opening to the campaign need not create a mood of despondency.</p> <p>In Athens the early progress of the British team was so faltering that, only four days into the Games, the tabloids were calling for them to be brought home - not quite in chains but almost - before they could inflict further humiliation upon themselves. Cyclists, judokas, marksmen and horsewomen alike had failed to live up to expectations. In the pool the fancied swimmers and divers were floundering. A chastened Tim Henman had been to see Simon Clegg, Team GB's chef de mission, to apologise for losing his first-round singles match in straight sets. </p> <p>The team stayed on, of course. Although an aghast nation was forced to watch as Paula Radcliffe stumbled helplessly to a tearful halt before the end of the marathon, the derision subsided as the rest gradually turned their fortunes around. Hoy, Wiggins, the three-day eventer Leslie Law, the yachtsman Ben Ainslie, the three blondes in a boat and the men's coxless four laid the golden foundation, and an athletics team that seemed about to betray their heritage by drawing a complete blank suddenly redeemed themselves with an unprecedented 800-1500m double for Kelly Holmes and a storming win for the men's 4x100 squad. A total of 30 medals - nine gold, nine silver and 12 bronze - represented Britain's second best total of all time, beaten only in Los Angeles in 1984, the year of the eastern bloc boycott.</p> <p>Yesterday's withdrawal of the boxer Frankie Gavin will have modified the target set by UK Sport of 35 medals overall, including 12 golds - enough, in its calculations, to get the team into a projected eighth place in the overall table.</p> <p>There is no Holmes this time, the reshaped men's sprint relay team is hardly the force it was and a series of injuries and accidents is casting a shadow over Radcliffe's participation. The track and field, too, may again look a barren prospect, only the triple jumper Phillips Idowu, the heptathlete Kelly Sotherton and Christine Ohuruogu and Nicola Sanders in the 400m looking like serious contenders for gold.</p> <p>Yet there are still more than enough reasons to anticipate that general enjoyment will be spiced with the possibility of British success: Ainslie, Cooke, Daley, Faulds, Tweddle, the taekwondoists Sarah Stevenson and Aaron Cook, the trio of women in the Yngling boat, the archer Alan Wills, the women's quad sculls and the men's lightweight double sculls, the triathletes Tim Don, Will Clarke and Helen Tucket, the badminton pair Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson, the horseman William Fox-Pitt, the canoeists Campbell Walsh and Tim Brabants, the modern pentathletes Heather Fell and Katy Livingston, the judoka Karina Bryant, and the swimmers Rebecca Adlington in the 800m freestyle and David Davies in the brand-new 10km open-water race. And there may, of course, be the odd pleasant surprise.</p> <p>But the Games also have a tradition of bringing us closer to sportsmen and women with whom we share no affiliations of ethnicity or nationhood. The deeds of men and women with names such as Nurmi, Blankers-Koen, Zatopek, Clay, Bikila, Beamon, Fosbury, Spitz, Comaneci, Lewis, Bubka, Egerszegi and Fu Minxia bring us all closer together as we share glimpses of the extent of human potential. Zatopek's triple of 5000m, 10,000, and marathon in Helsinki in 1952, Beamon's leap of 8.90m in Mexico in 1968 and Comaneci's perfect 10 on the asymmetrical bars in Montreal in 1976 were superhuman feats but they would not have carried half the resonance had they been achieved in any other context.</p> <p>Usain Bolt of Jamaica in the 100m and 200m sprints, Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia in the pole vault and Michael Phelps of the US, aiming at a record eight golds in the pool, are among those most likely to transfix viewers around the world. Were Radcliffe to fight her way to redemption, the headlines would be ready-made.</p> <p>But it is hard to turn away from Britain's track cyclists. As the hyper-intense Romero makes her turbo-roller whine like a departing 747, the muscular Hoy practises explosive starts with the other members of the sprint squad, and the team pursuit quartet glide around the steeply banked Siberian pine track, switching positions at top speed with millimetre-perfect accuracy, the measure of the champion athlete's obsession comes into focus, and makes perfect sense.</p> <p>Tonight, in front of 91,000 spectators and many millions around the world, China's coming-out party will start with a ceremony that promises to be long, loud and relentlessly spectacular. But the real truth was to be found yesterday in the pool of sweat gathering beneath a man going nowhere on the way to complete fulfilment.</p>",
  "<p>Europe prides itself on being a continent of human rights, freedom and international solidarity. Yet it is fighting an increasingly dirty war against immigration, with casualties mounting every day. The biggest victims are the poor and the vulnerable, who are demonised as \"illegal\" or \"bogus\". But EU governments are also doing huge harm to the societies they purportedly want to protect.</p> <p>Britain continues to hunt down unauthorised migrants and is planning to introduce ID cards for foreigners. In Italy, Gypsy camps have been burned down, and the Berlusconi government, far from protecting the targets of such racist attacks, is whipping up animosity against them and fingerprinting them. Spain is increasing its efforts to stop desperate Africans from reaching European soil, causing thousands to die each year as they take longer and more dangerous routes to avoid detection. Last month 15 people died of dehydration and exposure when their boat engine failed as they tried to reach Almer\u00eda, on the Costa del Sol. The previous week 14 people drowned when their boat sank off nearby Motril.</p> <p>Those lucky enough to escape death en route to Europe now face being locked up when they arrive. The EU's new \"return directive\", which was recently approved by European interior ministers and MEPs, allows governments to imprison - sorry, detain - unauthorised migrants for up to 18 months. Why? For daring to cross a border in search of a better life. </p> <p>As the EU begins to adopt a common approach to immigration, the British government is helping to draft Europe-wide measures that attract little coverage in the UK. Frontex, the EU's border force, is helping southern European governments to patrol the Mediterranean and around the Canaries. And while the return directive was front-page news in Spain, it was a footnote in Britain. </p> <p>There is plenty more to come. Nicolas Sarkozy, the son of a Hungarian migrant, has made cracking down on migration a priority for France's EU presidency, which lasts until the end of this year. His proposed migration pact aims to make it easier for the EU to attract highly qualified migrants, establish common European refugee and asylum policies by 2010, beef up policing of the EU's borders, and expel more illegal migrants. EU leaders are due to decide on the plans in October.</p> <p>They should reject them. Europe's clampdown on immigration is neither fair nor sensible. Undocumented migrants are not criminals, nor are they an invading army. They are human beings less fortunate than ourselves. Most come to do jobs that comfortable Europeans no longer want to do, but as Europe's front doors are closed, they have to creep in through the back. Far from threatening Europe's ageing societies, they are reinvigorating them. What's more, the billions of pounds they send home dwarfs the sums that European governments give in aid. </p> <p>The cruel irony is that, despite all the suffering they cause, Europe's increasingly costly border controls fail to keep foreigners out. Instead, they foster people-smuggling and an ever-expanding shadow economy in which illegal migrants are vulnerable to exploitation, labour laws are broken and taxes go unpaid. They also encourage people who would rather work temporarily to remain permanently, because migrants fear that if they go home they will not be able to return to Europe. Surveys of Senegalese migrants in Italy show that most would prefer to spend part of their time working in Europe and part back home, just as the Poles who commute back and forth to Britain do. A sensible immigration policy would facilitate this.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Philippe Legrain is the author of Immigrants: Your Country Needs Them <br><a href=\"mailto:mail@philippelegrain.com\">mail@philippelegrain.com</a></p>",
  "<p>After almost two years in prison, New Yorker Tremayne Durham could stand it no longer. His craving for a decent bit of nosh was so intense that he agreed to pay a high price - a life sentence.</p> <p>Durham, 33, struck a plea bargain last month in which he was guaranteed a meal of KFC chicken, Popeye's chicken, mashed potato, coleslaw, carrot cake and ice cream - in return for pleading guilty to murder.</p> <p>As part of the deal, and after being handed a life sentence this week in court in Portland, Oregon, Durham will also get a second feast, with an Italian theme of calzone, lasagne, pizza and ice cream.</p> <p>The judge, Eric Bergstrom, is understood to have accepted the bargain because it would save the state of Oregon thousands of dollars in staging a trial and possible subsequent appeals.</p> <p>The murder happened in June 2006 as a revenge killing. </p> <p>Durham travelled from New York city across the country to confront an Oregon company from whom he had ordered a truck costing $18,000.

  "<p>China has invested an extraordinary amount of emotional capital in the opening of the Olympic games in Beijing today. This is China's moment of national glory. The legitimacy the government will reap from the games will be worth more to it than the $43bn they have cost so far. Even a critic of the government's human rights record like Ai Weiwei, the designer of the Bird's Nest stadium, writes today in the Guardian of his hopes for a new era of openness: \"For the past 30 years, we have dismantled barriers, opened doors and windows, been dazzled by sunshine and felt the wind of profound change. In the Olympics, we expect to witness new heights of effort and hope, speed and strength, that will inspire China to lift the pace of reform, to be more determined, more courageous and more at peace with ourselves.\" After a build-up like that, reality is bound to kick in, hard.</p> <p>There will be two different Olympic experiences on hand over the next 16 days - one for the 80 state leaders and royals attending the opening ceremony and the other for the Chinese themselves. A glimpse of the disdain shown for the people was the treatment given to the enthusiastic crowds who had assembled outside the red gates of the Temple of Heaven to see the arrival of the Olympic flame, an event intended to erase the memory of its conflict-strewn path around the world. The flame was paraded inside the gates, and those waiting outside were treated as if they were of no consequence.</p> <p>This is the least of it. Hundreds of thousands of migrant construction workers have been forced off the streets of the capital to the villages. The streets have been cleaned of all manner of undesirables - recyclers, beggars, sex workers and petitioners. The entire human rights and legal community has been locked down and activists thrown in prison. Hundreds of thousands of residents have been evicted and had their homes demolished. \"Undesirables\" have vanished off the streets of other Olympic cities before, but probably not on this scale. These people are paying a high price for the jamboree we will see on our television screens today.</p> <p>This is not to deny the gains that have been achieved over the past three decades. Each death sentence is now reviewed by the supreme people's court, and it is claimed that there has been a drop in the number of such sentences carried out, although figures are not released. Life as a believing Muslim or Christian is difficult, but easier than it was. There are many subjects off-limits for Chinese journalism, not least the party, Tibet and Falun Gong. But journalists are freer to investigate corruption and land disputes. All these are tangible and worthy gains.</p> <p>But they do not address the central point: to get the games, the host city made specific commitments on human rights and freedom of speech to the International Olympic Committee. Like the quality of the air the athletes are due to perform in, Beijing has come up short on the standards it set for itself. It should be kept to its word. The IOC has not covered itself in glory in enforcing the contract that was signed by the host city bid, which continues to be treated as a state secret. The grey, humid smog that hung over the city yesterday is a useful metaphor for the whole debate. The authorities said air quality was fairly good but, like the human rights issue, it is all a question of where you start from. The air is better than it has been, but nowhere near as clean as Beijing promised.</p> <p>The central clash of the games is billed as being between the Cuban world record holder Dayron Robles and China's most famous sportsman, Liu Xiang, in the 110m hurdles. Behind them will lie a contest of greater forces, the human rights agenda that Robles signed up to, and the national pride of the Chinese nation. It should not be like this, and if progress is to be achieved, there should be no such opposition. Inevitably, however, this will be known as the human rights games.</p>",
  "<p>The air was muggy, and a haze hung over Beijing as if it was yet to wake up, although it was midday. I had decided months before that I would be there for the opening ceremony of the Olympics, and share the excitement. But as I drove in from the airport there were no welcome banners, no colourful flags on the lampposts, no billboards or Olympic posters. It was only three weeks till the big day, after seven years of waiting and meticulous preparations. It was to be the \"dream of a century\" for the Chinese. But the atmosphere was dead. </p> <p>The fast lane of the airport expressway and all the ring roads were marked with the five circles of the Olympic symbol. No cars dared to enter them. The traffic moved unusually freely, as half the city's 3.2m cars have been taken off the road to reduce congestion and help clean up the air. There were few foreign tourists either; the air hostess told me on the way over that Air China flights were being cut back as visas had been drastically restricted to keep out potential troublemakers. I got home in record time.</p> <p>I was startled to see a police car parked outside my apartment complex, and two volunteers in blue and white torch-bearer T-shirts standing at the crossroads. The porter was in military khaki. Instead of greeting me as he usually did, he demanded proof of my residence. I asked him the reason for this change: \"Don't you feel safer?\" he asked. </p> <p>Later I popped out to get the local papers and magazines, and they were full of alarm, bombs in Kunming, suspicious white powder on a plane, anti-aircraft missiles being installed by the Bird's Nest stadium ready for any attack. There were to be security checks on the Beijing underground, and checkpoints at frequent intervals on the highways into the city. \"Even if they dare to commit any crime during the Olympics, they won't be able to escape easily,\" the Beijing Evening News said. Where was the joy, the sense of celebration?</p> <p>I had last been here in early March, just before the demonstrations in Tibet and the violence at the torch relay around the world. The mood was boisterous then, with eager anticipation as the giant clock ticked away on Tiananmen Square counting down to the start. \"Give us 16 days of Olympics, and be rewarded with 5,000 years of our civilisation,\" was a slogan I remembered well. The only questions were: would the stadium and various other sites be finished on time, what about the traffic jams, how could the visitors be made to feel at home, would Chinese athletes collect more golds than America? Above all, how could our Olympic games become the most successful, the most memorable in history?</p> <p>Now the Olympics are here, but the buzz has gone. The only tangible reminder of it has been the torch relay inside China, in which the rest of the world was scarcely interested. Even that was highly staged, with a very visible police and security presence. The commentators on China Central Television even told their audiences to sit at home and watch it on television. A subdued nervousness permeates Beijing.</p> <p>Critics say the Chinese government is exaggerating the terror risk to extend its control. But is it really necessary to have this high security, I asked a Chinese friend, who is not very patriotic. \"Yes,\" she said. \"It is all the foreign devils. Better to have a safe games than a farce like the torch relays in London, Paris, and San Francisco. It was such a loss of face. We don't want it here on our soil.\" </p> <p>For the government too, the risk seems real. They started with \"One World, One Dream\": they believed that China would be welcomed on to the world stage and galvanised frenetic popular support. When the western media protested at the award of the Olympics to China, the government felt it would overcome its critics by dazzling the world with its brilliant display. They failed to appreciate the importance the world would attach to the pledges they had given on the environment, human rights and press freedom. Surely diplomacy means engaging with the world on the world's terms, not just on your terms? </p> <p>Then the protests against the torch relay produced a sea change. Fear of disruption, or worse, hostage-taking and killings like Munich in 1972, took over. The government's new line was only confirmed when 16 policemen were killed in an attack in Xinjiang, in western China, on Monday, just four days before the opening ceremony. A government spokesman said the attackers wanted to \"make 2008 a year of mourning for China\". Now a headline in the Beijing Evening News said it all: \"A safe Olympics is the most important gold medal.\" At any cost, even the jubilation of the whole country. </p> <p>I came back to England. If watching the Olympics on television is now the choice of the Chinese, I thought I would rather do it in London. But then I was overwhelmed by the avalanche of criticism in the British press and TV coverage: \"'Police-state wastes goodwill', says stadium designer\"; \"Beijing Olympics: the spying games\", \"Clegg urges PM: don't endorse these tainted Olympics\", \"Queasy rider - US cyclists combat pollution\", \"Britons arrested for flying pro-Tibet banners\", \"Tiananmen orchestra cannot drown out the chorus of protests\" - and many, many more, ranging from abhorring the \"hideous\" Bird's Nest, to accusations of exploiting the migrant workers who built it. This is not fact-finding but fault-finding. And now, at the eleventh hour, Bush has rasped at China's record on human rights and religious freedom, fanning the flames. </p> <p>China certainly has faults. But reading the papers and watching the news, you might think the country has nothing to take credit for. Do a billion Chinese not deserve their day in the limelight, their moment of rejoicing? The western press seems to equate the Olympics with the Chinese government, not the people - and the people must wonder what they have to do to win some approval.</p> <p>As a Chinese writer and film-maker, I have tried to tell the truth about China - most recently spending a year in Tibet, documenting the lives of ordinary Tibetans, their dreams and their frustrations. I know the problems all too well. But as the writer VS Pritchett once said, the only worthwhile criticism is \"lit with a gleam of sympathy\". The reforms that have produced China's vibrant cities, its new prosperity and new freedoms, only started 30 years ago in 1978. We still have a long way to go. But covering China with nothing but shame is not going to help us get there. As we Chinese say, you don't make a seedling grow faster by pulling it up and stretching it. </p> <p>We can expect more demonstrations in Beijing during the games, especially with the kind of encouragement given by the western press. The Chinese government would do well not to overreact to the protests or the criticism, with 25,000 foreign journalists focusing on them. They should be confident in the knowledge that the majority of the Chinese are behind them, at least on the games. I'm sure it will be a great and memorable - and safe - spectacle. I will be watching it, and so will half the world. But I shall be wishing that my countrymen and women were dancing in the streets.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sun Shuyun is the author of A Year in Tibet, and directed the BBC4 series of the same title <br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"><br>comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Peter Preston's astute analysis of borderland Pakistan (Where writs don't run, August 4) omits to mention the high premium which the Pashtuns who live there place on education. Students at the university college where I work, 40 minutes from the Khyber Pass, are fluent in three languages, and the highest achievers opt for science, especially in medicine and engineering. One student, justifiably nicknamed Einstein by his classmates, learned his basic science at one of those allegedly dangerous madrasas along the Afghan border which the Americans believe to be fomenting terrorism.</p> <p>The \"truth\" about these tribal \"badlands\" between Pakistan and Afghanistan is about as far from the imagination of Washington (including Barack Obama) as were the exploits of John Wayne and his gun-toting friends from the reality of what once happened to America's indigenous population.<br><strong>David L Gosling</strong><br>Principal, Edwardes College, University of Peshawar, Pakistan </p> <p>There are two things to add to Simon Tisdall's briefing (Moving the Afghan war to Pakistan, August 5). On the northern side of the Peshawar-Khyber road there is mile after mile of shanty town, a refugee camp for Afghans originally established for Afghans fleeing the Soviet invasion.</p> <p>Among the population there is a new generation of frustrated, unemployed and bored men who are happy to step over the border to take the place of their fallen Taliban comrades. The supply of manpower is virtually inexhaustible.</p> <p>This leads to the second, largely unappreciated, fact of life among the Afghan refugee community and their cousins in Pakistan's unrulable \"tribal areas\": young men, unable to aspire to be doctors or teachers or footballers, hanker to follow the example of generations and become fighters or warriors.

  "<p>Beijing's final Foreign Language Activity Week took place in May. In the aftermath of the Sichuan earthquake, the activities were more sombre than the organisers had anticipated, but at the opening ceremony held in Chaoyang Park officials quietly declaimed their achievements. Five and a half million Beijingers could now speak a foreign language, up from just 3.2 million at the end of 2006, they said.</p> <p>The man behind it all is Liu Yang, the head of the Beijing Speaks Foreign Languages Committee, which was founded eight years ago and entrusted with the task of \"creating a good linguistic environment\" for the Olympic games.</p> <p>By the end of last year, the committee had organised six English language \"park celebrations\", 701 \"neighbourhood study spots\" and 433 \"English corners\" in which local students practised rote-learned phrases with one another. They staged foreign song contests, public speaking competitions and free tuition. </p> <p>The idea, said Liu, was to turn Beijing into the \"international city\" it was always supposed to be. Although the campaign was spurred on by the Olympic games, efforts would proceed well beyond 2008.</p> <p>The committee also helped to organise a foreign teacher recruitment drive. However, tough visa restrictions in the run-up to the games appear to have stifled those efforts. </p> <p>The Olympics won't create miracles, but enthusiasm is half the battle. The 17-day sporting extravaganza represents the culmination of three decades of Chinese efforts to reconnect with the world, and enthusiasm continues to run high. </p> <p>After the revolution of 1949, Esperanto was the ideal and Russian was positively encouraged, but English belonged to the imperialists. According to Bob Adamson, an expert with the Hong Kong Institute of Education, English was \"viewed by some national leaders as a useful tool for the development of the economy but a negative force culturally and politically.\"</p> <p>It was put back on the curriculum in the mid-50s, but students would be trained in a Pavlovian manner to recite slogans castigating US foreign policies and proclaiming the inevitable victory of the proletariat. Even Chairman Mao used to study English from the translations of President Liu Shaoqi's speeches. It was hardly the language of the Olympiad.</p> <p>Long before the Olympic torch was even a twinkle in the eye of China's leaders, learning English was already high on the agenda. The forces that have driven the country to the brink of its biggest international event in history have also driven its people to embrace English, the lingua franca of global culture and commerce. The education system, at least in the cities, has followed the economy along the capitalist road. </p> <p>But Liu has sought to target the sort of people who wouldn't know their Tefl from their elbow. Among them are the cabbies, who remain the most likely to find themselves in the company of foreigners during a 4km snarl-up on the Third Ring Road. </p> <p>Taxi driver Guo Jingsheng has already been given a special permit to wait outside Beijing's spanking new Olympic media centre to pick up any one of the several thousand bewildered foreign journalists here to report on the games.</p> <p>\"I can understand some English, but I respond pretty slowly,\" Guo said. \"I don't have much time to study. I think it is harder for Beijing people.\"</p> <p>At least as far as foreign languages are concerned, Beijing has fallen considerably behind the more cosmopolitan Shanghai. Although local polyglots were routinely arrested during the Cultural Revolution, Shanghai's attitude to foreign languages has rarely been hobbled by political prejudices. Its residents are more amenable to new phrasings: they have had to learn Mandarin on top of their own \u2014 rather distinct \u2014 local dialect.</p> <p>Beijing, on the other hand, is a city of monoglots. Even the Beijing accent \u2014 full of drawling elisions \u2014 seems to confound attempts to learn another tongue.</p> <p>It isn't that Guo hasn't been trying. His employer has been offering voluntary evening classes over the past year, and he has been attending when he can. </p> <p>\"They are not forcing us to do it. Most of us just want to do our bit and make some money. Learning English is a good thing to do anyway.\"</p> <p>Now in his 50s, Guo is a member of the lost generation. During the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, English classes were cancelled. In 1972, when they were begrudgingly reintroduced in the wake of Nixon's detente, Guo's textbooks would have been filled with passages about English being a tool of the class struggle.</p> <p>You still find people, in their late 50s, who know the English words for \"hammer\" and \"sickle\" but very little else. The former might finally have some use at one Olympic event. </p> <p>In recent weeks the press has been packed with stories about patriotic senior citizens, chefs and police officers learning their ABCs in the hope that they can do their bit for the games. Sixty-eight-year-old Auntie Ma told local reporters that learning English made her feel younger. Others said that they just wanted to help out. </p> <p>Liu is also a senior watchdog in the city's efforts to eliminate \"Chinglish\". The campaign has sought to remove anything that draws attention to the fact that Beijing is not really used to foreign company. The committee's website has avoided any potential embarrassment by remaining entirely in Chinese. </p> <p>Already the more notorious solecisms on menus, street signs and government leaflets \u2014 the staple of countless amused blogs and travelogs \u2014 have been replaced with standardised translations. There is still much work to do. In an online test, volunteers are asked to choose between \"staff only\" and \"client stop!\", and \"emergency exit\" and \"emergency out\". </p> <p>Chinglish, it seems, draws unwelcome attention to the sort of cultural rifts that the Olympic games were designed to smooth over. Foreigners will perhaps be disappointed by the elimination of gems like \"racist park\" or \"Careful Landslip Attention Security\". But above all else, Beijing wants to be taken seriously.</p>",
  "<p> Lurching wildly from must-have PS3 games to animal fighting duos, this week's Chatterbox staggered toward the taste barrier, took a quick peek, then belly flopped over. If it all got too much for you, here's a carefully edited replay... </p> <p>We start with Friday. Race Driver GRID comes up for discussion with several 'box regular's defending its easy sling-about handling. \"It's the sort of game you could only dream of when a kid. Looks amazing, and the damage is just quality, and it's real cars,\" says TonyHayers effectively summing up the game's appeal in 25 words.</p> <p>This is somehow supplanted by spit-roasting - fortunately, of the outdoor eating variety. \"I could probably manage a small piglet, but the missus wouldn't be too pleased,\" concludes Goody84 ambiguously. Newcomer Smiffington pops up to ask whether there are any must-have buys on PS3. General consensus? The likes of MGS, COD4, Uncharted, GTAIV and Warhawk are as close as you'll get.</p> <p>The Pes 2009 trailer appears to a ripple of interest (though not as much as the Barry George acquittal), but the afternoon drifts out on some useful best man speech advice (use visual aids, do a CV of the groom, keep it short...).</p> <p>A couple of keen readers sneak in on Saturday, with Roarrr raising a valid point about the PlayStation Store, \"Watched some more GTR R35 clips... if you log in via US PSN the clips are free but you cannot watch unless you have us wallet, but in EU they are 69p?? How can that be justified?\" How indeed. Roarrr also <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5031985/rage-and-ids-lovehate-relationship-with-the-ps3\">links</a> to Kotaku's story about John Carmack, who claims the Xbox 360 version of Rage will look inferior to the PS3 one due to DVD issues. His views are dissected and assessed with comparative objectivity; there's an understanding that neither Sony's nor Microsoft's consoles are perfect, the former due to the complexities of the Cell processor, the latter due to its aging innards.</p> <p>Monday kicks off with weekend gaming chatter and some DIY anecdotes (how the hell does a crowbar come into painting?). There's a general love/hate relationship developing with Battlefield Bad Company - love the destruction, hate the fact you can't see who's shooting at you. Then Carvalhosgonads trots by with this week's most unlikely conundum:</p> <blockquote> <br> <p>Something quite weird happened on sat, had a phone call from a completely random woman (misdialed), but had a brief chat just to be polite, she's been texting me ever since so I've replied .... just general chat stuff, she wants to meet up .... should I go or am I gonna get murdered?</p> </blockquote> <br> <p>A flurry of advice follows, none of it wiser than Milkncheese's compassionate and sensible counsel: \"Whilst there is a small chance that this woman will turn out to be the lady of your dreams, it's almost inevitable that you will actually wake up the following day in an ice filed bath minus your kidneys.\" Out of this comes a discussion about knife shows - do they exist in the UK? What happens at one? Football signings inevitably crop up (though a burgeoning Guardian fantasy football league is still low on numbers) - with West Ham's new 'keeper and speculation over an Arsenal bid for Alonso. Tactical talk about Civilization Revolutions vies for space amid dodgy pub banter (smashing up indeed) and meat-curious vegetarianism. Fantomex attempts to lift the tone by asking for toilet-based colloquialisms.</p> <p>From here, Subway comes in for a bashing, while Kevin Pietersen attracts support, and Geometry Wars draws praise.

Lots of love for Space Invaders Extreme and GRID, TonyHayers meets Claire Danes, some talk of bicycles. The congestion charge rears its controversial head. In the afternoon, EnglishRed makes an angry point about offline two-player - or the current lack of it:</p> <blockquote> <br> <p>I can't see why split screen offline mutliplayer is lacking from most current gen games- if a game like COD4 can have 4 player split screen how come games like Motorstorm (which I love by the way) cant have 2 player split screen? Every game with multiplayer should have an offline multiplayer option.</p> </blockquote> <br> <p>There does seem to be a general assumption that <em>everyone</em> is now on super fast broadband, with whopping friends lists. A fair amount of agreement follows before the subject of stamp duty 'holidays' makes an astonishing appearance. More interesting is Limnl's mention of <a href=\"http://floodsim.com/\">Floodsim</a>, a flood simulator commissioned by Norwich Union - \"this is the first time I can remember a financial institution creating a game,\" he says, though many of us would like to see the 'stars' of Halifax's ads in some sort of sadistic beat-'em-up.

  "<p>Once upon a time, news about Apple was all about computers. Computers, computers, computers. But now the fastest-moving news is about the iPhone.</p> <p>First up is the apparent discovery of a subsite within the Apple site where, it seems, phones can call home to see whether an application needs to be nuked. Jonathan Zdziarski, author of the book iPhone Open Application Development and an iPhone Forensics manual (odd, we thought there as a ban on discussing programming for the iPhone) says there's a <a href=\"http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2008/08/06/iphone-can-phone-home-and-kill-apps/\">blacklisting mechanism built into the iPhone</a>.</p> <p>The page is at <a href=\"https://iphone-services.apple.com/clbl/unauthorizedApps\">https://iphone-services.apple.com/clbl/unauthorizedApps</a> - though you'll see from looking at it that it's just a proof of concept. But it does sit within Apple's domain. Might work; might not. Has anyone caught their iPhone phoning home to it, though? That's what's not clear.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> John Gruber, who has \"an informed source at Apple\", <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2008/08/core_location_blacklist\">says</a> that it's actually for banning apps from using the Core Location API (which tells you where you are): that's what the \"clbl\" in the URL stands for (\"core location blacklist\"). Which reduces the breadth of the banning, but still leave it there.</p> <p>And the other news is that a madly-overpriced application - Make Me Rich, costing a mere $999 - has been pulled from the iPhone App Store. Not surprisingly, it wasn't popular, since all it basically did was to, um, make the author rich. (There was also something about \"'features a \"secret mantra' that 'may help you to to [sic] stay rich, healthy and successful.'\") And it didn't please some of the people who accidentally bought it - see the comment in the picture above.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.audio-sandwich.com/\">Armin Heinrich</a>, the author, would be sitting quite pretty from a few sales, you'd think. That might be wrong: if people buy it on their credit card and then claim it back as an erroneous (or fraudulent?) transaction, Apple has already taken its 30% cut ($300, near enough) but Heinrich has to pay back the <em>full</em> $999 to the credit card company. So he ends up $300 out of pocket. Oh dear. I am rich? I was rich, now I'm not. That's quite a maneouvre.</p> <p>But so far, no sign of I Am Rich on the app-killing page. I don't think Steve Jobs would really green-light such a move, anyhow.</p>",
  "<p>The latest Batman film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/\">The Dark Knight</a>, continues to break records, taking just 18 days to make <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7544574.stm\">more than $400 million</a>. Its popularity is part of the reinvention of the modern \"realistic\" superhero \u2013 a combination of celebrity twinned with powerful abilities and ultimately a flawed humanity. Yet the ability of celebrity to elevate a person's profile combined with an almost religious devotion to hero worship is a dangerous combination when it comes to choosing the next president of the United States.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/events/audio-and-past-events/democracy-participation-to-passivity---can-things-change\">panel discussion</a> about political participation at the RSA recently, commentator <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/events/speakers-archive/richard-reeves\">Richard Reeves</a> spoke about how everyone overestimates the power of individual action and underestimates the power of collective action. </p> <p>Nowhere is the idea of individual action more pronounced than in a superhero saving the world, especially a world more interconnected by issues than ever before. Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/24/obama-in-berlin-video-of_n_114771.html\">outlined these ideas</a> in Berlin saying that \"now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation, strong institutions, shared sacrifice, and a global commitment to progress, to meet the challenges of the 21st century\".</p> <p>Indeed, Obama is emerging as a 21st century political hero, if not quite yet across America certainly across the world. Rolling Stone magazine described him as \"the new hope\", and his profile is such that the McCain team decided to attack it as shallow celebrity over <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo0ItAXn-Ew&amp;feature=related\">genuine leadership credentials</a>. Attacks on him will mean that Obama, like Batman, will always have to wear a mask to separate the junior senator from Illinois from the ideals he represents which are far greater. It also means that if he is a true political hero he will have to sacrifice himself to the responsibilities of leadership. While Spiderman's uncle warned him that \"with great power comes great responsibility\", the current Bush administration is characterised by an avoidance of responsibility in a never-ending battle to manipulate the reality of its failure in Iraq. </p> <p>But for those suffering from Obama-mania there is a clear danger of disappointment. Beneath the slogan of \"change you can believe in\" is just a political appointment, albeit the most powerful one in the world, but still one surrounded by the checks and balances of America's constitutional democracy. Can Obama <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/issues/\">turn around</a> the American economy, bring health care to all and help 37 million Americans out of poverty just as Superman can stop an asteroid or Batman a psychopathic villain? </p> <p>What about beyond America's borders, where the checks and balances are equally restrictive? Obama, like Gordon Brown before him, is focusing a foreign policy agenda on Afghanistan simply because it is seen as a \"good war\" in contrast to the \"bad war\" in Iraq, ignoring the historical legacy of any major power trying to impose its will on the country. Obama has also placed emphasis on securing the Pakistan\u2013Afghanistan border as a means to strangle the supply lines and strategic depth of the Taliban. Yet as sound as such geopolitical rhetoric appears, the continued inability of the US to secure its own border with Mexico despite massive investment in manpower and surveillance technologies means that securing one of the world's most porous borders will be beyond him. </p> <p>The Bush years were a testimony to overestimating the limits of US power. Democracy and freedom are not reigning in the Middle East. The mighty Nato couldn't find Karadzic for years because he'd grown a beard. The mightier Americans have failed to locate Bin Laden and Mullah Omar, perhaps because they both had beards before the search began. The bottom line is that the superpower does not possess super powers.</p> <p>So what of Batman's voting choice? Reginald Hunter recently <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFFDdgRj3nE\">described</a> the caped crusader as a \"conservatives' wet dream\" \u2013 and certainly the scene where he uses extraordinary rendition in Hong Kong would identify him with the present Republican administration. In reality, however, Batman would be torn between the conventional war hero in McCain, and what Caroline Presno <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caroline-presno/could-obama-be-the-next-p_b_101572.html\">described</a> as a postmodern hero in Obama. Most likely he will reserve judgment of either man until one or other is in power. As Batman once said: \"It is not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is not often that a tiny African country the size of Wales and with even fewer economic resources, has the temerity to publish a report accusing a permanent member of the UN security council of complicity, and indeed participation, in genocide. On Tuesday morning in Kigali, Rwanda, the long awaited Mucyo commission report was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/rwanda/2510818/France-condemns-Rwanda-genocide-report.html\">made public</a>. It indicted 33 members of President Mitterrand's government and military of 1994, which reads like a who's who of luminaries and heavyweights \u2013 ex-prime ministers Dominque de Villepin and \u00c9douard Balladur and Alain Jupp\u00e9, as well as generals and colonels.</p> <p>The commission's report, already condemned as \"unacceptable\" by France, was put together in a painstaking manner over 18 months, hearing from 166 witnesses. Though initiated by Paul Kagame's government, and chaired by Jean de Mucyo, a French-speaking former justice minister, the commission heard the witnesses in public (except when their lives were threatened), and drew their own conclusions. </p> <p>As a researcher of many years standing on this subject, I was called to record a testimony myself in April 2007. The atmosphere in the converted commission hall was hushed, reverent and anticipatory. The commissioners were impressive in accepting no statement without concrete facts and a comprehensive questioning followed each witness's statement of what they had seen or knew. The transparent nature of the commission's set up, and the coverage of every day it sat by independent agencies like Reuters, made sure it fulfilled its remit of investigating thoroughly the truth behind the allegations.</p> <p>And the evidence over the 18 months has been chilling, even for NGOs, researchers and journalists who knew Mitterrand's France has been aiding the Habyarimana government before the genocide that killed a million innocent men, women and children. Witnesses, some only 12 at the time, testified to being raped by French troops from Operation Turquoise in the refugee camp set up for Tutsi survivors at Cyangugu. Belgian and German witnesses spoke of the training given to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interahamwe\">Interahamwe</a> and the financing of the interim government by Paris. Survivors of the massacres at <a href=\"http://www.museum.gov.rw/2_museums/kibuye/bisesero/pages/bisesero.htm\">Bisesero</a> spoke of being \"found\" by French troops who they thought had come to save them. Instead, these same \"white men\" drove off, leaving them to their fate as the killers laughed at them.</p> <p>Many of those who gave evidence to the commission did so at great personal peril. The attitudes that gave rise to genocide are sometimes still apparent in the Hutu community and to go to the international war crimes <a href=\"http://69.94.11.53/\">tribunal</a> in Arusha to testify against those on trial, or against the \"great friend\" of the Hutu Habyarimana government, France, is in some cases to risk death on return to your village.</p> <p>What has the commission taught us? Certainly for NGOs in France, like <a href=\"http://survie.org/\">Survie</a>, and others like myself who have been researching this appalling episode of neocolonial disregard for the lives of Africans, the findings are not new. The testimony is deeply disturbing, as is the expected nonchalance with which the French call such accusations \"unacceptable\", without any attempt to answer the specific charges. Instead they fall back on the usual ploy of accusing Kagame of masterminding the plane crash that killed President Habyarimana and triggered the genocide, despite the lack of evidence for this.</p> <p>The facts, though, don't lie. As Mucyo shows clearly, highly incriminating documentation remains, despite the French burning two rooms worth of their private communications with the Habyarimana government when they left Kigali. There are courageous witnesses coming forward. And there are members of the French armed forces, like Sergeant Thierry Prugnaud, who are breaking ranks and naming the officers and tactics they were told to use against the Tutsi during <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op%C3%A9ration_Turquoise\">Operation Turquoise</a>.</p> <p>Mitterrand's flippant remark to a French journalist a year after the genocide, that \"in country's like that genocide is not so important\", sums up this policy of disregard and dehumanisation.</p> <p>And now the west has a very real dilemma. Looking at all the evidence of the past 14 years, including Mucyo, though there is much else besides, can it stand back and pretend those French politicians and soldiers implicated in the genocide should not go the same way as Milosevic and Karadzic? Is there one rule for the west when it comes to crimes against humanity \u2013 and one for the rest of the world? </p> <p>Kagame should be praised for doing what many other African nations have failed to do in calling the western abuser to public account. It took 60 years for France to apologise for voluntarily deporting 100,000 Jews to the Nazi death camps.

For the survivors, though, with their massively scarred lives, even this would be but small comfort.</p>",
  "<p>Olympic gold medallist Joey Cheek, the co-founder of athletes' advocacy group Team Darfur, was barred from attending the Beijing games (though not from competition, since his is a winter sport), this week by Chinese authorities. </p> <p>The revocation of Cheek's visa sparked protest from US politicians and a promise of a formal complaint from the White House. The Guardian talked to the champion speed skater about the row.</p> <p><strong>George Bush has blasted China's human rights record before travelling to Beijing, but the gesture came after months of criticism from advocates that he had taken too light an approach. Do you think the president has done enough to use the games to press China on Darfur? What more could he be doing?</strong></p> <p>I'm not certain exactly what sorts of things go on behind closed doors, but it's my hope that he'll use every opportunity he can to talk about the issue of Darfur \u2026 As a citizen, I believe passionately in the right of freedom of speech and expression for athletes competing in these games, but as the host of these games, China has gone back on, reneged on a lot of promises \u2026 I think the role China can play [in Darfur] is massive. I hope [Bush] does everything he can.</p> <p><strong>Have you heard anything from the White House or consular authorities about your visa?</strong></p> <p>We haven't heard anything yet from either the consulate or the US government \u2026 I heard there was a statement from the Chinese foreign [ministry] saying \u2026 [they considered it] the right decision \u2026 At best it was sort of childish.</p> <p><strong>You have questioned the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) policy of preventing athletes from speaking out on political issues. Yesterday the IOC said the revocation of your visa was a decision by a \"sovereign government\" and it was not their responsibility to address. How would you respond to that?</strong></p> <p>I'm not at all surprised. As far as the visa issue is concerned \u2026 the question is not whether [China has] to give everyone a visa \u2026 the way they phrased it was bizarre. It's not that I was questioning their right to revoke a visa. They thought I was a spoiler, coming to make some sort of a scene. It's a warning to people who have views different from the Chinese government that they're not welcome \u2026 Obviously, the games we talk about as being not political. But we also talk about [them] as being a forum for humanity \u2026 [at some point] you actually need to begin to live by those ideals.</p> <p><strong>The US Olympic team has chosen Lopez Lomong [a Sudanese runner who fled the Darfur conflict as a child] to be their designated flag-bearer [during the opening ceremonies]. What do you think of the choice?</strong></p> <p>Lopez's story stands on its own \u2026 I think it shows that what US citizens and the American Olympic team values is the opportunity for the world to come together. [H]ow many more people like Lopez are trapped in Darfur? On so many levels, I think it's a beautiful decision.</p>",
  "<p>After almost two years in prison, New Yorker Tremayne Durham could stand it no longer. His craving for a decent bit of nosh was so intense that he agreed to pay a high price - a life sentence.</p> <p>Durham, 33, struck a plea bargain last month in which he was guaranteed a meal of KFC chicken, Popeye's chicken, mashed potato, coleslaw, carrot cake and ice cream - in return for pleading guilty to murder.</p> <p>As part of the deal, and after receiving a life sentence this week in court in Portland, Oregon, Durham will also get a second feast, this time on an Italian theme, with calzone, lasagne, pizza and ice cream.</p> <p>The judge, Eric Bergstrom, is understood to have accepted the bargain because it would save the state of Oregon thousands of dollars in hosting a trial and possible subsequent appeals.</p> <p>The murder happened in June 2006 as a revenge killing. Durham travelled from New York City right across the country to confront an Oregon company from whom he had ordered a truck costing $18,000.</p> <p>He had been intending to enter the ice cream business, but when he changed his mind the company refused to give him a refund on the truck.</p> <p>In a blaze of fury, he intended to collar the owner of the truck company but instead came across a former employee, Adam Calbreath, and shot him dead.</p> <p>He will now have 30 years behind bars before he is given any chance of parole and the opportunity for another KFC feast.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Middlesbrough. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Laura Susan Simmons (vocals, keyboards), Andrew Richard Elliott (guitar, keyboards), Wesley John Stephenson (drums). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> There's been a bit of a thread, or a theme, running through the new band choices this week. We started, on Monday, with Babygod, on Tuesday we had Oh, Atoms who seemed to be suffering from infantile dementia, yesterday's Red Light Company were obsessed with childhood toys and friends, and today we've got a bunch who sing about Sunday School and ice-cream vans. Just wait till you meet tomorrow's act, who, at 15, is the youngest ever New Band of the Day. Next week, we bring you an all-singing, all-dancing foetus. Possibly. <br> Das Wanderlust fetishise adolescence although we hasten to add they don't fetishise adolescents, not as far as we know anyway. They're a bit C86, a bit riot grrrl, and a lot like Tallulah Gosh having a party in a sweetshop with the Fall while Willie Wonka injects Aero bubbles in their veins. They have so far released two scruffy, scrappy, skew-whiff, hyperactive 7-inch singles, the first of which, The Orange Shop, was No 1 in BBC 6 Music \"DJ\" Marc Riley's singles of the year countdown. They have recorded all the right sessions for all the right radio stations, even though they call what they do \"wrong pop\", a title they came up with because it's pop that's misshapen, messed-up, wonky \u2026 wrong. Critics have been unable to decide whether it's structure-less avant-garde experimentalism or tuneful noise, so we'll decide for them: it's an amateurish racket performed by \"musicians\" who don't give a Curly Wurly about musicianship that occasionally, accidentally, chances upon a memorable snatch of melody. It's a 40-year-old man's idea of what 14-year-old girls are into. To be honest, it's a bit creepy, but not in a good way.  What else can we tell you without putting you off? They've got a dog modelling one of their promo T-shirts on their website. The B-side to their next single, Puzzle, which was recorded, not surprisingly, in their singer's bedroom (did they wear pyjamas? Probably), comes in six parts, with subtitles like Theme to a Fictional Spaghetti Western With Whistling, Big Black Ice Cream Van, When You're a Bairn Every Day is Like a Holiday and You Know When it's Not Quite Right? Well it's Not Quite Right. Wacky, them? Their best song, Humbug, has some loony-girl-in-the-attic vocals (\"I have no self-esteem, la-la-la,\" goes Laura Susan Simmons, quite amusingly) and a giant riff made out of a warped guitar/toy keyboard combo that is mesmerising and disturbing in equal measure. And they've got a song called I Wish I Was a Robot that sounds like it was assembled by androids dreaming of electric students during Fresher's Week. They apparently \"find the smokescreen and mirrors of affectation employed by many other groups both hilarious and infuriating\" although really, what's funny but not that annoying is, this is as affected and disingenuous as anything we've heard all year.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"As comforting and sticky as an ice-cream on a hot summer's day.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> John Peel would have loved them. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Reform in 2086 for the C86 centenary tour. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Attract much interest in a wonky pop style \"wrong pop\" tour.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Puzzle is released by Don't Tell Clare on October 6, followed by debut album Horses for Courses. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Kenickie, Huggy Bear, Bis, Tallulah Gosh. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/daswanderlust\">www.myspace.com/daswanderlust</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> CHARLIXCX</p>",
  "<p><br>Still looking ... Astronomy for Insects by blackSKYwhite at Aurora Nova, Edinburgh 2007. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod</p> <p>At the end of St Vincent Street in Edinburgh stands a church that, this year, looks more than a little forlorn. Since 2001 St Stephen's had been the home to Aurora Nova - by far the best place in Edinburgh for international physical theatre. The venue could always be relied on to showcase work which was not only enormously accomplished artistically, but which was often visually stunning. Financial restrictions for most shows on the Fringe mean that they often consist of little more than one performer and a chair. But the stuff at Aurora Nova came with some of the highest production values that you could expect to see on the fringe or anywhere else.</p> <p>Putting that programme together each year must have cost a fortune, and perhaps that is why, only a few months ago, a <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/20604/rising-cost-forces-aurora-nova-out-of\">financial crisis</a> forced artistic director Wolfgang Hoffman to shut his venue down at the last minute. When I heard this news, the Fringe became, for me, just a little duller. To make things worse, two shows at other venues that I had been really looking forward to, both from companies I had first seen at Aurora Nova - Derevo's The Gospel of Anton and Darren Johnston's Ousia - have also suffered eleventh-hour cancellations.</p> <p>So where on earth am I going to get my physical theatre fix this year? Well one place that seems to be eagerly stepping into Aurora Nova's shoes is <a href=\"http://www.zoofestival.co.uk/\">Zoo Southside</a>. Their main space, while not quite as big as that at St Stephen's is, nonetheless, generously proportioned, and for the last three years it has been showcasing work from all over the world. Spend a day there and, alongside work from Korea and Japan, you can witness Holdin' Fast, a weirdly charming piece about love and sex from the Czech company Dot 504; an ice-cool show from British choreographer Tom Dale called Rise which sets contemporary dance to music from groups like Aphex Twin; and a piece called The Factory from last year's <a href=\"http://www.totaltheatre.org.uk/\">Total theatre</a> award winners Precarious. This latter show, set in a dystopic Orwellian future where people are enslaved by manipulative corporations, is far from being unproblematic, and it was marred by unfortunate technical hitches on the night I saw it. But nonetheless it is full of potential and combines moments of hugely imaginative multimedia work with some eerily striking physical sequences.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://www.dancebase.co.uk/\">Dance Base</a> opens its doors today to showcase some of the best contemporary dance from Scotland and across the globe. Over in the Old College Quad, there is a piece called Phantomysteria from Russian company <a href=\"http://www.tnf.cz/wwwroot/?M=Index\u2329=en\">Teatr Novogo Fronta</a>. Last year this venue was home to a remarkable Macbeth from Teatr Biuro Podrozy which boasted witches on stilts and murderers on motorbikes, which is currently <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/Macbeth\">being hosted</a> by the National Theatre in London. So I am really hoping that this new piece will be compare.</p> <p>And of course, among all of the comedy and straight theatre at venues like the Pleasance and the Assembly rooms, there is a smattering of other physical stuff worth seeing. I particularly enjoyed Al Seed's one-man show The Fooligan at the Pleasance Courtyard. Seed creates a series of bizarre but meticulously observed physical characters as he tells the mischievously grotesque tale of the greatest storyteller the world has ever known. The show is a little too brief, but it is a rare thing on the Fringe to actually be left wanting more.</p> <p>Aurora Nova is not necessarily gone for good. There is hope that it will be able to return next year, and I am keeping my fingers firmly crossed. But its absence this year has, at least, forced me to broaden my horizons about what I go and see. Lyn Gardner has <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/theatre/2008/08/edinburgh_2008_theres_still_on.html\">written about</a> how she finds that the Fringe is always able to reinvent itself, but in this situation it's me that has had to do the reinvention. And I'm very glad I have</p>",
  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>How can we celebrate the start of the Olympics?</strong></p> <p>Why, by paying a visit to your local Chinese restaurant, of course. It is 100 years to the month that the first Chinese restaurant opened in Britain. We took a look through the foodie archives to chart the rise and rise of Chinese cuisine:</p> <p><strong>1908: </strong> Chung Koon opens Maxim's in London's Soho, quickly followed by the Cathay in Piccadilly</p> <p><strong>1957: </strong>Chung Koon's son opens up-market Lotus House. It's a roaring success, allowing him to open Britain's first Chinese takeaway, in Queensway</p> <p><strong>1968: </strong>Michael Chow opens Mr Chow, making London the first home of the global chain</p> <p><strong>1970s: </strong>The residents of Birmingham and Edinburgh finally get to sample Chinese food, at The New Happy Gathering and Ping On. The Rendezvous chain introduces Londoners to more slightly more authentic dishes</p> <p><strong>1974: </strong>London's Lee Ho Fook becomes the first Chinese restaurant in Britain to be awarded a Michelin star</p> <p><strong>1980: </strong>Kenneth Lo opens the influential Memories of China. The Zen chain is also a major player during this decade.</p> <p><strong>2001: </strong>Alan Yau opens Hakkasan, the most glamorous Chinese eatery to date, which is frequently ranked as one of the best 50 restaurants in the world</p> <p><strong>c2003: </strong>Regional Chinese food gains grounds, thanks to new restaurants such as London's Yming and Hunan</p> <p><strong>2004: </strong>Dumplings are all the rage after Alan Yau opens his London dim sum restaurant, Yauatcha</p> <p><strong>c2006: </strong>Szechuan restaurants spring up, including Red Chilli in Manchester and Bar Shu in London </p> <h2>IN SEASON</h2> <p><strong>Rabbit</strong></p> <p>For some reason, 'ickle fluffy bunnikens are not a particularly popular foodstuff in Britain. There are three possible reasons for this: their Peter Rabbit connotations; their association with second world war food shortages; and the perception that rabbit meat is a bit dry and/or meagre. To all three problems we say: don't be ridiculous. Morally, eating wild rabbit is no different to eating a chicken or a cow. Historical associations change - look at oysters, traditionally a food for the poor. And cooked properly, rabbit is delicious - buy two if you've got a hearty appetite.</p> <p>Wild rabbit (don't buy farmed) is low in fat and high in protein. At this time of year, you can throw them on the barbecue, anointed with olive oil and herbs. Later in the year, the rabbits will be older and the meat tougher, so slow cooking is a better option. Foodie friends of rabbit include bacon, mustard and cider \u2013 experiment, or try these <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/20/recipes.foodanddrink \">three great recipes</a> from Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Special thanks to reader Kate Basham, who emailed offering a ray of hope on the broad bean front.

The Baglioni hotel in London's Kensington is offering a delicious afternoon pick-me-up for \u00a328 (or \u00a336 with a glass of champagne). We drooled over the warm chocolate scones with chocolate spread and clotted cream, we lusted after the dainty chocolate pastries, and we were downright excited by the hot chocolate on a stick. But in the end, the best bit was eating cutesy sarnies and glugging champers in a sexy room with charming service - leading us to conclude that perhaps we aren't the chocoholics we thought we were.

All four are members of the international Students for a Free Tibet group.</p> <p>Fairbrother and Thom flew in to London's City airport and were welcomed by family, friends and members of the Tibetan community.</p> <p>The pair, wearing Tibetan scarves around their necks, told reporters that they had faced tough questioning but were well treated by the Chinese authorities.</p> <p>\"I have been a Tibet supporter for a long time and climbing is a hobby and I though I could use my skills to make a real difference,\" said Thom. \"We wanted to make it clear to world leaders and the Chinese government the need for real freedom and basic human rights in Tibet.\"</p> <p>He dismissed suggestions that the protest would have no impact on China. \"With the media coverage around the world, we are convinced the government will sit up and take heed \u2026 Certainly it was worth it. The job is not done. It remains an occupied territory and we feel like we have achieved part of the step to improving the situation for Tibet.\" </p> <p>Fairbrother said: \"We were taken to a police station and questioned but we were treated fine. One of the reasons we were there was because Tibetans could not be there in our place \u2013 they were refused visas and would have faced harsher treatment.\"</p> <p>Fairbrother's family last night claimed the Bristol university student's online blog of a trip to Tibet in 2005 had been doctored after she was arrested and detained. </p> <p>The posting, A Short Stay in Tibet, begins with a description of life there and turns into a polemic against China, but appears to have been clumsily changed to read more sympathetically. It reads: \"I admit that I have been under much influence of militant Free Tibet organisations back home. What China is doing now, and what China HAS done, are so different, and I am angry with myself for not realising the distinction before now.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336315392\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/07/theblog.jpg\" alt=\"Extract from 'A Short Stay in Tibet'\" width=\"460\" height=\"166\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extract from A Short Stay in Tibet</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her mother, Linda, a TV journalist, said: \"This certainly sounds unlike anything Lucy would have written. I saw the original and I certainly have no memory of anything like that figuring in it. It doesn't sound like her phraseology. She read classics, she writes beautifully and this doesn't sound at all like her style, quite apart from her sentiments. I would imagine it's been done today. Students for a Free Tibet have in the past had tampering with their own internal emails.\" </p> <p>The blog juxtaposes severe criticism of what Fairbrother saw in Tibet with awkward words of approval. \"We could feel the atmosphere of oppression just walking through the streets and monasteries - our guide was hushed by a monk when he uttered '14th Dalai Lama', and guiltily giggled as he mentioned the official 11th Panchen Lama (the 2nd most important leader in Tibet before China) who is a Chinese replacement for the 'real' Panchen Lama, who has been in prison since his recognition at the age of 6. </p> <p>\"Even so, monks are not being tortured on the streets, as the impression is given, and in fact just seem to get on with their business within their monasteries, or walk around the streets, seemingly unbothered. The Chinese maintains [sic] an impressive presence, and there is still a large amount of Han immigration, which is sad, but nothing to the extent that is advertised at home.\" </p> <p>Lhadon Tethong, the executive director of Students for a Free Tibet, said she assumed the blog had been altered after their detention. \"It is something that we are pretty used to. I am just surprised that they didn't take it down instead of trying to misrepresent her views.\" </p> <p>She said further protests were likely during the games. \"There will certainly be people of conscience who will try to speak out in peaceful ways while the world spotlight is on China.\"</p>",
  "<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertwatson\">Professor Bob Watson</a> is not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/audio/2008/aug/07/james.randerson.climate.change.bob.watson\">speaking</a> out of turn in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/06/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">telling the world</a> to prepare for four degrees of global warming. \"Mitigate for two degrees; adapt for four\" has long been the catchphrase among climate negotiators and campaigners. Translated, that means: try to reduce emissions to stay below two degrees of warming, but also prepare for the worst. </p> <p>And Bob Watson should know \u2013 he is the former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (<a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">IPCC</a>), but <a href=\"http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/climate-change/mg17423392.400\">was kicked out at the behest</a> of the Bush administration for being too vocal about the threat presented by global warming. (Any sceptic reading who thinks that the IPCC is a conspiracy of environmentalists take note: it is a creature of government as well as of science.) He has long made clear his own personal passion and commitment to tackling the issue \u2013 often without mincing his words. He is also someone with a very wide-ranging perspective: after leaving the IPCC, Watson chaired the <a href=\"http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.aspx\">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment</a>, a landmark UN study published in 2005 looking at the totality of human impact on the planet's natural systems. (The news wasn't good.)</p> <p>The problem with the \"mitigate for two degrees; adapt for four\" strategy is that it is doomed to fail. Yes, we should certainly prepare for the worst as far as possible \u2013 with flood defences, drought-resistant crops and strategies to ameliorate the loss of wildlife, at the very least \u2013 but a look at the likely impact of a four-degrees temperature rise suggests that such a dramatic change would probably stretch society's capacity for adaptation to the limit, not to mention having a disastrous effect on the natural ecosystems that support humanity as a whole. </p> <p>By the time global temperatures reach four degrees, much of humanity will be short of water for drinking and irrigation: glaciers in the Andes and Himalayas, which feed river systems on which tens of millions depend, will have melted, and their rivers will be seasonally running dry. Whole weather systems like the Asian monsoon (which supports 2 billion people) may alter irrevocably. Deserts will have spread into Mediterranean Europe, across most of southern Africa and the western half of the United States. Higher northern latitudes will be plagued with regular flooding. Heatwaves of unimaginable ferocity will sear continental landscapes: the UK would face the kind of summer temperatures found in northern Morocco today. The planet would be in the throes of a mass extinction of natural life approaching in magnitude that at the end of the Cretaceous period, 65m years ago, when more than half of global biodiversity was wiped out. </p> <p>Four degrees of warming would also cross many of the \"tipping points\" which so concern climate scientists: the Amazon rainforest would likely collapse and burn, as part of a massive further release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems \u2013 the reverse of the current situation, where trees and soils absorb and store a good portion of our annual emissions. Most of the Arctic permafrost will lie in the melt zone, and will be steadily releasing methane, accelerating warming still further. The northern polar ice cap will be a distant memory, and Greenland will be melting so rapidly that sea level rise by the end of the century will be measured in metres rather than centimetres. <br> Hence the current effort \u2013 led by scientists, in the main \u2013 to drop the two degrees target and talk instead about getting carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere back down to less dangerous levels. This year's CO2 concentration is 385 parts per million (ppm) \u2013 now <a href=\"350.org\">a campaign is forming</a> to get them back down to 350ppm, about the level they were at in the mid 1980s. This isn't just about reducing emissions, it is about getting emissions quickly down to zero (by 2050 or earlier), and then removing some of the excess carbon that humanity has already dumped into the atmosphere. The planet will still get warmer, but on nothing like the scale currently predicted. </p> <p>The harsh truth is that the latest science shows that even two degrees is not good enough, never mind four. And since four degrees would be a catastrophe that many of us, or our children, would not survive, it is surely our absolute duty to do everything in our power to avoid it.</p>",

  "<p>Since the smoking ban was introduced, dancefloors across the nation \u2013 whether nightclubs, wedding receptions or pub discos \u2013 have suffered from half the people suddenly disappearing for a cheeky fag. A year on and Britain's clubs and music venues have gone beyond decorating outdoor smoking pens and are moving dancefloors into the great outdoors. So now you don't have to go to Ibiza to feel the sun on your skin while getting your groove on. <br> </p> <h2>1. Saltwater, Nottingham</h2> <p>Perched atop an identikit mall in the heart of Nottingham, Saltwater is a spectacular rooftop restaurant and bar. However its real highlight is a 250-capacity roof terrace and garden, and each weekend DJs play anything from deep house to disco, with sweeping vistas of Nottingham's skyline providing a breathtaking visual backdrop. Canopies and eco-unfriendly heaters (tsk) mean the sun doesn't have to be shining to keep you dancing alfresco.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Saltwater, The Corner House, Forman Street, Nottingham; +44 (0)115 924 2664; <a href=\"http://www.saltwater-restaurant.com\">www.saltwater-restaurant.com</a><br> </p> <h2>2. The Rainbow, Birmingham</h2> <p>From the outside it's an unassuming boozer, but inside you'll find local art adorning the Victorian pub walls and when you head out back into The Rainbow's courtyard you'll discover an outdoor space that's home to some of the hippest club nights in the country. Recent events include gigs by cosmic-electro rockers The Presets and sultry house band Crazy P. During the summer bands play in the courtyard every Wednesday and Friday, and monthly Sunday raves run from 3pm to midnight. Last month the team behind The Rainbow also opened The Beach, featuring 40 tonnes of sand under a towering railway arch. The bar is in an ice-cream van, the DJ booth's a beach hut and finishing touches include palm trees, hammocks and deck chairs. Cult underground house and techno afternoon/evening rave Below resides here, and there's also a Hacienda party featuring 808 State and Andrew Weatherall (Aug 29).

Factory Club, Birmingham</h2> <p>The former Birds' Custard Factory has been converted into one of Europe's largest creative hubs for small arts and media businesses, and is also home to the Factory Club. Previously known as the Medicine Bar, the Factory Club spills out on to a swimming pool, where every weekend during the summer you will find poolside parties. On special occasions such as mini-festival Hardcore Til I Die (August 30), the pool's actually emptied and becomes a somewhat surreal dancefloor.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Factory Club, The Custard Factory, Gibb Square, Birmingham; +44 (0)121 224 7502; <a href=\"http://www.factoryclub.co.uk\">www.factoryclub.co.uk</a><br> </p> <h2>4.

On summer Sundays The Courtyard Bar is transformed into a Glaswegian version of London's Secretsundaze or Sydney's Sounds On Sunday: highlights this summer have included a dubstep extravaganza with Jack Sparrow and Sunday Circus - an afternoon of minimal electronic dance music from one of European dance scene's current beaus Matthias Tanzmann.

Borge's son has expanded the Kro empire to five varying establishments in Manchester, however it's the original on Oxford Road that's joined forces with one of the city's musical institutions, Fat City Records, to serve up funky backyard barbecues.

The Tyne, Newcastle</h2> <p>This historic Byker pub used to have a house of ill-repute upstairs but in recent years it has become known instead for its music, both live bands and electronica. Over the last two years, The Tyne's bear-pit of a beer garden has done away with pub benches and put on sweaty raves headlined by Berlin scamps Modeselektor, and Croydon dubstep hero Benga. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mailing Street; +44 (0)191 265 2550; <a href=\"http://www.thetyne.com\">www.thetyne.com</a><br> </p> <h2>7.

On top of two conventional dancefloors, its piece de resistance is a 1,000 square foot beach \u2013 with imported Caribbean white sand and white-washed walls. Every Sunday is the 54 BBQ Beach Club running from noon till midnight, with music spanning dubstep, electro, garage and house, so you can forget mum's Sunday roast and enjoy Caribbean food and boogie an afternoon and evening away\u2026 in the shadow of a office block. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mile End Road, E1; +44 (0)207 790 1005; <a href=\"http://www.bar54.co.uk\">www.bar54.co.uk</a><br> </p> <h2>9.

Dex is an art-deco building housing a nightclub and members' bar, and most importantly a beautiful roof terrace. Bands playing Brixton Academy put on hush-hush after parties here, while Secretsundaze hosts clandestine dates here, and Ninja Tune threw a barbecue a month ago. Sunday afternoons is the time to go: Living City versus Hindsight (August 20) leans towards techno with guests including Evil Eddie Richards (Fabric). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Brixton Road, SW9; +44 (0)20 7326 4455; <a href=\"http://www.dexclub.co.uk\">www.dexclub.co.uk</a></p> <h2>10. Reclaim The Beach, London</h2> <p>Fake beaches with imported sand are all very well, but you don't need 'em when you can have the Thames' sediment between your toes instead. It might sound preposterous, but right outside the Royal Festival Hall on the bustling Southbank is a sizeable beach that's revealed when the tide goes out. During the summer Reclaim The Beach hark back to acid house's heyday with free, impromptu raves featuring techno, and drumming. As with most word-of-mouth parties in the 21st century, Facebook's where to find out more info and dates \u2013 join the reclaim the beach group. Dipping your toe in the Thames while you dance the night away in the heart of establishment London, with bemused Japanese tourists as spectators, is a surreal London delight. Bring your own buckets, spades, barbecues and booze. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Beach under Festival pier, Queens Walk, London, SE1</p>",
