  "<p>Six years have passed since the NBA commissioner David Stern first floated the idea of expanding his league to include one or more teams based in Europe. \"Those are not fanciful discussions or thoughts,\" said Stern at the NBA's 2002 All-Star game in Philadelphia, adding that the league was also looking at opportunities in Mexico. \"Give us three to four years to come up with the right plan.\"</p> <p>That plan remains, at best, a half-formed one. Yesterday London hosted its second NBA pre-season game in as many years \u2014 between the Miami Heat and the New Jersey Nets \u2014 and yet European expansion was not even top of the agenda at the pregame press conferences. Instead Stern's first concern was announcing the league's new agreement with AEG, the sports and entertainment group who own the O2, to design and operate a number of new basketball arenas in China.</p> <p>\"The scale is, I think, going to be a dozen or so,\" Stern said yesterday before suggesting that each arena would, like the O2, be designed as a family entertainment venue \u2014 complete with cinemas, theatres and concert halls \u2014 rather than simply a basketball stadium. \"[The AEG president and CEO Timothy] Leiweke will say 25 but I think that's a little high.\"</p> <p>That Stern should have turned his dreams of expansion towards China is hardly a surprise given the country's economic emergence and the fact that basketball is already massively popular there. The success in recent years of Chinese players such as the Nets forward Yi Jianlian \u2014 who scored 17 points in his team's 94\u201392 win at the O2 last night \u2013 and the Houston Rockets cent re Yao Ming has increased the country's interest in the NBA to the point where 1.6bn viewers watched league programming last year while one-third of NBA.com's web traffic came from the Mandarin Chinese section.</p> <p>Such figures are a stark contrast with the UK, where the NBA has struggled to hold the public's attention. Stern was quick to point out last night that tickets for this year's game had sold out more rapidly than they did last year, yet it took the league far longer to find a broadcaster for the event. A deal was eventually reached with Setanta but Five, who hold the rights to the league's regular season games, again plan to broadcast no more than one game a week.</p> <p>Stern has identified Britain as one of the countries he believes could eventually host a franchise yet there is scant evidence to suggest that such a team could fill a venue such as the O2 over the course of 41 regular-season home games \u2014 the number that NBA teams play every year. Basketball may be, as Stern points out, the second-most played sport in Britain among people under the age of 18, but that does not necessarily translate to supporters who would pay \u00a330 and up to attend such a high number of games.</p> <p>\"I saved up for this one but I couldn't afford it if it was every week, let alone more than once a week,\" said Jermaine, a 16-year-old Heat fan last night. \"It's fun to come down and see all the famous players but really I think I'd rather just play.\"</p> <p>If the low attendances in Britain's existing basketball leagues do not offer much encouragement then at least the national side does. Britain will compete in EuroBasket \u2014 the sport's European Championship \u2014 next year for the first time in the tournament's 73-year existence. The team was only reformed after a 14-year break \u2014 during which time England and Scotland competed separately \u2014 in 2006 but the presence of the Chicago Bulls forward Luol Deng helped them to win a group containing Israel, Bosnia and the Czech Republic.</p> <p>Stern, who already helped to resolve an insurance issue that might have prevented Deng from taking part in qualifying,yesterday vowed to assist Britain in any way he could. \"We were very encouraged by the fact that Team GB qualified for EuroBasket,\" Stern said before suggesting that British players may get the opportunity to play in the NBA's summer league \u2014 as China did before this year's Games in Beijing \u2014 and that NBA Development League teams may visit Britain for exhibition games. \"It's the same type of thing we have extended to other countries because we love to grow the sport of basketball.\"</p> <p>Stern will hope that Deng, a 6ft 9in 23-year-old who last July signed a six-year, $71m (\u00a341m) contract with the Bulls, can do for the sport in Britain what Yi Jianlian and others have done for it in China. In that regard the failure to bring the Bulls to Britain looks like a missed opportunity.</p> <p>\"We believe these games represent us moving past the point of simply having a player from the country in which we are playing,\" insisted Stern when asked why he had not selected teams featuring prominent European players for this year's games in the continent \u2014 but the number of fans wearing replica Bulls shirts with Deng's name on at the O2 suggest he may have misjudged the situation.</p> <p>Stern might also argue he is in no rush \u2014 he has stuck to a loose timeframe of \"the next decade\" for European expansion and seems happy in the meantime focus on increasing awareness of the sport ahead of London 2012.</p> <p>Nevertheless he would do well to avoid moving too slowly. Both the NFL and NHL have now brought regular-season games to Britain, despite the fact that neither can claim anything like such participation in their respective sports. Last night's game was keenly contested and the Nets undoubtedly enjoyed their victory but neither team looked as fluid as you would expect them to be in a competitive game, combining for 47 turnovers.</p> <p>\"I think it's fair to say we'll see a minimum of one regular season game in the UK before 2012,\" said Stern yesterday when pressed on the issue. He will have to hope last night's boisterous crowd knows how to be patient.</p> <h2>Other American sports spreading the gospel</h2> <p><strong>NFL</strong></p> <p>The game at Wembley between San Diego Chargers and New Orleans Saints on October 26 will be only the third regular-season National Football League game ever to be played abroad. \"It's another positive step in the effort to globalise our great sport,\" said the Chargers president, Dean Spanos. \"It's also a chance for the Chargers to expand our international fan base.\" Last year's game between New York Giants and Miami Dolphins, right, sold out quickly with reports of 500,000 ticket requests within 72 hours. It was also a learning experience for Miami Dolphins' Channing Crowder, who was pleased to find out that people spoke English in London.<br><strong><br>MLB</strong></p> <p>Biennial All Star games between Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball started in Japan in 1986. The MLB has staged three season-openings in Japan, where it has a huge following, although some Americans are unhappy about games being played abroad and some Japanese players and coaches upset because it undermines the domestic league. \"It's ludicrous,\" the Chiba Lotte Marines coach, Bobby Valentine, said as his team had to play at the same time as Boston Red Sox faced Oakland Athletics.<br><strong><br>NHL</strong></p> <p>The National Hockey League has started its past two seasons in Europe and there has even been talk of the league expanding to include European teams. \"On behalf of the players, I would say that door is very much open,\" Paul Kelly of the NHL Players' Association said. \"We need to look forward and recognise that this, of all the major sports, is the one sport that probably could expand into Europe.\" Last year's two games in London between Anaheim Ducks and LA Kings were sell-outs, as were this month's regular-season contests in Stockholm (at the 13,500-capacity Globen Arena) and Prague (at the 17,000-seater O2 Arena).</p>",
  "<p>I've never been a massive fan of Alastair Campbell. Not because of his bullying and warmongering - that can be quite endearing in a man. But there's just something so utterly charmless about him. I've always thought of him as being like a cold wind: someone who can, I imagine, suck the warmth out of a room, simply by being in it.</p> <p>In <strong>Cracking Up</strong> (BBC2, Sunday), though, we see another side to him. This is his film about his depression and the breakdown he had. What a breakdown it was, too. There weren't just voices in his head, there were brass bands and entire orchestras. Men were following him, others testing him. Road signs and adverts contained coded personal messages, colours took on a sinister significance. He was sure he was going to die. Campbell ended up naked in a police cell, and then hospitalised - bewildered, isolated, paranoid.</p> <p>It was a spectacular and terrifying fall, into a deep dark chasm - from which he clambered back, obviously, to bully and to warmonger, and to be in Tony's gang. But ever since he has suffered bouts of severe depression. </p> <p>Here he talks about it all with incredible honesty, and a refreshing matter-of-factness. That has to be applauded. He's doing his bit - a considerable bit - to remove the fog of fear and hush that surrounds mental illness. </p> <p>There's no better way to humanise someone than through a bit of openness and honesty. A chink in the armour helps, too, and in Campbell's case it isn't a chink, it's a bloody great gaping hole. Oh, and the other thing that makes Campbell less odious, of course, is that he is no longer in a position of such power that he can seriously affect our lives.</p> <p>Anyway, he's also very good - surprisingly good - at describing it all. I especially like the way he talks about his recovery. He took each day as Geoff Boycott (Campbell's favourite batsman) would face a delivery. Nothing fancy, no heavy hitting or lashing out. Just steady, methodical and safe - one at a time, batting them back, counting them off. Staying in. </p> <p>He even smiles, laughs a couple of times, too, in this film. Could it be that it's genuine laughter, not sneery and mocking? Are we going to have to rethink Campbell completely? That would be overdoing it. \"I think I'm highly lovable,\" he says at one point. No, Alastair, you're not. But it is possible that you are human, after all. </p> <p>If Simon Schama's American programme on a Friday night is just a bit too brainy for you, here's <strong>Stephen Fry in America</strong> (BBC1, Sunday). Not that this is America for thickies, it's just that in with the history, there are lobsters and ice-cream, hunting trips, and huge dollops of creamy English charm, which of course they just love over there. </p> <p>What's nice about it is that he doesn't do the usual British thing, which is to sneer at Americans for not knowing about the rest of the world, and for being fat and stupid. This is more of a celebration of the States. They love him, he loves them. And if there is just the tiniest hint of mockery, it's so gentle that the mockees wouldn't know it was happening, and even if they did, they'd probably enjoy it. </p> <p>Stephen Fry is driving a black London cab (as he does at home) through every single state, slowly working his way west. He stops off at the Ben &amp; Jerry's factory to invent a new flavour, goes deer shooting in the woods with a bunch of rednecks - though Stephen doesn't want to kill the deer (he's less squeamish about the lobsters, which are plunged, live, into boiling water for lunch). Happily, there are no deer today - maybe they heard him coming. He goes for a sail on a beautiful yacht, gets a tour of a nuclear submarine, takes a steam train up a mountain, and has tea and a chat with a black, gay, Republican Baptist. He meets an Englishman in New York, the one who once sang a song on that very subject, and gives him a ride, presumably so he can say he once had that Sting in the back of his cab. </p> <p>This is travel booked through Michael Palin Tours, more charming than purposeful. I'm not really sure if I'm learning anything. Who cares, though - there's Schama on a Friday for that. This is just a jolly road trip, very jolly, for a Sunday night.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing that strikes you about Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's writing room is how clean it is. There are a few Star Wars action figures and the odd movie poster but mainly it's white walls and untouched carpet - which seems a little inappropriate for the nation's greatest on-screen slobs. \"It's just been decorated,\" says Pegg defensively. \"And we're married men now,\" adds Frost.</p> <p>It may also be because the duo are just too busy to make a mess. With How to Lose Friends still pulling in the punters at the cinema, and two movies going into production next year - their road movie, Paul, and the third in Pegg and director Edgar Wright's blood-and-ice-cream trilogy, The World's End - Pegg has decided this would be a good time to return to the small screen, writing and producing Life and Other Distractions - a 13-part comedy drama for Channel 4.</p> <p>\"These days, if you want to be a film actor you have to be careful with TV because it's that old thing - if people see you all the time on TV they're not keen to pay to see you at the cinema,\" he explains. \"That doesn't mean I don't love TV. This idea really appealed.\" </p> <p>The show will be a light drama about a family aimed at younger viewers, Pegg says. \"My involvement will be limited but I want to be a showrunner and have script control. I was interested in that age group, having grown up with shows like Grange Hill, and I wanted to do something outside my comfort zone. It's more kitchen sink than my usual stuff - having said that, any episodes I write will probably involve aliens and monsters.\"</p> <p>Pegg's ambitions reflect those of Big Talk, the company behind all his ideas since the 1999 sitcom Spaced. It has just sold a 25% stake to the BBC's distribution arm BBC Worldwide - which has been charged with seeking massive commercial expansion - and has recruited senior executives from across the industry. Kenton Allen, the BBC's former creative head of comedy, who has the Royle Family and Ideal on his CV, joins as joint chief executive; Luke Alkin, C4's ex-head of drama commissioning, is on board as executive producer for drama; and Skins producer Chloe Moss is drama development producer - all following Matthew Justice, who left Lunar Films to become Big Talk's managing director. </p> <p>The hope is that Big Talk will be able to develop movies, dramas and TV comedies with guaranteed global distribution through the Worldwide deal and a tight relationship with Working Title - which has funded all of Pegg's previous movies.</p> <p>With so much in development, Big Talk has had to expand, says its founder and chief executive, Nira Park.\"We've just signed a deal with Film 4, we have 18 films in development, we have drama in development with Channel 4, three films with Working Title and there was just me, Simon, Nick, Edgar and our head of production,\" Park says. \"We needed other people and people similar to us.\"</p> <p>At the same time, however, Allen's move from broadcaster to indie reflects a trend across the industry. ITV's controller of drama, Andy Harries, Michele Buck, controller of ITV productions, and Damien Timmer, executive producer at United Productions, have all made similar moves in the last 12 months. Could C4's budget cuts, ITV's exit from the FTSE 100 and threats to the BBC's licence fee mean talent is fleeing to the indie sector?</p> <p>\"I don't agree British broadcasting is collapsing,\" Allen argues. \"The BBC spends more money on comedy than any other broadcaster, but there's a bigger world out there. If you make a brilliant show for the BBC, more often than not, when the transfer happens it doesn't happen with you. As much as you want to look after that show as it crosses the Atlantic, your heart should be in giving the licence payer what they pay for - more British programming. With all the excitement about British comedy in the US - from The Office to Peep Show - it's a good time to not be in-house.\"</p> <p>A US influence can also be found in \"first look\" and development deals that Big Talk are in the process of signing with Robert Popper - who commissioned Spaced at Channel 4 and produced Look Around You and Peep Show - and Simon Curtis, the drama producer-director behind Cranford. The company's slate includes Jeremy Dyson adapting Jonathan Coe's What a Carve Up! for TV and a \"will they won't they?\" sitcom for Channel 4 called Free Agents, starring Sharon Horgan, Anthony Head and Stephen Mangan, which is due to hit screens in January. </p> <p>Will so many projects dilute the family atmosphere of Big Talk? \"There's no ambition to grow into a monolithic entity like Talkback that produces gardening programmes and series on dog training,\" Allen insists. </p> <p>\"It would be a shame if Big Talk lost its quirky editorial slant through huge growth,\" says Andrew Newman, C4's head of comedy and entertainment. \"They are one of the few companies who are yet to have made anything bad. It's all down to quality control and I think Nira has the judgment and relationships with people to make sure that doesn't happen.\"</p> <p>Pegg certainly doesn't see a problem with Big Talk replicating something like a US studio on a smaller scale. \"Working Title is the only British film production house that can get a British film made by itself,\" he argues. \"We like working with them. But it would be nice if there were other companies like that because it would mean a healthy British film industry.\"</p> <p>Big Talk's Worldwide deal, which will provide cash and confidence for expansion, is key to the company's aspirations. </p> <p>\"Distribution is becoming crucial to your business plan,\" Park says. \"Broadcasters are cutting what they pay per hour, so we have to use our knowledge of film financing, co-production and the like to make the kind of shows we'd simply get the budget for a few years ago.\"</p> <p>However, with Worldwide executives shortly to appear in front of the culture, media and sport select committee to explain its rapidly expanding commercial agenda, government curbs on Worldwide's activity could yet seriously hinder Big Talk's expansion. </p> <p>Not that the talent would be likely to leave if that were the case. \"Working with anyone other than Nira would be a step down,\" says Frost. \"I've worked with other independent companies and, to be honest, they've always seemed a bit hackneyed.\"</p>",
  "<p>The two brightest planets are on show in our evening sky, though we need to be quick to spy Venus before it drops below the west-south-west horizon one hour after sunset. Jupiter, obvious low in the south at nightfall, sets in the south-west by 22:30.</p> <p>Much higher in the sky, the Summer Triangle tumbles westwards from high in the south at nightfall and Pegasus, autumn's centrepiece constellation, climbs to replace it. By 23:00 tonight, the area on our chart stands high on the meridian and the Hunter's Moon lies just outside the lower left-hand edge of the chart.</p> <p>The Square of Pegasus is the signature feature in the constellation even though its corner stars are well spaced and not particularly bright. One of them, Alpheratz, now belongs to neighbouring Andromeda. Indeed, it once held the celestial equivalent of dual nationality, being regarded as both Alpha Andromedae and Delta Pegasi. The only other case like it concerns Elnath, the star at the tip of the Taurus's north horn, which was also claimed by Auriga.</p> <p>Now Andromeda's official border just nips Alpheratz away from Pegasus.</p> <p>At magnitude 2.0, though, it is still the brightest member of the Square. Algenib, mag 2.8, is less than half as bright while Markab is mag 2.5. These three are all hot blue-white stars, larger than our sun, that range in distance from 97 light years for Alpheratz, to about 333ly for Algenib and 140ly for Markab.</p> <p>Scheat is a red giant near 200ly that, like many in its class, pulsates slowly and varies in brightness between mag 2.3 and 2.7 so that it is sometimes almost as dim as Algenib and at other times superior to Markab. We can appreciate its colour and follow its brightness changes with nothing more than our unaided eyes. A fainter but similar star is TX Piscium in the so-called Circlet of Pisces to the south of the Square.</p> <p>Enif, mag 2.4 and usually the brightest star in Pegasus, lies well to the west and sneaked onto last month's chart when I also mentioned the superb globular star cluster M15 only 4\u00b0 to its north-west. The constellation lacks other bright \"deep sky\" attractions but is replete with countless distant and dim galaxies as we look away from the dusty plane of the Milky Way.</p> <p>Even stars in Pegasus are at a premium and, despite its size, very few are visible to the naked eye within the Square. Indeed, counting them gives as an indication of the sky's darkness and clarity. On moonlit nights like tonight, your score might well be zero.</p> <p>Look for 51 Pegasi, a sun-like star that shines at mag 5.5 and lies just off the west side of the Square at a distance of 50ly. We now know of more than 300 planets around other stars, but the first to be found, and unofficially called Bellerophon, was discovered around 51 Pegasi in 1995. It orbits every 4.2 days at a distance of almost 8m km and, like so many other exoplanets, it is massive and gaseous - a so-called \"hot Jupiter\".</p>",
  "<p>England's position in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldcup2010qualifiers\">Group Six</a> was strengthened by the goalless draw between <strong>Ukraine</strong> and <strong>Croatia</strong> in Kharkov, which left Fabio Capello's team two points clear at the top. </p> <p>The visitors had the better chances on Saturday evening, Ivica Olic heading against the crossbar in the 50th minute, while he and Luka Modric drew fine saves from the Ukraine keeper Andriy Pyatov. Slaven Bilic's side remain third in the group, five points behind England. </p> <p><strong>Germany</strong>'s coach, Joachim L\u00f6w, said he will no longer select striker Kevin Kuranyi after his reaction to being left out of the team that beat <strong>Russia</strong> 2-1 in Dortmund on Saturday. Kuranyi left the stands at the end of the first half and did not return to the team hotel later, the German FA said. First-half goals from Lukas Podolski and Michael Ballack put the Euro 2008 finalists in control before Andrei Arshavin pulled one back. </p> <p>Goals from Joris Mathijsen and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar brought <strong>Holland</strong> a 2-0 victory over<strong> Iceland</strong> in Rotterdam, and took them back above Scotland at the top of the group. </p> <p><strong>Spain </strong>maintained their 100% record in Group Five qualifying with a comfortable 3-0 victory away to <strong>Estonia</strong>. A header from Juanito and a David Villa penalty put the European champions in control in the first half before Carles Puyol nodded in a third. </p> <p>The <strong>France </strong>striker Thierry Henry urged the French FA yesterday to confirm coach Raymond Domenech in his job despite the team's poor results. Les Bleus recovered from two down to draw 2-2 in <strong>Romania</strong> on Saturday but are only fourth in Group Seven. \"There is a point when things need to be clear. We must end this debate,\" Henry said. \"You can't confirm someone with conditions.\" </p> <p>The holders <strong>Italy</strong> drew 0-0 draw against <strong>Bulgaria</strong> in World Cup qualifying Group Eight but the match in Sofia was marred by crowd trouble. A section of the visiting fans threw bottles at Bulgarian supporters and made fascist salutes. Alberto Gilardino spurned the best chance of the match in the 72nd minute but Italy remain top of Group Eight.</p> <p>John Barnes will take over a <strong>Jamaica</strong> team in good heart next month after their surprise 1-0 win over Sven-Goran Eriksson's <strong>Mexico</strong> in Kingston on Saturday.

  "<p>As the nation's attention keeps skipping from the financial meltdown to the presidential election and back again, nothing serves as a more apt metaphor for John McCain's campaign right now than the state of the markets and the popular response to it.</p> <p>People hold on, thinking it will bottom out, only to find it plumbing new and unexpected depths. Gripped by panic and fuelled by fear, those responsible for guiding it to a better place keep steering it into the ground. No one knows where it will all end, but it is already clear that it will end badly and that everyone will have to pay for it.</p> <p>The McCain campaign is in freefall. This time last month, fresh off the nomination of Sarah Palin and their convention, the Republican ticket held a two-point lead in national polls and was ahead in all the states that George Bush won in 2004 with the exceptions of New Mexico, Colorado and Iowa. McCain was also mounting a serious challenge in Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire - states that Democrat John Kerry won with slim margins in 2004. McCain was not in a strong position, but it was a viable one.</p> <p>Today he is trailing by an average of seven points nationally, has pulled out of Michigan and finds himself struggling in Virginia, North Carolina and Indiana - states where Republicans don't usually have to run seriously, let alone sweat. Meanwhile, he is now losing in Florida and Ohio - the totemic prizes of 2000 and 2004 respectively. On most present projections, McCain could win every remaining toss-up state and Obama would still take the White House by a huge margin. If the vote were held today and the polls were accurate, we would be witnessing a landslide.</p> <p>So if the McCain campaign seems desperate it's because it has every reason to be. It has a candidate - who thanks to his war record and foreign policy experience, would have been formidable in 2004 - being handled by Bush strategists who are working from a playbook of smear and innuendo that worked brilliantly in 2000 and 2004, and running on a tax-cutting manifesto that has barely been updated since the mid-80s. The result is a mixture of the demotic, the erratic and the irrelevant.</p> <p>\"I think you're seeing a turning point,\" says Saul Anuzis, the Republican chairman in Michigan. \"You're starting to feel real frustration because we are running out of time. Our message, the campaign's message, isn't connecting.\"</p> <p>If anything, the trouble is quite the opposite. Their message is connecting too well. Last week the plan was to change the message from fixing the economy to denigrating Obama's character. This task was left to Palin, who executed it faithfully and effectively.</p> <p>\"For me, the heels are on, the gloves are off,\" she told Republican donors in Florida. For the rest of the week she invoked Obama's association with Bill Ayers, the former 60s radical and founder of a domestic terror group, as though Obama had just emerged from the Tora Bora mountains with a \"Vote for Bin Laden\" sign under his arm. </p> <p>Obama, she claimed, has been \"palling around with terrorists and launched his political career in the living room of a domestic terrorist\". \"This is not a man who sees America the way you and I see America,\" she told one crowd. \"I'm afraid this is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to work with a former domestic terrorist who had targeted his own country,\" she told another. </p> <p>The truth is that Ayers, who is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois and a former aide to the Chicago mayor, Richard Daley, lives a few blocks from Obama, donated $200 to his re-election fund to the Illinois state senate in 2001, and sits with Obama on the eight-person board of the Woods Fund, which supports low-income and minority groups on the South Side of Chicago. </p> <p>But in post 9/11 America, where fear often works better than truth, Palin certainly connected with her audience. Her rallies have taken on the air of lynch mobs, with supporters yelling \"Kill him\", \"Terrorist\" and \"Treason\" at the mention of Obama's name. Meanwhile, local officials introducing McCain have been emphasising Obama's middle name, \"Hussein\".</p> <p>Given that Hillary Clinton was the first to raise the connection between Obama and Ayers during the primaries, it is difficult for the Democrats to now claim it is off limits. But the Republican base, which has been in a rage for some time, has taken it to a whole new level. For six years the party controlled all three branches of the government. They slashed taxes, started wars and ignored international agreements at their whim. Eight years on America is poorer, weaker, and more isolated and vulnerable than it has been in several generations. They look around for someone or something to blame. As their own president is poised to nationalise the banking system, they hear Obama's name and reflexively scream \"socialist\".</p> <p>On Friday McCain had to pull them back from the brink. One man said he was \"scared to bring up [his] child in a world where Barack Obama was president\". McCain replied: \"He is a decent person that you do not have to be scared of as president of the United States.\" The crowd booed. Later a woman said she could not trust Obama because he is an \"Arab\". McCain grabbed the microphone from her before she could go on. \"No ma'am, he's a decent family man, a citizen, who I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\" The crowd applauded. </p> <p>The trouble is that if Obama is the man they say he is, then the crowd has every reason to be scared - after all, what decent family man \"pals around with terrorists\"?</p> <p>Indeed, ordinarily these attacks and McCain's agenda would work. But not in the middle of a stockmarket crash. People are more concerned with keeping their jobs than with being taxed in them; more focused on economic security than on national security; and they care more about their retirement accounts and homes than they do about Ayers - whom most have never heard of. </p> <p>It's not that the barely veiled racial slights don't resonate with some. It's that when faced with the question: do you hate black people more than you like your house, your job or your retirement account, for many the hurdle of racism does not seem quite so high.</p> <p>Nonetheless there are a few reasons why Obama should not be complacent. First of all, the election is not today. What has turned around in a month can turn back again. After the final debate in 2000 Al Gore was leading Bush by 11%; we all know how that turned out. Second, the polls may not be accurate. True, all of the last 30 polls show him ahead. But while nine give him a double-digit lead, 10 have him ahead by just five points or less - within the margin of error. In other words, it could yet tighten and probably will.</p> <p>But for now the fundamentals of his campaign are strong. And while McCain may keep trading in smears, for the time being no one seems to be buying them.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>ITV's big mistake in the build-up to Saturday's international was to include, in its 90-second montage of England moments since 1966, footage of the two Brians of blessed memory, Clough and Moore, in lively debate on the subject of Poland's 1973 goalie Jan Tomaszewski. It served to underline how unutterably dull TV football punditry has become. Despite ITV spicing up its Champions League cast of Steve Rider, Sam Allardyce and Andy Townsend with Graeme Le Saux (I'm joking), the 45 minutes of foreplay before kick-off against Kazakhstan rarely strayed far from the bleedin' obvious.</p> <p>I certainly do not need a former international footballer to tell me Theo Walcott has \"terrific pace\", or that Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard are \"top-class players\". What might have been illuminating would have been some sort of discourse on whether Fabio Capello's selection was over-cautious against limited opponents. At half-time, David Pleat noted that the replacement of the holding midfielder Gareth Barry with Shaun Wright-Phillips had liberated Wayne Rooney, enabling him to play in the middle, closer to Emile Heskey. But before the kick-off Capello's formation prompted barely a murmur of dissent.</p> <p>ITV was clearly pretty chuffed to be returning to big-time international football but that was no reason to reduce its analysts to the role of mere cheerleaders. Well done, though, to the channel for its restraint in waiting a full 22 minutes before making passing reference to Sacha Baron Cohen's Kazakh character Borat, and then playing only a very brief clip from the movie, giving the embassy no cause to get on the blower.</p> <p>It was another great comic character that ITV chose to whet our appetite for its return to the big stage, hiring Graham Taylor to front a documentary called England Expects, ostensibly an examination of the difficulties of managing the England football team, but actually a protracted whinge about the media, of which Taylor is, of course, now a part.</p> <p>Taylor flew to Mexico to meet one of his successors, Sven-Goran Eriksson. \"And you are?\" said Sven, as he continued to supervise the minor alterations to his mansion (installation of a full-length mirror and a throne). Sadly we never saw that bit, joining the encounter with the two former England gaffers on a sofa, Taylor smiling obsequiously and inviting Sven to join him in condemning the fourth estate. Interestingly Sven, who suffered far more press intrusion than Taylor, and managed to get beyond the early stages of major tournaments, was more relaxed about the issue, seeming to take the view that complaining about the media was like complaining about the weather.</p> <p>An interview with Glenn Hoddle, at a soccer school in Spain, was on similar lines. A graphic of headlines such as \"He Hod To Go\" and \"Hod Case\", demonstrating the rapier-like wit of the British press, preceded a short bout of tut-tutting, before our presenter flew off to Holland to meet Steve McClaren. Except he did not talk to McClaren, interviewing Johan Cruyff instead, presumably on the grounds that Cruyff does a better Dutch accent.</p> <p>Kevin Keegan and Terry Venables were also conspicuously absent from the programme, but Taylor did manage to entice three of his former inky-fingered tormentors to take part, entertaining them to an agreeable-looking lunch beneath the beautifully adorned ceilings of the Grade One-listed Crockfords of Curzon Street.</p> <p>Say what you like about the press - and, sure, we may have \"hod\" difficulty coming up with original puns during what Glenn would undoubtedly call his sacking situation - we are mindful of our duty to explain ourselves to the public, and if that has to take place in a restaurant where, according to the internet, \"the fine wine list has an excellent selection of wines from the \u00a325 to \u00a3325 price range\", so be it.</p> <p>Having dined well, my esteemed colleagues were inclined to apologise to the cheerful, clubbable Taylor for the root vegetable jibes, the irony being that, in the cutaways to the ever beaming former custodian of the nation's dreams, who has now put on quite a little weight, it was easier than ever to imagine him as a turnip. Taylor undoubtedly got a raw deal, but now he has joined the punditry gravy train, trousering decent fees for mouthing banalities that neither inform nor entertain, one's sympathy is diluted.</p> <p>Taylor was outraged that at the height of the media feeding frenzy, the press tried to force his wife into an interview. I would go further than that. I would put Mrs Taylor on the ITV panel.</p>",
  "<p>It was football's equivalent of Captain Edward Smith claiming to have sailed the Titanic brilliantly but for that bit of ice. Chris Iwelumo stood before the press and said that, yes, it was a bad miss, but remove his slice of infamy from the equation and his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/scotland\">Scotland</a> debut should be classed as encouraging. As his manager, George Burley, has discovered, it is not easy to convince when a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldcup2010qualifiers\">World Cup place</a> is at serious risk. </p> <p>The Wolverhampton Wanderers forward may have had a point, as his introduction and the change to 4-4-2 did wake Scotland from their slumber against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/norway\">Norway</a> on Saturday. But it would miss a far bigger one to give too much credence to his words. Iwelumo did not merely join Ronny Rosenthal and other unfortunates in the strikers' hall of shame when he prodded wide of an open goal after the Norway goalkeeper, Jon Knudsen, had failed to intercept Gary Naysmith's delightful cross - he left Scotland's World Cup qualifying prospects on a precarious edge, opened his manager to criticism that will intensify with the premature retirement of Kris Boyd, and produced what may prove the defining moment of Burley's campaign. With no competitive fixture until March and only four points from the opening three games in Group Nine, a long winter stretches before the Scots.</p> <p>Iwelumo preferred to accentuate the positives, having made his international debut at 30. \"We got a point, that's the positive way to look at it, and the performance of the boys was positive,\" he said. \"My own performance, if you take away the chance, was also positive; my link-up play and winning balls in the air. I thought my performance was good and if I scored it would have been the icing on the cake. It's just one of those things.</p> <p>\"People will talk about the miss and rightly so, it was a bad miss, and it was a crucial three points lost, but my miss didn't lose us the match and there are things to take forward to the next game. There is nothing to be embarrassed about. I'm going upstairs to see my daughter now and that will cheer me up. Family is the most important thing to me, I have two beautiful girls and the older one was here at the game. When I go upstairs, I'll switch off and have a bit of time to myself.\"</p> <p>If they had switched off the giant screens at Hampden then Scotland's second-half momentum might not have been completely lost. So astonishing was Iwelumo's miss that the assistant referee signalled for a goal before realising, along with a horrified home crowd, that the striker had heeled wide from three yards. Not even Scotland's players could avert their eyes as the incident was replayed several times, and Burley's men retreated into their shells until Kirk Broadfoot engineered late chances for Iwelumo and Steven Fletcher.</p> <p>\"It totally deflated us,\" said Craig Gordon, who, impressive in the Scotland goal, frequently thwarted John Carew and prevented Steffen Iversen snatching victory late on. \"The crowd didn't need to see that again and I'm sure we didn't. Everybody looked up at the big screen and saw it on a number of occasions. But it has happened now, he didn't manage to score and I'm sure he will come back stronger.\"</p> <p>Burley's decision to withdraw James McFadden and James Morrison and introduce Iwelumo and Fletcher, with one cap and no goals between them, rather than Boyd, with seven goals in 15 caps, was open to ridicule as soon as the Wolves man blundered. Having promised adventure, the Scotland manager instead oversaw a sterile, ponderous display until he showed bravery with that 56th-minute double substitution. But he did not get lucky and instead, with McFadden cursing in the dug-out and Boyd composing his notice to quit, the manager's problems have increased.</p> <p>\"I thought tactically I got it right,\" Burley said. \"I looked at it and changed it. If you don't change it and go for it then you can say the system didn't work but we got it right in terms of changing things and dominating the game. The first goal was crucial and we should have got it.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Scott Brown (Scotland)</p> <h2>The manifold perils of an open goal</h2> <p><strong>Ronny Rosenthal, September 19 1992</strong></p> <p><strong>Liverpool v Aston Villa</strong></p> <p>A goal looked certain as the Liverpool striker beat keeper Nigel Spink only to shoot against the bar from close range.</p> <p><strong>Jeff Astle, June 7 1970</strong></p> <p><strong>England v Brazil</strong></p> <p>How different might have England's World Cup turned out had Astle converted with just the keeper to beat?<br><strong><br>Nwankwo Kanu, November 14 2004</strong></p> <p><strong>West Brom v Middlesbrough</strong></p> <p>An unforgettable howler, the Nigerian somehow scooping the ball over the bar from almost directly under it.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Keegan, July 5 1982</strong></p> <p><strong>England v Spain</strong></p> <p>With time running out on England's World Cup on came Keegan - to spurn the clearest chance of the match, heading wide of an open goal.<br><strong><br>Christian Vieri, June 18 2002</strong></p> <p><strong>Italy v South Korea</strong></p> <p>Italy blamed defeat on poor refereeing.

  "<p>Charl Schwartzel won the Madrid Masters yesterday with a flawless five-under 66 to finish three shots ahead of Ricardo Gonz\u00e1lez at the Club de Campo course, and that despite nearly withdrawing from the tournament before the weekend.</p> <p>The South African admitted afterwards that a shoulder problem and a virus had made him think twice about competing, but he persevered following a telephone conversation with his father on Friday. \"I spoke to my Dad and he told me to tee off and see how I feel,\" he said. \"I haven't felt great. I had a shoulder problem and some sort of flu bug which has been going around - several other players on the Tour have had it. I've been waking up in the mornings feeling achy and sore and not having any energy, but this morning I actually felt a bit better and I'm glad I kept my swing going the way it has been the past three days.\"</p> <p>Gonz\u00e1lez, the Argentinian who shot a nine-under 62 in the third round, threatened in patches, while Spain's Pablo Larraz\u00e1bal produced two early birdies but could not find the spark that ignited his nine-under 62 on Saturday. A 67 saw him finish third on 15 under.</p> <p>The 7th hole was the turning point in the battle between Schwartzel and Gonz\u00e1lez. The former hit his second right of the green but produced a controlled chip out of the trees to within three feet and sank the putt for birdie. Gonz\u00e1lez, however, had a five-footer for birdie which slid wide, allowing the South African to go three ahead.</p> <p>England's Robert Rock launched a barrage of birdies on his way to a 64 and a tie for fourth place. \"My goal was to finish in the top 10 and it's great,\" he said. \"I'll have to check if I've secured my [Tour] card. Next week is also important but if I play half decent, I'll get it done.\"</p>"
