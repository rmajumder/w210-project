  "<p>The slightly fey title belies the power of this impressive novel. Mark Blum, a New York architect in his early 60s, is diagnosed with a brain tumour. He chooses to return to his native Glasgow to die. Younger brother Dan, a photographer who was in his youth a talented pianist, undertakes to look after him. In London, children's book illustrator Anci Goldman learns of Mark's death through a newspaper obituary. Anci, a refugee from the Hungary of 1956, had briefly lived in Glasgow, at the home of the Blums. Moving through three narratives with a sharply defined sense of place and history - New York at the dawn of this millennium, London and Glasgow during one mournful autumn, and besieged Budapest - Woolfson has created a brooding, intelligent work replete with ideas and gripping drama.</p>",
  "<p>The Daily Mail is in many (no, most) respects a dreadful paper, relentlessly stoking the worst human emotions: prejudice, bigotry and hate. Yet most journalists will forgive its sins because its owners and management still, in their twisted way, care about journalism. Most of all, they will forgive it for nurturing Dame Ann Leslie, one of the great foreign correspondents of her generation. </p> <p>Leslie, now in her late 60s, is no Pilger or Fisk, exposing the failings of Anglo-American imperialism. Though she admits to having been \"faintly leftwing\" in the 1960s - and being \"bowled over\" by Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch - her politics, as befits the daughter of an oil executive, born in British-ruled India, have long been conventionally conservative. In Haiti, she listens \"to the distant staccato sounds of the poor killing the poor in the interests of the rich\", and gets her back pain treated (apparently successfully) by a voodoo priest. But she has nothing to say about how, for decades, American capital shamelessly exploited the island. We learn about the victims of communist and Islamic regimes, but there are no encounters, in this book at any rate, with the victims of Anglo-American bombing or CIA-inspired coups or rapacious western corporations. She's kind about George W Bush - excepting his use of the death penalty to enhance his electoral prospects, a failing he shared with Bill Clinton - and she supported the invasion of Iraq (unlike her employers at the Mail). She excoriates Islamists while treating America's Christian fundamentalists as, really, just a laugh. </p> <p>Yet her empathy with the \"anonymous, broken people who once lived and breathed and sweated and laughed like me\" never flags. In Bosnia, passing an abandoned caravan beside the road, she sees knickers, blouses, tights and underpants on a washing line, rigged up between blossom-covered apple trees. The family members evidently didn't have time to collect them before they fled. (The image is a bit of a cliche, perhaps, but this is a reporter who survived the virtual extinction of foreign reporting in mass-market newspapers.) She doesn't tell us who might have been ethnically cleansed by whom, but it doesn't matter. As she forcefully points out elsewhere, Muslims as well as Serbs were guilty of murder and forcible expulsion. Human suffering is indivisible. </p> <p>Leslie's prime mission is to find out what life is really like for people in situations of extreme conflict and stress, whether they are women in the Middle East, Shia in Iraq, Palestinians in Bethlehem or lovers in Maoist China. Nobody would ever accuse her of lacking either ingenuity or physical courage in reaching her targets, despite a \"fragile immune system\" which now requires daily antibiotics. A woman in such situations has an advantage over men, she argues, because she can use her garb to assume different identities, as a bird-brain or an imperious Lady Bracknell, according to circumstances. Confronted by male immigration officials or security apparatchiks, she should carry a handbag full of detritus and, in a search for the correct papers (which of course she hasn't got), empty the contents, including bits of make-up, family snaps, spare tights, recipes and so on, on the bureaucrat's desk. Exasperated by an apparently twittering, disorganised woman - in developing countries, officialdom usually has a low opinion of the female sex - he will conclude she is harmless and wave her through. </p> <p>Leslie's special talent is for interspersing her stories with telling details like that. This book is adorned by the anecdotes with which she has entertained parties, lunches and radio programmes for years. </p> <p>My favourite, told by Leslie in her hoarse, gravelly smoker's voice, was the one about the Serb hospital ward where wounded men were greeted with \"a fag shoved into their mouths\". Only in the operating theatre was smoking forbidden, explained the surgeon, not because ash might drop in the wound - \"ash is sterile\", he said - but because he couldn't see to operate through a fog of smoke. The tale appears here in slightly different form from the one I first heard. Most journalists' stories improve in the telling, and no doubt this is true of how Leslie punched Mohammed Ali on the jaw when he wouldn't pay attention to her; how the Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi sang a lullaby when Leslie was seized by violent fits of vomiting during an interview; and how Margaret Thatcher said she needed to visit the lavatory only twice a day, once in the morning, once in the afternoon. </p> <p>This is a vivid, absorbing book which, like Leslie's best journalism, conveys what it's like to live through wars, civil conflict, oppression and historic change. Unlike some journalists' memoirs, it's free from long encomiums to editors and colleagues and from boozy recollections of Fleet Street's supposedly halcyon days. Reading it, you might even forget that the author works for that dreadful paper.</p>",
  "<p>In 1520 the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes and his men landed in Mexico. The cities and artistic treasures they found there astounded them, and golden, feathered, and turquoise objects presented by the Aztec empire to Cortes as tribute were sent back to Europe where they inspired awe and respect. The retired soldier Bernal D\u00edaz, writing in his old age about his youthful adventure with Cortes, still remembered the art of the Aztecs with reverence: he thought the craftsmen of the New World equalled \"Apelles of old, or\u2026 Michelangelo.\" The German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer, who saw the tribute, was similarly impressed: \"I marvelled over the subtle ingenuity of the men in these distant lands. Indeed I cannot say enough about the things which were there before me.\" </p> <p>Many of the objects presented to Cortes were melted down \u2014 in spite of D\u00fcrer's praise \u2014 for the gold. But objects such as a blue curling serpent with two heads, its body covered in tiny tiles of precious turquoise stone, survive from that Conquistador treasure. Other Aztec masterpieces have been excavated in Mexico City, which stands on top of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan. There are even manuscripts with Aztec history and myth painted by Aztec artists, like the Codex Borgia. And all these treasures confirm that Aztec art on the eve of the Spanish conquest of central America was a sophisticated triumph of craft and imagination. Realistic, sensitive sculptures such as a recently rediscovered life-sized terracotta eagle warrior; terrifying skull masks incorporating actual human skulls; sacrificial daggers and massive stone vessels to hold human sacrificial victims' blood \u2014 this is sensational stuff. </p> <p>Sanguinary as the Aztec empire was, it created a superb civilisation. Tenochtitlan was a vast city with great monuments. An intricate sense of time and accurate calendar were inherited by the Aztecs from earlier central American civilisations, and this tradition is powerfully embodied in the famous Calendar Stone with its monster head at the heart of a geometrical explosion of radiating circles and triangles. </p> <p>Renaissance Europeans were quite capable of recognising its brilliance \u2014 but it made no difference to their behaviour. The Aztec empire was eradicated by the gold-obsessed, religiously intolerant invaders who went on hacking their way deeper into the continent. In 1531 Francisco Pizarro began the conquest of Peru. The Inca empire, a recent creation like that of the Aztecs in Central America, ruled the Andes. Here too the invaders found a complex urban civilisation with its own majestic art and architecture \u2026 and brutally crushed it. The Inca city of Machu Picchu, spectacularly poised on a rock among vertiginous green peaks, was not rediscovered until 1911. The Inca artists responded deeply to the grandeur of the Andes: at Machu Picchu, the Sacred Rock at the northern end of the site is carved to mimic the shape of a mountain peak directly behind it. The Intihuanta Stone at the city's highest point connects earth, sky and sun. Many Inca works were melted down by the Spanish, but their enigmatic rock carvings and landscape works survive \u2014 even some of their intricate field terraces on Andean mountainsides seem to have been created not for functional purposes, but as landscape art.</p> <h2>Key works</h2> <p>\u2022 Aztec: two-headed serpent decorated in turquoise mosaic, now in British Museum (c1400-1521)<br>\u2022 Aztec: sacrificial knife with mosaic handle, now in British Museum (c1400-1521)<br>\u2022 Aztec: mask made from human skull, now in British Museum (c1400-1521)<br>\u2022 Aztec: Calendar Stone, now in National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City (c1400-1521)<br>\u2022 Aztec: life-size statue of young eagle warrior, now in Museum of the Great Temple, Mexico City (c1400-1521)<br>\u2022 Inca: rock sculpted in shape of a mountain, Machu Picchu, Peru (c1450)<br>\u2022 Inca: Intihuatana Stone, Machu Picchu, Peru (c1450)<br>\u2022 Aztec: grotesque sculpture of the goddess Coatlicue, now in National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City (c1470-1521)<br>\u2022 Inca: silver figure of sacrificed child, now in Museo Regional de Atacama, Chile (c1500)<br>\u2022 Aztec: Codex Borgia, illuminated manuscript now in Vatican Library (c1521)<br>\u2022 Aztec: Codex Mendoza, illuminated manuscript now in Bodleian Library (c1550)</p>",

America's forests are full of reptiles, but this one is different. Its vast green body is half a kilometre in length, its head a massive tumulus. It is an earthwork serpent, one of the most spectacular ancient monuments in the Americas. At first sight it's tempting to compare it to the earthworks and barrows of neolithic Europe, and in fact there are burial mounds in Ohio that are as old as Stonehenge. But the builders of the Great Serpent Mound were doing something different from Europe's megalith-builders \u2014 they were drawing a picture to be viewed from the sky. Nor is it the only such sky-picture in the Americas. </p> <p>Thousands of miles to the south is to be found the most mysterious American work of art of all. The Nazca desert in Peru has a geological peculiarity \u2014 it is composed of a thin layer of dark stones on top of lighter-colour stones. The Nazca, who flourished here in the first millennium AD found that by brushing away the dark stones, they could \"draw\" white lines in the earth \u2014 and they did this on a colossal scale, over hundreds of years. The Nazca Lines are immense earthworks created in this simple communal way. The mystery is: why would an ancient people make vast drawings of birds, a killer whale, a monkey, lizards and a human figure, not to mention the abstract lines and shapes that got their works the name \"Lines\", all of which are visible only from the sky? They must have been addressing something in the sky \u2014 not aliens in flying saucers, as some suggest, but their gods. And what they showed their gods were symbolic animals: a serpent in Ohio, birds, reptiles and whales in Peru. This preoccupation with animal \"totems\" makes the earthworks deeply American. Such animal imagery is connected with shamanism \u2014 the belief that a questing holy man can gain access to the powers and knowledge of animals on a hallucinatory night journey. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338934165\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/21/part1q.jpg\" alt=\"1000 artworks: Colossal stone head, La Venta archaeological site, Mexico (1st millennium BC)\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colossal stone head, La Venta archaeological site, Mexico (1st millennium BC).

What is primitive and what is sophisticated? The urban peoples of ancient Mexico played a ball game in which losers could be sacrificed and the ball might be a human head \u2014 but the evidence for this consists of great works of art.

  "<p>The Roman empire did not fall in the fifth century; in the east it survived until 1453. That was when Byzantium, the new capital of Rome's emperors when Italy and Gaul became impossible to defend, finally fell to its Turkish besiegers. For a millennium after the death of the western empire Byzantium was shielded by its fortifications and secret weapons, including the lethal incendiary weapon \"Greek fire\". From the Byzantine point of view the city was not a last retreat of empire but an eternal and enduring civilisation \u2014 and Christians and Muslims alike accepted its cultural supremacy. Byzantine mosaicists were sought after to decorate the most prestigious palaces, mosques and churches across the mediterranean world.</p> <p>Byzantine art does not share western Christendom's preoccupation with the suffering Christ. Far from being nailed to a cross and mourned by his weeping mother, the typical Byzantine Christ in the mosaics of Haghia Sophia or the Church of the Dormition is enthroned, either as a child sitting bolt upright on his mother's knee or as ruler of heaven. This art is mystical: it is not a storytelling art so much as a spur to meditation on dreamlike spiritual forms.</p> <p>It is a myth that the European Renaissance was started by refugee Byzantine scholars after the city's fall in 1453. Far from imitating Byzantine art, Italian artists in the 15th and 16th centuries rebelled against its influence. Their acute realism was a rejection of all that abstract gold. With the rise of modernist abstraction in the 20th century, the art of Byzantium was once again admired. For WB Yeats in his poem Sailing to Byzantium this is the quintessence of an art that does not take its form \"from any natural thing\u2026\" </p> <h2>Key works</h2> <p>\u2022 The Transfiguration, mosaic in the church of the Monastery of St Catherine, Mount Sinai (548-565)<br>\u2022 The Virgin and Child enthroned between St Theodore and St George, icon from Constantinople, in the Monastery of St Catherine (6th or 7th century)<br>\u2022 St Peter, painted icon from Constantinople, in the Monastery of St Catherine (6th or 7th century)<br>\u2022 Mosaics in Hagios Demetrios, Salonika (Thessaloniki), Greece (7th century)<br>\u2022 Mosaics in Haghia Sophia, Istanbul (9th century)<br>\u2022 Christ Pantocrator, mosaic in the dome of the Church of the Dormition, Daphni, near Athens (c1100)</p>",
  "<p>The hotel checked in a few days before I did. While I arrived on the tiny island of Kl\u00e4desholmen in classic Swedish style - driving a Volvo over a bridge - the new Salt &amp; Sill was being towed into the harbour on Sweden's west coast behind a tug boat.</p> <p>The country's first floating hotel sounds gimmicky and an excuse for bad jokes about the earth moving. But ineffably cool Sweden is, of course, far too classy for tasteless novelties. The floatiness is purely functional: it sits on the water because there was no more room in the fishing village and diners at Salt &amp; Sill's restaurant were craving a place to sleep after feasting on herring and schnapps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338957085\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/23/SaltSilli.jpg\" alt=\"Salt and Sill floating hotel, Sweden\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Patrick Barkham</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Barkham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Its stark modern lines a sharp contrast to the traditional red fishing huts and houses, Salt &amp; Sill's hotel might have sailed down from outer space. It was actually built on the neighbouring island of Tj\u00f6rn before being floated into place. Given that its 23 rooms opened only this month - the day I turned up - you might expect a degree of chaos, but there was something instantly calming about it.</p> <p>Unlike the flat waters of Sweden's Baltic coastline, the west coast is wild and rocky; its barren humps of granite look as if the ice age has only just retreated. There are islands off islands off islands, and the hotel, too, is another little island. Its threshold is water and you cross a wobbly bridge to reach your room. Despite arriving too late for any schnapps, I felt drunk when I visited the bathroom in the night. Then I realised I was swaying only because the whole hotel was being nudged by the ocean current which sweeps into the harbour (and powers a turbine beneath the hotel to provide all its heat).</p> <p>An hour's drive from Gothenburg's City airport, Kl\u00e4desholmen is a proper working harbour. Its large fishing sheds make it the herring capital of Sweden - most of the country's catch is landed here. When Susanna Hermansson came to the island looking for a summer house for her husband's parents nine years ago, she bought a small restaurant instead. The family called their slightly accidental venture Salt &amp; Sill (\"sill\" is herring in Swedish), and served seafood straight from the fishing boats every summer. \"There are not many restaurants that have herring on their specials boards,\" says Hermansson. \"The Swedish love herring but we eat it only at Christmas, Easter or midsummer - every time we celebrate something. We thought we must teach people to eat herring all year round.\"</p> <p>In the morning I was woken by the lonely \"peww\" of gulls and the sun rising over the water. I padded around my floating room, its wooden floors soft as velvet beneath my feet. The rooms mix local granite, old wood from derelict fishing huts and new wood stained with environmentally friendly treatments. Their chic minimalism is, once again, functional as well as aesthetic: the hotel had to watch its weight to make sure it would float.</p> <p>Refreshed by a breakfast of pickled herring gently flavoured with blackcurrants (there are yoghurts and hot English options, too), I took a small orange-coloured car ferry to the island of Flat\u00f6n for a \"lobster safari\". Surrounded by yellowing leaves of aspen and silver birch was Handelsman Flink, a hotel and restaurant that takes its name from a local shopkeeper. The famous Swedish folk singer Evert Taube lodged in a room behind Gustaf Johansson's counter for a few years in the 1940s and named Johansson \"Flink\" (\"quick\" in Swedish) because everything took so long in his sleepy shop.</p> <p>The small fishing boat piloted by Niklas Krafft was genuinely quick but Handelsman Flink's head chef had to cut its speed when we hit a monster swell. This was a working trip to catch our own lobster supper in the cold coastal waters which slow the lobsters' growth and make them particularly tasty. Krafft's pots lay on the sea bed 20m below us, and as the boat lurched in horizontal rain, we - a group of six - had to lean over the edge and haul them up.</p> <p>It was heavy work and the first pot held nothing. Krafft's face darkened - it was raided not by the seals which pop up everywhere but by another fisherman. Lobster currently fetches a tantalising Skr1,000 (\u00a380) a kilo and lobster piracy is a growing problem - strangely reassuring when everything in western Sweden appears preternaturally perfect. I hauled in the second pot. Inside was my shiny black pal Lobby, who waved one claw reproachfully at me. A Swedish passenger whipped out a hip flask to \"celebrate the catch\". Burning scotch and a heaving sea was not an ideal recipe for hunger but my appetite recovered back at Handelsman Flink.</p> <p>Then Krafft handed Lobby to me and motioned to his cauldron of boiling herb-filled water. Lobby eyeballed me. Sorry, old friend. I cast him into the scalding abyss where he died instantly, and turned a brilliant red. Krafft showed us how to remove flesh from lobster claws before disappearing to prepare it while we enjoyed a sauna and Jacuzzi. The fresh lobster was slightly sweet and aromatic to taste and was followed by a delicious main course of monkfish crowned with a claw of lobster flesh.</p> <p>The sign of a good fish supper is when a fish lunch the following day does not repulse you. Back at Salt &amp; Sill, I idly watched a white jellyfish tentacling its way through the blue-black water like a plastic bag with purpose, before tucking into matjessill (herring) and other pickled herrings served cold and variously flavoured with mustard and smoked whiskey or apple, chillies and vanilla. These were served on a traditional wooden tray, alongside warm new potatoes and a sour cream called gr\u00e4ddfil, washed down with the restaurant's own lemon and dill flavoured schnapps or beer from Grebbestad - famous for its oysters - further north.</p> <p>My final afternoon was spent visiting the lonely iron-age stone circles of Pilane and the excellent Nordic Watercolour Museum (0046 304 600080, <a href=\"http://www.akvarellmuseet.org\">akvarellmuseet.org</a>) in the well-heeled village of Sk\u00e4rhamn on Tj\u00f6rn island. The even more well-heeled town of Marstrand was a good stopping point when I turned, reluctantly, back towards the airport. Its steep little streets are usually exceedingly well-trodden but it was pleasantly deserted off season and offered fine views from the formidable fort constructed by the Swedish king Carl X Gustaf in the 17th century to repel the Danes. It is not surprising that this magical coastline was so fiercely fought over.</p> <p>\u2022 Ryanair (<a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">ryanair.com</a>) flies to Gothenburg from Stansted, Glasgow and Dublin.

  "<p>Few tears have been shed for bankers in their City and Canary Wharf towers, the authors of their own downfall - and maybe ours too. And threats that without their bonuses, British bankers would brain-drain to Shanghai or Dubai now ring hollow. \"The catastrophe in financial services has been so complete,\" says Linda Jackson, director of outplacement provider Fairplace.</p> <p>Yet while many workers in other sectors enjoy emotional ties to their places of work, the City marches to a different beat. Those hired, fired, used and abused by the banks and investment houses seem to passively accept their treatment as just part of the deal. Nothing personal. Just another transaction.</p> <p>We talked to three former bankers who have discovered a happier life beyond the City; two graduates who are hoping banking wasn't a career mistake; and a cleaner wondering if his next shift will be his last.</p> <h2> The banker</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338971709\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/10/24/YuenSinibaldi220.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Yuen\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Christine Yuen</strong>, 29, had worked for HSBC since the age of 17 - working her way up from a cashier in Canada to corporate banking account management in Canary Wharf. But in May this year she was made redundant. </p> <p>\"I wasn't passionate about banking; it was a safe job with a pay cheque, a good environment and benefits,\" she says. \"But I knew nothing outside banking so felt my world had fallen apart.\"</p> <p>Yuen had an idea for a lifestyle management business, Zentime Living, but admits she would never have had the courage to quit her job to pursue it. \"But when the door shut on me, I thought, this is it. Out of my savings I've invested \u00a31,000 on legal and accountancy advice and my website. I'm my own boss now and have two contractors.\"</p> <p>Now her target clients are City lawyers or corporate and investment bankers. \"I'm targeting me in my old job!\" she says. \"I felt so swamped with tasks as a corporate banker I had no time for any domestic tasks; you worked 12- to 14-hour days and barely had time even for lunch.\" </p> <p>Zentime, says Yuen, runs errands, organises plumbers and arranges holidays - \"we're like personal assistants or concierges\" - as well as providing admin support for small companies such as boutique hedge funds. </p> <p>\"There are a lot of busy people in the City who are dedicated to their careers and who lack time for their personal agenda. And now they will be even more focused on their jobs, under greater pressure to be productive in this credit crisis.\"</p> <h2>The cleaner</h2> <p>On Monday September 14, <strong>Antonio Diaz-Mengivar</strong> picked up the papers, books and personal effects that Lehman Brothers' sacked workers didn't take away in cardboard boxes.</p> <p>Diaz-Mengivar, 49, has worked at the Lehman Brothers building on Canary Wharf for five years but only begins his day's work in the evening. From Monday to Friday, 9pm to 6am, Diaz-Mengivar and a colleague empty bins and pick up litter on 12 of the building's 31 floors. \"It's a lot of back bending,\" concedes Diaz-Mengivar. \"And we are worried, because we do not know what is happening with our jobs. I have spoken with the security guards and they do not know what is happening either.\"</p> <p>The collapse of Lehman's on Wall Street and at this gunmetal-grey building on Bank Street was the trigger for an \"extraordinary, almost unimaginable, sequence of events\", the governor of the Bank of England said this week. </p> <p>As Diaz-Mengivar leaves work for his second job - a 6.30am to 11.30am shift cleaning a Leicester Square theatre - he is still met by a crush of commuters. But he says he now sees worry in those faces, each wondering if their job will be next. The fundraiser dressed as a chicken at the tube station is finding it tougher to fill his bucket for orphans. Winter has come early to Canary Wharf. </p> <p>Nomura, the Japanese bank that has taken on some of the 1m sq ft rented here by Lehman Brothers, will employ 2,500 of the American bank's 4,500 employees. But Diaz-Mengivar and his 30 colleagues have yet to learn of their fate. They are employed by Lancaster Cleaning Company, which is owned by business services giant Rentokil Initial and provides daily cleaning and maintenance services to Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston and Swiss Re, among others. \"I like my job,\" says Diaz-Mengivar. \"And I am too old to start a new job.\"</p> <p>It's said that, typically, the Lehman Brothers' basic salary was about \u00a360,000 before bonuses. Diaz-Mengivar earns \u00a37.20 an hour. How did he feel watching, on TV at home, the bank's sacked employees leave for the last time? He shrugs his shoulders. \"I felt very sad for them. We all need to work.\"</p> <p>He says he does not know when he will receive his 25p an hour bonus. Lancaster is a \"living wage employer\", but has yet to start paying workers the new \u00a37.45 living wage set by London mayor Boris Johnson. \"I make only enough money to pay rent and buy food,\" says Diaz-Mengivar. \"I need the second job so I can send money to my mother in Madrid.\"</p> <p>Canary Wharf cleaners were among the first to benefit from the living wage campaign. Next week campaigners will target Whitehall. \"If the government can find \u00a350bn to bail out bankers, they can find \u00a35m to pay their own cleaners and security guards a living wage,\" says Neil Jameson of London Citizens.</p> <h2>The private banker</h2> <p><strong>Adam Honey</strong>, 42, was a private banker at Merrill Lynch looking after client relationships with wealthy individuals and their investment portfolios. Just as the dotcom bubble was bursting and stock markets were tumbling, Honey met the firm's New York senior management to be told he was the future of the company. </p> <p>\"I flew back on the Sunday night and on the Monday morning walked into our London office to hear that I'd been made redundant,\" he recalls. \"By 10.10am I was literally out on the street. It's a numbers game, nothing personal.\"</p> <p>Honey says that he was offered a couple of banking jobs \"in the 50 to 100 grand bracket\" and was in a fifth interview for a job in Geneva when the bank chairman interviewing him took a phone call. \"He said, 'I'm sorry but we can't now offer you a position.' When I asked him why, he told me to go back to my hotel and switch on the television.\" The date was September 11, 2001. </p> <p>Deciding that \"I wanted my fate to be in my own hands\", Honey set up Mountain Leap Events to look after businesses entertaining clients on ski weekends. \"I've always been mad about mountain sports, so I was following my passion as well as my contacts.\" He sold his London flat and started out with a second-hand computer in a rented apartment in Chamonix.</p> <p>\"Now we're launching a short residential Alpine retreat for people facing exceptional changes of circumstances - redundancy, health issues, family, whatever. I was fortunate that Merrill Lynch was just a job for me. I live much more modestly than I did nine years ago, but much more happily.\"</p> <h2>The vice-president</h2> <p>For eight years <strong>Jonathan Hesford</strong>, now 43, designed, installed and supported real-time IT trading systems for Merrill Lynch in New York, rising through the ranks to become a vice-president on a nice salary that bought his family a comfortable lifestyle. \"We lived just 500 metres from the World Trade Centre and on September 11 I saw both planes hit and had to run from our apartment with our one-year-old,\" he recalls. \"Merrill Lynch lost so much money in the disaster I was made redundant; my visa was tied to my job so we returned to England, and decided that what had happened was a good catalyst for making a change.\"</p> <p>Confessing to being a \"bit of a wine ponce\", Hesford and his wife dreamed of owning their own vineyard and winery. Hesford studied winemaking in New Zealand, taking a postgraduate diploma in viticulture and oenology, then worked as an assistant winemaker at Neudorf.</p> <p>\"We bought undervalued vineyard land in Roussillon in France, where you can buy old vines, small properties and character vineries - the skeleton of something up-and-running you can renovate. The work is varied with physical activity, outdoors working, the science and the art of it, and running your own business, creating labels and talking to customers. From banking I understand financing; and having been a project manager, I understand planning. Starting with pruning the vines and ending with selling the wine, it's a project cycle.\"</p> <p>At Domaine Treloar, Hesford grows Syrah, Grenache, Mourv\u00e8dre and Muscat grape varieties and produces 40,000 bottles a year which are sold locally, in the UK and in Germany. \"We're making a small profit, and that's all I'm looking for. We're building something permanent that can't be taken away - unlike the people in the City right now who are losing their jobs, bonuses, options and lifestyle all in one go. </p> <p>\"Though I miss the cut and thrust of banking, what I do now pays off twice as much as a lifestyle.\"</p> <h2>The graduates</h2> <p>Golden hellos worth thousands, fat bonuses every year, overseas travel, rapid promotion, all expenses paid ... plenty of reasons to consider a career in the City. Well, at least there used to be.</p> <p>With Lehman Brothers gone and job cuts at Citigroup, HSBC and Goldman Sachs, many recent graduates working in the financial services sector are beginning to wonder if they have made the right career choice. Graduate trainees were among those to lose their jobs when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. \"Some of them had only been there a couple of months before they were laid off,\" says Shuvo Loha, managing director of City headhunting firm Janikin Rooke.</p> <p>\"The atmosphere at work is not positive,\" admits one recent graduate who asked that he and his employer remain anonymous, because \"I don't want to imply that the company is screwed\". </p> <p>Although he still has a job in capital markets at one of the banks in Canary Wharf, he has seen many of his colleagues laid off and is worried about his own future. \"My department has taken a battering, and it's hard to see your colleagues disappear - you spend 14-hours a day with these guys and then they lose their jobs. And it could happen to me. The current crisis has shown me that anyone is dispensable. You stay loyal to your team, but when the shit hits the fan it counts for nothing - if they need to cut back, they'll get rid of you.\"</p> <p>University of Liverpool graduate Faheem (who does not want his surname to be revealed) was made redundant in the summer from an accounting role at a City bank, but he is trying to remain sanguine about the experience. \"It was difficult, but I'm seeing it as a chance to refocus on what I want to do. The job agencies told me that opportunities were drying up, so I thought I'd cut my losses, rent out my London flat and go back to live with my parents while studying for my next set of accountancy exams,\" he says. \"I'm confident that the market will pick up. At the end of the day, it's just a boom-and-bust cycle. That's just how the industry works.\"</p> <p>Many students who were considering a job in banking and finance will be having second thoughts about their plans, yet universities are still promoting City careers on campuses. \"Yes, we are still encouraging students to apply for the banking and finance sector,\" says Gill Frigerio, acting director of careers at the University of Warwick, \"but also to consider a wide range of other options such as consultancy or investment management.\"</p>",

  "<p>A Marxist revolutionary who kidnapped the US ambassador in a protest against Brazil's military dictatorship in 1969 is on the road to becoming Rio de Janeiro's next mayor.</p> <p>Fernando Gabeira still cannot get a US visa but he got a ringing endorsement from the daughter of Charles Elbrick, the diplomat he held at gunpoint for four days. \"I think it's fantastic,\" said Valerie Elbrick. \"I'm excited and fascinated by it. I'm certainly sympathetic with his party and with his views.\"</p> <p>The 67-year-old motorcycle-riding congressman favours legalising marijuana and gay marriage, and defends the right of prostitutes to safely ply their trade.</p> <p>If elected in tomorrow's runoff, Gabeira would join a growing number of former revolutionaries holding powerful government posts in Brazil. The president's social communication minister, Franklin Martins, also took part in Elbrick's kidnapping, and chief of staff Dilma Rousseff, a likely presidential contender in 2010, played a leading role in the armed resistance to the 1964-85 dictatorship.</p> <p>Like the others, Gabeira says he evolved from guerrilla to politician long ago. In an interview, he said armed revolution -like the dictatorships spawned by the Cold War across Latin America - \"is now behind us, in the last century\".</p> <p>Gabeira masterminded the 1969 kidnapping, dramatised in the 1997 film Four Days in September, starring Alan Arkin, which was based on a book Gabeira wrote. </p> <p>Elbrick died in 1983. His daughter, a writer who was 26 when her father was kidnapped, said she long ago forgave Gabeira after she learned of the brutality of Brazil's military regime.</p> <p>Gabeira and his group released the ambassador in exchange for 15 imprisoned leftists, but the US government still considers him \"persona non grata\" and he cannot get a US visa, a point the US embassy would not comment on.</p> <p>Gabeira is running as the Green party candidate against Eduardo Paes of the Brazilian Democratic Movement party, which is aligned with the Workers party of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. </p> <p>If elected, Gabeira has pledged to work to end the long-running violence in the city's slums, where renegade militias and police engage in combat against drug traffickers, and police invasions involving hundreds of officers firing at will have racked up civilian deaths.</p> <p>The United Nations estimates that the Rio police were responsible for 20% of last year's murders - killings typically registered as \"resistance followed by death\". The phrase is shorthand for extrajudicial executions, according to the UN.</p> <p>Gabeira also called for public works projects such as sewage systems to improve living standards for the poor. \"By having the state present in these communities we can bring about a transformation and we can eliminate the importance of the drug traffickers and the militias,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Wembley will host its second National Football League game tomorrow evening and most British eyes will be on one man. \"I'm very excited, it's my first time here,\" says LaDainian Tomlinson, the San Diego Chargers' star player and the best running back in the league. \"I've always wanted to come to London. No question, the London game last year had a big impact. Wembley was packed, it was like a play-off atmosphere. If you can't get ready for a night game under the bright lights on an international stage, you shouldn't be playing in the NFL.\"</p> <p>When the Miami Dolphins and the New York Giants contested the first regular-season game to be played outside North America last October, the NFL was quick to boast that it received half a million ticket requests. With the novelty factor wearing off, this year's tickets have not been in such high demand, but there will still be a capacity 83,000 crowd inside Wembley when the Stereophonics kick off the pre-game entertainment.</p> <p>On the back of last year's commercial success the NFL announced that at least one game would be played outside the United States in each of the subsequent four seasons. Like the Premier League's plan for a 39th game abroad, the declaration caused dismay among some fans and commentators, but Tomlinson claims there have been no complaints from his team-mates or their opponents and \"hosts\", the New Orleans Saints. \"Guys are excited,\" he says. \"It gives us a chance to get away for a little while and we get the week off after so it's fine. The NFL should be taking games outside the US. This is a sport that can be worldwide and that everyone can enjoy.\"</p> <p>The moneymen may have cashed in on their foreign excursions but last year's game was not enjoyable, a low-scoring affair played on a muddy pitch as the British weather lived up to its rainy stereotype. The NFL has compensated this time by selecting two of its most exciting and offensively potent teams, albeit teams that have thus far managed only disappointing 3-4 records this campaign.</p> <p>In Tomlinson, or \"LT\" as he is known, the NFL also has the perfect ambassador on and off the field. In recent years the league has been dragged through the mire with many players being arrested for serious crimes. However, Tomlinson, 29, represents the league's more marketable side, open, engaging, articulate and friendly. He credits this impressive character to his time spent at Texas Christian University, where he met his wife and finally earned his degree two years ago.</p> <p>\"I wanted to make sure I finished,\" he says. \"I went to college not just to play football but to get an education. My mum and my wife never let me forget, 'you said you'd get your education', and they were right. It's important because there are all types of opportunity that may come to you, and you always want to tell your children that you got your degree so that they have no excuses.\"</p> <p>Rather than succumb to the trappings of celebrity Tomlinson has used his fame to launch a charitable foundation. \"Our objective is to try to better a community of families through social and cultural awareness and education. We provide scholarships for high-school graduates, we have football camps for kids, a Thanksgiving drive where we give out turkey dinners for families in need, a toy drive at a children's hospital at Christmas. People may remember for a while what I do on a football field but they'll remember things we do to help them for the rest of their lives.\"</p> <p>The British fans are unlikely to forget Tomlinson's visit. It is easier to list the records the 2006 Most Valuable Player has not broken than the ones he has, his proudest moment being when he set a new mark for most touchdowns in a season, 31. His versatility stands him out from the huddle - despite being a running back he has completed eight throws in his career, seven of which have gone for touchdowns, and he was the first player to run, catch and throw for a touchdown in the same game. \"My strength is I do a lot of different things and don't really have a weakness per se,\" he says.

  "<p>Human behaviour does not settle easily into statistical categories; only birth and death can be counted as absolute. The incidents of daily life, products of personal choice or accident, are not easily defined or recorded. Even the best data, compiled honestly, will have flaws. The government's belief, for instance, that in mid-2007 the population of this country was 60,975,000 should be treated as what it is, an elegant estimate. The same caution should apply to this week's quarterly crime statistics, which produced wildly varied responses, although the overall trend was down. The problem is that politics does not readily admit to such complexities. </p> <p>There will always be good reason to question the numbers. Although British figures are better than most, they are also less trusted. Research in 2005 suggested that only 36% of people think official statistics are accurate and only 16% believe the government use them honestly, the lowest scores in the EU. Scepticism is greatest in areas of policy where people feel threatened, which is why crime and population statistics are so disputed.</p> <p>The Home Office was right to confess this week that errors by some police forces have made a mockery of official data on serious violent crime. Correcting the mistake saw incidences appear to rise by 22% above the same three months last year. The fault lay in the way some forces recorded violent incidents that did not cause injury: they have been doing it wrongly for a decade, out of ignorance, not malice, but the outcome is a small disaster for efforts to get the public to believe crime figures.</p> <p>Whether the new immigration minister Phil Woolas's all-fists-flying approach to his job will do anything to persuade people to trust migration statistics is uncertain. Since taking the job, he has given the impression that he wants to stop the UK population reaching 70 million. Official projections show it passing 65 million in 2016 and 70 million in 2028. \"People who are worried about increased population ... don't have to worry,\" he told the BBC yesterday. Mr Woolas argues that the new points system for non-EU migrants will reduce migration sharply. </p> <p>Well, it might. But Mr Woolas cannot know this for certain, since it has not come fully into force. Nor can he predict EU migration (which is not restricted) or do anything more than guess at the number of people leaving the country - 400,000 in 2006, against just under 600,000 who are thought to have arrived. British population and migration figures are no better than informed estimates. Counting people, just like counting crime, is harder than it sounds. When politicians make absolute declarations there is always reason to doubt.</p>",

  "<p>The Gambling Commission has announced a crackdown on the use of prize competitions to sell homes and has halted the draw for the \u00a31.1m Devon home featured last month in Guardian Money.</p> <p>Brian and Wendy Wilshaw have spent the past few months selling \u00a325 tickets to enter a prize competition to win their five-bedroom house - complete with 9.5 acres of woodland, a fishing lake and four holiday lodges.</p> <p>After selling 46,000 tickets they brought forward the draw date to last week. However, following a last-minute intervention by the commission, the scheme has been put on ice.</p> <p>They posted a message on their website this week saying: \"We have been asked to demonstrate why we believe that our question prevented a significant number of people participating in the competition - the main legal test to decide whether or not the competition is authentic rather than a simple lottery or game of chance.\" They are hoping it will go ahead as planned.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Gambling Commission has warned other homeowners that attempts to sell homes using prize competition schemes could potentially fall foul of the Gambling Act 2005.</p>",
  "<h2> B&amp;Q finally clears up the mess in your bathroom</h2> <p>I paid B&amp;Q \u00a34,445 in May 2007 for a bathroom upgrade. But I have suffered problems since it was fitted, including a blocked loo - caused because the toilet had been fitted in the wrong place. This was eventually fixed, but left gaps in the wall and ruined floor and wall tiles.</p> <p>I am not happy with the electric shower which makes a strange noise, or with the replacement floor tiles which do not match the others. This job is a total mess - can you get B&amp;Q to put it right?<br><strong>EW, Essex</strong></p> <p>You first contacted Capital Letters in June when your patience with B&amp;Q was already exhausted - unsurprisingly after a full year of hassles - and despite a \u00a32,000 goodwill refund from the DIY store in November 2007. </p> <p>Besides the problems you listed, others included a hole in the floor behind the toilet, a broken bath plug, bad grouting, lost hot and cold markers on the basin taps, and a musty smell due to a lack of ventilation.</p> <p>You have spent the past 18 months with a bathroom in disrepair - B&amp;Q could not even arrange someone to visit your home at a time convenient to you to look at the problem until Capital Letters sorted it out.</p> <p>It is really hard to understand why B&amp;Q, which was paid in full before starting the job (unlike many independent contractors who collect on completion), made such a mess out of a simple bathroom refurbishment.</p> <p>But after several months of Capital Letters dialogue with B&amp;Q, during which the store had said the matter had been completed to your satisfaction (it was not), you now have a sparkling bathroom. The repairs were so extensive that you had to move out of your home - B&amp;Q will pay the \u00a3330 hotel bill plus \u00a3100 in other expenses. </p> <p>It will write to apologise for the difficulties and send you a further \u00a3250 compensation (despite refusing earlier). B&amp;Q now has just \u00a31,800 or so left from your \u00a34,445 payment.</p> <h2>Cloned, then left cash and cardless </h2> <p>Three weeks ago, I paid \u00a3497 into my Abbey business account via an ATM. I was shocked to see my balance - which I expected to be around \u00a312,000 - was under \u00a32,000. I contacted Abbey customer services, who said my debit card had probably been cloned. I was assured it had been stopped and I'd get a new one immediately.</p> <p>A week later, and I was still cardless and \u00a310,000 down - only now the promised resolution is even further into the future. I was also told I could not withdraw my remaining money at a branch because it was a business account. Please help - I need some cash. <br><strong>PH, Lancashire </strong></p> <p>Why did Abbey not pick up the unusual spending pattern? Your card was used 32 times in 10 days - all in Australia including \"tests\" where tiny sums are stolen. But even after the fraud was detected, Abbey made life difficult, keeping you without cash.</p> <p>Abbey acted when Capital Letters intervened. It says its monitoring normally identifies unusual transactions but it did not notice the small amounts here. But this does not explain the \u00a31,800 paid to a Sydney plant hire firm. Nor does its statement deal with why you could not withdraw your remaining money. It says it could have done better. It will write to apologise - and send you \u00a3300 compensation. </p> <h2>Be warned, don't get caught up in chains</h2> <p>My mother is a semi-retired teacher of limited financial means, and I am concerned over her joining what she describes as a \"multi-level marketing\" plan called Success University. Can you throw some light on this. <br><strong>CG, London</strong></p> <p>This has nothing to do with any UK university. It calls itself \"multi-level\" but it would appear to be a pyramid scheme where earnings depend on recruiting others who have to sign up still more people. </p> <p>It was set up by \"30-year-old US internet millionaire\" Matt Morris. He claims earnings \"of over $100,000 a month\" provided you \"follow my simple step-by-step system\" based on \"affiliate marketing\". What are you marketing? Online self-improvement courses, but these are likely to be unread. The scheme is now in the UK where it's sold at get-rich-quick seminars. </p> <p>It costs \u00a375 to join plus a further \u00a325 a month. Where does the money go? It moves up the chain to those who signed your mother. But eventually all pyramid schemes collapse - the only winners are those who set them up. </p> <h2>Trying to get all square over my lost cube</h2> <p>In January I paid \u00a3150 for a furniture cube at New Heights. When it was delivered it was the wrong colour. It was taken away and never seen again. We now know the shop went bust but our attempts to contact the administrators have failed. We would like our money back so we can buy another - or even the wrong colour cube.<br><strong>SC, Nottingham</strong></p> <p>Your emails to insolvency practioners Baker Tilly bounced back as you misspelt Tilly as Tilley. But you would only have had bad news anyway. </p> <p>In returning paid-for goods, you passed ownership back to the now defunct store, but as you were an \"after sales customer\" there was no record of your goods or of your existence. So your cube - worth virtually nothing as a second-hand item - now belongs to the administrators. So you have lost your money just as you would if it had never been delivered - there is no bank style compensation scheme.</p> <p>The only good news is that your Abbey Visa debit card may be of some help (but don't rely on this). Baker Tilly will now send you paperwork so you can claim from your bank. </p> <h2>One parcel scam down ... another to go? </h2> <p>I received an email saying: \"Royal mail postal scam. This scam has been confirmed by our Royal Mail account manager and is especially relevant as Christmas is fast approaching.\" It then continues: \"A card is posted through your door from a company called PDS (Parcel Delivery Service) suggesting that they were unable to deliver a parcel and that you need to contact them on 0906 6611911 (a premium rate number). Do not call this number, as this is a mail scam originating from Belize. If you call the number and you start to hear a recorded message you will already have been billed \u00a315.\" <br><strong>CM, Middlesex </strong></p> <p>You are not the only one to send this to Capital Letters. It relates to a scam which was shut down three years ago but which seems to resurface every subsequent autumn. Regulator PhonepayPlus said this time last year that the \u00a31.50 a minute line had been shut in December 2005 and the Belize firm behind the scam fined. But at least, if a similar racket is set up this Christmas, you are warned in advance. </p> <h2>At 82, it's time to call off the debt collectors</h2> <p>I got into financial difficulties in 1997. Citizens Advice came to arrangements with my creditors. Some of these have now passed to debt collectors. Must I keep paying now I am 82? <br><strong>BH, Devon </strong></p> <p>Debt collectors only earn if you pay up - so it is unsurprising they hassle you. However, they cannot squeeze blood out of a stone. Tell them firmly that there is no money available and, if they wish, they can take you to court. They won't as they know they will get nothing - it might even result in your paying less than you do now.</p>",
  "<p>Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, confirmed a toughening of Labour's immigration policy yesterday by indicating for the first time that the government is to use its new Australian-style points-based system to restrict the growth in Britain's population. Woolas signalled the shift in emphasis during a BBC Today programme interview yesterday given to counter the accusation that he had been gagged by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, after his withdrawal from this week's edition of BBC TV's Question Time.</p> <p>The points-based immigration system, which has been phased in from April, has been advocated as a flexible way of responding to the changing labour needs of the economy. An independent migration advisory committee, packed with labour market economists, has been created to draw up a list of shortage occupations, alongside a forum to advise on the effect of migration on communities and public services.</p> <p>In yesterday's interview Woolas dismissed suggestions that he backed the Tory proposal for a cap on economic migration to Britain, but defended his controversial promise that the government would not allow the UK's population to rise as high as 70 million.</p> <p>\"We are introducing the biggest shake-up in immigration policy for 45 years ... that is based on the points system which allows the government to move the hurdles up and down - the criteria by which people can come into our country to work,\" said Woolas. \"That will allow us to control the population, to answer the worries that Frank Field and Nicholas Soames have been raising. That is not the same as a numerical cap. We don't think that is appropriate.\" Labour's Field and the Conservative Soames have been demanding a \"balanced\" immigration policy of one in and one out.</p> <p>Asked if he stood by his assurance that the government would not let the population rise from its current 61 million to 70 million or more, Woolas replied: \"Yes. The points-based system we are introducing allows governments to influence the numbers of people coming into the country to work, and there are other changes we are making.\"</p> <p>Woolas' tough line on population control has provoked outrage among some groups. It culminated yesterday at a debate at the University of Manchester when a female activist flung a custard pie at his face, scoring a direct hit. The stunned minister left the stage to clean himself up but later returned to the debate. The Manchester No Borders campaign group claimed responsibility for the stunt.</p> <p>The latest report from the Office of National Statistics shows a rise in the birth rate, particularly among foreign-born mothers in the UK. Immigration is playing a smaller role, with its contribution down from 72% in 2001 to 52% last year.</p>",
  "<p>It was a small but chilling symbol of 20th century consumerism. Obsessed with choice and convenience at any cost, supermarkets for years refused to put doors on fridges because they might get in the way of customers reaching in.</p> <p>Now a small but very 21st century revolution is under way. On Monday Asda will open what it claims is Britain's first superstore with doors on every freezer, fridge and chill cabinet. The initiative is part of a \u00a327m new \"low carbon\" store in Bootle, Liverpool, and this one measure alone is expected to save 8% of the building's electricity bill - and emissions. </p> <p>Asda is not alone. With electricity bills rising fast and campaigners and regulators turning up the heat on companies to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, supermarkets are opening ecostores to test a hotchpotch of improvements, from renewable energy to recycling plastic bags into kerbstones, animal-friendly products, and seeking out the green pound of more environmentally-friendly shoppers. </p> <p>With tens of millions of shoppers a week and \u00a385 out of every \u00a3100 spent on food in the UK, the supermarket chains could be a force for transforming the way people shop and encouraging suppliers around the world to reduce energy use, waste and exploitation of people and land. \"It's a healthy competition which is moving us all faster and faster,\" said Katherine Symonds, Tesco's sustainability manager.</p> <p>Others claim the very notion of an \"ecosuperstore\" is a contradiction in terms. \"While green technology can improve the environmental footprint of a building, this is a small part of a supermarket's impact, which includes emissions from food freight and customer travel to stores,\" said Helen Rimmer, campaigner for Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>Walking around the huge (recycled) brick and (sustainable) wood Bootle store, Bob Simpson, Asda's head of project development, pointed out two geothermal pumps to bring up hot water from underground aquifers and a wood pellet-burning boiler to help heat the store. </p> <p>Passing through wafts of warm bread from the bakery test on to a shopfloor busy with shelf stockers, Simpson showed off ventilators recycling \"ambient air\", sun pipes in the roof, and translucent bricks to bring in natural light but keep out the heat of the sun - and, of course, the omnipresent fridge doors. </p> <p>The fridge doors are, admitted Simpson, a leap of faith. At one store the electricity bill fell 14%, but in two sales dipped. \"I think here it will be slightly different, and that's why we've not changed them; also it's a bit late [to change] because we open on Monday,\" he said. </p> <p>The mantle of Britain's greenest supermarket changes almost monthly: in August Sainsbury's opened what it claimed was the greenest store in Dartmouth, Devon, promising to reduce emissions by 40%; Asda says Bootle will cut energy use and emissions by up to half; but Tesco claims to have already trumped that, with a 60% cut at Shrewsbury. </p> <p>Nor is carbon the only battleground: all the supermarkets have targets to cut the distance goods travel, emissions from vehicles, waste and a range of other unpopular byproducts of their business.</p> <p>One key driver has been rising electricity bills, which account for about 40% of store costs and 60% of the companies' direct emissions. \"We have seen a dramatic upturn in price that's changed the energy environment in the UK ... that's driving a totally different set of behaviours than even was the case two years ago,\" said John Ashford, head of engineering for Sainsbury's. </p> <p>The other is customers, though evidence that shoppers are lobbying for greener goods is hard to find, especially since the threat of recession.</p> <p>But supermarkets see green values as a way of winning or at least retaining customer loyalty, said Ronan Hegarty, news editor of The Grocer industry magazine: \"It's a bit of a trump card to say 'who's the greenest'.\" </p> <p>At the same time, retail bosses see the opportunity to use the cost savings to win more customers by bringing down prices, said Julian Walker-Palin, head of corporate policy for sustainability and ethics for Asda. \"Anything a supermarket does, we do for our customers. </p> <p>\"For 17 million people who shop [in Asda] each week, the majority don't understand climate change or carbon, and they don't want to. But they understand there's this issue we need to do something about; they very much [say to] their supermarket 'you have the experts, I want you to help me do the right thing',\" she said.</p> <p>The tension between sustainability and price-profit ethos has raised serious doubts about how much supermarket greening is greenwash. Critics point out there is only a handful of ecostores although all chains have less ambitious group-wide energy and emissions reduction targets.</p> <p>Fairtrade and organic products and local supplier deals make up a tiny fraction of total product lines and contracts.</p> <p>A host of other accusations are also levelled at supermarkets: bullying of suppliers, vast, oil-dependent freight networks, ruination of high street shops, millions of car miles driven by shoppers to out of town stores, promotion of unhealthy food, and the whole notion of trying to sell as many disposable consumer goods as possible. </p> <p>In what could be a turning point, Wal-Mart's chief executive, Lee Scott, this week said that on occasions the company might pay more for more sustainable products. \"We don't want to rule that out,\" said Walker-Palin. At the same time, Simpson admitted that if the fridge doors do act as a barrier to sales, some might be removed: \"It's about being brave, not stupid.\"</p> <h2>Targets</h2> <p><strong>Tesco</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Halve emissions from existing stores and distribution centres worldwide by 2020</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Halve greenhouse gas emissions per case of goods delivered worldwide by 2012 (compared with 2006)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Cut the number of carrier bags by 50% by the end of February 2009 (compared with 2006)</p> <p><strong>Asda</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce energy consumption of</p> <p>existing stores by 20% by 2012 and new stores by 30% by 2010 (compared with 2005)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send zero waste to landfill by 2010</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sell only 100% sustainably sourced fish by 2010</p> <p><strong>Morrisons</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce carbon footprint cumulatively by 36% by 2010 (from 2005)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce road miles travelled per pallet of stock by 6% by 2010</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 15% reduction in water use by 2010 (from 2005)</p> <p><strong>Marks and Spencer</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> UK &amp; Irish operations carbon neutral by 2012</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send no waste to landfill by 2012</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce carrier bag use by 33% by 2010 </p> <p><strong>Sainsbury's</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce CO2 emissions a square metre by 25% by 2012 (from 2005/06)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce CO2 emissions per case of goods transported by 5% by March 2009 (from 2005/06)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce waste sent to landfill by 50% relative to sales by 2012 (from 2005/06)</p> <p><strong>Waitrose</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduce carbon dioxide emissions for UK operations by 10% by 2010, 20% by 2020 and 60% by 2050 (from 2001) </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Reduction of 15% in energy-related transport CO2 emissions from stores deliveries by 2013 (from 2005) </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Recycle 75% of all waste by 2012 </p> <p><strong>Research by Holly Bentley</strong></p>",
  "<p>One evening in 2006, at a colleague's house, I met a friend of her teenage daughter. He was intellectually curious, and obviously bright - but implacably loyal to his parents' born again Christian faith. We spent pretty much the whole evening arguing with the poor boy, appealing to his logic and reason - all to no effect. There must, we despaired, be some seminal atheist text we could refer him to. We just couldn't think of one.</p> <p>But lo - ask, and ye shall receive. Not a month later, Richard Dawkins published The God Delusion, a scorching manifesto for secularism. Even by the standards of Dawkins' 1976 bestseller, The Selfish Gene, it was a spectacular success, with sales exceeding 1.5m. </p> <p>This week, as Dawkins retires from the Charles Simonyi professorship for the public understanding of science, the Oxford post he has held for 12 years, you might expect him to feel that the secular, scientific cause to which he has devoted his career is winning. On Tuesday, campaigners announced plans for an atheist advertising campaign to appear on the side of buses with the message: \"There is probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.\" The campaign, which was launched by TV comedy writer Ariane Sherine, blogging on Commentisfree.co.uk, hoped to raise \u00a35,500 from supporters, which Dawkins had pledged to match with his own money, but by yesterday public donations had already raised more than \u00a396,000. </p> <p>In the same week, immigration minister, Phil Woolas, predicted that constitutional reforms would banish bishops from the House of Lords within the next 50 years, and record numbers of new maths and science undergraduates were reported. Even in America, the religious right seemed to be losing its grip. </p> <p>But when I ask Dawkins, now 67, if he feels that public understanding of science has improved during his career, he looks doubtful. \"I would say that when my academic career began there was probably just as much ignorance - but less active opposition [to science]. If you were to actually travel around schools and universities and listen in on lectures about evolution you might find a fairly substantial fraction of young people, without knowing what it is they disapprove of, think they disapprove of it, because they've been brought up to.\"</p> <p>Does he attribute that to lower standards of scientific education, or to the rise of religious fundamentalism? \"Oh,\" he says without hesitation, \"I think it's due to greater religious influence.\" </p> <p>In Dawkins' view, there is a battle taking place in Britain between the forces of reason, and religious fundamentalism and it is far from won. He is one of its most famous and prolific combatants - but the question might be whether he is among its most effective. The God Delusion's stated aim was to \"convert\" readers to atheism - but he admits that as a proselytising tool it has broadly failed. \"Yes,\" he smiles. \"I think that was a bit unrealistic. A worthwhile aim, but unrealistic.\" </p> <p>In fact, Dawkins has been described as \"the biggest recruiter for creationism in this country\". Critics accuse him of an imaginative failure when it comes to human nature's susceptibility to the comfort of irrational thought. They say his intellectual intolerance alienates people, and have questioned his wisdom in attacking a target such as the comedian Peter Kay, for admitting to finding faith comforting. \"How can you take seriously,\" Dawkins notoriously scorned, \"someone who likes to believe something because he finds it 'comforting'?\" </p> <p>When Sherine approached him about funding for the atheist bus, the wording he preferred for the advert was \"There is almost certainly no God\". Wouldn't this just infuriate believers, and put off potentially sympathetic agnostics? In the end they agreed on \"probably\".</p> <p>\"Yes, yes, I know,\" Dawkins interrupts. \"I know. People say I'm shrill and strident.\"</p> <p>Dawkins has a theory about this, which is very persuasive. \"We've all been brought up with the view that religion has some kind of special privileged status. You're not allowed to criticise it. And therefore, if you offer even a fairly mild criticism, it really does sound strident, because it violates this expectation that religion is out of bounds.\"</p> <p>But even so, from a purely strategic point of view, why doesn't he therefore take more care to be ... </p> <p>\"Conciliatory?\" </p> <p>Well, yes. If people find the certainties of his intellectual style off-putting, why doesn't he try and make himself seem a little less intimidating</p> <p>\"Well, this is a thing that worries me,\" he says earnestly. \"Yes. And I meet it all the time. And it's by far the most intelligent criticism that I meet. I suppose there are two different ways of doing it, and I'm extremely happy if other people do it that way. Dan Dennett's Breaking The Spell at least sets out to do that, to be seductive - is that the word? Not quite, but to seduce the reader in. And I can do that. I know how to do it.\" He pauses to reflect. \"But I seem - I seem to have lost patience.\"</p> <p>In actual fact, though, he does take enormous care throughout the interview to be patient. Although he regards it as \"clearly wicked\" to call the child of Catholic parents \"a Catholic child\", he quickly adds, \"it's equally wicked to say this is an atheist child. I would never say that.\" He can't help adding, \"Of course, some people would say all babies are atheist, because they don't believe in anything.\" But when I ask if he'd say that, he considers for a moment before replying, \"Well, I'm not sure that's a very sensible way of putting it actually.\"</p> <p>Does he worry that the calibre of undergraduates is falling, as access to university is extended? \"I've got to be terribly careful not to sound like an old fogey here. When I first started tutoring in the 1960s it was a great joy to me, to get enthusiastic pupils who were really keen and interested and a tutorial would be a real meeting of minds and a real conversation. That good feeling about it seemed to gradually disappear. But I would hesitate to blame the students for that, it could be that I was just growing jaded.\" </p> <p>Like most rationalists, Dawkins tends to invoke people's innate intelligence, and attribute their flawed ways of thinking to ignorance rather than stupidity. \"But I don't have any evidence,\" he concedes. \"I could be wrong. It's a kind of ideal. It's a sort of bending over backwards.\" People might just be stupid, I suggest. \"They might be, yes,\" he agrees cautiously. \"But at least my saying that ignorance is no crime is my defence against the charge of arrogance. Because if you tell people they're stupid, that certainly isn't the way to win friends and influence people.\"</p> <p>Dawkins once described the British Airways employee dismissed for wearing a gold cross to work as having \"the stupidest face\". Did he regret saying it? A slightly naughty smile flickers over his face. </p> <p>\"Well ... well ... yes, I do really. Yes. That was an unguarded moment. Although I think I said stupid-looking. Did you see the photograph of her? I think if you look up the story, and they've got the photograph ... \" He checks himself, and stops. \"But this is unkind.\"</p> <p>Before meeting Dawkins, I'd worried that he might be so intellectually impatient as to be crushing. The impression instead is more like that of a lion who has given himself strict instructions to behave like a pussy cat - which is both a relief, and just slightly disappointing.</p> <p>Does he ever, I ask, envy people who believe in God? </p> <p>\"No.\" He shakes his head firmly. Even though faith is said to be so famously comforting? </p> <p>\"You see,\" he says, \"I'm so eager to say well maybe it is comforting but so what? I suspect that for every person who is comforted by it, there will be somebody else who is in mortal fear of it.\" Does he not envy those who manage not to find God mortally fearful? </p> <p>\"If I envied them that, then I'd have to envy people who are on some drug, which just makes them feel good. So to the extent that religion's comforting, it's probably not ...\" </p> <p>Dawkins likes to joke that old people go to church because they're \"cramming for the final\". He never worries that one day in old age he may wake and find himself feeling drawn towards faith, though. If he did, he would put it down to senile dementia. He seems much more worried about spurious reports of a fictitious deathbed conversion being put about by his enemies after he dies. He is probably not joking at all when he says \"I want to make damn sure there's a tape recorder running for my last words.\"</p>",
  "<p>We are, apparently, about to mark the 150th anniversary of the gin and tonic. I don't know how they know these things; I don't suppose that whoever invented it put a notice in the \"births\" column. Still, it's a chance to celebrate the most perfect of all mixed drinks. </p> <p>There is nothing in the world more refreshing than a g&amp;t, even on a cold day. It's what I always ask for at the start of long plane journeys - however tedious the prospect may be, the hit of the gin, the ice and the pick-me-up tonic makes the prospect of six hours in a seat designed for a contortionist gnome seem almost tolerable. I find two g&amp;t's doubles the effect. </p> <p>Everyone has their favourite. I like a new gin, Hendrick's, which is not cheap but has a dry, cucumber flavour. With most other gins I prefer a slice of orange to lemon. There's a lot of snobbery around the tonic. Obviously not diet tonic, which tastes like the effluent from a nuclear power station. </p> <p>Some people insist on prestige tonics, such as Fever-Tree, which I like well enough but is a little understated. For a real wallop you still need Schweppes. Some people say you should mix the drink half and half, though I think one part gin to two of tonic is more agreeable. You require a flat-bottomed tumbler and loads of ice, which doesn't dilute the drink as each cube helps keep the others frozen.</p> <p>Years ago I was in what was still Rhodesia, waiting for Joshua Nkomo to address a rally. He was hours late. The sun beat down and there was no shade whatever. I began describing to my colleagues the ideal, Platonic g&amp;t and evoked the clinking of the ice, the oily swirl of the gin, the faint blue blush of the tonic, and the beads of condensation on the glass. I am amazed I got out alive. </p> <p>My punishment later was that overnight the instant tan on my face peeled off like pork crackling, leaving the thin, wan skin underneath.</p> <p>\u2022 To Cheltenham for the literary festival. As I keep saying, cheap pleasures sell well in a recession, and for the first time ever they had sold 100,000 tickets - not at all bad for a 10-day festival. For instance, you could hear Michael Frayn speak for a small fraction of what you'd fork out to see one of his plays.</p> <p>He talked about Copenhagen, the one about Heisenberg and Niels Bohr, set obviously in the Danish capital. It was also called Copenhagen there (over the objections of their queen - can you imagine ours showing an interest in the title of anything but a horse race?) and he had been deeply moved by the production.</p> <p>The contrast with the German production was total. Frayn is a Germanophile, but, he said, most German theatres play the classics and little else, so the only way a director can make his name is by imposing his own original, sometimes bonkers vision. </p> <p>So Copenhagen was, grotesquely, set in a circus, with high wire cyclists and Heisenberg doing four somersaults - not metaphorical, but literal. \"Much of the play is long conversations about physics, politics and morality. Whenever one of them began, the actress playing Mrs Bohr would start hammering at an old typewriter, so loud that the audience couldn't hear a word. I suppose the director thought it was very boring.\"</p> <p>\u2022 I'm puzzled by the poster that atheists, inspired by Richard Dawkins and his book The God Delusion, have paid to put on the sides of London buses. Apparently so many people have sent money they can plaster the message on loads of them. (I wonder if devout people will refuse to ride on one, even if it's the last bus home.) Anyhow, the poster reads: \"There's probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.\" That's not atheism, it's agnosticism.</p> <p>But Dawkins tells us, quite angrily, that agnosticism is not an option. It's a cop-out. Saying \"I'm not sure\" is a lazy way of failing to face up to the real truth - there is no God, any more than there is a teapot in close orbit round the sun. So it's as if the Catholic church ran posters saying: \"Artificial contraception might on balance be a bad idea\", or the Wee Frees said: \"You will spend eternity in the fires of hell. Possibly.\"</p> <p>\u2022 I was sorry to see Levi Stubbs, the lead singer with the Four Tops, had died. I really thought they were the greatest of all Motown groups, better even than the Temptations, more thrilling than the Supremes, finer even than the Miracles, who were basically Smokey Robinson with backing singers. My favourite was their first big hit, Baby I Need Your Loving, in which Stubbs's voice, piercing and high, yet as thick and rich as a bottle of Madeira, soared up in a great cry of pain and yearning.</p> <p>I saw them once, at the Albert Hall. The singing was incredible, but the stage presence rather naff. They wore sharp, shiny suits, and waved their legs alternately, more or less in unison, like not very good synchronised singers. I suppose the contrast was meant to be with the popular white groups of the time, such as the Stones, whose image was wild and undisciplined. But the sound - it has never been matched.</p>",
  "<p>He had served in the army, either as a full-time soldier or as a reservist, for 22 years when he finally decided he wanted out. In 2003, Ari Folman, who had just turned 40, asked his commanders in the Israel Defence Forces to release him from the obligation to do a month's military service every year. They agreed - \"so long as you go to the army therapist and talk about everything you went through\".</p> <p>Folman, already an acclaimed film-maker and screenwriter whose service consisted of writing army information films - \"How to defend yourself from atomic attack, stuff like that\" - began to talk to the counsellor about the most dramatic episode in his military career and one of the most divisive chapters in modern Israeli history: the Lebanon war of 1982. Folman had been just 19. </p> <p>He realised that he had never spoken about the experience before. \"It's not that I had total amnesia about it,\" he says now, \"but I had worked very hard to repress those memories. I had the basic storyline, but there were large holes.\"</p> <p>Around the same time, Folman got a call from a friend, Boaz Rein Buskila, a fellow conscript in 1982. In a bar, the rain hammering outside, Boaz told Folman of a recurring nightmare: a pack of 26 vicious, slavering dogs stampede through a smart Tel Aviv street, upturning chairs, knocking over tables. The dream was connected to Lebanon, Boaz was certain. During the 1982 invasion, when an IDF unit tried to enter a village, their presence was often given away by the howling of dogs: Boaz, deemed too sensitive to kill a man, had been given the task of shooting any dogs on sight - to silence them in advance. He had killed 26, and remembered every one of them. </p> <p>The image had haunted Boaz. Surely Folman had similar memories, similar flashbacks from Beirut? No, Folman realised. Nothing at all. There were vast gaps in his memory - and he became determined to fill them.</p> <p>The result is one of the most extraordinary films of this or any year; it is already bagging prizes across the world and building an Oscar buzz. Waltz With Bashir is a documentary, yet it is animated. It tells a series of true stories, yet unspools like a hallucination. It is gripping, painful, and lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. It will surely take its place alongside The Battle Of Algiers and Apocalypse Now as among the very best films about conflict. For it wrestles with two of the great themes - memory and war - and dwells on the collision of the two. </p> <p>The form is startlingly original. The opening sequence - those hunting dogs - establishes a visual grammar, more graphic novel than kids' cartoon, that is sustained throughout. The figures do not move as they do in the Pixar movies that have raised a generation of children. Instead, they are still, \"cut-outs\" in which one limb might move while the rest remains static. The effect should be flat, but the low-tech style somehow conveys an emotional depth that catches you by surprise. The characters appear in two dimensions, yet are intensely human. </p> <p>Not least because their voices are real - not those of actors, but fellow veterans of the war interviewed by Folman. Indeed, it is Folman's voice we hear most often, and we see him in both his 19-year-old and 45-year-old incarnations. In the movie, he speaks to a half-dozen former comrades in arms, along with a therapist friend, a distinguished TV reporter who covered the 1982 war and an expert on post-traumatic stress disorder. It is one of the former soldiers who gives the movie its title: a man, apparently crazed after a long shootout at a Beirut junction, who grabs a weapon from a fellow conscript and begins to fire wildly, as if dancing to some internal music - the entire scene played out before a giant street painting of the Lebanese president-elect, Bashir Gemayel. </p> <p>The climax of the movie, and the heart of Folman's missing memories, is the massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. Enraged by Bashir's assassination, Christian Phalangist gunmen went on the rampage, murdering hundreds if not thousands of Palestinian men, women and children. (Estimates of the death toll range from 700 to more than 3,000.) Folman finally remembers that he was among the IDF men ordered to launch flares into the night sky over the camps. According to Israel's own Kahan commission of inquiry, the \"illumination\" was requested by the Phalangists to help them in their grisly work - though Folman is emphatic that at the time he and the soldiers beside him \"had no clue what was going on: we didn't know there was a massacre\". </p> <p>Those events prompted a bout of introspection in Israel that has rarely been equalled. An estimated crowd of 400,000 gathered in the centre of Tel Aviv to protest. Since that represented one tenth of the entire Israeli population, proportionally at least it can claim to be the largest political demonstration in any country at any time. Kahan found the then defence minister Ariel Sharon bore \"personal responsibility\" for the Palestinian deaths and concluded that he was unfit to serve in the defence ministry (though it did not stop him becoming prime minister 19 years later). </p> <p>All of this would have made compelling material in a conventional documentary, even a drama-documentary involving actors' reconstructions, but Folman never doubted that this film would have to be animated: \"There was no other way to do it, to show memories, hallucinations, dreams. War is like a really bad acid trip, and this was the only way to show that.\"</p> <p>Once you see the film, you know what he means: Carmi Cnaa'n recalls the boat ride that took him to Lebanon, how he threw up, how he then fell into sleep - \"I sleep when I'm scared\" - only to dream he was rescued by a voluptuous giantess, who held him like a nursing mother as she swam away from the vessel just seconds before it was bombed from the air. In a live-action movie, such a scene would have been impossible - or absurd. </p> <p>Driving the story is Folman's own quest to recover his memory, guided by his best friend-cum-therapist. Was the making of the film an act of therapy in itself? \"It was like scratching an old scar, an old wound,\" the director says, sitting in New York for yet another film festival, receiving another round of plaudits. \"The memories spurted out.\" </p> <p>And not only for him. Perhaps the most striking sequence in the film tells the story of Roni Dayg, today a lab chemist for an Israeli dairy company. Back in 1982 he was a tank loader when his unit came under fire. He and his comrades fled the tank, carrying no weapons, and were picked off, one by one, by Palestinian snipers concealed in the surrounding buildings. By the time Roni reached a rock and hid behind it, the rest of the men were dead. He waited, gasping for breath. The minutes passed until the snipers emerged, some of them just yards away from Roni. Somehow they never noticed him. </p> <p>He waited for nightfall, then ran towards the beach. With no clear plan, he plunged into the water and swam. And swam. And swam. An explosion struck nearby, rippling out across the water. But Roni kept swimming. Eventually, exhausted, he reached shore again. Who knew by then where he was? (In fact, despite swimming for six hours, he had covered only six kilometres.) He heard voices: they could have been Israelis, they could have been Lebanese. But the language was Hebrew. Incredibly, he had reached his very own regiment, finding them in the place to which they had retreated. He staggered on to the beach and was saved. </p> <p>When I speak to Roni Dayg, he concedes the strangeness of seeing the most traumatic moment of his life drawn and animated on a big screen. But he is relieved, too. For years, he explains, he had felt awkward with the loved ones of those soldiers killed beside the beach, as if they somehow resented Dayg for having survived, as if they believed he had saved himself at his comrades' expense. </p> <p>\"I couldn't look at their families,\" he says. \"I felt responsible. Now, with this film, it's all out. This shows what happened.\" He's had calls from old friends, people he hadn't seen for years. \"And that feels good.\"</p> <p>The relief is not confined to those featured in the movie. Waltz With Bashir seems to have released something long pent up among veterans of Israel's least celebrated war - described at the time as the country's first \"war of choice\". The film's makers say they are now constantly buttonholed by men in their 40s desperate to tell their stories of Lebanon. According to art director David Polonsky, \"You realise that they've been walking around for 25 years with this life-changing experience and they've never talked about it.\"</p> <p>This focus on the experiences of IDF veterans may bring grumbles from some of Israel's critics. Isn't Waltz With Bashir asking us, however artfully, to sympathise with the invaders of 1982, not the invaded - to somehow see the IDF, rather than the Lebanese and Palestinians of Beirut, as the victims of that war?</p> <p>It is not a new criticism. The spate of American antiwar movies about Vietnam were also faulted for casting young US draftees as the central casualties of the conflict, rather than the Vietnamese themselves. But there is a peculiarly Israeli dimension to the objection, too. In Hebrew they speak of \"shooting and crying\", shorthand for the tendency to depict the Israeli soldier as morally conflicted, the reluctant warrior whose heart is broken by having to kill his enemy. Such an archetype runs through Israeli folklore and can be seen as a mechanism that allows Israelis to emerge from even their darkest episodes with their moral self-image intact. </p> <p>Folman was fully alive to this risk, but is adamant that Waltz With Bashir does not succumb to it. \"When you watch this film, you have no doubt who the victims are.\" He says it's impossible to have sympathy for the IDF soldiers when you see the impact of their invasion - and this film certainly shows that impact, from the casual trashing of Beirut streets to the eventual carnage of the refugee camps. </p> <p>Indeed, the catastrophe at Sabra and Shatila is given a weight that sets it apart from the rest of the film. In the final minutes, animation gives way to real-life video footage of the slaughtered - including one unbearable image of a child. In this sense, the Palestinian dead are given a three-dimensional realness denied everyone else. </p> <p>Should Folman have gone further and told Palestinian stories with the same close humanity he gave to himself and his fellow Israelis? He considered it, wondered about making a \"Rashomon\" of 1982, showing the conflict from the differing viewpoints of all those involved. But it was not for him. \"Who am I to tell their stories?\" he says of the Palestinians. \"They have to tell their own stories.\" Not that Folman believes Waltz With Bashir conveys only a narrow Israeli experience. There is a universal lesson to be drawn from his film. It is that war is not Platoon or Steven Spielberg's Band Of Brothers: \"It has no glory, no glamour, no bravery, no brotherhood of men, nothing.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the most surprising frame of the entire movie is one of the very last: a fleeting acknowledgment of support from Israel's culture ministry and film board. Folman says that when Waltz With Bashir has played at festivals in cities around the world, local Israeli embassies have embraced it. </p> <p>It's an unexpected reaction, given the unflinching depiction of Israeli brutality, IDF soldiers shooting and shooting even when they have no idea who they are shooting at. And yet it's not so hard to understand. For one thing, the Israeli soldiers in the film have had their humanity restored to them: they are not faceless killing machines but terrified young boys. </p> <p>More importantly, perhaps, the film is at great pains to make crystal clear what has long been murky: exactly who did what at Sabra and Shatila. Again and again, Folman's script stresses that the massacre was committed by Christian Phalangists (who even slashed crosses into the chests of their victims). The publicity material quotes Folman thus: \"One thing for sure is that the Christian Phalangist militiamen were fully responsible for the massacre. The Israeli soldiers had nothing to do with it.\" That act of clarification is probably reason enough for Israeli officialdom to have welcomed the film. </p> <p>But there is much to give them discomfort. Sharon himself is shown tucking into a massive cooked breakfast - including five fried eggs - while the killing goes on all around. Later he is notified by phone that a massacre is rumoured to be underway: he thanks his informant and does nothing. That is one of the few flashes of political anger in the film. Elsewhere, there are no statements or polemics, even though its story was given new resonance as production got underway in the summer of 2006 - with the outbreak of the second Lebanon war. Polonksy, the art director, recalls that any illusion that he and his team of animators were working on a mere \"artwork\" was shattered. \"It was happening in real time again; the same stupidity all over again.\"</p> <p>Could Waltz With Bashir move Israeli hearts and minds so intensely that it prevents a future war? None involved thinks so. \"Cinema doesn't change the world,\" they say. But for those who where there, they have performed a service. \"None of us spoke about this war,\" says Folman. \"I've tried to open things up.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Waltz With Bashir is in cinemas from November 21.</p>",
  "<p>Thanks to the movie, people tend to assume that they know about John Updike's The Witches of Eastwick: it's the one where a hammy devil sexes up some frustrated divorcees. This isn't totally accurate. Set in the early 70s, the book is as much a satire on baby-boomer liberationism as an amused updating of witchcraft lore. </p> <p>Alexandra, Sukie and Jane, the witches, have supernatural powers deriving from their status as divorced women in their sexual prime. All three are involved with married men before Darryl Van Horne appears on the scene. Alexandra is a good deal less skinny than Cher, Jane is nastier than Susan Sarandon's character, and Van Horne is a shambling, bisexual impresario with a mask-like face and, we're told, ice-cold semen. When a younger rival marries him, the trio give her cancer. </p> <p>Witches was Updike's first sustained effort to put female characters centre-stage. While the writing, as always, is permanently cranked up to 11, the women are impressively realised figures. At the same time, there's a weird double-vision at work. The idea of sexuality as a kind of witchcraft is pitched as an ironic exaggeration of a small town's fear of liberated women. Yet the tongues wagging against the central characters emerge from a post-60s backdrop that's imagined in a distinctly small-town way. The witches' most bitter enemies are self-righteous liberals, and we hear a fair bit about drug-addled hippies, bomb-throwing war protesters and scary black people. Updike's attitude towards these culture-war cliches is mysterious; he doesn't always play them strictly for laughs. But perhaps, as Margaret Atwood wrote at the time, \"any attempt to analyse further would be like taking an elephant gun to a puff pastry: an Updike should not mean but be\".</p> <p>A similar proviso applies, in spades, to Updike's latest novel, which catches up with the three women as they get to grips with mortality. At the end of Witches, they remarried and went their separate ways. Alexandra has ended up in New Mexico with her laconic former art teacher; the others have stayed behind on the east coast - Jane as the wife of an effete Boston Brahmin, Sukie as a romantic novelist married to a loutish salesman. All three husbands die, of natural causes, and the ageing former witches get in touch with one another. Earth-motherish Alexandra is the main point-of-view character, as before. Jane, still cynical and malicious, though now addicted to puns, has become rich. Sukie, the sexy one, has lost half her lung function to emphysema but is otherwise herself. They cook up a plan: why not spend a summer in Eastwick? </p> <p>First, though, Updike spends 100 pages lavishing his descriptive resources on an account of their earlier adventures in package tourism. Alexandra responds to widowhood by taking a guided tour of the Canadian Rockies, where they use different money and a fellow tourist who resembles her dead husband disappoints her by referring to his late \"partner\" (\"This fag had been wasting her time\"). </p> <p>Next, she and Jane take a trip to Egypt, which turns out to contain pyramids, tombs and a museum, all of which are reviewed at length, plus potentially scary Muslims. Finally, all three women visit China, where food is eaten with chopsticks. (\"This was China, teeming under Heaven's mandate.\") The strange thing about this section, apart from its narrative pointlessness, is the self-consciousness with which Updike sets about transcribing stereotypes concerning foreign parts. One page-long sentence inscrutably catalogues American notions of China, from \"dragon ladies, rickshaws and comic-strip pirates\" to \"competitor for the dwindling global supply of oil\", via \"tender seedbed of budding free enterprise\". </p> <p>When the action shifts to Eastwick, a plot of sorts emerges. Chris, the younger brother of the girl they cursed, now \"an overweight poof\", plans to take magical vengeance. This plotline is resolved in an unexpected way (Sukie seduces him with the aid of a strap-on dildo), but not before the women have all got naked at a defensive witches' sabbath, leading to a description of \"once thick and springy curls turning gauzy and gray, pubic clocks ticking unseen, decade after decade, in their underpants\". As you'd expect, there are cranky discussions of mobile phones, facial piercings, and how \"all this hooking up the young people do\" is soulless and mechanical in comparison to their adulterous high jinks in the 70s. Cancelling out the earlier book's amoralism, Jane is dramatically punished for her sins. Meanwhile, Alexandra has an epiphany during a meal with her grandchildren: she will live on through her descendents, \"layers of inheritance and affinity invisibly ramifying\". </p> <p>Updike has had a long and distinguished career. In some quarters, the Rabbit books are said to put him in the company of Saul Bellow and Philip Roth. Like many of his minor works, The Widows of Eastwick lends more weight to the view of him as an almost spookily unreflective channeller and prettifier of baby-boom Americana, with a selectively blind eye to various uglinesses and a sideline in overwritten vagina-descriptions. All the same, whatever you make of his writing style, there's no denying that the facility with which he turns out those lovingly cadenced, alliterative sentences is an awe-inspiring spectacle. In spite of its absurdities, the new book keeps this up, every now and then throwing out a simile (an old churchgoer's corpse \"as brittle and dry as a flower pressed in a Bible\") that even his detractors would have to call pretty good.</p>",
  "<p>For years, Visa Electron has been the poor relation of the card family. Dubbed the card banks give to people on the breadline, teenagers and those who can't be trusted with credit, some shops and websites turn their noses up at it.</p> <p>All in all, it is not generally viewed as a must-have. But now there is a very good reason for having one - it allows you to side-step Ryanair's sky-high debit- and credit-card charges, which can dramatically push up the cost of those \"free\" flights.</p> <p>Travellers have been shocked to discover that the low-cost airline has more than tripled what it charges for regular debit-card payments from \u00a31.20 to \u00a34. That is \u00a34 per person, per one-way flight, so a family of four buying \"free\" return flights would fork out \u00a332 in card fees alone. </p> <p>Outraged Guardian Money readers say the card fees belie Ryanair's claim to offer \"100% free flights\". The Office of Fair Trading says the fees are at the discretion of the company concerned, but tells companies they cannot hide \"non-optional\" charges. Ryanair blames credit-card companies for the change - it says it was unhappy at the unfavourable discrepancy between debit- and credit-card charges.</p> <p>However, there is a way of avoiding the new charge, and that is to get yourself a Visa Electron, as these do not incur any fee at all. You don't have to be a teenager or on a low income to get your hands on one. If you and your family fly a couple of times a year, it may be worth getting one.</p> <p>Electron is an unusual type of debit card, as it offers a restricted level of flexibility. Essentially, you can only pay for goods if you have enough money in your account. Only a small handful of UK banks - Halifax, Bank of Scotland, the Co-operative Bank and Abbey - issue them, according to Visa. Alliance &amp; Leicester offered them until last year, a bank spokesman says, but dropped them as a result of customer complaints that the cards were not accepted in enough stores and outlets.</p> <p>The Easycash basic bank account offered by the Halifax and Bank of Scotland comes with a Visa Electron debit card. Anyone can apply for this account, though it does not offer interest, overdrafts or a chequebook. The Co-op Bank account offering a Visa Electron is called Cashminder, also a basic bank account with no overdraft. An Abbey spokeswoman says people can request an Electron card on almost every Abbey current account.</p> <p>Interest in the Electron is growing. Chatroom users of money websites including <a href=\"http://MoneySavingExpert.com\">MoneySavingExpert.com</a> report bank staff noticing a big increase in the number of requests for them.</p> <p>Karen Bryan, a frequent traveller who runs the Europe a la Carte (<a href=\"http://europealacarte.co.uk\">europealacarte.co.uk</a>) travel advice website for people on a modest budget, recently opened a Halifax Easycash account after spotting the debit-card fee hike. \"I just leave a couple of hundred pounds in mine in case I want to book a flight,\" she says. \"It's quite common for different fees to be applied between credit and debit card, as they are in other businesses. I just don't know how they get away with a \u00a34 fee per flight, not per transaction. I think people would prefer the airlines to be more upfront about the charges. After all, a \u00a310 flight all-in and advertised as such is still a great deal.\"</p> <p>Ryanair says its choice of Electron as the only fee-free card is down to a deal to boost the card's popularity. \"We're working with Visa to promote the Visa Electron card, and we do so by encouraging all passengers booking on Ryanair to use it, as this enables passengers to avoid any optional debit- or credit-card handling fees,\" a spokesman for the budget airline says.</p> <p>However, its website says that, as a special offer to Visa Electron card holders, no handling fee will be charged for \"a limited period only\". Flights bought fee-free with Visa Electron cards began in 2004. The Electron promotion also allows the airline to continue to advertise its flight deals at rock-bottom prices despite much higher final costs for most customers.</p> <p>Ryanair's new \u00a34 fee brings debit cards into line with credit card payments, and joins the growing list of Ryanair charges to watch out for, including checked baggage, airport check-in and excess baggage fees.</p> <p>Giles Howard, a 42-year-old businessman from St Albans, Herts, says he was let down by the debit-card charge that he says was not up-front or made clear until his flight confirmation.</p> <p>Enticed by an advert for a \u00a32 Ryanair flight sent to him in an email, and having booked plenty of budget seats before, he was savvy enough to know he would have to book carefully to avoid add-ons. He painstakingly picked four \u00a32 return flights to France last month.</p> <p>Delighted at his \u00a38 bargain holiday, he was then gobsmacked to receive a flight confirmation email telling him he owed \u00a340. \"I knew I was going to pay with a debit card - usually the cheapest way - and I did check the running total after each selection to make sure that the total was as advertised,\" he says. \"But you certainly do not expect your method of payment to make a five-fold increase to the price.\"</p> <p>Ryanair disputes this and says that the terms and conditions of handling fees are made very clear. Of course, Howard would not have had to fork out \u00a340 if he had paid with Visa Electron - a detail he says he discovered too late.</p> <p>\"Even though it was still a cheap deal, I feel the airline relies on not many people having Electron cards to be able to advertise those flights at \u00a32,\" Howard says.</p> <p>In response, the Ryanair spokesman says that \"almost 20% of our customers book with Visa Electron\", and stresses that Howard benefited from its lowest fares.</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading says it believes any decision over whether to charge for making payments by credit or debit card is one for the trading company. \"However, we are of the view that fixed non-optional charges should be included in all prices so that consumers are not misled,\" a spokesman says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://money@theguardian.com\">money@theguardian.com<br> </a></p>",

  "<p>In a bookshop on Charing Cross Road last week I bought Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles MacKay, first published in 1841. His remit is wide, covering everything from the Salem witch trials to the Tulipomania; his account of the craziness surrounding the South Sea Bubble reads like a current news item. </p> <p>In 1711 a company of merchants took on a large public debt, and in return were granted a monopoly of trade to the South Seas. The gold and silver mines of Peru and Mexico were legendary and, MacKay notes, \"everyone believed them to be inexhaustible\". The South Sea Company recapitalised and, though its trade produced no revenues to speak of, flourished. Its directors \"imagined they could ... carry on their schemes for ever, and stretch the cord of credit to its extremest tension, without causing it to snap asunder\". The company proposed to parliament that it take upon itself the entire national debt of \u00a330,981,712, and in February 1720, when the company's plans were accepted, its stock began to rise dramatically on Exchange Alley. Millions of share issues in the company followed, and innumerable other joint stock companies sprang up on a daily basis, solely for the purpose of raising shares in the market.</p> <p>On July 12 1720, the government banned 86 of these companies, which needed little more to set up than a statement of purpose - \"For the importation of Flanders lace\", \"For trading in hair\", \"For buying and selling lands and lending money at interest\", \"For insuring of horses\", \"For improving the art of making soap\", even \"For a wheel of perpetual motion\". The most fantastically absurd had the stated aim of being \"A company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\". When the man behind that stroke of genius opened his office in Cornhill, he was mobbed by subscribers, and by three o'clock, had sold all his shares and was \u00a32,000 richer. He was, MacKay notes, \"philosopher enough to be contented with his venture, and set off the same evening for the Continent. He was never heard of again.\" </p> <p>A card-maker published a pack of South-Sea playing cards, each card containing a caricature of a bubble company with a fitting inscription. \"Puckle's Machine Company\" was \"for discharging round and square cannonballs and bullets\" and \"making a total revolution in the art of war\". It was lampooned on the eight of spades, and its verse read: </p> <p>A rare invention to destroy the crowd <br>Of fools at home, instead of fools abroad. <br>Fear not, my friends, this terrible machine, <br>They're only wounded who have shares therein. </p> <p>By August 1720, the South Sea stock had been artificially inflated to over 1,000%, and the fall began. Nothing could be done to stop it. The Bank of England opened a subscription book but the stock still fell. MacKay is fairly harsh: \"Nobody seemed to imagine that the nation itself was as culpable as the South Sea Company. Nobody blamed the credulity and avarice of the people - the degrading lust of gain, which had swallowed up every nobler quality in the national character, or the infatuation which had made the multitude run their heads with such frantic eagerness into the net held out for them by scheming projectors. These things were never mentioned. The people were a simple, honest, hard-working people, ruined by a gang of robbers.\" In the House of Lords, Lord Molesworth suggested that the directors be sewn \"in sacks, and thrown into the Thames\". A bill was passed that restrained all those involved in the company from travelling, and to ascertain their estates and effects, although the treasurer escaped to France.</p> <p>Pope, in his Epistle to Allen, Lord Bathurst, describes the time: </p> <p>At length corruption, like a general flood,<br>So long by watchful ministers withstood, <br>Shall deluge all; and avarice, creeping on,<br>Spread like a low-born mist, and blot the sun; <br>Statesman and patriot ply alike the stocks, <br>Peeress and butler share alike the box,<br>And judges job, and bishops bite the Town, <br>And mighty dukes pack cards for half-a-crown: <br>See Britain sunk in Lucre's sordid charms ...</p> <p>I have no shares, but still spent most of the last week, while half-heartedly trying to copy-edit my novel, watching the bubble of high finance burst live on TV. I worked in the City of London for years and could never understand the focus on endless growth. The silver mines of Peru are not, in fact, inexhaustible. I listened to Gordon Brown give his rescue speech last week and even then, in response to a question, he mentioned the G-word. As I clicked on the Guardian website, to watch Brown's new announcement about the buying up of bank stock, an advert came on stating that the Post Office is helping thousands of businesses to grow. George Bush announced that US banks would be part-nationalised so they can support \"economic growth\". But \"growth\" makes me think now of the medical meaning - of a tumour needing to be removed, biopsied. Growth can only work where everything is infinite, and the world is not. The key word should be something else - improvement, say, or change.</p> <p>The market needs some of Walpole's regulation: \"for the excessive complication of derivatives and credit default swaps and associated paraphernalia\", \"for short selling\", \"for repackaging sub-prime mortgages in different forms and contracting bodies to buy them at the present time and also three years ahead without any knowledge of the quality of the product\". Our banks are the equivalent of the company designed to \"carry on an undertaking of a great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\". Who knew or understood the entire business and exposure of Lehman, or RBS or HBOS? Not, clearly, the FSA, and not the banking bosses, although they, no doubt, are philosophers enough to be contented with their venture.</p>",
  "<p>All in the Mind, Alastair Campbell's first novel, is about a psychiatrist, \"one of the country's top shrinks\", on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Professor Sturrock is \"stressed\", feels \"a rising sense of panic\", and wonders whether he is \"facing a weekend of angst and insomnia\". It is not an impressive vocabulary for a man who \"liked to think he was a skilful and profound observer of human nature\"; but like a lot of people, he is not eloquent under pressure. And Campbell is very interested, in this book, in how people like to think of themselves. </p> <p>Sturrock's first question to himself is about his own panic, which, as a man of science, he tries to \"quantify\": \"Was it manageable or did it herald a plunge?\" Managing seems to be Professor Sturrock's job - managing himself, which seems to mean keeping going as a competent and important professional without anyone noticing the cracks; and managing his patients' symptoms, which seems to mean persuading them to stop feeling as ghastly as they do, being cheerful, friendly and wise, ie very coercive. One of Sturrock's most promising symptoms is that he is beginning to notice that professional upbeatness doesn't seem to be doing the trick any more.</p> <p>Sturrock had told one of his patients, a rape victim, that \"his task was to help her accept what had happened, to help her to believe that her life could be good again, persuade her that, with time, the memory and the pain could fade\". But Sturrock is a man at the end of his tether; or, rather, a man at the end of his ideology. His rhetoric isn't working, which means, more or less, that his patients are not doing as they are told. Sturrock prefers to inform his patients than listen to them. \"No matter how many times he told her that there was no shame attached to what had happened, she felt it.\" Sturrock is beginning to realise that people are what they can't be talked out of. All in the Mind is the story of a man who has just noticed what he has been trying to do with words, and that all the things he can't do with words may be the things that matter most. It is, in other words, a book with a great deal of fear in it.</p> <p>Shrinks, as characters in novels, are a useful fictional device. Indeed, in many ways, shrinks are made for novels, partly because they are always, in a sense, fictional, invented by their patients and the people who have never met them; and partly because, like readers of novels, they are people who want to be told stories. Like readers of novels, they are supposed to be curious about other people's lives; they have a direct route to some of the culture's best-kept secrets and, it is assumed, they have a good reason to pry. They are only trying to help. </p> <p>So it's not surprising that once psychoanalysis and psychiatry (and anti-psychiatry) took off in the 1960s, shrinks regularly became characters in fiction. As objects of satire in Philip Roth, for example, or treated with a certain amount of sceptical awe in the novels of Iris Murdoch and Doris Lessing, shrinks were the uneasy alter egos or counterparts of novelists, people whose currency was other people's stories. Shrinks and novelists seemed to be involved in some kind of shared project: the so-called patients paid to tell their stories, the novelists were paid to tell them; the novelist was like an indiscreet shrink, the shrink was like an inhibited (or failed) novelist. The shrink was supposed to help people with words; the novelist was supposed to be doing something of value, though it was never quite clear what that was (novelists didn't tend to describe themselves as members of the helping professions). </p> <p>Given this difficult complicity, novelists either hated shrinks as rivals and quacks - as Nabokov did - or used them to voice things that couldn't otherwise be said, as Nabokov also did. And at a time when shrinks were serious and important (and self-important) - roughly the second half of the last century - they could be outed in fiction; they could be made to speak, which they were notoriously unwilling to do very much in real life, and they could be seen having lives outside their consulting rooms. Novels have always been great experiments in what happens when the private is made public; once all the psychotherapies began to make private life more and more private, the novel with the shrink in it could open things up again. New professional intimacies, new languages were being created by the therapy culture that the novel could, in the best sense, expose.</p> <p>In the world that is All in the Mind, there is nothing left to expose. The private life of the shrink at work - the dialogue with his patients and the shrink's private musings - seems barely worth repeating (\"There is a lot you can do,\" Sturrock says to a patient, \"just try to think a little bit positively\"). Sturrock's contemporary psychiatry is lucid psychobabble. \"Sturrock knew from bitter experience with other alcoholics that, until someone was prepared to face their problem openly, it was unlikely to go away.\" Both Sturrock and the narrator are starting to realise that there isn't enough news, that these thoughts, if that's what they are, are going nowhere. </p> <p>In the first half of the book, it is not entirely clear whether Sturrock's banality is a symptom of his breakdown, or of the novel's vagueness about what might really be going on. Campbell is shrewd enough to know, though, that Sturrock's language is a sign of the times. Sturrock's language is the book's anti-hero. Campbell's novel, whatever else it is, is a slightly cunning expos\u00e9 of the world of managed care, of empty helpful words.</p> <p>So All in the Mind is a sign of the times in what it has to say about shrinks and, by implication, about other professions in which people's authenticity is at stake. Shrinks, as everyone knows, are assumed to be mad - why else would they do what they do? - and required to be sane. Despite all the folksy talk of wounded healers, people by and large want their shrinks in one piece. A story about a shrink having a breakdown is going to be a story about someone crossing over, someone becoming the thing they fear, someone becoming the thing they should not be. If nothing else, it has gothic potential. And Campbell conveys the eerie inevitability of this happening to Sturrock in the early part of the novel with some success. The most affecting parts of the book are Sturrock's recollections of his childhood with a distant and uncomprehending father, and a family ethos in which intimate and unsettling things were smoothed over. Sturrock's father \"had been dead five years, but most days Sturrock would see him, somewhere\". The fraught casualness of \"somewhere\" works, and Campbell is often at his best with the odd straightforward word.</p> <p>But Sturrock is also at a loss because of what has happened to his profession. Sturrock seems to have been suffering from an optimism illness, from the kind of pathological enthusiasm and false belief in their own competence that people are now encouraged to have in the so-called mental health professions. And this has made him, perhaps unsurprisingly, rather maudlin; looking out of his office window, he \"wondered how many of the people he could see were less happy than he was\". He is \"widely viewed as one of the best psychiatrists in the business\", but the business seems to be about people making progress, and about making people happy (\"three patients in one morning, and none left any happier\"). As shrinks become more and more like personal trainers - helping people to get the best out of themselves - they become less and less like novelists and more and more like ideologues addicted to their own propaganda; people who want to hear about success rather than about failure, people who only have time for the formulatable and the achievable, rather than for the open-ended subtlety and complexity of people's lives. Sturrock is a man who has oversimplified himself. And what Campbell has done in this strange and unnerving book is write a story about failure - the failings and failure of an important, self-important shrink - from the point of view of a man who no longer has any idea what success could be.</p> <p>Sturrock knows something is wrong with him, but increasingly he has no picture of what it would be for things to be right. So the most convincing things in this uneven book are the dismay and the confusion - the wild bewilderment - that Sturrock blunders through with a mixture of faux-wisdom and faltering self-assertion. He has become a man, in Graham Greene's great description in Brighton Rock, \"worn with the awful labour of the trivial act\". He finds what he has to say to his family and to his patients trivial, unconvincing, utterly unengaging and unengaged. Sturrock's insulated isolation is chilling when it isn't reduced to bathos by Campbell's insistence.</p> <p>Campbell interweaves the story of Sturrock's unravelling over a long weekend with the stories of six of his patients: an eastern European immigrant who has been raped; a barrister who is a sex addict; a young woman badly burnt in a fire; an alcoholic politician caught in a sex scandal; an African woman involved in the sex trade; and a depressed and potentially suicidal young man. These are, as it were, topical cases, intended to show the range of Sturrock's clientele, but Campbell is deft in his characterisations, and each of these people comes to life with remarkable speed. We are told that Sturrock is an eminent psychiatrist - he has done \"research\", written books and commented thoughtfully about the pressures on his profession - but he comes across more as a sympathetic do-gooder, too well-intentioned to be inspired. He sets his patients \"homework\", gets them to write \"dream registers\" and lists of the positives and negatives in their lives, and so on. He believes, or did believe until recently, in a mix of therapeutic techniques and watered-down Christianity - \"the key to your humanity is your humility\", he tells one of his patients, in a moment of apparent illumination - but over this fateful weekend he realises that he can't practise what he preaches. His wife and children feel unloved and unknown by him, and he feels adrift in the midst of his patients' ongoing crises.</p> <p>Sturrock has obviously believed in the past that life is not an ongoing emergency, that people can be happy if they can find the reason why they are not, and that psychiatry can really help people rather than fob them off with science and sensibleness. And as he loses confidence in his \"empty, platitudinous, over-optimistic answers\", he notices some other telltale signs: he begins to over-identify with, and mildly envy, his depressed patient David, who he now believes is the only person who can understand him; he begins to desire his patient who had been a prostitute, and he starts visiting prostitutes himself. </p> <p>Campbell is very good at describing what it is like to flounder around for satisfaction with no sense whatever of what it is one needs. A lot happens in the chaotic and eventful weekend of the novel: Sturrock's aunt dies; his wife leaves him; and he turns to his patients for relief. It is, even from Sturrock's point of view, horrifying and rather farcical. The whirligig life of people running on empty is really Campbell's theme, but it is not Sturrock's. Indeed, it is intimated several times that when people begin to bore themselves, there is really something wrong with them. Sturrock is a bore, bored with himself; a man with favourite themes and nothing else. \"Humility. It was one of Professor Sturrock's favourite themes. He believed that humility was the key to self-respect and mutual respect.\" Campbell's hero is a man suffocated by his own liberal platitudes. </p> <p>All in the Mind begins slowly, as it should, because it is a novel about something dawning on somebody; and it is a novel that ends too sentimentally. It is worth reading for the account of Sturrock's mind haemorrhaging with terror, and of all the impulsive and compulsive acts that are his attempted self-cures. It is a frightening account of a mind giving way, of the sheer helplessness of a managed life breaking down. Unable to \"stand the noise and dirt and the mess of people swirling around him . . . he felt talked out\". He has talked himself out of his own life. </p> <p>For contemporary novelists, the psychoanalyst - the person with the couch and the talking cure, the person interested in whether people can choose their words - is taken for granted as a potentially engaging character. The spate of recent novels about analysts - Something to Tell You by Hanif Kureishi, Where Three Roads Meet by Salley Vickers, Asylum by Patrick McGrath - is proof, if proof were needed, that analysts are a significant voice in the culture, whatever one thinks of them. But by making a thoroughly modern shrink his hero - a man who talks but says very little, all of it backed up by research - Campbell seems to want to show us that the enthusiastically helpful and the scientifically competent, at least in the mental health professions, are a danger to themselves and other people. The \"gnawing emptiness\" that Sturrock's depressed patient experiences as \"expanding beyond his own body space\" is a feeling that may not be unfamiliar to many people in his field now. All in the Mind is warning us that the solutions of those who want to improve our lives can be a big problem; and perhaps that we need to know more than we do about the private lives of our helpers. The writing in this novel comes to life when Sturrock plummets; that is, when he stops trying to be helpful and Campbell tells us what is going on.</p>",
  "<p>At a time when a crisis is unfolding that will deflate American power irreversibly, the next US administration could be elected on the back of voters for whom denying women abortion choice and promoting creationism in schools are more important than the state of the world at large. To be sure, the financial crisis may allow American voters to overcome the drag of racism and elect Obama, despite his obvious intellectual superiority. But whatever the outcome, the leadership of the world's largest liberal democracy is not going to be decided by anything like rational argument, or by concern for problems that lie beyond America's shores.</p> <p>The upcoming American election kept coming to mind as I read Chris Patten's What Next?. In many ways this is an extremely impressive book. It is a very long time since a leading British politician produced anything so ambitious, or as well written. The subject is nothing less than the global condition at the start of this century. Nuclear proliferation, global warming, oil production and the energy crisis, world poverty and the \"bottom billion\", the illegal drugs trade, immigration and human trafficking and the spread of epidemic diseases are all examined, with asides on Russia, China and practically every important development in world history since the Renaissance. </p> <p>Patten is rightly scornful of some aspects of current political discourse: \"You do not need to be a grammarian,\" he writes, \"to know that you do not fight wars against common nouns but against personal ones. You fight a war against this or that country or enemy. Wars on drugs, wars on poverty, wars on waste - all these things are idle if grandiose ways of describing doomed political ventures.\" It is a crucial point, elegantly stated. But whoever wins the presidential election, the next administration is sure to want to ramp up America's bungling \"war on terror\", most likely by taking the failed Afghan campaign into Pakistan. Maybe the war on terror will simply implode, along with the American financial system. Certainly, the vast levels of military </p> <p>expenditure of the past 20 years cannot be sustained. But it is hard to see the US, which alone among the countries engaged in Afghanistan still believes the war can be won, quietly departing the scene. A political solution is nowhere on the agenda. Even Obama has urged that US forces hunt down the Taliban by following them into Pakistan. If this happens America will have mired itself and the world in another intractable conflict, this time in an increasingly unstable state that is also nuclear.</p> <p>Throughout his conspectus of global issues Patten is supremely confident that he knows what needs to be done. Despite occasional swipes at recent policies, What Next? is conventional wisdom of the most elevated kind and, like all versions of the genre, it avoids unmentionable realities. For example, while he discusses population growth in passing on several occasions - mostly in conjunction with a dismissive reference to Thomas Malthus - Patten at no point confronts the vast problems posed by the fact that human numbers will rise by around another 50% over the next half-century. Informing the reader that in the second millennium \"the world's population increased 22-fold, while global domestic product went up 13 times as fast,\" he shows no hint of doubt that, as long as globalisation continues, this trend will also continue. </p> <p>In failing to consider the possibility that there may be a human population problem Patten has plenty of company. He is at one with Marx, Hayek, Mao, the Pope, the Bush administration and many development economists. But is this near-universal denial of natural limits on human expansion well-founded? Or is it no more than a silly orthodoxy, like the faith of an earlier generation of bien pensants that central planning would create an economy of abundance?</p> <p>An integral part of conventional wisdom is the conviction that all reasonable people subscribe to it, and this faith lies at the heart of Patten's view of the world. Stung by a rightwing commentator who, in response to his rather modest criticisms of the Iraq war, described him as a \"liberal internationalist\", Patten writes: \"To my mind there is nothing else for a sensible person to be\". Evidently, Patten thinks the same is true of most of the opinions aired in the book. At times - in his analysis of the Iraq war, for example - he is plainly right. What is questionable is his assumption that the thinking that led to the Iraq war will prove to be an aberration.</p> <p>Patten begins What Next? by citing approvingly Margaret Thatcher's remark at her last cabinet meeting, \"It's a funny old world.\" By the end of the book, however, it is clear that he sees the past eight years as a blip on the screen of history. Along with liberals across the world, he is confident that, with a new incumbent in the White House, what could be considered normal service will be resumed. \"To live in a better world,\" he writes, \"requires a more democratic citizenry, a sentiment inherent in Senator Obama's presidential campaign oratory.\" But what if the debacle on Wall Street leaves America fear-ridden, resentful and more stridently fundamentalist - whoever becomes president? It looks as if the future of the world is going to be funnier than Patten imagines. </p> <p>\u2022 John Gray's Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia is published by Penguin.</p>",
  "<p>We sat in the <strong>Wind Dog Cafe</strong> (01957 744321, <a href=\"http://www.winddogcafe.co.uk\">winddogcafe.co.uk</a>) at Gutcher on the island of Yell, waiting for the ferry to take us to Unst. Outside, the channel between the islands was grey, choppy and beaten by rain. Inside the Wind Dog Cafe it was bright and warm. The cafe might not subscribe to the niceties of modern metropolitan design chic. It is too practical for that. But then, most modern metropolitan cafes don't double as library, arts and community centre, and internet hub as well. Oh, and it's a great place from which to spot otters. The soups are rollicking, warming, homemade concoctions. There's a crofter's lunch of ham, cheese, oatcakes and pickle; bannocks are filled with cold Shetland lamb; the baked potatoes are island grown; and cakes, biscuits and pies are baked on the premises. Just the kind of food needed to keep the weather at bay.</p> <p>\"We have a phrase in Shetland. We say we're atween weathers,\" said Alastair Hamilton, my guide, mentor and passionate advocate of Shetland's foods, as we peered out the windows. It had snowed two days earlier, rarer than you might think in Shetland. The day before had been bright and sunny. Now rain was flying in on the wind.</p> <p>Any visitor to Shetland - Shetland, mind, never the Shetlands; Shetlanders will purse their lips together in mild remonstrance should you say \"the Shetlands\" - had better go prepared for rapid changes in meteorological conditions. There are 100 or so islands that make up the archipelago. They lie, green and low, hummocks in the turbulent sea 130 miles to the north of Scotland. Like pieces of a jigsaw slightly strewn out on the sea, they look as if, with a little ingenuity, they could all be fitted back together. In a sense, they do all fit together. There is a strong sense of community and interrelation between the 15 that are regularly inhabited. </p> <p>Not only is Scotland quite a long way away, geographically speaking, it's almost treated as a foreign country by Shetlanders themselves. You don't often see the Saltire on display. Tartans are nowhere to be seen. Indeed, it only became part of Scotland in 1469.</p> <p>Alastair and I were on our way to the <strong>Skibhoul Stores &amp; Bakery </strong>(01957 711304) on Unst, overlooking Baltasound, where Penny Thompson sells just about everything you might need by way of food supplies, but also makes Oceanic Oatcakes, so called because she has replaced the salt with seawater. In every other sense, they are classic oatcakes: mild, wholesome and addictive. I bought several packets to keep me company.</p> <p>Inevitably, the sea dominates Shetland's history. During the late-19th and early-20th centuries, crafts, ships and fortunes were built on cod, ling and, above all, herring, caught on longlines from sixareens - six-oared fishing boats. You can see two splendid sixareens in the <strong>Shetland Museum</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.shetland-museum.org.uk\">shetland-museum.org.uk</a>) in Lerwick. Conveniently, the museum has a stylish canteen, where you can order traditional dishes such as a homely sassermaet (sausagemeat) burger, based on a 19th-century recipe, local salt beef, Shetland lamb bannocks and potted rabbit, as well as more modern combinations.</p> <p>There's still a healthy fishing industry around Shetland, landing cod, herring, skate, saithe and halibut, but the innumerable inlets, crystalline waters and ferocious tidal races have made it a key centre in the mussel and salmon farming industries. It's impossible to miss the strings of large black buoys, like humps of the Loch Ness monster's back, neatly lined up in blocks, or the circular salmon pens.</p> <p>Mussels and salmon cropped up on a good many menus. I had memorable mussels in a white wine and cream sauce at <strong>Monty's Bistro</strong> (01595 696555), a bright, lively upstairs restaurant in Lerwick (with a notably easily priced wine list, incidentally). The flesh of the crustacea was plump, sweet and quivery against the gently rich sauce. Thick slices of delicate, firm, close-textured smoked salmon contributed to a fine seafood platter at the<strong> Olive Tree </strong>(01595 697222), an immensely cheery deli-cum cafe in Lerwick, run by the redoubtable Bo Simmons. And just around the corner from the Olive Tree is the <strong>Hand-Made Fish Company</strong> (01950 422214, <a href=\"http://www.handmadefish.com\">handmadefish.com</a>) where Dave Parham, a refugee from Devon, produces superb smoked haddock and, to my mind, even better smoked organic salmon, experimenting with the effects of various woods, including larch (interesting and rather good) and juniper (too fugitive for my crude taste buds), while relying on old oak whisky barrels (smoky, sweet and brilliant) for his general stock. </p> <p>Dave's smoked haddock surfaced on the breakfast menu at the comfortable and cosy <strong>Busta Hotel </strong>(01806 522506, <a href=\"http://www.bustahouse.com\">bustahouse.com</a>, doubles from \u00a3105 B&amp;B), a 16th-century laird's house overlooking Brae Voe, where I stayed. Aside from big-hearted breakfasts, the kitchen makes full use of local lamb, free-range pork from Unst, Muckle Roe mussels, halibut from Bressay, and Yell Sound scallops. Even the milk, cream and butter are produced locally.</p> <p>Indeed, generally, the raw materials in Shetland are as good as anywhere in the UK, which means they are very good indeed. I couldn't say that public cooking yet is in quite the same class. However, the Shetland Islands Council is beginning to address the need, and this month saw the first Shetland Food Festival, opened by Jean-Christophe Novelli, who immediately sent the local rumour-mill into overdrive by declaring that he wanted to open a cookery school on one of the islands.</p> <p>There is a good deal to be said for meandering up through the islands, as I did. For the outdoor enthusiast there are great walks, such as along the black basalt cliffs at Eshaness. There's fishing to be had in the sea and lochs. There's a good deal for the keen birder. And there's plenty of evidence of Shetland's vigorous past going back 3,000 years, particularly the monumental brochs, giant stone towers like hives. </p> <p>As my flight lifted into the air from Sumburgh airport, I looked out of the window. The land and sea below me were bathed in warm sunshine. Was that just a lull atween storms? Or had the new weather arrived?</p> <p>\u2022 NorthLink Ferries (0845 600 0449, <a href=\"http://www.northlinkferries.co.uk\">northlinkferries.co.uk</a>) sails Aberdeen-Lerwick, from \u00a321.40pp each way.

  "<p>\"Ali Smith is one side of a triangle of British writers with slyly overlapping names: Monica Ali and Zadie Smith are the other two,\" said <strong>Sophie Gee</strong> in the Financial Times, reviewing The First Person and Other Stories. \"They all started out as smart, semi-experimental, exuberantly comedic female voices writing from the margins - and they now define the post-Drabble literary establishment. Their writing fuses modernism and post-modernism: cosy streams of consciousness in the manner of Woolf and Forster mixed with chatty, quirky passages reminiscent of Rushdie and Kureishi . . . The First Person has many hallmarks of comic, experimental British female fiction: working-class voices, regional characters, lesbian sex acts and quotidian details tumble cheerfully together. But, as a result, the collection feels too much like 'literary fiction' is supposed to feel - the devices are no longer jolts from the margins; they are comfy and relaxed, too much at home.\" \"Smith's characters lack names, jobs or even personalities,\" wrote <strong>Fatema Ahmed</strong> in the Observer, \"but they do have time for repetitive stretches of dialogue about making tea. After a while they - and their relationships - blur into one another. Most frustratingly, though, they are constantly remarking on their keenness for narrative while failing to provide enough of it.\"</p> <p>\"This is far from being a museum catalogue or dusty work of criticism,\" said <strong>Robert Douglas-Fairhurst </strong>in the Telegraph, reviewing Paintings in Proust: a Visual Companion to 'In Search of Lost Time'. \"Like most studies of Proust, it offers only a thin slice through \u00c0 la recherche; the key difference is that it also gets to the novel's troubled heart. Proust's use of painting is rich and strange. At times, the references to Vermeer or Poussin show the narrator looking at life through another pair of eyes, learning that there are many private worlds within this shared world of ours . . . Good writers may provide an escape from the world, but as Eric Karpeles's magnificent study reveals, it takes a great writer to show us how to engage with it again.\" \"Compact and a pleasure to handle,\" noted <strong>Paul Taylor</strong> in the New Statesman, \"this volume is both the dernier cri of the highbrow coffee-table book and a deep, often humorous encouragement of more sensitive thought about Proust and his masterpiece.\" </p> <p>\"Duncan Wu's biography is, like its subject, passionately partisan,\" wrote <strong>John Carey</strong> in the Sunday Times, reviewing William Hazlitt: The First Modern Man. \"At times he verges on fiction by inventing conversations that he feels must have taken place, but which do not occur in the historical record. This may attract scholarly frowns, but it undoubtedly livens up his writing. For all that, the claims he makes are wildly extravagant. The reader blinks to learn that Hazlitt possessed 'laser-like intelligence' and 'an almost godlike perspective'. Such estimates cut no ice unless backed by the kind of analysis that Tom Paulin attempted in The Day-Star of Liberty, and Wu never gets near that critical terrain.\" \"Whatever one thinks of Hazlitt's obsession with Sarah Walker (his landlady's daughter), unflinchingly detailed in his Liber Amoris, Wu rightly derides a coterie of American academics' arguments for his exclusion from the syllabus on the grounds of guilt of sexual harassment,\" said <strong>Sarah Burton</strong> in the Independent. \"Ironically, such impulses to censor bring to mind the repressive libel laws an insecure government imposed on Hazlitt and his contemporaries.\"</p>",
  "<p>The full scale of the persecution of Christians in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul became apparent last night when the UN's refugee agency said about 13,000 had been hounded from their homes this month - more than half of the city's Christian community.</p> <p>The UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) said it was sending aid to thousands of Christian refugees fleeing Mosul after a three-week campaign of killing and intimidation. About a dozen Christians have reportedly been killed in the recent violence, prompting many members of the community to seek sanctuary in churches and homes in outlying villages, or in Syria. \"Many left with little money and need help,\" said Ron Redmond, UNHCR spokesman, in a briefing from Geneva. Christian neighbourhoods had been bombarded with threatening phone calls, letters and messages pinned to doors for months, but the killing began a few weeks ago, he said. </p> <p>Recounting the story of a woman named Mariam, Redmond said she left her home when she heard of a Christian who was murdered.</p> <p>\"We were the hard core that never wanted to leave Iraq, even with the tense environment,\" the woman, who fled to Syria, was quoted by UNHCR as saying.</p> <p>No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, but suspicion has fallen on Sunni extremists intent on turning the historic city into a stronghold.</p> <p>Local Sunni officials deny the allegation, pointing the finger at Kurdish militias who, it is said, want to empty the city of Christians before upcoming local elections. The Kurdish regional government also denies the claims.</p> <p>Mosul, Iraq's third biggest city after Baghdad and Basra, has remained mired in violence despite the US military surge. Al-Qaida insurgents regrouped in the city after being flushed out of neighbouring Anbar province, taking advantage of its proximity to Syria. </p> <p>After a period of relative calm roadside bombs and assassinations gradually returned to Mosul, giving it the reputation as the Iraq's most dangerous city.</p> <p>The province of Nineveh, which has Mosul at its heart, has been home to Assyrian and Chaldean Catholics for 2,000 years. Before the fall of Saddam Hussein Iraq's Christian population numbered about 1.2 million.</p> <p>But the upsurge of violence has prompted a mass exodus, with 20% of the 1.5 million Iraqi refugees in Syria thought to be Christians.</p> <p>The return of sustained religious violence will also raise fears over Iraq's fragile security and lend weight to calls for the Iraqi government to give US troops a legal mandate to maintain security for a further three years.</p> <p>Meanwhile a Shia cleric, Jalaluddin al-Saghir, yesterday endorsed a draft US-Iraqi security pact. \"The country is passing through a most critical stage,\" Saghir said. \"The politicians should think about Iraq's interests. They should not seek to break the unity of Iraqi society. This is not a game.\" The proposed agreement has been opposed by a number of critics, including the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who say it infringes Iraq's sovereignty.</p>",

  "<p>As recession bites hard, a more despondent, down-at heel group of people than the debtors at the bankruptcy courts in the Strand would be hard to find. Waiting for their papers were mothers with fractious children, weary old men, an Italian singer, a lorry driver, a decorator, a former City trader, and scores more, all with their stories to tell. </p> <p>Then astonishingly there was Micky waving at me, still with the studs in his nose and eyebrows, an unexpected old friend. He was in the next-door flat when I lived briefly on the Clapham Park Estate, a man I wrote about in my book Hard Work. Once he was a social worker, but when I met him he'd been out of work for six years following a nervous breakdown. So what brought him here today? He smiled, and shrugged. The same as just about everyone else in that waiting room - credit card debts. </p> <p>He owed \u00a320,000. How on earth did that happen? There was an overdraft and then some cards, until a company offered to sweep all his debts into one - at an even worse interest rate. The most he'd earned was \u00a312,000 a year, and that was a while back, but he was offered all these cards. Recently he called Provident, the lender of absolutely last resort, looking for a loan just to hold off the threatening letters. Yes indeed, they said - but at 184% APR. That's when he finally gave in and went for bankruptcy. \"I got another card through my door this very morning saying I'd been 'pre-selected as suitable for a loan' from yet another company. I couldn't believe it. They're still at it. Nothing's changed.\" </p> <p>Others round the room joined in, exchanging stories of the same debt collecting companies. \"I haven't opened my front door in months,\" said the Italian singer who owed \u00a346,000, juggled between five credit cards. The lorry driver had shuttled debts between cards for eight years, full of shame, until rolled-over interest swelled to \u00a365,000; he was paying off \u00a31,500 a month, more than the \u00a3300 a week he earned. A care-worn mother with a toddler and a baby was too depressed to speak; her brother said she'd been going through a bad time when she accumulated the \u00a310,000 debt, and it just grew. \"God knows how they let her borrow all this!\"</p> <p>Few waiting for bankruptcy papers that day had any assets, property, cars; some had lost their jobs. In most cases there was nothing to repossess, though one woman sectioned under the Mental Health Act risked losing her home in Bow, but the registrar delayed it. If ever there was sub-prime debt, here it was. They might have been devil-may-care good-time spenders, but most had struggled frantically to keep up payments, until debt advisers told them to file for bankruptcy. </p> <p>Registrars and officers in bankruptcy courts express despairing astonishment at how debt was allowed to bubble out of control in recent years and \"on-the-never-never\" entered the nation's bloodstream. The Enterprise Act that came into force in 2004 toughened anti-cartel legislation, but also sought to \"modernise insolvency law\" - a symptom of how Labour fell under the spell of City magicians who said deregulation would let the boom rip. Debt and bankruptcy must not hurt risk-taking, they said. Start-ups must be allowed to fail painlessly, so entrepreneurs can pick themselves up and try again. The act discharged bankrupts after a year instead of three. Debts soared, bankruptcies more than doubled and kept rising. </p> <p>British law is now so lax there is even bankruptcy tourism, especially from prudent Germany where it takes six years to be discharged. A German car dealer with large debts back home was waiting in court that day: he only had to establish a token business here and British law would wipe out his German debts in a year's time. </p> <p>One wise judge said there was now no reason why the penniless with nothing to lose shouldn't seize every opportunity the credit industry offered to borrow until they bust - then do it all over again. The banks spread the cost invisibly among the rest of their customers in a secret redistribution. It had suited everyone, fuelling high street spending. Luckily for reckless capitalism, the poor are willing to work hard in essential jobs that don't pay a living wage, so they need to borrow: they are mostly honest and easily shamed by debt collectors. That's why banks go on lending to them, as most move heaven and earth to repay. </p> <p>But while some drown in credit, a credit drought is killing off others. As the real economy shrinks for the first time in 16 years and shares again plunge alarmingly, ministers promise small businesses protection from going bust due to banks refusing loans. Will it happen? The British Bankers' Association retorted this week that the onus is not on banks to keep businesses afloat. \"It seems inevitable some businesses will not survive,\" it said. Already some 280 small businesses are folding every week. Yesterday I was contacted by Powertech, a thriving solar boiler company that has just landed a string of orders worth \u00a33m, including a contract with Aga/Rayburn to fit all new ranges - the fruition of 10 years of development. With new orders from Canada and the US, it needs to hire staff and pay for containers from China. Yet its bankers of many years are refusing more than a \u00a320,000 overdraft. Without credit they can't fulfil orders, and would be bought out. </p> <p>We the people own so much of the banking system yet still allow banks to use state funds to fatten up their capital assets, instead of giving good credit where it's desperately needed. How is it that bad credit at toxic rates still isn't firmly controlled? A government that this week had nothing to say about Lloyds TSB paying out bonuses from taxpayers' money seems equally incapable of asserting its authority to make banks lend. After being rescued from certain catastrophe, bankers are as full of hubris as ever; and the government is as eager as ever not to interfere, but to sell off its holdings as fast as it can. </p> <p>Spam in my inbox yesterday from Churchwood Finance offered: \"Refused a loan? Judgements, defaults and blacklisted? No problem! Loans from \u00a3500 to \u00a3250,000.\" Meanwhile, here's a small test of Labour's willingness to use its new bank ownership well: will the government see that one of the people's banks lends money to Powertech, part of the green future?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html\">latest polls</a> show that the race for the White House, entering its final two weeks, may be <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/06/opinion/polls/main4504633.shtml\">tightening up</a>, with John McCain shaving down Barack Obama's lead to six points among likely voters. But at least among one particular set of voters - Latinos, who could make up as much as 11% of the electorate on November 4 - Obama <a href=\"http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1599\">still enjoys</a> <a href=\"http://www.americasvoiceonline.org/2008/pages/conventional_wisdom_is_wrong_again\">60% support</a>.</p> <p>This is utterly remarkable, considering that just four years ago, George Bush won an unprecedented 40% of the Latino vote, a huge help in winning a second term in office. By comparison, McCain's piece of the Latino pie has <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/6051023.html\">hovered at about 26%</a> for months. His recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/19/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">Spanish-language ads</a> attacking Obama's lack of support for a McCain-sponsored immigration reform bill have done little if anything to help his cause in battleground states with large Latino populations: Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada.</p> <p>So just how did the Republican party's recent gains among Latinos all but disappear during McCain's campaign? Well, he certainly had plenty of help from Bush himself and the party. After all, it was Republican members of Congress who sponsored a 2006 bill to classify undocumented immigrants and those who aid them as felons. That sparked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/28/usa.danglaister\">nationwide grassroots protests</a>, each attended by thousands of Latinos, and led to bitterness toward the party within the community. Add to that the fact that McCain has <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M34KKaczvKg\">disowned his own immigration-reform bill</a> during the campaign, saying that he wouldn't vote for it now, and you've got a community who feels betrayed by the right.</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that McCain has spent little time <a href=\"http://washingtonindependent.com/7855/mccain-courts-latino-vote\">campaigning in the Latino community</a> until his campaign took a nose dive recently, while Obama began TV and radio ads in Spanish-language media since early 2008 and met with major Latino labour leaders to garner their support.</p> <p>While Bush's historic support from Latinos can be attributed at least in part to his growing up in the heavily-Latino Texas and counting Latinos among his advisers, McCain seems to have made no significant ties to the Hispanic community in his 26-year congressional career.</p> <p>The result? McCain has been endorsed by one Spanish-language newspaper - the decidedly lightweight and uninfluential El Diario de las Americas, whose endorsement editorial seemed to have been copied and pasted from McCain's website. McCain also boasts backing from reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee, C-list Mexican actor Eduardo Verastegui, and 50 Hispanic business executives - not one of them well-known - whose names the McCain press office recently released.</p> <p>Some analysts have said that a reason for McCain's Latino woes is that his story and record have not gotten out to the Latino voters. Not likely, as McCain has run for president twice now, speaking about his harrowing experience as a Vietnam war POW each time. It's more likely that Latinos, who historically tend to vote Democratic, like Obama's strong backing of unions (Obama's campaign slogan, \"Yes We Can\", is an English-language translation of revered Mexican-American civil rights leader Cesar Chavez's <a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/01/obamas_si_se_puede.html\">\"Si Se Puede\"</a>), his past support of <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/02/obama-defends-d.html\">driving licenses for undocumented immigrants </a>and his history of community organising in Chicago. </p> <p>But don't underestimate the power of Obama's personal story - the son of an immigrant, who faced down racism, worked hard to get an education and returned to his adopted hometown to help his community. That bio mirrors many Latinos' own backgrounds and aspirations, and the ability to vote for someone whose experience and values parallel your own may be the biggest motivator of all.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Being Juan Malkovich</strong></p> <p>There are multiple John Malkovichs in the multiplex this autumn: he plays an ousted CIA man in Burn After Reading, appears in Clint Eastwood's Changeling and has a cameo in The Mutant Chronicles. This week, it was announced that the busy actor is also returning to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre\">theatre</a>, and will direct a play in Mexico City. The Good Canary, which opens next month, follows an author whose career is derailed as his wife succumbs to drug addiction. The play, written by the American Zach Helm, will be performed in Spanish. Diego Luna will play the lead role at the Insurgentes theatre. Last year, Malkovich directed a French-language production of Helm's play in Paris, and won the best director gong at the Moli\u00e8re awards. </p> <p><strong>Corr blimey!</strong></p> <p>Singer Andrea Corr, who shot to fame with her siblings in the Corrs, will make her West End stage debut next year. She will star alongside Niamh Cusack and Susan Lynch in a revival of Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa at the Old Vic. The play, which follows five sisters in rural Ireland, will be directed by Anna Mackmin. The Old Vic's 2009 lineup also finds Kevin Spacey directing an in-the-round production of Complicit, a political drama by Joe Sutton, which will receive its world premiere at the theatre. </p> <p><strong>BAM Mendes</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, Sam Mendes will direct Old Vic revivals of two classic plays as part of the Bridge Project, a collaboration with Neal Street Productions and the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), designed - in Mendes's words - to \"bring classics to a new audience\". The Cherry Orchard (newly translated by Tom Stoppard) and The Winter's Tale will be performed in rep with a cast including Ethan Hawke and Simon Russell Beale.</p> <p><strong>McAvoy's Apollo mission</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338972923\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/24/mcavoy.jpg\" alt=\"James McAvoy\" width=\"140\" height=\"193\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James McAvoy. Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Apollo and the Duke of York's have also announced star draws to help them kick-start 2009. James McAvoy takes time out from his blossoming Hollywood career to star in Richard Greenberg's Three Days of Rain, which opens for previews at the Apollo from January 30 2009. He is joined by EastEnders' Nigel Harman in the story of childhood friends unlocking family secrets from the past. The Duke of York's is reviving Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge with Ken Stott and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Stott, who became the face of Ian Rankin's Rebus on TV, recently starred in Yasmina Reza's God of Carnage. Mastrantonio is best known for playing Maid Marian in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and earned a Tony nomination on Broadway for Man of La Mancha.</p> <p><strong>Not many happy returns</strong></p> <p>There was a bittersweet celebration for Avenue Q at the Noel Coward theatre last night. The feelgood musical, which follows the ups and downs of foul-mouthed puppets on a shabby New York street, celebrated its 1000th performance at the theatre. And as the cast joked after the final curtain, here's to the next 150! The gala show came days after the announcement that the musical will close on March 28 2009. It will be replaced by a West End transfer of Calendar Girls, penned by the film's original screenwriter Tim Firth. Calendar Girls enjoyed a sold-out run at the Chichester Festival theatre last month and stars Patricia Hodge and Gaynor Faye as Yorkshire villagers who strip off to raise money for charity. </p> <p><strong>Come to the cabaret</strong></p> <p>Liza Minnelli will take up a two-week residency at the Palace on Broadway in December, marking her first performances on the Great White Way in almost a decade. The show, Liza's at the Palace, will find Minnelli backed by a 12-piece orchestra and belting out several Kander and Ebb songs, such as New York, New York. Minnelli will be joined by a quartet of dancers for a high-kicking tribute to her godmother Kay Thompson. The routine will resurrect Thompson's celebrated cabaret act of the 1940s. Minnelli's mother, Judy Garland, appeared at the Palace herself in the 50s; Liza last appeared there in 1999, when she performed songs from Garland's films. </p> <p><strong>Fasten your seatbelts</strong></p> <p>The big Broadway opening of the week was the Barrymore theatre's Speed-the-Plow, which has enjoyed rave reviews to rival the Old Vic's recent production with Kevin Spacey and Jeff Goldblum. Neil Pepe directs this revival of David Mamet's scathing play about Hollywood, starring Entourage's Jeremy Piven in his Broadway debut. For Variety's David Rooney, Piven's \"tightly wound physicality and easy command of rapid-fire, hectoring dialogue make him a natural fit for Mamet\". New York Times critic Ben Brantley says the Barrymore theatre \"should provide seat belts\" as the play \"pursues its corkscrew course at such velocity that your instinct is to check yourself for whiplash \u2026 Is cynicism supposed to be this energizing?\"</p>",
  "<p>In the world today there are between 17 and 20 million slaves.

I was pretty hopeless at it. The Chinese, on the other hand, were fantastic: very clean and hard working. I was exhausted. We were getting up at 5.30am, at work by 7am. There were probably six or seven hundred of us picking away, with two toilets and no drinking water. You'd finish about 7pm. And then most people would go and work in a book factory, eventually getting some rest \u2013 if they could, in such overcrowded accommodation \u2013 at about 4am. </p> <p>But modern slavery isn't just bad for those who are being exploited. It's bad for the people doing the exploiting. And the people who are blindly part of the system. I think on the whole British people are a very fair and kind, but there's a lack of understanding about how widespread this problem is. I thought the reports were all exaggerated. I thought it was left-wing extremists stirring up trouble. It isn't. </p> <p>And that's dangerous. When people don't feel a part of another culture, aren't educated into our way of thinking and have no investment in the country, it's very easy for them to be antagonistic towards it. Ghettoising people is never a good idea. And these people feel a huge resentment against the west, against the greed that it represents. The kinder we are, the less likely we are to have aggressive behaviour coming back in our direction; terrorism, even. The more humane we are to people the nicer they are back to us. This is a problem that will come to haunt us unless we do something about it soon.</p> <p>Maybe the changes we're experiencing at the moment will help this. Perhaps the new economic regulation will translate into labour regulation. If we pride ourselves on living in a civilised country we need a realistic minimum wage, maximum working hours and proper healthy and safety regulations, and these must apply to migrant labour. There needs to be an understanding that our economy would collapse overnight if we didn't have these people doing the shit jobs that no one else does. There needs to be recognition of mutual dependency. Legislation needs to reflect that. Most importantly, our attitudes need to change. And fast.</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://www.unchosen.org.uk/\">Unchosen film festival </a>runs for a week from tonight in Bristol.</p>",
  "<h2>England told classes for migrants need to improve</h2> <p>The standard of English language classes for adult migrants and refugees in England is improving, but more needs to be done to raise class quality from \"satisfactory\" levels to good or outstanding, according to the latest report from the UK's education watchdog Ofsted.</p> <p>The report also warns that not enough businesses are providing English classes for migrants in the workplace.</p> <p>Ofsted inspected English for speakers of other languages (Esol) courses at over 20 state-funded further and adult education colleges in England. Its report, published this month, provides the first indications of how the Esol sector has been affected by the withdrawal of government subsidies for all students, which took effect in August of last year. </p> <p>Inspectors say that data available suggest Esol enrolments nationally dropped by 14% in autumn 2007 compared to the same period in 2006, and asks the government to monitor the impact of fee policy changes closely.</p> <p>The government's efforts to standardise qualifications for Esol students appear to have been successful, with most providers now offering courses leading to recognised Esol Skills for Life qualifications, which were introduced in 2004. But students' success rates remain low with only 64% achieving satisfactory results.</p> <p>In the report, Ofsted says more needs be done to persuade employers of the value of offering Esol learning to employees. Students should be given more opportunities to gain work experience.</p> <h2>South Korea signs up to student swap with US</h2> <p>The US government has demonstrated its commitment to supporting South Korea's campaign to boost English language skills, with an offer to host up to 5,000 Korean students a year on study and work placements in the US. </p> <p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and South Korea's foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan approved the Work, English Study, Travel (West) programme in New York last month.</p> <p>University graduates will be able to apply for West programme visas, which will allow them to enrol on self-funded five-month English language training courses, then find internships with US companies for up to 12 months. They will be allowed to travel in the US for a further month.</p> <p>South Korea will offer US citizens an 18-month working holiday programme visa.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the government has unveiled plans to offer Koreans an alternative to travelling abroad to learn English, by creating a city dedicated to English language learning on the island of Jeju. </p> <p>Ministry officials announced last month that the city, which is due to open in 2011, would cost $1.17bn and eventually accommodate 12 English-medium schools.</p> <h2>Call to tax Britain for language advantage </h2> <p>Last month's European Day of Languages, the Council of Europe's celebration of linguistic diversity and language learning, has prompted a controversial proposal to compensate EU countries for the cost of having to learn English by taxing Britain and Ireland.</p> <p>Michele Gazzola, a researcher at the economics languages and training observatory at the University of Geneva, said that English speaking countries gain huge financial advantages from not having to master Europe's main language of communication. They should help to fund their neighbours' efforts to learn English.</p> <p>Gazzola quotes a 2005 study that estimates the UK's savings on language education, and profits from the sale of English language teaching materials to the rest of Europe, at between $14bn and $23bn. </p> <p>His solution is simple: end the controversial $7bn annual rebate that the UK receives from the EU budget and spend the money on expanding the EU's interpreting and translation services or supporting linguistically burdened researchers.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"mailto:max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com\"> max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Late at night on a busy road in Melbourne, a young policeman is trying to be patient with a migrant taxi driver whose English is virtually nonexistent. \"Sir, did you realise your driver-side headlight is out?\" he says. The driver shrugs as politely as he can.</p> <p>\"It's broken,\" the policeman tries again. \"You'll have to get it fixed.\" <br>Again, the response is just bemused shrugs. After five or six different formulations, the officer rolls his eyes and waves the taxi on to make way for the growing queue of cars being stopped for random breath testing. At least the driver hadn't been drinking.</p> <p>This kind of communication breakdown is not rare in Australia, where the demand for labour, particularly in lower-skilled occupations, attracts a diverse mix of non-English-speaking migrants.</p> <p>In previous generations, such migrants waited for the required period and then applied for citizenship, regardless of language acquisition.</p> <p>Last year, the government, then led by Liberal prime minister John Howard, sought to address these communication problems by introducing a assessment for would-be citizens that required them to pass a test of \"basic English\" and demonstrate knowledge of Australian history and culture. Those changes were opposed by the Labor party, which is now in power. </p> <p>One question in the test, which asked applicants to identify Australia's famous 20th century cricket hero Don Bradman, was held up by Labor and immigrant support groups as evidence that the test was out of touch with the realities of contemporary life.</p> <p>However, a 66% fall in applications in the three months after the test was introduced in October 2007, compared to the previous three months, prompted the new administration to take action. In January it launched a review to reassess what level of knowledge about Australia new citizens should need and to better define how much English language they would need to function. </p> <p>The review was chaired by Richard Woolcott, a former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs. He describes the report he submitted earlier this summer as \"fairly meaty\", having considered 172 submissions. </p> <p>The report is now with immigration minister Chris Evans. Woolcott said it would be some weeks before the government gave its response.</p> <p>Woolcott said the committee had drawn a \"clear distinction between the kind of knowledge you require to be a citizen and the kind of knowledge that might be needed to integrate into Australian society\".</p> <p>He said that one of the problems with the existing citizenship test was that the notion of \"basic English\" was not adequately defined.</p> <p>\"There are things you'll want to know that might come up at a barbecue. And then there are things you need to know to become a citizen \u2014 and that certainly doesn't include a knowledge of who Don Bradman was,\" Woolcott said.</p> <p>But for all the controversy over requiring migrants to learn English, some argue that the test is too easy. </p> <p>Jaspreet Singh, a tertiary-educated taxi driver who came to Melbourne from India 10 years ago, said: \"If you intend to live in a country long term, you should learn the language. </p> <p>\"I recently asked another driver to help me jack up a car that had been in an accident. He had no idea what I was talking about.\"</p> <p>Shadow minister for immigration Sharman Stone warned against dividing language needs into \"English for citizenship\" and \"English to integrate\".</p> <p>\"That's an artificial distinction. If you have enough English to understand the roles and obligations and values described in our citizenship documents, then the same English is required for day-to-day life. It's not about knowing who Don Bradman is \u2014 that's a very 1950s way of thinking.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not many British kids dream of being professional American footballers. True enough, last year's Super Bowl-winning New York Giants team featured two players born in Britain \u2013 defensive end Osi Umenyiora and kicker Lawrence Tynes \u2013 but both had moved to America when they were still young, discovering American football in high school and going on to play it in college before going pro. To date, the only British players to play a regular season NFL game without first playing in college have been kickers and punters \u2013 players who could directly transfer skills developed playing rugby or 'soccer'.</p> <p>Neither of Jason Brisbane or Lorn Mayers grew up wanting to play in the NFL. Before being dragged by friends down to training sessions with the London Blitz \u2013 an amateur British team - at the ages of 17 and 18 respectively, neither really knew an awful lot about it. It is a fact that makes their stories all the more remarkable. And in Mayers' case, tragic.</p> <h2>Lorn Mayers</h2> <p>British American football had never seen a prospect quite like Lorn Mayers. Standing 6ft 3ins tall and almost the same again wide, you couldn't fail to pick him out on the field. Explosive and agile enough to dunk a basketball despite weighing 25 stone, you couldn't take your eyes off him once you had.</p> <p>After a single game for the Blitz youth, in which he played on both sides of the line and even at full-back, Lorn was called up to England's under-18 team. By midseason in his first year, he had moved up to the Blitz's senior team, where he became a full-time defensive tackle. By the end of the season he was playing for Great Britain. </p> <p>Even then, Mayers had no idea how far his talent was about to take him. \"I was still learning, I didn't know nothing about football,\" recalls Mayers when I catch up with him this week. \"I remember loads of people talking to me, telling me 'you can do this, you can be special' and whatever. I'm just taking it as it is, putting my hand in the dirt and playing ball.\"</p> <p>Still only 19, Mayers was spotted by NFL Europa scouts at a Great Britain practice early in 2005. \"One of the coaches approached me because of the way I ran down a hill,\" chuckles Mayers, who was asked to attend a testing day similar to the NFL's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine\">scouting combine</a>, in which his speed, strength and mobility were measured through a series of drills. Shortly afterwards, he was invited to spend four days at a league training camp in Tampa, Florida. </p> <p>\"They told me it was just going to be for four days,\" says Mayers, who had to request the time off from his day job as a deliveryman for Argos. Instead, on the last day, coaches called him into the office to say they wanted him to stay and join the Berlin Thunder for pre-season training. \"I'm like: 'that's nice, but I've got to go back to work \u2013 you told me four days!'\"</p> <p>Mayers returned home to his job and thought no more of it. Until, about a week later, he took a phone call from Jeff Reinebold (NFL Europe's Senior Manager of International Player Development at the time). Despite having seen him for just four days, the Thunder wanted to sign him in time for the 2005 season. </p> <p>By his own admission, Mayers still only had a basic grasp of defensive line play, but the Thunder's coaches knew what he was capable of. By the time he had served notice at Argos and moved to Berlin the season was already upon them, but the team assigned coaches to stay with Mayers constantly and help him learn the playbook. Although he didn't start a game, he played in several as the Thunder went to NFL Europa's championship game \u2013 the World Bowl. </p> <p>\"A couple of NFL scouts came down for World Bowl practice,\" remembers Mayers. \"I just remember we were practicing field goals, but they threw in a pass play from the field goal formation. I went to rush the field goal and the holder threw it, so I intercepted and ran it back. Next thing I know this guy's asking me to come to training camp with the Oakland Raiders.\"</p> <p>And so, with little more than a year's experience of the game under his belt, Mayers became the youngest player ever signed to an NFL roster. \"It was different,\" says Mayers of training and playing alongside then Raiders Warren Sapp and Ted Washington, defensive tackles with 11 Pro Bowl appearances and two Super Bowl rings between them. \"But I held my own. The odd bit I could have done better, but that just made me work harder in the gym.\"</p> <p>Mayers played in three pre-season games, and had \"strong, strong feelings\" that he would have made the Raiders' final 53-man roster, were it not for visa complications. Having only moved out to America at the last minute, he had never had time to sort out a working visa and by the end of camp he had used all three months of his eligibility to stay in America under the waiver scheme. He returned home with assurances from the Raiders' coaching staff that they would come calling again. </p> <p>The next NFL Europa season was a frustrating one. Although Mayers was now starting for the Thunder, he picked up an injury to his shoulder, then another to his knee and was ruled out of trying out again for the Raiders. </p> <p>Nevertheless he went away confident that his career was moving in the right direction. \"A couple of people from the Raiders still contacted me,\" he notes. \"I knew if I went away and put the work in, they were still keeping an eye on me.\"</p> <p>But that was before he was shot repeatedly in the early hours of New Year's Day 2007. Mayers had been celebrating with friends at the Elbow Room in Islington, when a gunman opened fire inside the club. Although three others suffered less serious injuries, Mayers' condition was termed \"critical\" when he arrived at the Royal London Hospital. \"It was just a case of wrong place, wrong time,\" he sighs when I ask what he recalls of the incident. \"All I remember is being there that night, chilling, having fun.\"</p> <p>Mayers shrugs and says he doesn't even know how many times he was hit, but shows me the scars left by bullets taken to his chest, stomach, pelvis, arms and legs. He remained in hospital for four months and found when he initially came to that had no movement in his right leg and was unable to grip with his left hand.</p> <p>It is tempting to consider his survival something of a miracle. \"I believe the Lord did bring me through this,\" notes Mayers, who considers himself a Christian but admits to not being a regular attendee at church. Sitting before him, I am more tempted to credit the sheer toughness \u2013 physical and mental \u2013 of a man who already in life had overcome the death of both parents, giving up his own education to help raise his younger sister Leanna, who is now studying at the University of Hertfordshire to become an interior designer. </p> <p>Leanna, then 17, took her turn to look after her brother as he returned home after four months in hospital. Mayers remained bed-bound for much of the rest of the year and from there he was into a wheelchair, but when I see him he is walking with a single crutch, as well as a protective boot on his right foot. For close to a year now life has consisted of getting up at 5.30am and walking down to his local leisure centre to begin the first of two epic physio sessions. It has been monotonous, but the progress is evident. Lorn has recovered much of the movement in his right leg, and the grip in his left hand \u2013 with the help of regular Guitar Hero sessions - has returned to the point that he is able to conduct a full upper-body work-out. </p> <p>\"It's too easy to be easy on yourself,\" says Mayers. \"I know I've made good progress, but I'm not happy with the progress that I've made. I can't really just get to a certain level and be like 'I'm cool'.\" </p> <p>I ask Mayers what his ultimate goal is, whether he hopes to eventually play sport again. \"I'd love to,\" he grins, before catching himself. \"I mean, the doctors have told me that's maybe unlikely, but they haven't told me for definite.\" For now that's not the priority. Like a coach insisting his players are focussed only on the next game, Mayers says he is just thinking about what his next step his \u2013 when and where he can return to work, or whether he might return to college. </p> <p>\"I still need to work out who I am,\" says Mayers. The word \"survivor\" springs to mind. </p> <h2>Jason Brisbane</h2> <p>Unlike Mayers, Jason Brisbane wasn't instantly marked out by his physical attributes. At 6ft 2ins and just 13 1/2 stone, he was an undersized linebacker even for the top division of British American football, let alone the NFL. </p> <p>In Britain he was able to make up for that lack of size with speed, aggression and what coaches like to refer to as 'a nose for the ball'. He quickly played his way into the Great Britain teams at youth and then senior level and in 2004 he set a team record for the Blitz by recording 22 tackles in a game. He was named the British American Football League's Most Valuable Player in the same year. </p> <p>Gradually, Brisbane began to believe he could pursue the sport further. \"I'm balling with the senior team and suddenly I'm thinking 'Yeah, I'm pretty good at this. If I can get myself up to a decent weight, I can really contend.'\"</p> <p>But playmaking ability alone was not enough to impress NFL Europa's scouts. Despite attending several training camps in Tampa, Brisbane never made a team. When NFL Europa folded last year, the international player development scheme \u2013 through which 16 foreign players who have not had the opportunity to play college football in the US are signed to NFL teams' practice squads \u2013 became his best remaining shot at making it as a pro. </p> <p>Knowing his time was running out, Brisbane committed to a rigorous weight-lifting programme. \"I'm 25 now, and that is really the cut-off point, you can't really be trying to get into the NFL any older than that,\" he says, though some other players on the scheme this year are as old as 29. He showed up at trials weighing 16 1/2 stone and was duly picked up by the San Diego Chargers. </p> <p>\"I'm still a skinny guy now,\" insists Brisbane when I remind him of his former stature. \"Trying out, I put on a bit of weight and to be honest I overdid it and wound up getting fat and slow. So I've trimmed down a little bit again, tried to put on good weight.\"</p> <p>The rules of the development scheme prevent the Chargers from promoting him to their active roster, but they also mean he can't be cut. That, for Brisbane, was a major blessing. </p> <p>\"It was a huge step up,\" he acknowledges, before quickly adding that he found the mental challenges of mastering the playbook trickier than the physical aspect. \"Even now I feel like I'm definitely a little bit behind, but I'm improving with each week going by. When you come into camp, everyone's already had four or five months with the playbook in OTAs (Organised Team Activities), so the first few weeks of camp are very tough.\"</p> <p>The rules also meant that Brisbane was always guaranteed a quick return to London for this weekend's game against the New Orleans Saints, who themselves have another British player \u2013 wide receiver Marvin Allen \u2013 on their practice squad. He has enjoyed playing the tour guide for a week, if less so the constant mockery of his accent \u2026 and requests from team-mates that he organise a meeting with the Queen. </p> <p>But for Brisbane the jibes are worth it for the experience he has gained this year. He was able to play a few snaps in a pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers, and despite a couple of embarrassing moments in practice \u2013 he admits having been burned by tight end Antonio Gates and \"shaken out of my shoes\" by running back Ladanian Tomlinson on occasion \u2013 he has grown massively in confidence throughout his stay. </p> <p>\"In the next year or so I want to make a team's active roster,\" says Brisbane \u2013 who indicated he may opt to stay in California after the season ends to work out with one of the training centres that help college athletes prepare for the scouting combine. </p> <p>On the face of it the odds don't look great. The development scheme began in 2004, and so far only one player \u2013 Mexican guard Rolando Cantu - out of 38 who have taken part has gone on to play in the league. Having completed a degree in business management last year, Brisbane has a solid fall-back position, but right now he's not dwelling on it. </p> <p>\"Football is never guaranteed to happen. So I have my plan B, but right now plan A is working out pretty good.\" As a good friend of Mayers, Brisbane may be more aware than most of how quickly life can take opportunities away from you. But also that you should never let that stop you from trying.</p> <p><em>Lorn Mayers and Jason Brisbane began their American football careers with the London Blitz, who compete in the Premier Division of the British American Football League.

  "<p>Just as well football is not always so predictable. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic\">Celtic</a>'s humbling at the hands of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchesterunited\">Manchester United</a> was not only widely anticipated by bookmakers, even fans of the Scottish champions didn't travel to Old Trafford with much expectation.</p> <p>Fair play to Gordon Strachan. Rather than whine about the controversial nature of Dimitar Berbatov's two goals, Celtic's manager conceded: \"I know when I have been well beaten.\" Wayne Rooney had a legitimate strike ruled out on Tuesday night after all; onlookers could hardly waver from the thought that United could and should have inflicted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/22/championsleague-manchesterunited\">more significant damage than a 3-0 defeat on their Scottish visitors</a>.</p> <p>Strachan's other pertinent point in the aftermath of the Old Trafford rout has become a recurring one. He has bemoaned his players' inability to pass with a high level of accuracy, even over five yards. That such a problem is pertinent owes as much to errors from the past as it does the shortcomings of 2008.</p> <p>Celtic's annual general backslap \u2014 sorry, meeting \u2014 took place last Friday. The year's revenue was in excess of \u00a370m once again; those with violins who cite the financial limitations of Scottish football as the main reason no club from north of the border will ever come close to winning the Champions League should have a glance at the accounts of apparently better-renowned clubs.</p> <p>The issue at hand is more basic. Celtic \u2014 and Rangers, for that matter \u2014 have been cash cows for years. Generating income way beyond any of the teams they play against on the domestic front has not been a problem for more than two decades. Basic attendance figures, let alone international marketing, tell you that. </p> <p>Sporadically, and it has happened again in the last few days, Old Firm fans have cited a lack of competition or the poor standards of the Scottish game as the reason behind their favourites' inability to match those who now dominate Europe.</p> <p>Yet in the not-so-distant past, with money seemingly no object, Celtic <br>saw fit to bestow \u00a35m on Gremio for the services of Rafael, \u00a36m on John Hartson and the same amount on Chris Sutton. Those who, partly legitimately, argue the latter two players at least represented value for money as Celtic flourished under Martin O'Neill should consider why at that point, or even before, such money was not invested elsewhere. Put simply, it was because supporters and those within the club would not substitute instant success for long-term thinking. </p> <p>If Scottish football has a genuine fault, it is that the leading two clubs have been more obsessed with beating each other to the championship every season than displaying foresight. It is a ridiculous notion, given just how much Rangers and Celtic's income outstrips their domestic rivals. </p> <p>It took Celtic until 2007, for example, to open a training facility worthy of their supposed status. Those five-yard passes and any production line of young talent are intrinsically linked to such matters. You would have thought the club may have wanted to lead the country, if not possibly Europe, in terms of youth development and conditions for young players to hone their talents long before then. And the impact on Strachan is plain; those coming through his own ranks lack that basic five-yard passing talent despite a decent record in winning youth trophies in the last decade. </p> <p>Too many players, after all, have filtered through the Celtic system without making an impact at first-team level at Parkhead, or anywhere else either; selling Alan Hutton was hard for Rangers fans to stomach, but at least the \u00a39m fee justified the existence of their youth development schemes. </p> <p>Only two players in Celtic's starting XI on Tuesday, Stephen McManus and Aiden McGeady, came through the equivalent ranks in the east end; a shocking return for a club the size of Celtic and a damning indictment on their outlook long before Strachan took office. Middlesbrough, for example, despite having a much smaller pool of talent from which to choose, put the Scottish champions to shame both in terms of scouting and facilities. </p> <p>We may yet see a French-style system in Scotland, where young players spend virtually their entire lives at the clubs that nurture them, but it seems a long way off. Notwithstanding the fact immigration rules prevent South American or African youngsters from coming north of the border to hone their talent, it is high time the outlook of the major clubs changed. </p> <p>Celtic have the financial clout to be at the forefront of such improvements; Strachan, sadly, will be long gone before we learn whether or not they have the desire.</p>",

I'm getting bored.\" </p> <p>With the markets constantly spooked by the prospect of a deep and prolonged global recession, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/23/marketturmoil-globalrecession?commentid=4e71859d-dd41-4085-894f-077c977b4422\">GolemXIV</a> provided an insightful analogy: \"Imagine a group of men walking across an ice sheet. They are roped together for safety. Or as the financial world characterises it - to spread the risk. Great in theory. But each man is carrying an anvil of debt. One man, lets call him Lehman, falls through. The ropes tighten, everybody stops still. No one can move. Lending stops. </p> <p>\"What they should do is collectively put down their anvils and let them slip down the hole Lehman made. Huge losses but the ice is safe, the hole doesn't widen. But none of them will do this. Each is convinced that one day their anvil of debt will turn to gold and they'll be rich once more. So they stand there, slowly dragging each other towards the hole. As they get pulled closer together, their combined weight threatens to crash the entire ice sheet. The bad news is WE are all living on that sheet.\" </p> <p>Indeed, news early in the week that public finances were deteriorating rapidly, driven by a weakening economy and overspending by the government, was shrugged off by many such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/20/governmentborrowing-economics?commentid=866fafce-e5da-46bc-951d-798bc7bce0dd\">awless</a> as only the start of the problem: \"The downswing has only just begun. The PSBR figure doesn't include all the money pumped into banks etc nor do they include all the Enron-style off-sheet liabilities like PFI etc. It's far, far worse than the headline figures suggest.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/20/governmentborrowing-economics?commentid=64b87e55-006f-4bf5-a840-9ad1f0aec85a\">teganjovanka</a> added for good measure: \"Face facts, the UK is a debt junkie and one day very soon it'll have to finally pay its bills. God help us.\" </p> <p>The warning of \"unprecedented\" turmoil in banking by Mervyn King, which sent sterling down to a five-year low against the dollar, caused many to turn their wrath on the governor of the Bank of England himself. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/22/pound-recession-interest-rates?commentid=9eee0cc7-0d00-4ce3-87c4-4a6627d8c9af\">961a</a> wrote: \"There goes Mervyn again, putting his great foot in it. \"This whole mess started when he set out to make an example of Northern Rock rather than trying to quietly sort things out.

  "<p>The sky is falling. Capitalism is collapsing. Free enterprise has crapped the bed and rolled in it. Marxists are looking smug. Conservatives are thinking up imaginative new ways to blame everything on poor black people. Liberals are telling us that if we keep our chins up and hold hands everything will soon be right as rain again.</p> <p>And sports fans? I was on a train from Boston to Philly last week and the lass in the seat in front of me was nearly hyperventilating with glee as she recounted every pitch, swing and byzantinely sophisticated tactical decision in last night's humdinger of a preamble to the World Series in which the Boston Red Sox came back from 7-0 to win 8-7 in the 8th inning. </p> <p>I watched part of the game in a bar of a boutique hotel in the company of business folk who, as the game progressed, stopped whining like whipped dogs about how letting spivs run around making insane bets with gazillions of dollars of made-up fairy money had turned out not to be a very good idea after all (who knew?). Then their mood slowly swung from glum to dumbstruck to hugging-and-kissing-total-strangers delirious. </p> <p>Which is all by way of saying that I think sport will survive the ongoing economic apocalypse. It provides escapism. It produces storylines where David sometimes humbles Goliath. And, perhaps most importantly, it provides an arena where working- and middle-class people can gather to shout the vilest abuse imaginable at the totally out of touch millionaire scum who own, manage and play for the teams we subsidise. </p> <p>Like Gordon Brown \u2013 and, I'm guessing, like you \u2013 I am rather keen to see the rich suffer as a result of this crisis. And I'd also like to see the same rollback of privatisation and deregulation that we've seen in banking take place in football. I don't know if George W Bush's socialistic bailing out of Manchester United shirt sponsor AIG now means that some small portion of the club now resides in the hands of the US government. But that would be a start.</p> <p>And I also hope the current economic crisis leads to the collapse of the Premier League and the reinstitution of a four-division league run for and by the sport as a whole rather some faceless, soul-sucking spivocracy. </p> <p>In my wilder moments I see the government stepping in to nationalise the big four and the Old Firm \u2013 on the basis that these clubs are vital to the spiritual and cultural wellbeing of the British people and are thus far too valuable to be left in the hands of folk so demented they invented a financial system based on moonbeams. </p> <p>And I'd like to see the executive boxes turned into allotments. Just for starters. </p> <p>If this recession does deepen into the biggest depression since 1929, it's likely that suburban America will rediscover soccer as the simple and inexpensive game it is in most of the rest of the world. We might also see the withering of elite travel leagues that charge huge pay-to-play fees and thus all but ensure the non-participation of working-class families. Whether this will force suburban soccer to start looking towards the inner cities for players and opponents remains to be seen. But it could be the first step towards proletarianisation that the game in the States desperately needs. </p> <p>Ice hockey and American football will likely survive in the US \u2013 despite the huge cost of the equipment needed to play them. Gridiron in particular has vast phalanxes of partisans busy making sure the game keeps sucking cash out of the educational system at both school and college level. But it's also a safe bet that if hard times do roll around, grassroots gridiron will continue to lose ground to leaner, cheaper and (not an unimportant consideration in a country without free universal health care) way-less-likely-to-put-your-kid-in-hospital soccer and basketball.</p> <p>A big loser will likely be the so-called X-Sports \u2013 those equipment-based pseudo-sports some sociologists see as an unconsciously racist attempt by white suburbanites to find prole-free games where they won't get their asses handed to them on a regular basis by black kids. </p> <p>Will any specifically depression-era sports make a come back? Marathon dancing - as seen in the film They Shoot Horses Don't They? - would probably find it difficult to re-establish roots in a culture that has spent the last three decades eschewing proper dancing in favour of just letting it all hang out and jiggling about like a jellyfish with the collywobbles, man (notwithstanding the massive success of competitive pro-am dance shows on both sides of the Atlantic.)</p> <p>Curiously the three great American depression sports \u2013 pro wrestling, rollerderby and boxing \u2013 didn't wait for the new depression before reinventing themselves (the latter in the shape of mixed martial arts). </p> <p>Rollerderby \u2013 which has its roots in the 1930s \u2013 has dropped most of the nudge-nudge, wink-wink post-feminist mock-sexist gimmickry that marked its relaunch and has become an utterly thrilling proper sport that is way, way more exciting to watch live than baseball, American football (which it resembles in an exciting, speeded-up and less gay way) and basketball. And it's also starting to draw crowds from outside the hipster culture that gave it its rebirth. </p> <p>Bizarrely, big-time pro-wrestling might have already peaked. Many who were attracted to the oh-my-gosh silliness of the scripted sport's 21st-century relaunch were put off by the introduction of soap style storylines that stretched the acting abilities of the athletes to breaking point and beyond. </p> <p>But the good news is that many of those thus disaffected started \"backyard\" wrestling schools of their own. There's hardly a town of any size in America where one can't find a wrestling show featuring men dressed as Japanese supermonsters, or where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/mar/05/cricket.stevenwells\">unitarded dudes</a> (who apparently cannot afford either the steroids or the sunbeds) fight off an attack by \"a local ninja school\" using real baseball bats wrapped in real barbed wire caked in real blood. These guys probably wouldn't even notice a depression. </p> <p>But my big tip for the US sport that's set to go global if the economy prolapses? <a href=\"http://www.kickball.com/\">Kickball</a>. For the uninitiated (meaning everyone who has never attended an American high school) kickball is almost exactly like baseball except that its played with a large inflatable ball that is kicked, rather than hit with a bat. </p> <p>Now I know what you're thinking. And you are right. Both as a spectacle and a recreational activity, kickball is vastly superior to baseball (in fact the continued existence of baseball in the wake of kickball's invention puts one in mind of a lungfish that, having developed legs, steadfastly refuses to use them.)</p> <p>Kickball is one of those fantastic American things \u2013 like high school football marching bands and Title IX and garbage disposal units \u2013 that Americans don't realise are wonderful and thus never try to export. Instead they try to export gridiron, which is pointless if you've got rugby. And \"liberty\", which is actually (and this will shock most Americans) pretty widespread in Europe and actually much cheaper if you buy it from Sweden (although you do have to take it home and construct it yourself, which can be infuriating.) </p> <p>Americans, alas, are so blinkered by baseball and, as a rule, so incorrigibly provincial, that they'll probably never realise the glory of kickball. So I'll do it for them. </p> <p><strong>REASONS KICKBALL LIKE TODALLY ROCKS</strong><br>\u2022 You can play it equally well drunk or sober.<br>\u2022 It requires almost zero equipment.<br>\u2022 It combines the spending-most-of-the-game-hanging-around-with-your-mates-having-a-bit-of-a-natteryness of rounders and cricket with the visceral kickyness of soccer.<br>\u2022 It's totally co-ed. <br>\u2022 It's totally jock free. <br>\u2022 It's utterly devoid of willy-waggling gender baggage.<br>\u2022 So there are no needle-dicked nimrods desperately trying to prove that they're neither a homosexual nor a woman by being very, very good at a game. And shouting. <br>\u2022 Booze, sunshine, attractive young people of several genders and sexual orientations glowing with vodka and light exercise. And nobody gives a toss if you're rubbish. If they play a sport in heaven, it is kickball. </p> <p>I eventually give up trying to find a USAian who can step outside of their own USAishness for a moment and give me a quote on the wonderful and uniquely American Americanyness of kickball. You know - look at things like a foreigner. The very idea that there were countries where people don't automatically play kickball in the playground at break time seems to simultaneously shock and baffle American kickballers. Mouths freeze. Eyes glaze over. Arooga arooga sirens go off. Men in brown overalls arrive to carry them, stiff as a board, back to the depot for rebooting</p> <p>\"It's a game for drunks and incompetents,\" one sports journalist told me. \"And maybe amputees. I am appalled you are writing about it. I am ashamed I even know you. Don't use my name, I don't want anybody googling xxxx xxxxxx and kickball.\" </p> <p>I attended a kickball tournament in Philadelphia two weeks ago. The players were mostly young, bright, lower-middle-class 20-somethings in the not terribly well paid floppy white collar jobs that exist all over the US in the wake of 27 years of voodoo-Reaganomics. These are people who are hardly rewarded at all by the current economic system and who are thus unlikely to suffer any major trauma should that same system have a nervous breakdown. </p> <p>In short, the hipster sports \u2013 like alleycat bike racing and bike polo and kickball \u2013 that are played by the already economically disadvantaged and which eschew easily fossilised, top-down, workplace and/or geographic community based organisational structures, are superbly positioned to ride out an economic depression. </p> <p>Plus if a sport doesn't cost anything, there's no reason for anybody to cut it from their budget. The cheap will inherit the earth. </p> <p>Oh, by the way, the team that won the kickball tournament? They hung a hammer and sickle flag in their dug-out, wore red shirts and called themselves the Bolsheviks. End of history my arse.</p>",
  "<p>The tearful revelations by Stefan Petzner that he and his boss, the late rightwing populist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/jorg-haider\">J\u00f6rg Haider</a>, were lovers has sent Austria into a spin and plunged into disarray a party that three weeks ago celebrated its biggest ever electoral victory. </p> <p>Petzner, who remains the spokesman of Haider's anti-immigration Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ\u00d6) but as of yesterday who was sidelined as Haider's successor, has added a new twist to the mystery surrounding the true character of Austria's most controversial post-war politician.</p> <p>If his party's projection of him is to be believed, he was a family man, a loyal husband, a father to two daughters, a sporty, clean-living, almost teetotal maverick - an image that Haider and his followers wanted to project at all costs to keep their ultra-conservative voters on side. It is an image that might have remained intact and gone with him to the grave had the 58-year-old not died the way he did - speeding while drunk on the night of October 11. </p> <p>An attempt to reconstruct his final hours has revealed his last port of call before driving off in his VW Phaeton was Klagenfurt's most popular gay bar, Stadtkramer.</p> <p>The last picture of the governor of Carinthia shows him propping up the bar with an unknown man - in front of them an array of vodka, whiskey and Red Bull bottles.</p> <p>The details were in themselves not enough to provoke serious consideration of rumours since the early 1990s that Haider was gay or bisexual. What dominated the chat shows was the issue of politicians' drinking habits.</p> <p>Haider was mourned in grand style, given a state funeral that was broadcast live on television and referred to as \"the father of our province\". His passing was compared to the end of the world. \"The sun has fallen from the sky, our clocks have stopped,\" Gerhard D\u00f6rfler, Haider's successor as the governor of Carinthia, told the 30,000 mourners.</p> <p>But it was Petzner's choked and repeated disclosure that Haider had been his \"lebensmensch\" - the man of his life - that got Austrians talking.</p> <p>\"It was love,\" he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLYdJ2dPK5Q\">told a radio breakfast show</a>. \"We had a relationship that went far beyond friendship. J\u00f6rg and I were bound by something really special.\"</p> <p>Haider, he said, despite his 58 years, had an \"inner child\". He, Petzner, despite his relative youth, was a \"mature soul\", according to Haider. The combination, Petzner said, was what \"made the relationship so special\". He agreed with the interviewer's suggestion that Haider had gone to a better place and was now his \"guardian angel\".</p> <p>Then there was the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMDBd05Fl-w\">emotional press conference</a> he hosted in which the tears continued to flow. </p> <p>\"I've lost my best friend. He was not only my boss but my partner and together we had wonderful times,\" he said, describing the attraction to Haider as \"magnetic\".</p> <p>The Austrian commentator and video blogger Robert Misik is sensible to ask: \"<a href=\"http://www.taz.de/1/leben/koepfe/artikel/1/joerg-haider-und-die-maenner/\">Is all of this politically relevant</a>?\"</p> <p>Certainly, yes. As an MP Haider voted against lowering the age of consent for homosexuals. He represented a brand of ultra-conservative politics that railed against everything that was not traditional or mainstream.</p> <p>Gay rights groups and Austrian intellectuals rowed for years over whether to out Haidar. One argument in favour was that it would damage him politically. Against it was the fear that it would increase homophobia in an already staunchly conservative country. </p> <p>Answering his own question, Misik says: \"Of course it has a bearing on who Haider the public person was.\" And it goes some way to help explain his magnetism. \"He had a personal charm that clearly had a particular effect on men in their early 20s, who he gathered around him and hoisted into the highest offices at a very young age.\"</p> <p>His homoerotic lure was clear. I remember <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/31/kateconnolly\">his 50th birthday celebrations</a> up a mountain near Villach. It was a most typical Haider affair. He was surrounded the entire day by an entourage of well-dressed, perma-tanned male supporters who looked like Haider clones. It is they who gave Haider's BZ\u00d6, and before that, his Freedom party (FP\u00d6), the euphemistic nickname of the \"buberl partei\" - the party of little boys. It is the undying loyalty of such figures, often referred to as the \"briefcase carriers\", that helped Haider succeed for so long.</p> <p>Well known for providing acerbic anti-Haider remarks is the Nobel prizewinning Austrian author Elfriede Jelinek. In a new essay that has just appeared on her <a href=\"http://www.elfriedejelinek.com\">website</a>, she goes so far as to compare Haider to a \"saviour\" with religious powers, referring to his followers as the \"lads from the farms with their red faces, browned by artificial sun ... they have now been orphaned\". </p> <p>Egyd Gst\u00e4ttner, one of Carinthia's most famous authors, commentators and Haider critics, has no qualms about calling the outpouring of grief a continuation of the \"f\u00fchrer kult\" Haider enjoyed in life.</p> <p>\"The BZ\u00d6 is more like a fan club that had one f\u00fchrer who determined everything down to the loo paper at party headquarters without anyone objecting to him,\" he says.</p> <p>He thinks it is a very Austrian attitude - the \"Fritzl phenomenon\", Gst\u00e4ttner calls it, referring to the builder who kept his daughter in his cellar as a sex slave for 24 years. \"He had such power no one dared question him and simply accepted the way things were.\"</p> <p>The one-man party theory is the reason given by many politologists to predict that Haider's BZ\u00d6 is unlikely to survive long, despite securing 10% of the nation's vote three weeks ago. \"The afterglow will still be felt after a couple of years, but a party cannot survive forever based around a mythical figure,\" says Richard Brem, editor in chief of the politics and youth culture website <a href=\"http://www.screenkids.tv\">screenkids.tv</a>.</p> <p>It is most likely that the BZ\u00d6, which broke away from the FP\u00d6, will be subsumed into the original party once more. That scenario is considered even more likely after Petzner's emotional outburst led to him losing his job as BZ\u00d6 leader yesterday to a rather uninspiring divorced father of two.</p> <p>If the BZ\u00d6 had thought of its own longevity, says the political analyst Peter Filzmaier, it would have done more to persuade Haider's widow, Claudia, 52, to take the reins. The softly spoken, socially engaged woman, he says, would have been a \"leveller\" after the \"larger-than-life\" Haider, and would have maintained the Haider brand and mythology, thus keeping traditional supporters on board. \"She would be the only candidate no one could object to,\" Filzmaier says.</p> <p>Rightwing websites, meanwhile, are full of conspiracy theories suggesting Haider was murdered. Greek myths have been drawn on - after all, he was driving a Phaeton.</p> <p>One theory suggests a spurious numerological link between Haider's death and 9/11. Another, from a former Haider disciple, suggests he was murdered by Mossad - which fits neatly into his oft-expressed belief in a Jewish world domination theory and gives further fuel to the party's antisemitic views.</p> <p>In short, it's hard for many to accept that the Haider myth is mortal. For now, the family has delayed cremating his remains pending further forensic tests as to the cause of death. Whether it wants to or not, Austria is not likely to succeed in burying J\u00f6rg Haider any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>I arrived in Tampa Bay (not really, as I'll explain) with high expectations for the World Series between the Rays and Philadelphia Phillies, but wasn't nearly as optimistic about the city itself. Would it measure up to baseball capitals such as Chicago and New York in terms of municipal playoff atmosphere? No chance, I thought, as we drove down Interstate 275, but damn the weather is great. </p> <p>It's my first trip to this part of Florida, so coming in I knew very little about it. My Gulf Coast education began almost instantly over a plate of fried alligator nuggets. Nobody lives in \"Tampa Bay\" except for fish and manatees, just call it \"Tampa\", the waitress at Crab Billy's told me. For years, myself and other ignoramuses referred to the city as Tampa Bay, because the Rays, the NFL's Buccaneers and the NHL's Lightning all include Tampa Bay as part of their franchise name. What else are people whose lives revolve around sports supposed to think it's called?</p> <p>What is known as the Tampa Bay area actually represents a region of three cities on Florida's northern Gulf of Mexico coast: Tampa, St Petersburg and Clearwater. For us outsiders this is pretty complicated, especially when you learn that the Rays don't play in Tampa Bay, which we now know is impossible, and that the club isn't even located in Tampa, but rather in St Petersburg.</p> <p>It wasn't long after our geography class that myself and the Five television crew ventured out to explore the region. In visiting all three local cities we covered over 80 miles, crisscrossing the Bay on the seemingly endless roads and causeways which provide access to the kitschy Gulf motels, high-rise hotels and condos, and \"downtown\" business districts. </p> <p>Since the region of over four million people is so spread out, most seem to spend the bulk of their time either in the car or indoors - we saw very few people walking the streets, which was a bit spooky. Such conditions are not conducive to that in your face, uptight north-east playoff frenzy that takes over a city such as Boston. There are some \"Go Rays\" signs scattered around, but that's about it. </p> <p>This is disappointing until you get to the ballpark. What the area lacks in around-town enthusiasm is made up for when fans, scattered throughout this vast region, unite at Tropicana Field. The Rays are just over 10 years old, but the baseball knowledge of their supporters is first-rate. The atmosphere inside Tropicana Field (which by the way, isn't that bad a venue for a domed stadium) is electric, and unlike some other more established baseball cities, the savvy crowd, well versed in hardball's intricacies, doesn't need to be told when to cheer - they're just fine on their own.</p> <p>It's not that Rays fans are quick learners, they've actually had big-league baseball in the region since 1914, the year that MLB teams began coming down here for spring training. That's why there was a healthy smattering of Phillies red in the crowd during Games One and Two - nearby Clearwater has been Philadelphia's spring home for 64 years. </p> <p>Perhaps the days of locals supporting teams they watch during spring training are numbered. After an extremely slow start, which had plenty to do with prodigious losing, the Rays fan base is growing rapidly; such is the power of a World Series appearance. The park is packed with young fans whose parents have finally gotten behind the club. Those kids' early baseball memories will be less about lazy March afternoons at the Yankees training facility, and more about these Rays, who are looking to go from the outhouse to the penthouse in their first ever Fall Classic. </p> <p>Those on the bandwagon have plenty to cheer about after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7917413\">the Rays evened the series at one with a 4-2 victory over Philadelphia in Game Two</a>. Tampa Bay hit 16 home runs against Boston in seven ALCS games, but on Thursday their win came mostly as a result of \"small ball\", scoring runs without homers and extra-base hits. It was a game the Rays badly needed after losing a tight encounter in the series opener. Their young pitching phenom, David Price, so vital in the final game against the Red Sox, came on again to record key outs, sealing the win for Rays starter James Shields. </p> <p>The Phillies 3-2 Game One victory was all about the Phillies pitching staff and an early two-run blast from Chase Utley. Starting pitcher Cole Hamels was top class, while relievers Ryan Madsen and closer Brad Lidge were once again untouchable in support of their ace. </p> <p>Both teams have yet to assert their offense, but the Phillies have been particularly bad. They failed to cash in on multiple scoring opportunities for the second straight night, and were 1-15 with runners on base, a major cause for concern. With in-form starting pitcher Matt Garza up next for the Rays, Philadelphia's bats will have their work cut out for them.</p> <p>It's been five years since the Fall Classic has gone beyond five games, so we are starving for a series that stretches as many innings as possible. After all, the best-of-seven set is the crown jewel of the sport; dramatic twists and turns should be the prerequisite for such a stage. Thus far we've had two relatively tight contests, and as the series shifts to Philadelphia for three games, I'm hoping that we're in for the long haul and that the series we've been waiting for has finally arrived. </p> <p>\u2022 Five's live coverage of the World Series continues on Saturday night with Game Three beginning at 1am.</p>",
  "<p>Next week heralds a second wave of new autumn TV shows, with ITV1's <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/Drama/family/BritanniaHigh/?cmpid=PPC_GOOGLE_Britannia%20High_Pure%20Brand_britannia%20high&amp;ps\">Britannia High</a>, BBC1's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/littledorrit/\">Little Dorrit</a> and E4's <a href=\"http://www.e4.com/deadset/\">Dead Set</a> all set to battle it out in the ratings.</p> <p>The major broadcasters will be hoping their new shows boost their performance more than their first set of autumn series after Barb figures showed that Channel Five was the only terrestrial outlet to increase its year on year share in September \u2013 the start of the new TV season.</p> <p>All the other four main terrestrial networks all had year on year audience share dips last month, with BBC1 down the most, although it held on to its position as the UK's most popular channel.</p> <p>Five was up from 4.9% in September 2007 to 5.1% this year and has also regularly been seeing its peaktime shows pass the 1 million mark \u2013 not a huge figure by the standards of the other four channels, but a rating that Five has often previously struggled in reaching.</p> <p>The network's big autumn shows so far have included <strong>Extreme Fishing with Robson Green</strong>, which became an unlikely hit, averaging 1.3 million. It will return for a new series next year. <br> BBC1 saw its September share fall from 22.6% last year to 20.8% this year while ITV1 was at 18.3%, down from 19.6% last year.</p> <p>BBC2 was on 7.6%, down from 7.9%, while Channel 4 came in at 7.4%, down slightly from 7.5% in September last year. </p> <p>However, its time-shift service Channel 4 +1 \u2013 the only one amongst the five terrestrials \u2013 pulled in a multichannel share of 0.8% for September, up from 0.5% in the same month last year.</p> <p>Among the hits of the new autumn season so far have been BBC1's costume drama <strong>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</strong>, which gained nearly 6 million viewers, while Saturday evening drama <strong>Merlin</strong> has been holding up well with more than 6 million.</p> <p>Veteran show <strong>Antiques Roadshow</strong> has also been reinvigorated since Fiona Bruce replaced Michael Aspel as host, hitting 8 million viewers on Sunday - its best audience for four years.</p> <p>Channel 4 had most success with Peter Kay's spoof reality TV show, <strong>Britain's Got the Pop Factor and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice</strong>, which pulled in 5.5 million \u2013 the channel's highest rating of the year.</p> <p>The channel's <strong>Secret Millionaire</strong> also did well, attracting around 4 million viewers; while <strong>Jamie's Ministry of Food</strong> averaged around 3 million.</p> <p>ITV1 has had problems with its new drama output for most of the year, although it seemed to hit its stride as autumn came around with <strong>Place of Execution</strong> gaining 6 million and the new series of <strong>Wire in the Blood</strong>, also starring Robson Green, pulling in the same figure.</p> <p>However, while it was critically acclaimed, <strong>Lost in Austen</strong> didn't perform as well as it could have, averaging under 4 million, and was soundly beaten by BBC1's genealogy show <strong>Who Do You Think You Are?</strong>.</p> <p>ITV1 talent show <strong>The X Factor</strong> has been performing more strongly than last year, launching with more than 10 million and turning the tables on BBC1's <strong>Strictly Come Dancing</strong>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one of the biggest losers of the new season has been <strong>Richard and Judy's New Position</strong>, the husband and wife team's new show for new UKTV channel Watch.</p> <p>The show launched with 100,000 then fell off a cliff, hitting just 45,000 two days later.</p> <p>Another turkey was ITV1's <strong>Natural Born Sellers</strong>, which slipped under 2 million in the 9pm slot on several occasions before being shunted to a late night slot.</p> <p>Sunday kicks off the next wave of new shows, with ITV1's High School Musical meets Fame series <strong>Britannia High</strong> launching at 6.15pm, while BBC1's next costume drama, <strong>Little Dorrit</strong>, following at 8pm.</p> <p>Monday is a big night, with E4's zombie drama <strong>Dead Set</strong>, written by Guardian columnist Charlie Brooker, the return of BBC2's <strong>Autumnwatch</strong> and BBC1's <strong>Spooks</strong>, as well as John Prescott's BBC2 documentary series \u2013 <strong>The Class System and Me</strong>.</p> <p>Tuesday sees the launch of Channel 4's <strong>Neil Morrissey's Ricky Business</strong>, where the actor sets up and runs a pub, while on Thursday Russell Brand's Ponderland also launches on Channel 4 on Thursday and US drama <strong>Life</strong> , starring Damian Lewis, arrives on ITV3 the same day.</p>",
  "<p>Lots of things are not meant to happen in respectable middle class homes: feeding the kids junk food; teenage pregnancy; domestic violence. Recession is one of them. But the comfortable heartlands of south east England are about to find out that economic downturn is no respecter of social class, any more than the first three.</p> <p>The 80s recession hit hardest in the industrial north and Midlands, and its victims were predominantly working class men: the sectors worst affected were manufacturing, mining and farming. This time, experts are forecasting 2 million jobless by Christmas, but the pattern will be very different. P45s will rain like confetti in London and its satellites in industries like banking, estate agency, retailing and leisure. Women, as well as men, are likely to find themselves heading for the dole office in the crunch of 2008, or to find straitened employers trying to row back on flexible working arrangements.</p> <p>Some commentators, including Lord Desai, the Labour peer, believe the recession will be prolonged, but essentially shallow, and that the effect on jobs will not be too bad because the people who will be thrown out of work this time are not, in his words, \"semi-skilled or manual workers\", but graduates, who are capable of self-employment. </p> <p>Absolute rubbish. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7683000/7683388.stm\">Lord Desai's opinion</a> is redolent of unconscious snobbery as well as unfounded optimism. I was a teenager living in the north-east in the 1980s and I know from personal experience that not everyone employed in industry then was a grimy, horny-handed manual toiler. Many who were made redundant \u2013 my own father among them \u2013 were highly skilled and well-qualified people. The problem then was not a lack of adaptability or capability on the part of the unemployed, it was lack of demand for their services. I suspect it will be the same now. </p> <p>A City headhunter told me that one of his rivals had been boasting that he had 90 super-bright former investment bankers on his books. When asked what he was going to do with them, his smile evaporated and he turned white. The middle class jobless are, as Lord Desai says, capable of self-employment \u2013 though it is hugely patronising to infer that working class people are not \u2013 but that is not an easy answer. In the 1980s, there were concerted efforts to encourage people to become entrepreneurs, but small business start-ups have a high failure rate under any economic conditions. The number of distressed businesses in the UK has exploded to more than 4,500 with \"critical\" problems, according to corporate restructuring experts <a href=\"http://www.begbies-traynor.com/\">Begbies Traynor</a>, from fewer than 800 in the same period last year. Anyone embarking on the self-employment route in the south east will be in for a struggle \u2013 and, er, how will they get the start-up capital? If a would-be entrepreneur is not lucky enough to have a large severance payment, they will find it very hard to borrow from a bank at a reasonable rate in the teeth of the credit crunch. </p> <p>There are a couple of reasons why unemployment might, just might, not be as bad this time as in the 1980s, when it hit a peak of 3 million. Thirty years ago industry was dominated by trade union muscle, and employers, encouraged by <a href=\"http://lists.econ.utah.edu/pipermail/rad-green/2004-May/014087.html\">Margaret Thatcher's battle against the mineworkers</a>, seized on the recession as a chance to cut manning, boost productivity and introduce more flexible labour practices. Old-style manufacturing was, and is, under threat from cheaper emerging markets. The labour market is far more flexible now, and the pressures to keep wages high are weaker. Migrant labour was also much less of a factor back then; this time, some of the lost jobs will be accounted for by migrant workers packing their bags.</p> <p>Unfortunately, even if those factors soften the blow, people don't have to be unemployed to be in financial trouble. In the 1980s, many men who had earned good pay as miners or in manufacturing jobs discovered that if they did find alternative employment, it did not pay as well \u2013 the old industrial trades were replaced by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McJob\">McJobs</a>.</p> <p>Thousands of employees in financial services, estate agency and the like will find it very difficult to replicate their old salary and bonus packages either in the same field or any other. Those who have geared to the hilt with extreme mortgages and credit card debt on the basis of pay deals they have no hope of attaining again will face severe difficulty, against a backdrop of house prices that are falling harder and faster in the south than the north.</p> <p>Some prosperous households will be cushioned against recession by their savings, but others, perhaps the majority, will not. Household debt rose to 170% of income at the end of last year, and the savings ratio \u2013 the percentage of income set aside \u2013 is at or close to zero. Plenty of outwardly well off middle class families are in reality only one or two salary slips away from financial disaster. </p> <p>It is not surprising that our deeply ingrained divisions over class and regional geography should colour our thinking about recession. The idea that real economic hardship is only for the northerners \u2013 they're gritty, they can cope \u2013 is a cultural cliche. But the notion that a southern middle class recession will somehow be nicer or less real than its working class counterpart is about as valid as <a href=\"http://www.johnbetjeman.com/\">John Betjeman</a>'s feeling that if the world were ending, he would want to be in the haberdashery department of that iconic middle England store, Peter Jones because surely nothing dreadful could happen there.</p> <p>The north will not escape. Cities like Leeds and Manchester are heavily dependent on financial services, retail and leisure for their regeneration. They were caught up in the buy-to-let property bug, and have thousands of new build city centre flats standing empty. There is no question that they will be badly affected too, as will Edinburgh and Glasgow. Both Labour and the Conservatives placed far too much reliance on the services sector, and financial services in particular, as the engines of our economic wellbeing. No one is seriously arguing that we turn the lights back on in the factories of yesteryear, but we should direct far more energy into promoting high value manufacturing, green technology, industrial design and engineering. </p> <p>The downturn in the early 90s did afflict the south, with a housing slump and small business failures, but this slump is likely to be of an entirely different order of magnitude: the <a href=\"http://www.niesr.ac.uk/pubs/review.php\">National Institute Economic Review</a> forecast this week that it will be the worst in the developed countries since 1982. There is no way that's not going to hurt.</p>",

We received sack loads of responses telling us all about your favourite places, from little-known ski spots, restaurants with views, the creamiest hot chocolate to the most memorable (or not) apr\u00e8s-ski nights.

The winner: High Tatras, Slovakia</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Peter Clarkson</strong><br>With budgets pinching more than the edge in the October air, it may be time to consider a trip beyond the usual Alpine haunts. The High Tatras mountains in Slovakia, a compact range rising out of a plateau, are served by an excellent light railway, allowing you to stay in one of many little towns at the mountains' feet, and cheaply move with ease between a variety of pistes.</p> <p>Mixing with vodka-soused Russians happy to ski or simply launch themselves bodily down the slopes, you will have to keep your wits about you if you stick to the long pistes of <a href=\"http://strbskepleso.com/ \">Strbske Pleso</a>, or the more demanding, if shorter, runs of Tatranska Lomnica. Filling up on hearty sausage and bean stew in one of the numerous chatas or mountain huts on the slopes, you may then need a jolt from a Turkish-style coffee thick with grounds and black as the night in this Unesco-protected and largely unspoiled region. </p> <p>Not for nothing are these and the neighbouring valleys known as the \"Slovak Paradise\". Forget centimetres - you might well end up wading chest-deep through the fresh snowfall of a morning, to dodge the few adventurous Germans you'll find on the wealth of off-piste runs. </p> <p>Getting there is as much an adventure as staying - easily reached by overnight trains from France, you'll change in Kosice, transferring to the electric railway to Stary Smokovec.</p> <h2> France</h2> <p><strong>2. La Grave</strong> <br>Posted by <strong>Jonathan Pughe</strong><br>It's not the most glamourous ski resort in France. It's not the most beautiful. It's not very easy to get to. And the lifts don't open very often. But when they do, there is no better place to ski. The mountain, La Meije, has everything including a vertical drop of nearly 2,500 metres. And you probably won't see more than 50 people all day long. You'll need a guide and you certainly need to be fit but there can be very few more rewarding skiing experiences in Europe. We stayed at <a href=\"http://www.hotel-edelweiss.com/index.php\">Hotel Edelweiss</a>, where everything from the welcoming bar to the hearty food and lip smackingly good wine list is excellent. </p> <p><strong>3. Bar\u00e8ges </strong><br>Posted by <strong>Zosia Kmietowicz</strong><br>My favourite resort is Bar\u00e8ges in the French Pyrenees. It is little known by the big tour operators and the companies that do serve the resort offer a level of flexibility that is rarely found. We were picked up from Pau airport and looked after all week by fantastic personnel from the unaptly named PMT (<a href=\"http://www.pyrenees.co.uk/\">Pyrenean Mountain Tours</a>), with ski touring and games for the children thrown in. The best thing about Bar\u00e8ges is it's unpretentious. Locals come in daily to ski and there's vast amounts of skiing to be had in the two linked resorts of Bar\u00e8ges and La Mongie. What could be better than hearing the whoop of children (and adults) as they navigate the bumps through the woods that border the pistes or the sight of the huskies at <a href=\"http://en.petitbarzun.nl/Pistes/le_lienz.htm\">Le Leinz</a> which also boasts a fantastic restaurant. Then there's the spa in Bar\u00e8ges itself, a welcome soak at the end of the day with adults and children in one big pool. </p> <p><strong>4. Sainte Foy</strong> <br>Posted by <strong> William Ric</strong><br>I would highly recommend Sainte Foy in the French Alps. It is a perfect small-sized resort, not far from Val d'Is\u00e8re. It's where the ski instructors from the nearby big resorts come to off-piste. You can get a weekly ski pass that also lets you ski in the main resorts - ideal if you don't like staying in the homogenised centres. Thanks to strict planning all the buildings are low level in the traditional chalet style. It's very quiet at night but only about 20 minutes from Val if you fancy a social centre. Best restaurant is <a href=\"http://www.labergerie.tv/?lang=1\">La Bergerie</a>, by the main lift station - perfect for a special dinner with a menu of Savoyard specialities. </p> <p><strong>5. Budget stay in Serre Chevalier</strong><br>Posted by <strong> Sarah Skelton</strong><br>A great budget hotel in Serre Chevalier is <a href=\"http://www.hotel-dubez.com/\"> La Maison du Bez</a>. The average weekly price is \u20ac450 per person for half-board and the food is excellent. The decor is cozy alpine shabby-chic and could easily feature in Sawday's Special Places to Stay; it has an alpine bohemian feel. They also have apartments to rent in the building next door, which are equally elegant and comfortable. </p> <p><strong>6. The Wall, Avoriaz</strong><br><strong>Louise Doherty</strong><br>I never really came up against anything that truly challenged me until my first trip to Avoriaz last March, when we discovered La Chavanette, known as Le Mur Suisse, the Swiss Wall... or just <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=yfyKch2Kh1w&amp;NR=1\">The Wall</a>. It's so terrifyingly steep that you can't even see beyond the first 20 metres. It's classed as an \"orange\" run, which essentially means it's unclassifiable... worse than a black. The top of the run is so steep and narrow that skiers carve moguls the size of cars as they turn, to try and stop themselves tumbling into oblivion. The only sound from the top of the run is grating, scraping ice on skis. Or so I hear. I stayed in the cosy restaurant at the top of the Wall, furiously drinking vin chaud to work up the courage to go down, but never quite managed it. It didn't matter because from where I sat, perched between France and Switzerland, the views were amazing. Also, there was a real community feel as skiers and boarders of all nationalities huddled round, debating whether to go down and egging each other on. It was like hovering at the entrance to the scariest theme park ride in the world.</p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p><strong>7. A tasty tip on Chiesa</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Thomas Winter</strong><br>Chiesa is a lovely small resort with comforting runs and a nice cozy feel to it. This may be down to the local speciality (pizzoccheri) served in the various restaurants and cafes that adorn the mountain. This is a stupendously heavy dish of buckwheat pasta, cabbage and cheese (possibly some potatoes), which sounds and, to be honest, looks pretty unappetising, but which transforms into food perfection as you eat mouthful after mouthful. It gives you enough calorific energy to scale K2 in an afternoon. So dense is this repast, however, that an hour or so of inaction is inevitable after consumption. Being forced to sit in the mountain sunshine, soaking up the view, the serenity and the calories offered a blissful moment of calm.</p> <p><strong>8. Hot chocolate in Courmayeur</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Ollie Loach </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.maisonvieille.com/inglese/ESTATE_rifugio.asp\">La Maison Vieille</a> in Courmayeur is, unsurprisingly given the name, a beautiful stone walled rustic restaurant/cafe with phenomenal views to Mont Blanc. Thick, proper Italian hot chocolate makes this the pick of the bunch in a resort with more mountain restaurants than lifts.</p> <p><strong>9. Macugnaga</strong><br>Posted by<strong> Heather Atkinson</strong><br>Without doubt one of the best-kept secrets in skiing is <a href=\"http://www.macugnaga.it/eng_home.htm\">Macugnaga</a> in the Italian Alps. At the foot of the Monte Rosa, Europe's second highest mountain and only Himalayan-type mountain, nestles this small resort. It is just over the Monte Moro pass from Saas Fee, but is inaccessible from Switzerland except on foot in the summer. It is at the end of a long winding valley from Turin or Milan airports and is probably the most picturesque resort in Europe. Being remote, it isn't part of a huge ski system but none the less has enough runs for a good week for all but the most advanced skier. Most of the hotels are run by locals and the food is traditional Italian mountain food - wholesome, delicious and lots of it! The wine is excellent and cheap and, thanks to being off the beaten track, prices are among the best in Europe. The icing on the cake is the Monte Rosa at sunrise. Get up in time to see the first rays touch the side of the Monte Rosa and you'll see where it gets its name. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it, it's always stunning. </p> <h2>Austria</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338924165\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/st-anton-dropin.jpg\" alt=\"Putting on skis, St. Anton, Austria\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Anton, Austria.

Take the train to St Anton</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Chris White</strong> <br>St Anton was once a resort that was dominated by its railway station and train track accommodation, while village life was marooned on the opposite side of the valley from its main slopes and lifts. Not anymore. Now the old station is a pamper-paradise with indoor and outdoor swimming in a series of slate and stainless steel bubbling pools. But the train is still the only way to arrive in town. It glides coolly into the side of the valley and you emerge from the new station still in the heart of the town. Value-seekers can fly with <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/\">Ryanair</a> to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshafen\">Friedrichshafen</a>. From here, Deutsche Bahn (DB) trains skirt the frozen Lake Constance and within two hours, you can be walking down St Anton's cobbled main street. The train can be booked through DB's London office or on its <a href=\"http://www.bahn.de/international/view/en/index.shtml\">English website</a>. Trains run frequently and regularly - even when the roads are struggling on transfer day. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338924166\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/skigluhweindropin.jpg\" alt=\"Gluhwein\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Bonhommet/photocuisine/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bonhommet/photocuisine/Corbis/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>11. Apr\u00e8s-ski in Obergurgl</strong><br>Posted by<strong>Ken Potter</strong><br>After a great day on the slopes, the twice-weekly Nederhutte experience is one not to be missed. The tip is to send someone to occupy your table at 3pm because by 4.30pm you'll have difficulty getting through the door, this really is a buzzing venue. The owner plays live music in two sessions. There are literally hundreds in there and you will be dancing on the tables playing air guitars. The atmosphere really is electric for everyone from six to 60 \u2013 we saw 60-year-old farmers dancing on the tables. Finding your skis and skiing down the mountain is a challenge but it is floodlit. </p> <p><strong>12. Top lunch spot in Zell Am See</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Elliott Justice</strong><br>If you fancy a spot of lunch on the mountain, try the <a href=\"http://www.sbg.at/pinzgauer-huette/\">Pinzgauer H\u00fctte</a> for beautiful scenery and a novel transfer back to the slopes. Take the gondola to the top of the Schmittenh\u00f6he and ski down the backside until you reach a small three-man lift on the left. Near the entrance to the lift lies a cat track that disappears off into the woods with no signage other than a warning picture of a skidoo. We would never have gone down this trail if we weren't with a local. Follow the trail for about half a mile through gladed scenery until the trees open out to the Pinzgauer H\u00fctte. The crystal clear view from here includes the valley below and the huge Kitzsteinhorn glacier. The most amazing and fun thing about this wonderful eatery is the novel way in which you return to the slopes. Once there are enough people waiting to leave, the old man, who appears to be the owner, will pull out a long rope with bars attached to it, hook it to the back of his skidoo and literally drag you in tow, all the way back to the piste. Amazing experience! </p> <h2> Switzerland</h2> <p><strong> 13. Bruson</strong><br><strong>Rory Creedon</strong><br>Vernier is nice, Siviez is great, but in that epic area of the Four Valleys, Switzerland, there is one resort where those who are really in the know go: <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=6keD_UOsAOY\">Bruson</a>. Best of all the easiest way to get there is by train. Book your <a href=\"http://www.eurostar.com/dynamic/index.jsp\">Eurostar</a> to Paris early and it will cost you around \u00a350 return, the journey to Geneva another \u00a350, and the last leg to La Chable will cost you \u00a320. In peak season, this is much cheaper and greener than flying - and best of all more glamorous. Stop for lunch in Paris, take in the sights of Lake Leman. When you arrive in Le Ch\u00e2ble, there is a simple choice, turn left for Verbier and turn right for Bruson. I respect your decision to turn left - Verbier is young, hip, busy, fun, while Bruson is quiet, traditional, small, rustic and has far fewer amenities. However, once you are ensconced in your \u00a31,500 a week apartment 100m from Verbier's Place Centrale, if you look out of your window one evening and you see delicate flakes of snow falling from the grey clouds, forget trying to get up into the Verbier Valley the next day. Instead, hire some fat skis and take the cable car down to Le Ch\u00e2ble from Medran. Once there, catch the bus to Bruson. Having endured two of the slowest (and coldest) chairlifts known to modern man, you will arrive at a plethora of easily accessible and relatively safe off-piste runs. You might see one or two other people there, and you will ski in untracked power all day long. Stop for a croute in a mountain hut and ski all the way to Le Ch\u00e2ble in the afternoon, over fields and down mountain paths. You will return happy and exhausted.</p> <p><strong>14. Ch\u00e2teau-d'Oex </strong><br>Posted by <strong>Edwina Meek</strong><br>Go during the hot air ballooning festival in mid January. It really is magical, hundreds of multi-coloured balloons high above the mountains. The skiing is fantastic, too. Taking a beautiful wooden-pannelled carriage to Gstaad only takes about 20 minutes and the scenery is outstanding. The skiing is extensive and the slopes were all but empty in early January. Wonderful scenery, fantastic mountainside restaurants and (if you have the inclination) a trip in a hot air balloon over it all, makes <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5ggr94\">Ch\u00e2teau-d'Oex</a> very special! </p> <h2>US</h2> <p><strong>15. Grand Targhee Resort in Wyoming </strong><br>Posted by <strong> Michael Mueller</strong><br>Located within the Caribou/Tarhgee National Forest, <a href=\"http://www.grandtarghee.com\">Targhee</a> is dedicated to fantastic, uncluttered old-school skiing. It combines an annual average of 500 inches of world-class powder, genuine \"old west\" charm, marvellous off-the-beaten-tracks and non-existent lift lines, with easy accessibility from the nearby, but much flashier Jackson Hole. Mostly locals come here to the snowier, western side of the Teton range, for unlimited elbow room and spectacular powder. Among Targhee's 2,000 pristine, mostly off-piste acres, there are easy groomers from top to bottom. But the best runs include untracked double blacks, vast meadows and glades, and more than 1,000 acres of back country cat skiing powder, along with incredible unspoiled views and bluebird skies. The base is a compact \"western\" version of an alpine village offering everything from equipment rentals, buffalo wings, local micro brews to live music at the very laid back Trap Bar. Getting there: Several major airlines make daily stops in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Rent a car or SUV and drive west for approximately 1.5 hours over the Teton Pass to Driggs, Wyoming, and follow the signs. </p> <p><strong>16. Backcountry in Idaho</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Seonaid Cook</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.svtrek.com/\">Sun Valley Trekking</a> run hut-to-hut (in fact, yurt-to-yurt) backcountry ski trips in Idaho. Stunning mountain ranges, a chance to escape the usual resort-based clich\u00e9s and the possibility of bumping into one of the incredibly famous (seasonal) residents add an extra dimension to a trip. To relax afterwards, soak tired thighs in one of the natural thermal springs at the roadside then drink a schooner (very large beer to you and me) at Grumpy's in Ketchum. </p> <h2> Canada</h2> <p><strong>17. <a href=\"http://www.redresort.com/\">Red Mountain</a> run</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Adam Rostom</strong><br>This medium-sized conical hill is a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=M_a3Agvte28\">rollercoaster ride of a mountain</a>. From the top you've got 200m of open powder before you hit the tree line. After frantically zigzagging through the trees, you arrive at the first rock band; what most normal people call a cliff. After 5-10m of air, you thud back on to the ground for the next batch of trees and then the second rock band. More air, more trees and you find yourself at the bottom, whooping like an idiot for no bigger reason than pure exhilaration and cursing the rickety lift for its slowness. All you want to do is go again. The run is called Powderfields and is near a sleepy little BC town called <a href=\"http://www.rossland.com/\"> Rossland</a>. It's the best place in the world.</p> <p><strong>18. Tree-skiing in Whistler-Blackcomb</strong><br>Posted by <strong>James Robinson</strong><br>Take the Jersey Cream Lift, and head from there past the Rendezvous restaurant, heading back towards the top of the Excelerator chair. The <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NvPIUjHkw\">runs</a> divide around a tree island, known to the locals as Backpacker Trees. You need to straight-line it towards a large sign, down and up a short gully - keep pointing it - and then you'll be in a small but perfectly formed section of rolling terrain, with small drop-offs and sweeping banks, perfect for introducing new people to the joys of tree-skiing in the Coastal Range. Watch out for the local instructors though, they head here first too!</p> <h2>Andorra</h2> <p><strong>19. Late-season weekend in Arcalis, Andorra</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Alun Evans</strong><br>Despite now boasting two \"super-resorts\" and several hundred miles of skiable pistes, Andorra still finds it hard to shake off the \"Ibiza in winter\" tag. However, my top tip is to leave the main valley resorts of Soldeu and Pas de la Casa to the hordes, and go exploring in the <a href=\"http://en.vallnord.com/\">Vallnord</a>. It consists of three resorts, Pal, Arinsal and Arcalis, which all share the same lift pass. While Pal and Arinsal are great for beginners and intermediates, the real jewel in the crown for the more experienced skier is the small resort of Arcalis. Its location, right at the very north-western tip of Andorra, means that the usual weather systems dump their snow here before hitting the rest of the principality. So, the average snow depth is usually double that of the other resorts, and it gets lots of powder. It only has five or six lifts, but each one is modern, fast and very long. This all adds up to lots of skiing on long runs, in some cases from the very top of the resort (2,625m) down to the bottom in one hit. But the real clincher is the late season prices. During the high season, Vallnord can be quite expensive as the northern Spanish take their winter holidays, but in March and April prices plummet. Last April, we found two nights' accommodation in a <a href=\"http://www.anyospark.com\">four-star spa</a>, half board, and a two-day lift pass, for \u20ac120 (\u00a395, booked last minute through the <a href=\"http://en.vallnord.com/index.asp\">resort website</a>). Budget flights go to Barcelona and Girona in Spain, and Toulouse in France. Travel time from either to Vallnord is two to three hours. Car hire: Spanish rates are good, try <a href=\"http://www.pepecar.com\">pepecar.com</a> for deals. </p> <h2>Finland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338924167\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/northernfinland-dropin.jpg\" alt=\"Cross-Country Skier in Northern Finland\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cross country skiing in Finland.

Levi </strong><br>Posted by <strong>Clare Strode</strong><br>Most skiers will baulk at this one but what <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=MU08chkwOO4&amp;feature=related\">Levi</a> lacks in glamour and stunning peaks it more than makes up for with an un-crowded, unpretentious and delightful skiing experience for novices (like me) or those with young families. It's a fantastic place to learn or develop your skiing without the stress of the crowds bearing down on you on the piste. Throw into the mix the Aurora Borealis, the reindeers in the forest (how many people can say they've skied through reindeer poo?) and the chance to take the afternoon off for a bit of husky sledging. I've gone with a few people over the years and despite their initial misgivings the charm of this place wins them over. The nightlife may not compete with the French or Italian resorts, but where else can you indulge in a night-time snowmobile spin through an Arctic forest?</p> <h2>21. Norway</h2> <p><strong>Kongsberg</strong> <br>Posted by <strong>Peter Jones </strong><br>Excellent for beginners on a budget. Fly with Ryanair to Torp (Oslo), then get a train to Kongsberg (always on time, walk-on fare very cheap especially when you are with kids). Stay in the <a href=\"http://www.hihostels.com/dba/hostels-Kongsberg-042061.en.htm\">Kongsberg Youth Hostel</a> - excellent facilities and a cooked breakfast. Get a bus to the resort (very quick), and ski on one of the four runs, half pipe, moguls. </p> <h2>UK</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338924168\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/glencoe-scotland-dropin2.jpg\" alt=\"Black Rock Cottage in Glencoe, Scotland\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glencoe, Scotland.

A wee array of green, blue, red and black runs above, rusty uplifts, dilapidated wooden huts, cool music and the coolest instructors to show you how. Me, a 49-year-old beginner, with my ski instructor, a great bit of rough frae Fife: \"Aye, that's it, hen, brilliant, like this see \u2013 see \u2013 so we're dancin' we're no fighting, get it?\" I did.</p> <h2> Spain</h2> <p><strong>23. Cerler </strong><br>Posted by <strong>Leon Young</strong><br>One of the best small Spanish skiing resorts in the Pyrenees is <a href=\"http://www.cerler.com/\">Cerler</a>, near Benasque in the Aragon region. It isn't the grandest but it is the highest and one of the most beautiful. In addition, it is well off the beaten track and rarely busy. The best time for good snow is January and February - snow remains firm and skiable during the sunshine too, so it offers a rare chance to ski in a t-shirt and get a tan. There are fantastic restaurants in Cerler and Benasque itself. Local dishes mostly cater for carnivores - the steaks (chuleton) are unbeatable.</p> <h2>Poland</h2> <p><strong>24. Zakopane</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Nicky Power</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.zakopane-life.com/\">Zakopane</a> is the best place for an absolute beginner on a budget to learn to board or ski. It is a stunning historic village, with a real traditional feel. Both food and accommodation are really cheap and the Tatra mountains are simply beautiful. It is perfect for those who want to try snow sports, but do not want to pay a fortune in case they don't like it. You can rent a board for as little as \u00a34 a day. In addition, the beginner slopes offer a pay-as-you-go system, with short runs costing as little as 20p a go. I also had a whole day of one-to-one tuition for less than \u00a330. </p> <h2>Japan</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338929135\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/japan-sunset-dropin.jpg\" alt=\"Skiers watching the sunset, Japan\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skiers watching the sunset, Japan.

Skiing and apr\u00e8s-ski in Niseko</strong><br>Posted by <strong>Sam Faulkner</strong><br>Last year I skied in <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bNZaVbOrytA\">Niseko</a>, in Hokkaido, Japan - this is skiing unlike anywhere else. The snow is light and deep. You can ski through bamboo and around willow trees in untracked powder day after day. The slopes are not at all crowded but the infrastructure is a little old school. Apr\u00e8s-ski is uniquely Japanese: an onsen (fantastically relaxing, traditional Japanese bath) and a bowl of ramen. If you are serious about skiing and want to find somewhere completely different to tracked out slopes of Europe, head east..</p>",
  "<p>Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, said today that he stuck by his controversial promise that the government would not allow the UK's population to rise as high as 70 million.</p> <p>But Woolas denied that this amounted to a \"numerical cap\" on immigration, saying that it was a reassurance to the public that the government's new points-based system would ensure that the upward trend in population would be kept under control.</p> <p>The new minister, who has hit the headlines several times for alleged gaffes since being appointed to his current job in this month's reshuffle, denied he had been \"gagged\" after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/24/jacqui-smith-bbc-woolas\">withdrawing at the last minute from last night's Question Time</a> on BBC1.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his withdrawal was due to a government decision that it would be better to have a minister with economic responsibilities on the show, adding: \"I have just read that I've been gagged for two weeks, and yet here I am on your programme.\"</p> <p>Woolas said that there had been a series of predictions that on current trends the UK population was heading towards 70 million or more, from official statisticians, the European Union and the new cross-party parliamentary group on balanced migration headed by MPs Frank Field and Nicholas Soames.</p> <p>But he said that the \"tough\" new points-based system coming into effect next month, which will allocate work permits according to whether applicants have skills needed by the UK economy, will respond to these concerns - even though it will not affect migration from the EU, whose nationals have the right to work in Britain.</p> <p>Woolas said: \"We are introducing the biggest shake-up in immigration policy for 45 years ... that is based on a points system which allows the government to move the hurdles up and down - the criteria by which people can come into our country to work.</p> <p>\"That will allow us to control the population, to answer the worries that Frank Field and Nicholas Soames have been raising. That is not the same as a numerical cap. We don't think that's appropriate.\"</p> <p>Asked if he stood by his assurance that the government would not let the population rise from its current 61 million to 70 million or more, Woolas replied: \"Yes. There are projections from our own statistics office and from Europe and some MPs that show the population as increasing towards that sort of level.</p> <p>\"My point is that the points-based system we are introducing allows governments to influence the numbers of people coming into the country to work, and there are other changes we are making.</p> <p>\"I am trying to reassure the people who are worried about speculation about increased population that they don't have to worry. The figure of 70 million is not a figure of my choosing, it is a figure speculated by others.\"</p> <p>But he acknowledged: \"What you can't factor in is how many people leave the country and you can't figure in movement from Europe. That's why you can't put a precise figure on it, but we can reassure the public that the general trend will be controlled.\"</p>",
  "<p>A portrait \u2013 in poetry or painting \u2013 will seek to capture a likeness, but a likeness alone (however accurate) is not enough. The best portraits seem possessed by their subjects. Their wit, vigour, suffering, anger are not merely reflected but enacted every time the poem is read or the painting seen. The same is true of self-portraits, but they are much harder. We often mystify and misunderstand each other, but we are even more opaque to ourselves, so a powerful self-portrait is a work of exploration, an act of making. This often requires an imaginative leap (as with Neruda's Animal of Light), and the poems discussed below all make such leaps. Some are close to completion, others feel like work in progress, but they all \u2013 in different ways \u2013 do more than simply reflect. Without knowing the poets, it's impossible to say if their poems capture a likeness, but they all have a presence, and offer the reader a vivid encounter with a person. It's been a pleasure to read these self-portraits.</p> <p>Daniel Brint's poem I Have Become Detailed is an unsettling and effective self portrait set in a place where self-possession is hard to achieve.</p> <p><strong>I have become detailed by Daniel Brint</strong></p> <p>I have become detailed, imaged, resonated.<br>Machines, nurses, orderlies render the minutiae<br>Of nerve and stem, define a new, reflected self<br>Of unsuspected complexity. I am passed through tunnels,<br>My atoms sifted in darkened rooms,<br>Defective blood scrutinized objectively.<br>In spaces mirrorless and bright.<br>A child's face against a dusty window<br>Flapped open to the air, eyes remain<br>Where flesh has withered, a cold perfume<br>Of chemicals and odorless poisons \u2013<br>And now my father's face stares back,<br>As if, positioned at this nucleus of silence<br>Only extremes are revealed, and distances closed. </p> <p>The central phrase (and current title) \u2013 I have become detailed - is very arresting, and calls to mind Keith Douglas's remarkable poem Simplify Me When I'm Dead. In Daniel Brint's poem, the sense of a person being scanned, monitored, observed in clinical detail is very well evoked, as is the bewildering array of medical technologies. In its current form, the repetition of the title in the first line weakens the opening of the poem, but it's so effective in the first line that I'd consider changing the title. In a few places, the punctuation works against the poem, as with the full stop after \"objectively\" at the end of line six, and the capitals at the start of each line seem unnecessary in a poem like this. Poems will often gain (as do short stories) from an earlier exit point, and I was tempted to suggest ending this poem with the strong image of the father's face. However, the last two lines are powerful, and their language (especially \"nucleus of silence\") fits the poem well.</p> <p>Sarah Davies's poem is a quirky self portrait, seen through the arrival in her family of a dog, also called Sarah.</p> <p><strong>At fifteen, Mother called to me by the name of our dog by Sarah Davies</strong></p> <p>Sarah the daughter and Sarah the dog,<br>brindle bitch, dark tiger stripes and round her eyes, Cleopatra kohl<br>Her ribs, butterfly-folded, made you aware of what they were:<br>a cage for the heart </p> <p>Sarah would not bite; she barely barked<br>She used to shiver when she was touched, but became accustomed to it<br>Loved running and the ground raced to catch her up<br>Walked with grace three steps behind,<br>her head narrow enough to slip the collar, but she stayed<br>Looked like she could win a race, but the lines were barely pure enough<br>Gouge on her muzzle from a fast hunt</p> <p>She came to heel at the calling of her name,<br>given by the shelter girls; what a coincidence,<br>the same as the daughter of the house, though they<br>were never seen together</p> <p>She haunted the father and the brother,<br>pulled slightly on the lead when it was the mother walking<br>because she carried all the shadows of the house with her<br>When asked how Sarah was, this mother said <br>thin, nervous both: the girl, the dog.</p> <p>I'm a bit uncertain whether Sarah Davies intended At fifteen, mother called to me by the name of our dog to be the title of her poem or the first line. I think the long title (though I think long titles can be surprising and effective) doesn't work here because it gives away too much too soon. The poem describes very well the awkwardness of the daughter and dog having the same name, and the growing sense of similarity (\"thin, nervous both\") between them. The writing is spare and lucid, with occasional moments (\"barely pure enough / Gouge on her muzzle\u2026\") when it seems to lose its way. There is punctuation in the poem, but it isn't carried through and used consistently, and the poem suffers in places for that. I'd also look again at the integrity of some of the lines. A line like \"Looked like she could win a race, but the lines were barely pure enough\" is so long that it's hard to maintain a sense of rhythm and unity. I think the final stanza (especially \"she carried all the shadows of the house with her\") is beautifully judged.</p> <p>Dawn Hobbs's poem 7.15am is a portrait of youth and longing.</p> <p><strong>7.15 am by Dawn Hobbs</strong></p> <p>I drag my leather boots from under the bed,<br>my pink tights from the drawer,<br>and dress loosely;</p> <p>tie a silk scarf behind my head<br>and look into the mirror.<br>I see the reflection of the window,</p> <p>the avenue, the row of houses<br>on either side, down to where<br>they disappear in a blue haze</p> <p>to the North,<br>and wonder why I dress this way<br>when so few see me.</p> <p>I have a mind to travel<br>beyond the distant haze<br>to cities</p> <p>where, in bars and crowds and sleaziness<br>I can blend<br>and pout my lips</p> <p>and bore into the depths of old men's souls<br>with ice-blue eyes<br>(though mine are brown and smouldering)</p> <p>One day all this will happen;<br>but now I strip,<br>pull on my jeans</p> <p>my cotton shirt;<br>toss the leather boots back under the bed,<br>slip into cream shoes.</p> <p>Soon I will grab the sandwiches my mother has made,<br>kiss her,<br>leave to catch the 8.05.</p> <p>I like the way the whole scene is described through the mirror, and the story told through the detail of the choice of clothes, although the differences between the two outfits \u2013 at the beginning and end of the poem \u2013 could be clearer. The poem is particularly impressive when it looks deeper into the mirror, beyond the figure dressing, at the reflection of the window with its orderly rows of familiar houses and the \"blue haze\" beyond them with its promise of cities, \"bars and crowds and sleaziness\" and the future. The shift from the eyes in her imagined future to those in the mirror is effective, but some of the details in the poem could be pushed further, beyond the familiar territory of \"ice blue\" and \"smouldering\".</p> <p>Harriet Torr's poem Myself As Flea is an engaging portrait that owes something to John Donne's famous poem The Flea.</p> <p><strong>Myself As Flea by Harriet Torr</strong></p> <p>When I left the circus, <br>I took to walking the streets, <br>looking for skirt. I've followed <br>your crimson petticoats from day one, <br>there's no end to lace and tulle,<br>your flourish on park benches <br>when you sit catching the sun.<br>But one day, I followed a shadow<br>in the folds of your coat<br>and you carried me indoors. <br>I swell with blood and pride, <br>plan places for division, <br>separate aisles between the bed and post,<br>your soft folds like plums to my thistledown probe.</p> <p>This poem starts very well, with wit and swagger, and the play on \"looking for skirt\". Like Donne's poem, it describes a seduction, or an attempted seduction, but the swagger of the opening doesn't quite carry through. Most poems get tighter and shorter with redrafting, but I'd like to see this one get a little more expansive. I have a feeling that there's more to come from this poem, more detail and more swagger, carried by the voice of this sassy flea.</p>",

But conservatives have rallied to Palin's defence, and point to <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/richardminiter/2008/10/23/the-press-v-palin/\">hatred of Palin in the press</a> and among Democratic supporters such as these <a href=\"http://www.uncorrelated.com/2008/10/who_are_the_real_haters.html\">protesters in Colorado</a>. But there has been tension among Republicans this week bloggers in Colorado noted, flagging up how a <a href=\"http://www.pamshouseblend.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=7736\">McCain-Palin supporter brandished a gun</a> in a traffic incident after a rally in Grand Junction.</p> <p>Most of this reflects divides that have dominated American politics for the last 16 years, but the choice of Sarah Palin has also discouraged moderate Republicans. A veteran Republican I spoke to in New Mexico said that her choice <a href=\"http://lettersfromatory.wordpress.com/2008/10/23/palin-has-probably-robbed-mccain-of-the-presidency/\">undermined John McCain's message of experience</a>, which had been the central argument of his campaign all summer. </p> <p>The press now says that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/22/AR2008102203346.html?nav=rss_politics/elections\">McCain is fighting a \"Palin backlash\"</a>, and some analysts saw <a href=\"http://donklephant.com/2008/10/22/the-mccainpalin-nbc-interview/\">tension between McCain and Palin</a> during an interview this week. </p> <p>We're moving on from Colorado now. Next stop Kansas.</p>",
  "<p>New strip, October 2008. Click to enlarge.</p> <p><strong>Keith Hackett's official answers:</strong><br><strong>1) </strong>The home captain is right: you must change. You shouldn't have let it get this far. Before Premier League and Football League games the manager and the captain of both teams meet you in your dressing room. One of your tasks is to make sure there are no colour clashes: the law requires that all players wear colours that distinguish them from the officials. So you inspect the home and away outfield and goalkeeping strips, plus the tops that the subs will be wearing on the touchline, and decide whether to wear black, yellow or green. It's an important decision, which is sometimes rushed, so I have reminded referees to be aware of it. With the huge range of goalkeeping strips now in use, I'm also considering introducing a fourth coloured shirt for our officials. <br><em>Thanks to John Caley for the question.</em> <br><strong>2)</strong> Send the player off. He is guilty of violent conduct. After the game the player could ask for a personal hearing, claiming he did not realise what he was doing. With any head injury you must act quickly: signal for the medics to come on immediately (including, if necessary, the duty doctor and paramedics) and, where possible, keep other players away. In this situation, if you'd been able to keep other players back, the injured party would have had no-one to hit. <br><em>Thanks to Chris Kempshall for the question.</em><br><strong>3)</strong> No. The substitution is complete once you have given your permission, the player has left and the sub has come on. But you must still take disciplinary action. As well as giving the departed player his second yellow card you should also consider giving the incoming sub a yellow card for delaying the restart. But it would have been better to be proactive: when you stop play for a substitution you must stop your watch, and make that clear to players. So this player's tactics are achieving little other than winding people up. <br><em>Henning Furbach wins the shirt for this question. </em></p> <p>To submit a new question email <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk</a>.
