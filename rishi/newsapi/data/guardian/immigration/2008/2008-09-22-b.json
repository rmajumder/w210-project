  "<p>After the bemusing \"jokes\", the questionable tactics and the resounding defeat, the Ryder Cup captaincy of Nick Faldo finally stumbled across clarity yesterday morning as he and his players gathered in the lobby of their Louisville hotel. \"Officially no more,\" the Englishman barked before heading on to the airport bus.</p> <p>This was a typically brusque response to journalists seeking further reaction to Sunday's loss to Paul Azinger's US team but it can also be taken as the epitaph for Faldo's captaincy. It will never happen again. Officially.</p> <p>For one thing, there are no second acts in the life of a Ryder Cup captain these days. The great, the good and the apparently entitled of 1990s European tour golf are queueing up to assume the mantle of leadership, and the wheelbarrow full of sponsorship money that comes with it. Even if that were not the case, even if there were a public clamouring to have the six-times major champion back in 2010, the suspicion remains that those in charge of European tour golf would move heaven and earth to make sure it did not happen.</p> <p>Privately, the mere mention of Faldo's name in the presence of some of those in and around the 2008 European team is liable to produce eye-rolling on the scale of Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein. But in public, players and officials wrapped their arms protectively around their defeated skipper. \"That question doesn't even deserve an answer,\" interrupted his vice-captain, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, when Faldo was asked, perfectly reasonably, if he would find it personally difficult to come to terms with being the man in charge when Europe's long winning streak ended.</p> <p>It was the same story when Faldo was asked if he cared about the criticism that followed most of his tactical moves, from the decision to drop Lee Westwood and Sergio Garc\u00eda from the second day's foursomes, to the \"back loading\" of his singles line-up - a counter-intuitive gamble that he ultimately lost. \"About what do you think I care? That's a bit harsh,\" the captain mumbled, sounding like John Prescott on a bad day.</p> <p>This time Westwood jumped in on his behalf. \"We hold the golf clubs and we hit the shots, not the captain,\" the Englishman said. Such loyalty should be applauded but, equally, it should not be allowed to pass without noting that Westwood made clear his displeasure at being \"rested\" from Saturday's foursomes, apparently with blisters on his feet, saying: \"I would play in the Ryder Cup with my arm hanging off.\"</p> <p>As it turned out, and as Westwood added in his defence of the captain, Faldo got it right on Saturday morning with his team winning the session to reduce their first-day deficit from three points to two. The margin ought to have been reduced further in the afternoon when the Europeans generally outplayed their opponents but for no reward. Steve Stricker's holed 12-footer on the 18th green to steal a half-point from Garc\u00eda and Paul Casey was a mighty blow and sent the home side into Sunday's singles with a two-point advantage. \"Steve's putt was the decisive moment of the entire weekend,\" Azinger said on Sunday night.</p> <p>It is hard to know if the American captain was trying to be nice to his player with this remark, or nice to his old adversary Faldo. Whatever the case, he was talking arrant nonsense. Good though Stricker's putt may have been, its significance palled when measured against the European captain's decision to place what appeared to be his strongest players - Graeme McDowell, Ian Poulter, Westwood and Padraig Harrington - at the tail end of his line-up. \"Obviously with them being two points ahead, they can look in a different area to win. We've obviously got to make up those two points or hang on to their shirt-tails and not let them get away,\" Faldo said when asked to explain his thinking.</p> <p>Fair enough, but as master plans go this one was flawed, given that it ran the risk of ceding the early momentum on Sunday to the American team who had placed their strongest men at the top of the order. And so it proved. Europe managed to sneak a one-point advantage over the opening four singles matches, despite Garc\u00eda's humiliation at the hands of the ebullient Anthony Kim, but that was nowhere near enough to stem the tide or silence the cheers.</p> <p>Apparently, the players were allowed to choose where they played on Sunday, although given Faldo's insistence on controlling everything to do with this campaign - witness his decision to have just one vice-captain - this is extremely hard to believe. Whatever the case, there was a different approach in the US team room, where Azinger had a definite strategy which he imposed on his players.</p> <p>The US captain is not without his faults but no one can accuse him of lacking leadership. He was decisive when required, delegated when he needed to and lucky when it counted most. And when it was all over he could not have been more effusive about his players, or more anxious to ensure they received 100% of the credit for a marvellous effort. \"This wasn't about me,\" he said before detailing each player's contribution to the cause.</p> <p>Such indulgences are one of the privileges that fall to the winning captain. For the loser, there are no privileges, only duties, the most important of which is to take the ultimate responsibility for defeat. It was not surprising, although somehow appropriate, that Faldo failed miserably in this task, too.</p> <p>\"I'm incredibly proud of these 12 guys, and Ollie, of course, for my vice-captain. I've had an incredible experience,\" he said, reflecting on the week at Valhalla. \"We gave our heart and souls out there. We gave it 100%, and this particular week, you know, we were outplayed just marginally in different areas by America.\"</p> <p>Outplayed? Try out-captained, Nick.</p> <h2>Captain Cock-up or Captain Fantastic? Who scored what</h2> <p>Lawrence Donegan marks Nick Faldo's Ryder Cup report card</p> <p><strong>Wild-card picks</strong></p> <p>Those who criticised his decision to choose Ian Poulter as one of his two captain's picks were left looking rather foolish as the Englishman ended up as the top points scorer on either team. His other pick, Paul Casey, did just about enough to justify his selection, securing a half-point in his epic singles matches against Hunter Mahan. But would the experience of Darren Clarke made a difference? Possibly<br><strong>Verdict: Captain Fantastic</strong></p> <p><strong>Communication skills</strong></p> <p>A failed comedian until the end. \"See you in Wales,\" he said to the watching world in his closing ceremony speech. \"And bring your waterproofs with you.\" One wonders what Ryder Cup Wales 2010, which has spend millions in an effort to persuade the world to attend the event in two years' time, thought of this \"joke\"? For a man who earns his living in television, Faldo is remarkably uncomfortable in front of the media; bristling, defensive and, in his post-defeat press conference, unwilling to answer the most innocuous questions<br><strong>Verdict: Captain Cock-Up</strong></p> <p><strong>Pairings</strong></p> <p>Started badly when he inadvertently showed his proposed opening-day pairings to watching photographers. The decision to drop Sergio Garc\u00eda and Lee Westwood from Saturday morning's foursomes was vindicated by a 2\u00bd-point to 1\u00bd victory - the only session won by the European team. But he made mistakes on day one, failing to select the straight hitters Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez and Soren Hansen. Casey and Henrik Stenson are both better suited to fourballs and pairing them together in that crucial opening morning was an accident waiting to happen<br><strong>Verdict: Captain Cock-Up</strong></p> <p><strong>Singles line-up</strong></p> <p>While Paul Azinger arrived in the team room with a definite plan for the final day, Faldo went for the laissez-faire approach, allowing the players to chose where they wanted to play. That kind of thing might work in a hippy commune but this is the Ryder Cup, where leaders are meant to lead. Gambling is fine when you win, disastrous when you lose<br><strong>Verdict: Captain Cock-Up</strong></p> <p><strong>Match outcome</strong></p> <p>As Faldo was quick to point out in the aftermath of defeat, the final result was in doubt for about an hour on Sunday afternoon. If only Stenson had played better against Kenny Perry; if only Hansen had held it together against JB Holmes; if only ... \"It was only fractions,\" he said wanly, apparently forgetting that the details don't matter, the outcome does; that a beaten Ryder Cup captain is a bad Ryder Cup captain<br><strong>Verdict: Captain Cock-Up</strong></p>",
  "<p>A former Scotland Yard detective sergeant was jailed for 10 months yesterday for misusing his police credit card, spending tens of thousands of pounds on holidays in Thailand and Mexico and on a Premier League football club's executive box. The case is one of nearly 30 of alleged credit card misuse by Metropolitan police officers which have been referred for investigation in the last two years. </p> <p>Richard de Cadenet, 39, a former detective sergeant in specialist operations, which included anti-terrorism, pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office in June. Southwark crown court heard that, over a period of 15 months between July 2006 and October 2007, he spent more than \u00a373,000 on himself via an American Express card issued for use while on official business for the Metropolitan police.</p> <p>His expenditure included a holiday in Mexico, costing more than \u00a39,000, and one in Thailand worth more than \u00a36,000. He also used the card to buy \u00a33,500 worth of clothes and to pay for an executive box at a Premier League club. More than \u00a318,000 in cash was also withdrawn with the card and thousands were spent at supermarkets and in electrical goods stores.</p> <p>De Cadenet joined the Metropolitan police in 1996 after serving in the RAF. He was regarded as a high-flyer and was one of the officers involved in the investigation of the July 7 bombings. He was suspended in April this year and resigned shortly afterwards.</p> <p>David Levy, prosecuting, told the court De Cadenet was meant to use his credit card only for legitimate expenses such as travel on police business and hotel costs. The monthly checks on his expenditure on the card which should have been carried out had not taken place.</p> <p>Neil Saunders, defending, said De Cadenet had emerged as a \"class leader\" at Hendon police training college and his work had been highly regarded by his superiors. However, De Cadenet had experienced marital difficulties and developed a drink problem. He already had serious debts before his spending spree with the credit card began. \"He was buying what he thought was attention and affection,\" said Saunders.</p> <p>Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC told De Cadenet he would have to serve half of a 10-month sentence in prison and the remainder if he got into any further trouble within the overall period of the sentence. </p> <p>Deborah Glass, London commissioner for the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which oversaw the investigation, said: \"This was a serious misuse of the public's money. I hope the sentence reassures [Londoners] that abuse of the system will not be tolerated.\" </p> <p>The Metropolitan police has been auditing the expenditure on 3,500 corporate charge cards in use since 2006. To date, the Met's directorate of public standards has referred 25 cases regarding officers' use of their American Express charge cards to the IPCC and the Metropolitan police authority has referred a further two.</p>",
  "<p>From his office in the former capital of the confederacy, the mayor of Richmond, Doug Wilder, is relishing Virginia's moment in the presidential sun. On that very morning Barack Obama was campaigning in the military town of Norfolk in the south-east of the state while the Republican hopeful, John McCain, appeared with Sarah Palin in front of the biggest crowd he had yet seen in Fairfax, to the north. </p> <p>Two candidates on the same day in a state not seriously contested for the presidency in 44 years; Wilder, the state's former Democratic governor, does the maths and smiles. \"John McCain is here now,\" he says. \"You know why? Because he has to campaign in Virginia. He can't take it for granted.\"</p> <p>With its 13 electoral college votes Virginia is a weighty addition to the battleground states - roughly the equivalent of winning New Hampshire, Nevada and New Mexico together. It could not be closer. Of the last six polls both Obama and McCain have led in three each. To the south North Carolina is also shaping up to be a tight race. No Democrat has won there for 32 years and Bush took the state four years ago by 12 points. Obama has 31 offices in the state and the latest poll shows a tie.</p> <p>\"I see a crack in the solid South,\" says Wilder, the first African American to be elected as a state governor. \"I see a crack. And the fissure is taking place right here in Virginia ... to be considered a toss-up state this close to the election is amazing. We might influence North Carolina or Georgia. If we get either one of the states it's big.\"</p> <h2>Stunning victories</h2> <p>So far this fissure has failed to turn into a full-blown chasm. Polls in the summer showed Obama to be competitive in Texas, Mississippi, Georgia and Tennessee while holding narrow leads in South Carolina and Arkansas. Democrats recorded stunning byelection wins in Mississippi and Louisiana, prompting Time to run a cover proclaiming \"The End of the South\". But predictions of a full-scale remoulding of the region's electoral map have not been borne out. Obama pulled most of his staff and almost all of his advertising from Georgia a few weeks ago. Now he is focusing on North Carolina and Virginia.</p> <p>The McCain campaign has belittled these efforts as arrogance subsidised by deep pockets. They refused to counter Democrat efforts in Georgia, figuring that if they struggled there then the jig would be up everywhere. They dismiss Obama's campaigning in North Carolina as wishful thinking. </p> <p>\"It's just one more state where the Obama campaign has allowed its hubris to dictate spending decisions,\" Steve Schmidt, McCain's chief strategist, told the Associated Press. \"Soon you will see the Obama camp withdraw from North Carolina like you have seen them withdraw from other states.\"</p> <p>For all their affected nonchalance Republicans are spending almost as much money in North Carolina as the Democrats. \"North Carolina is teetering on the edge of being a swing state,\" said Ferrel Guillory, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina. \"If the Democrats continue to emphasise it and continue to advertise there they could keep it in play. But keeping it in play just means it's competitive. It doesn't mean they're going to win.\"</p> <p>Even this is no mean feat. Obama has poured in considerable resources here, flooding the area with ads, registering young and black voters at unprecedented rates and galvanising volunteers. Within 30 miles of Raleigh yesterday there were seven Obama events, involving canvassing, voter registration and phone banking. Obama was in Charlotte on Sunday; his wife, Michelle, was in the state on Thursday. McCain has not visited the state in months, his campaign has just 13 offices and nothing planned for yesterday. \"You just don't see the McCain people anywhere,\" says Betsy Muse, a frontpage blogger for the liberal site BlueNC and an Obama volunteer.</p> <p>Back in Richmond volunteers turn up at Broad Rock Library on many a weeknight, to collect campaign materials to go canvassing and registering. Obama has been hoping that this ground game of person-to-person contact will counter the Republican machine. The voter registration drives seem to be paying off. Virginia has seen more than 250,000 more voters registered since January. Most of this rise has taken place in Democratic counties. In North Carolina Democratic registration has leaped 7% while Republicans have risen 1%. The young and the black are over-represented in the increases.</p> <p>Registering young and black voters is one thing. Getting them to the polls is another. This is one reason why the polls have been particularly unreliable. </p> <p>Another reason is that it is difficult to know whether all voters are telling the truth. \"The Bubba vote is there,\" former Republican House majority leader Dick Armey told USA Today recently. \"And it's very real ... there's an awful lot of people in America, bless their heart, who simply are not emotionally prepared to vote for a black man.\" </p> <h2>Unreliable polls</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337883633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/9/23/1222157024399/electiongraph.jpg\" alt=\"The South's vote\" width=\"203\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The South's vote</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Armey says those voters are \"invisible\" in the polls because they would not admit they opposed Obama because of his race. \"I really want to say it's not going to play a big role,\" said Muse. \"But it is.\" Given how central race has been to the political realignment in the region it's hard to see how it could not. </p> <p>Until the 60s the South was the most reliable Democratic area in the country - but Southern Democrats were the most forceful supporters of racial segregation. As the civil rights movement emerged the Republicans sensed an opportunity. In 1961 Barry Goldwater launched the Republican \"Southern strategy\" in Atlanta. \"We're not going to get the Negro vote as a bloc in 1964,\" he declared, \"so we ought to go hunting where the ducks are.\" The party made an explicit appeal to white racism. When the then Democratic president Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964 civil rights act he said: \"We have lost the South for a generation.\"</p> <p>\"There's not a lot of love for Obama in many of these white Democratic strongholds,\" said Chris Kromm, the executive director of the Institute for Southern Studies. \"I've seen these older, white Hillary supporters say they'll vote for him because he's on their team. But you don't know how many of those McCain is going to be able to pick off.\"</p> <h2>Charmless</h2> <p>McCain has problems here, too. While his war record goes down well, many southerners view him as insufficiently pious and charming. During the primaries the guitar-playing former governor-cum-lay preacher Mike Huckabee won five of the 11 former confederate states, although many were held after McCain's victory was assured. At the rally in Fairfax the faithful turned out to see Sarah Palin, the straight-talking evangelical who, even though she hails from Alaska, has gone down better in the South.</p> <p>\"The South doesn't differ much from the rest of the nation on the big issues like war, tax and healthcare,\" said Guillory. \"Where it does differ is in areas of cultural conservatism - like guns, religion and abortion. In a close race that conservatism can make the difference.\"</p> <p>But Southern culture is changing. Of the 10 states with the steepest rise in Latino population, six are in the old confederacy. Meanwhile, the South's booming economy has pulled in many outsiders: particularly to the northern-most parts of Virginia and North Carolina's research triangle around the towns of Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill.</p> <p>\"People's perceptions of the South are rooted in an old idea of what the South looks like,\" said Kromm. \"But it's one of the fastest-changing regions in the country and one of the fastest-growing regions in the country.\"</p> <p>Obama hopes that if he can add some of these newcomers to his base of young, black and progressive voters he could create a serious upset. That idea is alive in Virginia, dead in Georgia and in intensive care in North Carolina. For now that is good enough for Muse. \"We never get this kind of attention. We're hanging on. It's still possible.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday September 23 2008. In the headline of the above article we originally referred to Barack Obama's move into the 'conservative deep South'. Virginia, the state mentioned in the piece, is in the South but isn't that deep. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>Financial turmoil continued to haunt Wall Street yesterday as the price of oil made a one-day record surge, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 372 points and the dollar slumped against currency markets.</p> <p>The US government's banking bailout ricocheted through the markets, prompting regulators to investigate whether speculators are manipulating prices to make a quick buck out of a financial crisis.</p> <p>On the floor of New York's Nymex commodities exchange, oil ended the day with a rise of $16.37 to $120.92 a barrel, in a surge which could prove painful for motorists at the petrol pump. At one point, the price was up by as much as $25 - about 10 times the typical daily variation.</p> <p>The jump in oil came as the US dollar slumped and Wall Street stocks suffered yet another tailspin on concern over the cost of the Bush administration's planned $700bn rescue package for teetering financial institutions. In London, the FTSE 100 index dropped 75 points to 5,236.</p> <p>The increase in the price of the industrialised world's key fuel was so large that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it was examining whether anybody was taking advantage of the \"current stresses\" facing the financial system. \"Enforcement staff will scour today's trading activity to determine whether anyone engaged in illegal manipulative activity,\" said the commission's head of enforcement, Stephen Obie. \"No one should be trying to game our nation's commodity futures markets.\"</p> <p>The controversy revived allegations raised earlier this year that speculators have been driving global oil prices higher. Such was the concern about rocketing prices that the US authorities proposed fines of $1m a day for anybody caught manipulating prices - but the issue lost momentum over the summer as prices fell from a peak of $147 to $90 a barrel.</p> <p>Over the last few weeks, global oil prices have risen again as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico damaged offshore rigs and disrupted supplies. Technical factors compounded the trend yesterday as it was the last opportunity to buy a key futures contract to take delivery of oil in October. Some market participants were scrambling to unwind \"short\" positions, which are bets that prices will fall. Stephen Schork, editor of a commodities newsletter, the Schork Report, said: \"Today was an absolute one-off. A group of traders were short in the market. This was a textbook squeeze.\"</p> <p>Experts said another reason for upward pressure was a slump in the dollar against all major currencies, caused by anxiety about the cost of the US government's $700bn bailout of struggling banks. The pound gained more than a cent to close at $1.84 and the euro jumped by 2.3 cents to $1.47. A weak dollar usually means higher oil as investors turn to commodities as a hedge.</p> <p>Congress has begun scrutinising the Bush administration's plan to rescue teetering banks by spending hundreds of billions of dollars buying up unwanted mortgage-related securities. The proposal prompted a sell-off in US investments across the board as economists digested the potential cost to the Federal Reserve.</p> <p>At the closing bell on Wall Street, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 372 points to 11,015 - a reversal of the stockmarket's enthusiasm on Friday when Treasury secretary Henry Paulson's proposals first emerged.</p> <p>With volatility at historic levels, investors have been fleeing to traditionally safe havens. The price of gold rose by 5%.</p>",

Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong have already banned or recalled a variety of milk products. Taiwan banned all mainland dairy products on Sunday. In Hong Kong Nestl\u00e9, the world's largest food company, said it had recalled a UHT pure milk product after a local food watchdog discovered samples containing a tiny amount of the chemical melamine. </p> <p>Worried Hong Kong parents also took their children for health checks, after the government announced that a three-year-old girl who had drunk a melamine-laced milk product had a kidney stone. She did not show serious symptoms and was discharged without medication or surgery.</p> <p>The Japanese government has asked 90,000 companies to check whether imports have been contaminated with melamine, and the country's Marudai Food Co has withdrawn buns made with milk supplied by one of the Chinese companies involved, Yili Industrial Group. </p> <p>In China anxious parents are queueing at hospitals to have their babies examined. The government has promised free treatment, but some families are concerned about costs and long-term complications. </p> <p>Four infants are believed to have died from the toxic formula and 104 are in serious condition, the health ministry said. It added that 1,500 had already left hospital and nearly 40,000 with milder symptoms had received clinical treatment and advice before going home. The ministry had previously reported that 6,200 children were ill, with 1,300 in hospital. It did not explain the sharp rise in numbers.</p> <p>The head of China's quality watchdog, Li Changjiang, stepped down with the approval of the cabinet, the state news agency Xinhua reported. His agency is responsible for ensuring that China's food supply chain is safe. </p> <p>Premier Wen Jiabao threatened harsh punishment for culprits as he toured hospitals in Beijing. \"Although the ordinary people are very understanding, as the government we feel very guilty,\" he said, according to Xinhua. \"This event is a warning for all food safety.\" </p> <p>The head of Sanlu, the company at the heart of the baby milk scandal, has already been arrested after being sacked. Several farmers have also been held.</p> <p>City officials in Shijiazhuang, where Sanlu is based, were also sacked, with a senior provincial official saying they knew of the problem for over a month without taking action - only telling Beijing once the Olympics were over.</p> <p>Melamine, often used to make plastics, artificially boosts apparent protein levels in tests. That creates an incentive for farmers producing substandard milk to add the substance.</p> <p>China's food quality watchdog has said it found melamine in nearly 10% of milk and drinking yoghurt samples from three dairy companies, Mengniu, Yili and the Bright group.</p> <p>To date, no illnesses have been reported from melamine in other dairy products. Tests on infant formula from other producers also found that while melamine was present in batches from a fifth of China's dairy producers, the levels were far lower than in the case of Sanlu. </p> <p>But fear has spread rapidly among consumers, and the Chinese ministry of agriculture said despairing farmers were dumping milk and killing cattle after companies stopped buying their supplies. It promised subsidies to help struggling cattle farmers.</p> <p>Starbucks in China has started serving soya milk rather than dairy with its coffee.</p> <p>The government promised to tighten its safety regime after a number of product scandals which exposed corruption, bureaucratic inertia and cost-cutting producers. </p> <p>But China's dairy producers face a crisis of confidence that will only be cured by strong action, said Lao Bing, manager of a Shanghai-based dairy investment company. </p> <p>\"Consumers will start rebuying in a month or two if they feel sure the government is undertaking a vigorous clean-up,\" he told Reuters. \"Exports will take longer. This will have a major impact.\"</p>",
  "<p>Does Moore's law now apply to human civilisation? In 1965 Gordon Moore observed that the density of transistors on integrated circuits doubles every two years or so, and predicted this would continue. Similar laws now seem to apply to every aspect of computing. And, perhaps, to the rest of the world. The information available, the scale of human interactions, the detail involved in financial deals and trading relationships and political decisions appear to be growing exponentially. We are drowning in complexity. To be good citizens we must understand what is done in our name. But how?</p> <p>We lean ever more heavily on experts. But who can we now trust? Corporate PR has become so sophisticated that it's almost impossible for most people to tell the difference between genuine science and greenwash, or real grassroots campaigns and the astroturf lobbies concocted by consultants. PR companies set up institutes with impressive names which publish what purport to be scientific papers, sometimes in the font and format of genuine journals. They accuse real scientists of every charge that could be levelled at themselves: junk science, hidden funding, undisclosed interests and inflated credentials. </p> <p>If journalists have any remaining function, it is to help people navigate this world: to try to understand the crushingly dull documents that most people don't have time for, to smoke out the fakes and show how to recognise the genuine article. But we mess up too. The most we can promise is to try not to make the same mistake twice. </p> <p>So what can you say about a man who makes the same mistake 38 times? Who, when confronted by a mountain of evidence demonstrating that his informant is a charlatan convicted under the Trade Descriptions Act, continues to repeat his claims? Who elevates the untested claims of bloggers above peer-reviewed papers? Who sticks to his path through a blizzard of facts? What should we deduce about the Sunday Telegraph's columnist Christopher Booker?</p> <p>This week Richard Wilson's book Don't Get Fooled Again is published. It contains a fascinating chapter on Booker's claims about white asbestos. Since 2002, he has published 38 articles on this topic, and every one of them is wrong. He champions the work of John Bridle, who has described himself as \"the world's foremost authority on asbestos science\". Bridle has claimed to possess an honorary professorship from the Russian Academy of Sciences, to be a consultant to an institute at the University of Glamorgan, the chief asbestos consultant for an asbestos centre in Lisbon, and a consultant to Vale of Glamorgan trading standards department. None of these claims is true. Neither the institute at the University of Glamorgan nor the centre in Lisbon have ever existed. His only relationship with the Glamorgan trading standards department is to have been successfully prosecuted by it for claiming a qualification he does not possess. </p> <p>None of this deters Mr Booker. Armed with Bridle's claims, for the past six years he has waged a campaign against asbestos science. White asbestos cement, he maintains \"poses no measurable risk to health\". He contends that \"not a single case\" of mesothelioma - the cancer caused by exposure to asbestos - \"has ever been scientifically linked with asbestos cement\". A paper commissioned by the UK's Health and Safety Executive, he says, \"concluded that the risk from white asbestos is 'virtually zero'\".</p> <p>Booker tells me he has read this paper. Oh yes? The term he quotes - \"virtually zero\" - does not appear in it. It does show that white asbestos (chrysotile) is less dangerous than brown or blue asbestos. But, while there is uncertainty about the numbers, it still presents a risk of mesothelioma, which depends on the level of exposure. People exposed to a high dose (between 10 and 100 fibres per millilitre per year (f/ml.yr)) have a risk (around two deaths per 100,000 for each f/ml.yr) of contracting this cancer. Only when the dose falls to less than 0.1 f/ml.yr does it become \"probably insignficant\". But Booker's columns contain no such caveat. He creates the impression that white asbestos is safe at all doses. The paper he misquotes also cites five scientific studies of exposure to asbestos cement, which record \"high levels of mesothelioma mortality\". </p> <p>Two years ago, John Bridle's misleading CV and dodgy record were exposed by the BBC's You and Yours programme. So the BBC immediately became part of the conspiracy: in Booker's words \"a concerted move by the powerful 'anti-asbestos lobby' to silence Bridle\". He suggested that the broadcasting regulator Ofcom would clear Bridle's name. In June this year it threw out Bridle's complaint and published evidence even more damning than that contained in the programme. So has Booker changed the way he sees \"Britain's leading practical asbestos expert\"? Far from it. He tells me that \"my view of Ofcom has plummeted\": it too has joined the conspiracy. </p> <p>We are not talking about trivia here. This is a matter of life and death. How many people might have been exposed to dangerous levels of asbestos dust as a result of reading and believing Booker's columns? </p> <p>For several years he has been waging a similar war against \"warmist alarmists\", by which he means climate scientists. Nine days ago, for instance, he attacked Michael Mann for publishing a paper that shows (alongside scores of other studies) that global temperatures do indeed follow the famous hockey-stick pattern: a moderate long-term cooling trend terminating in a sudden upward bend. Mann, Booker told his readers, had been \"selective ... in his new data, excluding anything which confirmed the Medieval Warming\". But Mann's paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses every uncluttered high-resolution proxy temperature record in the public domain. How did Booker trip up so badly? By using the claims of unqualified bloggers to refute peer-reviewed studies.</p> <p>Under their guidance he routinely mistakes weather for climate and makes claims about the temperature record that bear no relation to the studies he cites. My favourite Booker column is the piece he wrote in February, titled \"So it appears that Arctic ice isn't vanishing after all\". In September 2007, he reported, \"sea ice cover had shrunk to the lowest level ever recorded. But for some reason the warmists are less keen on the latest satellite findings, reported by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ... Its graph of northern hemisphere sea ice area, which shows the ice shrinking from 13,000 million sq km to just 4 million from the start of 2007 to October, also shows it now almost back to 13 million sq km\". To reinforce this point, he helpfully republished the graph, showing that the ice had indeed expanded between September and January. The Sunday Telegraph continues to employ a man who cannot tell the difference between summer and winter. </p> <p>But for the Wikipedia Professor of Gibberish, this patron saint of charlatans, even the seasons are negotiable. Booker remains right, whatever the evidence says. It is hard to think of any journalist - Melanie Phillips included - who has spread more misinformation. The world becomes even harder to navigate. You cannot trust the people who tell you whom to trust.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",

  "<p>It was a violent dose of nature to a coast already hammered by decades of pollution, population growth and habitat loss. As scientists and land managers start to assess the storm's impacts on beaches, dunes and marshes, they are seeing signs of present damage and future worries.</p> <p>\"The impacts are going to be phenomenal,\" said Jim Sutherlin, superintendent of the Texas parks and wildlife department's 24,250-acre J.D. Murphree Wildlife Management Area, near Port Arthur. \"We're going to take the critters that crawl or walk, and for the full stretch of the coastal zone that got the full impact of the coastal flood, they're just eliminated.\"</p> <p>Although big storms are a natural part of any coastline's life story, the upper Gulf Coast of Texas was already under stress from many sources.</p> <p>Coastal development and subsidence - a drop in the land's surface level as petroleum and groundwater are pumped out - have degraded large areas of marsh. Excessive organic material in coastal waters creates a \"dead zone\" of almost no oxygen in the upper Texas gulf.</p> <p>And today's idea of a normal Texas coast could change dramatically in a future with higher sea levels from global warming. Earlier this month, scientists from three American universities concluded in the journal Science that a global sea level rise of 31.5 inches by the year 2100 should be the assumption. The highest conceivable rise, they estimate, is 6.5 feet.</p> <p>Even the lower figure would put much of the existing Texas coastline permanently under water and would let a hurricane's strongest force reach farther inland. With coastal development, storms and rising seas all chewing away natural defences such as dunes and wetlands, damage from future hurricanes is likely to get worse.</p> <p>\"I'm sure what we'll see (from Ike) is more evidence of what happens when we don't maintain those natural barriers,\" said Larry McKinney, executive director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico studies at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi.<br>\"A hurricane is kind of a small-scale climate-change model,\" McKinney said. \"We really need to start pulling together a long-term plan for responding to climate change.\"</p> <p>The Texas coast is crucial to an astonishing range of life, from fish and amphibians to the birds that stop over during migrations along the great Central Flyway from South American winter habitats to arctic nesting grounds. What happens to the dunes, estuaries and marshes along the upper Gulf Coast can be felt across the entire hemisphere for years.</p> <p>Under natural conditions, coastal ecosystems adapt to the effects of hurricanes and even use them to flush out marshes and estuaries, changing water chemistry and plant communities.</p> <p>Storms can restart the cycles of succession, or the natural rhythm of birth, maturity, death and rebirth in an ecosystem.</p> <p>Coastal habitats also absorb storms' energy, a lesson made real in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina rushed ashore unimpeded by the former marsh that once protected New Orleans. The long, narrow strips of sand that parallel the Texas coast and the marshes behind them attempt the same role; they aren't called barrier islands for nothing.</p> <p>Ike's storm surge threatened to take out in a few hours the dune build-up of years, and to drown under seawater the marshes that survive on a mixture of fresh water and saltwater. The death of more marshes and the loss of the natural protection they provide is a certainty, experts said.</p> <p>\"These marshes were not in a healthy, dynamic state to start with because of human impacts,\" said Sutherlin, the wildlife area superintendent. Hundreds of acres, perhaps thousands, will be lost, he added.</p> <p>\"Everything's still under water,\" Sutherlin said. \"It looks like an ocean out there.\"</p> <p>The hurricane's effect on the complex natural system of the Texas coast will be apparent when scientists measure water quality in the gulf. The northernmost reaches of the Texas shoreline frequently becomes a \"dead zone\" with extremely low oxygen levels, but a hurricane quickly restores the oxygen, said Steve DiMarco of Texas A&amp;M's department of oceanography.</p> <p>Unlike the more widely publicised dead zone at the mouth of the Mississippi river, which is attributed to excessive nitrates from farming and other upriver sources, the Texas dead zone is linked to organic material of uncertain origin stirred up from coastal marshes. Sea level rise will complicate the problem.</p> <p>\"Over the long run, as the seawater flushes in, more organic material will get out,\" DiMarco said. But as to whether that will mean a bigger dead zone, \"I won't go that far.\"</p> <p>Steps for reducing hurricane threats range from restoring marshes to keeping people away from vulnerable areas. However, with each successive storm, each census showing coastal population increasing, and each new, higher projection of sea-level rise, Texas coastal experts fear that they have fewer choices.</p> <p>\"We have some options, but they're running out,\" said McKinney of the Harte Institute. \"We need to take advantage of this disaster to learn.\"</p>",

US agents arrested Emmanuel in March 2006, as he tried to sneak back into the country at Miami International airport.</p> <p>According to a federal indictment, Emmanuel's job from 1999 to 2002 was to intimidate, weaken and eliminate his father's political opponents.</p> <p>Prosecutors will tell jurors that Emmanuel ran a prison camp in Gbatala, Liberia, where the Demon Forces kept prisoners in pits covered with iron bars and barbed wire. Guards jabbed at the prisoners through the bars with sharp metal rods and on at least one occasion shovelled stinging ants into a pit, prosecutors allege.</p> <p>In April 1999, Emmanuel summarily executed three men and ordered guards to cut another prisoner's throat, the indictment states.</p> <p>Human rights groups praise the prosecution as an important step toward holding an alleged torturer accountable.</p> <p>However, the case has also stirred debate over controversial interrogation practices approved by US officials in the war on terror, said Theresa Harris, a lawyer with the World Organisation for Human Rights USA, based in Washington.</p> <p>\"It's important that the United States is bringing forward this prosecution, but it also raises an obvious question,\" Harris said. \"Are we only going to consider it a criminal act if another country's officials conduct torture, or are we going to hold our own officials accountable?\"</p> <p>Prosecutors and defence lawyers are already sparring over how to define torture for the jury.</p> <p>Prosecutors argue an act could be considered torture if it causes pain that is \"extreme in intensity and difficult to endure\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, Emmanuel's attorneys say the law requires a higher level of pain - that ordinarily is associated with death, organ failure or serious impairment of body functions.</p>",

  "<p>Britain is a nation of museums, where they have collected everything worth collecting. A good museum typically requires generations of hard work. With long and careful planning the British have plundered collectibles from Egypt, India and Mexico, from China, and all corners of the world, carting valuables home like tireless ants. They spent no small amount of taxpayers\u2019 money doing this, and they have spent even more on preservation.</p> <p>They were spending pounds sterling, and everyone knows how far the pound goes.</p> <p>Of course, their first priority was collecting all the valuables of their own nation - that\u2019s the way it always is. Their best-preserved item is the British royal family, ie the Queen. This family is ancient, and by now a little eccentric; like all the world\u2019s most celebrated families, its descendants want nothing so much as to up and vanish like drops of water returning to the sea. Unfortunately for them they were born in Britain, where this human right is denied to them. The British nation spends vast sums every year maintaining the royal family in luxury, so that they can be revered by the British people and tourists from around the world. The money probably isn\u2019t as important as the feeling: maintaining the royal family\u2019s identity as the centre of Britain, even of the entire world. It\u2019s a hopeless task, and it\u2019s hard to imagine another country devoting so much effort to such an absurd business.<br>Some people believe the British royal family arranged for the death of Princess Diana. I don\u2019t think so: there wasn\u2019t any need for Buckingham Palace to do it, nor do I think they had the resources. But Princess Diana\u2019s behaviour was ruining the most precious item ever to grace Britain\u2019s collection, and I imagine this was a great distress to those keen on this particular item. That much is for sure.</p> <p>We Chinese know all about the distress collecting can bring. In 1860, more than 3,000 British gentlemen broke into China\u2019s Yuanmingyuan and carted off countless unmatched treasures before putting it to the torch. In 1900 they returned, once again carting off countless treasures, and once again putting it to the torch. Many Chinese cultural heritage experts, returning from visits to British museums, say that the British have impeccable taste when it comes to collecting - they only took the good stuff. Many Chinese can\u2019t understand why the British had to burn things down when they were finished looting, it seems entirely gratuitous. To be honest, it may be a good thing that those artifacts are all being kept in Britain, as they\u2019ll be better preserved there. But why start the fires? For this the Chinese have never forgiven the British.</p> <p>In order to gain a little favour with the Chinese, the British government returned Hong Kong to China, lock, stock and barrel. Old man Patten, who had just been relieved of the governorship of Hong Kong, and Prince Charles, who had just been divorced, secretly departed Hong Kong in a small fishing boat in the middle of the night on June 30, 1997. Yet still the Chinese are unhappy: why did you have to burn it down?</p> <p>There\u2019s only one reasonable explanation for this; it also has to do with collecting. Yuanmingyuan and the Summer Palace were not merely the residences of the Empress Dowager Cixi and the emperor, they were chiefly museums - at that time some of the biggest museums in the Far East, even the world. They were unique and unrivalled, both in terms of their collections and the design of the displays. This was an affront to the far-ranging British, who could not accept that the world held better museums than theirs, or more avid collectors than they. So they burnt Yuanmingyuan to ensure their pre-eminence in the world of collecting.</p> <p>But even the British collectors have lapses in judgment, and they left behind something that should not have been forgotten, something truly unique: the last emperor of China, Aisin Gioro Puyi. As the last ruler of China\u2019s feudal dynasties, his line had stretched over 400 years, but he came to a very bitter end, all because the British neglected to add him to their collection. After being driven out of the Forbidden City he passed some unhappy time in Tianjin and north-eastern China before the Soviets grabbed him. Of course he was part of the Japanese collection for part of that time, but he was never satisfied with the price the Japanese had paid for him. In 1949 he was sent back to China, and underwent 10 years of Communist education at the Fushun War Crimes Re-education Centre. By the time he was granted pardon in 1959 Puyi was already 52 years old. He was introduced to an old maid, Li Shuxian, and the two were married. By this time the Party and government realised the importance of preserving the line of the dragon - which is to say they understood the importance of collecting - and they wished that the last emperor might produce an heir. Prime minister Zhou Enlai personally made inquiries into the matter but, sadly, Puyi was already impotent. New China\u2019s medical resources were terribly behind the times, and all they could think to do was give him hormone shots. After receiving the shots the emperor would go bounding home, but still it came to nothing - the more shots they gave him, the worse off he became. So the long line of Chinese emperors came to an end. If this had been Britain, I\u2019m sure they could have thought of something.</p> <p>While we\u2019re on the subject, Puyi himself was also something of a collector. He was a collector of a very particular sort. He, along with his brother Aisin Gioro Pujie, brazenly looted the collection of his forefathers from the Forbidden City. The exact numbers are hard to estimate, but the items included gifts from the British royal family to the Qing emperors. He lived by selling off these treasures, and when the time came to flee he threw away what he couldn\u2019t carry. He caused the ruin of very many items. Later he donated a great number to Stalin in the name of \u201csupporting the development of the Soviet economy\u201d; actually he was buying his own life. By the time he found himself in Fushun he still had three great leather chests full of treasures; of course every one of these was handed over to the nation. The government, mindful of his remaining days, allowed him to retain a single item for his personal use. Puyi chose nothing rare or priceless for himself, only a cheap gold-plated watch from France. It wasn\u2019t even a part of the Forbidden City collection, it was something he\u2019d bought from Ullmann &amp; Co in 1924, as he fled through Beijing from the Prince Chun Mansion to the Japanese embassy. Clearly he had lost interest in being a collector - perhaps he had already come to realise the dangers of the pursuit.</p> <p>A good collector would sell his soul to add to his collection; Puyi only thought to sell his collection in order to preserve his own skin.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise - the Chinese are actually no great collectors. They mostly love new things, the newer the better. In households throughout the countryside, the labour of a whole generation may be spent in tearing down an old home and replacing it with a new tile-roofed house. If a family is still living in the house of their ancestors it\u2019s a great loss of face. I\u2019ve heard that plenty of regular people in England are living in three- or four-hundred-year-old houses - good lord, they\u2019re practically living in the Forbidden City! The Chinese would never live in buildings like that - according to tradition, old buildings are haunted.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Chinese don\u2019t have the means for collection. We\u2019re a developing country- it may look like we\u2019ve got plenty of space and resources, but divide it all by a population of 1.3 billion and we\u2019ve barely got enough pairs of pants to go around. Everyone knows that China collects giant pandas, but this collection alone is a major strain on the national finances. To be honest, we can\u2019t actually afford the furry things. So the government encourages private citizens to adopt them - a friend of mine with plenty of money did it. He spent more than 200,000 yuan a year, but he couldn\u2019t even take the panda home, he was only permitted to have a commemorative photograph taken with it. This struck him as a bad deal, and he gave it up after the first year. To resolve the financial burden of their panda collection the Chinese came up with another idea - giving them away as gifts. The first chance they get, Chinese leaders will bestow a panda on other nations, particularly developed nations. The recipients are all tremendously grateful, because they know pandas are the national treasure of China. But in truth they\u2019ve been duped: they are obliged to put huge amounts of labour and resources into researching pandas and all their various needs. The Americans were the first to fall for it. Two years ago Mainland China tried to gift Taiwan with two cute pandas, \u201cTuantuan\u201d and \u201cYuanyuan\u201d, but the Taiwanese (who are also Chinese) were far too sharp, and saw right through the trick - they declined the gift.</p> <p>The British truly understand collecting, and they\u2019ve got the means to do it. They even collect human beings. They say that if you buy a cup of coffee and sit on the corner of Oxford Street, you can see people from more than 140 different countries. They\u2019ve got all colours, all faiths. The British government has to adjust its immigration policies every year in order to preserve the proper balance of races.</p> <p>Of course they also collect political dissidents. Any open, civilised society must maintain a certain quantity of political dissidents. The Dalai Lama has been part of the collection for many years, but it\u2019s time now to bring him out and put him on the auction block. In the past I\u2019ve also thought about trying to get on the list, and enjoy the status of being a collector\u2019s item. But really, being a political dissident is just too easy these days. A little criticism of current affairs, a little cursing of the government - to me it\u2019s both thrilling, and also perfectly safe. To be honest I\u2019d love to curse the Communist Party, but it\u2019s a bit late for that now. The Party has already wised up; they\u2019ve realised that allowing people to curse them without reprisal is a great display of their high-mindedness. The more you curse, the more enlightened they look. Christ, you might as well just start praising them. In the next 50 years, the prospects for political dissidence in China look very dim indeed. No one will bother collecting us, not even the oldest and grandest of the imperialist nations - Great Britain. When the British government decides it\u2019s time to do business with China, no one will give us a second thought.</p> <p>In the spring of 2008 I received an unexpected invitation to visit Britain. More than a decade ago I wrote a book called I Love Dollars. It was banned in China at the time, and was fairly well-known. If it hadn\u2019t been banned, I doubt whether it would have been quite so well-known. It\u2019s the story of a son who helps his father go through the streets looking for women - highly challenging to the traditional morality of the Chinese people. To be honest this book caused me a lot of problems because it was narrated in the first person, and critics and readers assumed it was autobiographical; my father and I both lost our reputations. Just when I was finally forgetting the whole thing, the English version of I Love Dollars was published in America and became quite popular, even garnering a nomination for an international literary prize. A British cultural organisation got my phone number from the British embassy in China, and asked me if I could write a book called I Love Pounds. If I was interested, they would pay my way for a trip to England.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t respond right away, first because of my unpleasant memories of I Love Dollars, second because I\u2019ve never taken writing lightly. The next day I went to the Beijing branch of the Bank of China to check that day\u2019s exchange rates, and saw that the British pound sterling was worth almost two American dollars! Who wouldn\u2019t love pounds? But even so I made no rash decisions - I only exchanged a few notes to take home with me. I exchanged a total of 85 pounds, one each of the 50, 20, 10 and five-pound denominations. Back home I laid these notes on my desk and stared for a long time at the image of the Queen. I asked myself if I were capable of any true feelings for this particular currency. One week later I had still experienced no emotion. I prepared my answer to the British: I\u2019m very sorry, I won\u2019t be able to write I Love Pounds, maybe you could try Ha Jin. The name of this Chinese writer, winner of the National Book Award in America, could be translated as \u201cLikes Money\u201d.</p> <p>I had picked up the phone and dialled a long string of numbers, and was waiting for the call to go through, when I suddenly noticed the 50-pound note, and a small line to the upper left of the Queen\u2019s head: I PROMISE TO PAY THE BEARER ON DEMAND THE SUM OF... I had the ghostly sensation that the Queen herself was speaking to me, in tones which, though lacking intimacy, removed all possibility of doubt. In that instant, I found my inspiration.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working steadily on I Love Pounds since my return from England, and if this book is successful it may even result in my being collected - who can say?
