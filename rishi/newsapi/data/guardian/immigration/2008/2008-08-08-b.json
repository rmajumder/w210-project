  "<p>Russell's explosively imaginative stories explore an adolescent hinterland, gradually unfurling to encompass a more ominous and unaccommodating world. Full of a lively sense of the fantastical, the stories also inhabit a beautifully realised natural environment of starlit skies, phosphorescent caves and abundant animal life. Performance is a dominant theme, from ice-skating apes to the alligators which captivate tourists in the theme park \"Swamplandia!\". These displays mirror the brave face put on by so many of Russell's characters, such as the group of girls raised by wolves who embark on a painful process of re-civilisation at the hands of nuns, hiding their frailties and trying to operate as best they can within socially accepted norms. Meanwhile, feelings of alienation accompany awkwardly expanding bodies and uneasy relationships with often absent parents. As she explores the existential angst of her characters, Russell's injection of a sense of the absurd lends an originality and lightness of touch to this creatively acrobatic debut.</p>",
  "<p>Some of Ireland's wisest literary commentators have been troubled in recent times by a reticence they perceive among the country's writers of fiction on the matter of the new prosperity. The novelists have told us nothing - thus runs the argument. An Irish Amis has proved reluctant to appear. </p> <p>Like most debating stances, it obscures as much as it reveals, but its assumptions are more enlightening than its conclusions. Mass-market fiction, the historical novel, the thriller, the crime novel and other incarnations of genre-based storytelling have not been judged worthy of critical notice, no matter their level of engagement with the now deceased Celtic Tiger. Where is our Bret Easton Ellis? Our Bonfire of the Vanities? </p> <p>You sometimes get the feeling the vestals of the flame may have been looking in all the wrong places. For Anne Enright's Taking Pictures , Colm Toibin's Mothers and Sons , Roddy Doyle's The Deportees , Claire Keegan's Walk the Blue Fields and Philip O'Ceallaigh's Notes from a Turkish Whorehouse have each implicitly claimed a power for the literary short story to speak of its com plex times. Now comes an outstanding debut collection from Irish emigre Gerard Donovan. It might persuade those who have been waiting for the epic of affluent Ireland that size isn't everything after all. </p> <p>Toibin wrote some years ago, in a witty allusion to Joyce's \"The Dead\", that \"snow was general over Irish fiction\". Anyone who grew up reading Irish short stories would smile bleakly with recognition at the metaphor. There was lyricism in the writing, but it sometimes blanketed the actual landscape you suspected might be lying beneath. Donovan, the latest accomplished Irish novelist to enter the snowstorm - his novel Julius Winsome is an extraordinary achievement - has no truck whatsoever with strategies of concealment. His stories are meltingly beautiful. </p> <p>This is an Ireland of traffic, of suburbs and over-pricing, of \"pink and blue neon signs, huge hotels standing alone till more business built up around them, and then the rabbit-cage houses\". Rural idylls are unavailable, the stuff of daytime television. \"It was getting on in the day and after work. Dinners were ready, lights flooding rooms. The afternoon dramas like Emmerdale Farm were at an end, and soon it would be time for the news.\" Interestingly, the city exerting its magnetism on the characters is usually Galway, not Dublin, and subtly subverted images of the Irish west abound. \"Play some national songs,\" says one character. \"Let's hear some patriot songs.\" This plea has been caused by a sentence Yeats and Synge could never in their wildest nightmares have imag ined: \"I declare, my father said holding the guitar, I love Waylon Jennings.\" </p> <p>The writing crackles with truthfulness, a piercing acuity. A troubled husband wonders \"what kept any couple together, what preserved a marriage from the people in it?\" A surly construction foreman \"wore impatience in the guise of curiosity\". The winter sun is \"a pale yellow circle pressed like a fingertip against the ice on the bedroom window\". A man urinates \"to such relief that he could have written about it\". In the wrenchingly poignant title story, set at a charity fundraising race, a businessman's ill-considered sprint becomes an understated but continuously deepening metaphor, not only for his life but for the fervency of a society that tried running before it had learned to walk. </p> <p>The literal presence of the ancient past is approached with immense skill in \"Archaeologists\" (one of several pieces in which images of archaeology figure), a troublingly prescient story set in an Ireland whose real-life politicians wish to run a motorway through the ancient valley of Tara. Indeed, cars are the setting for many important scenes in this exquisite collection, imaging the paralysis and social separation of their gridlocked occupants as touchingly as Joyce's boarding-house rooms once did. </p> <p>In \"By Irish Nights\" - for this reader the only unsuccessful story - cars almost acquire the status of characters: \"In the houses they pass, some are not yet dreaming . . . Across the country, from Donegal to Tipperary and down to Kerry, the roads have begun to fill, coast roads, roads through small towns, roads widening into the mid lands, narrowing into cities.\" Parallels with Joyce's \"After the Race\", an earlier Irish story about cars, seem to suggest themselves before disappearing like tail-lights in fog. \"The Summer of Birds\" is a heartbreaking story, as perfect as a William Trevor miniature. </p> <p>Much more than a book about the Celtic Tiger (although it is certainly that), this is a collection about the anxieties and sublimated fears of the Ireland that rejected the Lisbon treaty in June, despite being commanded not to do so by its establishment. There's a sense of having come too far, of something precious being lost, doing battle with a simultaneous and equally adamant mistrust of the past. Is Ireland European? A kind of America? Or both? What did the good years mean? Images of maps and cartography occur frequently in Donovan's writing. It's hard to avoid thinking we've pulled up at a crossroads, the place where rural Ireland's young people used to court and dance, but where the bluesmen of another storytelling tradition sold their compromised souls to the devil. </p> <p>This is not the first fiction about Ireland's economic boom but it may well be the first to see it for what it truly was, in all its shimmering newness and garish strangeness - its ugliness somehow related to its beauty. That Gerard Donovan manages to unearth such resonant grace from that paradox is remarkable. This is an important and haunting collection. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Joseph O'Connor's novel Redemption Falls is published by Vintage.</p>",

Donkeys are very gentle, lovable creatures. Like Dr Sansom, in fact.</p> <p>The smallest donkeys in the world are miniature Mediterranean donkeys. These tiny donkeys are usually less than a metre in height. You can't ride a miniature donkey though, obviously.</p> <h2>The worst summer</h2> <p>It all depends, of course, on what you mean by \"worst\". The worst summer of all would be a summer where you had to go to school all summer. But let's take \"worst\" to mean the worst weather. In which case, one of the worst summers in the UK was in 1956. It rained, a lot.</p> <p>And one of the coldest summers in the UK was in 1922, when the average temperature was 12.3 degrees.

  "<p>Hundreds, possibly thousands, of volunteer fighters from Russia were mobilising to enter the war in Georgia's breakaway republic of South Ossetia last night.</p> <p>Units of armed Cossacks from across the North Caucasus region which borders Georgia were poised to join the battle for the separatists' capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>In North Ossetia, the region of Russia which shares cultural links and a border with South Ossetia, lists of men willing to fight against Georgian forces were drawn up. Vitaly Khubayev, 35, from the capital, Vladikavkaz, told the Guardian: \"There are already two busloads of fighters leaving for Tskhinvali every day. They give you a uniform on the way and you get issued with weapons once you arrive. If I didn't have three children I'd have gone.\"</p> <p>The two Ossetias are historically inseparable and residents of the northern republic were furious yesterday at what they described as the \"Georgian fascist attack\" on their neighbours.</p> <p>Many said they were willing to take up arms and travel to defend their relatives across the border in South Ossetia. Valentin Tekhti, 67, a teacher, said: \"Our Ossetian brothers are dying. If we get the call, every man who can stand on two legs will go to fight.\" </p> <p>Amiran Khubetsov, a doctor, said: \"A nation is under bombardment in the land it has occupied for hundreds of years. The world must not ignore this aggression.\"</p> <p>At a special meeting of the UN security council yesterday morning, the United States called on the Kremlin to prevent irregulars entering South Ossetia via the 4km Roki tunnel, the republic's only link with Russia. But at a meeting with the US president, George Bush, in Bejing, the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, admitted \"many volunteers\" were heading to South Ossetia and it would be \"very hard to maintain peace\".</p> <p>Under Russia law, Cossacks - the descendants of runaway serfs and outlaws who in the past were employed to protect the country's southern border - are allowed to carry arms and carry out policing functions in cooperation with interior ministry forces.</p> <p>At the headquarters of the Terek Cossacks in Vladikavkaz yesterday a group of men sat under portraits of fierce looking warriors with drooping moustaches watching television coverage of Georgian artillery shelling Tskhinvali. One man said there would be a meeting today to discuss forming volunteer units. </p> <p>In Volgograd the leader of the Don Cossacks, Viktor Vodolatsky, called on all Cossacks under 40 to volunteer. Reports said 100 men from the region had already left for Tskhinvali. \"We must help our South Ossetian brothers,\" he said.</p> <p>Irregular troops from the north Caucasus played an important role in the conflicts that saw both Georgia's breakaway regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, secede in the early 1990s.</p> <p>In Abkhazia, Cossack and Chechen units fought side by side against Georgian troops, despite being historical enemies. Abkhazia has promised to help South Ossetia in its conflict with Georgia.</p> <p>Ossetians in Vladikavkaz yesterday said they were hoping for a decisive strike by the Russian army to drive Georgia's forces out of South Ossetia. There were emotional scenes in the city, as hundreds of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the regional government headquarters and shouted, \"Russia, save us!\"</p> <p>Aelita Dzhioyeva, 41, a lawyer who fled Tskhinvali on Thursday evening, showed text messages on her mobile phone from relatives still sheltering in a basement in the city. One message read: \"We are dying. Ask the government for help.\"</p> <p>Dzhioyeva said: \"Our men will stay and fight until the last drop of blood, but our old people and children must be saved. We are calling on the Kremlin to intervene and create a humanitarian corridor for them to escape.\"</p> <p>Shota Kochiev, 60, said: \"This is America's doing. They are supporting Georgia's mad lust for new land - our land.\"</p> <p>About 2,000 refugees from South Ossetia, mostly women and children, have so far been bussed to Russia and are staying in hotels around Vladikavkaz.</p>",
  "<h2>Why is the price of oil falling?</h2> <p>Motorists could be forgiven for being confused. Oil prices reached a record $147 a barrel at the start of last month, amid speculation that they were on course to breach $200 a barrel over the next few months. But after a sharp fall over recent weeks, which has shaved $25 off the cost of a barrel of crude, there is talk of oil prices tumbling below $100.</p> <p>A number of factors have been at play. First, there is growing concern over the state of the global economy. The US is either in recession or close to it; so are Britain and the Eurozone. Even the fast-growing economies of the developing world -China and India - have come off the boil as the effects of the year-long credit crunch have rippled around the world. The price of oil, like that for any commodity, is affected by demand for it, and projected demand has fallen as growth prospects for 2009 have been pared back. There have also been signs of a pick-up in supply from Opec, the production cartel, in response to the surge in oil prices. Lower demand plus higher supply equals lower prices.</p> <p>Second, there has been the ebbing away of some of the geopolitical and weather-related factors that have been underpinning oil prices, such as fears of a nuclear stand-off between the US and Iran, supply disruption in Nigeria, and a devastating hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Third, financial developments have been helpful. Oil is priced in US dollars and there tends to be an inverse relationship between oil prices and the greenback; when the dollar goes down, oil prices go up as suppliers seek to ensure they get the same amount of money for their crude once the proceeds are converted into their own currencies. The opposite happens when the dollar strengthens, and in recent weeks it has risen against the euro as fears have grown over the state of the EU economy.</p> <p>Last, oil is no longer flavour of the month for hedge funds. Speculation drove prices up, but now that the economic backdrop has darkened, speculation is helping to drive them down.<br><strong>Larry Elliott</strong></p> <h2>What is Nice?</h2> <p>Nice is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, established in 1999 in order to end the \"NHS postcode lottery\", which had meant that patients in some areas got access to expensive medicines, paid for by the taxpayer, while equally deserving patients in other areas didn't. </p> <p>For obvious reasons, there would be no point in the NHS funding treatments that didn't work, however little they cost, so Nice conducts clinical appraisals of drugs and other treatments to find out if they are cost effective. A cheap drug that works well would get an automatic all clear because it would provide good value for taxpayers' money.</p> <p>The difficulty comes when Nice finds a drug that is effective, but expensive - which happened this week when Professor Peter Littlejohns, the institute's clinical director, gave a preliminary decision (still subject to appeal) to reject state funding for Sutent and three other drugs that delay the progression of advanced kidney cancer by several months. </p> <p>Littlejohns did not dispute that hundreds of patients could benefit if the NHS funded these drugs, but his decision was based on the fact that they cost \u00a320,000 to \u00a335,000 a patient. </p> <p>Nice uses a yardstick called Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) - how much it would cost to secure an extra year of healthy life by providing a new medicine - to measure whether a drug gives value for money. All four cancer drugs failed the test. However much the patients affected might appreciate a few months of respite, the cost in QALYs was six times too high.</p> <p>Whenever the institute decides against a drug, it is bombarded with criticism from doctors, patients and the pharmaceutical companies that had hoped to profit from the NHS. It seems Nice has a distinctly nasty job.<br><strong>John Carvel</strong></p> <h2>Why was Frankie Gavin sent home?</h2> <p>Frankie Gavin isn't the first boxer to fail to make the weight so close to his dream date. But unlike your everyday pugilist, what Gavin has lost can't be replicated later in a London ring. As the Beijing games kicked off with a spectacular opening ceremony yesterday, Gavin was back home, 3lb (1.4kg) over the 60kg lightweight limit that would have allowed him entry into the Olympic ring.</p> <p>Eight years ago, in Sydney, heavyweight Audley Harrison won gold for Britain; in Athens in 2004, Amir Khan won silver in the lightweight division. At their respective games, they were the only British boxers, and excitement at their achievement led to an increase in investment. </p> <p>Since January 2007, the eight fighters in the British team have received \u00a375,000 each year from UK Sport, the distributor of national lottery funds, to help them win medals. The money covers everything from travel to nutritionists, which makes it all the more worrying that he is not still in Beijing.</p> <p>Three pounds is not that much weight. Had he worn the official team uniform and marched around the Bird's Nest Stadium during last night's opening ceremony, he might have lost that 3lbs, such was the heat and humidity. </p> <p>But therein lies the problem. Gavin had tried to lose weight, but his body could not lose anymore. The scheduling was against him too - between bouts at last November's World Amateur Championships, he skipped, hit the pads and ran to lose weight. He would not have been able to do that in Beijing as there wasn't enough time between bouts.</p> <p>People will point fingers, ask if someone was to blame, but perhaps it was just nature, playing a knockout blow. <br><strong>Michael Phillips</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday August 12 2008. In the section 'Why was Frankie Gavin sent home?', we said the reason was his failure, by 3kg (1.4lb), to make the required weight for his competition. This conversion was the wrong way round. He failed, as the same piece said later, by 3lb, which is approximately 1.4kg. One kilogram is equivalent to 2.205 pounds. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to be thought of a hard man, you've got two ways in. First, you can perform public acts of violence. If this comes naturally to you, then you're already there. To the rest of us, getting punched in the tum-tum and being forced to say \"oof\" is too much of a risk. The second, less antisocial, way is to hold down a job where you run the daily risk of injury and dismemberment. If you're in this group - maybe you're a bouncer, a soldier, or you might chase storms for a living - then your mates will probably be appearing in a documentary this year.</p> <p>Our TV screens are bursting with cross-looking, firm gentlemen in shows that make you feel pathetic for not being routinely maimed. Shows that show you exactly what a fraction of a man you are, all swaddled up on the sofa bed with your nan bringing you toast with the crusts cut off. Why aren't you a lumberjack, eh? Why didn't you dig the Channel Tunnel? Hands up who's had their nuts crushed by a deaf guy. Thought not - but in ITV's Bouncers show, Bungy the Bouncer didn't even blink. He just put his knee on the guy's head and mouthed the words for him. </p> <p>Hard men have been on the telly for decades: Terry McCann, was the noble bodyguard to Arthur Daley's ferrety antics; Bodie and Doyle were solid buggers, even if untrained in the nuances of treating ladies right; Auf Wiedersehen Pet had Bomber, the docile giant who'd appear behind you in a bar brawl as you raised a bottle, and blithely hoist your arm from its socket.</p> <p>But those were drama shows: all actors, punchless cuddle-fights and plot. If there are two things genuinely hard men have no time for, it's doilies and frilly-knickered bullshit like \"character arcs\". If they're going to be on TV, documentaries are their natural home, a place where guileless masculinity can express itself with no need for personal development or plot progression. Leave that to the stool-arsed Jacks in the editing booth, yeah?</p> <p>The first salvo of shows were the floodgate openers in the UK: ITV's Bouncers, Ross Kemp In Afghanistan, all shows with the advantage of recognisably hard men. Soldiers, doormen, dangerous gang members, all concealing their fear and acting like weapons. These shows had the unique opportunity to show the softer, more thoughtful sides of the men in question. Everyone came out of them looking good, most of all Kemp.</p> <p>Then the American shows arrived, with Duane Chapman. Nicknamed Dog thanks to his resemblance to an punched-in Afghan Hound, his was the fantasy world of Hawaiian Bounty Hunter - Boba Fett in a floral print. His tough-guy credentials all checked out - armed robbery, murder, 18 months in jail, infuriating the Mexican government - but there was something about Dog that left him lacking. It's his hairstyle, to be honest: he could spray you with mace and snap your joints, but you'd still feel like you'd won the fight because he'd walk away looking like that.</p> <p>Besides, mace is cheating. In the new batch of real-job shows, there are no bounty hunters or space pirates, and they only use tools that could turn lethally on them at any moment. Massive, indifferent steel claws controlled by a man who laughs when the camera's on him. In Discovery Channel's The Deadliest Catch, we're coaxed into the world of extreme fishing with scenes from Alaska's most dangerous crab-fishing season. The crew are flipped around like manburgers, by the ocean's motiveless aggression. Even if you think that's just what fishermen do, think about the cameramen. They'd much rather be filming Steve-O punch his dad in the face.</p> <p>Ax Men, shown on The History Channel on the basis that \"men have been chopping down trees for ages\", is less instantly convincing. A tree isn't a terrifying thing, unless it's coming up some stairs and firing acorns at your shins. So they don't waste any time showing you a man whose hands have been replaced with metal claws. Sixteen seconds in, and there's a man flexing his mechanical hand, laughing. Your brain makes the connections: the life of an ax man is half Donkey Kong, half Batman villain. This is going to be awesome.</p> <p>Only Ice Road Truckers fails. Covering the lives of a few Canadian truckers who drive across roads made of ice, it's central promise is \"this road could eat you, any minute, grrrr\". But that never really happens, apart from in fairly weak CG reconstructions. So they're left with a soap opera, in which a man cries when his oil pan cracks, and everyone picks on the guy who decided to stop working the big rigs because he didn't want to die. Honestly, what a bunch of bitches.</p> <p>It's not just strength. It's about family: the prematurely ageing wife with an insurance policy; a kid who'll join you in the job because you never let on about the opportunities in data input. But mostly, the ties to the group of men whose skills you depend on to survive. Because men are the manliest kind of family you can have. At the end of Speed, there's a line where Sandra Bullock says, \"Relationships based on intense experiences never work.\" What Keanu should have said back was, \"Well, that's only true if you let the intense experiences stop. Let's be space pirates!\"</p> <p>They leave you smacking your lips, hungry for action. It's all about staying close enough to death to feel alive, and reacting to a shattered femur with a cheerful quip.</p> <p>But let's not get carried away: remember the way those Ice Road Truckers turned into Cissie Braithwaite and Ada Shufflebotham the second things went wrong? Think of Dog the Bounty Hunter's hair. And most of all, remember it's all commissioned and stitched together by crafty pampered types who know how to play us like tiny violins.

  "<p>I was asked recently why I called a particular character \"Rowan\" - was it for the tree? The woman who asked the question is into what you might call spiritual botany - which I am not - and somehow, this meant I had to give her a practical answer, because although creativity can be a mysterious force, it is also an ordinary business of putting things together and hoping they will stick. </p> <p>The Rowan in question is a small boy who appears at the end of my last novel, The Gathering. He has, or I hope he has, a kind of iconic or uncanny quality. So I said that, yes, I took the name from the tree and yes, I am aware it was considered a magical tree, and a protective one in the Celtic tradition, and that this mattered a little, though not as much as the simple fact that the tree is native to Ireland. As a name, Rowan has modern, slightly hippyish overtones; it is sometimes chosen over the Gaelic \"Rohan\", and both these facts suited my purposes very well. </p> <p>Checking my notes, I found that the little trees in the asylum graveyard that features in the book were rowans, and this synchronicity was very satisfying to me. Finally, I have met a couple of Rowans, both children, and they are both pretty fab. So yes, he was named for the tree. Sort of. But there was no magic to the naming - or not the kind of magic that my questioner was into. I chose this name for reasons poetical, tribal, sociological, personal and arbitrary. I chose this name because he is a beautiful little boy whose extended family look at him as though they had never seen a child before.</p> <p>\"Rowan,\" they say. \"Rowan?\" </p> <p>Naming is nice. It took me days before I was able to speak a name for my first child (what if people did not like it?), and I suspect we gave her a secret, second name as well, to keep her safe. Of course, we did no such thing. We just put a word on this new human creature and used it freely and easily, the way you do. We told it to the government. We bandied it about. By the time the second child was named, we had steeled ourselves into a state of insouciance. </p> <p>Naming characters is much less fraught - you know a lot more about your characters than you do about your babies, for a start. I use a dictionary of names that I bought many years ago, trying not to look pregnant at the till. I also have a dictionary of Irish surnames, to check the provenance and the meaning of a particular family name. I use the phone book, and I ask people, all the time, where their name comes from, which in some societies, particularly multicultural ones, is considered rude. I hope I am not rude, but I do want to know their story - surnames can tell you about wealth or class, but more usually they speak of movements and migrations, both ancient and modern. </p> <p>In more static societies, like Ireland, you can tell where a person is from by their surname, or where their grandparents are from. So provincial, I know; so ugly, when you use it to guess their religion (but I like doing that, too). The information a name contains is both private and general. It intimates much, but it doesn't mean a goddamn thing - as any Catholic called Billy will be quite happy to tell you. </p> <p>If surnames yield history, first names give us love stories: they speak of the family mythology, the kind of person your parents hoped you might become. It is important to keep this element of hope when you name a character. It is important to keep your creation open, though it is a brave writer who leaves them entirely blank (by calling his protagonist John, for example, or even \"K\"). A funky name can add various things to a character. I might ramp one up for poetic resonance, another writer will do it for satirical effect. All of which has to be done with care. </p> <p>Though John means nothing and Paul means very little, John Paul will be a Catholic (religion again) born in the early 1980s; he will also possibly be working class. The more socially legible the name, the more satirical the book (or proud, sometimes), and the less the name is of use to me. Contempt or pride are not emotions I have about the people I create. That is not what I create them for. I create them to see what they will do.</p> <p>So. </p> <p>There he is. I can see him - if I stay still long enough. What I have first is a glimpse; a flicker of emotion. I know what this child does to the people around him. I spend some time trying to decide on a name, and meanwhile, by sleight, I steal some details; the colour of his hair and - goodness yes - his blue eyes. There he is. The child has turned around. What he wears is up to me, I dress him myself. No, not lace-up shoes - cute but too impractical - he wears sneakers with lycra fastenings. He keeps changing size, though - like ET in the movie - the proportions shift, depending on where, and how important, he is in the scene.</p> <p>\"Where do you get your ideas from?\" - that is one of the great questions. To which the answer may be that there is a problem in the book, and this problem becomes a door. Through this door walks the necessary thing - in this case a child, or the sense of a child. If I stay very still, I will realise how much I already know about this human being, the rest I just make up. In between that first gift and the cutting and pasting that follows, comes the name. </p> <p>It is one of the reasons I like signing books. \"What's your name?\" I say. I am always happy to sign for a Bernadette - named for the film The Song of Bernadette, and born in 1943. Your average Martina is born in 1961, Dolores may indeed have a sad tale to tell, Saffria will confirm that her parents were a bit nuts, but John Paul - well he will seldom declare himself. He is 28, he is buying the book for his girlfriend, or worse, his mother, and \"What's her name?\" I say.</p>",
  "<p>Miners in Romania have unearthed the skeleton of a 2.5m-year-old mastodon, believed to be one of the best preserved in Europe, a local official said yesterday.</p> <p>They stumbled on the find during excavations in June at a coal mine in the village of Racosul de Sus, about 100 miles north-west of Bucharest, according to Laszlo Demeter, a local historian.</p> <p>\"This is one of the most spectacular finds in Europe,\" said palaeontologist Vlad Codrea, who examined the skeleton. \"For Romania it is unique.\"</p> <p>Codrea, of Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj, said 90% of its bones were intact, with damage to the skull and tusks. He also said that he hoped the find would help palaeontologists form a better image of the animals and vegetation present in the area 2.5m years ago.</p> <p>\"It is sensational. To discover a near complete skeleton is unique in Romania and a rarity in the world,\" said Marton Wentzel, a researcher of vertebrates at the Three Rivers Land museum in Oradea, western Romania. The mastodon is a mammoth-like animal which became extinct in Europe 2-3m years ago.</p> <p>The animal - three metres (10ft) high and seven metres long - was an ancestor of today's elephants. It is related to the mammoth depicted in the 2002 film Ice Age but fed on leaves instead of grazing and had straight tusks instead of curved ones. The reason this type of mammoth died out was probably due to climate changes, said Codrea.</p> <p>The skeleton will be fully dug out in two months' time, Demeter said. Research will be conducted on the bones and the skeleton will then be displayed in the nearby museum of Baraolt.</p>",
  "<p>He is tailed by autograph-hunters, makes groups of girls collapse into red-faced giggles and has the world's media hanging on his every word. He was even picked out by television cameras during last night's opening ceremony - for someone unknown in Britain until this year, Tom Daley is rapidly becoming a global star.</p> <p>The 14-year-old from Plymouth begins his quest for two gold medals with his partner Blake Aldridge in the 10m synchronised pairs diving on Monday morning British time, but such was the clamour to speak to him at a press conference yesterday it appears interest in the event will extend way beyond these shores. America, Canada and Australia in particular have all warmed to his fascinating story.</p> <p>Daley is already huge in China - he guaranteed Olympic qualification by finishing seventh in the World Cup in Beijing earlier this year and diving is a popular sport here - but he is wide-eyed, chipper and full of youthful charm, and a medal on Monday would make him an early contender for the face of the Games.</p> <p>\"I've had people come up and recognise me in the streets and around the Athletes' Village,\" Daley said. \"It's weird. Really weird. When you're little you always dream of being that person, the one getting recognised wherever he goes.\" </p> <p>His age allows him to speak modestly about his ambitions. \"I'm here for the experience, I'm not expecting to win anything. I'd rather work hard for London 2012 and win a medal there. I just want to go out there and have some fun. If I do something wrong this time, that's OK, I'll learn from it and take it on to 2012.\"</p> <p>For all Daley's understatement, the GB performance director, Steve Foley, believes that his events - after the synchronised pairs on Monday, Daley has to wait until Friday week to begin competing in the individual competition - are \"wide open\". In every other format, the Chinese are expected to dominate. Fortunately, Daley appears to be an absolute natural at dealing with the pressure. </p> <p>He also managed to please his sponsors yesterday, discreetly name-dropping several firms into his patter. When asked by a newsman from Montreal whether he regarded the Canadian diver Alexandre Despatie as a hero, Daley's answer was an exquisitely diplomatic \"yes\".</p> <p>Asked whether he felt the atmosphere in the Olympic Village reminded him of a school disco, he replied: \"I don't know. I don't go to school very often, but I do go when I can.\" Everybody laughed, but he was only half-joking. </p> <p>Naturally there were times when his polish slipped and it was easier to remember his actual age. His enthusiastic teenage slang was one reminder. \"It's absolutely massive being in the Village, just awesome, since arriving it's been absolutely phenomenal.\" Daley, who had just had his photo taken with Rafael Nadal, and breakfasted with Jamie Murray, was as star-struck as any teenager would be in the surroundings of the Village. He had, he revealed, also been taking advice from Sir Steve Redgrave (\"thanks to Team Visa\") on how to cope with the sleeplessness he suffers before big competitions. Soon he will be taking tips from Nadal on how to handle groupies. </p> <p>For now he has been spending his free time on other pursuits: printing stamps with his face on and sending postcards to his family, or surfing the internet in his room (\"beautifully furnished by B&amp;Q\"). His family party - some 12 people - are flying out this weekend. Until then he has the company of his team-mates. Daley is rooming with Aldridge, who, at the age of 26, is also competing in his first Olympics. Like the rest of the team you sense Aldridge is enthused and bemused by Daley rather than put out. </p> <p>However Aldridge feels, though, he'll have to get used to it. Daley is a born star, charismatic, handsome, and talented. If he handles pressure on the diving platform half as well as he does in front of a hundred or so journalists, he'll be a phenomenon.</p>",
  "<p>By the time you read this, world peace should have broken out. It should have broken out at precisely 8.08pm Beijing time yesterday, because International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge has made his traditional plea for a worldwide military truce for the duration of the games. Yet on the offchance that the Taliban are not laying in supplies of popcorn and preparing for a fortnight on the sofa, and US and British soldiers are not garlanding their tanks with flowers, now might be the time to question the IOC's preposterously idealised version of itself.</p> <p>There's nothing wrong with calling for world peace, of course - beauty queens do it all the time. But you do need to follow it up with something special in the swimsuit round, and one can't help feeling that the more of itself the IOC bares, the more hideous it appears. </p> <p>Strip away the grandiose statements, and an examination of how it treats the little guy should tell you all you need to know. Joey Cheek is the former speedskating gold medallist who co-founded Team Darfur, the international athletes' coalition which highlights the crisis in Sudan. Hours before he was due to travel to Beijing this week, the American's visa was summarily revoked by the Chinese government. Asked to comment on this blatant attempt to suppress an Olympic hero, an IOC droid explained \"non-accredited persons do not fall within the IOC's remit\". Isn't it amazing how swiftly one passes from being the winner of the Olympic Spirit Award to the status of \"non-accredited person\"? Two years ago Cheek won the honour following the winter games in Turin, after donating his medal bonuses to a sport aid organisation. Today, he lacks the requisite paperwork to merit even an IOC platitude. </p> <p>The decision to award the games to Beijing was always morally compromised - luminously so - and yet again the IOC find themselves highlighting their own absurdity. You can't call for an immediate cessation of hostilities around the globe and in the next breath decline to get involved in a serious humanitarian issue because a former gold medallist doesn't have the right accreditation pass. It's like demanding an end to poverty then refusing to give tuppence to a beggar on the basis that he isn't wearing a club tie. </p> <p>Amazingly, it's not even the IOC's most unedifying moment of the past fortnight. That honour belongs to their decision to suspend the entire Iraqi Olympic team on the basis that the country's National Olympic Committee had not been properly recognised by the IOC. Clearly, Iraq's real crime was not having the right paperwork, though before rescinding the ban on some (but not all) of the athletes, the IOC chuntered that it was because of suspicions of \"political interference in the Olympic movement\". </p> <p>Last week I asked them to clarify why they had never suspected political interference when one Uday Hussein was chairman of the NOC. Unfortunately, they were far too grand to comment, but having since read senior IOC member Dick Pound's book, I discover that they couldn't be sure that Uday was a political placeman. Thank God they didn't put two and two together and make five. </p> <p>Instead, they focus on issuing directives forbidding athletes from making any political statements. Surely it's time the IOC re-examined their definition of what it means to be political. It seems entirely acceptable for states to politicise the games by using them as propaganda, and for corporations to do the same (22 years of McDonald's sponsorship feels faintly agenda-driven). Only the athletes are warned not to step out of line. </p> <p>Priorities being what they are, the IOC did not bother to issue similar directives instructing China not to bulldoze homes to make way for the new Beijing. And yet they must have known this would happen, as so many games have been preceded by what we might euphemistically describe as a tidying away of humans who don't match the decor. Consider Mexico City, where police opened fire and killed hundreds of student protesters; or Atlanta, where the organising committee actually built the jail to which many people who committed new offences on the city statute book - like lying down in the street - were dispatched.</p> <p>This is not \"peace through sport\". These things happen precisely because the Olympic games are coming to town, and it should be the IOC's job to ensure that what is an amazing, inspiring world event does not come at the expense of the vulnerable. </p> <p>Perhaps the most chillingly revelatory moment in Pound's book is a quote from former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, explaining why it was preferable for games to be staged in closed societies or dictatorships. \"'Leesten, Deek,' he said to me at one point. 'For [the Olympics], it is much better to go to these countries. There will never be security problems.'\" This week, some Beijing street signs bore in the instruction \"Stay in to make space for foreign friends\". Stay in, stay grateful, stay schtum. </p> <p>Watching the IOC grease up to the Chinese government, one can only wonder sarcastically what on earth attracted this one set of appalling old waxworks to the other - apart from a straightforward Narcissus complex. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:marina.hyde@theguardian.com\">marina.hyde@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>For many people the sight of Russian tanks streaming across a border in August has uncanny echoes of Prague 1968. That cold war reflex is natural enough, but after two decades of Russian retreat from those bastions it is misleading. Not every development in the former Soviet Union is a replay of Soviet history.</p> <p>The clash between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia, which escalated dramatically yesterday, in truth has more in common with the Falklands war of 1982 than it does with a cold war crisis. When the Argentine junta was basking in public approval for its bloodless recovery of Las Malvinas, Henry Kissinger anticipated Britain's widely unexpected military response with the comment: \"No great power retreats for ever.\" Maybe today Russia has stopped the long retreat to Moscow which started under Gorbachev.</p> <p>Back in the late 1980s, as the USSR waned, the red army withdrew from countries in eastern Europe which plainly resented its presence as the guarantor of unpopular communist regimes. That theme continued throughout the new republics of the deceased Soviet Union, and on into the premiership of Putin, under whom Russian forces were evacuated even from the country's bases in Georgia.</p> <p>To many Russians this vast geopolitical retreat from places which were part of Russia long before the dawn of communist rule brought no bonus in relations with the west. The more Russia drew in its horns, the more Washington and its allies denounced the Kremlin for its imperial ambitions.</p> <p>Unlike in eastern Europe, for instance, today in breakaway states such as South Ossetia or Abkhazia, Russian troops are popular. Vladimir Putin's picture is more widely displayed than that of the South Ossetian president, the former Soviet wrestling champion Eduard Kokoity. The Russians are seen as protectors against a repeat of ethnic cleansing by Georgians.</p> <p>In 1992, the west backed Eduard Shevardnadze's attempts to reassert Georgia's control over these regions. The then Georgian president's war was a disaster for his nation. It left 300,000 or more refugees \"cleansed\" by the rebel regions, but for Ossetians and Abkhazians the brutal plundering of the Georgian troops is the most indelible memory.</p> <p>Georgians have nursed their humiliation ever since. Although Mikheil Saakashvili has done little for the refugees since he came to power early in 2004 - apart from move them out of their hostels in central Tbilisi to make way for property development - he has spent 70% of the Georgian budget on his military. At the start of the week he decided to flex his muscles.</p> <p>Devoted to achieving Nato entry for Georgia, Saakashvili has sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan - and so clearly felt he had American backing. The streets of the Georgian capital are plastered with posters of George W Bush alongside his Georgian protege. George W Bush avenue leads to Tbilisi airport. But he has ignored Kissinger's dictum: \"Great powers don't commit suicide for their allies.\" Perhaps his neoconservative allies in Washington have forgotten it, too. Let's hope not.</p> <p>Like Galtieri in 1982, Saakashvili faces a domestic economic crisis and public disillusionment. In the years since the so-called Rose revolution, the cronyism and poverty that characterised the Shevardnadze era have not gone away. Allegations of corruption and favouritism towards his mother's clan, together with claims of election fraud, led to mass demonstrations against Saakashvili last November. His ruthless security forces - trained, equipped and subsidised by the west - thrashed the protesters. Lashing out at the Georgians' common enemy in South Ossetia would certainly rally them around the president, at least in the short term.</p> <p>Last September, President Saakashvili suddenly turned on his closest ally in the Rose revolution, defence minister Irakli Okruashvili. Each man accused his former blood brother of mafia links and profiting from contraband. Whatever the truth, the fact that the men seen by the west as the heroes of a post-Shevardnadze clean-up accused each other of vile crimes should warn us against picking a local hero in Caucasian politics.</p> <p>Western geopolitical commentators stick to cold war simplicities about Russia bullying plucky little Georgia. However, anyone familiar with the Caucasus knows that the state bleating about its victim status at the hands of a bigger neighbour can be just as nasty to its smaller subjects. Small nationalisms are rarely sweet-natured.</p> <p>Worse still, western backing for \"equip and train\" programmes in Russia's backyard don't contribute to peace and stability if bombastic local leaders such as Saakashvili see them as a guarantee of support even in a crisis provoked by his own actions. He seems to have thought that the valuable oil pipeline passing through his territory, together with the Nato advisers intermingled with his troops, would prevent Russia reacting militarily to an incursion into South Ossetia. That calculation has proved disastrously wrong.</p> <p>The question now is whether the conflict can be contained, or whether the west will be drawn in, raising the stakes to desperate levels. To date the west has operated radically different approaches to secession in the Balkans, where pro-western microstates get embassies, and the Caucasus, where the Caucasian boundaries drawn up by Stalin, are deemed sacrosanct.</p> <p>In the Balkans, the west promoted the disintegration of multiethnic Yugoslavia, climaxing with their recognition of Kosovo's independence in February. If a mafia-dominated microstate like Montenegro can get western recognition, why shouldn't flawed, pro-Russian, unrecognised states aspire to independence, too?</p> <p>Given its extraordinary ethnic complexity, Georgia is a post-Soviet Union in miniature. If westerners readily conceded non-Russian republics' right to secede from the USSR in 1991, what is the logic of insisting that non-Georgians must remain inside a microempire which happens to be pro-western?</p> <p>Other people's nationalisms are like other people's love affairs, or, indeed, like dog fights. These are things wise people don't get involved in. A war in the Caucasus is never a straightforward moral crusade - but then, how many wars are?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Almond is a history lecturer at Oriel College, Oxford <a href=\"mailto:mpalmond@aol.com\">mpalmond@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A lack of team support has been Nicole Cooke's bugbear in major events in the past but that should not be an issue in tomorrow's Olympic road race here. On the other hand, the rapid progress made this year by the newcomers Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws means that Cooke can no longer take team leadership for granted; instead Great Britain go into the 77-mile race with three possible medallists.</p> <p>\"We are not having a single team leader. All the women are there by right, there is not one athlete streets ahead of the others, so our strategy is to ride a strong team race,\" said the team's performance manager, Shane Sutton, who will be in the support car devising tactics with the team manager Julian Winn as the race unfolds.</p> <p>Cooke will be the most fancied of the trio due to her huge experience in major events: a silver and two bronze medals in world road championships and the Commonwealth Games title in 2002. However, Pooley managed a top-10 placing in last year's world road race and became the only British woman to win a World Cup round this season when she won the Binda Trophy in Italy in March and Laws has performed above expectations in major races this year.</p> <p>Based on recent form, the diminutive climber Pooley should be the sharpest, having dominated her final warm-up event, a stage race in Brittany. Cooke did not race there, having elected to travel to Tuscany to train on her own. In the national championships at the end of June it was Pooley who looked stronger than Cooke, although the Welsh woman still managed to outsprint her at the finish.</p> <p>The Kenyan-born Laws was an unknown until this season, with a background in tough cycle touring and mountain-bike events when she made the move from Australia to Britain, and she is understood to have regained her form despite a minor fracture in her ankle in a training accident in early June.</p> <p>She had less than two weeks off her bike but in late July, when the British held a media day at the Newport velodrome, she could be seen with her foot raised and an ice pack on the ankle. She has not raced since, although she posted a promising time in a 10-mile time-trial before the British team flew out.</p> <p>\"We are in with a really good shout; we have three women who can race well but they will have to take their chances,\" said Sutton. \"Sometimes having three possible leaders can work against you because you don't have any committed team workers but, given the nature of the course, which should see a lot of the field fall away, we could have a big presence in the front group. Not many teams have that strength in numbers.\"</p> <p>Sutton and the GB cycling performance director, Dave Brailsford, hope that the three women will between them cover every escape of any significance, unlike in Athens, when Cooke was on her own in the decisive lead group of seven. Then she had no option but to lead the chase when Sara Carrigan of Australia and Judith Arndt of Germany escaped; she came close to crashing on one corner, and ended up third in the sprint for the bronze medal.</p> <p>\"I think perhaps we have one of the strongest teams on the start line,\" was Cooke's verdict. \"With a team around you, you can cover everything. If we can put the other teams on the defensive, so they are reacting to our game plan, hopefully one of us can pull it off.\"</p> <p>According to Sutton, the course will also suit the big favourite for the event, Holland's Marianne Vos, the 21-year-old who pipped Cooke for last year's overall title in the World Cup. With gold medal chances tomorrow, in the road time-trial and in the points race on the track, the 2006 world champion is set to be Holland's biggest star of the Games.</p> <p>Much has been made of the seven-mile climb that is tackled twice after the run-out from Beijing to the circuit. It should be suited to the climbing talents of the British trio. Sutton feels the descent will give the field time to recover but that the finish next to the Great Wall, 25 miles outside the city, will be ideal for Cooke.</p> <p>\"Nicole likes the course and she likes the finish. With 500m to go you go round a bend and it comes at you, it levels off, then boots up again. If it was a sheer speed finish Nicole might struggle a little bit but it's more of a finish for a strong rider and it could play into her hands.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sports competition and politics are separate, China insisted this week, an impression faintly undermined by the presence of more than 80 heads of state at last night's opening ceremony, and the gathering suspicion that Beijing 2008 is shaping up to be one of the most political Games in modern Olympic history. </p> <p>In the past few days alone, we have heard George W Bush - somewhat miscast as the world's Jiminy Cricket - condemn the Chinese government's human rights record in the strongest terms of his presidency, just hours before Team USA revealed their flag-bearer would be the track star Lopez Lomong, a Sudanese refugee. The co-founder of Team Darfur, Joey Cheek, an Olympic gold medallist himself, had his visa revoked, while the very air that hangs over the Chinese capital seemed to have become a battle between environmentalists and the meteoric rise of the Chinese economy. </p> <p>At ground level, Free Tibet protesters have echoed the dissent that dogged the Olympic flame's progress across the world before being bundled away by police. During last night's spectacular the immediate area surrounding the Olympic Park was eerily clear, the thousands of sightseeing Beijing locals who had thronged it in recent days penned back to a more manageable distance. These scenes lie out of shot of the TV cameras for now, but the question of how long the images can remain controlled looms larger by the hour.</p> <p>Peter Norman, the Australian sprinter who stood in solidarity as Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their gloved fists that historic night in Mexico in 1968, said before he died: \"Once you've earned that right to stand on that podium, you've got that square metre of the world that belongs to you. What you do with it is up to you within limits.\" This coming fortnight the world will discover where China deems those limits to lie, as athletes consider whether to flout the aggressively re-emphasised Section 51 of the Olympic charter, which states that \"no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas\".</p> <p>Even without overt protest, it might be difficult to say where the sport ends and the politics begin. Already the rivalry between the United States and China has an echo of Cold War days, when the medals chase seemed cast as an extension of the arms race. So invested with expectation is tomorrow's China-USA basketball clash that one can only hope it doesn't shape up as a modern skew on the notorious gold medal game at the 1972 Munich Games, which saw the United States lose to the Soviet Union after a controversial period of extra-time that left even the official scorekeeper refusing to sign the scoresheet. Whatever tomorrow's result, it will be watched in person by both Bush and the president of China, Hu Jintao.</p> <p>Just as big ticket football matches are increasingly co-opted as a backdrop for corporate hospitality, so the Olympics can feel like a plot device in the global power struggle. Hu will hold talks with Bush tomorrow - before the game - but over the past few days has had bilateral meetings with the presidents of Vietnam, Algeria, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, Belarus, Montenegro, Laos, Serbia and Brazil, and Kim Jong-il's No2. The Dear Leader was a notable no-show, as was Pervez Musharraf, the impeachment-threatened Pakistan president, who cancelled at the eleventh hour. Somewhere in the Beijing Games' vast organisational structure, someone must have sighed with relief. At least it was one less minefield for the placement</p> <p>There is simply no space to cover the spider's web of tensions between the leaders waving from the VIP seats last night, with relations ranging from the expediently cordial to the openly poisonous. </p> <p>Were Olympics ever thus? Certainly they were in the ancient world, where the sacred truce for the duration of the Games meant Olympia was often a setting for d\u00e9tente. An ancient statue of Pantarces of Elis honoured not just his victory in the equestrian events but the fact he had used the Games period to broker peace between the Achaeans and the Elians and secured the freedom of both sides' prisoners of war. (Team GB's equestrian hopefuls have a slightly clearer schedule.) </p> <p>As for the modern Olympic story, how often it has seemed ineluctably political. Berlin, Munich, Mexico, Moscow, Los Angeles... the world has witnessed individual actions taking on vast political resonance, as in the case of Smith and Carlos, or political forces snuffing out the individual, as in the case of the murdered Israeli athletes. Even the torch - that fabled symbol of peace - is not what it seems, a faux-ancient tradition confected for Adolf Hitler's Berlin Games and filmed by Leni Riefenstahl for her propagandist Olympia. Against such histories it is impossible to predict how the Beijing narrative will unfold. But on the evidence so far, it's unlikely to be a quiet one.</p>",
  "<p>The French Basque country was preparing itself for a tense summer holiday season yesterday after bomb squads were called in to defuse several explosive devices planted at resorts across the region.</p> <p>More than 1,000 holidaymakers, among them Britons, had to be evacuated overnight from their hotels and apartments after police received an anonymous tip-off that five bombs had been left in different towns in south-west France near the border with Spain.</p> <p>Yesterday police located three of the devices - one at a popular \"holiday village\" in the town of Arcangues, another at Arcangues' tourist information office and a third on the high-speed TGV railway line at the town of Ondres in the Landes region. The homemade explosives - one of which was a can of petrol strapped to a detonator - were described by local authorities as \"weak and defective\".</p> <p>Searches were ongoing yesterday at the other sites mentioned by the caller, which included the casino in Biarritz and a hotel in Bidarray formerly owned by Alain Ducasse, the Michelin-starred chef who quit the region last year after a series of attacks on his restaurant. A holiday resort in Anglet was also searched. </p> <p>Police said that although they had so far found nothing, they would keep looking until they were sure no bombs remained. </p> <p>News of the bombs revived fears that the region could be hit by Basque separatist attacks at the height of its tourist season. The south-west of France, with its long, sandy beaches and dramatic mountainous scenery, is a perennial favourite with tourists from all over Europe, including Britain, but the threat of violence has often threatened to scare away holidaymakers.</p> <p>Jean Espilondo, the mayor of Anglet, where about 600 tourists, including some British families, were ordered out of their beds before dawn, said there had never been an attempted attack on a location where there were so many people. \"There are a tiny minority of people who are capable of taking others hostage in the name of their cause,\" he said. </p> <p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for yesterday's bombs. Eta, the biggest separatist group, tends to target the Spanish region of the Basque country rather than the French, and the makeshift devices did not bear its hallmarks. The smaller Irrintzi, the most active organisation in the French region, has carried out numerous attacks on tourist sites in the past and threatened in April to carry out \"armed actions in all French and Spanish territory\". </p> <p>But experts cautioned yesterday that these latest bombs did not carry the group's usual slogan, \"the Basque country is not for sale\". </p> <p>A statement from the French interior minister, Mich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie, who is from the region and whose own summer house was one of the first targets of an Irrintzi attack in 2006, said she condemned \"the irresponsible and scandalous attitude\" of those who had planted the bombs, and had asked police to use all available means to find those responsible.</p>",

They sport fetching blue bridles, the same hue as the sky. A 15-minute amble over the dunes and we're almost alone. In the estuary, a couple of waterskiers fall off often; three jetskis buzz annoyingly, but we've heard they'll soon be banned; a shoal of dinghies compete for a regatta cup; the other side of the sandbar there are bottlenose dolphins. </p> <p>Camp is made in a dune's hollow and we go even madder. It is beautiful to throw a frisbee badly, to skim stones and to scream and shriek with few people about to annoy. It is chilly when we first dip toes into the water, but in a bracing, tonic way, so I tell the kids. The boogie board stays dry, the pop gets drunk, crab sandwiches get eaten and we all agree that this is the most fun time we've had on a beach almost ever. </p> <p>The weekend is made by the cool luxury of Llety Bodfor, which is in the pastel terrace. This is a boutique B&amp;B run by interior designer Ann Hughes. Her calm, understated style is perfect for Aberdovey, and would not be out of place in coolest Cornwall or even California, where she and husband Gareth used to live. Our bed has gorgeously slinky sheets and blue walls that glow in the brilliant seaside light. Dinner is from Walker's chippy and we eat our haddock on the quay. Seagulls, half silver, half foam, half bird and half fish, scream and shriek and we think that Aberdovey's not half bad. Not Abu Dhabi, but not half bad at all. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Llety Bodfor, 1-2 Teras Bodfor, Aberdovey (01654 767475, <a href=\"http://www.lletybodfor.co.uk\">lletybodfor.co.uk</a>) rooms \u00a350-\u00a3160 B&amp;B.

  "<p><strong>Supreme silence</strong></p> <p>The Supreme Temple is the centrepiece of the Workers' Cultural Palace - a Mao era name that assures anonymity - but the temple grounds are gorgeously tranquil, ignored by everyone making a beeline to the overwhelmed adjacent Imperial Palace. Take time to explore this haven of imperial temple architecture and its yellow-tiled halls; it's virtually a miniature Forbidden City. Roam the hushed grounds of the surrounding park bordering the palace moat; there's even a tennis court within earshot of the Forbidden City.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Supreme Temple, directly north east of Tiananmen Gate.</p> <p><strong>Martial arts in Ritan Park</strong></p> <p>A good place to take a breather from sightseeing is Ritan Park, Beijing's former Altar to the Sun, one of many altars where imperial sacrifices were performed to appease nature. Immerse yourself in energetic training with English-speaking taiji quan (tai chi) and bagua zhang (\"eight trigram palm\") instructors. Following the poses of these ancient martial arts in such a tranquil setting can inspire an affinity for Beijing that weeks of sightseeing cannot. To find a teacher, check the classified pages of free expat magazine The Beijinger (ask for a copy at your hotel) under Martial Arts &amp; Boxing or call the Beijing Milun School of Traditional kung fu which gives lessons near the west gate of Ritan Park.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> +0086 139 1072 4987; <a href=\"http://www.kungfuinchina.com\">kungfuinchina.com</a>; one-to-one class Y150 (\u00a311) for 90 minutes, group class Y500 for eight classes. </p> <p><strong>Bike the hutong</strong></p> <p>Hutong tours along Beijing's ancient alleyways are big business, but often slavishly follow fixed routes. Jump on a hired bicycle and keep one step ahead of the wrecking ball, weaving through Beijing's magical warren of crumbling lanes. With children laughing, men slurping beer and playing chess outside Qing dynasty courtyard gates, the Beijing of old is yours for the taking. Pack a map perhaps, but ditch the compass - lanes run east-west or north-south. It's easy to do yourself: hutong alleys riddle the whole of Beijing within the second ring road, but the best areas are in the Dongcheng district - especially south-east of the Drum Tower and north-east of the Forbidden City or around the Shichahai lakes north of Beihai Park.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bike hire: from your hotel or hostel, or the rental operator just west of the Novotel Peace Hotel on Jinyu Hutong, off Wangfujing Dajie. </p> <p><strong>A breather at the Drum &amp; Bell</strong></p> <p>After staggering up and down the steep steps of the Drum Tower and the Bell Tower - Beijing's surviving historic towers about a mile due north of the Forbidden City - take a breather on the simple roof terrace of the unpretentious Drum &amp; Bell Bar, which attracts a mixed Chinese and foreign crowd. Sandwiched between its namesake monuments, you can forget Beijing's high-rises and modern architecture: the surrounding traditional hutong rooftops are what Beijing's really all about. If it gets hot up top, sink into one of their marshmallow-soft sofas in the casual downstairs bar. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 41 Zhonglouwan Hutong (+10-8403 3600). </p> <p><strong>Maoist slogan tour</strong></p> <p>A minority sport perhaps, but spotting Cultural Revolution slogans can tie in neatly with sightseeing. The 798 Art District is carpeted in red Maoist maxims, although some have been touched up - ask gallery owners to decipher them. Faint slogans still survive beneath the windows of 34 Dongjiaomin Xiang - a road east off Tiananmen Square renamed Anti-Imperialism Road during the Cultural Revolution - in the former Foreign Legation Quarter where the foreign powers had their embassies in the early 19th century. Explore the charming alley of Nanluogu Xiang in Dongcheng district with its bars, cafes and hutong hotels - and track down the slogan opposite the Plastered T-shirts shop at number 61, which proclaims: \"For industry study Daqing, for agriculture study Dazhai, for the whole nation study the People's Liberation Army\". </p> <p><strong>Take a pew</strong></p> <p>You may think that China's spirituality is pitched somewhere between Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and Communism, but Christianity is growing fast. The high profile East Cathedral (St Joseph's Church) is a mainstay of touristy Wangfujing Dajie, but St Michael's Church, the South Cathedral and the North Cathedral are just as interesting. Not only is their architecture graceful, Beijing's churches are also refreshingly cool retreats from the fierce summer sun. If you can't get in, knock on the gates and someone should come and open them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> St Joseph's Cathedral, 74 Wangfujing Dajie. St Michael's Church, 11 Dongjiaomin Xiang. North Cathedral, Xishiku Dajie. South Cathedral, 141 Qianmen Xidajie. </p> <p><strong>Toy town</strong></p> <p>Embedded delightfully within a famous hutong area a short hop west of the Confucius Temple, Bannerman Tang's Toys and Crafts specialises in colourful displays of handmade collectibles and folk craft pieces. The traditional Chinese version of Weebles (bu dao weng - literally \"old man who won't fall over\") go elbow to elbow with clay figures, and kites jostle for space with colourful feline-shaped tiger pillows. Items are made according to traditional methods. The hutongs outside - and east of the nearby Lama Temple - are ideal for exploring.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 38 Guozijian (+10-8404 7179, <a href=\"http://www.rbtys.com\">rbtys.com</a>). </p> <p><strong>Silk Road Supper</strong></p> <p>The Turpan Restaurant in Beijing's largest Muslim district brings the flavours of Xinjiang province - which is three times the size of France - direct to your tabletop. The decor (plastic grapes, cavernous interior) won't win any style awards, but you're here for Xinjiang lamb kebabs, nang (filling naan-like discs of bread), pulled noodles or - if you can get a gang together - a whole roast lamb. Alcohol is on the menu, so now's your chance to try erguotou, Beijing's mind-bending and highly flammable spirit or its up-market cousin from Guizhou province, Maotai. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 6 Niujie Beikou (+10-8316 4691); approx Y40pp.</p> <p><strong>Evening drinks at The Tree</strong></p> <p>When its last home was flattened by city planners, The Tree uprooted and replanted itself in this sheltered corner of Sanlitun - one of Beijing's most famous bar districts. With over 40 Belgian brews from Chimay to Delirium Tremens, The Tree has one of the best selections of beer in town, essential when local brews (Beijing, Yanjing and Tsingtao) start to taste samey. Vibrant at weekends, The Tree is inviting at any time and the wood-fired pizzas enjoy citywide fame.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 43 Bei Sanlintun Nan (+10-6415 1954, <a href=\"http://www.treebeijing.com\">treebeijing.com</a>). </p> <p><strong>China Culture Center</strong></p> <p>Whether it's walking the Beijing back streets, watching a cricket-fighting contest (an insect version of cockfighting), hiking around rural Beijing or fathoming the mysteries of the I Ching, the China Culture Center (CCC) offers quirky tours around the capital and beyond, with parallel lectures on Chinese culture.

Around 45km east of Badaling, Jiankou is a far more authentic Great Wall experience. Hefty tracts of overgrown masonry snake along mountainous ridges and plunge down hillsides in a stupendous, jaw-dropping landscape. It's a 40-minute walk from the village of Jiankou to the barely visited but far superior rear section the wall, but watch your step - even though you can walk a considerable way along the wall itself, some sections have collapsed. You can visit alone, but it's safer with companions. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Take fast bus 916 (60-90mins) from Dongzhimen long-distance bus station to Huairou; then hire a minivan (one hour; Y200 return) to the rear Jiankou section. Admission Y20.</p> <p><strong>Ming murals</strong></p> <p>The careless restoration work and slapdash rebuilding of so many old monuments means that finding genuine pre-Qing dynasty history is a tall order in China. The Ming dynasty Buddhist murals at Fahai Si - Sea of the Law Temple - are in their original hues, but you'll need to pack a small torch: the frescoes are swathed in gloom to protect their 500-year-old pigments. Nearby is the tranquil Tomb of Tian Yi, a famous 16th-century eunuch. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fahai Temple (admission Y20; open 8am-4pm). Take subway line 1 to Pingguoyuan station, then a taxi (Y10).</p> <p><strong>Temple town</strong></p> <p>Its skyline pierced by Buddhist pagodas, the alluring walled town of Zhengding outside the Hebei provincial capital Shijiazhuang presents a crumbling snapshot of dynastic China. An easy day exploring the temples is enough to get a feel for Zhengding's historic layout. The city walls badly need maintenance but it's worth the trip to see Dafo Si (Big Buddha Temple), housing a huge, 10th-century bronze statue of Guanyin (the Goddess of Mercy). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Express trains from Beijing West train station take 2\u00bdhrs to Shijiazhuang, then bus 201 on Daocha Jie (Daocha St) just south of the train station for the short journey to Zhengding. Admission Y60.</p> <p><strong>Fortress town</strong></p> <p>You can visit the small walled town of Shanhaiguan on a day trip, but spending the night here allows more time for the town's historic hutong charms to fully work their magic. A section of the Ming dynasty's old town may have had a pre-Olympic facelift, but the original wall is intact and a magnificent maze of hutong alleys survives. A few kilometres north of town, the Great Wall meets the sea at Laolongtou and across the border in Liaoning province are further remnants of the bastion at Jiumenkou.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The 9.20am D5 train to Shenyang from Beijing train station arrives in Shanhaiguan at 11.27am. </p> <p><strong>Pastoral Peking</strong></p> <p>Festooned with Maoist slogans and surrounded by hills, the ancient stone hamlet of Chuandixia is a bucolic refuge from Beijing. Wander the narrow lanes, peek into old stone courtyard houses and immerse yourself in a panorama of ancient China. Consider overnighting in one of the ancient homesteads, where you can just turn up and get a bed from around Y15 and rise with the cock crow rather than the jackhammer. If you get a taxi, ask your driver to return via Lingshui, a nearby village dating from the Tang dynasty.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Take Line 1 of the metro to the Pingguoyuan stop, then a taxi (Y140 round trip); or the 7.30am or 12.30pm bus direct to Chuandixia from Pingguoyuan. Admission: Y20.</p> <p><strong>Great Wall trek</strong></p> <p>The heart-pumping four-hour, 10km Jinshanling to Simatai trek - around 70km north east of Jiankou - is an excellent way to explore a long, dramatic section of the Great Wall. Pack sunscreen and as much water as you can carry. Limpet-like hawkers proffer refreshments when you run dry, with prices rising the more parched you appear, so try to look indifferent. On the hike along the wall you'll pass staggering mountainous scenery and sequences of collapsed watchtowers, many plundered for their bricks by farmers. Most hotels and youth hostels book tours for the hike, leaving at around 6am, returning to Beijing by around 7pm. It's a long bus journey to the wall itself with meals and guides generally thrown in.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tours cost around Y180. Tickets: Jinshanling admission Y40; Simatai admission Y40; rope bridge crossing Y5.</p> <p><strong>Jimingyi</strong></p> <p>This tiny historic town is China's oldest surviving post station and the antithesis to modern-day Beijing. Ringed by a collapsing wall, the once well-to-do town has totally missed out on China's economic boom. Some of its temples survive, even if many of its courtyard houses have vanished, but behind the decay and neglect lurk vestiges of Qing dynasty grandeur in its mighty town gates and occasional spirit walls (which faced the residences of prosperous families). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The bus to Shacheng takes 2hrs from Beijing's Liuliqiao long-distance bus station; ask for the Jimingyi drop off, then walk 2km to Jimingyi across the overpass. </p> <p><strong>Yunmeng mountain</strong></p> <p>The stunning forested mountains of Yunmengshan north of Beijing deliver cool temperatures and fresh air. The clamber from the foot of Yunmengshan to its highest point takes four to five hours and there's a camp site where you can overnight - take everything you might need, from food and water to a flashlight and insect repellent. There are also comfortable hotels in the area.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bus 936 from Dongzhimen long-distance bus station to Yunmengshan. </p> <p><strong>Death valley</strong></p> <p>Their remoteness makes the Western Qing Tombs a much more serene experience than the over-visited Ming Tombs north of Beijing. In all, there are four emperors' tombs; the principle mausoleum is Tailing, resting place of the emperor Yongzheng, but it's the Confucian Imperial tomb design and distant mountain panoramas that create such a unique impression. The rest of the Qing emperors were buried at the Eastern Qing Tombs, on the other side of Beijing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The best way to reach the Western Qing Tombs is to hire a car with a driver; ask your hotel or Top-A (+10 6438 1634) can arrange. </p> <p><strong>Sacred escape </strong></p> <p>In the far-flung suburban Western Hills, the revered area of Badachu is not just famous for its constellation of Buddhist temples, it's also an excellent spot for hiking in Beijing's nearest range of mountains. The name Badachu (Eight Great Sites) commemorates the eight Buddhist shrines and pagodas that crown its various peaks, including the splendid Buddha's Tooth Pagoda at Lingguang Si (Temple of Spiritual Light).</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bus 972 from Pingguoyuan metro station on Line 1; get off at the Badachu stop.</p>",
  "<p>The British houseparty is an institution. How better to mark a special occasion, celebrate with the family or, once in a blue moon, gather old friends and catch up? If you don't happen to have a grand pile of your own, numerous companies will rent you one. Just remember one crucial rule of engagement - the organiser bags the best bedroom. </p> <p>To this end, I am arriving early at Chaffeymoor Grange, near Bourton, (with Tim and a bootfull of farm produce for dinner). Unusually, this house is bookable for short breaks in high summer. The gardens and a south-facing terrace hold the promise of long evenings, lazy chatter and the clink of ice in glasses. Unfortunately the weather has other plans. </p> <p>First things first. We race each other upstairs to inspect all 10 bedrooms before the hoi polloi arrives. Instead of one five-star room among several also-rans, we find a choice of grand doubles - with garden and countryside views, en suites or separate bathrooms across the landing - and attic-y bedrooms with roll-top baths up narrow staircases at the rear (the house must have been extended over the centuries). What a quandary. We like them all.</p> <p>The consensus, when everyone arrives (by car, except one, who gets a train from London to Gillingham), is that there aren't any duff ones. \"They're missing a trick by not showing all these lovely rooms on the website,\" remarks someone. </p> <p>\"Anyone for bubbly?\" another pipes up, fetching more glasses from the utility room, adding, \"Imagine all the empties lined up in there after a hen party.\" </p> <p>We won't need to imagine it, if those black clouds don't clear. Fat chance of tennis or croquet outside, let alone sunbathing. </p> <p>Ooh, this is a nice kitchen to cook in, I think, basting a couple of chickens. \"Good music system,\" says one of the chaps, laying the table. We're foregoing the dining room along the hall to sit at rustic benches in a cottagey eating area with an open fire, two steps up from the vast kitchen. </p> <p>The youngest member of the party is tucked up in the cot provided and we don't hear a squeak till breakfast (possibly because the house is so big). Tim and I manage an early morning, though brief, garden exploration, before raindrops become a torrent. </p> <p>Pity - we're only getting half the deal here, as summer blooms are flattened in the downpour. The lawns are slippery and it's pointless crossing a wooden bridge over an ornamental lake to a gazebo. </p> <p>After a laughter-filled pub lunch in deepest Dorset, we are forced to ditch a proposed visit to Stourhead and return to Chaffey (as we are affectionately calling the house), to read or play board games. Someone even strikes up on the piano in the hall. \"At least this is a nice house for staying indoors,\" comes one observation. </p> <p>I'd like a bit more ornament or a few rugs downstairs, but one chap hates having to look at other people's knick-knacks. \"It just needs more people,\" he says, reminding us that Chaffey can accommodate more than double our number. </p> <p>It's no hardship to pass another evening indoors, with plentiful food, wine and banter. \"This is like Christmas in the middle of summer,\" says one. \"Oh well,\" adds another, as the drawing room fire is lit. \"If it was boiling hot, we'd only have said: 'Wouldn't it be nice to stay here in the winter?'\" </p> <p>After supper, the women settle by the blaze to play cards, as rain lashes against mullioned windows. The men push off into the games room to play pool. It's like being in Peter's Friends (without the weird stuff).

  "<p>It has always been hard to work out who fired the first shot in any of the many conflicts that have broken out in the Caucasus. Ever since June 1992, when the tiny mountain enclave of South Ossetia won the first round of its bid to detach itself from Georgia, the two sides have been intermittently at war. But the flare-ups in the last decade have been skirmishes, and for a while it looked as if peace had broken out. </p> <p>The weapons used yesterday - tanks, multiple rocket launchers and fighter aircraft - made the fighting qualitatively different. Observers had little doubt the operation to take South Ossetia back under Georgian control bore the hallmarks of a planned military offensive. </p> <p>It was not the result of a ceasefire that had broken down the night before. It was more a fulfillment of the promise the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, made to recapture lost national territory, and with it a measure of nationalist pride.</p> <p>The assault appears to have been carefully timed to coincide with the opening of the Olympic games when the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, was in Beijing. Tom de Waal of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting and an expert on the region said: \"Clearly there have been incidents on both sides, but this is obviously a planned Georgian operation, a contingency plan they have had for some time, to retake [South Ossetia's capital] Tskhinvali. </p> <p>\"Possibly the Georgians calculated that with Putin in Beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months, because the Russians won't take this lying down.\"</p> <p>If Georgia calculated that Russia would be inhibited by Putin's absence, it soon backfired. Within hours, the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, chaired a session of the security council in the Kremlin, ordering units of 58th Russian army to retake Tskhinvali. His military credentials are so weak, he had no other choice.</p> <p>The Russians are far from blameless. They have a long and dirty history of dividing and ruling, fomenting strife to weaken opponents in a critical frontier zone. But Russia could claim in the UN security council to be defending its own citizens and its own peacekeepers. Sabine Freizer, Europe programme director of the International Crisis Group said: \"Russia should not be blamed for the fighting, but Russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate, and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into South Ossetia.\" Events may have already overtaken this. A proxy war risks becoming an open conflict between Russia and Georgian troops, not just in the tiny enclave of South Ossetia, but in another breakaway statelet of Abkhazia.</p> <p>Gen Mamuka Kurashvili, a Georgian military officer in charge of operations, said on Rustavi 2 television that Georgian forces were moving \"to establish constitutional order in the region\", an ominous phrase used in the past by the Russians to justify its two wars to crush the separatist movement in Chechnya.</p> <p>But it was this situation that Russia warned of, when America, Britain and most EU governments recognised Kosovo. It was also why the French and German governments were so insistent on thwarting US attempts to give Georgia a so-called membership action plan at this year's Nato conference in Bucharest. </p> <p>If Georgia now were a member of Nato, as Saakashvili has pushed for, the military organisation would have a duty to rush to its defence.</p>",
  "<p>My birthday has just been and gone, so I spent the week performing my traditional lamentations (\"I still can't roller-skate! I'm still not 5ft 7in! I still haven't had sex in a truly exotic position and I really can't be bothered - or bend at the necessary angles - now!\") and mournfully recording various memento mori. </p> <p>This year I noted that rag and bone men have passed out of history in my lifetime. When I tell the next generation how my sister and I used to rush to the window when we heard the clip-clop of horses' hooves coming down the road and watch people bring out their junk to pile on the cart, it will sound as quaint to them as my grandma's tales of boiling cobbles for soup did to us.</p> <p>Still, the mental fissures that opened up under the weight of this realisation were as nothing compared with those created by the results of a survey by the Travelodge chain, which disseminated without warning the startling news that nine out of 10 British children have never been to a UK beach. Oh, they've been to the seaside abroad - 78% of five- to 12-year-olds have paddled off the coasts of France and Spain - but barely a 10th of them have braved a Blighty beach.</p> <p>Can you believe this? I can't. I cannot conceive of a generation of children growing up with more experience of There than Here. On the other hand, if I grant that it is true, it does answer every question I have wanted answered during my many trips on public transport vehicles stuffed with modern children (which are actually variations on a single query, namely - why are you so vile, badly behaved and hateful?) in one swift stroke.</p> <p>When I were a lass, trips to the seaside were not just the highlight of the year, they marked the limits of human happiness. My dad and I once finished a riotous day - of cramming tuppences into one-armed bandits, visiting Gypsy Petulengro (who took one look at the chinless, bucktoothed child in front of her and told me, \"I'd not get me hopes up of meeting a tall, dark, handsome stranger if I were you\"), standing in the sea up to our knees until my calves went numb (I honestly thought my legs had fallen off. I was very young, and I've never been bright) and deciding whether the quavering translucent mass at our feet was a strange sea-creature redolent of all the mysteries ever told about the briny deeps or a spunk-filled condom - with a fish and chip supper, eaten out of the paper as we walked down Blackpool beach. \"It doesn't,\" said Dad as we reached the end of the Golden Mile, \"get much better than this.\" I believed it then and I believe it now. And if your ice-creams are bolted between downpours, your sandcastles built against a backdrop of useless windbreaks and if a swim is as likely to end with you covered in hepatitis A and tar as a glowing sense of wellbeing, so be it. You'll still have enjoyed yourself, and learned a valuable lesson about the proportions in which joy and misery generally exist in life that will arm you well against disappointment in future years.</p> <p>No wonder children today are so horrible. They are having their hopes raised and their horizons broadened by sun-kissed beaches, warm waters and lazy, hazy, crazy days every summer. No wonder the average eight-year-old looks at adults with rage and despair in his eyes and refuses to do as he's told. No wonder he's kicking the back of my bus seat and dribbling Coke down my neck. His parents showed him Eden and then slammed the doors, at the end of a fortnight, on the dream. Suddenly, I don't feel so bad about my age.</p>",
  "<p>One year on from recording top-12 finishes in all four major championships Justin Rose has found this year a bit of a let-down. It is safe to assume that a tie for 36th at the Masters, a missed cut in the US Open and a tie for 70th on his emotional return to Royal Birkdale for the Open Championship last month was not what the 28-year old Englishman had in mind after the excitement of 2007.</p> <p>Things are looking up again, though. After a brilliant second round of 67 over a fearsomely difficult course here the former prodigy is level par and only one shot off the lead held by the American JB Holmes in the 90th USPGA Championship. Amid much carnage Rose made four birdies and dropped only one shot, on the 18th hole, which was his ninth.</p> <p>This was, however, a round built upon proficiency on the wickedly sloping greens that have provoked so much consternation already this week. On the back nine Rose used the shortest club in his bag a mere 11 times. The question now is whether that sort of scrambling is a sustainable formula for success at a level of the game where Rose has been found wanting on more than one occasion.</p> <p>\"Tiger [Woods] has made winning majors look very easy and, therefore, for some of the younger guys, it's easy to get frustrated when you are not doing it yourself,\" he said. \"I look at someone like Nick Faldo, who didn't win his first major until he was 30, so I know there is no rush and we all have to start somewhere.</p> <p>\"Still, you can't always keep saying, 'Well, I'm gaining experience, I'm gaining experience.' There is a time to start believing, this is the time to do it and the time is now. It's a bit of a Catch-22. I think experience in majors is essential, just the environment, the golf course, and I think the art of patience in majors is the key.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere on the leaderboard Henrik Stenson is the next best European on one over par after Sergio Garc\u00eda finished with a double bogey on the penultimate hole to be two over par. Stenson, the big-hitting former World Match Play champion and third at last month's Open behind Padraig Harrington - who, like Ian Poulter, is five over par so far - would appear to have the ideal game for a course this long and demanding. But even he sounded more than happy to be done for the day.</p> <p>\"It was tough to shoot a good number today,\" he said. \"I was just fighting for par on most holes. It is just so hard to get close to the flags. The pins all seem to be tucked away behind these little humps and ridges.\"</p> <p>Harrington claimed his recent exertions have caught up with him. \"I ran out of steam,\" he said after bogeys on his last two holes for a total of 145. \"It was a struggle. I did my best to be ready for the week but clearly I'm not. The harder I tried the worse it got. I haven't got the focus this week. I'm just not with it.</p> <p>\"Obviously I'm still just having a hangover after winning the Open. You would love to try and go with the flow and that's what you try and do but the harder you try the worse you make it. Certainly that was the case for me.\"</p> <p>Sadly, mention must also be made of the score turned in by Colin Montgomerie. Equalling his previous worst round in a major championship - an 84 at Muirfield in 2002 - the Scot finished on 20 over par and in 150th position. The only players he beat were five American club professionals.</p> <p>\"It was very difficult out there and I made it more so,\" said the eight-time Ryder Cup player, whose weary body language over the closing few holes spoke of his misery more eloquently than any words. \"I got off to a bad start and kept it going. The only consolation is that the putt I holed on the last green was the same one I made in 2004 to clinch the Ryder Cup.</p> <p>\"This was the toughest set-up I have ever seen. It really was most difficult, just very, very severe. I'll just have to go away and regroup and come back again.\"</p> <p>Still, at least he behaved with some sort of dignity in what must have been a difficult situation. \"Colin really struggled on the greens,\" said Jim Furyk, one of his playing companions. \"And it's tough when you get to the point where you know you can't make the cut. He tried his best, though. He hung in there. And he was actually very pleasant to play with today. He handled it like a professional.\"</p> <p>Asked about the Ryder Cup, Montgomerie claimed it was \"the farthest thing\" from his mind. But with only three weeks remaining until a final determination is made, any lingering hope he had of receiving a Faldo wild card must now be gone. It is the end of an era.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Why has fighting broken out?</strong></p> <p>The South Ossetians and Georgians have been sniping at each other for several weeks and patience on both sides has finally snapped. South Ossetia and Georgia's other breakaway region, Abkhazia, have enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s but Tbilisi has never recognised the loss of its territory. The dispute between Georgia and the two regions was called \"the frozen conflict\" because the issues remain unresolved, but there was no fighting. The heat began to rise this year when the west recognised Kosovo, against Russia's advice. The South Ossetians and Abkhazians argued that if Kosovo could be independent, then so could they. </p> <p><strong>What is the basis of the region's claim to independence?</strong></p> <p>The Ossetians are descendants of a tribe called the Alans. Like the Georgians, the Ossetians are Orthodox Christians but they have their own language. In Soviet times, the Ossetians had an autonomous region within Georgia. The Georgians say the Ossetians cooperated with the Bolsheviks and tended to be more pro-Soviet. Their ethnic kin live across the border in the Russian region of North Ossetia, so today they feel more drawn to Russia than to Georgia and many have Russian passports. </p> <p>Abkhazia on the Black Sea coast was also an autonomous region of Georgia in Soviet times. It has a mixed population of Abkhaz, Mingrelians, Greeks, Armenians, Russians and Georgians and a small but significant Muslim minority. Thousands of ethnic Georgians fled their homes in Abkhazia during the civil war in the early 90s and now live as refugees in Tbilisi and Moscow.</p> <p><strong>Why has Russia become involved?</strong></p> <p>Russia says it cannot stand aside because many of the people in the breakaway regions are its citizens. Georgia accuses Russia of meddling in its internal affairs and supporting the separatists, although Russia's peacekeepers are supposed to be in a neutral role. Georgia accuses Russia of double standards in suppressing its own separatist rebellion in Chechnya while encouraging separatists in Georgia. Russia has become more engaged in the region since Georgia expressed an interest in joining Nato, the very idea of which appalls Moscow.</p> <p><strong>What might happen next?</strong></p> <p>So far, this has been a proxy war, with Russia encouraging the separatists, but Russia and Georgia could find themselves in direct conflict. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, today accused Georgia of aggression and warned that a response was inevitable. Georgia said Russian jets had started bombing its territory. </p> <p><strong>What are the wider implications?</strong></p> <p>The conflict could widen out further still, with former Soviet republics supporting Russia and the US and Europe backing Georgia. The root of the problem is that the world community cannot agree on rules for the independence of small regions.</p>",
  "<p>In this summer of 2008, it feels as if our future is crystallising before our eyes. Food shortages, the credit crisis, escalating oil prices, a melting Arctic ice cap and the failure of the Doha trade negotiations: one or all of these issues could be the harbingers of profound change for our global civilisation. And just 16 months from now, in December 2009 in Denmark, humanity will face what many argue is its toughest challenge ever: to agree the fundamentals of a climate treaty to succeed the Kyoto protocol.</p> <p>It all seems to have happened so quickly. Just two years ago we received warning of an imminent disaster - a climatic shift that \"could easily be described as hell: so hot, so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive\". The Cassandra was no deep green fundamentalist, but James Lovelock, the acclaimed scientist, pro-nuclear advocate and past adviser to Margaret Thatcher, who, 27 years earlier, had surprised the scientific community with his book Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP). At a time when reductionist science (which breaks down the world into small units in order to understand it) prevailed, Lovelock took the opposite approach, describing Earth as a single, self-regulating entity, whose function can be disturbed by human activities. It became one of the most influential books of the 20th century.</p> <p>In The Revenge of Gaia (Penguin), published in August 2006, the 86-year-old Lovelock concluded that \"we have unknowingly declared war on Gaia\", and that our only hope of rescue lies in a massive deployment of nuclear energy. The book found a wide readership, yet it failed to mobilise humanity to swift action. His nuclear solution instead divided environmentalists, and the bleakness of his vision was difficult to bear. And again his science went against conventional wisdom, for the most widely accepted assessment of future climate change at the time indicated that his bleak outcome was only a remote possibility.</p> <p>Other, more conventional readings of our climatic future became available in 2006, the most influential of which was Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. His computer presentation, which became both a successful movie and a bestselling book, opens with dramatic footage of collapsing ice shelves, melting glaciers and hurricane damage, then goes on to catalogue deleterious changes in ecosystems as diverse as tundra and coral reefs. If Lovelock diagnosed Gaia as having a fever, then Gore laid out the symptoms detail by detail. His examples were drawn primarily from refereed scientific publications in the world's leading journals, backed up with personal anecdotes from many of the scientists involved. My own book The Weather Makers (Penguin) draws on the same body of data, as does the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and countless other books and articles written at the time.</p> <p>An Inconvenient Truth was fundamental to the great climatic awakening that occurred late in 2006. I have no doubt that in years to come whole books will be devoted to analysing this shift in global public sentiment, which occurred between mid-August and late September. It is exceedingly rare that a film or book makes such a profound impact, yet An Inconvenient Truth marked the moment when the fossil-fuel industry and its political pawns lost their decades-long grip on public opinion, and perhaps inevitably Gore - who had been Clinton's vice-president and had won the popular vote in the most divisive election in recent US history, only to be denied the presidency by the supreme court - was excoriated in the rightwing press. It was as if the bitter race for the presidency had spilled out into climate science. I was lecturing at universities in middle America in 2007 when Gore and the IPCC were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize. The naked anger and cynicism - at everything from Gore to peace prizes and Norwegians in general - were frightening.</p> <p>There are dangers in summarising complex science in a 90-minute presentation. Gore was excoriated for explaining that many glaciers are melting - faster indeed than any climatic model predicts - but failing to mention that a very few are growing. Furthermore, his explanation of the causes of climatic change in the geological past was of necessity simple, as was his narrative of contemporary climate change. Both result from a complex interaction of factors, as is well illustrated by the relationship between global warming and hurricane activity. After An Inconvenient Truth was published, researchers discovered that only around half of the increase in global hurricane activity could be directly attributed to an increase in Earth's average temperature. None of this, in my opinion, detracts from the veracity of Gore's exposition.</p> <p>Few books about climate change have been written by the meteorologists and atmospheric physicists that dominate the field. One charming exception is Willi Dansgaard's memoir Frozen Annals (Niels Bohr Institute, 2005). Dansgaard's involvement with climate science goes back to 1947, when he was sent to northwestern Greenland by the Danish weather service. Much of his life has been spent on the Greenland ice cap, drilling, retrieving and analysing the ice cores that provide the key to our understanding of past changes in climate. His book is surprisingly funny and tender, and makes obvious how hard-won is our basic knowledge of climate science.</p> <p>The first attempt at sampling the Greenland ice involved cutting pieces from bergs - an extremely hazardous practice that almost cost Dansgaard his life. While cutting into one, he writes, \"with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off. Fortunately, I fell on to the main part of the chunk, but now it started turning round so I ended up in the water . . . I began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice. There was none . . . I was not afraid of being so close to drowning, but of deserting Inge and our two kids, and I was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance.\" Just \"at that moment a true miracle occurred\" - the arrival of a \"rowboat sent out from Klaushavn\".</p> <p>A critical advance occurred in 1964, when an American-Danish collaboration began at Camp Century, perched high on the Greenland ice cap. The \"camp\" was a massive series of tunnels gouged in the ice, its facilities powered by a nuclear reactor. Spawned of the cold war, the facility had been envisaged as the first stage of a monstrous instrument of conflict, involving the sequestering of 600 nuclear missiles in 4,000km of tunnels. To support it, a city for 11,000 people was to be built inside the mighty ice cap - one of the most hostile and remote environments on Earth. The military planners, however, had failed to remember that ice flows, which means that tunnels and caverns drilled in it soon become hopelessly distorted.</p> <p>Camp Century was destined to play a very different role, for it was here that the first deep drilling into the Greenland ice cap occurred. Dansgaard conveys beautifully what it was like to work in such a bizarre environment, along with the wonders revealed when analysing that core - the discovery of evidence for the little ice age, the medieval warm period, and the great ice age that covered northern Europe and North America. Then, at the very bottom - 1.4km down - the researchers found evidence of a distant time when Earth was slightly warmer than it is today. They had, they realised, pierced right through the 100,000 years of a full glacial cycle - an entire ice age - and had come out the other side into a world that existed 130,000 years ago. It was a triumph they hardly dared hope for.</p> <p>Elucidating the cyclical nature of past changes in climate was the first great achievement of the ice-cap drilling project. One of the more striking cycles they discovered was a rapid warming that occurred every 1,500 years or so throughout the past 100,000 years. These oscillations between warm and cold conditions are now known as Dansgaard-Oeschger events.</p> <p>A sophisticated understanding of the great climatic cycles has permitted a new approach to the climate problem that finds its closest parallel in the \"wiggle matching\" used by stock-market analysis. William Ruddiman is a climatic historian whose book Ploughs, Plagues and Petroleum, published by Princeton in 2005, uses this approach to identify evidence of human impact on the climate system, by identifying precisely where we are in the current cycle and comparing the trend with earlier ones. We are, he explains, 12,000 years into a cooling phase which, judging from previous cycles, should continue for tens of thousands of years more. Instead the world is warming. But what is most remarkable about Ruddiman's work is the evidence it provides for an initial disruption to the climate system that occurred long before the industrial revolution - around 8,000 years ago. </p> <p>It was then, at the dawn of agriculture, that the \"wiggle\" of the current cycle first departed from earlier patterns - for instead of cooling, Earth's average temperature remained remarkably stable. Ruddiman thinks that this was caused by carbon and methane being released into the atmosphere from early agriculture and the destruction of forests. In his account, human activity and the great cycles struck a delicate balance that allowed the flowering of civilisations. He also sees evidence in the ice cores for the consequences of the Black Death (a drop of around two parts per million of CO2 as forests grew over abandoned fields, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere), as well as other historic events. Aspects of his work remain highly contentious, yet I believe that Ruddiman's realisation that the gaseous composition of Earth's atmosphere is an exquisitely sensitive barometer of changes to life itself represents a great breakthrough.</p> <p>Now that the majority of politicians, industry leaders and the public are convinced there is a climate problem, the focus is on what to do. The most influential assessments of the problem's scale are doubtless those of the IPCC, whose projections of various outcomes form the basis of global negotiations and national action plans. One of the most influential of these projections concerns the extent to which Earth's surface will warm over the next century. The lower bound is 1.4\u00b0C; the upper bound is 5.8\u00b0C. This is an extraordinary range of possible impacts - 1.4\u00b0C poses some threat, but 5.8\u00b0C is widely recognised as sufficient to induce a Lovelockian Ragnarok. The chance of either outcome, according to the IPCC, is small - less than 10%, and so political dialogue has come to concentrate on the mid-range of the projections.</p> <p>The moment of truth will arrive in December 2009, in Copenhagen, when the world's political leaders will come together to decide the basis of a new global treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol. It's no overstatement to say that the Copenhagen protocol, as it may well come to be known, will play a large role in deciding the fate of humanity. It will come into force in 2012, and if it fails to deliver we'll have to wait until 2020 for a replacement. That will be too late.</p> <p>A number of recent publications assess the costs versus the benefits of action to combat climate change. Among the most influential, and the most hotly contested, is the Stern review on the economics of climate change, a dense 692-page argument, published last year, the most famous finding of which is that \"the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting\". Nicholas Stern's argument was challenged almost immediately in Cool It by the Danish statistician Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist (Cambridge University Press).</p> <p>Lomborg does not doubt that global warming is occurring, nor that it is caused by humans, but almost alone among commentators he finds reason to welcome it. In Europe, he explains, only 200,000 people die from excess heat each year, while 1.5 million die from cold. His message is simple: more warming, less death. Lomborg's style is marked by glib, misleading associations. Even if the sea rises, Lomborg says, we shouldn't worry - we'll just put up dykes. With dykes, he asserts, some nations might end up with more land than they have today. And so the arguments go on, from rising seas to extreme weather events to malaria and other tropical diseases, the collapse of the Gulf Stream, food shortages and water shortages. In one case after another, Lomborg asserts that it's cheaper and better to do nothing immediate to combat climate change, but to invest in adapting to its consequences. It is in great contrast to Stern's painstaking and detailed analysis, and it entirely fails to dent Stern's case.</p> <p>In A Question of Balance: Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies (Yale), the respected economist William Nordhaus asks how to deal most cost-effectively with the climate problem. He accepts the projections of the IPCC as a correct basis on which to undertake his analysis, and sets out to examine five policy options, ranging from \"do nothing\" through to \"ambitious\" proposals such as those advocated by Gore and Stern. He concludes that the ambitious proposals are disastrously expensive, and should be avoided. But do the IPCC projections reliably reflect future changes in climate?</p> <p>In 2007, scientists began comparing real-world trends with the panel's projections. They found that for the key performance indicators - the rate of warming, the rise in sea level and CO2 accumulation - real-world changes were at the upper bound or beyond the worst-case scenario presented by the IPCC. Further evidence that climate change is moving faster than we thought can be found at the north pole. The sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean has glistened brightly into space for at least 3m years, and by reflecting the sun's energy it acts as a refrigerator that cools the entire planet. But where the ice melts, the dark ocean is revealed, and that captures solar energy and turns it into heat. </p> <p>In the summer of 2005, the rate of ice loss accelerated dramatically and has remained high ever since, the summer of 2007 seeing the greatest loss of Arctic ice ever. The scientific community is split on how the melting will turn out this year. A recent survey of Arctic specialists indicated that the majority consider a loss as great as that of 2007 to be unlikely, yet by June 2008 signs of a great melt were emerging and a senior adviser to the Norwegian government was warning that this may be the Arctic's first ice-free year. As I write, the rate of loss, while still well above average, has slowed somewhat. Yet even now it's impossible to predict. We can only project that if this summer's melt trajectory follows recent decades, by September this year the Arctic ice cap will have lost around half of its remaining ice, and be just 2.2m square kilometres.</p> <p>Most of those interested in climate science nowadays access information online, and one of the most significant of such contributions was recently posted by James Hansen, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute, and his colleagues, who have provided a partial explanation for these changes. They revisited a key piece of science underpinning the IPCC's work - the findings about how much warming a given amount of atmospheric CO2 pollution would produce - and discovered that, when viewed over the longer term, Earth's climate system is about twice as sensitive to CO2 pollution as is illustrated in the panel's century-long projections. One conclusion they drew is that there is already enough greenhouse gas pollution in the atmosphere to cause 2\u00b0C of warming - bringing about conditions not seen on Earth for 2m to 3m years, and constituting, according to the authors, \"a degree of warming that would surely yield 'dangerous' climate impacts\".</p> <p>Hansen and his colleagues pointed to a new understanding of how long it takes for the full warming consequences of a given amount of greenhouse gas to be felt. They concluded that we could expect to feel a third of any warming in the first few years. As Hansen and his colleagues put it: \"Sea-level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record, in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human-made forcing. This indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed, and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed.\"</p> <p>They also make a useful discrimination between climatic \"tipping points\" and \"the point of no return\". A tipping point is that at which the greenhouse gas concentration reaches a level sufficient to cause catastrophic climate change, while a point of no return is reached when that concentration of greenhouse gas has been in place sufficiently long to begin an irreversible process. Humanity is currently suspended between a tipping point and a point of no return, and the point of no return is likely to be reached within two decades.</p> <p>In summarising their findings, the researchers state that \"if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm\". This, they believe, can only be achieved by phasing out all conventional coal burning by 2030, and by aggressively reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by capturing it in growing tropical forests and in agricultural soils. That a rapid phase-out of coal is simply not enough is elegantly illustrated by the fact that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would remain above 350ppm for 200 years were a coal phase-out achieved within the next decade or two, and nothing else done.</p> <p>In his analysis, Nordhaus does identify one economically effective strategy worth pursuing. Called the \"low-cost backstop\", it revolves around identifying and developing some as yet unknown technology to combat the problem. Possible candidates include \"low-cost solar power, geothermal energy, some non-intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon-eating trees\".</p> <p>Writing in the New York Review of Books, Freeman Dyson has explored the unappealing option of such trees. The graph that first alerted humanity to the climate problem - drawn up by Charles David Keeling to show the CO2 increase from 1956 to the present - might, Dyson argues, hold the key to the solution. The graph has a generally rising line, with jags, like saw teeth, along it, which indicate a spike in CO2 each autumn in the northern hemisphere and a dip each spring. The difference between the minimum and maximum each year is around six parts per million, and it is due to the growth, then leaf fall, of the forests that grow across North America, Europe and Asia. It turns out, Dyson says, \"that about 8% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year\".</p> <p>If only a way could be found, he muses, to permanently sequester that carbon, we would go a long way towards solving the climate crisis - hence the genetically modified trees. But the truth is that all trees are carbon eaters. They grow from the air by drawing CO2 into their leaves, and there solidifying it to build their wood, bark and leaf tissues. Trees are congealed CO2. What we need is a way of transforming the carbon they capture into an inert state. It turns out that humanity has had the capacity to do this for thousands of years, and is now on the brink of doing it on a very large scale.</p> <p>The process of charcoal-making is called pyrolysis, and involves the heating of any biological matter in the absence of oxygen. The result is the generation of a synthetic gas, or a crude-oil like material, and charcoal. If the gas or oily matter is captured, it can be used to generate electricity or power transport. The charcoal is largely carbon (representing one-third to half of the carbon in the biomass) and it is inert. Indeed, the tenacity with which charcoal resists rotting, even when buried in the soil, is clear from C14-dating, which uses ancient charcoal from hearths or fires as much as 60,000 years old.</p> <p>Modern pyrolysis involves machinery that captures flue gas or oil, and needs no external inputs to run the machine (some of the gas being used to heat the biomass). It's already being used on a small scale on farms, for urban garbage disposal (where 1,000-tonne units are deployed) and in forestry. On farms it has multiple benefits, for the charcoal can be ploughed back into the soil, where it balances acid soils, aids soil moisture retention, adds nutrients and acts as a habitat for soil fungi and bacteria. A farmer pyrolysing crop waste gains four benefits: 1) as usual, he gets to sell the commercial part of his crop; 2) he gets to generate electricity or transport fuel; 3) where carbon is traded, he can potentially sell the carbon he sequesters; and 4) by adding charcoal to his soil, he will increase the chances of getting a better crop the following year.</p> <p>With so many benefits, why is pyrolysis not more widely used? Because pyrolysis machines are expensive, and farms are mostly still family businesses. If farmers are ever to be able to afford the machines, they'll need to be paid around $37 per tonne for the carbon they create. They'll also need to be living in areas with carbon trading schemes that allow charcoal as a recognised method of carbon sequestration.</p> <p>While the developed world could go it alone with pyrolysis, unless China and India can be induced to take a lower carbon path than the west, there is absolutely no hope for us. While both maintain formidably tough international negotiating positions, there are signs of change, particularly in the energy sectors of both countries. China has a target for renewable energy of 10% by 2020, and is embarking on the largest nuclear power programme currently being developed, while India is pursuing wind and hydro power.</p> <p>Were the leaders of either country seeking a guide to determining a negotiating position in Copenhagen, they could do no better than Oliver Tickell's just-published book Kyoto2 (Zed Books), which provides a big-picture approach to the prevention of climatic catastrophe. In essence, Tickell provides a blueprint for a global climate treaty. He documents the failings of the Kyoto protocol, then goes on to summarise the latest climate science, including the work of Hansen and his colleagues. The replacement to the Kyoto protocol, Tickell writes, must work effectively to achieve a level of atmospheric CO2 below 350ppm. At the heart of the proposal is a global trade in carbon with a series of reducing caps sufficiently rigorous to bring about such an outcome. </p> <p>One of Tickell's most telling criticisms of Kyoto is its neglect of tropical forests as a means of sequestering carbon. The destruction of rainforests causes around 18% of the carbon going into the atmosphere annually, yet only a single project concerning tropical forests has been approved under Kyoto's clean development mechanisms. These allow for polluters to gain credits by investing in a variety of ways that reduce greenhouse gases. Dyson's analysis of the Keeling curve demonstrates just how powerful forests can be as sequesterers of carbon. It's widely acknowledged that Kyoto's successor must develop mechanisms that encourage the protection and regrowing of tropical forests.</p> <p>Tickell's discussion of market mechanisms is densely technical, yet much of it reads as common sense. His emphasis on the urgent need for government regulation is also cogent and refreshing, for he recognises that carbon trading is necessary, but not sufficient to solve the problem. He calls clearly for governments to regulate so as to increase efficiency of energy use, to protect forests and to mandate approaches such as clean coal technologies, as well as discussing the need to limit population. Reading Kyoto2 gives one hope that there is a way forward. But will such recommendations ever be agreed to, and can they be carried out in time? </p> <h2>The books to read</h2> <p><strong>George Monbiot</strong><br>George Marshall, author of Carbon Detox (Gaia Books), understands the psychology of climate change and our inability to get to grips with it better than anyone else I have read. Mark Lynas's Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet (Fourth Estate) is a lucid and deeply researched account of the predicted impacts of climate change, one degree at a time. In Kyoto2: How to Manage the Global Greenhouse (Zed Books) Oliver Tickell presents a global programme for cutting greenhouse gas emissions that is both radical and realistic. </p> <p><strong>Caroline Lucas</strong><br>Seeing Green by Jonathon Porritt (currently out of print) changed my life. After reading it, I marched straight to the office of my local Green party to sign up. George Marshall's Carbon Detox is an upbeat and inspiring guide to lowering your carbon footprint. The Flood (Saqi Books), Maggie Gee's dystopian vision of a flooded future, with its well-drawn characters and lively prose, shows how the poor will always be the first to suffer the effects of climate change.</p> <p><strong>Mark Lynas</strong><br>In Kyoto2, Oliver Tickell makes a radical suggestion: that instead of trying to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide, we should instead go \"upstream\" and regulate the production of carbon-based fossil fuels. Think of a garden sprinkler: if you want to stop the lawn getting wet, you don't try to catch each drop as it falls - you turn off the tap.</p> <p>The World Without Us (Virgin Books) by Alan Weisman contains a disarmingly simple but wonderfully clever idea: what would the planet look like if we all disappeared overnight? The perfect springboard for a much more engaging and fascinating discussion of humanity's environmental impact.</p> <p><strong>Fred Pearce</strong><br>Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (Penguin Modern Classics), published in 1962, was environmentalism's tipping point. Before Silent Spring, we worried about saving wildlife; afterwards we feared our own species would drown in a toxic tide of chemicals. In 1979 came Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (OUP) by James Lovelock. Not since Charles Darwin's Origin of Species has any book so shaken science's sense of how our world works. John Reader's Man on Earth (published in 1988 and currently out of print) is an overlooked masterpiece about the ecology of human cultures.</p> <p><strong>Leo Hickman</strong><br>Robert Henson's Rough Guide to Climate Change (Rough Guides) is the best pocketbook primer on the subject. On its publication in late 2006, it was sent to every MP with a short questionnaire, including the question \"How important a concern is climate change?\" Hundreds answered, the majority of whom said it was the most pressing issue of our age. Gordon Brown never responded.</p> <p>Hide Tide by Mark Lynas (Picador) is a journey through the climate change \"hot spots\" of the world. It's the testimonies of the people Lynas meets who are already suffering from the onset of climate change that produce the most persuasive argument for us to urgently face up to the challenge ahead.</p> <p><strong>Laurie David</strong><br>Earth in the Balance (Longman), written by Al Gore 15 years ago, is doubly fascinating to read now. It makes you realise how much he was right. I devoted myself to the issue of climate change after reading Ross Gelbspan's Boiling Point (Basic Books). If you look at Keith Bradsher's High &amp; Mighty (PublicAffairs US), you will never walk past an SUV again without shaking your head.</p> <p>What Al Gore is to awareness of global warming, William McDonough is to the solution. His Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things (Rodale Press) is the only book about the environment that is actually waterproof. Also read anything by Gus Speth or Bill McKibben.</p>",
  "<p>Sometime in the late 60s, the novelist and poet Emanuel Litvinoff took a trip back to Whitechapel in the East End of London, where he had grown up in the 1920s and 1930s. He expected to find some version of the Jewish neighbourhood that had formed him, streets \"full of synagogues, backroom factories and little grocery stores reeking of pickled herring, garlic sausage and onion bread\". But there was almost nothing left: the war and a new wave of immigration had changed the district for ever. \"I felt indescribably bereaved,\" he wrote, \"a ghost haunting the irrecoverable past.\" That evening he began a memoir, \"My East End Tenement\", out of which grew his irresistibly wry and unsentimental account of a vanished world, Journey Through a Small Planet. First published in 1972, it has just come out as a Penguin Modern Classic.</p> <p>The area around Brick Lane in the early years of the 20th century was, Litvinoff recalls, \"a village remote in spirit from the adjacent cosmopolitanism of the great city\". Its way of life was \"that of the small Jewish towns scattered across the lands of eastern Europe\", more like Odessa or Krakow than London: \"We shared the same Sabbaths and festivals . . . sang traditional songs in the same minor key, laughed at the same Jewish jokes.\" Copies of Die Zeit were passed around from family to family, and the local caf\u00e9s resounded with arguments about anarchism and communism, waged over glasses of lemon tea.</p> <p>On the day he retraced his steps, Litvinoff found that his old tenement building, at least, remained. The same broken tiles were in the passage, and one window ledge still bore the jagged inscription \"E.L.\", carved so many years before. Much had happened in the intervening decades, to Litvinoff and to the Jewish people. His memories came back so forcefully not least because the disappearance of his own eastern European ghetto now demanded to be seen in the context of the extinction of countless others.</p> <p>Litvinoff has said that when he was at school, it did not occur to him how the history of his forefathers \"fitted into the kind of history we were taught . . . what, in any case, had history to do with a boy's dreams and disappointments?\" By the time he came to write Journey Through a Small Planet, however, his memories of the rattle of sewing machines, the shouts in Yiddish, the \"slums boiling with humanity\", had a more general import: \"I have the habit of thinking about that past in collective terms, partly because my memories have become generalised, but chiefly because in my childhood we were still members of a tribal community.\" He points out that he \"began to be haunted by the sufferings of Jews in Europe because these unknown victims took on the features of my own family\". The ghetto he vividly portrays is a \"small planet\" because it is so self-enclosed, but also because it encapsulates so much, coming to stand for the lives, and deaths, of millions across Europe.</p> <p>Patrick Wright, a friend and long-time champion of Litvinoff, who has written a substantial, superb introduction to the new edition of Journey, points out that Litvinoff's novels - once praised, now out of print - also, in different ways, address historic upheavals filtered through his memories of the East End. In The Lost Europeans (1960), for instance, a Jew returns to Berlin after the war to claim restitution for his family's material losses. Taken to a deprived quarter of the German city, the protagonist reflects that \"it lacked the vulgarity, the noise and overspilling vitality, the profuse, untidy, over-ripe garbage-strewn squalor of slum life in Whitechapel\".</p> <p>A Death Out of Season (1973), meanwhile, is an enthralling fictional account of the notorious siege of Sidney Street in 1911, when hundreds of policemen and a unit of the Scots Guards fought a pitched battle in Stepney against a small number of Latvian revolutionaries, including the mysterious Peter the Painter. The novel shows the East End in its role as - to use Litvinoff's phrase - \"a clearing-house for the international revolutionary movement\", but is also, as the critic Valentine Cunningham argues, \"a profound salute to Jewish memory\".</p> <p>In a chapter of Journey called \"The God I Failed\", Litvinoff characteristically makes light of his own years as a revolutionary in the Young Communist League. He tried to read Marx, but \"the words buzzed around in my brain like a cloud of gnats\". The main spur to his attending meetings was Hannah Fishbein: \"long brown hair, sweet smile, schoolgirl freckles and plump young breasts I blushed to notice . . . I was shaken by a sweet and terrible violence.\" When Mickey, the branch secretary, feared that his own chance with Hannah was disappearing, Litvinoff was expelled from the League for \"Trotskyism\".</p> <p>Elsewhere, however, he has recalled an adherence to communism more serious and binding. In the mid-1930s, he began to lose his idealism about the Bolshevik revolution and, as a result, suffered \"a period of total depression - because communism was something to hold on to as a possibility for the future. If you lost communism, the future held out no hope at all.\" It mattered all the more because the first thing Litvinoff had been told on joining the comrades was the marvellous fact that \"in the Soviet Union, antisemitism has been abolished\".</p> <p>Litvinoff's brother Abie became a hero in his school for refusing to read the part of Shylock - he got six canings for his insolence. Kids from across the road would snarl: \"You killed our Lord, dincha? So I can pinch yer ball.\" But what he calls his first \"serious\" encounter with prejudice came as a result of having failed the exam to get into grammar school. \"I was so nervous I couldn't hold the pen in my hand. I knew it was a matter of life and death. If you didn't go to a grammar school, you went to a factory, and the factory was your doom.\"</p> <p>The authorities ignored his request to pursue a career in printing, and instead sent him to Cordwainers Technical College, near Smithfield meat market, where he was the only Jewish boy. From the first roll call, the headmaster pretended to have difficulty saying his name, which became \"Litpotskyoff\", \"Lavatoryoffsky\" and, ultimately, \"Pissoffsky\". Even then, he says, he \"did not generalise from this experience. The barbarities . . . seemed localised, like the stench of decaying offal\" that permeated the college's classrooms.</p> <p>Litvinoff left as soon as he could, and for the rest of his teens struggled at numerous, usually hateful, short-term jobs - as a fur nailer, a porter carrying carcasses, a door-to-door seller of magic medical powder. For short periods he was down-and-out, living off Jewish welfare agencies or in dosshouses, and he got into trouble: \"I was a very, very difficult boy.\" He whiled away hours in Smart's cinema and in Bethnal Green public library, and at night-time he haunted Soho, where caf\u00e9s would stay open till four in the morning, and revellers would stand him a cup of soup. A friendly George Bernard Shaw greeted him on emerging from the Caf\u00e9 Royal, and he recalls seeing the \"wickedest man in the world\", Aleister Crowley, wearing \"a beautifully tailored herring-bone suit\".</p> <p>Litvinoff was working for a while at a furniture factory when, as he was stirring a pot of glue, the first words of a poem unexpectedly came to him. \"If I failed to understand how the words came\" - the fumes presumably played their part - \"I knew with extraordinary elation that they were a message from inner space.\" He was destined to be a writer, a poet. Not long afterwards, having managed to find more regular work, he devoted his spare time to a novel, \"half as long as the Bible\", which he later dismissed as \"an awful pedestrian account of every moment I could remember\" of his East End childhood, and which his elementary schoolmaster was shocked to discover was \"full of sex and squalor\". (Litvinoff eventually burned the manuscript \"page by page\".)</p> <p>What he calls the \"problem of identity\" - his Jewish identity - did not properly arise until the political atmosphere in the capital changed and \"snotty-nosed kids with whom one had exchanged fairly harmless abuse suddenly appeared buckled and booted in black uniforms, looking anything but juvenile as they tramped through the district shouting: 'We gotta get rid of the Yids.'\" Oswald Mosley's blackshirts began to patrol the borders of the ghetto, and gangs of youths would tell Litvinoff to fuck off back to Palestine. \"Antisemitism was a sort of unwanted inheritance,\" Litvinoff has written. \"You were lumbered with it. Now it was on the doorstep again.\" He recalls ridiculing Mosley, but sensed in his followers \"a kind of hysterical evil. It permeated to the marrow of my Jewish bones.\"</p> <p>In a parallel development, he began to feel a kind of \"self-contempt\", a \"secret conviction that people were justified in despising me\". The ghetto \"seemed a small, parochial world . . . old-fashioned and superstitious\". He began to regard the Hebrew letters on shops as \"grotesque and provocative\" and became affronted by \"the herring women down the Lane, plunging their chapped and swollen fingers into the open barrels of pickled fish\". </p> <p>\"The second world war was my salvation,\" Litvinoff says. Initially a conscientious objector like \"almost every young man in the tenement where I had lived\", he signed up when he began to comprehend the consequences for Jews of a German invasion of Britain. In the army, he had clean clothes and regular food for the first time in years, and grew in confidence: \"My Jewish neuroses vanished as I learned to turn the occasional antisemitic remark against its perpetrator with nonchalant good humour.\"</p> <p>Stationed at first in Glasgow then Belfast, he found that kitchen work left him time for writing. A few verses printed in the anthology Poems from the Forces, as Wright details, \"brought a letter from Herbert Read, who then published Litvinoff's slim volume The Untried Soldier in the Routledge New Poets series\". He attracted the attention of the publisher John Lehmann, and made contact with Alex Comfort, at the time a young anarchist poet. One poem in The Untried Soldier expressed - inarticulately, Litvinoff now says - his response to the sinking of the Struma, full of Jewish fugitives, after it had been refused permission to dock at Istanbul and the British government had prevented it continuing onwards to Palestine. All except one of the more than 750 passengers died. It was a decisive moment for him; his khaki was \"a badge of shame\". Never again, he has written, would he think of himself as an Englishman. \"In the middle of this century any Jew in Europe was condemned as surely as if he was born with an incurable disease.\"</p> <p>Having become an officer, Litvinoff was put in charge of a pioneer corps composed of refugee Jews, mostly from Germany. It was \"an extraordinary unit. You could have staffed a university.\" He began to enjoy himself, and he got married, to Irene Maud Pearson - \"I'll show you my poetry if you show me yours,\" she said, having met him at a dance at Catterick Camp. As Cherry Marshall, Pearson would, after the war, subsidise Litvinoff's writing with her earnings as a successful model (said to have \"the slimmest waist in England\") and as the owner of her own modelling agency. </p> <p>Living in a basement flat in Hampstead, the demobbed Litvinoff became a freelance writer, turning in reviews and pieces for journals such as Tribune. (A couple of these were, to their author's delight, praised in person by Dylan Thomas.) He became a member of a group of writers, many of them refugees, who frequented the Cosmo and other Swiss Cottage caf\u00e9s - Elias Canetti, Dannie Abse, Peter Vansittart, David Sylvester, Jon Silkin, Comfort and others. \"Some went to Hollywood,\" Abse recalls now, \"some went to jail.\"</p> <p>Herbert Read turned down his second volume of poems, A Crown for Cain - a \"better book than the first\", according to Abse - which crushed Litvinoff, until it was published by Falcon. But Read was soon to play a part in the event for which Litvinoff is still probably best known. The \"anarchist knight\" was in the chair at the initial poetry platform of the newly formed ICA when Litvinoff read out, in the presence of TS Eliot himself, a poem that attacked Eliot for republishing antisemitic works such as \"Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar\". (Eliot's poem includes the lines: \"A lustreless protrusive eye / Stares from the protozoic slime . . . / The rats are underneath the piles. / The jew is underneath the lot. / Money in furs.\") It caused uproar, and Litvinoff - who, at the age of 93, still courses with energy reciting his most famous poem - was accused of using Eliot to get noticed.</p> <p>Litvinoff was working at the Jewish Observer and Middle East Review when, in 1956, Cherry Marshall organised the first western fashion show in the Soviet Union - a remarkable initiative, the full story of which Wright tells in his introduction to Journey. Marshall was determined to put on a \"spectacle\" of \"colourful, feminine clothing\", and the Soviet authorities built a pavilion for the show in Gorky Park, complete with catwalk. It was enormously popular and the models were greeted with rapturous applause. \"Not a single order was forthcoming from Russia,\" Wright says, \"but the designs were enthusiastically stolen, even if they weren't bought.\"</p> <p>Litvinoff attended as the delegation's \"business manager\", but had, he told me, his \"own objects\" when he was there, \"an undercover operation\". Having been asked to deliver a letter from the head of the World Zionist Organisation to Moscow's chief rabbi, he found himself at the Great Synagogue with the service in full swing. In an instant he was transported back, with a \"melodramatic feeling of uneasiness\", to the synagogue off Brick Lane. Before long, it became clear that in walking to meet the chief rabbi, he had \"walked into the Jewish problem in the Soviet Union. The street outside the synagogue was full of people in rags. They had nowhere to go, and no future.\" He began to hear stories of persecution, of prison camps, of Stalin ordering the closing down of schools and theatres, and the melting down of Yiddish type. It was the ultimate desecration of Litvinoff's adolescent hopes of a new political dawn.</p> <p>On returning to Britain, he launched a campaign on behalf of Jews in the Soviet Union: \"I came back with this extraordinary feeling, a sense of guilt really. I felt that more should have been done in the 1930s to awaken public opinion and mobilise political pressure on the Nazis. So I started a newsletter. And it became a successful campaign.\" Litvinoff edited Jews in Eastern Europe for years: \"I was accused of being a cold warrior,\" he remembers. \"Nobody on the left would touch it, and I didn't want to touch anyone on the right. But we prepared the ground for a large emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union.\"</p> <p>\"Of course I had links with Mossad,\" he now says - it was one way he got information for his campaign. In time, however, he began to have doubts about successive Israeli governments, and the old \"problem of identity\" reformed itself. As Wright explains, while Israel commanded Litvinoff's loyalty as \"the land of the survivors\", he always believed that the Jews could \"belong intrinsically to the dispersal\". When he visited Israel in 1966, his defence of the diaspora, and its \"yeasty\" Yiddish language, was regarded as nefarious by such writers as Moshe Shamir, in whom he heard \"the thin screech of chauvinism\". Equally controversial was his final published novel, Falls the Shadow (1983), in which an Israeli citizen is revealed as a former concentration camp guard. \"Litvinoff knew his book would be found provocative,\" says Wright, \"but he wrote it because he was worried by the way Israel was invoking the memory of the Holocaust to justify outrages of its own.\"</p> <p>Litvinoff sold the film rights to the Graham Greene-influenced The Lost Europeans; for a while his family lived prosperously in the suburbs. He became a notable contributor to the Armchair Theatre series of one-off TV plays. But, he says, he lacked ambition as a writer, and failed to publish or destroyed numerous manuscripts. He admits that the boy who failed the scholarship exam might still be in him. A shame - he is, for Valentine Cunningham, \"one of the best unsung novelists of our time\".</p> <p>But Journey Through a Small Planet will remain his most important work, becoming more necessary as the Jewish East End retreats further into myth. The book now has sufficient admirers to guarantee its survival - among them Iain Sinclair, Wright's fellow adept of the ruins and disappearances of east London, who ends his collection of essays Lights Out for the Territory with Litvinoff reminiscing \"in full flow\" at Bridewell theatre.</p> <p>\"I think it has a future,\" Litvinoff says of his memoir. \"I think that book could well be read in a hundred years' time.\" We can only hope it is.</p> <h2>Litvinoff on Litvinoff</h2> <p>from To TS Eliot </p> <p>\". . . I am not one accepted in your<br> parish.<br>Bleistein is my relative and I share<br>the protozoic slime of Shylock, a <br>page<br>in Sturmer, and, underneath the <br>cities,<br>a billet somewhat lower than the<br>rats.<br>Blood in the sewers. Pieces of our <br>flesh<br>float with the ordure on the Vistula. <br>You had a sermon but it was not this.\"</p> <p>I'd read TS Eliot's Selected Poems, which was published in 1948 and included some of the worst antisemitic poems he had written in the 20s. He's a wonderful poet, and I could forgive him for writing them at that time. But to publish them again after Auschwitz was an appalling thing for him to do. </p> <p>I went along to the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1951 with two poems. I read the first one and had just announced the title of the second, \"To TS Eliot\", when Herbert Read said: \"Oh good, Tom has just come in.\" I felt dreadful about reading my poem. But I thought to myself, it has a right to be read, and I read it with a trembling voice that gave it an extraordinary power. </p> <p>When I had finished, there was a shocked silence. Then hell broke loose and I remember Stephen Spender getting up and saying: \"As a poet as Jewish as Litvinoff, I'm outraged by this unwanted, undeserved attack on my friend TS Eliot\" and so on. Apparently, Eliot, who had his head down resting on a chair, was heard to mutter: \"It's a good poem. It's a very good poem.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To find out more about the life and works of Emanuel Litvinoff, visit <a href=\"http://www.emanuel-litvinoff.com\">emanuel-litvinoff.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A Frankenstein-like irony attends writers and books overtaken by the events they describe. In 1805, in the Prussian town of Jena, the philosopher Hegel was racing to finish The Phenomenology of Spirit with a draconian publishing contract hanging over his head. The Spirit hypothesised by Hegel was exemplified by Napoleon - a \"world soul\" whose armies were sweeping across Europe. But the emperor's arrival with his army, his victory at the battle of Jena and his occupation of the university town were more \"world\" than the philosopher needed. He promptly decamped to Bamberg to edit a small newspaper, and The Phenomenology was published (late) to minimal applause.</p> <p>Hegel's example might have warned Chris Cleave what can happen to books when their stories escape the covers. In late June 2005, I reviewed Cleave's first novel, Incendiary, which took the form of a book-length \"letter\" from a working-class woman (brilliantly ventriloquised by Cleave) to Osama bin Laden after the suicide bombing of Arsenal football stadium, in which her husband and son have perished. The book's official publication date was July 7. That, of course, was the date chosen by a group of Islamic suicide bombers to blow up three tube trains and a bus in London, killing more than 50 people.</p> <p>The 7/7 attacks dwarfed the mere publication of a book. At the end of the year, the publisher, which had hoped with justification for great things, cited the coincidence as the cause of the book's relative lack of success. Incendiary got lost in the smoke that billowed prophetically from its pages: too much \"world\". After that bruising encounter with the news, one might have expected Cleave to draw in his horns, shy away from the engag\u00e9 or otherwise take the road to Bamberg. One would be wrong.</p> <p>The Other Hand is an ambitious and fearless gallop from the jungles of Africa via a shocking encounter on a Nigerian beach to the media offices of London and domesticity in leafy suburbia. Part-thriller, part-multicultural Aga saga, the book enmeshes its characters in the issues of immigration, globalisation, political violence and personal accountability. Lists of themes are often review-speak for \"worthy but dull\", but not in this case. Cleave immerses the reader in the worlds of his characters with an unshakable confidence that we will find them as gripping and vital as he does. Mostly, that confidence is justified.</p> <p>The book begins in an immigration detention centre where Little Bee, a 16-year-old Ibo girl from Nigeria, has spent the last two years honing skills that point back to horrific past events and forward to a hoped-for future. Making herself look unattractive to men is the first of several mysterious threads that Cleave slowly winds in. Learning the Queen's English (from the quality broadsheets only, she specifies) has a more obvious relevance. \"Excuse me for learning your language properly. I am here to tell you a real story. I did not come here to talk to you about the bright African colours.\" </p> <p>The colours, when they come - on a beach in Nigeria - are certainly not bright. The route back to them begins with Little Bee's inadvertent escape from the centre with three women, variously cheerful, bewildered and suicidal, and a phone call to a columnist and journalist, Andrew O'Rourke. Little Bee encountered Andrew and his wife Sarah in Nigeria. Now he is dismayed to hear from her.</p> <p>From this small mystery, the rest of Little Bee's story begins to unfold. Something has happened that has not only left its mark on a teenage Ibo girl but has shaken the O'Rourke family to its foundations. Ensconced in Kingston-upon-Thames, Andrew suffers from depression. Sarah, who edits a women's magazine called Nixie, pursues an unhappy affair. Their young son Charlie dresses and lives as Batman. Their story is narrated by Sarah - necessarily so, because in the time between Little Bee's telephone call and her arrival in Kingston, Andrew commits suicide. </p> <p>\"It started on the day we first met Little Bee, on a lonely beach in Nigeria. The only souvenir I have of that first meeting is an absence where the middle finger of my left hand used to be. The amputation is quite clean. In place of my finger is a stump, a phantom digit that used to be responsible for the E, D and C keys on my laptop.\"</p> <p>The \"it\" is teasingly unspecified, and the term \"amputation\" is not quite honest, as it turns out, but Cleave's unobtrusive skill in sentences like that allows the world of the machete to be glimpsed through the world of the laptop. Most of the action has already happened when Little Bee and Sarah reunite. Through their recollections, an African past surfaces slowly in an English present. Cleave doles out clues and hints. Then, within a perfectly paced flashback, he has Little Bee tell how she first met the O'Rourkes in Nigeria, and what happened on the beach.</p> <p>A special place in hell is reserved for the taxi-drivers who shout the name of the murderer outside Les Mis\u00e9rables to under-tipping passengers. Right next door to them sit the reviewers who give away the surprises in books. Cleave showed in Incendiary that he was equal to the challenges of a large-scale violent setpiece scene. This one is more compressed, more intense and more chilling. I never thought I would read the phrase \"rang like a bell\" with anything but a yawn. But I shuddered.</p> <p>The book's kernel of violence throws up a stark choice and drives a wedge between Sarah and Andrew O'Rourke. The different choices each makes on the beach together drive the action and raise a larger question. Whose experience should we accept as authentic? Is The Other Hand a book about what happens in Africa (to Little Bee), or what people in Kingston-upon-Thames (such as Sarah) think about what happens in Africa?</p> <p>Like the unnamed heroine of Incendiary, Sarah O'Rourke is a far from perfect heroine: a semi-neglectful mother and unfaithful wife (the trip to Nigeria was an ill-conceived marriage-saving exercise). Cleave has some fun at her expense. Here she recalls getting ready to go to work the last time she saw her husband alive. \"I always dressed up for deadline days. Heels, skirt, smart green jacket. Magazine publishing has its rhythms, and if the editor won't dance to them, she can't expect her staff to. I don't float feature ideas in Fendi heels, and I don't close an issue in Pumas.\"</p> <p>Magazine publishing, middle-aged affairs, nurseries and funerals all come in for this kind of satirical close observation. But Cleave does not mock Sarah (and life in Kingston-upon-Thames) any more than he does Little Bee and her experiences in Nigeria. Life in England may appear superficial compared to a life-and-death struggle for existence in the tropical forests east of the Niger. Little Bee, however, has voted with her feet. One can have too much authenticity. Too much world. </p> <p>Cleave makes no judgment on these two existences and, more interestingly, he eschews the postmodern back-pedal into irony. The Other Hand is emphatically not ironic. For all the characters' faults, none of them is presented as inauthentic or standing for something that we are intended to disbelieve. There are no straw targets. Nothing in the novel is included only to be derided. As a consequence, the story of Little Bee, Sarah and Charlie/Batman becomes heated to the point of melodrama. A thoughtless act on Sarah's part delivers Little Bee into the clutches of immigration officials. To right that wrong, she pursues a course of action that is not quite credible; but by this stage, the tremendous momentum of the story carries the reader through. </p> <p>There are no nods or winks to the reader. Cleave follows his story to a powerful and emotive end. If The Other Hand flirts with melodrama, that is a fault Cleave shares with Dickens, and for the same reason. He means it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lawrence Norfolk's novels include In the Shape of a Boar (Weidenfeld)</p>",

  "<p>Civil engineers work in a fast-moving, challenging and rewarding profession, involving design, construction and management. You could be involved in seeing through a project from design stage to construction and competition. These projects might include the development and construction of bridges, tunnels, roads, railways, dams and major buildings. There is also the chance to work overseas and starting salaries have increased at double the rate of inflation over the last five years, as many sectors of civil engineering experience skills shortages.

In terms of personal attributes, we look for graduates who are self-motivated and have good communication skills. The latter is critical as our business is a consultancy and you need to articulate and engage with customers and colleagues. Team working and the ability to co-operate with a variety of individuals in a multidisciplinary team is also something that we look for. We find out at the point of recruitment what area of business our graduates are interested in. </p> <p>Every graduate civil engineer who joins us will follow our accredited professional development scheme with the aim of becoming chartered. This involves continuous professional development, but we also provide a comprehensive portfolio of training to further enhance their knowledge, skills and outlook, which looks at the softer skills such as communication and judgment. </p> <p>In our firm, once you have your chartership, then it's down to you which route you want to take. We have three career routes: a project route, technical route or business route. </p> <p>The types of projects graduates could be working on might include flood defence work for the Environment Agency, cycle way improvements for local authorities and motorway widening for the Highways Agency.

We're looking for people with enthusiasm and a real interest in civil engineering, not people who want to use an engineering degree as a stepping stone for working in the City. </p> <p>For both our four-year MEng and three-year BEng in civil engineering, we offer an optional industrial placement for a year. We encourage people to get work experience, as those students on placements can put their learning into context and are much more enthusiastic when they come back to the course. </p> <p>We have got the following core modules in our courses: structures, maths, material science, geotechnics, building environment and hydraulics. Alongside that, students will work on a series of design projects which help them apply what they have been learning in lectures. In the final-year project, engineers and architectural students work together on a large project.

Maybe, but we need to get our priorities right. <br><strong>Richard Cooper</strong><br>Southampton</p> <h2>It's not only families that are hard working</h2> <p>Just a note to say thanks to The Reporter column for the comment at the end of \"You read it here first\" (Money Guardian, August 2). I'm a moderator on a website for child-free people and one of our bugbears is the media emphasis on \"hard-working families\", to the seeming exclusion of singles and couples without children.</p> <p>It's not only the Daily Mail - the government is probably the worst offender. The BBC are often guilty too, but did say they'd consider a change of policy when we contacted them.<br><strong>Gwennan Thomas</strong><br>Via email</p> <h2>Size matters, but not at that price, Royal Mail</h2> <p>Further to recent letters concerning excess charges levied by Royal Mail for incorrect postage, I contacted them to ask for one of their cardboard size guides. By obtaining one of these, I hoped to avoid mail being disrupted and recipients being inconvenienced by incorrect postage.</p> <p>Lo and behold, Royal Mail no longer supplies the free cardboard size guides but they helpfully supplied me with details of a company that makes plastic versions. This is essentially a piece of plastic with a couple of slots in it. The price is \u00a325 plus VAT. I have subsequently written to Royal Mail to let them know where they can gently place their plastic size guide.<br><strong>Alan Payling</strong><br>Torquay</p> <h2>Railing at penalty fare system on trains</h2> <p>I recently booked an advance Norwich to London ticket with my senior railcard. On the day of the journey I forgot my railcard, but did have the ticket with me. I was issued with a penalty fare of \u00a346.50, making \u00a353.50 including the ticket I had bought.</p> <p>I wrote to the rail companies' appeal office enclosing copies of my railcard and ticket, proving both were valid. The appeal was dismissed.</p> <p>Surely the rail companies' actions in imposing what amounts to an on-the-spot fine for an oversight is completely unfair and against all natural justice. After all, a motorist who is asked to show a driving licence is asked to produce it at a police station within a given period, not given a spot fine because he or she does not have it with them.</p> <p>I am left with the impression the rail companies' only interest is to make as much money as they can. <br><strong>Chris Chapman</strong><br>Via email</p> <h2>Selective bailouts unfair to rest of us</h2> <p>So now the government is ploughing millions into Northern Rock, while an ombudsman has decided people who have put their money with Equitable Life also need to be compensated.</p> <p>I haven't heard anything about people like myself - who have a life insurance policy which is looking bleaker and bleaker - being compensated. After facing a huge deficit with my insurance policy, to rub salt into the wounds I now need to provide funds through further tax demands (which surely the government will impose on us), to bail out Northern Rock and EL investors.</p> <p>Am I missing something or are only certain types of savings protected?<br><strong>Martin Lawrence</strong><br>South Croydon</p> <h2>Driven mad by car insurance settlement</h2> <p>With reference to \"Moving the goalposts over a fixed penalty\" (August 2), in January my car was stolen from outside my house. The thieves were apprehended red-handed, with the car, by the police and it was impounded. I never used it again. Having done their forensic examination, the police handed the car over to another garage for examination by my insurers, Lloyds TSB. A loss adjuster told me the car could not be repaired and offered me \u00a3800, about two-thirds of its book value. The claim went back to be handled in Ipswich. The claims office requested I provide photocopies of my licence, log book, MOT, etc, and also of my wife's licence because she was nominated as a second driver.</p> <p>My wife had driven my car once, last century. Having her as second driver was a contingency in case I became ill. However, in 2004, about a year before the commencement of my policy with Lloyds TSB, my wife incurred a speeding fine while driving her own car. As soon as the office handling my claim received the information about my wife's speeding offence, their attitude became adversarial. I had failed to disclose my wife's speeding offence. Having deducted, understandably, the excess of \u00a3100, they requested backdated premiums for each of the three previous years of my insurance with Lloyds TSB, with an administration charge of \u00a315 for each year, which amounted to about \u00a3180. At one point they threatened to not honour my claim at all.</p> <p>Eventually, they agreed to waive the administration charges, so the extra cost was reduced by \u00a345. </p> <p>Because I have better things to do than spend even more time following this up - writing letters, telephoning, complaining to my local branch of Lloyds TSB - I accepted about \u00a3550. I was able to buy myself a pushbike. I am left with a belief that I was the victim of stealing from two directions. </p> <p>The sad druggies who drove off in my stole from me and so, in my view, did Lloyds TSB which, with much more calculation and sophistication, knew how to beat down a claim to incur as little loss as possible and protect profits. <br><strong>David JK Evans</strong><br>Via email</p> <h2>Footing the bill for meter mistakes</h2> <p>I am 85, live alone and use only electricity. Years ago I chose Southern Electric's \"superdeal\". It has sent me an \"accurate\" set of estimated charges for April to July of this year, which is higher than the bill I got for January to April. Since I had long turned off the heating, it was obviously wrong. After complaining, I have now received a bill for less than half that amount. </p> <p>If I had paid the original bill, Southern Electric would now be collecting interest on the overpayment until such time as the account was in balance again - three months away at least. </p> <p>I have old bills to show this has happened regularly to me. Multiplied across the country this would be a nice little earner for the company. </p> <p>Another little earner occurred with a price rise between bills. The company underestimated the units used at the old rate and overestimated those at the new one. When I complained, they corrected it. </p> <p>I can do without all this bother but I daren't go on direct debit. I pay extra for not doing so - and the company gains once more.<br><strong>W Davis, Cowes</strong><br>Isle of Wight</p> <h2>Lords ruling on housing benefit</h2> <p>Congratulations for highlighting a serious problem, \"Failing to feel the housing benefit\" (August 2), and the payable levels being determined by the Rent Service (RS), an executive agency of the Department for Work and Pensions. However, the unfairness caused by this arrangement is not new, it having been a feature of the old housing benefit regime. Indeed, the House of Lords ruled on the preceding Wednesday that the manner in which the RS is applying the definition of locality, the principal cause of the unfairness, is unlawful (Heffernan v the Rent Service [2008] UKHL 58). </p> <p>Whilst the case concerned the old regime, its guidance applies to the new one and should stop the RS using areas as large and diffuse as the \"whole of Sheffield and its rural hinterland\" as the \"broad rental market area\" - the equivalent of \"locality\" under the new legislation - when making its determinations, and should work against the creation of welfare benefit ghettos in our cities by allowing recipients more choice about where they live. <br><strong>Jamie Burton</strong><br>Counsel for Mr Heffernan, Doughty Street Chambers, London</p>",

Previous productions have taken place in a tent, a former car-repair workshop, a bank and a disused ice rink, and for the latest show - a version of Mozart's great opera seria which has been renamed King Idomeneo - Vick and his designer Stuart Nunn have transformed a former rubber factory not far from Birmingham city centre.

  "<p>Andrei Arshavin has revealed he wanted to join Tottenham Hotspur after the club's manager Juande Ramos called him personally and the continuing impasse over his proposed transfer had left him frustrated and praying for a \"miracle\". </p> <p>The Zenit St Petersburg playmaker also said that he had met a representative from Spurs to agree personal terms and lamented the club hiking his price to more than \u00a320m to \"frighten off\" his suitors. </p> <p>Arshavin wanted to insert a buy-out clause into his last contract at Zenit but the administration, who have since departed, said that it was not necessary as he had their word that he could leave if a serious offer were to come in. That gentleman's agreement, though, has cut no ice with the new president, Alexander Dukov. </p> <p>Even the Zenit fans, who appreciate what Arshavin has done for them, have given their blessing to his transfer, holding up banners at recent matches urging Dukov to \"Let Shava Go\". Arshavin has even considered the last resort of going on strike; he will decide today whether to fly to Kazan for tomorrow's showdown with the league leaders Rubin. </p> <p>\"When Tottenham made their offer, I was sceptical at first,\" said Arshavin. \"But after Ramos called me personally and told me that they were selling Robbie Keane and that he wanted me in his side, the situation changed.

  "<p>Ben Whitford's attack on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/01/immigrationpolicy.usa\">the American Immigration Control Foundation's advertising campaign</a>, dealing with population growth, is a masterpiece of illogic and error.</p> <p>We point out that population growth puts stress on the environment and that immigration now accounts for 83% of US population growth. Whitford replies, citing crackpot Julian Simon, that \"immigration-fuelled population increases will make little or no longterm difference to the US environment.\" Simon is the man who claimed that our planet could sustain slow population growth for the next seven million years. Mathematician Albert Bartlett did the math and found that slow growth (1% per year) for just 17,000 years would yield more people than atoms in the entire universe. Overcrowding anyone?</p> <p>Later, Whitford switches direction and concedes that \"environmentalists can't ignore population growth\". Then, substituting clich\u00e9-think for analysis, he claims population is \"a global problem that demands global solutions.\" Not so. The globe is too big for anyone to handle, but breaking problems down to the national level allows effective decision-making and accountability. Countries that overpopulate will keep on doing so if they think they can keep sending their excess people elsewhere. They will have no incentive to change their ways until the receiving countries close this avenue.<br> Whitford's final ploy is to suggest that immigration will reduce birth rates, ie, people will have fewer children when they move to richer countries. The facts, however, suggest otherwise. As noted by the Public Policy Institute in California, the fertility rate of Mexican immigrants in the US does not go down, and in subsequent generations it increases. Short on logic and fact, Whitford is long on ad hominem. He cites neo-Nazis who believe that immigration is a population problem and implies all who share this view are neo-Nazis. Yes, and from this insight we also may deduce that if neo-Nazis eat breakfast, then all who eat breakfast are neo-Nazis too.</p>",

  "<p>\"Often I've been compared to Mozart,\" jokes the Dutch comic Hans Teeuwen. And why not? After all, he is one of the few comedians now working to whom the word genius might be applied, if only because no other terms seem any more, or less, suitable. Watching his shows is unlike any other standup experience: one minute you are hysterical, the next, you want to hide behind your chair.</p> <p>Having forsworn comedy in his native Holland, Teeuwen now trades over there as a lounge singer. His standup is likewise a form of music, albeit atonal, arrhythmic music, whose conductor is forever subverting the tempo. Or shoving his baton up your arse. The effect is duly unsettling, as Teeuwen gallivants several steps ahead of, or behind, our expectations. Crowd-pleasing isn't in his lexicon. The last thing you expect to come next, probably will - even if that means something not remotely funny at all.</p> <p>Teeuwen is making his solo Edinburgh debut, after last year's fire-cracker 20-minute slot, and an intervening West End stint. Die-hards will recognise material from previous shows, notably his gloriously interminable talking-rabbit skit (\"I'll never forget this image of my father trying to teach his new rabbit how to speak ...\") and the bongo-drum nonsense-song, Nostradamus, that has become his anthem.</p> <p>Again, we meet the sock-puppet that mauls a Mars bar while Teeuwen sings the Moody Blues \u2014 this time preceded by a daft sequence in which the comic fails to synchronise his voice with his own yapping hand. Then there is the wordless sight of a child licking his ice-cream, which Teeuwen defies us not to reinterpret as something altogether more adult. Sex, and sexual aggression, course under and into his act as if from a leaky sewer. But there is no emotional intimacy. The show is not about the real Hans Teeuwen, whoever that might be; and if there is any personal revelation, it is that of a comedian possessed by the devil.</p> <p>Sometimes, Teeuwen seems to be failing - but there is always the suspicion that that is intentional. After all, he is happy to turn away from our laughter to play a wholly uncomical waltz on the piano, or recite a tender love poem to a woman in the front row. That is not funny per se, but it stokes the atmosphere of dizzy uncertainty, which it is very funny to be part of. More puerile than Mozart, then - but like old Wolfgang, and like another horny beast, Teeuwen has all the best tunes.</p>",
  "<p>On the eighth hour of the evening of the eighth day of the month of the eighth year of the millennium, the lucky numbers all fell into place for China - like a game of mah-jong you cannot lose.</p> <p>This opening of the 29th Olympic Games was an orchestrated marriage of superstition and military precision on a scale only a one-party state could deliver with such confidence. It was a show not so much riveting because of its artistic merit (which was considerable) but the self-conscious reaching for grandeur that has become the Olympic movement's parodic symbol of excess.</p> <p>Yes, it was bigger and better than Athens - which matched Sydney, which left Atlanta in a cocked hat, which was miserably worse than Barcelona, and so on back to the first of these beautiful monsters, Moscow in 1980.</p> <p>At the birthplace of fireworks, we might have been watching New Year's Eve from under Sydney Harbour Bridge. There seemed little difference, either, between this and a West End show - apart from the scale of the production. The costumery, borrowing from traditions that are caricatures of the cultures they represent, might have been delivered by Hollywood.</p> <p>''One world, one dream,'' they say. Yes, but only in the imagination of marketing men.</p> <p>The question that is as eternal as the flame which has been carried in troubled progress around the world from Athens since March is: what next? If the wise men of the International Olympic Committee ever award the Games to the moon, or maybe Mars, perhaps then the pyrotechnics will be of such unimaginable brilliance, we will say, ''Okay, that's enough.''</p> <p>Given the Chinese placed such store in the timing of the start, to chime with their belief in the luck of the number eight, let me run some other digits past you.</p> <p><strong>3 billion</strong> People watching around the world.<br><strong>204</strong> Flag bearers.<br><strong>1</strong> Flag bearers making a political statement. <br><strong>90</strong> 'International dignitaries'.<br><strong>30</strong> Wheelchairs for spectators.<br><strong>9,000</strong> Members of the People's Liberation Army hitting golden drum caskets on the stadium floor.<br><strong>1</strong> Number of seconds before the first collective 'oooooh!'<br><strong>4</strong> Hours the show lasted.<br><strong>2,488</strong> Volunteers in the stadium.<br><strong>91,000</strong> Other people in the stadium.<br><strong>26</strong> Waiting ambulances.<br><strong>62.5</strong> The claimed percentage of the humidity.<br><strong>2</strong> The number of eyeballs I've got that I swear were sweating.</p> <p>They go with other sums of staggering proportions: the $40bn (\u00a320bn) China has spent putting this extravaganza together over the next couple of weeks, for instance - and zero, the number of protesters they would countenance ruining the drama because of serious concern over the country's human rights record.</p> <p>Here, as ever, we were asked to leave our cynicism at the gate - which was a good half mile from where we sat, overflown by armed helicopters and spy planes, girded by thousands of guards and barbed wire, shrouded in a haze we were informed was not polluted, just impenetrable.</p> <p>And, unrelentingly, inside the Bird's Nest - such a long way removed from reality - our senses were assaulted with one spectacular after another. Zhang Yimou, the artistic director, can die a fulfilled and happy man. He represented his country's rich culture with \u00e9lan: a delicate, refined tableaux that combined the calligraphy of the language's subtle brush strokes with the hauntingly melancholy melodies of the pipa, the pear-shaped instrument played with unerring precision by a hundred of the prettiest girls they could find.</p> <p>There were rolling oars, gilded pillars, a bewildering parade of costumes that seemed to represent nothing in particular but their symmetry and brightness, like a lovely bowl of mixed fruit. Colours flickered and flashed, as did cameras and every other gadget capable of recording the event.</p> <p>Artists and dancers who have rehearsed their moves for 13 months scurried this way and that across the surface that would later see the more muscular endeavours of dedicated athletes, some of them from countries barely the size of Beijing, others so monumentally powerful they arrived with all the menace of invading armies.</p> <p>Then, when the music died, when the smoke drifted from the stadium, to meld with the gunge-carrying clouds above, they called for the athletes, the real players, the men and women for whom this was not at all frivolous.</p> <p>And there to disturb the party was one brave and grateful man, carrying the flag in front of his team-mates in the United States team, China's fiercest foe. He is Lopez Lomong, a runner - but a runner like few others at these Olympics.</p> <p>Lomong started running in 1991, when he was six years old. Running, with his family from the machetes and guns of the Janjaweed, the rebel militia who terrorised the Sudanese village of Kumontong, and still do today.</p> <p>For three days Lomong, his parents and his two small brothers ran in blind terror through the bush. In the confusion, they were separated and Lopez found himself at the Kenya border. Catholic missionaries took him in at a refugee camp. For ten years, the camp was his home. Charity workers visited the camp in 2001 and helped Lopez move to a new life in the United States. He was adopted by a family in upstate New York: white, middle-class patriots. He was among 3,800 orphans and bewildered young children saved by a programme known as the Lost Boys of Sudan. Last year, he became an American citizen, and the legs that carried him to freedom 17 years ago proved strong and fast enough to make him into a world-class athlete.</p> <p>Last night, with the world watching, Lomong was happy to repay the kindness when he led the American team in a gesture every bit as laden with symbolism as the Black Power salute of the American sprinters in Mexico in 1968. Lomong was the overwhelming choice of his team-mates, because he was the athlete best qualified to send a message to China that their inability or unwillingness to intervene meaningfully in the slaughter of 400,000 Sudanese was plainly unacceptable.</p> <p>The Americans were determined to be the last to kowtow to the inevitability of the hosts' ambitions of finishing not just at the top of the medals table at these Olympics but at the summit of world trade and economic hegemony.</p> <p>George W Bush, whose credibility as a world leader is compromised by the diminishing length of his tenure, said the other day, \"All people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose.\"</p> <p>The man whom protocol demanded had to shake the American president's hand, China's leader, President Hu Jintao, was displeased with Mr Bush, but he smiled nonetheless, along with 57 other leaders from around the world. All were happy to embrace the Olympic spirit, all of them playing the greatest game of all.</p> <p>It's better than war. Though probably not much cheaper.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds and possibly thousands of volunteer fighters from Russia were mobilising to enter the war in Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia republic tonight.</p> <p>Units of armed Cossacks from across the North Caucasus region that borders Georgia were poised to join the battle for the separatists' capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>In North Ossetia, the region of Russia which shares cultural links and a border with South Ossetia, lists of men willing to cross the border and fight against Georgian forces were drawn up. Vitaly Khubayev, 35, a resident of the capital Vladikavkaz, told the Guardian: \"There are already two busloads of fighters leaving for Tskhinvali every day.</p> <p>\"They give you a uniform on the way and then you get issued with weapons once you arrive. If I didn't have three children I'd have gone myself.\"</p> <p>The two Ossetian republics are historically inseparable and residents of the northern republic were furious at what they described as the \"Georgian fascist attack\" on their neighbours.</p> <p>Many said they were willing to take up arms and travel to defend their relatives across the border in South Ossetia. Valentin Tekhti, 67, a teacher, said: \"Our Ossetian brothers are dying. If we get the call every man who can stand on two legs will go to fight.\" </p> <p>Amiran Khubetsov, a doctor, said: \"A whole nation is under bombardment in the land it has occupied for hundreds of years. The world must not ignore this aggression.\"</p> <p>At a special meeting of the United Nations Security Council this morning, the US called on the Kremlin to prevent irregulars entering South Ossetia via the 4km Roki tunnel, the republic's only link with Russia.</p> <p>But meeting with US president George Bush in Bejing later in the day Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin admitted that \"many volunteers\" were heading to South Ossetia and it would be \"very hard to maintain peace\".</p> <p>Cossack leaders across southern Russia said they were forming volunteer units to join the fight against Georgia.</p> <p>Under Russia law, Cossacks \u2013 the descendants of runaway serfs and outlaws who in the past were employed by the Kremlin to protect the country's southern border \u2013 are allowed to carry arms and carry out policing functions in cooperation with interior ministry forces.</p> <p>At the Vladikavkaz headquarters of the Terek Cossacks today a group of men sat under portraits of fierce looking warriors with drooping moustaches watching television coverage of Georgian artillery shelling Tskhinvali. One man said there would be an extraordinary meeting today to discuss forming volunteer units.</p> <p>In Volgograd the leader of the Don Cossacks, Viktor Vodolatsky called on all Cossacks under 40 years of age to volunteer to fight. Reports said 100 men from the region had already left for South Ossetia.</p> <p>In the centre of Vladikavkaz there were emotional scenes as hundreds of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the regional government headquarters. They shouted, \"Russia, save us!\"</p> <p>Aelita Dzhioyeva, 41, a lawyer who fled Tskhinvali last night, showed text messages on her mobile phone from relatives still sheltering in a basement in the city. One message read: \"We are dying. Ask the government for help.\"</p> <p>Mrs Dzhioyeva said: \"Our men will stay and fight until the last drop of blood but our old people and children must be saved. We are calling on the Kremlin to intervene and create a humanitarian corridor for them to escape.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Get ready for the big show</strong></p> <p>At 8.03pm (1.03pm BST) precisely, a blitzkrieg of fireworks will be pumped into the Beijing night sky. First at Yongdingmen South, then Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, before rattling north along the Beijing meridian, creating \u2013 silver iodide shells permitting - either a fiery snake-like effect above the night sky or an even greater smog cloud. Five minutes later, the firework procession will end at the Bird's Nest stadium and the opening ceremony will begin.</p> <p>Providing an errant firework doesn't take out her larynx, Britain will be represented by Sarah Brightman, who will perform the games' theme song with Chinese popstar Liu Huan. By 9am this morning the crowds were swarming around the stadium, even though most didn't have tickets. There must have been almost 20,000 on the walkway last night, with whole families turning up to photograph themselves by the Bird's Nest. If anything there were even more this morning, many wearing red pro-China headbands. So far, however, there are no signs of the excessive nationalism of Berlin 1936 or, heaven forbid, Atlanta 1996. But these Games are still in their embryonic stage.</p> <p>The other big issue remains the quality of Beijing's air, which was down to 80 on the pollution scale today, from 96 yesterday (anything over 100 is pretty bad, while over 300 is prepare-your-will time). Organisers are also continuing to stress their 'Green Olympics concept'. Yesterday they even promised that tonight's fireworks will use \"less smoking powder to minimise smoke and dust pollution\" \u2013 which might just negate the coaches outside the stadium with their engines permanently turned on.</p> <p>Meanwhile the shadowboxing between China and the US has begun in earnest. The Americans have been downplaying their chances, with one official insisting: \"I know their resources and I know what they intend to do, and we clearly expect them to become the dominant Olympic team for years to come. We're not used to being underdog, but we'll get used to this and do our best\" \u2013 which is hardly the boisterous U-S-A! U-S-A! tone of Athens. Still, picking the Sudanese-born Lopez Lomong to carry their flag is an interesting attempt to get under China's skin. The reaction he gets from the crowd tonight may yet determine the tone between the two countries for the rest of the games.</p> <p><strong>Bei-watch</strong></p> <p>Tom Daley may be only 14 but he's already a sponsor's dream. During the GB diving press conference he scattered plugs like confetti. \"My family booked their trip last year through Sport-Travel\", he began, \"and thanks to Team Visa I managed to meet up with Steve Redgrave.\" Later he added: \"Our rooms have been very nicely kitted out by B&amp;Q.\" The kid is going to print a lot of marketers' meal tickets.</p> <p>But while he's pretty switched on in some areas, Daley still has some learning to do. He said how pleased he'd been when Jamie Murray had wandered over to talk to him at breakfast today, but looked a little puzzled at the throaty chuckle that went up when he added that he'd been sat with Tonia Couch, the rather attractive young blonde competing in the individual women's platform.</p> <p>Some elements of the media have been moaning about the smog and excessive bureaucracy in Beijing. But there have been no such criticisms of the media centre, which has a swanky gym, a hairdressers and free massages \u2013 and, between 10-11am and 4-5pm, free fruit, cake and drinks.</p> <p>Since antiquity the number six, representing smoothness, stability and luck, has been considered the luckiest in China. No more. Now it's eight \u2013 the symbol of prosperity and getting rich quick. Some put this switch down to Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms, others to the birth of Princess Eugenie on 8/8/88. Either way the Chinese believe in this hooey: last year, 3,390 couples were married on August 8 in Beijing. Today, with three eights in the date it will be 16,400. And the Olympics will also be starting at 8.08pm too.</p> <p>China Daily, China's main English-language newspaper/Communist party mouthpiece (think Pravda with a state-of-the-art DTP system) has spent all week spinning like Alastair Campbell on a cycling turbo (sample headline \u2013 'IOC: Air Is Safe For One And All' on a day the smog above the city didn't clear all day.) You'd expect that. But a column claiming that China's policy in Africa, including Sudan, is based on 'reciprocity, mutual benefit and joint development' and 'totally different from the brutal and bloody ways the Western colonists plundered African resources' was surely pushing the party line a little too far?</p> <p>On this day of all days, we citizens of the world should focus on what unites us rather than divides us. <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/05/content_8961139.htm\">Congratulations to this guy, then,</a> who proves that \"claiming to see stuff in inanimate objects for the purpose of getting oneself featured in the news media\" is not merely the preserve of the degenerate west. Of course, this early-stage capitalist has yet to realise the eBayability of his ugly little rock - but once Mao's face has been spotted on a few more pieces of toast, this will swiftly change, as China's rampant faux-ly relic economy leaves the rest of the world trailing.</p> <p><strong>Coming up this weekend</strong></p> <p>SATURDAY</p> <p><strong>Shooting:</strong> The first gold medal will be awarded to the winner of the women's 10m air rifle at approximately 2.45am BST.

In the absence of Frankie Gavin, Bradley is considered one of the team's better medal hopes.</p> <p><strong>Basketball:</strong> Yao Ming leads China in what ought to be mission impossible against the Kobe Bryant-inspired US.

  "<p>MIA wants everyone to know, once and for all, that she is not a terrorist.<br> The British musician has become an unlikely star this summer. She cancelled her tours, her album is over a year old, and other than getting engaged there's not much new in her life. But in the United States, everyone's buzzing about MIA. The attention comes thanks to Pineapple Express, a new comedy by the makers of Superbad and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. MIA's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sei-eEjy4g\">Paper Planes</a> blasts over the film's TV and radio spots, sending a million Americans to iTunes in search of \"that song with the gunshots\". And all of a sudden, Paper Planes \u2013 which was for many the summer jam of 2007 - has become the summer jam of 2008.</p> <p>Not everyone's happy about this.</p> <p>\"MIA, you represent terrorism in the worst way,\" insists DeLon, a Sri Lankan rapper who has loosed an <a href=\"http://www.ceylonrecords.com/\">online video diss</a>. \"For all you people who really think that MIA is a freedom fighter \u2013 let me give you some facts ... All she wanna do is [gunshots] straight to my head!\"</p> <p>Over Paper Planes' looped and Clash-sampling riff, DeLon lays into MIA for a perceived support of Sri Lankan terrorism. He argues that her use of tiger iconography isn't just a reference to the terrorist Tamil Tiger group, but an endorsement of them \u2013 and a celebration of the violent organisation that her father, Arul Pragasam, was once involved with.</p> <p>MIA's not having any of it. She laid into DeLon in an official statement, accusing the upstart of making a cheap play for publicity. \"I don't support terrorism and never have,\" she wrote. \"As a Sri Lankan that fled war and bombings, my music is the voice of the civilian refugee. Frankly, I am not trying to start dialogue with someone who is really just seeking self-promotion.\"</p> <p>However, the DeLon self-promotion train continues full steam ahead. Boasting of a \"new Revolution in hip-hop\" that promotes \"peace and unity in Sri Lanka\", the rapper has also said that he is suing Universal, MIA's parent label. He claims they removed his diss track from YouTube. </p> <p>Maybe someone should remind DeLon that MIA's original Paper Planes lyrics say that she'll \"(cash register sound) take your money!\"</p>",
  "<h2>1. Cala d'en Serra, Ibiza</h2> <p>Ibiza's most famous beach is the long, white-sand crescent of Salinas, dotted with hip bars and beautiful people. However, it's the island's remote, peaceful coves that are far more prized by locals. Many of these require a long walk down a precipitous cliff path to reach nothing but rocks, dropping straight into the water. Cala d'en Serra is one that gives you the best of both worlds \u2013 a tranquil, secluded bay with its very own sandy beach. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336336429\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/Ibiza.jpg\" alt=\"Cala d\u0092en Serra, Ibiza\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Massimo Ripani/Grand Tour/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Massimo Ripani/Grand Tour/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the far north-eastern corner of Ibiza, not far from the family-friendly resort of Portinatx, you come to Cala d'en Serra by driving down a steep rocky road, which eventually becomes impassable, forcing you to park and walk. Soon, through the needles of the pine trees, you start to catch enticing glimpses of the cove itself - a perfect horseshoe of clear-blue water, backed by steep rocky cliffs that make it feel cut off from the rest of the world. There's one beach cafe, run by a German couple. Make sure you have a snorkel (there's abundant sealife too), then retire to one of the tables set within the rambling pines, order some rose and freshly grilled fish, and toast the perfect day by the sea. <br><strong>Tom Robbins</strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at:</strong> Can Marti, an agroturismo on a working organic farm that produces its own electricity using solar panels.

The Curonian Spit, Lithuania</h2> <p>A narrow finger of land poking into the Baltic Sea, the 98km-long <a href=\"http://www.nerija.lt/en/foto/kopos.php\">Curonian Spit</a> is one of Europe's more unlikely beach destinations. Reached by a 10-minute ferry crossing from the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda, this peninsula of shifting dunes and pine forests, where wolves and moose roam, is largely undiscovered by foreign tourists. Hire a bike from the fishing village of Nida and set off around the coast in search of your own perfect stretch of golden sand. In summer, the sea is millpond calm and warm enough to swim in, with the sun still high in the sky at 9pm. If you tire of the beach, you can shop for amber jewellery in Nida or join the locals for a long lunch of chilled beetroot soup, grilled eel or herring, and dumplings with sour cream (all for under \u00a36).<br> <strong>Joanne O'Connor</strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at:</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.kursmariuvila.lt/en/vietaEN.php\"> Kursmariu Vila</a> in the village of Preila.

Things have chilled out a little since then. In fact, Canos de Meca has become a well-known hippy hangout on Spain's wind-whipped Costa de la Luz. The beachfront is wonderfully underdeveloped, save for the dreamlike La Jaima, a giant tented structure that cascades from the road down to the sand. Inside, you'll find a superb oriental restaurant and killer mojitos, and, when the mood grabs the locals, impromptu parties that spill out on to the beach. <br><strong>Benji Lanyado</strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at:</strong> Los Castillejos, which has bungalows sleeping two from \u20ac50pn. <a href=\"http://www.loscastillejos.com\">loscastillejos.com</a>.</p> <h2>4. Barleycove, County Cork, Ireland</h2> <p>Sun-worshipping beach bums may contest the inclusion of any beach from a country where it rains about <a href=\"http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp\">225 days of the year</a>. However, this is no common-or-garden pebbly excuse for a beach, but a drop-dead-gorgeous sandy supermodel. And who needs sunbathing when you have dunes to explore, a child-friendly river to paddle, rolling waves to play in, and billowing expanses of pristine sand for walking. The beach, with its surrounding dunes and lagoons, is a designated 'special area of conservation' \u2013 look out for cormorants, mute swans and herring gulls, and a landscape dotted with wild pansy, lady's bedstraw and pale dog violets.</p> <p>We found it by accident on a long drive out to Ireland's most south-westerly tip on the Mizen Head peninsula (worth a trip to see the cliff-top lighthouse). The nearest towns are the picturesque fishing village of <a href=\"http://www.crookhaven.ie/\">Crookhaven</a> and charming <a href=\"http://www.discoverireland.com/gb/ireland-places-to-go/placefinder/g/goleen-cork/\">Goleen</a>.Both are grand spots for a post-swim pub warmer and pack of Tayto crisps.<br><strong>Georgia Brown</strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at:</strong> There's a holiday <a href=\"http://www.caravansitefinder.co.uk/parks/3234/view\">caravan and camping</a> park right near the beach or you could stay at <a href=\"http://www.barleycovebeachhotel.com/\">Barley Cove Beach Hotel</a> or hire <a href=\"http://www.dreamireland.com/search/search.php?q=Barley+Cove&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\">self-catering cottages</a>. </p> <h2>5.

On the wilder Atlantic coast, the dunes and beach eventually evaporate in a shimmering heat haze and the sand is so fine and so deep it squeaks under foot. On the Bassin d'Arcachon side, the sea is calmer and faces the towering Dune du Pilat, the largest sand dune in Europe. Here parents and children wade through tidal pools and salt marshes hunting for crabs with <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=EJiFKp_8cK4\">Monsieur Hulot-style</a> nets - a remembrance of summers past. </p> <p>Cap Ferret has been described as a \"Gallic version of East Hampton\" popular with the Bordeaux bourgeoisie. But you wouldn't know it - there's an understated elegance to the holiday villas that line the avenues. The sprinkling of chichi boutiques and restaurants sit comfortably with the brightly-painted wooden cabines de p\u00eacheurs, most of which are still operational, but have been known to fetch upwards of \u20ac1 million when they occasionally come up for sale. Poets and artists, including Jean Cocteau and Le Corbusier, first discovered the pleasures of Cap Ferret in the early 20th century. Chez Hortense - originally set in a fisherman's house until the sand eventually consumed it and it had to be artfully recreated - has been serving mussels and frites to the fashionable set since the 1920s. But a few miles up the road in Le Canon is <a href=\"http://larkeseon.com/index.htm?lang=en\">l'Ark\u00e9s\u00e9on</a>, a homely little bar-tabac-restaurant-brasserie in a lane off the oyster port, where you can enjoy un panier d\u00e9gustation de fruits de mer for \u20ac19. It's the sort of place you dream about finding when you're contemplating a holiday at the French seaside. <br><strong>Andy Pietrasik</strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at</strong>: Hotel Oceane, 62 Ave de l'oc\u00e9an, Cap Ferret, +33 05 56 60 68 13.

A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnn2ZXuxBvE&amp;feature=related\">pretty stone village</a>, complete with old men in black berets and a sweet gelateria. A 20-minute walk away is a tiny cove with sand the colour of vanilla ice-cream and minty clear water. It's overlooked by a disused tuna-processing plant (the area is famed for the Mattanza, the annual ritual slaughter of tuna off the Egadi islands) and towers of rock. There's nothing here so bring plenty of water and a beach mat, lie back and think of Brad Pitt (he filmed part of Ocean's Twelve on this very spot). Out of season, you may well find you have the beach to yourself as few locals will brave the sea in April and May. In August, it's a different story - be prepared to rub sun-creamed shoulders with the rest of Sicily. At the end of the day, when you're sleepy, hot and sandy, retire to Scopello's 13th-century shady walled square for reviving gelato under the ancient eucalyptus tree. <br><strong>Isabel Choat</strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at:</strong> Nearby agriturismo Tenute Plaia from \u20ac130 per double B&amp;B, +39 0924 541476, <a href=\"http://www.plaiavini.com\"> plaiavini.com</a>. </p> <h2>7.

Many of the beaches we negotiated - through intermittent drizzle, hot sun and whip-like winds - were lovely and memorable, but one exceeded the rest in its sheer beauty. Three Cliffs Bay isn't the beach where we were informed we were the first swimmers of the year without wetsuits; it isn't where we bought boogie boards and ice-creams; nor where we drank end-of-the-route celebratory pints in the cosy back room of a pub. There are none of these things there. </p> <p>But it is the beach where, after trailing single file up an overgrown sandy path that scooped us up on to a grassy headland, we all stopped to coo at the gorgeousness of the little U-shaped golden cove. </p> <p>It's hard to reach as it is only accessible via a path through woodland from Parkmill, or down from Penard, so was pretty much deserted, and, in high season, it's never as busy as the Gower's bigger, more popular stretches of sand. On the cliffs above is Penard Castle, a ruin offering a perfect picnic shelter with Michelin-star views, and from here, if you can face the walk back up, you can run or roll down the stee banks, back to the glorious sands.<br><strong>Gemma Bowes</strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at:</strong> Eastern Slade Farm Campsite, 07970 969814, from \u00a38-12 per pitch per night, depending on size of tent.</p> <h2>8. Sopot, Poland</h2> <p>The words powdery white sand and Poland may not appear to be a natural fit, but that's what you'll find in the Baltic spa town of <a href=\"http://www.sopot.net/english.htm\">Sopot</a>: a pristine beach so vast that it never gets crowded, even in high summer. Once the playground of the Prussian aristocracy, the city has been Poland's most fashionable resort for almost a century. And since the end of the cold war, it has become its party capital, too, with a superb clubbing scene and a busy, boozy bar culture. Try Club Mandarynka in town or Copacabana Beach Club, which started life as a beach shack and is now an all-night disco complete with swimming pool. For the health conscious, it is backed by cycle paths, promenades and woodland trails, and is home to Europe's longest wooden pier. <br><strong>Gavin McOwan</strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at:</strong> Villa Sedan (+48 58 555 0980; <a href=\"http://www.sedan.pl\">sedan.pl</a>). Doubles from \u00a345.</p> <h2>9. Egremni, Lefkada, Greece</h2> <p>There is a reason why Greece has so many blue flag beaches \u2013 with over 15,000km of coastline, only Spain can offer similar variety on the theme of sand and sea. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBUVmvcIrJA\">Egremni beach</a> on the Ionian island of Lefkada is a perfect example. Climbing 350 or so steps down a dramatic cliff face deposits you on a long, pristine beach. The water is that perfect Mediterranean blue, almost as if it had been painted, and the pebbles get finer as you near the water's edge until they feel like sand. </p> <p>Being rather isolated, Egremni was a local's secret for a long time, though a nearby road now brings in the tourists. There are no watersports, and few distractions beyond the sea, but it is such a perfect spot, you won't need anything else. Lefkada itself might not be the most beautiful of Greek islands but it does have some fine little tavernas and two or three other spectacular beaches \u2013 most notably Porto Katsiki, Agios Nikitas and Pefkoulia. <br><strong>Paul Hamilos</strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at</strong>: Vassiliki Bay Hotel, a three-star, 24-room hotel near a fishing village, and a good spot from which to explore the island's beaches. <a href=\"http://www.hotelvassilikibay.gr/\">hotelvassilikibay.gr</a>.</p> <h2>10. Warnem\u00fcnde, Germany</h2> <p>It's not the most perfect beach in Germany but Warnem\u00fcnde offers a great holiday experience for anyone wishing to sample Deutschland's bracing Baltic coast - a white sandy beach, old-fashioned wicker chairs, known as <em>Strandk\u00f6rbe</em>, and smoked fish. The beach, not far from the city of Rostock, also offers a bold dilemma \u2013 do you get your kit off? Like most beaches in Germany's former communist east, Warnem\u00fcnde has a naturist and a 'textile' area. The resort has become something of a battleground between naked, bikini-hating <em>Ossis</em> (easterners) and their more prudish West German cousins. During my visit I asked one sun-browned kiosk-owner why he swam trunkless. He paused, then replied proudly: \"In East Germany, we didn't have trunks.\" Even in summer the sea - known by Germans as the <em>Ostsee</em>- is bitingly cold. For me, a five-minute dip was enough. <br><strong>Luke Harding </strong></p> <p><strong>Stay at</strong>: Warnem\u00fcnde's modern <a href=\"http://www.jugendherberge.de/de/\">youth hostel</a> - a lighthouse-shaped building at the end of the beach.

  "<p>As many readers have pointed out, it was misleading of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/06/france.islam\">Laura Agust\u00edn</a> to imply that Faiza Silmi was not granted French citizenship solely on the account of her wearing the niqab. </p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/07/11/une-marocaine-en-burqa-se-voit-refuser-la-nationalite-francaise_1072401_3224.html#ens_id=1072404\">article</a> published by le Monde, Silmi recognised that she had adopted the niqab after her arrival in France from Morocco, at the request of her husband. This is surely enough to raise eyebrows, even though she claimed to wear it \"more by habit than by conviction\". So what stops her from taking it off, except perhaps the influence of the men surrounding her? Other details were also conveniently omitted: Silmi appeared to live secluded from French society, not knowing the first thing about secularism and the state and, more worryingly, the right to vote. In contrast to what some comments have stated in the thread, the refusal to accept Silmi as a citizen is not just a reaction to her religious clothing, but a republican concern to ensure that all French citizens adhere to the principles of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2903663\">la\u00efcit\u00e9</a>.</p> <p>However, it strikes me that denying Faiza Silmi citizenship amounts to penalising this woman, who didn't deserve such a harsh judgment. If the conseil d'etat was wrong, and if Faiza is acting according to her own free will by choosing to wear the niqab, the French state becomes a patronising entity punishing her for holding her <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-salafi.htm\">salafi</a> beliefs (even if there is something in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/religion.women\">AC Grayling</a>'s point about being complicit in one's own oppression). But if officials were right to be suspicious of a strong patriarchal system working to eradicate her agency, why would she be punished? In this context, wouldn't she be a victim, stripped of vital knowledge and basic rights, as opposed to a perpetrator of anti-republican acts?</p> <p>Therein lies the problem: no one can deny that French secularism works better on paper than it does when applied by government officials dealing with religious or ethnic minorities who are systematically discriminated against. An oppressive patriarchal system is not unique to immigrant populations and yet a white female immigrant, no matter how ignorant of her own rights or how hopelessly submissive to her husband she was, would probably not have to face such humiliating scrutiny when applying for citizenship.</p> <p>As utterly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/13/france.immigration\">flawed</a> as it is, the French immigration system is faced with a hard task in having to judge a woman's chance of integration. Their decision is almost impossible, and they are stuck between paternalism and intolerance when confronted with a major issue faced by many immigrant women: a lack of awareness of their own rights. In many <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/5050/16_days/enslaved\">situations</a>, ranging from sexual trafficking to arranged marriages, women can be kept in the dark on purpose, becoming highly dependent on a partner who has a legal status and a job and left unable to fend for themselves and live an independent life.</p> <p>Take the example of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/281026.stm\">Hawa Gr\u00e9ou</a>, an immigrant who \"picked up her piece of Mali and <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/a_girl_a_knife_and_hawa_greou.jsp\">took it with her</a>\". For years, Gr\u00e9ou was an illegal \"exciseuse\" performing <a href=\"http://wgst.intrasun.tcnj.edu/newsletter/archives/april1993.html\">clitoridectomies</a> on babies and young girls within the immigrant community in France, before finally being jailed for 5 years. Unable to read, she always believed that the Qu'ran mandated circumcision but later changed her mind about the practice, accepting that her residence in France constituted a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract\">civil contract</a>. </p> <p>Digging a little deeper, Gr\u00e9ou's story turns out to have been a vicious circle of violations and abuse, some of which she replicated later in life: she married her cousin (who later took on another two illegal wives) and was sent to France without any means to learn the language. As explained by Kay Dilday, it was the ignorance of her own rights that prevented Gr\u00e9ou from claiming the citizenship which, as a resident in France for more than five years, she was entitled to, regardless of her husband's consent.</p> <p>Instead of continuing to see women of colour and practicing Muslims as an enemy unable to thrive in a secular democracy, the state should try its best to put them at the centre of the equation by reaching out to isolated immigrant communities with empowering tools. Many associations, such as <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/66741/Neither-Whores-nor-Submissives-Secularism-Equality-Pluralism\">Ni Putes Ni Soumises</a> (whose <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/09/news/france.php\">founder</a> was later <a href=\"http://www.islamtoday.com/showme2.cfm?cat_id=38&amp;sub_cat_id=1244\">enticed</a> to join Sarkozy's cabinet) or <a href=\"http://www.insoumises.org/dotclear/\">Les Insoumis-es</a>, are already hard at work, defending the rights of women living in impoverished <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banlieue\">banlieues</a>. </p> <p>Likewise, the French association <a href=\"http://lescaravanieres.free.fr/index.html\">Les Caravani\u00e8res du Sud</a> has promoted a revolutionary, grassroots agenda for many years: it comprises a group of social workers who travel around France setting up Berber tents in inner cities and underprivileged suburbs. Thanks to its team of Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian volunteers, it is able to give away health and legal advice to immigrant women who often do not know about bilateral divorce procedures, the rights granted by marriage and civil partnership or the <a href=\"http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/FRANCE/LABOURCODE-FR.htm\">code du travail</a>. </p> <p>Education in and outside the republican school system is essential, and giving residents of all ages the means to assert their independence is the first step in guaranteeing the protection of the French republic's values \u2013 with or without the veil. If the government is sincere about its message of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libert\u00e9,_\u00e9galit\u00e9,_fraternit\u00e9\">Libert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9 and Fraternit\u00e9</a> for its (future) citizens, it should put its money where its mouth is and support more of these initiatives instead of punishing women.</p>",
  "<p>Georgia today said three Russian jets had entered its airspace and dropped bombs at two locations just south of a rebel enclave in the breakaway region of South Ossetia.</p> <p>The announcement came as Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin, who is in China to attend the opening of the Olympic games, said that \"aggressive\" action by Georgia would incur a \"response\" from Russia.</p> <p>A Georgian interior ministry spokesman, Shota Utiashvili, said two Russian military planes had attacked a police station near the town of Kareli, and a third dropped a bomb near the border town of Gori. Several civilians had been wounded in Kareli, he said.</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who has ordered the mobilisation of reservists, was quoted by Reuters as saying \"the greater part\" of South Ossetia had been liberated.</p> <p>Russia's Interfax news agency said Georgian troops had entered the separatist South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali, a claim denied by Georgia.</p> <p>Interfax quoted its correspondent on the ground as saying heavy fighting was raging in the south of the town, but Utiashvili said the information was \"not correct\".</p> <p>Rather, he said, Georgian forces were engaged in a battle with two convoys of trucks that had entered South Ossetia from Russia and were trying to reach the breakaway capital.</p> <p>\"We want to give time to the remaining civilians to leave Tskhinvali, \" he said, adding that Georgian forces would enter the capital \"if the need arises\".</p> <p>South Ossetia's leader, Eduard Kokoity, said his own troops were still in control of the capital.</p> <p>\"We are in full control of the capital city. Fighting is on the city limits, \" he told Interfax.</p> <p>Georgian television said Georgian troops had taken eight South Ossetian villages, including Sarabuk, a strategic vantage point on high ground.</p> <p>Whatever the precise battle details, it was clear that a serious conflict had broken out only hours after President Saakashvili promised a unilateral Georgian ceasefire and offered South Ossetia the chance of broad autonomy within Georgia. The number of casualties was unclear but likely to be high.</p> <p>All eyes were on Russia and its peacekeeping contingent in the area, which Georgia accuses of supporting the separatists. The Russian peacekeepers said the Georgians were targeting their positions and they had lost some men. In Moscow, Russia's security council was due to meet in an emergency session today.</p> <p>The crisis in the Caucasus represents the first major test for Russia's new president, Dmitry Medvedev, but Putin's comments from China showed that he may be the man who still really calls the shots.</p> <p>Georgian forces appear to have the upper hand and the element of surprise at the moment but they could soon find themselves fighting on two fronts, as another separatist region, the Black Sea enclave of Abkhazia, announced its troops were moving towards the Georgian border. Cossaks from Russia said they were also ready to go to the aid of the South Ossetians, many of whom have Russian citizenship.</p> <p>In Tskhinvali, Kokoity was meeting Teymuraz Mamsurov, the leader of North Ossetia, which is just over the border in Russia. The North Ossetians have also promised help to their South Ossetian brethren. </p> <p>Mamsurov said a convoy of lorries carrying humanitarian aid from his region was attacked by Georgian war planes during the night.</p>",
  "<p>Lopez Lomong, the Sudanese-born 1,500m runner who will lead the USA team at the Olympic opening ceremony today, said this morning that he would carry his adopted country's flag as an athlete rather than a political activist.</p> <p>Lomong's appointment as flag-bearer for the US team is politically charged. China has been widely criticised for its support for the Sudanese regime, which stands accused of sponsoring genocide in Darfur. Lomong has been outspoken in the past about China's role in the region and is a member of the Team Darfur movement, but he declined to be drawn into any political comment today.</p> <p>He did however criticise the Chinese government's decision to revoke the visa of 2002 speed-skating gold medallist Joey Cheek, who founded Team Darfur and planned to speak out on the issue while in China.</p> <p>\"I'm here as an athlete,\" Lomong said. \"I'm here to represent my country to the fullest, and I'm here to be an ambassador for my country. I'm here to inspire other kids who are out there watching these Olympics, as I was watching the Sydney Olympics.</p> <p>\"Me coming here ... I'm here to compete for my country. The Olympics are supposed to bring people together to peacefully blend and I'm looking forward to that and stepping on the track and wearing my colours and representing my country.</p> <p>\"I'm disappointed ... that Joey Cheek is not here. He's supposed to be here. He's an Olympian. It's supposed to tell people about the situation that happened.\"</p> <p>Lomong's journey to the Olympics is one of the more remarkable of the games. Abducted by Sudanese rebels aged six, he escaped and spent a decade in one of Kenya's \"lost boys\" refugee camps.</p> <p>In 2000 he saw Michael Johnson competing in the Sydney games on a black and white TV set, and a year later he moved to the US. He was granted citizenship just over a year ago, and is one of three US 1,500m runners born overseas.</p> <p>Questioned about Lomong's selection, Chinese Olympic official Cui Dalin said that \"sports competition and politics are separate\". \"We hope that these Beijing Olympic Games can enhance friendship between different countries and regions and enhance friendship between athletes,\" he added.</p>"
