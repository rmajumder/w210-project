  "<p>Be careful what you wish for. That's one of the lessons that should be apparent as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601072&amp;sid=a_JoutmpfL_U&amp;refer=energy\">the price of oil continues to plunge</a>. </p> <p>It's certainly true that falling oil prices are one of the few bits of good news to be had as the US heads into what will likely be a nasty recession. It will be far easier for consumers in the US and elsewhere to weather an economic downturn with oil at $60 a barrel, rather than at $145. But some analysts are suggesting that <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/28/business/renover2.php?WT.mc_id=glob_mrktg_lead&amp;WT.mc_ev=click\">oil could fall to $50 per barrel</a>, or even lower, and stay at that level for months or even years to come. Such a sustained period of low oil prices could hurt the long-term interests of both the EU and the US. </p> <p>First, cheap crude will likely short-circuit the push for renewable energy, increase greenhouse gas emissions and slow the push for greater fuel efficiency. We've seen this happen before. The surge in oil prices that occurred after the 1973 oil embargo didn't last. As prices softened, so, too, did the interest in solar power, wind power and other technologies. The best hope for the renewable energy sector is a sustained period of high prices for fossil fuels of all types, from coal and oil to natural gas. </p> <p>As for climate change, we can argue all day about the appropriate level of global carbon dioxide emissions. But if policymakers really want to decrease carbon dioxide emissions, cheap oil is the last thing they should want, as low-cost motor fuel will allow the US, as well as developing countries like China and India, to keep pounding on the gas pedal. In China, some <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1850413,00.html?xid=feed-yahoo-biztech\">25,000 new cars per day</a> are hitting that country's roads. By 2013, the International Energy Agency expects the number of motor vehicles around the world to increase to some 1.2bn. The more cheap fuel there is, the more those vehicles will be used and the more carbon dioxide gets pumped into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Cheap crude could short-circuit the push for greater automotive fuel efficiency, both in the US and elsewhere. Motorists respond to high fuel prices. Over the past two years or so, as gasoline prices soared, sales of more fuel-efficient cars jumped dramatically. If crude (and therefore, gasoline) prices continue to fall, US motorists are more likely to continue driving big cars, pickups and SUVs. </p> <p>A collapse in oil prices would also hammer America's domestic oil and gas sector. We've seen this before, too. In the early 1980s, the smart people in the energy business were convinced that high prices were here to stay. That illusion ended with the oil price crash of 1986, after which drilling rigs and valuable oil field equipment was cut up and sold for scrap. Skilled oilfield workers left the industry for good. Today, the global energy sector continues to struggle with a shortage of skilled talent for nearly all segments of the business, from engineers to welders. A collapse in prices will result in a replay of the 1980s when skilled workers fled the oil and gas business for other industries and never returned. </p> <p>A collapse in oil prices would increase US reliance on foreign oil, as well. Once again, we've seen this happen before. Back in 1985, when global prices were relatively high and America's domestic oil industry was on the upswing, US crude oil imports fell to 3.2m barrels per day, their <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/mcrimus2a.htm\">lowest level since the early 1970s</a>. By 1993, with prices at about 50% of their 1985 levels, crude imports had more than doubled, to nearly 6.8m barrels per day. Furthermore, Opec's share of those crude imports <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/mcrimxx2a.htm\">rose from 41% in 1985 to 54% in 1993</a>. (In 2007, <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_epc0_im0_mbblpd_a.htm\">Opec's share of the US crude import market</a> was 53.7%.)</p> <p>If we experience a prolonged stint of low crude prices, the US oil industry will, once again, fall on hard times. That will likely mean that foreign producers, who generally have lower production costs, will increase their share of the US oil market, and they will do so at the expense of domestic producers. </p> <p>Furthermore, low prices will exacerbate Mexico's already perilous economic situation and may increase the flow of Mexican immigrants northward. Given America's renewed focus on immigration issues, this issue gets scant attention. But the facts are clear. Mexico has long depended on oil revenues to fund its government. In 2006, the Mexican government got 37% of its revenues from cash generated by the state-owned oil company, Pemex. A sustained period of low prices would devastate Pemex, an inefficient company that has struggled to keep production up at its largest and most important oil field, Cantarell. That field is the world's second-largest oilfield, (behind Saudi Arabia's Ghawar) and production from the field has been falling by about 8% per year. Without substantial oil revenues, Mexico's already weak central government will become weaker still. As conditions in Mexico deteriorate, the country will have more impoverished workers who will be inclined to migrate northward in search of better opportunities. </p> <p>Finally, cheap oil undermines the US ethanol industry. Regardless of your opinion about the corn ethanol subsidies and mandates, cheap oil makes the economics of ethanol - made from corn or other substances - much more difficult. And with many ethanol companies declaring bankruptcy in recent months, the problems will only grow. Rumours are now surfacing that the ethanol sector may seek a bail-out from Congress. If low oil prices persist, the potential for a bail-out becomes more probable. </p> <p>The punch line here is obvious: Cheap oil may be good for the short term, but the longer-term consequences could be painful indeed.</p>",
  "<p>The US credit card company American Express is shedding 7,000 jobs as it grapples with a surge in bad debts among customers who are feeling the pinch from the global economic slowdown.</p> <p>In a sign that the credit crunch has reached even AmEx's relatively affluent cardholders, the company is embarking on a wide range of cuts \u2013 including reducing its workforce by 10% \u2013 intended to produce savings of $1.8bn (\u00a31bn) annually.</p> <p>The firm has imposed a recruitment freeze and is halting pay rises for its management. Spending on travel, consulting and entertainment will be scaled back and the group will reduce its budget for technology and marketing.</p> <p>The chief executive, Kenneth Chenault, said: \"The re-engineering programme we announced today will help us to manage through one of the most challenging economic environments we've seen in many decades.\"</p> <p>On Wall Street, shares in AmEx have slumped by 26% this month amid rising concern about a slowdown in consumer spending and a build-up of delinquent debts in the credit card industry.</p> <p>AmEx last week revealed a 23% slump in quarterly profit to $861m. It made accounting provisions for losses of $941m. In a year, the proportion of debts to be written off by AmEx has doubled from 3% to 6.1%.</p> <p>In common with other card issuers, AmEx has been clamping down on customers' credit limits and has tightened criteria for applications for new cards.</p> <p>The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's recently put the company on watch for a downgrade, saying \"dislocations in the global credit markets are resulting in unprecedented challenges for wholesale-funded institutions, including AmEx\".</p> <p>Banks including Citigroup and JPMorgan have made it clear that credit card liabilities are likely to rise.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, the global credit cards processor Visa said its revenue growth was likely to be \"somewhat challenged\" as the international economy slowed, affecting the number of card transactions.</p> <p>Americans owe about $900bn on credit cards. In a joint proposal, business leaders and consumers' representatives this week called on the US government to back a huge programme of forgiveness in which lenders would reduce the amount owed by customers by as much as 40%.</p> <p>Travis Plunkett, the legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, said the plan would \"help many customers in serious debt trouble pay back much of what they owe and avoid bankruptcy\".</p> <p>Credit card rewards programmes have become less generous and even credit card junk mail has become less prevalent - the US Postal Service recently said it expected to deliver 9bn fewer items this year, largely due to fewer mailshots from financial institutions and the housing industry.</p>",
  "<p>No corner of the Earth is immune from the effects of global warming, according to a new study that confirms manmade temperature rises in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Temperature records over the last century show that warming in the planet's coldest and most remote wildernesses is caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>The study, published today in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ngeo/\">Nature Geoscience</a>, is the first to find the fingerprints of manmade global warming on the Antarctic, where a shortage of data makes it hard to be sure. Last year's report, from the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC), said human influence could be detected on every continent, except Antarctica. Climate sceptics have exploited this omission to question the science of global warming.</p> <p>In the new study, Nathan Gillett, then working at the <a href=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/\">Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia</a>, though now at Environment Canada, compiled, with colleagues, climate data across the Arctic and Antarctic regions since 1900, and compared the patterns with those produced by computer simulations with and without human activity. </p> <p>They say only the models that included human influences \u2013 such as emissions of carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) \u2013 were able to reproduce the observed temperature trends. </p> <p>Gillett said: \"The main message is that for the first time we are able to directly attribute warming in both the Arctic and Antarctica to human influence. Melting of ice shelves has implications for sea-level rises.\" </p> <p>Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/hadleycentre/\">Met Office</a>, who worked on the study, said: \"In both polar regions, the observed warming can only be reproduced in our models by including human influences, natural forces alone are not enough. </p> <p>For a long time climate scientists have known that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/28/arctic-ice-climate-change-thinning\">Arctic areas would be expected to warm</a> most strongly because of feedback mechanisms. But the results from this work demonstrate the part man has already played in the significant warming that we've observed in both polar regions.\"</p> <p>The polar regions have seen some of the most dramatic impacts of climate change on the planet in recent years. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average, which has contributed to record melting of sea ice in the Arctic summer and thinning in the winter. </p> <p>The picture in Antarctica is more complex, but the rocky Antarctic peninsula has experienced temperature rises of 3C over the past 50 years \u2013 among the largest recorded. Other parts, including the vast east-Antarctic ice sheet, have seen less change.</p>",
  "<p>After a period of Rothschild-enforced silence George Osborne dipped his toe into the parliamentary pool again today. </p> <p>He knew the water at this month's Treasury question time would be colder than it was off Crete this summer and sat there, shivering on the poolside for a full 12 minutes, before jumping in with a question. Cheers and jeers greeted the splash.</p> <p>A few minutes earlier Labour MP Lyn Brown had accused the shadow chancellor of leaking market sensitive data about the recapitalisation of the banks \"on the Andrew Marr show\". </p> <p>She had been called to order by the Speaker, Michael Martin, because she had not given Osborne advance warning of a personal attack.</p> <p>So Osborne began with a joke. \"I look forward to the advance warnings of attacks on me, which would certainly have helped in the last week,'' he ventured. </p> <p>More cheers and jeers and again the Speaker intervened. \"We must allow him to be heard.\"</p> <p>The thrust of the young thruster's question to Alistair Darling was that the government must act as responsibly as ministers were telling banks to act. </p> <p>The chancellor should therefore abandon the increase in small company tax rates planned for next April. Do it now - or you will have to do it later - Osborne ventured, his natural self-confidence reasserting itself as the water started to feel a bit warmer.</p> <p>Alistair Darling is a hard man to annoy. He declined to take the bait, fended off the challenge with a remark about helpful lower income tax rates and reminded watching voters that the Tories' variable fuel duty escalator scheme - cooked up as oil prices soared last summer - would now be pushing prices UP again instead of DOWN.</p> <p>At this point Master George struck out into deep water with an attack on what he called \"irresponsible spinning about Keynsian spending splurges and all this irresponsible nonsense about borrowing without limit\". </p> <p>Since the present chancellor couldn't or wouldn't \"spin\" - let alone \"irresponsibly\" - to save his life it prompted more Labour catcalls and scolding cries of \"no judgment\".</p> <p>Darling proceeded to warn him to say \"a little less about spinning\" (nudge, nudge) which is about as vicious as he ever gets before contrasting the various and incompatible statements about increased public borrowing which have come from Dave 'n' George and their allies in recent weeks. </p> <p>His main thrust, conveyed several times in the 45-minute session, is that the Cameroons are \"completely incapable of sticking to a decision and seeing it through\".</p> <p>There is some truth in the jibe. Cameron and pre-Corfu Osborne have been quite effective in skewering the shortcomings of the Broon decade, but are all over the shop in their suggestions as to what exactly we all do next.</p> <p>But Osborne had broken the ice and was able to sit back and dry himself off. It will be easier next time. What was otherwise odd about the session was that waves of Labour MPs rose to defend small businesses from the stinginess of the reckless bankers. </p> <p>Odder still, waves of Tory MPs did the same, with the minor variation that they too were keen to defend home owners from repossession by building societies, especially Northern Rock.</p> <p>Why the Rock? Partly because it is, by all accounts, \"the most ruthless and unforgiving\" (copyright Lib Dem MP, Dr John Pugh), partly because it is now government-owned. So it is all fault of Chancellor Darling, his deputy, Yvette Cooper, and their minions.</p> <p>Two groups stood out from the bank-bashing pack: rightwing ideologues and leftwing ideologues. In the first camp were Michael Fallon, who hopes to succeed John McFall as chairman of the Treasury select committee, Chris Chope, Andrew Rosindell, David Gauke and even herbivorous Crispin Blunt.</p> <p>They asserted the rights of shareholders (quite forgetting that is now us) and the imperative need to cut interest rates at all cost. In the left camp were Frank Dobson, Dennis Skinner and other class warriors who slipped through the New Labour net. They knew whom to blame: capitalism.</p> <p>Strange to report the MP who most conspicuously rose above class warfare today was Speaker Martin. For a man wrongly accused of being \"Gorbals Mick\" by teenage snobs in the press gallery (he's actually an Anderston Mick), much accused of anti-Tory bias too, he might well have been expected to relish the discomfort of St Paul's and Oxford's Osborne. But no less than four times he threw a fatherly shop steward's arm around the little chap. </p> <p>The mere mention of the Bullingdon Club (it happend twice) had him telling Swindon's Anne Snelgrove to \"cut out that behaviour\". </p> <p>He even cut down his old leftwing adversary, Mr Skinner, when he tried another Osborne riff. It was a timely reminder that in politics your opponents are across the chamber and your enemies are on your side.</p>",
  "<p>Trevor Phillips should be applauded for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/29/social-exclusion-race-immigration\">calling for special measures</a> to help the white, working class during a recession at a recent Confederation of British Industry summit on migration. His intervention comes following increasing evidence that white, working class boys are being ignored by the political establishment, especially in education because of fears of playing into the hands of the National Front or BNP.</p> <p>When I was head of campaigns at the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/pages/eocdrccre.aspx\">Commission for Racial Equality</a> we spent a long time discussing a major campaign targeted at white working class boys who surveys showed were falling further and further behind at school in comparison with their black and Asian counterparts. CRC research had clearly shown that the effect of this was to increase racial tension in the young and fuel segregation in our cities. Despite this the campaign was quietly dropped because it was thought it would be exploited by the far right. </p> <p>As someone who is proud to say that they are white working class and went to a mixed race inner city comprehensive I admit to having strong feelings about the issue. Last year the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/aug/15/guardiansocietysupplement.immigrationandasylum\">sent me back to my old school in Lampton</a> in the London borough of Hounslow to see how it had changed over the last 30 years. In the intervening period, Hounslow, in line with neighbouring Southall, had seen a huge influx of Asian and black families, a fact reflected in Lampton's intake of more than 75% ethnic minority pupils and fewer than 25% white, a reversal of the proportions in my day.</p> <p>When I went to Lampton during the late 1970s racism was rife and many pupils left with no qualifications at all. However, when I returned last year the transformation was impressive. In 2004 it was designated a specialist humanities college and last year produced its best-ever results, with 69% of pupils achieving five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C. Just as importantly it took racism and bullying extremely seriously. </p> <p>The only blot on its record was the very high exclusion rate of white pupils. The school's Ofsted report was extremely critical about what it described as \"white lower-attaining boys\" and recorded that in 2005 almost 15% of white pupils were excluded (both temporarily and permanently), a figure way above the national average and far higher than for any other group. What astonished me at the time was how difficult it was to get any reason for this high exclusion rate from the teaching staff at Lampton, most of whom were white and seemed very reluctant to talk about the issue in case of stirring up racial tension. </p> <p>The case of white working class boys has also been highlighted by a Joseph Rowntree Foundation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jun/22/education.schools\">report</a> released in June last year. It found that they accounted for almost half of those leaving school with low qualifications or no exams at all. The report also challenged common perceptions that African-Caribbean, black or Bangladeshi pupils do worse than white pupils and found that once allowance is made for neighbourhood disadvantage, receipt of school meals and other factors these pupils are at less risk of low achievement.</p> <p>The fact is that the plight of Britain's white working classes which Phillips has raised is an uncomfortable subject for all the political parties but for different reasons. Take <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/2778467/Harriet-Harman-drops-reference-to-social-class-from-speech.html\">Harriet Harman dropping the use of the word class</a> from her speech to the TUC in September in case she was accused of resurrecting the old class war by the Conservatives. Conversely the Tories are also wary of raising the issue, fearing their words will be distorted by the media or play into the hands of the National Front or BNP. </p> <p>It is a historical fact that most of the jobs lost in poor communities during Britain's de-industrialisation over the last 30 years have involved white male workers. When you combine this with the effects of mass immigration on Britain it is easy to see why white boys have slipped behind other groups in school league tables. As Phillips points out the current recession will only make this position worse.</p> <p>In modern Britain today diversity is only discussed in terms of ethnicity, gender, sexuality or faith. Too often the result is a conspiracy of silence when it comes to talking about class. So three cheers for Trevor Phillips. Lets hope it is the start of a new cross-party campaign to recognise the role of class in our society.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell\">Royal Dutch Shell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/exxonmobil\">Exxon Mobil</a> emulated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/bp-oil-shell-profit-regulation\">BP</a> today by revealing record quarterly profits.</p> <p>Royal Dutch Shell, the biggest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">oil</a> company in Europe, beat City expectations with third-quarter current-cost-of-supply profits \u2014 which strip out unrealised inventory gains and losses \u2014 up 74% to $10.9bn (\u00a36.7bn). </p> <p>Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company, smashed its own record for the highest quarterly earnings by a US firm by delivering a profit of $14.83bn.</p> <p>Despite the better-than-expected figures, Royal Dutch Shell shares fell more than 3%, in part because of lower-than-expected production.</p> <p>\"Overall, this is a good outcome,\" said Tony Shepard, an analyst at stockbroker Charles Stanley. \"But some investors will be disappointed by the sluggish production volumes.\"</p> <p>Shell said it had benefited from higher oil and gas prices. Crude prices were more than 50% higher and gas realisations were about 48% ahead of the same quarter last year.</p> <p>Oil prices have fallen by about half from their peak in July when they reached $147 a barrel but the continued scale of oil company profits have prompted calls for lower prices for consumers and the imposition of a windfall tax.</p> <p>\"We are steering the Shell ship through rough waters and so far OK,\" said the chief executive, Jeroen van der Veer. \"Yes, we are generating large profits. Yes, we have the largest investment programme in Shell's history to create value for shareholders and to play our part in providing safe and cost competitive energy for consumers.\"</p> <p>He said that, as well as its investment programme to secure energy supplies, his company's strategy remained to pay \"competitive and progressive dividends\".</p> <p>The combination of a commitment to investment and dividend pay-outs <br>echoed BP's response this week to questions about the scale of its earnings.</p> <p>Chief financial officer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/30/royal-dutch-shell\">Peter Voser</a>, who will take over from Van der Veer next summer, said the company was on track to reach its target of asset sales of $5bn this year, although he acknowledged the credit crunch was curbing the number of buyers. </p> <p>\"We are in no rush to sell assets. It's not a fire sale,\" he said.</p> <p>Like Shell and BP, Exxon benefited from the high price of crude oil. Its profits amounted to $162m a day or $113,000 a minute, despite disruption caused to offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico by two hurricanes \u2014 Gustav and Ike.</p> <p>\"Despite the continuing uncertainty in world financial markets, ExxonMobil has maintained a strong financial position,\" said the chairman, Rex Tillerson. Capital investment of $19.3bn this year had made \"a substantial contribution to employment and economic activity in the countries in which we operate,\" he said.</p> <p>The figures are likely to raise hackles among critics of the oil industry. Exxon's previous quarter yielded profits of $11.6bn, which was itself a US record. </p> <p>The presidential candidate Barack Obama branded the company's earnings as \"outrageous\" at a time when US motorists were \"paying record prices at the pump\".</p> <p>Exxon has been attacked by the environmental movement for its reluctance to invest in alternative energy sources. At the company's annual meeting in May, a significant minority of investors backed resolutions demanding limits on the company's greenhouse gas emissions and a shift towards renewable energy.</p> <p>The Texas-based company's upstream businesses, comprising exploration and production, enjoyed a 48% surge in earnings to $9.35bn as commodity prices soared, despite an 8% fall in output. Downstream, Exxon's refineries saw profits rise by $1bn to $3.01bn.</p> <p>The figures comfortably beat analysts' expectations and Exxon's shares rose in early trading on Wall Street.</p> <p>\"US downstream was up from last year, so that was a positive surprise,\" said Gene Pisasale, an energy analyst at PNC Capital Advisers. \"They have the strongest balance sheet in the business.\"</p>",
  "<p>Richard Wolffe of Newsweek reports that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama </a>is now <a href=\"http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/sprinttotheoval/archive/2008/10/29/raising-arizona.aspx\">considering an eleventh-hour appearance in Arizona,</a> as a certain sage pundit suggested yesterday. Wolffe writes that he's swinging through the region this weekend and that they're considering a hastily arranged event:<br></p> <blockquote> <p>According to Pollster.com's averages, Arizona is a 6 point race in McCain's favor, compared to Pennsylvania--McCain's best hope of picking up a blue state--which is an 11-point race in Obama's favor. That means Obama has more reason to travel to Arizona than McCain does to Pennsylvania, no matter how far-fetched it once seemed to try to win McCain's home state.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/29/uselections2008-obama-mccain-arizona\">As I wrote previously</a>, just one visit to the state would shake up the final weekend in a way that would seem to me to have many upsides and no downsides for Obama -- the momentum, the smell of victory, the news stories about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> being at risk of losing his own state and so on. </p> <p>I now would argue even that Obama needs something like this in the last weekend. The national polls clearly have tightened a little bit. It's true that for every poll that shows the national race to be a four-point affair, there's another that shows Obama's lead to be eight or nine, and it averages out to roughly the 6.2 or 6.5 that we see on RCP this morning. But to the extent that there is movement, it is, however incrementally, in McCain's direction. If RCP is showing a margin under 5.0 by next Tuesday morning, I'd say that's a slight danger zone for Obama.</p> <p>I do mean slight. The state polls still look very strong for him. Remember -- assuming he holds Pennsylvania (where for all McCain's efforts he is still well up, as Wolffe notes) and wins all of John Kerry's 252 electoral votes from 2004, he needs only to add Iowa, New Mexico, Colorado and Virginia to win. And he seems well ahead in all those states. Even so, inertia -- just letting things go the way they're going, continuing to campaign as normal -- isn't a good idea. For the final weekend, a candidate needs to add a special wrinkle.</p> <p>I remember that Gore campaigned for 48 or maybe it was 72 hours straight at the end, and I think it really helped him. He was about three or so points behind Bush at that juncture, and as you know he won the popular vote. I think an Arizona stop may be this year's equivalent.</p>",
  "<p><strong>ET TU, BENTLEY?</strong></p> <p>'Arry Redknapp called it \"character\". Jonathan Woodgate called it \"guts\". David Bentley called it \"character\". The Fiver would like to use another word that begins with \"c\" - \"corrupt\", in the moral sense; that's all we meant - in reference to the sickening orgy of backslapping that took place after Tottenham's admittedly splendid 4-4 draw at the Emirates last night. Tottenham showed guts and character all right, but barely enough to justify charging round like they'd found a cure for eyebrow dandruff rather than slipped two points further behind Rory Delap FC. \"Could it be the turning point? Yes,\" said Woodgate, taking a brief break from cultivating the first haircut that can double up as a lounge rug. \"The manager has given us a lot of confidence.\"</p> <p>Harry Redknapp is clearly an excellent manager, blessed with the capacity to make players feel extremely good about themselves (well, wouldn't you if you looked that gravity-ridden mess up and down?) but it shouldn't really come to this with players of such quality. Is there anything in football more annoying than New Manager Syndrome? (Yes. Yes there is, but as he's not on Soccer AM any more we're not sure if he counts.) It's just an excuse for minted, shamelessly indolent tools to airbrush out a past in which they moved with all the vigour of constipated corpses. Tottenham are back again, just like they were a year ago under Juande Ramos.</p> <p>Not that anyone at White Hart Lane seems to remember him. Implicitly, both through barbed comments and sharp performances since his departure, this squad of flouncing, morally bereft chancers have eased a serrated number between the shoulders of Ramos. Still, all's well that ends well, so why should they care about a thoroughly good man who's had his professional reputation perhaps fatally tarnished simply because they couldn't give one about whether they should give one. Spurs - who will be showing character in a new 60,000 stadium after announcing plans to move to Northumberland Park some time in the future - are now only eight points off seventh place and will finish easily in the top half. \"I feel like Superman,\" effaducked Bentley after last night's game. \"I could fly home.\" And there was us thinking Jamie \"Meat and two veg\" Redknapp was the man wearing the tightest suit at the Emirates last night.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"My criteria are: are they playing regularly?

  "<p>Barack Obama is pulling ahead in a trio of western states that four years ago were considered safe Republican territory, according to recent polls. If reflected in next week's election it will represent a sea change in American politics, and a vindication of the Democrats strategy since sweeping the 2006 mid-term elections.</p> <p>Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico all voted for George Bush in 2000 and 2004. But the latest polling shows that Obama has opened enough of a lead for pollsters to consider the trio settled - along with its combined 19 electoral college votes.</p> <p>A Time-CNN poll released yesterday had Obama up 52-45 in Nevada. An AP-Gfk poll released the same day showed Obama with a 12-point lead in Nevada and a nine-point lead in Colorado. Rasmussen, also yesterday, gave Obama a 10-point lead in New Mexico.</p> <p>Another poll released Tuesday, by Suffolk University in Boston, put Obama 10 points ahead in Nevada. A month ago, the same organisation had the candidates tied.</p> <p>It wasn't meant to be like this. The Republican strategy was to appeal to the conservative instincts on social issues of the west's large Hispanic population. Combined with a candidate - John McCain - from a western state with a positive record on immigration reform, and the west would be secure. </p> <p>But this year has not followed the script. Hispanics, Republicans have discovered, are motivated by the same issues as the rest of the country: the economy, healthcare, education. And as he has sought to reassure the party's base, so McCain has retreated from his earlier bipartisan approach to immigration reform.</p> <p>\"The west has the opportunity to offer Democrats long-term growth in a way that the south did to the Republicans in the 1960s,\" said Jill Hanauer, president of Project New West, set up by the Democratic leadership in 2007.</p> <p>Both candidates spent last weekend in western states before returning to the sites of the decisive battles of the last two elections.</p> <p>\"Even if everything falls flat for Obama, and McCain gets Florida and North Carolina, there's still this firewall in the west,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk's Political Research Center. \"That should do it for him.\"</p> <p>Even beyond the three core western swing states there are signs that the wider west is turning Democrat. From Montana, where the candidates are within four points of each other, via North Dakota to McCain's home state of Arizona, where he has a narrowing margin of five points, the region is becoming hostile territory for the Republicans.</p> <p>\"This is a fiercely independent part of the country,\" said Hanauer. \"People adopt western aspirations of independence and individualism when they come here. This is the only region where 90% of voters say their state offers a unique quality of life. John McCain keeps campaigning as a westerner but in terms of quality of life and other issues that are important to westerners, he's stuck his foot in his mouth.\"</p> <p>Quality of life translates into more concrete concerns at election time. The west is the fastest growing region in the country, and as such voters are concerned about how to manage that growth. Immigration, water rights, the environment, infrastructure and education are all common concerns for voters in the west. </p> <p>\"Republicans need to start rethinking the west, their attitudes and how they talk to people,\" said David Parker, a political scientist at the University of Montana. \"It's not enough just to say keep government out of my life. This could even reshape the debate on the environment. Many conservatives here are pro-environment: they want to conserve it.\"</p> <p>Montana has one unique factor lacking in the other western states: Ron Paul. The libertarian Republican is on the ballot in the state, to some extent against his own wishes. His approach appeals to the strong libertarian bent in the state, and particularly since the economic crisis struck, he has been drawing support from John McCain. </p> <p>\"If we see Ron Paul polling around 8% that could do something which I would never normally expect - flip the state for Barack Obama,\" said Parker: \"</p> <p>Yet while McCain supporters may go for Paul in Montana, Bush supporters in Nevada are breaking for Obama. One fifth of self-described Bush voters in 2004 say they will vote for Obama this time, according to the Suffolk poll. The reason, said Paleologos, is the economic downturn.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama is winning most of the demographic groups,\" he said, noting that Obama is ahead among men and women, independents, young voters and older voters. \"The movement is driven by the collapse in the economy. Voters, even older white men, are looking at their 401ks [retirement plans] and connecting the dots: Republicans, George W Bush, John McCain, deregulation.\"</p> <p>And as elsewhere, Obama has the ground campaign, outspending and out-muscling McCain.</p> <p>\"My own door has been knocked on four times by Democratic canvassers and not at all by the Republicans,\" said the University of Montana's Parker. \"This is weird. I've never seen anything like this before.\"</p>",

  "<p>So what exactly does change look like? Barack Obama has ambitious energy and environmental plans. If he wins on November 4, who will he recruit to carry them out? Will he rely more heavily on Washington newcomers or on Clinton administration veterans who know their way around the White House? (See who John McCain might choose to green his White House <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/environment/2008/oct/29/network-mccain-cabinet\">here</a>)</p> <p>Obama's choice for a transition team leader \u2014 John Podesta, former Clinton chief of staff \u2014 suggests he's willing to look back to the Clinton years for top staff. But Obama has also surrounded himself with bright and accomplished advisers (note our interviews with energy policy chief Jason Grumet and director Heather Zichal) who are newer to the national scene. Will he fill Cabinet-level environmental jobs with fresh faces or stick to a more traditional path with ex-governors and Washington lawmakers? We asked campaign advisors, nonprofit conservation advocates, think-tank types, lobbyists, academics, and friendly looking folks behind us in line at the co-op. It's a cardinal sin in Washington to openly speculate on these matters before an election, so we promised confidentiality to many sources.</p> <h2>Secretary of Energy</h2> <p>Managing the nation's energy policy and nuclear safety is one of the most glamourless, thankless Cabinet-level positions, according to former Department of Energy officials. The secretary oversees the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and nuclear waste disposal and a lot of private contracts. \"You get a whole lot of responsibility for regulating, but you don't get a lot of credit for achieving good things in the political process,\" said Walter Rosenbaum, a former DOE consultant and energy policy scholar. Still, the position could take on more prominence in the next administration, given the amount of attention the candidates devoted to energy during the campaign.</p> <p><strong>Jason Grumet</strong><br>The Obama campaign's lead energy and environment advisor first started working with the senator when he arrived in Washington in 2005. In helping Obama develop his energy platform, Jason Grumet drew from his experience as head of the National Commission on Energy Policy and the Bipartisan Policy Center. Grumet's think-tank work has focused on building consensus among diverse interests, though the NCEP's 2004 energy report annoyed many environmentalists by calling for pollution permits to be given free of charge to polluters and by supporting a \"safety valve\" that would limit the price of pollution credits. This job has traditionally gone to seasoned governors and lawmakers, but Obama has shown affinity for policy wonks like Grumet. (Read a Grist interview with Grumet.)</p> <p><strong>Ed Rendell</strong><br>With energy issues in the national spotlight, a veteran politician with deal-brokering experience could be at a premium. The Pennsylvania governor has worked to curb mercury emissions from the state's coal-fired power plants, adopted California's tough clean-car regulations, and pushed tax credits and other measures to attract renewable energy companies. Ed Rendell was one of Hillary Clinton's key supporters during the Democratic primary, but has since campaigned for Obama. If he delivers his swing state next month, this spot (or another in Obama's Cabinet) could be his for the taking.</p> <p><strong>Dan Reicher</strong><br>Dan Reicher [PDF] has recently talked up geothermal energy as the potential \"killer app\" of the energy world. He gets his techie metaphors at Google.org, the philanthropic arm of the search engine giant, where he is director of climate change and energy initiatives. Before that he worked as an assistant energy secretary under President Clinton, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, and a sales executive at a renewable energy firm. Reicher's knowledge of venture capital and commercializing green technology make him an appealing candidate to Bill Becker, executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project. \"We're facing one of the most promising worldwide market opportunities that we've ever had, and we need this kind savvy business experience,\" Becker said. (Watch a Grist interview with Reicher.)</p> <h2>Environmental Protection Agency administrator</h2> <p>This position is traditionally given Cabinet rank, meaning the EPA administrator gets to sit at a long oval table in the West Wing. The EPA enforces (or is supposed to enforce) the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the rest of the nation's environmental laws. The next EPA administrator could also be charged with implementing a new cap-and-trade carbon emissions program, which both candidates call for (in different versions). \"That would be one of the most complicated acts ever to pass Congress,\" said Barry Rabe, a University of Michigan environmental policy and climate change scholar. \"It would call for a level of cooperation across government agencies like [the formation of] Homeland Security. And we know how difficult that has been.\"</p> <p><strong>Mary Nichols</strong><br>As one of the key leaders working to implement California's groundbreaking and ambitious 2006 climate law, Mary Nichols has eye-catching qualifications for this job. She's been chair of the California Air Resources Board since July 2007, reprising a role she held from 1978 to 1983 under Gov. Jerry Brown. In the early 1970s, she worked as an environmental lawyer, spending time at the Natural Resources Defense Council, then later going on to serve as secretary for California's Resources Agency and a senior official in the Clinton EPA. Her extraordinarily deep resume would be hard to match if government experience factors heavily in Obama's decision.</p> <p><strong>Kathleen McGinty</strong><br>Pennsylvania's top environmental official worked alongside Gov. Rendell in attracting green businesses and regulating coal and manufacturers -- no small task in the rust-belt state. As head of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, Kathleen McGinty battled with Republicans and coal industry officials and succeeded in establishing tough clean-air standards. She was a long-time Al Gore aide who first worked on his Senate staff in 1988. She chaired President Clinton's Council on Environmental Quality, the first (and only) woman to hold that position. She isn't part of Obama's inner circle of advisors, but choosing her could signal to environmentalists that he takes their concerns seriously. (Read a Grist interview with McGinty.)</p> <p><strong>Dan Esty</strong><br>A top energy advisor for the Obama campaign, Dan Esty would bring both EPA experience and academic policy chops. He served in George H.W. Bush's EPA, helping to craft the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act and the environmental provisions of NAFTA. He's now an environmental law professor at Yale, where he's written recently on sustainable business. In April he helped bring a group of governors to Yale to plot ways to fight climate change. \"With his closeness to the Obama campaign and his record with the EPA, I think he would be one of the top contenders,\" said University of Florida political scientist Walter Rosenbaum. \"He has a reputation as a moderate. But if you want someone who could rally the environmental troops, he could do that.\"</p> <h2>Secretary of agriculture</h2> <p>The secretary of agriculture oversees food and farm policy, and is charged with everything from securing food safety to promoting agricultural trade to fighting hunger. The USDA inspects and grades meats and grains, administers crop and ethanol subsidies, hands out food stamps and disaster relief, runs land conservation programs, and oversees organic labeling. The U.S. Forest Service, with its 190 million acres of forest and grassland, is also under the department's purview. Sustainable-food guru Michael Pollan recently argued that our fossil fuel-dependent food system can't go much longer without a locavorous overhaul. An innovative thinker in this position would help.</p> <p><strong>Tom Vilsack</strong><br>The former Iowa governor and presidential candidate fits the classic mold for secretary of agriculture: a popular leader from a farm state (though he grew up in Pittsburgh). Vilsack supported Hillary Clinton in the Iowa primary, and if she had won the nomination, he'd be ordering Secretary of Ag business cards right now. His decidedly moderate record on farm policy may not appeal to Obama, but, like the Democratic candidate, Vilsack strongly supports corn ethanol, at least as a bridge to cellulosic ethanol. He instituted some new regulations on Iowa's industrial hog farms, though watchdogs say he should've done much more. And he understands that sustainable rural development means more than just commodity farming. His recent op-ed in the Argus Leader (S.D.), hometown paper to Obama confidante Tom Daschle, could be interpreted as a letter of interest for the job. (Read a Grist interview with Vilsack.)</p> <p><strong>Tom Buis</strong><br>Tom Buis is president of the National Farmer's Union, the more progressive, small-farm-friendly of the two largest farm advocacy groups (the other is the Farm Bureau). He was senior agricultural policy advisor to Daschle, the Obama buddy and former Senate majority leader. And he was a Hoosier grain and livestock farmer with his brothers Mike and Jeff, who still run the family farm. Buis disappointed conservationists, hunger-relief advocates, and fruit-and-vegetable growers by endorsing last year's \"sham reform\" farm bill. Buis would be a don't-rock-the-boat (or the tractor?) choice on crop subsidies and food policy. Michael Pollan would not be happy. </p> <p><strong>Stephanie Herseth Sandlin</strong><br>South Dakota's sole representative in the U.S. House has made a name for herself as a prairie populist along the lines of Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D). Stephanie Herseth Sandlin directed the South Dakota Farmers Union Foundation before getting elected to the House, where she's a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of fiscally conservative Democrats. She sits on the House Agriculture Committee, a position that's allowed her send bountiful shares of federal crop subsidies back to her home state. If Obama wants substantial farm-policy reform, the House Ag Committee might be the last place to look. If he wants a charismatic leader who's pledged to put rural concerns before left-right ideology, Herseth Sandlin could be a possibility.</p> <h2>Secretary of the interior</h2> <p>The Department of the Interior manages 500 million acres, about 20 percent of all U.S. land, and also wields significant control over energy reserves, dealing with coal and mineral deposits on public land, offshore oil, and many hydroelectric dams. National parks, national wildlife refuges, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs also fall under the department's umbrella. Fifteen of the last 16 interior secretaries have come from Western states, where most public land lies. Break that tradition at your own peril, Mr. President-elect.</p> <p><strong>Brian Schweitzer</strong><br>The bolo-tied governor of Montana is mentioned as a Rising Star of the Democratic Party often enough to have it engraved on his belt buckle. He advocates a use-'em-all approach to energy sources, including \"clean coal,\" liquefied coal, and Montana oil as well as renewable sources. A rancher who chose a Republican as a running mate for lieutenant governor, Brian Schweitzer has a knack for talking about natural resources and land-use issues in down-to-earth language. \"He can speak to the West,\" said Bill Becker. \"He's shown a talent for bridging the gap between the new West and the old West. What that means in energy terms is bridging the gap between fossil energy and renewable energy.\"</p> <p><strong>Jamie Rappaport Clark</strong><br>Bill Clinton's former Fish and Wildlife Service director managed Endangered Species Act protections and oversaw a massive expansion of the National Wildlife Refuge System. After 20 years in government, Jamie Rappaport Clark landed at Defenders of Wildlife, where she, well, defends wildlife. She has testified in Congress against Bush's Interior Department, calling it to task for manipulating science to undermine the ESA. \"There are few [people] if anybody who knows more about these issues than Jamie does,\" said Leda Clark, executive director of Endangered Species Coalition. \"She has a very practical sense of the problems and potential fixes in the department.\" One issue: She was a military child who grew up in part in California and Okinawa, along with North Carolina and Georgia. It's tough to argue that makes her a Westerner, though a Changer-in-Chief might be willing to buck that tradition. (Read a Grist Q&amp;A with Rappaport Clark.)</p> <p><strong>Jay Inslee</strong><br>The suburban Seattle congressman has earned the favor of conservationists through his leadership in protecting open spaces and wildlife. He sought to preserve roadless areas against Bush administration encroachment and has been one of the House's steadiest voices opposing logging on public lands. Jay Inslee has a lower political profile than Schweitzer and the other Western governors who could be offered this job. He wouldn't be a popular choice with Republicans, so Obama would have to think carefully about burning the political capital required to get Inslee's nomination confirmed. But his work on renewable energy, including his book Apollo's Fire: Igniting America's Clean Energy Economy, jives with Obama's focus. </p> <h2>Bonus position: climate change czar</h2> <p>By creating a prominent new position and staff, \u00e0 la Homeland Security, the next president could send a clear message that he plans to take global warming seriously. Whether such a move would be smart governing is another matter. Creating new job titles and shuffling around departments willy-nilly is no guarantee of getting anything accomplished, of course. Rather than presiding over a significant restructuring of departments, a \"climate change czar\" could function more as a special environmental adviser to the president. Then again, the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality is already charged with that job. (Look for a trusted advisor and policy wonk like Chicagoan Howard Learner to fill that role for Obama.) Still, after a year of squabbling over flag pins, both candidates ought to know that symbolism matters, and the symbolic weight of a new position might be worth the effort.</p> <p><strong>Bill Richardson</strong><br>Saving the planet might be the next logical challenge for a guy who's already been a U.S. representative, ambassador to the U.N., energy secretary, governor of New Mexico, and international peace negotiator in North Korea and Darfur. As governor, Bill Richardson signed an aggressive energy package that, among other things, required all investor-owned electrical utilities to generate 10 percent of their energy from renewable sources by 2011. As a presidential candidate, he unveiled an ambitious energy plan that included a carbon cap-and-trade system to cut greenhouse-gas emissions 90 percent by 2050 and a pledge to cut U.S. oil demand by 50 percent by 2020. He promised to be the first true \"energy president\" before dropping out of the Democratic primary and endorsing Obama. If he's ready to leave the governor's mansion in Santa Fe, this position could be an appealing fit. </p> <p><strong>Terry Tamminen</strong><br>As a top advisor to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R), Terry Tamminen helped engineer California's ambitious 2006 carbon cap-and-trade plan. He then left the state in a quest to become a \"Johnny Appleseed\" of climate action, spreading plans and ideas for cutting greenhouse gases to leaders across the country, including Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (R). He gained administrative experience during a stint as head of the California EPA from 2003 to 2004, and he wrote the 2006 book Lives Per Gallon: The True Cost of Our Oil Addiction. As a Democrat who worked under a Republican governor, Tamminen would be a good fit for Obama's post-partisan philosophy. (Read a Grist interview with Tamminen, and still more about Tamminen.)</p> <p><strong>Al Gore</strong><br>As a former vice president and creator of the highly influential film An Inconv -- OK, you already know all about the guy. If Obama wants to name a climate czar, Al Gore would certainly be at the top of the short list; Obama has said as much. Gore would bring knowledge, expertise, and unparalleled star power (unless Bono took the job ...), and he could clank his Nobel Peace Prize on the table for added gravitas at cabinet meetings. But would Gore want another government job? Last year he said no. He's been much more effective (and happy) talking about the climate crisis as a private citizen than as a government official, so it would likely take an unprecedented Obama charm offensive to get Gore into any formal position. But Obama can be a charming guy ...</p> <p>\u2022 This article was shared by <a href=\"http://grist.org/\">Grist</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/network\">Guardian Environment Network</a></p>",

  "<p>Under new visa arrangements to deter bogus students, from March next year universities and colleges will need licences to teach overseas students, the government announced today.</p> <p>Institutions will have to get a licence from the UK Border Agency (UKBA) before sponsoring non-European students to come to study in the UK.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/managingourborders/pbsdocs\">student tier</a> of the new Australian-style points-based system announced by the Home Office today is aimed at clamping down on bogus students and colleges.</p> <p>Under the plans, overseas students will have to be sponsored by a UKBA-licensed education institution and supply their fingerprints.</p> <p>Visas will only be granted to students who show a proven track record in education and are applying for a course that meets a minimum level of qualification.</p> <p>They will also have to demonstrate they can financially support themselves and any of their dependents.</p> <p>The government plans to tighten the system even further from autumn 2009, with the introduction of a \"sponsor management system\" \u2013 dedicated technology that will make it easier for universities and colleges to inform the UKBA if students fail to enrol or miss more than 10 \"expected contacts\", such as tutorials or coursework deadlines.</p> <p>The border and immigration minister, Phil Woolas, said: \"International students contribute \u00a32.5bn to the UK economy in tuition fees alone.</p> <p>\"The student tier of the points system means Britain can continue to recruit good students from outside Europe.</p> <p>\"Those who come to Britain must play by the rules and benefit the country.</p> <p>\"This new route for students will ensure we know exactly who is coming here to study and stamp out bogus colleges which facilitate the lawbreakers.\"</p> <p>The Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills has removed nearly 300 bogus colleges from its list of education and training providers since January 1, 2005.</p> <p>The higher education minister, David Lammy, said: \"I welcome the education sector's involvement in developing this implementation plan, which will help to ensure we have a structure that allows international students to benefit from the excellent educational experience the UK offers, while giving them the opportunity to work in the UK for two years following graduation.</p> <p>\"However, we will not tolerate the minority of individuals who seek to damage the quality of our education system through bogus colleges.</p> <p>\"This is why we have introduced tighter checks to the current Register of Education and Training Providers.

  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>What's so special about North Ronaldsay mutton?</strong></p> <p>Where do we start? These rare Orkney sheep live wild on the rocky shore of the north Atlantic, munching on seaweed. They have evolved to exist almost entirely on this diet, because a dry-stone wall has confined them to the shoreline since 1832. They venture out to graze at low tide, and ruminate at high tide.</p> <p>The breed is ancient - about 5,000 years old - and still exists in its pure form on North Ronaldsay, where it outnumbers the human inhabitants of the island by about 50 to one. Each October, around 300 mature sheep are caught when the tide is out and the moon is up. Many of the carcasses are spirited away to London restaurants.</p> <p>Enough about the sheep - what about the meat? The mutton is lean and rich in iodine (thanks to the seaweed diet), and is said to taste rich and gamey. We can't confirm this, as the 'mutton run' is still in progress, and the meat won't reach us until tomorrow. But as a unique local product, it should surely be celebrated. </p> <p>The following restaurants will have North Ronaldsay mutton on the menu this winter: Caf\u00e9 Spice Namaste, Anthony Worrall Thompson's restaurants, the Square, the Earl Spencer, the Royal Automobile Club and Roast. Catch it while you can.</p> <h2>IN SEASON</h2> <p><strong>Pumpkins</strong></p> <p>Pumpkins are impossible to avoid this week, but that's no bad thing. Use their flesh to make soups, stews and risottos, served in their hollowed-out shells; toast their seeds for snacking; or take a miniature specimen to work. </p> <p>There is something comical about a pumpkin - the sight of it will cheer you up until lunchtime, when you can cut it in half, stick it in the microwave for a few minutes, then mash up the flesh with some butter.

Add enough club soda just to soak the sugar. Crush with the back of the bar spoon. Add half a measure of rye whiskey and the absinthe and stir till smooth. Add ice. Stir and add remaining rye whiskey while lifting the ice and stirring. Keep stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Add a twist of lemon.</p> <p><strong>Salvatore's tips: </strong>Mixing the sazerac is a labour of love and should not be rushed. The ingredients should be mixed in slowly.

  "<p>1) <strong>Mexican grand prix, 1964</strong></p> <p>To this day, John Surtees remains the only man to have won championships on both two and four wheels, and this was the race that he secured his formula one drivers' crown. But he did it by a whisker \u2014 after 10 races, the championship was decided in the very last lap of the season. Three men went into the Mexico City finale with a chance to win the title: the favourite was points leader Graham Hill (BRM), ahead of Surtees (Ferrari) and outsider Jim Clark (Lotus), all seen in this <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=H6fvvGaa4J0\">rare footage from the race</a>.</p> <p>Hill's hopes ended in retirement after a collision with Ferrari's Lorenzo Bandini, leaving Clark in the lead and on course for a miraculous win. It wasn't to be, however, as his Lotus started leaking oil and the engine seized on the last lap, with Clark eventually limping home in fifth position. Surtees, running in third place, was helped to the title by his team-mate Bandini, who let him through into second place, giving Surtees a one-point advantage over Hill in the final points standings.</p> <p>2) <strong>Japanese grand prix, 1976</strong></p> <p>From the season when some grand prix cars boasted six wheels came one of the most enthralling battles ever or, as one commentator put it, \"the racing grudge match of the decade\". It was the somewhat familiar scenario of Ferrari against McLaren, with Niki 'the rat' Lauda pitted against James 'sex \u2014 the breakfast of champions' Hunt. Earlier in the year, Lauda had the edge over England's great playboy with a 23-point lead going into the German grand prix at the Nurburgring \u2014 but then suffered the horrific accident that left him close to death. In perhaps the greatest sporting comeback ever, he sat out just two races, returning to keep the points tally of Hunt \u2014 who was on a winning streak \u2014 in check.</p> <p>It came down to the last round in Japan, with Lauda's advantage over Hunt just three points. On race day, the fog and rain rolled down from Mount Fuji to cloak the circuit and delay the start of the finale by an hour and a half. The grand prix went ahead, with Lauda starting from third behind Hunt, but Lauda almost immediately pulled into the pits \u2014 knowing full well that doing so was likely to hand Hunt the title \u2014 as the conditions were so dire. The remainder of the race was no breeze for Hunt, however, as he suffered a puncture and crossed the line in third place and, as you can tell from <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=EBkNqJVe28k\">this fantastic clip</a>, unconvinced he had won the title. He had \u2014 by a single point.</p> <p>3) <strong>Australian grand prix, 1986</strong></p> <p>You can read the colourful report of the moment that millions of British fans cried into their cornflakes in this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/29/formula-one-motor-sport-mansell-1986\" title=\"\">From the Vault</a>, but, to summarise, Nigel Mansell needed to finish third in the season closer at Adelaide to win what would have been his first formula one title. He was lying in exactly this position when his left rear Goodyear tyre spectacularly exploded going down the back straight, sending his Williams FW11 bucking from side to side. He brought the machine under control and stopped at the side of the road before retreating to a caravan and the comfort of his wife. Alain Prost, his McLaren rival, won the race and the title in what was probably the most memorable grand prix of the 1980s and left us with a classic line from the BBC's commentator Murray Walker: <a href=\"http://pl.youtube.com/watch?v=0qTXbVsOP0o\">\"AND LOOK AT THAT!\"</a></p> <p>In <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=pYcAoxHTves\">this later interview with Walker</a>, following his 1992 title, Mansell reveals that if he'd let the car slam into the wall they'd have ended the race at three-quarter distance and he would have been world champion.</p> <p>4) <strong>Australian grand prix, 1994</strong></p> <p>Michael Schumacher's famous two-wheel moment was the culmination of formula one's most difficult season, which had been blighted by the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola. By the Adelaide finale just two men were left in the title race \u2014 Damon Hill and Schumacher, with a point separating the pair after Hill's incredible drive to victory in the wet at the penultimate Japanese grand prix. Schumacher was leading the deciding race when, with Hill on his tail, he ran wide off the track and clipped a wall. The Benetton, wobbling, rejoined and collided with the faster Williams as Hill attempted to take the inside line at the next corner. Schumacher was tipped on to two wheels and immediately retired, while Hill's race soon finished with suspension damage from the impact.</p> <p>Given the season's events Williams did not challenge the result. Schumacher won the championship ... and Hill won BBC Sports Personality of the Year. <a href=\"http://pl.youtube.com/watch?v=3VGAWfEsQsY&amp;amp;feature=related\">This clip titled 'Injustice F1'</a> highlights what many thought about the move \u2014 that it was an unsporting attempt by Schumacher to ensure he won the title. It has come to define him in the eyes of many formula one fans, and one suspects Hill has never forgiven the dastardly German.</p> <p>5) <strong>European grand prix, 1997</strong></p> <p>Some would say that Schumacher got his comeuppance a few years later, while gunning for his first title with Ferrari, in the 17th grand prix of the year held at Jerez. Williams' upstart Jacques Villeneuve had almost won the title in his debut season the year before and was just a point behind Schumacher, having taken seven wins to the German's five. Schumacher was leading the race until Villeneuve began to overtake and, with his car's nose ahead going into a corner on the inside line, <a href=\"http://pl.youtube.com/watch?v=o2MeWpZSeL8\">Schumacher drove straight into him</a>. The Ferrari bounced off into the gravel and Schumacher furiously spun the wheels in a vain attempt to get going again. He couldn't.</p> <p>Villeneuve's Williams survived the bash and went on to take third position and the title on points. The stewards were none too happy with Schumacher and he was disqualified from that year's drivers' title for his attempt to win the title by taking out the opposition (again). It would have been the Scuderia's first crown in 18 years; instead they had to wait until the year 2000, when the Red Baron bagged the first of a string of crowns without resorting to dirty tactics.</p> <p>6) <strong>Brazilian grand prix, 2007</strong></p> <p>Alright, alright, it might seem a bit cruel to bring up last year's Hamilton-McLaren debacle, but there's no getting away from the fact that when it comes down to great formula one duels that were settled in the final race, this is one of them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\" title=\"\">Lewis Hamilton</a>, in his debut grand prix season, was hoping to complete a fairytale story and win the title \u2014 and went into Interlagos with a four-point advantage. Fernando Alonso, his team-mate and, by now, arch-enemy, was second while Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was the outsider, seven points adrift of Hamilton.</p> <p>The in-fighting that had so far failed to derail Hamilton's campaign came to a head almost immediately, as he was passed by Alonso and then ran wide and dropped down the order <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=dSz_pQmaYqg\">trying to regain the place</a>. He could have recovered but, to the horror of the British tabloid editors and TV producers, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=UFkqloc_3GA\">he briefly slowed as a gearbox problem befell his car</a>. After pressing every button on the steering wheel 36 times it soon righted itself, but by then it was too late. Felipe Massa allowed his team-mate Raikkonen to slip through into the lead, Alonso came third and Hamilton finished seventh. Unbelievably, the crown was Raikkonen's, with Alonso and Hamilton finishing joint second in the standings, a point behind. It'll be a different matter in this year's finale. We hope.</p>",
  "<p>Alistair Darling today called on oil companies to pass on lower costs to consumers by cutting petrol prices as Royal Dutch Shell posted a 71% rise in profits.</p> <p>The chancellor said that he wanted the recent drop in the oil price, which has halved in recent months, to be passed on to the pumps as soon as possible.</p> <p>\"People are entitled to see the benefit of that falling price reflected in what they actually pay when they fill up the car,\" Darling told GMTV.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell\">Shell</a> defied the economic gloom this morning and smashed analyst forecasts when it reported a profit of $10.9bn (\u00a36.6bn) for the third quarter of 2008, up from $6.4bn the previous year, thanks to the earlier surge in the price of oil. </p> <p>The company benefited from the record <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">oil price</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/sep/16/oilprice\">hit $147 a barrel in July</a> before falling sharply in recent weeks. This more than made up for a 6.5% drop in the amount of oil and gas it produced, due to hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Jeroen van der Veer, called the results \"satisfactory\" and insisted that Shell was \"robust across a wide range of oil prices\".</p> <p>\"We are watching the world economic situation closely,\" he added.</p> <p>The figures come just two days after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/bp-oil-shell-profit-regulation\">rival BP sparked a row by posting a 148% jump in profits</a>. Unions and MPs called for a windfall tax on the oil giants, who they said had profited from speculation on the oil price.</p> <p>Oil was trading at around $70 a barrel today, less than half its price in July, and motoring groups have complained that this is not yet reflected in the cost of petrol. Last weekend the average price of a litre of petrol dropped back through the \u00a31 a litre mark, down from a high of 119.7p a litre in July, following price cutting by supermarkets.</p> <p>But as around 70% of the cost of a litre of petrol goes to the government as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/14/businessglossary9\">duty and VAT</a>, the drop in crude oil prices can only have a limited effect on the cost of filling up at the pump.</p> <p>The AA said it was important to keep pressure on suppliers and retailers, but warned that further price falls may be unlikely.</p> <p>\"We think the supermarkets have pared their costs to the bone and are now engaged in cut-throat competition over petrol. We can't necessarily expect the rest of the industry to move as dramatically, but it will catch up,\" said an AA spokesman. </p> <p>\"I do wonder if we've reached a bit of a trough for the moment, unless the supermarkets fight for Christmas trade by cutting petrol prices to try and fill the aisles.\"</p> <p>The fall in the value of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/currencies\">sterling, which has dropped by around 25% against the dollar since July</a>, is also undermining the benefit of lower oil prices as both crude oil and petrol are traded in dollars.</p> <p>Darling himself is under pressure to help motorists by scrapping the planned rise of 2p a litre in fuel duty, which has been postponed until March 2009, but the AA does not believe this is likely to happen.</p> <p>\"The government needs all revenue it can get, so they have no option but to bring in the 2p rise next year,\" the AA spokesman predicted.</p> <p>Shell itself struck an upbeat tone today. Van der Veer said world markets were experiencing \"unprecedented volatility\", adding: \"We are steering the Shell ship through rough waters and so far, OK.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, we are generating large profits. Yes, we have the largest investment programme in Shell's history to create value for shareholders and to play our part in providing safe and cost competitive energy for consumers,\" he added.</p> <p>The high oil price has also proved profitable for Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest oil company. It posted record quarterly profits today of $14.8bn (\u00a39bn), up 58% on last year, beating analyst expectations.</p>",

The Big Sky is at our backs as we leave the west firmly behind. The speed of life seems to quicken, accents change, and buildings pile up in what soon begins to look like one never-ending strip.</p> <p>Today, it feels like we are entering the densely populated, industrialised east. Cincinnati was once among the boom towns that sprang up in what was then a remote wilderness at the western edge of the US, settled in part by former soldiers who were given land in return for their service in the revolutionary war. Later, it became a centre of trade by steamboat and railroad, and stood as a border city between the south and the north, slave states and free states.</p> <p>It occupies a special place in American history as a major way-station along the Underground Railroad, a refuge for African Americans who crossed the Ohio river from Kentucky on their way to freedom. Quakers and other abolitionists provided safe houses where they could prepare for the journey north, and some found sanctuary in the basements and back rooms of Cincinnati's churches.</p> <p>Allen Temple, a town that dates from 1808, was burned three times in the early nineteenth century by white gangs because its members helped hide fugitive slaves. At the Zion baptist church, a deacon put on a mock funeral in order to lead escaping slaves out of town.</p> <p>The city's black churches still resonate with memories of two centuries of struggle, through Reconstruction and the civil rights movement. The struggles are by no means over. The city had a major race riot in 2001, when an unarmed black man was shot by Cincinnati police. For the African American community here, it was the breaking point after years of police misconduct and racial profiling.</p> <p>With our crew in tow, Marc Maron visited the Rockdale baptist church for a special afternoon \"homecoming\" service, where the church welcomed back members and clergy who had moved on. We were greeted with great cordiality, fed, and given the full run of the place. Members proudly escorted Maron into the sanctuary, where the congregation was jubilant, dancing and singing along with the choir. Cries of \"I am ready\" rang out across the church.</p> <p>\"I am from the deep south,\" one man told us, choosing his words carefully as he spoke of the segregation that still persists in Cincinnati. \"I experienced this all my life. It's time for a lift.\" Another said: \"This country is going to rise up\". They were talking about the Lord, but Barack Obama was at the front of their minds.</p> <p>And for them, it is all intertwined: Obama's victory, if it comes, will come by the grace of God, a culmination of centuries of faith and struggle. It is hard for some of them to believe it could really happen. Yet his victory - and theirs - is starting to feel so close that they can almost reach out and touch it.</p>",
  "<p>Authorities and aid workers are scrambling to try and find survivors and help the thousands displaced after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/natural-disasters-pakistan\">earthquake in Pakistan yesterday</a>.</p> <p>As the death toll rose to 215, emergency workers scoured the rubble and mountain areas of impoverished Baluchistan province in south-west Pakistan, near the Afghan border. Reports are still coming in from the outlying areas of more people killed from the 6.5 magnitude quake, which demolished an estimated 2,000 homes in a string of villages.</p> <p>The Red Cross said it was distributing 2,500 tents while a medical team with a tonne of supplies was helping overcrowded hospitals. Marco Succi, a Red Cross spokesman, said: \"Overall we think the situation is under control, though there is urgent need for shelter and blankets because it is freezing up there.\"</p> <p>Many people were too scared to sleep even in undamaged homes because of aftershocks, he said.</p> <p>The US and Germany have offered to help but officials say they can cope without a big international aid effort.</p> <p>News agencies said at least three hardline Islamic organisations were quick to help quake survivors. Among them was Jamaat-ud-Dawa, designated a terrorist group by the US government for links to Muslim separatists fighting in India's portion of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.</p> <p>The group set up relief camps and won friends among survivors when a bigger quake devastated Kashmir and northern Pakistan in October 2005, killing about 80,000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless.</p> <p>Yesterday, the army flew in supplies and medical teams into the hard-hit Ziarat district, where an estimated 15,000 people have been left homeless. Hospitals are treating dozens of seriously injured people.</p> <p>Last night, officials said several thousand people slept in tents erected by the military. Soldiers were unable to reach all the surrounding regions before temperatures plunged to freezing.</p> <p>Impatient crowds gathered in the hillside hamlet of Kawas as they awaited soldiers to distribute blankets, tents and jackets. Others slept in the open near the rubble of their mud and stone houses.</p> <p>\"We passed the night shivering and with the children crying. There were five of us wrapped in one blanket,\" said Ala Uddin, a 30-year-old farmer camped with about 15 relatives in an apple orchard.</p> <p>The earthquake comes at an unstable time for Pakistan as the civilian government battle al-Qaida and Taliban attacks as well as a looming financial crisis.</p>",

Three other towns in the state, which is famous for its tea plantations, were also hit.</p> <p>Officials said that 61 people were killed in the blasts with 25 people dead in Guwahati. Eleven were killed in the Kokrajhar district and 12 more died in the town of Barpeta. Another 70 are believed to be in a \"critical condition\".</p> <p>In a serious breach of security, the largest blast occurred a few hundred yards from the Assam main administrative building in Guwahati, home to the offices of the state's chief minister Tarun Gogoi.</p> <p>Television channels showed some people lying on the streets, their clothes soaked in blood. Pictures showed the charred remains of cars and motorcycles that littered the blackened roads.</p> <p>Bystanders dragged the wounded and dead to cars that took them to hospitals, while police officers covered the burned remains of the dead with white sheets, leaving them in the street. \"You cannot even recognise the cars or the people. The phones are jammed. We never thought anyone could do such acts here,\" one lawyer told CNN-IBN television news.</p> <p>An immediate curfew was announced on Guwahati as some locals, who blamed officials for lax security, rioted, attacking police vehicles and public buses. Police shut down roads leading in and out of the riot zones and said they had begun to comb the streets for any unexploded bombs.</p> <p>Dozens of militant separatist groups are active in India's northeast, an isolated region wedged between Bangladesh, Bhutan, China and Myanmar with only a thin corridor connecting it to the rest of India.</p> <p>There was speculation that the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), fighting for an independent homeland for the state's 26 million people, was behind the attacks. In an email from ULFA to television news channels the group denied responsibility.</p> <p>\"It is very early to make a conclusion, I don't rule out any persons. ULFA is an anti-national group and this is the handiwork of terrorists. When they see the public outcry they will disown their work,\" said Mr Gogoi in a press conference.</p> <p>The separatists say that Delhi's central government is not only 1,000 miles away but has little concern for local rights and is intent only on exploiting the region's natural resources. </p> <p>Many of the indigenous people are ethnically closer to Burma and China than to the rest of India. More than 10,000 people have died in separatist violence over the past decade in the region.</p> <p>The violence has taken on a religious dimension in Assam. Earlier this month members of Assam's largest tribe, the Bodo, clashed with local Muslims in murderous riots which left 53 people dead and 150,000 people in relief camps. It took troops and paramilitaries sent by the central government to stop the fighting.</p> <p>Driving these sentiments is \"illegal immigration\" from Muslim-majority Bangladesh. The state's border with Bangladesh is impossible to police. Experts say there are two million illegal migrants in Assam.</p>",
  "<p>The oracle told us that Barack Obama would eventually defeat Hillary Clinton and win the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. But what does the oracle predict for next Tuesday? Can it tell us what the whole world wants to know: who will win the race for the White House? </p> <p>The oracle is, of course, the astonishingly prophetic sixth and seventh series of The West Wing, the multiple Emmy award-winning television drama that hooked a generation of political obsessives on both sides of the Atlantic as the Clinton era turned into the age of George W Bush. In its final two seasons, originally broadcast between 2004 and 2006, The West Wing focused on the battle to succeed President Jed Bartlet, a contest whose early stages at least seemed to prefigure, with uncanny accuracy, the real-life primary campaign of 2008. </p> <p>The fictional race pitted a veteran member of the Democratic establishment, who had loyally stood at the side of a popular two-term president, against a young, inexperienced and super-charismatic member of Congress who talked of change and hope - and was seeking to become the first non-white occupant of the Oval Office. On television the veteran was vice-president Bob Russell and the newcomer congressman Matthew Santos, but their 2006 battle came to seem like a prescient dress rehearsal for the 2008 clash of Hillary Clinton against Barack Obama. </p> <p>There were dozens of similarities, but the core one turned out to be no coincidence. As the Guardian revealed in February this year, Santos, played by Jimmy Smits, was eerily like Obama for a reason: the writers of The West Wing had actually modelled their presidential hopeful on the man who was then a mere state senator from Illinois. </p> <p>They had their candidate starting out as an underdog, but eventually overcoming the party warhorse in a desperately close and long primary campaign. That much they got right. But what about the next stage? What did The West Wing foretell for the final battle between Democrat and Republican?</p> <p>At first glance, it looks as if the Hollywood crystal ball got a little cloudy. Sure, they rightly predicted that the Republicans would nominate a long-serving senator from the west who prided himself on being a maverick ready to buck the party line. But where Arnold Vinick (played by Alan Alda) was a masterful campaigner who stayed neck-and-neck with Santos to the bitter end, McCain has proved hapless, behind in the polls now as he has been for a month or more. </p> <p>Ah, but look closer. Both Vinick and McCain were chosen because they were candidates deemed to have a good shot at beating the Democrats, in part because their appeal extended beyond the conservative core vote. In Vinick's case that was because he was from a \"blue\" state, solidly Democratic California, and chiefly because he was in favour of abortion rights, enabling him to appeal to women voters who had long eluded the Republicans' reach.</p> <p>McCain is \"pro-life\" and from staunchly Republican Arizona, but back in the winter he was viewed in much the same way as Vinick. He had stood up to the evangelicals, famously describing their leaders as \"agents of intolerance\", and had regularly adopted moderate stances on immigration, campaign finance and healthcare that endowed him with all-important crossover appeal.</p> <p>But look what happened to Vinick. The Republican base, especially the Christian right, could not warm to him: they could not see him as one of their own. When he tried to ingratiate himself with them, it undermined his own authenticity. When he tried to shift towards the centre, as past form suggests all nominees must in a general election, the base did not forgive him. </p> <p>According to former West Wing writer and producer Eli Attie, who scripted several of the pivotal Vinick episodes, \"Vinick seemed threatening [to the Democrats] from a distance, but really he exposed the fault lines in his own party.\"</p> <p>Nowhere was this clearer for the TV senator than in his choice of running mate. To placate the Christian base, he had to pick a pro-lifer. He tried first to nominate the televangelist Rev Don Butler, but was rebuffed. Vinick settled eventually for the anti-abortion West Virginia governor, Ray Sullivan. But that he had to pick someone who disagreed with him on abortion rights was never in doubt. </p> <p>McCain was similarly hemmed in. It is widely known that his first choice for vice-president was his good friend and fellow senator, the Democrat Joe Lieberman. But Lieberman's pro-choice position made that impossible. McCain was threatened with a floor fight at the Republican convention, a rebellion by the faithful. To placate them, he lurched to the other extreme, picking Sarah Palin, who opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest - a decision which, given Palin's cratering poll numbers, appears to have cost McCain dear. </p> <p>In other words, this year's Republican nominee, like his fictional counterpart, has been hobbled by the deep divisions within the Republican coalition and especially by the veto power now exercised by what some call the Christianist wing of the party. Both McCain and Vinick needed to look towards the centre, but were held back by their base. Says Attie: \"McCain has been even worse at trying to have it both ways. But both were trying to hold together disparate, far-flung elements of a fractious party. Both found that you can only please one side by insulting the other.\"</p> <p>Attie also sees a deeper similarity between the two campaigns. McCain, most pundits agree, was derailed by the financial crisis that broke in September. Suddenly all the petty, diversionary issues that can dominate an election campaign seemed petty and trivial. It was back to being a battle on substantive issues and on those McCain suddenly seemed to be not only on the wrong side of the argument - tied to the Republican ideology of unfettered free markets - but even on the wrong side of history. </p> <p>There was no Wall Street collapse on The West Wing - they were not that psychic - but there was a similarly defining moment. It came with an accident at a nuclear power plant in Vinick's own state, a plant he had supported and even helped to build. Santos had no involvement in the plant, but he had long opposed nuclear power and therefore found himself on the right side of the issue of the hour. Suddenly Santos surged in the polls, just as Obama did in September. Neither had to do much except appear steady and calm, while their opponent floundered to explain a policy stance that had immediately become poisonously unpopular. In one scene, Vinick tells an aide that \"history decides, circumstance decides\" who wins an election. \"True for Vinick and I think also true for McCain,\" says Attie now. </p> <p>There have been differences, to be sure. The writers of The West Wing had turbo-charged imaginations, but even they never dared conjure up a moose-hunting, lipstick-wearing governor of Alaska who channels the spirit of Joe McCarthy with a wink and a \"you betcha\". </p> <p>Still, they got more right than they got wrong. The TV debate between The West Wing candidates was short on high drama with no memorable gaffes or zingers - just like the three serious if not stodgy encounters between Obama and McCain. Mind you, Vinick and Santos seemed to respect and even like each other - and few would say that of this year's contenders. </p> <p>So what of the denouement? How did the fictional battle end? It was close, much closer than current polls predict for the 2008 race. There was talk of legal challenges to the tightest results and the entire election came down to two small states out west, Nevada and Oregon. But, at long last, both those states went for Santos - and the young challenger, whose bid for the White House once seemed impossible, ended election night as president-elect. </p> <p>Is that how the real story will end next Tuesday? So far The West Wing has got so much right, even the show's own writers say it's \"creepy\". Those writers did finally give their viewers a happy ending. There are many millions around the world who hope that, next week, the US electorate will do the same.</p>",
  "<p>So Jonathan Ross (I'm worth 1,000 BBC journalists) is suspended and Russell Brand has resigned. MPs condemn them in the Commons: \"base\", \"vulgar\", \"puerile\", \"predictable\", they say - while on these pages Jack Straw, the justice secretary, joins in, labelling the pair \"so-called stars\". And the reaction from the BBC's cash-strapped newsroom is instantaneous. \"It's the most entertainment we have had from them all year,\" a staffer tells us. So the effort wasn't wasted.</p> <p>\u2022 Straw has also been plagued by bleeding hearts among the criminal justice lobby using impenetrable language. Last week he complained that phrases such as the \"criminogenic needs of offenders\" send him \"nuts\", and one must guess that the madness started in 1998, when he himself hailed Home Office research \"designed to assess the specific criminogenic factors associated with offending by women.\" If the justice secretary can move on from that sort of language, why can't everyone else?</p> <p>\u2022 Further and better reaches us about events at Yarl's Wood detention centre, where staff found that asylum seekers deprived of a pamphlet explaining how to construct appeals were, as a direct result, less able to mount those appeals. Yarl's Wood we know; but it's still not right. Last week we reported that officials were made to hand the pamphlets back following complaints to the UK Border Agency, and now we have an update. Of the two women so deprived, one has since been released; the other's deportation has been postponed. And it is the latter case we turn to again today, for it transpires that officials were seeking to send her back to Kenya, even though she was on suicide watch - having already made one attempt to take her life in Yarl's Wood. When London MEP Jean Lambert made representations on her behalf to the Border Agency, it was forced to admit it did not know the detainee had tried to kill herself with an overdose. Yarl's Wood simply had not told the agency. Ministers promise a system that is fast and fair, but it is obviously a work in progress. One out of two is not bad. </p> <p>\u2022 After many weeks in the eye of the storm, it should have been comforting for the National Black Police Association to escape to the sanctuary of its annual conference in York. Criticism has been unremitting since the NBPA said it would discourage black recruits. No surprise they sought to take stock among friends. And that might have been the case had they invited, as they intended, the robust but undeniably sophisticated David Davis MP, former shadow home secretary. Alas, the speaking invite went to his scratchier Tory colleague, David Davies, MP for Monmouth - who, once there, lambasted the NBPA for being racist. What to do? Davis; Davies. They all look the same. </p> <p>\u2022 But then they grow accustomed to the scandals and the subsequent apologies. Whoops, there goes another one. This time in Northern Ireland. \"There were no overweight people in Auschwitz,\" said Angie Best - former wife of George - during a BBC TV discussion about obesity. \"It was a slip of the tongue,\" says Angie, now chastened. At least her idiocy was live.</p> <p>\u2022 So did you hear the one where Gordon had to introduce Nelson to Amy Winehouse because the old boy had never heard of the hapless songstress? How, required to sing Free Nelson Mandela, she actually sang \"Blakey My Fella\". Many thousands will have heard it by now because the tale has become the stock joke for occasions addressed by the prime minister. He told it to the TUC in Brighton last month, and at the Foreign Office on October 8 at a ceremony for Britain's 100 most influential black people; he told it again in Downing Street on October 20, at a reception for activists involved in the anti-knife/gun campaign, the Peace Alliance; and yesterday we learned that at a recent lunch attended by the actor Julian Rhind-Tutt, he gave it another airing. The PM has learned, we are told, that he is best when he is bold; and with that in mind, might this not be a good time for us - and that means all of us - to find a new joke for Gordon. Think not of what he has done for us. We must do what we can for him.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",

After UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, warned of a humanitarian crisis of \"catastrophic dimensions\", the rebels announced last night they were declaring a unilateral ceasefire \"to avoid panicking the population of Goma\".</p> <p>Nkunda's men have already captured several key towns near Goma in North Kivu province and raised fears of a return to full-scale war in Democratic Republic of Congo. The national army has been routed, and troops were reported to be fleeing Goma yesterday. Tension between Congo and Rwanda, which it accuses of supporting Nkunda, also increased sharply, as they traded accusations yesterday over cross-border artillery attacks. The US said while Rwanda was not directly involved in the fighting, its territory was being used to support rebels.</p> <p>The rebel advance has caused alarm in the international community. The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, called for the deployment of a hundreds-strong EU force to eastern Congo, while the UN security council expressed \"grave concern\" at the fighting and called an emergency meeting to discuss an urgent request for more troops for the UN peacekeeping force. </p> <p>The US has dispatched its top Africa envoy, Jendayi Frazer, for talks in the Congolese capital Kinshasa. Louis Michel, the EU's development aid commissioner, was also there to meet President Joseph Kabila. Congo's previous wars between 1997 and 2003, which sucked in several neighbouring countries, caused the greatest loss of life anywhere since the second world war, with more than five million deaths, mainly from hunger and illness. Since then the mineral-rich east region has remained restive, despite a peace agreement signed by all main rebel groups in January this year. </p> <p>Nkunda, who is though to have 5,000 fighters in his National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), claims to be protecting the minority Tutsi population in the east from Hutu militias linked to the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Despite signing the deal he refuses to disarm, accusing government forces of breaking the ceasefire and collaborating with Hutu rebels. </p> <p>Both the army and the CNDP rebels have a deep mistrust of Monuc (the UN mission to Congo), the 17,000-strong peacekeeping force, and have separately attacked it in recent days. Monuc has pledged to defend the North Kivu towns of Goma, Sake, Masisi and Rutshuru, which was abandoned by the Congolese forces. But Alain Doss, Monuc's chief, said the force was \"stretched to the limit\", and has requested additional support.</p> <p>After coming under much criticism for failing to protect civilians, Monuc attack helicopters yesterday fired on Nkunda's forces in Kibumba, 19 miles north of Goma, stalling the rebel progress. </p> <p>\"We were positioned just 15km from town, but Monuc engaged us with their helicopter gunships,\" Amani Babu, a senior CNDP officer told Agence France Presse. \"We think in two or three days we will be able to take the town of Goma.\"</p> <p>Aid agencies say that would be a disaster. Around 250,000 people have been forced from their homes in North Kivu this year. Tens of thousands have fled their homes or shelters on foot this week. Around 30,000 arrived at a camp in Kibati, six miles north of Goma, in recent days, \"exhausted and traumatised\". </p> <p>But the camp emptied yesterday when refugees saw government forces retreating south \"fairly fast, and in fairly large numbers\", according to Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the UN refugee agency. </p> <p>Before the ceasefire announcement last night the atmosphere in Goma was tense. There were reports of government troops firing into the air and commandeering vehicles. Civilians hurled rocks at a UN compound near the airport as rumours swirled that the town was about to be overrun. </p> <p>Emmanuel de Merode, the director of Virunga National Park, said: \"There has been movement of government troops out of the town, which caused panic among the population.\"</p>",
  "<p>Every Tuesday, as a house, we put out two big green boxes of recycling. I say green because a) they literally are and b) the presumption is that by using them, so are we. But wouldn't it be greener not to put out the recycling - to generate so little waste that, come Tuesday, there is nothing to put in the green box? It is an idealistic notion, but is it practical? I decided to try it for a month to find out. And in doing so, I inadvertently discovered that I'd joined a movement. </p> <p>Precycling is the practice of reducing waste by attempting to avoid accumulating it in the first place. Precyclers try to cut out as much packaging as possible and, to this end, they think ahead, shop locally, buy things loose and bring their own containers. The benefits are various; from saving money and creating less landfill to reducing food miles and conserving natural resources. </p> <p>The term was coined in 1988 for a waste awareness campaign in Berkeley, California. Residents were encouraged to avoid single-use items and to buy in bulk. Affectionately known as \"wombles\", they refused junk mail, carried precycling \"kits\" (such as cloth sandwich bags and cutlery) and when the internet came, they did their reading online to cut down on pulp. Today, however, precycling is generating interest among the eco-aware. In its report in May, the US market research firm Intelligence Group found that half of all consumers thought about an item's reuse or resale cost before purchase, that 45% of US trendsetters and 14% of mainstream consumers have cut down on bottled water purchases and 49% and 16% respectively have cut down on the use of plastic bags. In the UK, financially concerned and environmentally aware consumers are turning to tap over bottled water and carrying canvas shopping bags; Sainsbury's is even reporting a 36% rise in its sales of lunchboxes.</p> <p>UK households throw away 5.9m tonnes of packaging every year, 4.7m tonnes of which is food related. Recyling is a greener option - saving between 25% and 90% of the energy it would take to create new products - but there is still an environmental cost. Recycling a plastic bottle takes a lot of time and energy; washing it under the tap does not. </p> <p>The key to being a good precycler is being prepared. This I learn on day one of my trial when I forget to bring my lunch to work and am reduced to eating fruit and ice-cream (the cone being the ultimate in edible packaging). The following day, I get organised: daily sandwiches (in a washable sandwich wrap), a travel mug, cloth shopping bags and a water bottle are on hand at all times. Gone are the impulse, convenience shopping sprees of old - to be replaced by an intentional, almost military approach to what I need to buy and from where. </p> <p>I patronise local markets, fishmongers, butchers and bakers and rediscover the joys of having bottles of milk delivered to my doorstep (milk and orange juice bottles can be reused 20 times before they are recycled). There is a nostalgic, parochial pleasure that comes from asking bemused staff at Costa Coffee to fill up my china mug, of carrying apples in a paper bag and using a handkerchief to blow my nose. It speaks of gentler times, a greater custody of care, and thoughtful, less harried, consumption. It saves me money and encourages experimentation. I make bread and cook strange recipes in a kitchen clear of jostling brands. </p> <p>However, convenience food is aptly named. Buying unpackaged is, initially, hugely inconvenient. Finding naked staples takes real tenacity, but they do exist. Shops such as Unpackaged in north London sell dried goods in open bins, beside loose toilet rolls and a small line in refillable juices and cosmetics - and give you a discount when you bring your own container. Rural and city farms are alive and well, and great for eggs and dairy, while farmers' markets and box schemes provide your five-a-day. For pulses and staples, ethnic high street stores such as Green Valley, off the Edgware Road in London, are bulk-buy havens - with sacks and spice bins of jarish and Lebanese thyme next to tubs of cashews, apricots, figs and dried sharon fruits. At the lower-budget end of the spectrum, Weigh &amp; Save outlets can still be found on the outskirts of some towns, where you can stroll through aisles of ginger cake-mix, pearl barley and dried dog food, buying only as much as you need by the gram. Meanwhile, shopkeepers in smaller, artisan shops, such as the Monmouth Coffee Company, have witnessed a bring-your-own revival, with more customers bringing their own jars to be filled. \"People are plumping for less packaging for a variety of reasons, economic and environmental,\" says Cath Conway of Unpackaged. </p> <p>So how did I do? During my month, the green halo slipped often. I still bought my mayonnaise in bottles and tuna in cans and I never did find a solution to the wine issue. (It is hard to find decanted wine, and I couldn't face Wetherspoon's superchilled draught wine.) But by the end of the month, my black bin was hardly being used and we were putting out one green bin, a quarter full.</p> <p>Eventually, says Nimish Shah, a 35-year-old precycler from London, it will be empty. Shah hasn't been to a supermarket for years. He shops at small stores and always brings his own bags. He cuts an eccentric figure at his local market, putting fish fillets in a cloth bag that he washes and reuses. \"When I look at an item,\" he says, \"the first thing I think is whether I could just do away with the packaging or, failing that, reuse it somehow. Recycling a product should be the last option really\".</p> <p>\u2022 Post questions and answers to Ask Leo The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1 3ER <strong>Fax: 020-7713 4366</strong>.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339142026\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Stumbling upon a half-hour-long infomercial on American television is usually a sign that you've stayed up too late, or clicked too far through the channels to the outer fringes of cable. But last night's 30-minute broadcast happened in peak time, on three of the main networks, and it wasn't a sales pitch for an innovative new bathroom tile-cleaning device. It was Barack Obama's final opportunity to ask a mass national audience for their votes, and he used it stirringly.</p> <p>The Democrat's 30-minute ad, costing $1m per channel, wasn't without its hazards: it risked annoying viewers forced to miss their favourite shows, and a rumour, which proved unfounded, held that it might even delay the start of the World Series baseball game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Philadelphia Phillies, a surefire way to anger audiences.</p> <p>In the event, though, the Obama Show - a combination of treacly Hollywood movie and hard-edged documentary - seemed more likely to persuade than to repel.</p> <p>Beginning with images of cornfields, railways and picket-fence homes over soaring strings, it soon cut to a shot of Obama standing, besuited, before a wooden table and a large American flag: it wasn't the Oval Office, but the resemblance was no accident. \"We've seen over the last eight years how decisions by a president can have a profound effect on the course of history, and on American lives,\" he said, before narrating the stories of four middle-class Americans, each struggling economically. They were chosen with an eye to demographics: a white married mother from Missouri, a black retired railroad worker from Ohio, a Hispanic widow, mother and teacher from New Mexico, and a white male Ford motor worker from Kentucky.</p> <p>They painted a grim picture. \"The pressure is just to keep your head above water, so you don't feel like you're drowning all the time,\" said Juliana Sanchez, from Albuquerque, New Mexico. \"You feel like you can't breathe.\" Five Democratic governors, two senators, and the chief executive of Google also all appeared to sing Obama's praises.</p> <p>But last night's ad was an effort to transcend demographic targeting in favour of a message of unity and common purpose: the Obama campaign's record fundraising, which currently stands at above $600m, has allowed him to pursue both strategies, local and national, simultaneously.</p> <p>Obama interspersed the individual stories with details of his policies, choosing an almost exclusively economic focus, except when enumerating the costs of the Iraq war - and the schools and hospitals that could have been funded with the money instead.</p> <p>He movingly related the story of his own mother's death from cancer, in biographical clips that had also been broadcast at the Democratic national convention in Denver. The infomercial, shot by Davis Guggenheim, director of Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth, finished by cutting to a live rally in Sunrise, Florida, where Obama urged supporters to spend the next six days knocking on doors and making phone calls. </p> <p>The last presidential candidate to be able to afford similar programming was Ross Perot, in 1992. John McCain's campaign certainly didn't stand a chance of competing with Obama last night: he was scheduled, instead, to appear on CNN, speaking to Larry King. Obama was even planning to rival that, with an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. </p> <p>But Obama seemed unlikely to put in a performance similar to his last one with Stewart, shortly after announcing his candidacy. Stewart, addressing the inexperience issue, asked him if he'd thought about running for president of a smaller country first. \"No,\" Obama said then. \"What I did think about, though, was invading a smaller country.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 30 2008. Obama's infomercial featured a Hispanic widow, mother and teacher from New Mexico, and a white male Ford motor worker from Kentucky. We had their states the wrong way round. This has been corrected. We also wrote that Juliana Sanchez was from Kentucky, not New Mexico; this too has been corrected. Finally, the live rally referred to was in Sunrise, Florida, not in Kissimmee, and this has also been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The Royal Society has never suggested that the world should attempt large-scale climate geoengineering schemes as a \"fix\" for climate change (Leaders, October 29). None of these technologies will provide a \"get out of jail free card\", and they must not divert attention away from national or international efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p> <p>However, the scale of the challenge we face in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change means that we need to look at all potential options and assess what their contributions might be.</p> <p>This is why the Royal Society is launching a major study today, looking at whether any of these geoengineering technologies could be feasible or effective. It will also consider what environmental and social impacts they may have and any other possible unintended consequences. Some of the proposed schemes may prove to be as implausible as they seem, others may be ambitious but have potential. We must distinguish between the two and provide policymakers with sound, independent scientific advice, so they can make informed decisions based on fact, not fantasy. <br><strong>Martin Rees </strong><br>President, Royal Society</p> <p>A gaping hole remains in the climate change bill despite the likely inclusion of emissions from aviation and shipping (Minister bows to calls on climate change bill, October 27). The government will still be able to buy \"carbon credits\" from abroad rather than taking action to reduce pollution at home. If the bill is to be more than an accounting fiddle, the Conservative party, in particular, must back our lobbying to plug this loophole. <br><strong>Ruth Davies</strong><br>Head of climate change policy, RSPB</p> <p>There is no credible evidence that algae photosynthesise faster, or are currently able to accumulate substantially more biomass, during a period of sustained growth than other green organisms (How algae could drive the future of biofuels, October 23). Intensive agriculture of any sort rarely uses less fossil fuel energy than the light energy that it conserves as biomass. Biofuels do not lead to any appreciable sparing of carbon dioxide emissions that could not be better accomplished by the most modest means of energy conservation, such as a small reduction of the legal speed limit on motorways. <br><strong>David Walker</strong><br>Emeritus professor, University of Sheffield</p> <p>Our political masters cannot be so ignorant or badly advised as to really believe that the widespread introduction of electric vehicles will cut greenhouse gas emissions (Report, October 28). At least one government scientific adviser must have pointed out that the electricity for charging batteries is currently produced mostly by coal- and gas-fired power stations. These have a lower efficiency than a modern internal combustion engine, plus account has to be taken of transmission, charging etc. Consequently, the amount of greenhouse gases produced would be likely to increase as a result of a move to electric propulsion. </p> <p>It is not worth considering the large-scale introduction of (non-hybrid) electric vehicles until a major proportion of our electricity is generated from genuinely renewable sources. Advisers must also have pointed out that the new technology batteries use rare and valuable metals, such as nickel and lithium. Furthermore, the apparent cheapness of electric propulsion is illusory; it comes about simply because electricity does not currently attract the tax applied to other road fuels.<br><strong>Richard Barnard</strong><br>Visiting fellow, University of Hertfordshire</p> <p>Your article repeats the mantra that the biggest obstacle to electric cars is the lack of a power infrastructure. There must be countless motorists, like me, who find the vast majority of their journeys are short hops. The only infrastructure I need is a socket on the garage wall. Moreover, I have just read that a new battery/capacitor combination has overcome the main disadvantage of lead-acid batteries by making it possible to recharge them without radically shortening their life. What stands in the way of the electric car is the failure of manufacturers to make small electric cars (the G-Wiz costs over \u00a38,000 without VAT) that are in any way comparable to a typical small petrol car in terms of price and performance. <strong><br>Martyn Stevens<br></strong>Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire</p>",
  "<p>Ice may be a nuisance underfoot or on your windscreen, but in the air it can be lethal. The most common cause of icing on aircraft is flying through a cloud containing supercooled water droplets. These are already below freezing point, but have not frozen. Contact with the metal surface of the plane turns the droplets into ice which sticks to the aircraft, and which can build up quickly.</p> <p>Even a thin layer of ice on a wing can spoil its aerodynamics, increasing the drag and reducing the lift. Even more sinister is when ice forms on control surfaces and cables: the first a pilot may know about it is when the aircraft stops responding to the controls. Instrument icing presents a more subtle risk, when external sensors get covered in ice, so speedometers and altimeters give inaccurate readings.</p> <p>Airliners have both anti-icing systems to prevent ice from forming, and de-icing systems to remove any ice that does form. Some use electrical heating, others take hot air from the aircraft's engines.</p> <p>A crash-landing at Heathrow earlier this year was caused by ice particles in the fuel. Aviation fuel can contain a small amount of water, and in this case the water froze, resulting in a build-up of ice which seems to have blocked the fuel feed system. This was extremely unusual, caused by the combination of very low temperatures (it was -76C between Scandinavia and the Urals during the flight) and a low rate of fuel feed.</p>",
  "<p>Joaquin Phoenix, the twice Oscar-nominated star of Gladiator and the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, is to retire from acting to pursue a career in music.</p> <p>Phoenix announced his decision to a presenter of the American celebrity TV show Extra at a benefit for charity backed by the late Paul Newman in San Francisco last night. Phoenix had been on stage performing with Hollywood glitterati such as Julia Roberts, Jack Nicholson, Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis, Warren Beatty, Danny DeVito and Sean Penn in a one-off production of Ernest Hemingway's The World of Nick Adams.</p> <p>\"I want to take this opportunity ... also to give you the exclusive and just talk a little bit about the fact that this will be my last performance as an actor,\" Phoenix told the reporter. \"I'm not doing films any more.\" His representative confirmed the news. Phoenix has been working on an album with the Charlatans' frontman, Tim Burgess. </p> <p>The move into music follows his successful turn in Walk the Line, in which Phoenix performed all of Cash's famous songs. In addition to his Oscar nomination for best actor, he won a Grammy for his work on the soundtrack.</p> <p>It's not the first time Phoenix has turned his back on acting. In the 1990s, after establishing a fledgling career as a child actor under the name Leaf, he withdrew for a time to travel to Mexico and South America with his father. Then in 1993, following the death by drug overdose of his brother River, Joaquin retreated from the public eye once again after his distraught 911 call to the police was recorded and repeatedly played over the airwaves and on television across the globe.</p> <p>On that occasion it took him a year to return to acting. This time around it looks like the break could be rather longer.</p>"
