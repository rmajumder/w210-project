  "<p><em>Ireland, near the north\u2013south border, 1981</em></p> <p>They'd stolen a march on the day. The sky was like dark glass, reluctant to let the light through. The only sound was the chudder of the van skirting the lough. The surface of the water was colourless. The hills slumped down on the far side like silhouettes of snoozing giants.</p> <p>Fergus yawned. It was still before five as they turned off up the mountain road. Uncle Tally chewed on nothing as the tyres lumbered over the ruts. Fergus cradled the flask of sweet black tea. There'd been no milk in the fridge that morning.</p> <p>\"Too early for you, huh?\" mocked Uncle Tally, changing gear.</p> <p>\"Too right,\" said Fergus. \"When I go running, it's not dark like this.\" His throat was furred up. The words came out stretched by a yawn. \"It's unnatural being up before the birds.\"</p> <p>They approached the border checkpoint and the van slowed. The soldier by the hut stood with a rifle but did not move. He was young-looking and pale, with freckles. He waved them on, tipping the butt of the gun, and they drove past without having to stop. Uncle Tally laughed. \"I could have a truckload of Semtex for all that wee squaddie cares,\" he said.</p> <p>Fergus grunted. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Deus would be delighted.\"</p> <p>Deus, Latin for \"God\", was the local nickname for a rumoured bomb-maker, said to be active thereabouts.</p> <p>\"So he would.\"</p> <p>\"Only you'd be going in the wrong direction. We\"re leaving the Troubles, Unk, not joining them.\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally thumped the wheel. \"So we are. We\"re in the free state now. Free as a bloody bog-frog.\" They both laughed like clowns. Going over the border always had that effect. Without your knowing it, your jaw-bone would stiffen and adrenalin pump through your veins as the checkpoint approached. Then, when you were through, hilarity would erupt at the relief.</p> <p>The van turned up onto a steep road with grass growing up the middle. The gorse got yellower as they climbed, the sky brighter. \"The border. Even a nun would be nervous crossing it,\" suggested Fergus.</p> <p>\"And we'll be crossing back over it at the top.\"</p> <p>\"Will we?\"</p> <p>\"If you look at the map. You can see.\"</p> <p>Fergus opened the map and saw the dotted grey line, almost invisible, meandering across Ireland's north, but leaving a thin tract of land to the west that was Donegal. \"The most northern bit of Ireland's in the south,\" he quoted.</p> <p>\"One day, one day . . .\" Uncle Tally muttered like a mantra.</p> <p>\"One day what?\"</p> <p>\"One day the only border will be the sea and the only thing guarding it the dunes and the only people living in it Republicans. One day, Fergus.\"</p> <p>\"Where will the Loyalists go, so?\"</p> <p>\"They'll be beamed to outer space, warp factor five.\" Uncle Tally drove round a loop of road, heading back to where the light was growing on the horizon. \"Lucky them. Now, here's the spot to park, Fergus. Get cracking. The JCB crew will be down on us before you know.\" He pulled up and they got out the shovels and bags from the back and walked over a track for a hundred yards. On either side, brown grass sprouted out of black, wet earth, and bright green weeds spread like mildew over the soggier areas. The first skylark of the day darted from cover. Fergus approached the JCB, which was still, abandoned. Earth was churned up all around it, the leftover diggings from the day before. But \"earth\" was the wrong word. It was turf, rich foaming peat, made from the things that had lived here in millennia gone by and pressed by time into a magic frieze of the past. You could dig up wood from primeval forests, find resin with insects of another age frozen in it. And what you dug up you could burn as fuel.</p> <p>And, as his da said, there was nothing like the smell of the turf on a hearth to bring comfort in a dark world.</p> <p>A pink tint grew on the horizon as they dug and filled the bags with uncut clumps. Dawn intensified. The sky was clear and close up here, the mind uncluttered. Uncle Tally grunted as he shovelled, his taut, fit frame enjoying the work. Fergus held the bags open for him and then they swapped over. They'd sell the bags for ninety pence and Fergus was promised a cut of thirty per cent. But the JCB crew would be arriving soon and they'd have to be well gone by then.</p> <p>A cry made Fergus swivel round. It was only a wild kid with a creamy coat, bleating at its mother fifty yards away or more.</p> <p>\"Get the flask, Fergus,\" Uncle Tally said. \"I'm parched. I'd a skinful last night.\"</p> <p>\"Did you?\"</p> <p>\"Yes. Your da and Pad McGuire. They came down to Finicule's for one. And you know how it is.\"</p> <p>\"Were you singing, Unk?\"</p> <p>\"We were so far gone we were singing \"Three Blind Mice\". I ask you. And your da couldn't get beyond See how they run. And it was only ten 't.\"</p> <p>\"I don't believe you.\"</p> <p>\"OK. Maybe not quite so wild.\"</p> <p>Fergus went to the van and found the flask of tea. He brought it over and they strolled down to an outcrop of rock and shared a capful. The rim of the sun came over the mountain. A wind picked up.</p> <p>\"Christ, it's quiet up here,\" said Uncle Tally.</p> <p>\"It'd be a strange place to live.\"</p> <p>\"You'd have to be a hermit.\"</p> <p>\"There'd be nothing to do but pray,\" said Fergus.</p> <p>\"Aye. You'd have plenary indulgences made for every last sinner by the time you died yourself. And then you'd be whisked up straight to heaven.\"</p> <p>\"You should move up here.\"</p> <p>\"I would too. Only it's a bit far.\"</p> <p>\"Far from where?\"</p> <p>\"The nearest bar.\"</p> <p>\"You could make your own distillery, Unk.\"</p> <p>\"But what would you distil?\"</p> <p>\"The prayers. What else?\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally clipped his ear. \"You\"re too sharp, Fergus McCann. Pass me the flask.\"</p> <p>After tea, they filled another ten bags. When there was no loosened turf left, Uncle Tally left the shovel prodded into the earth and they began to load the bags into the van.</p> <p>\"Not a bad haul.\"</p> <p>Fergus wandered off to the other side of the JCB. He watched the skyline and listened to morning getting under way. There was a hum of insects now, small movements of birds and, far off from the floor of the valley, the sound of the odd truck. The sun was up, white and smooth behind a whisper of cloud. The track led back to the road, and the road truncated the bog-land and headed straight to the horizon. Up here was borderland too. He was looking back into the North, but behind him was the Republic.</p> <p>\"Ferg, shake a leg,\" called Uncle Tally.</p> <p>\"Will we do another few bags?\"</p> <p>\"What time is it?\"</p> <p>Fergus looked at the watch he was minding for his older brother, Joe. \"Not seven yet.\"</p> <p>\"OK. But we've to make a fresh cut of it.\"</p> <p>A shovel apiece, they scrambled into the cut the JCB had made last thing the day before.</p> <p>\"You work that end, I'll work this. You've to ram the sharp side in straight and up in a line.\" Uncle Tally showed him how. \"Then down along.\"</p> <p>\"Like a grid?\"</p> <p>\"That's it. Once you've the first line out, it's easier.\"</p> <p>It was slower going than working with the JCB's leavings. But the smell of the fresh peat was clean and the springy consistency strangely satisfying to cut into.</p> <p>Fergus finished a good-sized grid and worked down along the cut, away from his uncle.</p> <p>\"Hiyack,\" he shouted as he brought the shovel hard down at a fresh angle. One inch from the wall of brown turf he froze. A foreign colour stopped him, a dull, tawny glint. He let the shovel topple at his side and his eyes blinked. Then he stretched out a hand to touch the surface. Maybe it was a trick of the light. Or a stone. Or\u2014</p> <p>Whatever it was was hard.</p> <p>He spat on his forefinger and wiped it. It gleamed a little, like a smile.</p> <p>A coin's edge. That was it.</p> <p>Excited, he spat on his fingertips and rubbed it again.</p> <p>No. It was bigger. A coil of metal, fashioned like a plait, chased itself round.</p> <p>And as he stared, fingers, four of them, appeared below it. They were brown and lined and tiny. The skin on them was too big for the bones, drooping slightly. They reminded him of his mother's, when she wore the extra-large Marigold rubber gloves.</p> <p>They were beautiful, poised like a pianist's getting ready to play, but only half the size of his own.</p> <p>\"Jesus.\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally, hard at work down his end of the cut, didn't hear.</p> <p>\"Unk. Jesus, Unk. Come here.\"</p> <p>\"What?\"</p> <p>\"There's something here. In the earth. A hand.\"</p> <p>\"What d\"you mean a hand?\"</p> <p>\"A tiny hand. And a bangle on it. And some cloth stuff.\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally hee-hawed. \"Hey, Ferg. It's June. Not the first of bloody April.\"</p> <p>But he came and looked where Fergus pointed.</p> <p>They stood in silence, staring at the wall of turf.</p> <p>\"Shit,\" said Uncle Tally.</p> <p>It was like a mural.</p> <p>The legs were missing.</p> <p>The side of a twisted torso covered in brown-stained cloth was visible above the hand. The shoulders, neck and head disappeared into the earth behind.</p> <p>\"It's a body,\" said Uncle Tally.</p> <p>\"Dead right it's a body,\" said Fergus.</p> <p>\"You could say dead again.\"</p> <p>\"Is it the Provos, Unk?\"</p> <p>\"The Provos?\"</p> <p>\"Is it somebody they killed?\"</p> <p>\"Why would they bother burying a child like that?\"</p> <p>Fergus realized. Of course. The tiny hand: the body of a child. \"Maybe it was an execution. A child of a traitor. Somebody who'd done the Cause a bad turn.\"</p> <p>\"Nah. That's not the Provos\" style.\" Uncle Tally put his shovel so it matched up against the torso's length.</p> <p>\"It's a girl, Unk,\" Fergus gasped. \"A poor wee girl. Look at the bangle and the dress on her.\"</p> <p>\"Mother of mercy. Let's get out of here.\"</p> <p>\"But Unk\u2014\"</p> <p>\"Look, she's dead, right?\"</p> <p>\"I know she's dead, but\u2014\"</p> <p>\"Yeah. And probably murdered, right?\"</p> <p>\"Murdered?\"</p> <p>\"So if we report it, we\"re done for the turf-cutting.\"</p> <p>\"But, Unk, if the JCB crew arrive, they'll just cut her up. Into ribbons. It's a miracle they stopped when they did. And that I saw her.\"</p> <p>\"Fergus, nobody's going to bring that child back to life.\"</p> <p>A clod of earth fell from the cut as he said that and an elbow appeared, small and leathered.</p> <p>\"Jesus Mary.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, Unk. Please.\"</p> <p>\"What d\"you want me to do, Fergus?\"</p> <p>\"Dunno.\"</p> <p>They stood still in the cut. The kid bleated from far away like it was lost. Fergus felt a tear forming. Furious, he bit his lip.</p> <p>\"It's a girl like our Theresa or Cath, Unk. We can't just leave her to get mashed up by the JCB. It's easy to miss her. She's gone all brown with being in the bog.\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally sighed. \"We\"re in the Republic, I suppose. It'd be the Gardai I'd tell. Not the RUC.\" He picked up Fergus's shovel. \"I'm heading away back along the road and over to Inchquin. If the JCB comes, you were up here bird-watching.\"</p> <p>\"Bird-watching?\"</p> <p>\"And you made a covert of the cut and just happened to spot this. Got it?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, Unk.\"</p> <p>\"I'm away to get the guards.\"</p> <p>\"OK.\"</p> <p>They loaded the shovels and last two bags of peat into the back of the van. Uncle Tally got in and wound down the window.</p> <p>\"And Fergus?\" he said.</p> <p>\"What?\"</p> <p>\"Don't touch her. Don't try to dig her out any more.\"</p> <p>\"Why not?\"</p> <p>\"Fingerprints. They'll think you\"re the murderer, stupid.\"</p> <p>\"Ha-ha.\"</p> <p>\"I'm serious.\"</p> <p>\"OK, Unk.\"</p> <p>\"And take this.\"</p> <p>\"What?\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally rooted in the glove compartment and handed Fergus some binoculars. \"Bird-watching. Right?\"</p> <p>\"Right.\"</p> <p>\"Stay away from that body.\"</p> <p>The van drove away. Fergus went back to the cut and waited above it, trying out the views through the binoculars. Half the time he stared at the magnified brown body in the bog. He could see lines on the finger-pads, as if the small girl had been alive yesterday. They looped and spooled like rivers. Some property of the bog had accentuated them. Then he noticed a grey-white bone, sticking out a fraction. It was where the JCB had cut through her lower leg. His stomach somersaulted. He whisked round and examined the view of the plain below, a great swath of County Fermanagh. But however hard he peered, he could have sworn the child behind him was staring into his back, her eyes needling his shoulder blades. He shrugged and pinched himself and looked through the binoculars to the far horizon. From up here, on the peaceful mountain, it was hard to believe that such unquiet existed amongst the people living on the plain below. Curls of smoke, swaying trees, cars flashing blue and red along the tarmac roads, all moved in silence. A sparrowhawk glided across his field of vision, swimming on a current of air, wavering. Then it swooped to earth and vanished from view. He crawled forward on the springy earth and lay flat on his stomach, spying down on the world. Behind him, the grass sighed with the sound of waiting.</p> <p>\u2022 (c) Siobhan Down. Bog Child is published by <a href=\"http://www.kidsatrandomhouse.co.uk\">Random House</a></p>",
  "<p>I wish I had a boyfriend. I wish he lived in the wardrobe on a coat hanger. Whenever I wanted, I could get him out and he'd look at me the way boys do in films, as if I'm beautiful. He wouldn't speak much, but he'd be breathing hard as he took off his leather jacket and unbuckled his jeans. He'd wear white pants and he'd be so gorgeous I'd almost faint. He'd take my clothes off too. He'd - whisper, \"Tessa, I love you. I really bloody love you. You're beautiful\" \u2013 exactly those words \u2013 as he undressed me.</p> <p>I sit up and switch on the bedside light. There's a pen, but no paper, so on the wall behind me I write, I want to feel the weight of a boy on top of me. Then I lie back down and look out at the sky. It's gone a funny colour \u2013 red and charcoal all at once, like the day is bleeding out.</p> <p>I can smell sausages. Saturday night is always sausages. There'll be mash and cabbage and onion gravy too. Dad'll have the lottery ticket and Cal will have chosen the numbers and they'll sit in front of the TV and eat dinner from trays on their laps. They'll watch The X Factor, then they'll watch Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? After that, Cal will have a bath and go to bed and Dad'll drink beer and smoke until it's late enough for him to sleep.</p> <p>He came up to see me earlier. He walked over to the window and opened the curtains. \"Look at that!\" he said as light flooded the room. There was the afternoon, the tops of the trees, the sky. He stood silhouetted against the window, his hands on his hips. He looked like a Power Ranger.</p> <p>\"If you won't talk about it, how can I help you?\" he said, and he came over and sat on the edge of my bed. I held my breath. If you do it for long enough, white lights dance in front of your eyes. He reached over and stroked my head, his fingers gently massaging my scalp.</p> <p>\"Breathe, Tessa,\" he whispered.</p> <p>Instead, I grabbed my hat from the bedside table and yanked it on right over my eyes. He went away then.</p> <p>Now he's downstairs frying sausages. I can hear the fat spitting, the slosh of gravy in the pan. I'm not sure I should be able to hear that from all the way upstairs, but nothing surprises me any more. I can hear Cal unzipping his coat now, back from buying mustard. Ten minutes ago he was given a pound and told, \"Don't talk to anyone weird.\" While he was gone, Dad stood on the back step and smoked a fag. I could hear the whisper of leaves hitting the grass at his feet. Autumn invading.</p> <p>\"Hang your coat up and go and see if Tess wants anything,\" <br>Dad says. \"There's plenty of blackberries. Make them sound - interesting.\"</p> <p>Cal has his trainers on; the air in the soles sighs as he leaps up the stairs and through my bedroom door. I pretend to be asleep, which doesn't stop him. He leans right over and whispers, \"I don't care even if you never speak to me again.\" I open one eye and find two blue ones. \"Knew you were faking,\" he says, and he grins wide and lovely. \"Dad says, do you want blackberries?\"</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>\"What shall I tell him?\"</p> <p>\"Tell him I want a baby elephant.\"</p> <p>He laughs. \"I'm gonna miss you,\" he says, and he leaves me with an open door and the draught from the stairs.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Zoey doesn't even knock, just comes in and plonks herself down on the end of the bed. She looks at me strangely, as if she hadn't expected to find me here.</p> <p>\"What're you doing?\" she says.</p> <p>\"Why?\"</p> <p>\"Don't you go downstairs any more?\"</p> <p>\"Did my dad phone you up?\"</p> <p>\"Are you in pain?\"</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>She gives me a suspicious look, then stands up and takes off her coat. She's wearing a very short red dress. It matches the handbag she's dumped on my floor.</p> <p>\"Are you going out?\" I ask her. \"Have you got a date?\"</p> <p>She shrugs, goes over to the window and looks down at the garden. She circles a finger on the glass, then she says, \"Maybe you should try and believe in God.\"</p> <p>\"Should I?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah, maybe we all should. The whole human race.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think so. I think he might be dead.\"</p> <p>She turns round to look at me. Her face is pale, like winter. Behind her shoulder, an aeroplane winks its way across the sky.</p> <p>She says, \"What's that you've written on the wall?\"</p> <p>I don't know why I let her read it. I guess I want something to happen. It's in black ink. With Zoey looking, all the words writhe like spiders. She reads it over and over. I hate it how sorry she can be for me.</p> <p>She speaks very softly. \"It's not exactly Disneyland, is it?\"</p> <p>\"Did I say it was?\"</p> <p>\"I thought that was the idea.\"</p> <p>\"Not mine.\"</p> <p>\"I think your dad's expecting you to ask for a pony, not a boyfriend.\"</p> <p>It's amazing, the sound of us laughing. Even though it hurts, I love it. Laughing with Zoey is absolutely one of my favourite things, because I know we've both got the same stupid pictures in our heads. She only has to say, \"Maybe a stud farm might be the answer,\" and we're both in hysterics.</p> <p>Zoey says, \"Are you crying?\"</p> <p>I'm not sure. I think I am. I sound like those women on the telly when their entire family gets wiped out. I sound like an animal gnawing its own foot off. Everything just floods in all at once \u2013 like how my fingers are just bones and my skin is practically see-through. Inside my left lung I can feel cells multiplying, stacking up, like ash slowly filling a vase. Soon I won't be able to breathe.</p> <p>\"It's OK if you're afraid,\" Zoey says.</p> <p>\"It's not.\"</p> <p>\"Of course it is. Whatever you feel is fine.\"</p> <p>\"Imagine it, Zoey \u2013 being terrified all the time.\"</p> <p>\"I can.\"</p> <p>But she can't. How can she possibly, when she has her whole life left? I hide under my hat again, just for a bit, because I'm going to miss breathing. And talking. And windows. I'm going to miss cake. And fish. I like fish. I like their little mouths going, open, shut, open.</p> <p>And where I'm going, you can't take anything with you.</p> <p>Zoey watches me wipe my eyes with the corner of the duvet.</p> <p>\"Do it with me,\" I say.</p> <p>She looks startled. \"Do what?\"</p> <p>\"It's on bits of paper everywhere. I'll write it out properly and you can make me do it.\"</p> <p>\"Make you do what? The thing you wrote on the wall?\"</p> <p>\"Other stuff too, but the boy thing first. You've had sex loads of times, Zoey, and I've never even been kissed.\"</p> <p>I watch my words fall into her. They land somewhere very deep.</p> <p>\"Not loads of times,\" she says eventually.</p> <p>\"Please, Zoey. Even if I beg you not to, even if I'm horrible to you, you must make me do it. I've got a whole long list of things I want to do.\"</p> <p>When she says, \"OK,\" she makes it sound easy, as if I only asked her to visit me more often.</p> <p>\"You mean it?\"</p> <p>\"I said so, didn't I?\"</p> <p>I wonder if she knows what she's letting herself in for.</p> <p>I sit up in bed and watch her fiddle about in the back of my wardrobe. I think she's got a plan. That's what's good about Zoey. She'd better hurry up though, because I'm starting to think of things like carrots. And air. And ducks. And pear trees. Velvet and silk. Lakes. I'm going to miss ice. And the sofa. And the lounge. And the way Cal loves magic tricks. And white things \u2013 milk, snow, swans.</p> <p>From the back of the wardrobe, Zoey pulls out the wrap-dress Dad bought me last month. It's still got the price on.</p> <p>\"I'll wear this,\" she says. \"You can wear mine.\" She starts to unbutton her dress.</p> <p>\"Are you taking me out?\"</p> <p>\"It's Saturday night, Tess. Ever heard of it?\"</p> <p>Of course. Of course I have.</p> <p>I haven't been vertical for hours. It makes me feel a bit strange, sort of empty and ethereal. Zoey stands in her underwear and helps me put on the red dress. It smells of her. The material is soft and clings to me.</p> <p>\"Why do you want me to wear this?\"</p> <p>\"It's good to feel like you're somebody else sometimes.\"</p> <p>\"Someone like you?\"</p> <p>She considers this. \"Maybe,\" she says. \"Maybe someone like me.\"</p> <p>When I look at myself in the mirror, it's great how different I look \u2013 big-eyed and dangerous. It's exciting, as if anything is - possible. Even my hair looks good, dramatically shaved rather than only just growing. We look at ourselves, side by side, then she steers me away from the mirror and makes me sit down on the bed. She brings my make-up basket from the dressing table and sits next to me. I concentrate on her face as she smears found- ation onto her finger and dabs at my cheeks. She's very pale and very blonde and her acne makes her look kind of savage. I've never had a spot in my life. It's the luck of the draw.</p> <p>She lines my lips and fills in the space with lipstick. She finds some mascara and tells me to look right at her. I try to imagine what it might be like to be her. I often do this, but I can never really get my head round it. When she makes me stand up in front of the mirror again, I glitter. A little like her.</p> <p>\"Where do you want to go?\" she says.</p> <p>There are loads of places. The pub. A club. A party. I want a big dark room you can barely move in, with bodies grinding close together. I want to hear a thousand songs played incredibly loud. I want to dance so fast that my hair grows long enough to - trample on. I want my voice to be thunderous above the throb of bass. I want to get so hot that I have to crunch ice in my mouth.</p> <p>\"Let's go dancing,\" I say. \"Let's go and find some boys to have sex with.\"</p> <p>\"All right.\" Zoey picks up her handbag and leads me from the bedroom.</p> <p>Dad comes out of the lounge and halfway up the stairs. He - pretends he was going to the loo, and acts all surprised to see us.</p> <p>\"You're up!\" he says. \"It's a miracle!\" And he nods grudging respect at Zoey. \"How did you manage it?\"</p> <p>Zoey smiles at the floor. \"She just needed a little incentive.\"</p> <p>\"Which is?\"</p> <p>I lean on one hip and look him right in the eye. \"Zoey's taking me pole dancing.\"</p> <p>\"Funny,\" he says.</p> <p>\"No, really.\"</p> <p>He shakes his head, runs a hand in circles over his belly. I feel sorry for him, because he doesn't know what to do.</p> <p>\"OK,\" I say. \"We're going clubbing.\"</p> <p>He looks at his watch as if that'll tell him something new.</p> <p>\"I'll look after her,\" Zoey says. She sounds so sweet and wholesome I almost believe her.</p> <p>\"No,\" he says. \"She needs to rest. A club will be smoky and loud.\"</p> <p>\"If she needs to rest, why did you phone me?\"</p> <p>\"I wanted you to talk to her, not take her away!\"</p> <p>\"Don't worry,\" she laughs. \"I'll bring her back.\"</p> <p>I can feel all the happiness sliding out of me because I know Dad's right. I'd have to sleep for a week if I went clubbing. If I use up too much energy, I always pay for it later.</p> <p>\"It's OK,\" I say. \"It doesn't matter.\"</p> <p>Zoey grabs my arm and pulls me behind her down the stairs. \"I've got my mum's car,\" she says. \"I'll bring her home by three.\"</p> <p>My dad tells her no, it's too late; he tells her to bring me back by midnight. He says it several times as Zoey gets my coat from the closet in the hall. As we go through the front door, I call goodbye, but he doesn't answer. Zoey shuts the door behind us.</p> <p>\"Midnight's OK,\" I tell her.</p> <p>She turns to me on the step. \"Listen, girl, if you're going to do this properly, you're going to have to learn to break the rules.\"</p> <p>\"I don't mind being back by midnight. He'll only worry.\"</p> <p>\"Let him \u2013 it doesn't matter. There are no consequences for someone like you!\"</p> <p>I've never thought about it like that before.</p> <p>\u2022 (c) Jenny Downham.

  "<p>The first thing you find out when yer dog learns to talk is that dogs don't got nothing much to say. </p> <p>About anything. </p> <p>\"Need a poo, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"Shut up, Manchee.\" </p> <p>\"Poo. Poo, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"I said shut it.\" </p> <p>We're walking across the wild fields south-east of town, those ones that slope down to the river and head on towards the swamp. Ben's sent me to pick him some swamp apples and he's made me take Manchee with me, even tho we all know Cillian only bought him to stay on Mayor Prentiss's good side and so suddenly here's this brand new dog as a present for my birthday last year when I never said I wanted any dog, that what I said I wanted was for Cillian to finally fix the fissionbike so I wouldn't have to walk every forsaken place in this stupid town, but oh, no, happy birthday, Todd, here's a brand new puppy, Todd, and even tho you don't want him, even tho you never asked for him, guess who has to feed him and train him and wash him and take him for walks and listen to him jabber now he's got old enough for the talking germ to set his mouth moving? Guess who? </p> <p>\"Poo,\" Manchee barks quietly to himself. \"Poo, poo, poo.\" </p> <p>\"Just have yer stupid poo and quit yapping about it.\" </p> <p>I take a switch of grass from beside the trail and I swat after him with it. I don't reach him, I don't mean to reach him, but he just laughs his little barking laugh and carries on down the trail. I follow after him, switching the switch against the grass on either side, squinting from the sun, try- ing not to think about nothing at all. </p> <p>We don't need apples from the swamp, truth to tell. Ben can buy them at Mr Phelps's store if he really wants them. Also true: going to the swamp to pick a few apples is not a job for a man cuz men are never allowed to be so idle. Now, I won't officially become a man for thirty more days. I've lived twelve years of thirteen long months each and another twelve months besides, all of which living means I'm still one month away from the big birthday. The plans are being planned, the preparayshuns prepared, it will be a party, I guess, tho I'm starting to get some strange pictures about it, all dark and too bright at the same time, but nevertheless I will become a man and picking apples in the swamp is not a job for a man or even an almost-man. </p> <p>But Ben knows he can ask me to go and he knows I'll say yes to going because the swamp is the only place any- where near Prentisstown where you can have half a break from all the Noise that men spill outta theirselves, all their clamour and clatter that never lets up, even when they sleep, men and the thoughts they don't know they think even when everyone can hear. Men and their Noise. I don't know how they do it, how they stand each other. </p> <p>Men are Noisy creachers. </p> <p>\"Squirrel!\" </p> <p>Manchee shouts and off he goes, jumping off the trail, no matter how loud I yell after him, and off I have to go, too, across the (I look round to make sure I'm alone) goddamfields cuz Cillian'll have a fit if Manchee falls down some goddamsnake hole and of course it'll be my own goddamfault even tho I never wanted the goddamdog in the goddamfirst place. </p> <p>\"Manchee! Get back here!\" </p> <p>\"Squirrel!\" </p> <p>I have to kick my way thru the grass, getting grublets stuck to my shoes. One smashes as I kick it off, leaving a green smear across my trainers, which I know from experi- ence ain't coming out. \"Manchee!\" I rage. </p> <p>\"Squirrel! Squirrel! Squirrel!\" </p> <p>He's barking round the tree and the squirrel's skittering back and forth on the tree trunk, taunting him. Come on, Whirler dog, says its Noise. Come on, come get, come on, come get. Whirler Whirler Whirler. </p> <p>\"Squirrel, Todd! Squirrel!\" </p> <p>Goddam, animals are stupid. </p> <p>I grab Manchee by the collar and hit him hard across his back leg. \"Ow, Todd? Ow?\" I hit him again. And again. \"Ow? Todd?\" </p> <p>\"Come on,\" I say, my own Noise raging so loud I can barely hear myself think, which is something I'm about to regret, you watch. </p> <p>Whirler boy, Whirler boy, thinks the squirrel at me. Come get, Whirler boy. </p> <p>\"You can eff off, too,\" I say, except I don't say \"eff\", I say what \"eff\" stands for. </p> <p>And I really, really shoulda looked round again. </p> <p>Cuz here's Aaron, right here, rising outta the grass from nowhere, rising up and smacking me cross the face, scratching my lip with his big ring, then bringing his hand back the other way, closed as a fist, catching my cheekbone but at least missing my nose because I'm falling into the grass, trying to fall away from his punch, and I let go of Manchee's collar and off he runs back to the squirrel, barking his head off, the traitor, and I hit the grass with my knees and my hands, getting grublet stains all over everything. </p> <p>And I stay there, on the ground, breathing. </p> <p>Aaron stands over me, his Noise coming at me in fragments of scripture and of his next sermon and Language, young Todd and the finding of a sacrifice and the saint chooses his path and God hears and the wash of pictures that's in everyone's Noise, of things familiar and glancing flashes of\u2013 </p> <p>What? What the forsaken\u2013? </p> <p>But up flies a loud bit of his sermon to block it out and I look up into his eyes and suddenly I don't wanna know. I can already taste the blood where his ring cut my lip and I don't wanna know. He never comes out here, men never do, they have their reasons, men do, and it's just me and my dog only ever but here he is and I don't don't don't wanna know. </p> <p>He smiles down at me, thru that beard of his, smiles down at me in the grass. </p> <p>A smiling fist. </p> <p>\"Language, young Todd,\" he says, \"binds us like prisoners on a chain. Haven't you learned anything from yer church, boy?\" And then he says his most familiar preaching. \"If one of us falls, we all fall.\" </p> <p>Yes, Aaron, I think. </p> <p>\"With yer mouth, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, Aaron,\" I say. </p> <p>\"And the effs?\" he says. \"And the geedees? Because don't think I didn't hear them as well. Your Noise reveals you. Reveals us all.\" </p> <p>Not all, I think, but at the same time I say, \"Sorry, Aaron.\" He leans down to me, his lips close to my face, and I can smell the breath that comes outta his mouth, smell the weight of it, like fingers grabbing for me. \"God hears,\" he whispers. \"God hears.\" </p> <p>And he raises a hand again and I flinch and he laughs and then he's gone, like that, heading back towards the town, taking his Noise with him. </p> <p>I'm shaking from the charge to my blood at being hit, shaking from being so fired up and so surprised and so angry and so much hating this town and the men in it that it takes me a while till I can get up and go get my dog again. What was he effing doing out here anyway? I think and I'm so hacked off, still so raging with anger and hate (and fear, yes, fear, shut up) that I don't even look round to see if Aaron heard my Noise. I don't look round. I don't look round. And then I do look round and I go and get my dog. </p> <p>\"Aaron, Todd? Aaron?\" </p> <p>\"Don't say that name again, Manchee.\" </p> <p>\"Bleeding, Todd. Todd? Todd? Todd? Bleeding?\" </p> <p>\"I know. Shut up.\" </p> <p>\"Whirler,\" he says, as if it don't mean nothing, his head as empty as the sky. </p> <p>I smack his rump. \"Don't say that neither.\" </p> <p>\"Ow? Todd?\" </p> <p>We keep on walking, staying clear of the river on our left. It runs down thru a series of gulches at the east of town, starting way up to the north past our farm and coming down the side of the town till it flattens out into a marshy part that eventually becomes the swamp. You have to avoid the river and especially that marshy part before the swamp trees start cuz that's where the crocs live, easily big enough to kill an almost-man and his dog. The sails on their backs look just like a row of rushes and if you get too close, WHOOM! \u2013 outta the water they come, flying at you with their claws grasping and their mouths snapping and you pretty much ain't got no chance at all then. </p> <p>We get ourselves down past the marshy part and I try to take in the swamp quiet as it approaches. There's nothing to see down here no more, really, which is why men don't come. And the smell, too, I don't pretend it don't smell, but it don't smell nearly so bad as men make out. They're smelling their memories, they are, they're not smelling what's really here, they're smelling it like it was then. All the dead things. Spacks and men had different ideas for burial. Spacks just used the swamp, threw their dead right into the water, let 'em sink, which was fine cuz they were suited for swamp burial, I guess. That's what Ben says. Water and muck and Spackle skin worked fine together, didn't poison nothing, just made the swamp richer, like men do to soil. </p> <p>Then suddenly, of course, there were a whole lot more spacks to bury than normal, too many for even a swamp this big to swallow, and it's a ruddy big swamp, too. And then there were no live spacks at all, were there? Just spack bodies in heaps, piling up in the swamp and rotting and stinking and it took a long time for the swamp to become swamp again and not just a mess of flies and smells and who knows what extra germs they'd kept saved up for us. </p> <p>I was born into all that, all that mess, the over-crowded swamp and the over-crowded sematary and the not- crowded-enough town, so I don't remember nothing, don't remember a world without Noise. My pa died of sickness before I was born and then my ma died, of course, no sur- prises there. Ben and Cillian took me in, raised me. Ben says my ma was the last of the women but everyone says that about everyone's ma. Ben may not be lying, he believes it's true, but who knows? </p> <p>I am the youngest of the whole town, tho. I used to come out and throw rocks at field crows with Reg Oliver (seven months and 8 days older) and Liam Smith (four months and 29 days older) and Seb Mundy who was next youngest to me, three months and a day older, but even he don't talk to me no more now that he's a man. </p> <p>No boys do once they turn thirteen. </p> <p>Which is how it goes in Prentisstown. Boys become men and they go to their men-only meetings to talk about who knows what and boys most definitely ain't allowed and if yer the last boy in town, you just have to wait, all by yerself. </p> <p>Well, you and a dog you don't want. </p> <p>But never mind, here's the swamp and in we go, sticking to the paths that take us round and over the worst of the water, weaving our way round the big, bulby trees that grow up and outta the bog to the needly roof, metres and metres up. The air's thick and it's dark and it's heavy, but it's not a frightening kind of thick and dark and heavy. There's lots of life here, loads of it, just ignoring the town as you please, birds and green snakes and frogs and kivits and both kinds of squirrel and (I promise you) a cassor or two and sure there's red snakes to watch out for but even tho it's dark, there's slashes of light that come down from holes in the roof and if you ask me, which you may not be, I grant you that, to me the swamp's like one big, comfy, not very Noisy room. Dark but living, living but friendly, friendly but not grasping. </p> <p>Manchee lifts his leg on practically everything till he must be running outta pee and then he heads off under a bush, burbling to himself, finding a place to do his other business, I guess. </p> <p>But the swamp don't mind. How could it? It's all just life, going over itself, returning and cycling and eating itself to grow. I mean, it's not that it's not Noisy here. Sure it is, there's no escaping Noise, not nowhere at all, but it's qui- eter than the town. The loud is a different kind of loud, because swamp loud is just curiosity, creachers figuring out who you are and if yer a threat. Whereas the town knows all about you already and wants to know more and wants to beat you with what it knows till how can you have any of yerself left at all? </p> <p>Swamp Noise, tho, swamp Noise is just the birds all thinking their worrisome little birdie thoughts. Where's food? Where's home? Where's my safety? And the waxy squirrels, which are all little punks, teasing you if they see you, teasing themselves if they don't, and the rusty squirrels, which are like dumb little kids, and some- times there's swamp foxes out in the leaves who you can hear faking their Noise to sound like the squirrels they eat and even less often there are mavens singing their weird maven songs and once I swear I saw a cassor running away on two long legs but Ben says I didn't, says the cassors are long gone from the swamp. </p> <p>I don't know. I believe me. </p> <p>Manchee comes outta the bushes and sits down next to me cuz I've stopped right there in the middle of a trail. He looks around to see what I might be seeing and then he says, \"Good poo, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"I'm sure it was, Manchee.\" </p> <p>I'd better not get another ruddy dog when my birthday comes. What I want this year is a hunting knife like the one Ben carries on the back of his belt. Now that's a present for a man. </p> <p>\"Poo,\" Manchee says quietly. </p> <p>On we walk. The main bunch of apple trees are a little ways into the swamp, down a few paths and over a fallen log that Manchee always needs help over. When we get there, I pick him up around his stomach and lift him to the top. Even tho he knows what I'm doing, he still kicks his legs all over the place like a falling spider, making a fuss for no reason at all. </p> <p>\"Hold still, you gonk!\" </p> <p>\"Down, down, down!\" he yelps, scrabbling away at the air. </p> <p>\"Idiot dog.\" </p> <p>I plop him on top the log and climb up myself. We both jump down to the other side, Manchee barking \"Jump!\" as he lands and keeping on barking \"Jump!\" as he runs off. </p> <p>The leap over the log is where the dark of the swamp really starts and the first thing you see are the old Spackle buildings, leaning out towards you from shadow, looking like melting blobs of tan-coloured ice cream except hut-sized. No one knows or can remember what they were ever sposed to be but best guess by Ben, who's a best guess kinda guy, is that they had something to do with burying their dead. Maybe even some kind of church, even tho the spacks didn't have no kind of religion anyone from Prentisstown could reckernize. </p> <p>I keep a wide distance from them and go into the little grove of wild apple trees. The apples are ripe, nearly black, almost edible, as Cillian would say. I pick one off the trunk and take a bite, the juice dribbling down my chin. </p> <p>\"Todd?\" </p> <p>\"What, Manchee?\" I take out the plastic bag I've got folded in my back pocket and start filling it with apples. </p> <p>\"Todd?\" he barks again and this time I notice how he's barking it and I turn and he's pointed at the Spackle build- ings and his fur's all ridged up on his back and his ears are flicking all over the place. </p> <p>I stand up straight. \"What is it, boy?\" </p> <p>He's growling now, his lips pulled back over his teeth. I feel the charge in my blood again. \"Is it a croc?\" I say. </p> <p>\"Quiet, Todd,\" Manchee growls. </p> <p>\"But what is it?\" </p> <p>\"Is quiet, Todd.\" He lets out a little bark and it's a real bark, a real dog bark that means nothing but \"Bark!\" and my body electricity goes up a bit, like charges are going to start leaping outta my skin. \"Listen,\" he growls. </p> <p>And so I listen. </p> <p>And I listen. </p> <p>And I turn my head a little and I listen some more. </p> <p>There's a hole in the Noise. </p> <p>Which can't be. </p> <p>It's weird, it is, out there, hiding somewhere, in the trees or somewhere outta sight, a spot where your ears and your mind are telling you there's no Noise. It's like a shape you can't see except by how everything else around it is touch- ing it. Like water in the shape of a cup, but with no cup. It's a hole and everything that falls into it stops being Noise, stops being anything, just stops altogether. It's not like the quiet of the swamp, which is never quiet obviously, just less Noisy. But this, this is a shape, a shape of nothing, a hole where all Noise stops. </p> <p>Which is impossible. </p> <p>There ain't nothing but Noise in this world, nothing but the constant thoughts of men and things coming at you and at you and at you, ever since the spacks released the Noise germ during the war, the germ that killed half the men and every single woman, my ma not excepted, the germ that drove the rest of the men mad, the germ that spelled the end for all Spackle once men's madness picked up a gun. </p> <p>\"Todd?\" Manchee's spooked, I can hear it. \"What, Todd? </p> <p>What's it, Todd?\" </p> <p>\"Can you smell anything?\" </p> <p>\"Just smell quiet, Todd,\" he barks, then he starts barking louder, \"Quiet! Quiet!\" </p> <p>And then, somewhere around the spack buildings, the quiet moves. </p> <p>My blood-charge leaps so hard it about knocks me over. Manchee yelps in a circle around me, barking and barking, making me double-spooked, and so I smack him on the rump again (\"Ow, Todd?\") to make myself calm down. \"There's no such thing as holes,\" I say. \"No such thing as nothing. So it's gotta be a something, don't it?\" </p> <p>\"Something, Todd,\" Manchee barks. </p> <p>\"Can you hear where it went?\" </p> <p>\"It's quiet, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"You know what I mean.\" </p> <p>Manchee sniffs the air and takes one step, two, then more towards the Spackle buildings. I guess we're looking for it, then. I start walking all slow-like up to the biggest of the melty ice cream scoops. I stay outta the way of anything that might be looking out the little bendy triangle doorway. Manchee's sniffing at the door frame but he's not growling so I take a deep breath and I look inside. </p> <p>It's dead empty. The ceiling rises up to a point about another length of me above my head. Floor's dirt, swamp plants growing in it now, vines and suchlike, but nothing else. Which is to say no real nothing, no hole, and no telling what mighta been here before. </p> <p>It's stupid but I gotta say it. </p> <p>I'm wondering if the Spackle are back. </p> <p>But that's impossible. </p> <p>But a hole in the Noise is impossible. </p> <p>So something impossible has to be true. </p> <p>I can hear Manchee snuffling around again outside so I creep out and I go to the second scoop. There's writing on the outside of this one, the only written words anyone's ever seen in the spack language. The only words they ever saw fit to write down, I guess. The letters are spack letters, but Ben says they make the sound es'Paqili or suchlike, es'Paqili, the Spackle, \"spacks\" if you wanna spit it, which since what happened happened is what everyone does. Means \"The People\". </p> <p>There's nothing in the second scoop neither. I step back out into the swamp and I listen again. I put my head down and I listen and I reach with the hearing parts of my brain and I listen there, too, and I listen and listen. </p> <p>I listen. </p> <p>\"Quiet! Quiet!\" Manchee barks, twice real fast and peels off running again, towards the last scoop. I take off after him, running myself, my blood charging, cuz that's where it is, that's where the hole in the Noise is. I can hear it. </p> <p>Well, I can't hearit, that's the whole point, but when I run towards it the emptiness of it is touching my chest and the stillness of it pulls at me and there's so much quiet in it, no, not quiet, silence, so much unbelievable silence that I start to feel really torn up, like I'm about to lose the most valuable thing ever, like there it is, a death, and I'm running and my eyes are watering and my chest is just crushing and there's no one to see but I still mind and my eyes start crying, they start crying, they start effing crying, and I stop for a minute and I bend over and Jesus H Dammit, you can just shut up right now, but I waste a whole stupid minute, just a whole stinking, stupid minute bent over there, by which time, of course, the hole is moving away, it's moved away, it's gone. </p> <p>Manchee's torn twixt racing after it and coming back to me but he finally comes back to me. </p> <p>\"Crying, Todd?\" </p> <p>\"Shut up,\" I say and aim a kick at him. It misses on purpose.</p> <p>\u2022 (c) Patrick Ness 2008. Extracted from The Knife of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness. Reproduced by permission of Walker Books Ltd, London SE11 5HJ</p>",
  "<p>In late July, Jay Babcock, editor of Los Angeles-based counterculture magazine Arthur, announced he'd finally had his fill of the city of angels. \"LA is a psychic death hole to me,\" he told the Los Angeles Times from his new home in Brooklyn. \"There are so many impending crises \u2014 the political structure, the traffic, the educational system\u2026 culture in LA is in a race to the bottom, and all the smart and creative people there are involved in new ways to do social networking or figure out what YouTube video is going to get the most views. That isn't culture, it's pure pandering.\" Babcock's comments caused the predictable comment-box controversy, and he'd later claim hiscomments were taken out of context, but in many ways, his slam seemed to confirm what people outside of Los Angeles thought of LA: a cultural desert, patrolled by Arnie's stormtroopers, peopled by bloodless Hollywood agents, cocktail waitresses and permed rockers who fell into creative limbo the day Axl Rose declared he was recording an album called Chinese Democracy, and never snapped out of it.</p> <p>Dean Spunt, though, isn't having any of it. \"Los Angeles is amazing right now,\" he says. \"There's no hair metal \u2014 just people trying to be actors and awesome Mexican kids from East LA and Compton going to shows with white kids from the suburbs. Right now, there's a unity in the LA scene where people can exist together no matter where they come from.\" Spunt is the singer/drummer for No Age, a dreamy Los Angeles punk duo who signed to Sub Pop last year after a bidding war, and his band represents a side of LA you won't have seen in The Hills, Entourage, or those creepy adverts where Governor Arnie and friends try to persuade you to visit California with all the tight-faced charms of a T-1000 holding a gun to your temple. </p> <p>No Age were born out of The Smell, a small all-ages punk venue in the Gallery District, just off the old homeless district of Skid Row. \"It's where a lot of friends play and work, kids from different suburbs trying out new ideas,\" says Spunt's No Age bandmate, guitarist Randy Randall. \"There's quite a communal vibe \u2014 you know, it's run by volunteers who'll come down to stamp hands, or run the vegan snack bar, or go 'Hey, I made pizza tonight!' and sell it. Jim [Smith, Smell founder] will call me and go, 'hey someone fell through, can you come do sound tonight?' And if I've got time I'll go down.\" That's where similarities to your local community centre ends, though: The Smell's most recent crop of post-No Age bands \u2014 the likes of HEALTH, Mika Miko, Abe Vigoda, and the Mae Shi \u2014 have seen it talked up as one of the most fertile hotbeds in US rock since Brooklyn turned into a factory line for trust fund bands trying to follow the Strokes to superstardom. The kids that cluster at The Smell are arguably descendants of the LA punk bands that ruled the city in the 1980s, with their skateboards, wallet chains and hand-scrawled flyers, but the music they make isn't so easily pigeonholed. \"You can be here any different night and see 10 different styles of music,\" says Randall. Scuzzy guitars and pounding drums meet tropical rhythms, ear-blistering noise and zonked DIY psychedelia. \"The bands all sound different, adds Spunt. But the spirit is the same.\"</p> <p>LA's sprawling geography means The Smell \u2014 and similar small venues and gallery spaces like Pherspace and Tiny Creatures \u2014 aren't just a place to drop in, but a beacon of inspiration for like-minded kids from the distant suburbs. \"We're always categorised as an LA band or a Smell band but at the same time we used to drive 40 minutes to go to the Smell, to hang out with our friends,\" says Juan Velazquez, singer/guitarist of tropical-tinged punks Abe Vigoda, who was born in Mexico, but grew up in Chino, east of LA in the Inland Empire. \"Los Angeles doesn't have that DIY punk reputation in the way that New York has, or Baltimore has \u2014 no one ever thinks of it as an art place, like, something weird can come from there. So it's kinda cool that people are beginning to recognise that stuff that's always been bubbling under.\"</p> <p>Just as Los Angeles rock music seemed to get stuck in the poodlepermed 1980s and never quite let go, so too does the spirit of gangsta rap hang over the city, long after its hip-hop crown was snatched back, first by New York, then the syrupsipping rappers of the Dirty South. Steve Ellington, aka Los Angeles hip-hop producer Flying Lotus, certainly remembers it fondly. \"Doggystyle, man,\" he coos.</p> <p>\"Snoop Doggy Dogg in '93. That album was the soundtrack to my life when I was a kid. Those beats sound like the city. When it came to finding an MC to rap over his early beats, it wouldn't quite work. \"They'd be like, saying shit and I'll be, 'I wasn't thinking that when I made the beat'. My tracks are like my little children and if someone comes out all 'I'm gonna kill this motherfucker, shoot this bitch!' I'm like, peace man, hippy vibes\u2026\" His second album, Los Angeles, is hip-hop with heatstroke, all beats that drop slightly out of kilter and synths that shimmer as if viewed across a hot car park \u2014 but it's just the tip of a new generation of woozy instrumental hip-hop from producers like Samiyam, Ras G, and The Gaslamp Killer that take an eclectic approach to influence, cutting up wobbly synths, slamming beats, and hemp-puffing 1970s psychedelia with reckless abandon. \"It's like jazz cats back in the day,\" explains Ellington. \"They were all inspired by each other. It's like a community thing, not competition, just inspiration\u2026 it's competing with self.\"</p> <p>The great nephew of Alice Coltrane, Ellington has certainly picked up something of that cosmic vibe. \"You calling me a hippy?' he grins. \"Sure, a lot of my friends are hippies \u2014 on that beatnik vibe. You know, there's so much going on right now, we're in this weird transitional thing with the economy and the war. It's that sort of time where people feel like they wanna get on a soapbox and shout from the rooftops.\"</p> <p>Flying Lotus' music, and the music arising from The Smell isn't political per se, but they share a hazy sort of positivity: the feeling that the world might be all screwed up, but if you keep your friends close, everything will be OK. \"One of the reason I like LA is that this scene can exist, and my friends, everyone's got the same mentality, but then you can be sitting next to somebody who's pushing their screenplay, or they're yelling at their assistant,\" laughs Juan from Abe Vigoda. \"But it's kind of cool those things can exist together. And it's cool that people are now focusing on LA for good reasons. You know, instead of hair metal. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> No Age's Nouns, Abe Vigoda's Skeleton and Flying Lotus' Los Angeles are out now</p> <h2>The LA takers</h2> <p><strong>No Age</strong><br><strong>Who</strong>: Randy Randall and Dean Spunt, founding fathers of the new LA punk scene, blending the scuzz and tempo of 1980s hardcore with the warm shoegaze throb of My Bloody Valentine.</p> <p><strong>Flying Lotus</strong><br><strong>Who</strong>: Woozy, jazz-tinged instrumental hip-hop producer from Winnetka in the Los Angeles suburbs.

  "<p>It was late afternoon in the south of France when we settled down to lunch. The pine trees were throbbing with cicadas and the countryside was alive with sharp summer light. There was only one wine to order, a bottle of crisp, cold ros\u00e9, which rattled to the table in a silver ice bucket wearing a white napkin around its neck. </p> <p>I was seduced, bewitched by the magical pink colour, and completely unaware that my life was about to change for ever. Within months I had taken up a bet to find the palest ros\u00e9 in France, and within a year I was trying to set up France's first ros\u00e9 bar, until I finally settled for selling pink wine in the Proven\u00e7al markets.</p> <p>What was it about ros\u00e9 that managed to convince me, an otherwise sensible city lawyer, to give up his career and devote his life to a wine that most experts view as insignificant? </p> <p>To me, ros\u00e9 is the perfect antidote to modern life. It offers instant access to frivolity in an otherwise serious world. When presented with a glass of ros\u00e9, not even the most verbose wine buff sits around pontificating about aromas of freshly mown grass or sawn wood. </p> <p>To drink a glass of pink wine is to indulge in escapism, to transport oneself to a sleepy sun-drenched world, where boules clack in the late afternoon shadows and where there's nothing but a swim to squeeze in before supper. </p> <p>It's no surprise that every day more and more fingers trace their way down wine lists and alight on an alluring bottle of pink. Responding to consumer demand, vineyards across the world are switching production from white and red to ros\u00e9, and a couple of months ago it was announced that the French are now drinking more ros\u00e9 than white.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I meander from producer to producer tasting their latest offerings and stocking up on cases of wine to sell in the Proven\u00e7al markets. Which brings me to the final quality of ros\u00e9 - it can be quite inspirational, particularly for anyone considering a career change.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jamie Ivy's Ros\u00e9 en March\u00e9 is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (\u00a312.99).

  "<p>Baltimore - it's been an ordinary week in Maryland's largest city. The August heat broke and one can nearly sleep with a window open; the Orioles are again down in the cellar in the American League East; the city murder rate is a bit behind last year's blood-letting, and if it holds into the fall, politicians and police commanders will compete to claim credit.</p> <p>The stories in the Baltimore Sun remain fixed on the surface, each of them premised on the givens: schools will open next week and provide more or less the same inferior education as previous years; Johns Hopkins is building its biotech park expansion where the East Baltimore ghetto used to be and the ghetto is migrating due east and north-east; the biotech park will be great for white folk with college degrees, for those with union cards, the factories are still closed and the port is still losing cargo to Norfolk; a shooting here, a cutting there ...</p> <p>All in all, an unremarkable summer.</p> <p>Save for one lonely headline the other day - something that genuinely intrigues. It's a curious item - a draft report by a local non-profit foundation, a simple statistical study of the difference between Baltimore criminal juries and those of the surrounding, suburban counties.</p> <p>It seems that in Baltimore, one of the most violent cities in America, jurors are far more reluctant to convict criminal defendants than in the suburban enclaves that ring the city.</p> <p>The report upset the city's chief prosecutor; she thought its conclusions \"politically divisive\" and asked the foundation to either amend the draft study or kill it entirely. The press mocked her for this, of course, and rightly so, while on the radio here, white talk-show hosts had fun speculating about why city jurors - read \"black people\" - won't do their civic duty when it is, in fact, their communities that are so overwhelmed by crime.</p> <p>Everyone had something to say for a day or two, and of course, after that brief span of time, the entire issue disappeared into the glowing mediafest that was Michael Phelps and his remarkable collection of gold medals. Phelps is from Baltimore, by the way. As he is not wrapped in crime-scene tape, hampered by a budget shortfall or unable to raise his standardised test scores to the national average, we claim the great Olympian with considerable pride. The boy can swim, yes he can.</p> <p>In any event, the story about the reluctant city juries slipped quickly below the waves in the Beijing pool without anyone ever seriously inquiring into the why of it, much less attempting to do any actual reporting on the matter.</p> <p>Anomaly noted. Half-assed speculation offered. On to new business.</p> <p>But here's the thing of which we can all be certain, the thing that fuels all the dramatic arcs of The Wire, in fact: the why is the only thing that actually matters. The who, the what, the when, the where, even the how - every other building block in which journalists and policy planners and political leaders routinely trade - amount to nothing beyond the filler, interchangeable with the facts flung a year ago, a year from now and decades hence.</p> <p>The why is it. The why is what makes journalism an adult game. The why is what makes policy coherent and useful. The why is what transforms bureaucrats and foot soldiers and political leaders into viable instruments of rational and affirmative change. The why is everything and without it, the very suggestion of human progress becomes a cosmic joke.</p> <p>And in the American city, at the millennium, the why has ceased to exist.</p> <p>When I read reviews and commentary on The Wire in the British press, I am usually moved to a peculiar and conflicted place. I'm gratified by the incredible amount of verbiage accorded our little drama and I'm delighted to have the fundamental ideas and arguments of the piece discussed seriously.</p> <p>But at the same time, I'm acutely aware that our dystopian depiction of Baltimore has more appeal the farther one travels from America. The Wire is, of course, dissent of a kind and it is true that there are many of my countrymen who are in fundamental disagreement with the manner in which the nation is being governed and managed. But somehow, it sounds better to my ear when it's my own people talking trash and calling our problems out.</p> <p>At the same time, it's not just a question of standing, but of nuance as well. I get that we've been the bull in the china shop internationally, that we've been arrogant and tone-deaf in so many arenas for so many years, and now, with the margins of the American empire being pressed, everyone is ready to embrace the requisite number of I-told-you-so moments. Fair enough. We had it coming. But the emotion in all of that sometimes leads the overseas commentary about Baltimore and The Wire toward something that I don't recognise as accurate.</p> <p>Baltimore is not the inner circle of hell. It is not entirely devoured by a drug economy that serves as its last viable industry. It is not a place in which gangsters routinely fire clip after clip, spraying the streets in daylight ambushes. It is not unlivable, or devoid of humanity, or a reservoir of unmitigated human despair.</p> <p>I live in Baltimore, in a neighbourhood that is none of these things. I am vested in the city and its future and I can drive you to places in this city that would transform even the most devout Wire fan into a fat, happy tourist. Baltimore's charms are no less plentiful than most American cities.</p> <p>And yet there are places in Baltimore where The Wire is not at all hyperbole, where all of the depicted tragedy and waste and dysfunction are fixed, certain and constant. And that place is, I might add, about 20 blocks from where I live.</p> <p>That is the context of The Wire and that is the only context in which Baltimore - and by reasonable extension, urban America - can be fairly regarded. There are two Americas - separate, unequal, and no longer even acknowledging each other except on the barest cultural terms. In the one nation, new millionaires are minted every day. In the other, human beings no longer necessary to our economy, to our society, are being devalued and destroyed. Both things are true, and one gets a sense, reading the distant reaction to The Wire, that Europeans are far more ready to be convinced by one vision than the other.</p> <p>I used to quote Churchill as declaring that a first-rate mind was one that could maintain two opposing ideas at the same time. It certainly sounded Churchillian to me until someone better read pointed out that this notable quote is by F Scott Fitzgerald.</p> <p>At first this disappoints, because the quote, to me, seems to argue for political nuance, for subtlety and precision in state affairs. For a long while, the literary origin of the credo made no sense.</p> <p>But then, The Wire.</p> <p>As with Fitzgerald, we were selling story only. And at all points, when filming our drama, we understood that we were arguing the case of one America to the other. We were not saying everything, showing everything. We focused on the urban dynamic of drugs, crime and race. We argued the fraud of the drug war and offered an elegy for the death of union labour and the working class. We ruminated on the political infrastructure and its inability to reform. We picked a fight over the decline of public education and the lie behind our national claim to equality of opportunity. And lastly, we suggested that in the end, no one in our media culture is paying attention or asking hard questions.</p> <p>We did not contemplate immigration. We largely ignored sex-based discrimination, feminism and gender issues. We spoke not a word about the pyramid scheme that is the mortgage crisis, or the diminishing consumer class, or the time bomb that all of our China-bought debt might prove to be. Nor did we glory in the healthy sectors of the American economy, in the growth industries of the information age. We did not embrace Brooklyn Heights and West Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Marin County. Hell, we didn't even rest for more than a day or two in Roland Park or Mount Washington or Towson - those Baltimore neighbourhoods that define a viable, monied America. We spoke to the other part of town, the forgotten place, the one they don't tell many stories about, at least not in the medium of entertainment television. It was a story rooted in truth, but it wasn't the only story or the only truth. Who, but a second-rate mind, would claim otherwise?</p> <p>Yet in my country, they actually argue the point. While British audiences might believe The Wire to represent more than it does, Americans - many of them, at least - are quick to argue that it doesn't represent everything and is therefore, somehow, not representative of anything at all.</p> <p>Was the Wire myopic? Should it have been allowed to dwell for five seasons on that in America which is broken and brutal? Was it not obliged, as an act of journalistic equanimity, if not dramatic power, to display portions of the America where human lives are not marginalised and discarded?</p> <p>Well, there are about 350 television shows about the affluent America, the comfortable America, the viable and cohesive nation where everyone gets what they want if they either work hard or know someone or have a pretty face or cheat like hell. That America is available every night, on every channel in the Comcast package.</p> <p>For a brief time, there was one television drama about the other America.</p> <p>Are we really going to debate whether it was one too many?</p> <p>Which brings us back to this week in Baltimore and that jury report, the one that everyone had something to say about, but no one actually bothered to analyse. The draft study, which tracked jury trials in Baltimore over a one-year period from July 2005, found that jurors in surrounding, predominantly white suburban counties were 30 times more likely to convict defendants of the most serious charge. Overall in the surrounding counties, the acquittal rate was 27%. In the city, it was 43%. And the disinclination of Baltimore juries to convict drug defendants on serious charges was even more pronounced, according to the Baltimore Sun.</p> <p>The Sun's coverage indicated that the report's author had speculated vaguely as to \"population characteristics and socioeconomic factors\" being relevant to the statistical variance. The Sun itself provided no additional analysis, reportage, thought or speculation as to why city juries behave as they do.</p> <p>Again, the why of the thing. The only part that really matters.</p> <p>Because in my city, we have fought the drug war to the very end of the line, with sergeants becoming lieutenants and majors becoming colonels and city mayors becoming state governors. We have done so for decades, one day into the next, one administration after another, each claiming progress and measuring such in arrest rates, drug seizures, crime stats. And no one asks: why?</p> <p>No one asks why, with all the arrests and seizures, the availability and purity of narcotics and cocaine has actually increased over the past three decades. No one asks why, with all the law enforcement committed, whole tracts of the city have nonetheless degenerated into free-fire war zones. No one asks why police commanders are routinely able to reduce the rates of robbery, or rape, or assault significantly in any time period prior to an election, while the murder rate - in which the victim can't be obscured or clerically \"unfounded\" - stays as high as ever. And now, this week, no one asks why men and women from Baltimore, upon being given a chance to strike a blow against disorder and mayhem by convicting those charged criminally, would shirk their responsibility.</p> <p>Well, here it is, plain as day...</p> <p>In order to elect Baltimore's mayor as Maryland's governor, crime had to go down. And when that mayor was unable to do so legitimately, through a meaningful deterrent, his police officials did not merely go about cooking their statistics, making robberies and assaults disappear by corrupting the reporting of such incidents, they resorted to something far more disturbing.</p> <p>For the last years of his administration, Mayor Martin O'Malley ordered the mass arrests of citizens in every struggling Baltimore neighbourhood, from eastside to west. More than 100,000 bodies were dragged to Central Booking in a single year - record rates of arrest for a city with fewer than 700,000 residents. Corner boys, touts, drug slingers, petty criminals - yes, they went in the wagons.</p> <p>But school teachers, city workers, shopkeepers, delivery boys - they too were jacked up, cuffed and hauled down to Eager Street - hundreds of them a night on the weekends. Some were charged, but few were prosecuted. And in 25,000 such cases, they were later freed from the detention facility without ever going to court; no charges were proffered because, well, no crime had been committed.</p> <p>I wasn't arrested. Nor was Ed Burns or Dominic West or Aidan Gillen. Nor were my neighbours or the Baltimore Sun's editors or the members of the Maryland Club. But then, we're all white. Among the black members of my cast and crew, it was often impossible to drive from the film set to home at night without being stopped - and in some cases detained or arrested - on nonexistent probable cause and nonexistent charges. The crackdown came wholly in black neighbourhoods and it landed wholly on the backs of black citizens.</p> <p>And now, just a few years later, comes this document that causes the state's attorney to deny the obvious and leaves everyone else wondering weakly and vaguely as to the why of it. Is it so hard to understand that the same people who had their civil rights cleanly dispatched, who spent nights in jail because police officers lied on them and dragged them off without charge - that these people might be inclined to disbelieve the word of law enforcement in any future criminal case?</p> <p>In places like West Baltimore, the drug war destroyed every last thing that the drugs themselves left standing - including the credibility of the police deterrent. To elect one man to higher office, an entire city alienated its citizenry and destroyed its juror pool.</p> <p>Mayor O'Malley is now Governor O'Malley. The police commanders have all been promoted. A daily newspaper that had no stomach for addressing the why a decade ago when it had 400 editors and reporters, a newspaper more consumed with prize submissions and gotcha stories than with complex analysis of its city's problems, now has 220 bodies in its newsroom and is even less capable of the task. And nothing, of course, changes.</p> <p>Yes, such a scenario is grist for The Wire. We could have easily built half a season out of the collapse of the Baltimore jury pool and the inability of city prosecutors to bring cases into court.</p> <p>Yet there is also something appalling in the suggestion that a television drama - a presumed entertainment - might be a focal point for a discussion of what has gone wrong in urban America, for why we have become a society that no longer even recognises the depth of our problems, much less works to solve any of them.</p> <p>But where else is the why even being argued any more? Not in the stunted political discourse of an American election cycle, not in an eviscerated, self-absorbed press, not in any construct to which the empowered America, the comfortable and comforted America, gives its limited attention. To know why city juries won't participate in the drug war any more, to know why they have opted out of our collective dysfunction, you'd have to travel to the other America - to West Fayette Street or Park Heights Avenue or East Madison Street or any other of the forgotten places. And, well, as has already been said, we are separate nations at this point. Few of us ever cross the frontier to hear voices different from our own. \u00b7</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A newspaperman for 13 years, David Simon is the author of Homicide: A Year On The Killing Streets, published in the UK by Canongate, as well as an executive producer and writer of HBO's The Wire.</p>",

  "<p><strong>What exactly is a Master of Wine?</strong> An MW, of which there are about 250 in the world, is a wine-loving masochist who has submitted themselves to the rigours of the annual theory and practical exams (36 wines served blind over three sessions) held every May in the UK, US and Australia; finally managed to pass all of them (the pass rate is relatively low); and then managed to write a dissertation that is accepted. Then, and only then, can you call yourself a Master of Wine. The Institute of MWs was founded in London in the early 1950s.</p> <p><strong>What made you want to become MW?</strong> I took the exams in 1984, the first year that they allowed people like me outside the wine trade to do so, and because I had done well in the exams leading up to Master of Wine, I was heavily pressured to have a shot. I also tend to respond to challenges. </p> <p><strong>When and how did you first become interested in wine?</strong> I was first exposed to wine at Oxford and realised that it could be as stimulating intellectually as sensually. I didn't really learn about it formally until I was, miraculously, taken on as assistant editor of a wine trade magazine in 1975. </p> <p><strong>What is the best bottle you have ever tasted?</strong> Wine varies from individual bottle to individual bottle. Cheval Blanc 1947 is a famous wine that I have been lucky enough to taste quite a few times, and the best bottle I have ever had was served to me by Phillip Schofield, who is a great wine connoisseur.</p> <p><strong>And are you saving any bottle for a special occasion?</strong> I think too much wine is saved for a special occasion. Corks are for pulling. </p> <p><strong>Do you have a favourite tasting term?</strong> I think I probably have several quirky tasting notes. One of them is \"confident\". Sometimes a wine just seems so well balanced, expressive and sure of itself that I describe it as confident.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever sent wine back in a restaurant? </strong>Yes, but only in extremis. More often I ask for an ice bucket to cool down a red that's a bit too warm. </p> <p><strong>Is there an optimum price for a bottle of wine?</strong> I think the best value is generally to be found between about \u00a37 and \u00a314.</p> <p><strong>Is there ever a day when you don't really feel like having any wine?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>What would you drink instead?</strong> Even I have to admit that water is a damned fine drink. </p> <p><strong>What advice would you give readers who want to learn more about wine beyond our guides?</strong> Or <a href=\"http://www.JancisRobinson.com\">JancisRobinson.com</a>?!

  "<p>Is it over? Was that the oil shock? Can we relax, sit back and expect our energy bills and prices at the pumps to tumble? It is true that the price of oil is down. In early July, the price peaked at $147 a barrel. Yesterday it hit $106. A fall of almost 30% in two months suggests the old rule that \"nothing cures high prices like high prices\" may finally be working in the oil market.</p> <p>Americans used less in their cars over the summer: demand in the US fell by 800,000 barrels a day in the first half of this year, the largest decline for 26 years. In the UK, Ryanair is grounding more planes this winter. The global economy is slowing - even China, the biggest source of new demand, may soon be feeling colder breezes. But what's this? Leading members of Opec, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, want to reduce oil supplies to keep the price high.</p> <p>The 13 members of the cartel meet in Vienna next week and Iran and Venezuela have made their position clear. \"Oil supply must be well proportioned with demand, and control over Opec's excess oil supply is an issue that must be discussed,\" said Gholam Hossein Nozari, Iran's oil minister, this week. Translation: he doesn't want to see the price fall below $100.</p> <p>To many in the west, the stance will seem outrageous. Gordon Brown was furious with Opec in May, when the price was $135 a barrel. \"It is, as people will recognise, a scandal that 40% of the oil is controlled by Opec, that their decisions can restrict the supply of oil to the rest of the world, and that at a time when oil is desperately needed and supply needs to expand that Opec can withhold supply from the market,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown sounded like a buttoned-up version of the property tycoon Donald Trump, whose regular rants against Opec have entertained viewers of US financial television channels in the past year. </p> <p>\"It is an illegal monopoly,\" he told CNBC a few months ago. \"If businesses ever formed Opec, everybody would be put in jail. Every time a country hits oil, they are invited into the cartel. It's a disgrace.\"</p> <p>A decade ago, the west's view of Opec was different. The organisation, having enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s, was regarded as a spent force. Its summits in hotels in Vienna and Geneva were dismissed as squabbles over who had been cheating on quotas by over-producing - usually Venezuela or Nigeria. After 25 years of trying to control the oil market, Opec seemed doomed - damned by internal indiscipline and the success of the west in finding alternative supplies of oil.</p> <p>Its nadir was 1998, when Opec was persuaded to increase production quotas. The timing was awful. The Asian currency crisis slowed the region's Tiger economies and the price of oil fell to close to $10 a barrel. The following year, the Economist magazine famously predicted the price could be heading to $5. The world was \"drowning in oil\". Opec seemed irrelevant and powerless.</p> <p><strong>Boomtime</strong></p> <p>Then the boom started. The 1990s were revealed as a decade of under-investment, not only by Opec but by non-Opec producers, including the big oil companies. New fields hadn't been discovered. Refining capacity hadn't been built. Shell had over-stated its reserves. Existing oil fields were depleting faster than expected, especially in Mexico and the North Sea. China and India began to industrialise and to subsidise oil for their own citizens. Demand was accelerating and supply was struggling to keep up.</p> <p>The ability of the US to bully Saudi Arabia, Opec's most important member, into increasing production quickly came under question. The Saudis guard closely their data on the oil reserves and production capability. Why? \"Peak oil\" theorists argue it's because the big reserves aren't as big as advertised. </p> <p>Even President George Bush seemed to endorse the thought in January this year. \"If they don't have a lot of additional oil to put on the market, it is hard to ask somebody to do something they may not be able to do,\" he said.</p> <p>In the autumn of 2006, with the price having fallen from $75 to $60 a barrel, Opec demonstrated it was willing to use its newly restored influence over prices. It briefly reduced its production quotas, a signal that it was prepared to defend a price of $60 a barrel. With barely a blip along the way, the price climbed to that record of $147 this July.</p> <p>Was that Opec alone? Was it the combination of growth in China and India and the western oil companies' inability to increase production? Was it the weakness of the dollar, creating an incentive for producers to leave their appreciating asset in the ground rather than turn it into a depreciating currency? Was it a classic investment bubble, fuelled by the growth of financial speculation in the futures market? Probably some or all of the above. Either way, the approach of $100 is a critical test of Opec's current mood and power.</p> <p>In the old days, the Saudis were the voice of restraint. After the oil shock of the 1970s, the Saudi oil minister Ahmed Yamani urged fellow members to be cautious, arguing that high prices would lead to a reduction in demand and cause the west to become more fuel-efficient. Yet the Saudi ruling families have a huge social welfare programme to fund - as a rough guess, say some analysts, a price of $70, if sustained for a long period, would now create political tension. </p> <p>Add $20 or so for the economies of Iran and Venezuela, also built on the single commodity of oil.</p> <p>\"Could the price go below $100, to $90 or even $80?,\" asks Mike Wagstaff, chief executive of Venture Production, a North Sea oil and gas producer. \"Well, yes, it could but I can't see it going much lower than that. Opec has shown itself to be a much more disciplined organisation over the past seven or eight years.\"</p> <p>He also argues that \"the reality is that the west can't afford the price to go much below $100 because people need to fund investment.\" His point is that the industry's costs have risen as oil has become harder to find and to produce. A deep-water rig used for drilling in the deep waters off Brazil or west Africa costs $600,000 to $700,000 a day to hire; three or four years ago, the price was $200,000 to $350,000. Analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs calculate that the marginal cost of production, a critical figure for all commodities, now lies between $80 and $90 a barrel.</p> <p>Hugo Navarro of Capital Economics expects to see a classic fudge from Opec next week. He thinks official quotas will be left unchanged but actual production will be quietly cut in the coming months.</p> <p>He argues that Saudi Arabia is sensitive to western public opinion and doesn't want to be seen to be putting pressure on prices at a time when global growth is slowing. \"Even at current price levels, the cartel will still reap massive profit, given that Opec members have amongst the lowest production costs in the world,\" says Navarro.</p> <p>At the same, he says, the cartel has good reason to try to reduce output: \"The last time Opec significantly increased production to stave off a global economic slowdown in the late 1990s, the results were a disaster for the cartel.\" Even so, he thinks, attempts to support a price floor of $100 will be unsuccessful - Capital Economics sees prices fall to $90 in a year.</p> <p><strong>Bullish</strong></p> <p>Most other forecasters are more bullish, but even Goldman Sachs, which coined the phrase \"super spike\" more than three years ago, said yesterday oil was \"nearing a critical inflection point\". It still expects $130 a barrel for the fourth quarter of this year, and $140 in 2009, but attaches a big qualification: \"In the event that a global recession and hard landing in China does materialise, spot crude oil prices would likely fall well below $100 per barrel.\"</p> <p>For consumers in the west, it's hard to find a reason to be cheerful in that forecast - expect either high energy prices or global recession.

  "<p>Swaths of Britain were on flood alert last night as the first of the autumn storms lashed the country, causing road and rail chaos and leaving scores of householders mopping up yet again.</p> <p>The worst of the weather was in the south-west, where two people were killed in a car crash in driving rain, and in Wales, where rivers rose to hazardous levels after 50mm of rain fell in 24 hours on ground that was already saturated.</p> <p>Last night a 17-year-old girl died after the four-by-four she was in overturned and plunged into a swollen river in Mid Wales, Dyfed-Powys Police said.</p> <p>RAF helicopters airlifted three of the vehicle's occupants to hospital in Aberystwyth. Two of them were suffering from hypothermia, but the girl, who has not been named, died on arrival.</p> <p>There were two severe flood warnings, meaning \"extreme danger\" to lives and property, on the rivers Taff and Rhymney in south Wales and a further 25 flood warnings and 62 flood watches across Britain.</p> <p>Environment Agency and Met Office experts warned that the bad weather was likely to continue into next week, which could lead to more serious flooding.</p> <p>Areas that have so far escaped relatively unscathed, such as parts of northern England, Northern Ireland and southern Scotland, can expect to start getting their share of heavy rain today.</p> <p>In Lydney, Gloucestershire, residents were mopping up homes for the third time in 14 months. Homes were devastated by floods last year and were back under water in January. Carol Pritchard, 65, watched helplessly as once more water rushed into her house. She said: \"This is horrendous, far worse than last time - the water came through the house like a river. It has taken seven months to get everything sorted after last time. Now everything has been ruined and we've got to start all over again. I don't want to live here any more, but we have nowhere else to go.\"</p> <p>James Bevan, a local councillor, claimed the government was diverting money needed to shore up Lydney's flood defences to places such as Tewkesbury, cut off during last summer's floods.</p> <p>Last night many roads in Worcestershire and Herefordshire were swamped. Motorists in Wales were forced to seek refuge on their car roofs .</p> <p>John Mosedale, from the Environment Agency Wales, said the country faced the worst risk of flooding for 30 years. South Wales fire and rescue service had dealt with 410 flood-related calls by early evening.</p> <p>Barry Rowe, 29, and Rebecca Hoynes, 30, were killed when their car struck a tree in Plymouth in driving rain. At Bere Alston, Devon, a man was rescued by firefighters after a tree branch trapped him in his van and left him with a neck injury.</p> <p>The weather ruined end-of-summer events across the country. In Bristol plans to create a four-tonne ice replica of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton suspension bridge were scrapped due to the driving rain.

  "<h2>PICK OF THE WEEK <br>Bon Iver, For Emma </h2> <p>(4AD)<br>Much has been made of Justin \"Bon Iver\" Vernon's decision to record his album in a log cabin. Apparently, this stamps his music with a badge of alt-folk authenticity. It takes more than that, or any twerp with a guitar could traipse down to their garden shed and make one of the albums of 2008, as Bon Iver has done. Its title track, with its maudlin Mexican horns, falsetto vocals and funereal acoustic melody, is a break-up song played out how they should be: morose with a hint of dark humour. \"My knees are cold!\" Vernon intones, apropos of nothing, as the melancholy drips down like creosote. When you have nothing left to say, you say anything. </p> <h2>The Feeling, Join With Us</h2> <p>(Universal) <br>Some tawdry revisionists have questioned the belief that the Feeling are an insidious, 10-legged banality who are capturing minds like nuclear-grade Nazi Crank. Stop there! The Feeling are the Michael Schumacher of rock, grinding out another efficient win. They're the middle-class football fan, jabbing the building society-sponsored sponge hand skywards as Chelsea make it 4-0. Two minutes in and you'd swear this Sgt Pepper-ish bobbins was aimed solely at TV ad execs. Three minutes in and - \"Ring ring, ring ring, yeah!\" - you realise it's been helping sell Toyotas for yonks.</p> <h2>The Coral, Being Somebody Else</h2> <p>(Columbia) <br>If you were the Coral - and unless you are a member of Merseyside's premier exponents of rueful acousto-pop you're not - you'd viddy the Feeling's annexing of daytime radio playlists and summon up a pool ball-sized portion of bile. With Being Somebody Else, der Coral's label have plonked a tidy sum on getting Indian Summer in the roulette game that is predicting Blighty's weather. If its languid orchestral score and La's-like strumming doesn't work, then we're damned to a new Ice Age.</p> <h2>The Japanese Popstars, Rise Of Ulysses</h2> <p>(Gung-Ho! Recordings)<br>Irish they may be, but the Japanese Popstars haven't made a record about a renewed interest in the works of James Joyce. They are also not Japanese. Or pop stars. Yet. Still, this Derry trio have been tipped in dance music circles - admittedly not quite as impressive a circle nowadays - as the spiritual heirs to Underworld and Leftfield. It certainly has the energy, if not quite their subtlety, as Rise Of Ulysses sounds like an explosion at a fireworks factory. Bang, bang, woosh, screech! Wooh! Look at the pretty colours!</p> <h2>Black Kids, Look At Me (When I Rock Wichoo)</h2> <p>(Almost Gold) <br>Right clever clogs, that's the Black Kids. For all their sublime reference points - the Cure, Talking Heads, Blondie - there's something Stepfordian about them. Are they really real? If they lived 20 years ago, they'd probably base their entire month's purchases on the barometer in The Face. That said, Look At Me has a charming urgency, with shades of the Isley Brothers infusing its 1990s pop casserole. While we're here, no one's answered the big one: Are Black Kids brother and sister Ali and Reggie Youngblood any relation to Sydney? Anyone know?</p>",
  "<p>The dawn of the cold war was literally freezing. The winter of 1947 was the worst ever recorded in Europe. From January to late March, it opened a front across Russia, Germany, Italy, France and Britain, and advanced with complete lack of mercy. Snow fell in St Tropez, gale-force winds building up impenetrable drifts; ice floes drifted to the mouth of the Thames; barges bringing coal into Paris became icebound. There, the philosopher Isaiah Berlin found himself \"terrified\" by the city's coldness, \"empty and hollow and dead, like an exquisite corpse\". A slight thaw was followed by a further freeze-up, locking canals and roads under a thick layer of ice. In Berlin, Willy Brandt described how the icy cold \"attacked people like a savage beast\". Ghostly figures roamed parks looking for benches to cut up into firewood. The Tiergarten was hacked down to stumps, its statues left standing in a wilderness of frozen mud; the woods in the famous Gr\u00fcnewald were completely razed.</p> <p>Just as American journalist Walter Lippmann coined the phrase \"cold war\", the weather cruelly drove home its physical reality, carving its way into the new, post-Yalta topography of Europe, its national territories and populations mutilated, its ideologies braced in antagonistic poses. The Soviets were swift to move in behind the cold front, grasping the potential of the widespread instability of postwar Europe. With an energy and resourcefulness which showed that Stalin's regime could avail itself of an imaginative vigour unmatched by western governments, the Soviet Union deployed a battery of unconventional weapons to nudge itself into the European consciousness and soften up opinion in its favour.</p> <p>Experts in the use of culture as a tool of political persuasion, the Soviets did much in the early years of the cold war to establish its central paradigm as a cultural one. Lacking the economic power of the United States and, above all, still without a nuclear capability, they concentrated on winning \"the battle for men's minds\". America, despite a massive marshalling of the arts in the New Deal period, was a virgin in the practice of international Kulturkampf. But such innocence was soon to be forfeited in what high-level US strategists were already calling \"the greatest polarisation of power on earth\" (space, for a few years yet, was off-limits) since Rome and Carthage. \"We have to show the outside world that we have a cultural life and that we care something about it,\" the diplomat George Kennan told an audience at New York's Museum of Modern Art. \"I for one would willingly trade the entire remaining inventory of political propaganda for the results that could be achieved by this.\"</p> <p>And so it was that, against the backdrop of Europe's bombed-out cities, with all basic infrastructures in a state of collapse, a weirdly elaborate cultural life was constructed by the two superpowers as they vied with each other to score propaganda points. As early as 1945, when the stench of human bodies still hung about the ruins of Berlin, the Russians were staging brilliant performances at the State Opera, pomaded generals listening smugly to Gluck's Orpheus, punctuating the music with the tinkle of their medals. The Americans returned fire, opening the Amerika-H\u00e4user, comfortably furnished (and heated) institutes offering film showings, concerts, talks and art shows, all with \"overwhelming emphasis on America\". Within a few years, the arsenal of unconventional weapons with which each side conducted its offensive and defensive operations had swollen to include highbrow literary magazines, paintings, sculptures, comic books, motorcycles, fashion, chess, sports, architecture, design. Everything, in truth (and this is what both sides claimed to have the monopoly on), including the kitchen sink.</p> <p>The kitchen as a site of ideological conflict was pointedly iterated by the \"Kitchen Debate\" between then US vice-president Nixon and Soviet premier Khrushchev at the American National Exhibition, staged in Moscow in 1959. The encounter - over a lemon yellow kitchen designed by General Electric - still registers as one of the iconic moments of the cold war. \"Would it not be better to compete in the relative merits of washing machines than in the strength of rockets? Is this the kind of competition you want?\" Nixon challenged Khrushchev. \"We too have such things,\" Khrushchev bragged, though he failed to mention that the \"we\" was far from all-inclusive. Of the estimated 2.7 million visitors to the Moscow exhibition, only a fraction would have the opportunity to possess the kind of commodities on display. </p> <p>\"Refrigerator socialism\", harnessed as it was to a command economy, was never as widely available - or quite as attractive - as capitalism's glossy counterpart. But this was not the point: as Nixon and Khrushchev's sharp exchange shows, the question was whether items in the kitchen were mere domestic appliances, or rather the cultural equivalents of ballistic missiles, offensive weapons in the war of ideas. As the American National Exhibition explicitly stressed, a kitchen was no longer just a kitchen, but an enclave where \"liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" - the prizes of the Enlightenment, no less - could be attained through panel-controlled washing machines and electric waste grinders.</p> <p>The Kitchen Debate has been endlessly recycled as a story of basic antinomies to evoke the black-and-white, them-and-us chequerboard of cold war politics. Cold War Modern, edited by David Crowley and Jane Pavitt, and accompanying the V&amp;A exhibition they have curated, introduces a more sophisticated narrative that explores the interstices of this all-too-familiar grid. American officials in charge of the American National Exhibition reported breathlessly on its \"overwhelming success\". But the visitors' comment books, according to design historian Susan Reid, reveal an ambivalent response: \"And this is one of the greatest nations?? I feel sorry for the Americans ... Does your life really consist of only kitchens?\" This is one among many critical entries. A small charge, but enough to detonate the official victor's history that the \"freedoms\" and innovations offered by the American National Exhibition were such to make all Soviet citizens salivate and long for more of the same. </p> <p>Was the American assembly line better than the Communist party line? Was the organisation of society around individual rather than collective desires or needs intrinsically superior? The designer Raymond Loewy, in a 1950 speech to Harvard Business School, was in no doubt: \"The citizens of Lower Slobovia may not give a hoot for freedom of speech, but how they fall for a gleaming Frigidaire, a stream-lined bus or a coffee percolator.\" Possibly, but within a few years his fictional Lower Slobovians could drool over a P70 coup\u00e9 with a Duroplast body (the prototype of the Trabant), or a Messerschmitt Kabinenroller KR200, or Hedwig Bollhagen's beautiful, Bauhaus-inspired black ceramic coffee set - all cold war classics produced behind the iron curtain. Or maybe people on both sides of the ideological divide actually preferred something altogether different - mock-Tudor, or German Gothic, or whatever was knocking about in the cutlery drawer. These vernaculars may not satisfy the narrative arc of \"Cold War Modern\", and the \"questions of existence\" - Existenzfragen - it posed, but they all coexisted and competed with it.</p> <p>Loewy, who worked as an industrial design consultant for Nasa in the 1970s, aligned himself as working not just in, but for the cold war, and hence saw things in rather simplistic binaries. But by the time of the Kitchen Debate, these binaries had lost their edge. Khrushchev had long since denounced Stalin, in the least secret \"secret\" speech ever made, and commenced the thaw that introduced a less restrictive, if still state-controlled, cultural agenda. Socialist realism, \"the mask of Stalinism\", was, if not a thing of the past, no longer the sole official art. Indeed, it makes only a brief appearance in the V&amp;A exhibition (principally, the huge tapestry depicting the reconstruction of Warsaw, woven by students at the State High School of Fine Art in Lodz). In parallel, and somewhat counterintuitively, this was the moment when abstract expressionism, deployed as \"free enterprise\" painting by the cultural cartel of MoMA and the CIA, became fixed as the art officiel of the west, leading one American critic to complain that realists had to \"live in basements and pass still lifes around like samizdat\". We can savour the delicious irony now, but at the time, and with so much at stake, the cultural cold war was a terribly po-faced affair.</p> <p>Khrushchev's intervention in architecture also powerfully debunked the Stalin-era aesthetic, whose \"American\" skyscraper projects were one of the more bizarre inversions of the cold war. There were to be no more cathedrals in the cult of personality, with their classical cornices, lintels and ornamented porticoes (the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw is the example par excellence of these encrusted towers). Where Stalin's vicious cultural tsar Andrei Zhdanov had denounced modernist architecture as \"shapeless boxes\" expressing the \"hunger of monopoly capitalism\", obliterating all national character and destroying valuable historical complexes, Khrushchev now sanctioned the return of this style. Less, he said, was more, and he ordered architects to replace cornices with conscience, to deliver affordable, functional living environments worthy of the citizen of the Soviet utopia. What was delivered, on a massive scale, was more and more of less and less: endless avenues of prefab, multi-storeyed blocks, of weeping concrete and mildewed panel walls. Cold War Modern, as applied to mass housing, really meant \"more modernism\" - and it was a miserable legacy.</p> <p>In another context, however, Cold War Modern produced some architectural miracles. The Ostankino television tower in Moscow (1967-69), a scale model of which has been commissioned for the V&amp;A show, projects a dizzying, optimistic vision, a technotopia. Such telecommunication towers, which sprung up in both east and west, combined technical wizardry with gravity-defying engineering. Important gauges in cold war competition, they served twin functions as high-tech instruments and visual symbols of power. Designed to attract the public, they typically included viewing decks, restaurants and hotels, features of the leisure economy. Like the Eiffel tower, they cast an irrational spell, becoming the focus of dreams and bodily pleasures - in the reach for mythical status, both the Ostankino tower and the East Berlin Fernsehturm were staffed by air hostesses dressed in synthetic uniforms. Because of its unique position in a partitioned city that had physically internalised the divisive logic of the cold war, the Fernsehturm acquired another set of meanings: for the communists, it was a crow's nest in a sea occupied by enemy powers; for the citizens of East Germany, denied the right to leave their own country, it provided a tantalising view across the wall into the lost domain of freedom.</p> <p>As the cold war progressed, much of its basic premise - of antithesis and constructed antagonism - was paradoxically both accelerated and undermined by such technological advances. Sputnik, which beeped its message of Soviet ascendancy in the space race across the world in 1957, also announced the beginning of what Marshall McLuhan famously dubbed \"the global village\", of a world connected by the \"cosmic web\" of communication technology. While much of this technology emanated from the highly competitive field of military research, it produced a kind of invisible membrane that covered both sides of the cold war divide. Earth, and now the space that surrounded it, was connected by technologies developed to enforce the ideology of separateness. This paradox encouraged optimism and despair in equal measure. As the philosopher Hannah Arendt observed in 1958, Sputnik signalled a modern desire to use human artifice to escape our earthbound condition. While some viewed this as the shape of the future, for Arendt this escape into artifice represented the path to worldly alienation. </p> <p>Escape - from ideology and its deadening diktats, from the threat of nuclear irradiation, from the industrial overload of the ecosystem - is inscribed in the genetic code of Cold War Modern. It's in Jackson Pollock's splurgy, tangled lines that reach across and over the edges of his canvases; it's in Eero Saarinen's Womb Chair (1948), a cocoon in which the body can hide; it's in the crypts, caves and bunkers drawn up by architects as they searched underground, beneath the sea, in space, for other habitats. Or in architect-designer Buckminster Fuller's defensive geodesic domes, and the bubble he drew covering part of Manhattan (1962); or in Oasis 7, a giant inflatable environment suspended in mid-air, complete with small beach and palm tree (by Viennese architects Haus-Rucker-Co, 1972). Powerful commentaries, all, on the fear of Doomsday and the attempts to survive or even domesticate it. </p> <p>If fallout was about anxiety, dropout was a kind of defiant rebuttal. Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes reappeared as hippy homes in Colorado's Drop City (1965-73), no longer futuristic membranes but present-day dwellings assembled, like colourful globular shanties, from discarded car parts and other junk. A retreat from consumerism and assembly lines that, playfully, ironically, reassembled the bits and recycled them out of their own obsolescence into a new living environment. If the bomb had fallen on Drop City, then the end of the world would have been a mesmerising, kaleidoscopic happening.</p>",
  "<p>In the combination of New Orleans and hurricanes, we have the most powerful argument possible for the necessity of \"change\". It's all there: gaping inequality, deep racism, crumbling public infrastructure, global warming, rampant corruption, the Blackwater-isation of the public sector. And none of it is in the past tense. In New Orleans whole neighbourhoods have gone to seed, Charity hospital remains shuttered, public housing has been deliberately destroyed - and the levee system is still far from repaired.</p> <p>Gustav should have been political rat poison for the Republicans, no matter how well it was managed. Yet, as Peter Baker noted in the New York Times, \"rather than run away from the hurricane and its political risks, Mr McCain ran toward it\". If this strategy worked, it was at least partly because Barack Obama has been running away from New Orleans for his entire campaign.</p> <p>Unlike John Edwards, who started and ended his nomination bid surrounded by the decay of New Orleans's Ninth Ward, Obama has shied away from the powerful symbolism the city offers. He waited almost a year after Hurricane Katrina to visit New Orleans and spent just half a day there ahead of the Louisiana primary. During the Democratic convention, Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden made no mention of New Orleans in their keynotes. Bill Clinton spared just a few words: \"Katrina and cronyism.\"</p> <p>In his Denver speech, Obama did invoke a government \"that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes\". But that only scratches the surface of what happened to New Orleans's poorest residents, who were first forcibly relocated and then forced to watch from afar as their homes, schools and hospitals were stolen. As Obama spoke in Denver, families in New Orleans were already packing their bags in anticipation of Gustav, steeling themselves for yet another evacuation. They heard not even a perfunctory \"our thoughts and prayers are with you\" from the Democratic candidate for president.</p> <p>There are plenty of political reasons for this, of course. Obama's campaign is pitching itself to the middle class, not the class of discarded people New Orleans represents. The problem is that by remaining virtually silent about the most dramatic domestic outrage in modern US history, Obama created a political vacuum. When Gustav hit, all McCain needed to do to fill it was show up. Sure, it was cynical for McCain to claim the hurricane zone as a campaign backdrop; but it was Obama who left that potent terrain vacant.</p> <p>Until now, Obama's supporters have largely accepted the campaign's assessment of the compromises necessary to win, offering only gentle prodding. The fact that the Republicans have turned New Orleans to their advantage should put an end to this blind obedience. </p> <p>Republicans have a better attitude towards their candidate. When they don't like McCain's positions, they change them. Take the hottest-button issue of the campaign: offshore oil drilling. Just four months ago, it was not even on the radar. During the Republican primary, the issue barely came up, and when it did, McCain did not support it. None of this bothered former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his newly minted American Solutions for Winning the Future. Gingrich waited patiently for what his party loves most: a crisis. It arrived in May, when oil approached $130 a barrel. First came a petition to lower petrol prices by opening up domestic drilling (nonsense). Next was a poll, packed with laughably leading questions: \"Some people have suggested that, to combat the rising cost of energy and reduce dependence on foreign energy sources, the United States should use more of its own domestic energy reserves, including the oil and coal it already has here in the US. Do you support or oppose this idea?\" You can guess what people said. Two weeks later, McCain flipped on offshore oil drilling.</p> <p>There was always a risk attached to making offshore drilling the centrepiece of the McCain campaign, since it is not nearly as safe as its advocates claim. Environmentalists have been trying to point this out, but nothing makes the case quite as forcefully as a category five hurricane rocking oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, forcing evacuations and raising the spectre of a serious spill.</p> <p>Gustav was one of those rare moments when political arguments are made by reality, not rhetoric. It was the time to simply point and say: \"This is why we oppose more drilling.\" It was also the time to recall that during hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the official Minerals Management Service report found more than 100 accidents leading to a total of 743,400 gallons of oil spilled throughout the region. To put that in perspective, 100,000 gallons is classified as a \"major spill\". If one is feeling particularly bold, a category five hurricane is also an opportune time to mention that scientists see a link between heavier storms and warming ocean temperatures - warmed in part by the fossil fuels being extracted from those fallible platforms.</p> <p>Obama was not able to make these kinds of arguments when Gustav hit. That's because his campaign had made another \"strategic\" decision: to compromise on offshore oil drilling. Again a vacuum that had been opened up was rapidly filled by the Republicans, who instantly (and absurdly) linked the hurricane to the need for \"energy security\". The morning after Gustav made landfall, Bush called for more drilling. Earlier, McCain had visited the hurricane zone with his new running mate, Sarah Palin, whose sole prior claim to national fame was telling cable shows that \"we need to drill, drill, drill\".</p> <p>In moments of crisis, it is possible to speak hard truths with great force and clarity. But when the truth has gone silent, lies, boldly told, will work almost as well.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This column was first published in <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com\">The Nation</a> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"http://www.naomiklein.org\">naomiklein.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Abu Dhabi's royal family paid a lot of money for Manchester City but it expects to get a lot back in return, mostly in ways that cannot be measured in mere cash.</p> <p>The \u00a3210m investment is supposed to buy a top finish in the Premiership and then the Champions League, where the real money is made.

Nothing could be more conducive to clinching trade and investment deals.</p> <p>Ten times more people watch Premier League football on television in China than in Britain, and in the remotest villages where the locals speak hardly a word of English, they usually know how to say Manchester United. The emirs of Abu Dhabi hope they will be able to manage the word City.</p> <p>On planet football the US is no more than a developing country. England is the true superpower. The Premier League is the richest and best loved of all the world's football leagues, a global super-brand. The big money and the best players may be foreign, but they play on English soil in front of mostly English crowds. Gordon Brown has tried to press this advantage. He calls it \"England's secret diplomatic weapon\" and his forays abroad have often been wrapped in football paraphernalia. When he visited Shanghai as chancellor three years ago he latched on to the fact that the city was twinned with Liverpool and took with him Liverpool and Everton kits.</p> <p>Britain is not alone in using football as diplomatic currency. Armenia's president, Serge Sarkisian, has invited his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah Gul, to a 2010 World Cup qualifier today to break the ice between the two countries.</p> <p>Australia's decision to switch from the Oceania World Cup qualifying group to the Asian Football Confederation was taken largely to raise the country's image in the emerging economies of the east.</p> <p>Individuals can play the game as well.

The purchase also stitched him into the fabric of British (and global) sporting life to the extent that it could make him untouchable if the tides turn against him in Moscow.</p> <p>For the princes of Abu Dhabi, the advantages are both personal and diplomatic. According to Mamoun Fandy, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, it is about keeping up with Dubai, Abu Dhabi's greatest rival among the seven statelets of the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>\"There is a general feeling in the Emirates that Dubai has become the brand name for the country, while Abu Dhabi - though the capital and largest emirate - is receding in the background. The whole plan is putting Abu Dhabi back on the map,\" Fandy said.</p>",
  "<p>British Energy last night appeared close to agreeing a \u00a312bn takeover by EDF after the French firm agreed to sweeten its bid.</p> <p>An offer to share a larger slice of future earnings with investors was expected to clinch the takeover plan with the backing of ministers, said sources close to the deal. The government owns 36% of British Energy and is understood to be near to signing a deal after Invesco, the fund management group with a 15% holding, withdrew its threat to block the plan.</p> <p>Invesco refused to comment on the situation, but sources said that though the parties had yet to agree the details of the takeover, little stood in the way of EDF, British Energy and the government finalising terms within a matter of weeks.</p> <p>Only last month Invesco favoured a rival plan for a merger with Centrica, the owner of British Gas, with Invesco having voiced concern that the French utility's bid failed to value the UK nuclear operator properly.</p> <p>EDF agreed a 765p-a-share cash offer for British Energy in July, but the bid was rejected at the last minute by its two largest private-sector shareholders: by Invesco and also by M&amp;G, which owns 7% of the company. Discussions in recent weeks have focused on a rival plan to merge British Energy with Centrica. Invesco, which also owns 5% of Centrica, believed Centrica placed a higher value on the shares.</p> <p>At the time Neil Woodford, head of investments at Invesco, said: \"A combination of British Energy and Centrica solves the problems facing both companies today. Together they can work out a joint venture with EDF to build nuclear sites.\"</p> <p>However, industry sources said Woodford had in recent days switched sides to back the EDF deal. A revision by EDF of the proportion of earnings paid to investors in the future is understood to have a played a key role. A 25% fall in the oil price, which makes EDF's cash offer look more generous, was another factor.</p> <p>EDF has said it remains committed to building nuclear generators in Britain but it remains unclear whether the UK government has the appetite to confront the anti-nuclear lobby and back plans for more power stations. Ministers, including prime minister Gordon Brown, have signalled their intention to include nuclear in their energy plans, but without making any concrete commitments</p> <p>Centrica has been prevented from having direct talks with EDF, but is expected to accept an offer for a 25% share in the merged company should EDF clinch the takeover.</p> <p>The British firm is keen to become involved in nuclear power and had looked at the prospect of an all-share offer for British Energy, but the proposals were put on ice when the EDF bid emerged. The government preferred the EDF bid because it wanted cash rather than shares. </p> <p>Last month, British Energy blamed lower output and the higher cost of remedial work at two nuclear stations for a fall in profits from \u00a3253m to \u00a3129m in the three months to the end of June, the first quarter of its financial year. But the company said it was encouraged that the role for nuclear new-build within Britain's energy policy was now firmly established.</p> <p>British Energy owns eight nuclear power stations and one coal-fired plant.

  "<h2>1969 Frank Kermode</h2> <p>The first judges were Rebecca West, Stephen Spender, David Farrer and WL Webb, at that time literary editor of the Guardian. We were handsomely treated: in London we haunted Bertorelli\u2019s, but we spent more than one weekend at Michael Astor\u2019s beautiful Cotswold house, where Dame Rebecca strode the grounds authoritatively between bouts of laying down the law. There were perhaps 60 books, which seemed a lot, though modern judges are said to read twice as many. Getting through the 60 was made easier by our not daring to take on Dame Rebecca. \u201cMiss Murdoch writes good and bad novels in alternate years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a bad year.\u201d Muriel Spark: \u201cclever but too playful.\u201d And out they went. </p> <p>Two of us favoured Nicholas Mosley\u2019s Impossible Object, but were soon silenced. The choice of PH Newby\u2019s Something to Answer For was the result of a compromise. Dame Rebecca didn\u2019t dislike it as much as nearly all the others. Surveyors of the prize\u2019s history have spoken ill of this good book, perhaps without reading it, or by being too ready to suppose that this industrious writer could manage a novel a year as well as running the Third Programme. Anyway, I remember this, my one experience of judging, with much pleasure and amusement.</p> <h2>1970 Antonia Fraser</h2> <p>The judging of the 1970 prize was a low-key affair except for the feisty behaviour of Dame Rebecca West, a judge for the second year running. At one point she denounced Margaret Drabble for her novels of domestic life on the grounds that \u201cAnyone can do the washing-up; just get a big bowl and some liquid; so why complain about it?\u201d The novel in question was The Waterfall, which both Richard Hoggart and I admired greatly (and didn\u2019t think was about washing-up). I knew Rebecca West, since she was a friend and neighbour of my parents in Sussex, and was very fond of her; all the same, it occurred to me that she was possibly one of the brilliant old ladies who felt threatened by a brilliant young one in the shape of Maggie Drabble. In the end we were split between William Trevor\u2019s Mrs Eckdorf in O\u2019Neill\u2019s Hotel and Bernice Rubens\u2019s The Elected Member. I voted for Rubens but today would vote for Trevor. </p> <p>1971 was much more exacting. The most exciting thing that happened to me as a Booker Judge for the second time was not controversial. I shared a taxi back with fellow judge Saul Bellow on a long, long ride from somewhere in the City: he was nattily dressed in a pale green shantung suit, blue shirt, green tie with large blue dots on it; his silver hair and slanting, large dark eyes made him look like a 30s film star playing a refined gangster. Suddenly he leaned forward and asked: \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019re a very handsome woman?\u201d I pondered on a suitable reply, modest yet encouraging. But having spoken, the Great Man closed his eyes and remained apparently asleep for the rest of the journey.</p> <h2>1971 John Gross</h2> <p>A faint aroma of the Nobel prize - or of Nobel prizes yet to come - hangs over the 1971 Booker. First, the award went to VS Naipaul (who was to be Nobel laureate in 2001) for In a Free State. It was a result with which I agreed. Second, the organisers had succeeded in persuading a distinguished writer from abroad to be one of the judges: Saul Bellow (who was to be Nobel laureate in 1976). It seemed a thrilling prospect.</p> <p>In the event, one of the things I remember most clearly about Bellow is that he insisted on being put up at the Ritz (which must have burned a big hole in the budget), and then complained because he hadn\u2019t been given a room overlooking Green Park.</p> <p>Another recollection is his response when I advanced the claims of Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which apart from the Naipaul was the book on the shortlist I most favoured. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s one of those little tinkling teacup things that the British always do well.\u201d He was quite wrong - Mrs Palfrey is a work of deep feeling - but his dismissiveness effectively put paid to its chances.</p> <h2>1972 George Steiner</h2> <p>It was the most illustrious panel in the Booker\u2019s history. Both the other judges, Cyril Connolly and Elizabeth Bowen, were too ill to attend the ceremony. I fought very hard for John Berger to win for G, and then he threw it in my face by giving half the prize money to the Black Panthers. It was a very grim experience. I was in a very precarious position at the time and I literally thought it was the end for me in this country. I thought I would have to pack my bags and go. </p> <h2>1973 Edna O\u2019Brien</h2> <p>Mary McCarthy and I were the judges, with Karl Miller presiding as chairman. Disputes were negligible. From a batch of about 20, it was whittled down to two contenders - The Siege of Krishnapur by JG Farrell and The Black Prince by Iris Murdoch, with Farrell winning by a whisker. Next day, Mary changed her mind and it was left to Miller to cast the deciding vote, which he did with alacrity and no rancour. The prize has changed as the literary/publishing world has undergone a radical and not always edifying sea change: the celebrity virus now infects authors and judges alike.</p> <h2>1974 Ion Trewin</h2> <p>We were three judges - AS Byatt, Elizabeth Jane Howard and me. At the shortlist meeting, Jane remarked that she thought Ending Up by Kingsley Amis (then her husband) was his best book and should go on the shortlist. I looked first at Antonia, and then at Martyn Goff, the prize\u2019s administrator - both remained impassive. We broke for a breather. Martyn said that as chairman it was up to me. Antonia liked the novel (as did I). On literary grounds neither of us had problems about shortlisting it, but what would the press say? </p> <p>The Booker was already familiar with controversies. Martyn, I know, was not averse to the publicity that our decision would inevitably bring. (This was to centre around a vituperative correspondence in the Times.) But would the burgeoning reputation of the prize be damaged? He thought not. More important was our choice of winner. Antonia and I spoke up for Nadine Gordimer\u2019s The Conservationist, but Jane was less impressed. She remained keen on Ending Up, but realising that neither Antonia nor I would countenance it winning, she concentrated on Stanley Middleton\u2019s Holiday, a study of middle England that she saw as a \u201cperfect miniature\u201d.</p> <p>With only three judges, it seemed important to me that we did not compromise or produce a two-one verdict. Might we split the prize between Middleton and Gordimer? Martyn said he knew of no reason why not. We were vindicated by The Conservationist being selected this year for the Best of the Booker shortlist.</p> <p>My favourite Booker winner remains Schindler\u2019s Ark (1982) by Thomas Keneally (but I must declare my interest and say that I was its editor).</p> <h2>1975 Susan Hill</h2> <p>Peter Ackroyd was the young, newly appointed literary editor of the Spectator. Roy Fuller was a distinguished older poet. Angus Wilson was in his years as founder of the creative writing course at UEA and one of the elder statesmen of the contemporary novel. It was a daunting experience to join them as a judge. I took the mountain of submitted novels on my honeymoon, and our first meeting was scheduled for the day I returned. I discovered that Angus had spent a holiday at the same Italian hotel a few weeks earlier. So we should all have been in mellow mood, and three of us were. But Roy Fuller was not the easiest man to work with. He was acerbic and disliked being contradicted, and when it came to choosing a shortlist he refused to join in, on the grounds that we had agreed on our winner, so a shortlist was superfluous. The Booker management committee was, rightly, having none of this and insisted. </p> <p>I had been shortlisted myself three years earlier, and it had given my career a huge boost. I fought hard. We all did. Fuller grudgingly agreed to allowing a shortlist of two - the winner and one runner-up. Otherwise, he was going to walk. It was tricky and it spoiled what should have been an enjoyable experience. I was very happy with our winner, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala\u2019s Heat and Dust, but I wish we had stood up to Fuller and if he had walked out, so be it. </p> <p>My personal Best of Bookers is JG Farrell\u2019s The Siege of Krishnapur. The omission of Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s masterpiece The Blue Flower even from the shortlist in 1995 I find quite inexplicable. </p> <h2>1976 Francis King</h2> <p>There is a vast difference of scale between the prize as I experienced it as a judge and how it is now. Then the prize money was far less generous, and the fee for the judging was an honorarium. There were only three judges: our chairman Walter Allen, an admirable novelist and critic, then confined to a wheelchair, so that I had to read out his presentation speech for him; Mary Wilson, the wife of the prime minister; and me. Despite his failing health, Allen was, unlike me, immensely conscientious in reading every submission from cover to cover. Mary Wilson, a lover of poetry and herself an artless but often touching poet, was at the disadvantage of having read few novels in the course of her life - so that she was clearly puzzled when I referred to one of the submissions as \u201cKafkaesque\u201d. </p> <p>My sister Elizabeth looked through the piles of books awaiting my reading, and eventually held up David Storey\u2019s Saville. With a colleague, John Guest, she had already put in a lot of robust work as one of its two editors. \u201cThis will be the winner,\u201d she announced. It was, she explained, an epic about a north country mining community and was therefore exactly what would appeal to Allen, a lifetime socialist, and to the wife of a Labour PM. She was right. I battled for Julian Rathbone\u2019s King Fisher Lives, to no avail. Mary Wilson was obdurate: \u201cI couldn\u2019t be party to giving the prize to a book about cannibalism.\u201d </p> <p>For me far and away the best Booker winner in the whole history of the Prize is JG Farrell\u2019s The Siege of Krishnapur. The best of all the novels that ought to have won the Prize but failed to do so is Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s masterpiece The Blue Flower</p> <h2>1977 Beryl Bainbridge</h2> <p>Making a choice was very difficult - because it was this great prize of the world, one had to be very careful. Since I was published by Duckworth, it was very peculiar to have a Duckworth novel - Great Granny Webster by Caroline Blackwood - included in the vote. I put my vote forward - for Blackwood - but the discussion on it lasted only about three minutes, because it was such a short book. So nobody was really interested in that. All I can remember of the final meeting is that I got terribly tired, I literally sank lower and lower under the table. Brendan Gill, who I thought was American, went towards the balcony saying he was going to throw himself off, he was so fed up. Philip Larkin was completely silent most of the time. Nobody dared say a word to him and he never said a word back. The only one who was in total control of everything was Robin Ray. He was so clever that we all went along with whatever he said, and he wanted Staying On by Paul Scott to win. Poor Scott was too ill to collect the prize.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been shortlisted for the Booker five times and never won. I\u2019m just very pleased to have been noticed.</p> <h2>1978 Derwent May</h2> <p>In 1978, all the five jury members had a different first choice, and they were all sticking to it. Suddenly someone suggested a compromise candidate that we all quite liked, but it seemed to me that we were now heading for disaster. Freddie Ayer, the chairman, had more or less pulled out, saying that the only novels he enjoyed reading were crime novels. So I went round the jury - the other three were all novelists, PH Newby, Angela Huth and Clare Boylan - and said to them in turn \u201cIs this book your first choice?\u201d All, rather sheepishly, said \u201cNo\u201d. I said, \u201cThe winner must surely be at least one person\u2019s first choice\u201d, and I saw it was the moment for me to push what I thought was unmistakably the best book, Iris Murdoch\u2019s The Sea, The Sea - which I knew was at least one juror\u2019s second choice (the other shortlisted authors were Kingsley Amis, Andr\u00e9 Brink, Penelope Fitzgerald, Jane Gardam and Bernice Rubens). I\u2019m glad to say it won. </p> <p>The best three winners have, I think, been the Murdoch, William Golding\u2019s Rites of Passage and Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Remains of the Day. The prize has always lurched too much in favour of writers with unpromising backgrounds or good liberal attitudes, but it has unfailingly provided an excellent focus on the year\u2019s new novels.</p> <h2>1979 Hilary Spurling </h2> <p>I loved my Booker summer, which boils down in my memory to long, hot, hazy days spent lying under a tree in the garden reading novels and saying to anyone who tried to interrupt: \u201cGo away, I\u2019m working.\u201d It was a strong field and the bookies\u2019 favourite was VS Naipaul\u2019s A Bend in the River. Its opponents on the panel argued that the book shouldn\u2019t strictly be classified as a novel, and in any case he\u2019d won the prize before. The Naipaul lobby (including me) snapped back that the novel was doomed if it couldn\u2019t expand to include this sort of documentary fiction, and that our job was to pick the year\u2019s best book, regardless of its author.</p> <p>The final verdict was as much of a shock to the judges as it was to everybody else. We\u2019d spent the entire afternoon at loggerheads, and in the end compromised by giving the prize to everybody\u2019s second choice, Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s small, slight, melancholy but beautifully judged and executed Offshore. Her recently published collected letters make it clear that her triumph - and the general incredulity that greeted it - caused her humiliation ever after.</p> <h2>1980 Claire Tomalin</h2> <p>I was determined that Alice Munro should be on the shortlist, and stuck my heels in to get her there. There were two real contenders for the prize, I believed, Anthony Burgess\u2019s Earthly Powers and William Golding\u2019s Rites of Passage, and the night before the final judging session I lay awake debating with myself: the Golding beautifully written and constructed, but with a slightly musty feel about it; Burgess a magnificent entertainer, overflowing with good humour, sometimes tipping into the slapdash. Both books thoroughly deserving. The next morning David Daiches, our chairman, began: \u201cWe\u2019ll go through the list in alphabetical order. I take it no one consider Burgess a possible winner?\u201d Silence from the others. I exploded into a eulogy of Burgess\u2019s energy, invention and comic gift. I saw I had convinced no one, and felt that left only Golding. And so it was. Burgess sent a message saying he would not come to the dinner unless he won. I don\u2019t blame him. I saw a tear trickle down Golding\u2019s cheek when the announcement was made. I have re-read neither book, and I have rejoiced to see Alice Munro win the recognition she deserves. </p> <h2>1981 Hermione Lee</h2> <p>Salman Rushdie has won the Booker of Bookers and the Best of all Bookers, with his lastingly dazzling, deep and splendid novel, now a classic of world literature, Midnight\u2019s Children. But over a quarter of a century ago, when I was one of the judges who gave him the prize, his book was by no means an easy winner. Not many people had heard of Rushdie, unless they\u2019d read a weird piece of science fiction called Grimus or seen the stunning extracts from the new novel in Granta. Our panel of judges (Samuel Hynes, Joan Bakewell, Brian Aldiss and me, with Malcolm Bradbury as chair) were pulling in different ways. We were reading many writers with more established reputations, and much more experience, than Rushdie - such as Muriel Spark. (To my lasting regret, we overlooked one of Nadine Gordimer\u2019s best novels, July\u2019s People.) Brian Aldiss was especially keen on Doris Lessing\u2019s \u201cspace fiction\u201d The Sirian Experiments, Malcolm on Ian McEwan\u2019s The Comfort of Strangers. </p> <p>We all jumped at the late arrival of the almost forgotten Anglo-Irish writer Molly Keane, the short-listing of whose wicked and eccentric novel Good Behaviour gained her a devoted new following. But our final discussion was painfully split between Midnight\u2019s Children and The White Hotel, DM Thomas\u2019s psychoanalytical erotic novel, centring on the massacre at Babi Yar, which made a strong impression on me at the time but now, looking back, seems to me sensationalist and exploitative. Sam Hynes, Joan Bakewell and I were firmly on the side of Rushdie; Brian Aldiss was passionately keen on Thomas, and so was Malcolm Bradbury, who tried at the very end of the discussion to argue that the chair should have a casting, and over-ruling vote. This was not allowed, Rushdie won by 3 votes to 2, and Brian Aldiss (whose intensity impressed me) left the room with tears in his eyes. When the 1981 prize was announced, a mighty career was launched. It would have taken off anyway, but it was helped by the prize. Chairing the prize 25 years on, I felt happy to be helping on Kiran Desai, a literary descendant of Rushdie\u2019s.</p> <h2>1982 Paul Bailey</h2> <p>There are many things I regret doing, and being a judge for the Booker prize is one of them. For some years after I was associated with two novels I absolutely loathed and would not have even started reading in other circumstances (on the shortlist that year were Thomas Keneally\u2019s Schindler\u2019s Ark, John Arden\u2019s Silence Among the Weapons, William Boyd\u2019s An Ice-Cream War, Lawrence Durrell\u2019s Constance or Solitary Practices, Alice Thomas Ellis\u2019s The 27th Kingdom and Timothy Mo\u2019s Sour Sweet). They are history now and are likely to remain so. My one good deed was to ensure a place on the shortlist for Sour Sweet, consequently bringing his work to a larger audience. But otherwise it was a dispiriting experience. The winner, by a single vote, was Schindler\u2019s Ark, a controversial but ultimately very popular choice.</p> <p>The prize was founded, in part, to encourage competitiveness. Which of the six novelists will make it to the finishing post? This grisly notion constitutes a perfect recipe for envy, back-biting and self-glorification. The Booker has certainly mirrored fashion - the collapse of the empire; post-modernist Victorian pastiche; New Age sentimentality. Several stinkers have been honoured, but there have been some glorious losers: Alice Munro\u2019s The Beggar Maid, John McGahern\u2019s Amongst Women and Edward St Aubyn\u2019s Mother\u2019s Milk. A wonderful book such as Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s The Blue Flower was completely ignored, and I hope the judges for 1995 are blushing now to be reminded of their grotesque oversight.</p> <h2>1983 Fay Weldon</h2> <p>A lively year, as Booker prizes go. We had a distinguished set of judges and some terrific books. The panel was finally split between a Coetzee and a Rushdie - a clash of continents. As the chairperson I had the casting vote - which is not saying \u201coh, I like that one best\u201d, but weighing up the arguments of one set of judges against the others and deciding which are the most convincing. The Coetzee (Life &amp; Times of Michael K) got it, and Rushdie was really annoyed. </p> <p>As a fervent feminist (25 years back), and taking time to make up my mind, I made a joke: \u201cI haven\u2019t got my husband here to help me decide.\u201d But one should never make jokes in the presence of the police, security or at a Booker prize judging, and word got round that I meant it. Then I had to deliver the customary chairperson\u2019s speech. After I sat down, the then president of the Publishers Association got to his feet, crossed the room and hit my agent Giles Gordon, second best thing to hitting me. I\u2019d used the speech to reproach the publishers for giving such rotten deals to writers. Since the BBC was working to rule, they cut the cameras at 10pm precisely: I was using transparent screens from which to make the speech (a Thatcher trick), and they went blank before I had time to finish with the usual pacifying bit about how you are all honourable men and none of what I say applies to you. Instead, I just had to sit down and all hell broke loose. </p> <p>I had actually shown the speech to the organisers earlier, but I suppose they hadn\u2019t bothered to read it. I hadn\u2019t thought it was all that inflammatory. Michael Caine, charismatic chairman of Bookers, came up to me years later, when I had been inadvertently invited to one of the subsequent dinners, and said: \u201cIt is not by any wish of mine you are here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all got rather dull since: the prize tends to go to well-behaved and deserving writers: no subversion allowed. No one hits anyone. </p> <h2>1984 John Fuller</h2> <p>This was the year when the hot favourite, JG Ballard (Empire of the Sun), was passed over for a relative newcomer, Anita Brookner (Hotel du Lac). Hardly a scandal, but in a strong year we had already discarded some big names (Burgess, Golding, Spark, Bainbridge, two Amises, etc) before reaching the shortlist, so that journalistic antennae were twitching, and the outcome was felt to be a further surprise. The judges got on pretty well together. We were somewhat exercised by the question of whether Julian Barnes\u2019s Flaubert\u2019s Parrot was really a novel, while in the final judging session Anthony Curtis continued to argue for David Lodge (Small World), and Ted Rowlands stuck out for the Ballard. I thought that the Brookner was, in its economy and elegance, a small triumph of moral insight worthy of the tradition of James and Forster to which it belonged. I was relieved to have support from Polly Devlin and the somewhat eccentric Richard Cobb in this, and pleased at the nudge to her career that the prize must have given. </p> <h2>1985 Marina Warner</h2> <p>Norman St John Stevas was our chair, and early on that summer he picked out a number of books which he recommended his panel to read. Among them was a surprise, a bulky novel called The Bone People by Keri Hulme. Alongside the many gleamingly designed offerings from the major publishing houses, it had the distinction of being published by a women\u2019s cooperative in New Zealand, who, when the book won the prize against very high odds, came up in full island dress to collect it, chanting a Maori praise song. </p> <p>Feelings in the final meeting - and afterwards - ran very high about this novel, but St John Stevas unexpectedly championed it throughout. Nina Bawden opposed it very strongly on the grounds of its violence (the novel tells a terrifying story of child-beatings), and wrote later publicly to distance herself from the decision. Nina found herself significantly outnumbered in her opposition, because Joanna Lumley didn\u2019t attend the final judging. She sent a message to say she was in rehearsal and that her nominated winner was Doris Lessing, for The Good Terrorist. When she heard The Bone People had won, she too dissociated herself from the judgment. JW Lambert and I supported the book. </p> <p>I think that the best argument for the whole cruel and unfair business of prizes is that they can lead readers to writers who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be read much or perhaps at all. I didn\u2019t think Lessing needed the prize (and she would agree) and certainly not for a novel that is not her best (though it\u2019s a feature of prizes that authors often win for their weakest works). </p> <h2>1986 Anthony Thwaite</h2> <p>My chairing of the 1986 judges was marred, or enlivened, by several scandals or leaks or items of gossip. I was said (wrongly) to have lectured my fellow judges on \u201chow to read a novel\u201d. I unwisely wrote to Julian Barnes to commiserate with him about his non-appearance on the shortlist: I was quoted as blaming it on \u201call those women\u201d (my four fellow judges were Edna Healey, Isabel Quigly, Gillian Reynolds and Bernice Rubens).</p> <p>It was a splendid shortlist: Kingsley Amis, Margaret Atwood, Paul Bailey, Robertson Davies, Kazuo Ishiguro, Timothy Mo. We were still going to and fro up until 10 minutes before the press announcement had to be made: two strongly for Amis, two equally strongly for Davies (What\u2019s Bred in the Bone), and a wobbler in the middle. At the last moment the wobbler came down on the side of The Old Devils, and Amis had won. A very satisfactory result, I thought.</p> <h2>1987 PD James</h2> <p>I look back on my chairmanship in 1987 as a very happy experience, particularly as I had as my colleagues four hardworking, enthusiastic and knowledgeable judges: Lady Selina Hastings, Allan Massie, Trevor McDonald and John B Thompson. I did have a fear at the time - and still do - that to ask the panel to read more than 100 novels in a comparatively short time can result in a literary surfeit which makes the final judgment more difficult. Choosing the winner was a long process, and I remember scurrying to the dinner table a little after the meal had started. At the end, however, the vote was unanimous - Penelope Lively won, for Moon Tiger - which is what I had hoped for. The Booker may at times have tended to increase the unhelpful dichotomy between popular storytelling and books which are classified as literary novels, but most of the winners have combined high literary achievement with compelling storytelling. </p> <h2>1988 Blake Morrison</h2> <p>We were a jury of writers that year: Sebastian Faulks, Rose Tremain, Philip French and, in the chair, Michael Foot, who seemed keener to talk about Byron than to reminisce about leading the Labour party. As early as our first meeting, Peter Carey\u2019s Oscar and Lucinda was the clear frontrunner. The only arguments were about which novels should be with him on the shortlist. I read the bulk of the 100 or so entries during a fortnight\u2019s holiday with two small children in Wales, rising early and retiring late. Those we finally settled on were Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses (which I read with innocent pleasure - the controversy over it didn\u2019t erupt till the following year), Bruce Chatwin\u2019s Utz (his last novel - his funeral was the day of the fatwa), David Lodge\u2019s Nice Work (one of his best), Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s The Beginning of Spring (one of her best) and Marina Warner\u2019s The Lost Father. </p> <p>My biggest regret was failing to get Doris Lessing\u2019s The Fifth Child on the shortlist - though in retrospect Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s first novel, The Swimming-Pool Library, was a graver omission. The final meeting lasted 25 minutes: Foot was for Rushdie, the rest of us were for Carey, so that was that. Rushdie has sometimes been caricatured as a bad loser, but at the ceremony he behaved impeccably and was generous in his praise of the winning book. All in all, a pleasing outcome. My other experiences of sitting on prize juries have been grisly in comparison.</p> <h2>1989 David Lodge</h2> <p>Our shortlist meeting was the longest to date, and much of it was taken up with discussion of Martin Amis\u2019s London Fields. It is public knowledge that two of the judges on the panel, Maggie Gee and Helen McNeil, successfully resisted its inclusion on the shortlist, an outcome I still regret. The final judging session was uncontroversial - all but one of us were unequivocally in favour of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Remains of the Day. I consider it one of the best Booker winners I have read. </p> <p>The success of the prize has had an enormous impact on the reception of literary fiction and other kinds of writing, not only directly, but also indirectly through the proliferation of new prizes that have imitated it. But the overtly competitive nature of these prizes, heightened by the publication of longlists and shortlists, takes its psychological toll on writers; and, given the large element of chance in the composition and operation of judging panels, the importance now attached to prizes in our literary culture seems excessive. A committee is a blunt instrument of literary criticism.</p> <h2>1990 Hilary Mantel </h2> <p>Not a discourteous word was exchanged between the hardworking 1990 judges - much to the disappointment of the administrator Martyn Goff, who praised us to our faces and later whined that we were boring. Denis Forman ran the meetings with smooth expertise, and largely kept his own opinions dark until he cast the final vote.</p> <p>Weeks before I was appointed a judge, I\u2019d read John McGahern\u2019s Amongst Women and said, reaching page 20, \u201cThis will win the Booker\u201d. So I was disappointed, but AS Byatt\u2019s Possession was a good book and a popular choice, and the discussion was fair. The process exhausted me, and I declined to do it a second time. What I despised was the leaking by the publicity machine of trivial non-stories to the press - I felt the prize had enough status and news value without that. I also believe the judges shouldn\u2019t review the books under consideration or talk about them in public, and in 1990 we didn\u2019t.</p> <p>I\u2019m glad I was a Booker judge relatively early in my career. It stopped me thinking that literary prizes are about literary value. Even the most correct jury goes in for horsetrading and gamesmanship, and what emerges is a compromise. </p> <p>For me the best of the Bookers is The Siege of Krishnapur. I read it again a few months ago and its supple humour, its insight, economy and narrative drive make it an enduring delight.</p> <h2>1991 Nicholas Mosley</h2> <p>I was asked to be a judge probably because I had just won the Whitbread the previous year. This had itself been a surprise, because it seemed I was out of favour with the literary establishment, having been labelled a \u201cnovelist of ideas\u201d while what was in favour was \u201cstyle\u201d. And style seemed most easily to be exhibited in stories that were outlandish, or grim, or quaint. I looked forward to judging the Booker because I thought I might give a boost to \u201cideas\u201d. There were five judges, and we had to choose six books out of 100 for the shortlist. I thought - well, surely, with this set-up I\u2019ll be able to squeeze in one choice of mine. But, in the event, I got none of my choices on to the list, because of the inflexibility of the voting system and of the other four judges, who were devotees of \u201cstyle\u201d. So I resigned, partly in a huff, but also because I thought that by so doing I might still be able to strike a blow for \u201cideas\u201d, as I might be asked to explain myself in the press - which I did.</p> <p>The winner chosen by the remaining judges was Ben Okri\u2019s The Famished Road - a beautifully written (yes) story of a boy in a west African village who goes to and fro between his family and the local witchdoctor. My choice would have been Allan Massie\u2019s The Sins of the Father, which confronted the issue of what was possible or impossible if the child of a notorious ex-Nazi and the child of a Jewish victim fell in love after the second world war. What could be forgiven, and by whom, and what could not. But these are controversial questions, and thus conventionally to be avoided.</p> <h2>1992 Victoria Glendinning</h2> <p>My fellow judges were John Coldstream, literary editor of the Telegraph, Harriet Harvey-Wood, literary director of the British Council, Valentine Cunningham and Mark Lawson. We became intimate in the way of people thrown together in a scary but non-fatal railway accident. John dreamt one night that he was Spartacus, with the Roman legions advancing on him in the form of piles of new titles. It was a vintage year for rent-a-sneer in the media. Prominent journalists whinged chauvinistically about \u201cfar-flung authors\u201d, deaf to the explosion of energy from Commonwealth novelists, which has been the most significant feature of the Booker\u2019s 40 years. The prize was \u201cessentially trivial\u201d, pontificated AN Wilson in contemptuous mode in the Evening Standard; and, enraged, I wrote to the Guardian letters page to contest Richard Gott\u2019s clich\u00e9s about the decline of the novel and what he called the \u201ctokenism\u201d of the inclusion of Mich\u00e8le Roberts on the shortlist.</p> <p>Every book on our shortlist had one passionate supporter and one furious antagonist. When at the final meeting we locked horns over the frontrunners, it was suggested that we should reach our decision by taking into account second choices - proportional representation. This procedure gave Michael Ondaatje (The English Patient) and Barry Unsworth (Sacred Hunger) equal points. I turned to Martyn Goff, sitting behind me discreetly - or as discreetly as anyone can who is wearing a gold satin tie - and asked if we could share the prize between the two. He conceded there was no rule against it. So that\u2019s what we did.</p> <p>Before the meeting, I was so unnerved that I left my bag with all my notes in it at the bank. When stressed I become sharp-tongued, and at one point told a fellow judge that he was a condescending bastard. My notes on our sessions are, at this distance in time, enigmatic. What in the world, for example, was Val Cunningham on about when he said: \u201cI am very interested in Huntley &amp; Palmer\u2019s biscuits and their role in literature\u201d? </p> <h2>1993 Gillian Beer</h2> <p>Olivier Todd, the French novelist, shrugged his shoulders at our second judges\u2019 meeting: no lunches with publishers, no approaches from agents, he complained - what an odd English bubble of propriety we were gathered inside. He was joking, but only just. And it is one of the remarkable things about being a Booker judge that no one tempts you with hospitality. You simply sit and read, and talk, and read again, over several months. The pleasure is in the reading, and in the talk. One of the rewards of going to see a new film is the conversation straight after, but reading new novels can be a lonely business. Not in this case. In 1993 I remember impassioned defences of books one of us had grown attached to, but no quarrels, just engrossing talk. Our chair, Grey Gowrie, came up with an ingenious criterion: novels must have \u201cradioactivity\u201d to stay in the running. He meant we must remember them weeks, months later. They mustn\u2019t fade. A self-proving criterion perhaps, but reassuring.</p> <p>One novel that certainly had that quality and yet just missed the shortlist was Trainspotting and it was in arguing about Irvine Welsh\u2019s book that we came nearest to quarrelling. Getting from long to shortlist was painful, worse than sorting out the winner among that final six. Some wanted the prize to go to David Malouf\u2019s Remembering Babylon, while Caryl Phillips\u2019s Crossing the River and Carol Shields\u2019s The Stone Diaries had strong support as well. But Roddy Doyle\u2019s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha won the day with its extraordinary technical achievement and its emotional force, taking us inside the voice and experience of a 10-year-old boy in the midst of family break-up.</p> <h2>1994 James Wood</h2> <p>After serving on the 1994 Booker prize committee, I made a pledge never to judge a big fiction prize again, and I have so far honoured it. We were a congenial group, and our chairman was not a former politician or bureaucrat but a distinguished literary critic (John Bayley); our meetings were friendly, and surely no less or more argumentative than those of other years. But the absurdity of the process was soon apparent: it is almost impossible to persuade someone else of the quality or poverty of a selected novel (a useful lesson in the limits of literary criticism). In practice, judge A blathers on about his favourite novel for five minutes, and then judge B blathers on about her favourite novel for five minutes, and nothing changes: no one switches sides. That is when the horse-trading begins. I remember that one of the judges phoned me and said, in effect: \u201cI know that you especially like novel X, and you know that I especially like novel Y. It would be good if both those books got on to the shortlist, yes? So if you vote for my novel, I\u2019ll vote for yours, OK?\u201d</p> <p>That is how our shortlist was patched together, and it is how our winner was chosen. It is how every shortlist is chosen, whether the premises are as explicit or not. I liked the winning book a great deal (James Kelman\u2019s How Late It Was, How Late) - it was one of my choices - and would have been happy with either that book or Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s The Folding Star. But I intensely disliked the way we reached that verdict, and felt that the arbitrary, utterly political process discredited the whole project.</p> <p>Since then, prizes have become a form of reviewing: it is prize-lists that select what people read, prize-lists that make literary careers. Bookshops order novels based on the prizes they have won or been shortlisted for. Nowadays, a whole month before the shortlist is announced, scores of novelists are effectively told that their books have not been the \u201cbig books\u201d of the year, because they are not to be found on the longlist. Soon, no doubt, we will have the long-longlist, and the long-long longlist. Some wonderful books win the Booker, of course, just as the flypaper occasionally catches some really large flies. But it means - or should mean - nothing in literary terms.</p> <h2>1995 Ruth Rendell</h2> <p>I was always being asked what it was like to be on the Booker \u201cjury\u201d. But I could never see us as that. Jurors have to decide between guilt and innocence while we had to pick the best. The best of 140 in our case - or 6.3 books a week. Reading that number is normal for me, but books I want to read, not ones I have to. It makes a big difference. We got on well, we judges. We disagreed but never quite quarrelled. I used to lie and say I read every word of every book. The truth is that I did my best, but I am a judicious skipper. Going home to Suffolk, I finished a novel and left it in the train. A man called out to me that I\u2019d forgotten it, but when I said to keep it he was delighted. I hope he liked it better than I did. </p> <p>So what did I get out of being a judge? The pleasure of giving the prize to Pat Barker\u2019s The Ghost Road, my choice, not one I was persuaded into. A mild antipathy to new novels so that now I tend to read more non-fiction. And my friendship with Peter Kemp, a fellow judge, which began in those Booker days. </p> <h2>1996 Jonathan Coe</h2> <p>How very arbitrary it seems, in retrospect. There was nothing wrong with our shortlist, and nothing wrong with our winner (Last Orders, by Graham Swift), but at 12 years\u2019 distance, it feels as though we could easily have chosen another six novels altogether. Our discussions were lengthy - and amicable, for the most part (until the final session, when tempers started to fray) - but what strikes me now about the whole process was how entirely subjective it was. Anyone who sets great store by the choices of Booker prize panels should remember this: the process consists of nothing more rigorous than five people sitting in a room together for a few hours, swapping personal opinions. And as far as I remember, not a single judge (including me) ever changed his or her mind, or shifted his or her position, in response to an argument put forward by a colleague. In the midst of it all, the novel which I now remember as being the finest of all - Asylum, by Patrick McGrath - slipped through our net, and failed to make the shortlist by a whisker. If it had reached the shortlist, such is the randomness of the final selection process, it might easily have won the prize itself.</p> <h2>1997 Jason Cowley</h2> <p>Before the longlist was made public, if you wanted to know which books were in contention you would usually be able to find out by having a discreet lunch with Martyn Goff, the charming and mischievous prize administrator who used to operate his own idiosyncratic system of leaks, withholding and revealing in equal measure. I remember turning up to the meeting at which our shortlist would be decided to be received with suspicion by our chairman, Gillian Beer. She wanted to know how our longlist was being discussed in the papers, and I was pretty sure by the way she looked at me that she thought I was responsible. Certainly I\u2019d been having fun writing polemical pieces about the state of the British novel. </p> <p>I believed then as I do now that the Booker is essentially a jamboree, little more than a kind of sport, with its own roster of winners and losers. It shouldn\u2019t be dignified or taken too seriously. But I wasn\u2019t the leaker. As we sat down for the lunch that preceded our discussions, and with Gillian Beer still grumbling about the longlist leaking out, I heard Goff say: \u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary. I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d He then, winningly, glanced at me and winked. </p> <p>I often think that I\u2019ve never quite recovered from my experience of being a judge. I began the year as an enthusiastic and engaged reader and reviewer of contemporary fiction, and ended it much more interested in non-fiction and narrative journalism. And of all the novels I read that year there are perhaps only two that I could ever imagine rereading: Arundhati Roy\u2019s The God of Small Things (our unfairly maligned winner) and Ian McEwan\u2019s Enduring Love (which just missed out on being shortlisted and divided the judges more than any other entry). </p> <h2>1998 Douglas Hurd</h2> <p>This was a quiet year. There were no sensational or overpowering entries, and no passionate disputes among the judges. The crafty device of holding the final meeting of the judges immediately before the award dinner certainly concentrated the mind. The prize went to Amsterdam by Ian McEwan, not because we thought it was about time he won the Booker, but because in a mild year most people (though not the chairman) thought his offering finished just ahead of Beryl Bainbridge, riding Master Georgie</p> <h2>1999 Shena Mackay</h2> <p>It was a very strong year for fiction. When I was a judge - alongside Boyd Tonkin, Natasha Walter and John Sutherland, with Gerald Kaufman in the chair - several books assumed to be shoo-ins weren\u2019t on the shortlist, which caused dismay, as did the discovery by some authors that their books had not been entered, on the presumption that the judges would call them in. We failed to do so. Sorry. Pressures of time and books arriving late.</p> <p>Our shortlisted authors were JM Coetzee, Anita Desai, Michael Frayn, Andrew O\u2019Hagan, Ahdaf Soueif and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. We gave the prize - controversially because he had won in 1983 - to Coetzee for Disgrace. We were vindicated recently when it was shortlisted for the Best of Bookers. John Sutherland was a strong advocate of Salman Rushdie (The Ground Beneath Her Feet) in our year, and he must be delighted that Midnight\u2019s Children has won the Booker of Bookers for the second time.</p> <p>Our chief dispute arose from John\u2019s gadfly comments in this newspaper. As far as I remember, it was the suggestion that Natasha Walter and I had a feminist agenda which prompted Natasha to write a letter to the Guardian, which I signed. Being a judge gave me much more anxiety than being on the shortlist myself, even with the horrible bookies\u2019 odds and the risk of being depicted as a cartoon racehorse, because as a judge you are responsible for disappointing a lot of people.</p> <h2>2000 Rose Tremain</h2> <p>My second stint as a Booker prize judge contrasted with the first in one important respect: we had an extremely effective and powerful chair in Simon Jenkins. In 1988, the lovable Michael Foot had been hampered, as chair, by diary overspill. But Simon\u2019s influence on the 2000 jury was impressive. Meetings were held at his rooms in Albany, rather than at Martyn Goff\u2019s preferred venue of the Savile Club. Despite the constant lamentations of his fax machine, Simon\u2019s attention never strayed from the tasks in hand, the first of which was to kick out the dross. Roy Foster, Caroline Gascoigne, Mariella Frostrup and I were a vocal team and we each had our favourites. Mariella was able to squeeze Matthew Kneale\u2019s English Passengers on to the list, and Caroline\u2019s advocacy for Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s When We Were Orphans was duly recognised. Roy Foster and I lost our battle for Anne Enright\u2019s What Are You Like?, but my call-in title, Trezza Azzopardi\u2019s The Hiding Place, scraped home. </p> <p>What is really interesting is that nobody thought Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Blind Assassin was her best book. Where Simon\u2019s mental agility paid off was in persuading us all (except Mariella) that Atwood deserved the prize anyway - for all the times she\u2019d nearly won it and had been pipped at the post by a lesser writer. </p> <h2>2001 Philip Hensher</h2> <p>It\u2019s an unusual experience, reading for the Booker. For once in your life you take a synchronic slice through the English-language novel, and see exactly what\u2019s interesting it at that moment. I was lucky in having an excellent chairman in Kenneth Baker, unprejudiced, interested and diligent, and fellow judges who really knew about the novel - Kate Summerscale was particularly good to argue with. I think we made a good choice with Peter Carey\u2019s substantial True History of the Kelly Gang, but the whole shortlist was, in my view, exceptional. I regretted that media excitement over Beryl Bainbridge actually damaged her chances with According to Queeney. We realised that if we shortlisted her, she had to win. There was no point in blotting out the winner\u2019s publicity with a storm of \u201cBeryl Bridesmaid Again\u201d headlines. I wanted to do more for Nick Hornby\u2019s How to Be Good, and it was a relief that the Whitbread rewarded Philip Pullman\u2019s The Amber Spyglass, which we could easily have shortlisted. It was a good-humoured, interesting experience, but what I got most out of it was being introduced to new novelists - Zvi Jagendorf, Ciaran Carson, Jamie O\u2019Neill - however far they got in the judging process. </p> <p>The best novel to have been given the prize is, I think, Naipaul\u2019s In a Free State in 1971. </p> <h2>2002 Salley Vickers</h2> <p>I was a judge the year Life of Pi won, and there is no doubt that our choice was a rip-roaring popular success. The booksellers loved us for it. It was me, in fact, who first drew the other judges\u2019 attention to the novel. I was given it while on tour in Canada, by a Winnipeg bookseller, and read it excitedly on the plane home. We used to have extra meetings at the home of our chair, Lisa Jardine, and I recall telling all the other judges - Erica Wagner, Russell Celyn Jones and David Baddiel - about the book, which at that time had not been entered by Canongate. I was very glad to see it on to the shortlist, but it was not my final choice (the other books on the shortlist were Rohinton Mistry\u2019s Family Matters, Carol Shields\u2019s Unless, William Trevor\u2019s The Story of Lucy Gault, Sarah Waters\u2019s Fingersmith and Tim Winton\u2019s Dirt Music). However, Lisa was a skilled chair. She wanted a unanimous verdict and, much as I admired the book, I couldn\u2019t give her that. So she said, \u201cSalley, it was you who brought the book to our attention. Will you give the decision your blessing?\u201d Well, I couldn\u2019t refuse.</p> <h2>2003 DJ Taylor</h2> <p>I can\u2019t say that I enjoyed reading all the books - 113 of them, I believe, in that year - but there was a certain amount of pleasure to be gained from the attendant razzmatazz, the thought that for a very brief period in the year an artefact routinely overlooked by large swathes of an indifferent media was suddenly news. There were several memorable clashes of opinion, the funniest by far coming when the chair, John Carey, trying desperately to persuade us of the merits of Martin Amis\u2019s Yellow Dog, read aloud from a paragraph describing the death-throes of a dying fly, at which point Francine Stock and I caught each other\u2019s eye across the table and began to giggle. The judging process was pretty much a waste of time as all four of the other judges arrived at the longlist meeting convinced that DBC Pierre\u2019s Vernon God Little was one of the great masterpieces of the early 21st century, whereas I thought that it was a promising first novel. This meant that the final judging session lasted a bare 10 minutes, after which I had to sit discussing the existence (or non-existence) of God with AC Grayling, a subject on which both of us hold strong views.</p> <h2>2004 Tibor Fischer</h2> <p>I\u2019d heard the rumours. The hair-pulling, the eye-gouging, the shameful flouncing. I was, however, extremely impressed by the rigour of my fellow judges, who, unlike me, had proper jobs and families to distract them from the mound of books. What did I learn? Discussion is futile. No one changes their mind about a book. You might as well have a show of hands straight away. There aren\u2019t many bad books (only one novel ended up in the bin after two pages), but there are a lot of so-so, nondescript novels that leave no trace. Publishers are idiots. I was very pleased Alan Hollinghurst won. But I wouldn\u2019t say The Line of Beauty is a better novel than David Mitchell\u2019s very different Cloud Atlas (which came in second) or Neil Cross\u2019s Always the Sun (or others on the longlist).</p> <p>There are good reasons why Midnight\u2019s Children has been chosen as the Best of the Bookers (although every novelist I know rates Shame as Rushdie\u2019s best book), but it would have been a more interesting exercise to have chosen the best of the shortlisted novels. It\u2019s a pity that Beryl Bainbridge has always been pipped, and my favourite novel in the Booker annals (I\u2019ve read it at least a dozen times) is Derek Robinson\u2019s Goshawk Squadron</p> <h2>2005 John Sutherland</h2> <p>When I chaired year 37, it more or less, as airline pilots say, flew by wire. The year was, by general agreement, a bumper one for fiction. As usual, no minds were much changed by the panel discussions - candidate B merely came forward when one judge\u2019s candidate A was voted down. John Banville came out top with The Sea. King of the As and Bs. Teeth were gnashed in the press the next day; but they would be if Jesus Christ had written the winning novel. I spoke to Kazuo Ishiguro (shortlisted for Never Let Me Go) shortly after. \u201cThe goalkeeper jumped the wrong way\u201d, he sportingly said. I wish I\u2019d been quick-witted enough to rejoin \u201cnot even Petr Cech has to save five penalty shots all coming at him at once\u201d. Julian Barnes, in an interview for the New York Times, was more savage (he had been shortlisted for Arthur &amp; George). Not, he felt, a bumper year for judges. Perhaps he was right. But posterity will forget us. Barnes, Ishiguro and - I believe - Banville they\u2019ll remember. And make their own judgments. </p> <h2>2006 Anthony Quinn</h2> <p>I enjoyed every moment of the 2006 Booker until the very last minutes of our final meeting in the Guildhall. That was when I realised that the novel which I had set my heart on would not be the winner. On anecdotal evidence from friends who had judged the prize in previous years, I gathered that there was usually someone on the jury who would be a complete pest and make the whole process as awkward as possible. Not this time: our chairman, Hermione Lee, set a tone of almost heartless conviviality that Candia McWilliam, Fiona Shaw and Simon Armitage consistently upheld. Indeed, we had been so likeminded in the final reckoning of our shortlist that I must have blanked the ominous build-up of support for Kiran Desai\u2019s The Inheritance of Loss and assumed that everyone would come round to what was clearly the best book, Edward St Aubyn\u2019s Mother\u2019s Milk. When I was outvoted 4-1 I was surprised, and appalled. Six months of reading and re-reading - only to be thwarted at the last! I asked for a recount, which at least got a laugh. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that I felt sick to my stomach. I was pleased for Kiran Desai, who\u2019d spent eight years writing it. But we chose the wrong book. </p> <h2>2007 Giles Foden</h2> <p>Everyone expected arguments, and we had them, but with dignity (my fellow judges were Howard Davies, Wendy Cope, Ruth Scurr and Imogen Stubbs). We never fell out. In fact, we are meeting up this autumn for a drink. Some had their favourites that others couldn\u2019t stand; others tried to hold up yardsticks against which all books might be measured. The favourite supporters made persuasive cases for AN Wilson and Nicola Barker, but only Barker got through to the shortlist, despite an unfortunate error in transmission - not the judges\u2019 fault - which suggested Wilson had. The longlist is where the real argy-bargy takes place. </p> <p>Once an author is on the shortlist anything can happen. In our case we arrived at a situation in which every judge had mutually exclusive first and last choices. Luckily, in Howard Davies we had a competent chairman, who helped us mathematically towards a choice of winner with which everyone was happy. PS: note to publishers, try not to write call-in letters with spelling mistakes, or one that make foolish claims. Some of these letters looked as if they were written in haste. Then again, so did some of the novels submitted.</p> <h2>2008 Alex Clark</h2> <p>Before I was asked to judge this year\u2019s prize, I had been on several literary prize panels and I felt I had enough experience to know roughly what I was doing. But little can prepare you for the Booker: not just the sheer volume of books submitted, but the sense that you are about to be partly responsible for making an indelible mark on the literary landscape. Now, with the final hurdle fast approaching, I can say that it\u2019s been not only an enjoyable process but also an instructive one. Reading is, of course, a solitary affair, and book reviewing not much less so. But anatomising one\u2019s taste and judgment and then communicating it to a group of people with equally strong views has been a wonderful challenge - not least because it makes for scrutiny of what it is that one values in fiction. And, gruelling though it was, I wouldn\u2019t give up those late nights and early mornings spent poring over novels.</p> <h2>2009 John Mullan</h2> <p>My fellow judges were Lucasta Miller Jim Naughtie, Sue Perkins and Michael Prodger. I do confess that I already knew, at least slightly, all the other judges. Did this make it too cosy? Maybe, but the process is enough of a challenge to make conviviality a useful blessing. It felt as if there was rather little disagreement until the end, when suddenly it was sharp. On the very day of the dinner, you get shut in a room with sandwiches and orange juice, and chip away at your short list. I would have been happy to see Sarah Waters\u2019s The Little Stranger win, and I think in another year it might have done. But it came down to Wolf Hall versus Summertime: Mantel versus Coetzee.</p> <p>Two of the other judges, Lucasta and Sue, have written elsewhere of their<br>preference for Coetzee, so the voting can hardly be a secret. What I had not expected was that my cards would be the last to go on the table. </p> <p>Being a natural loudmouth, I had been trying to speak judiciously, and had ended up seeming to be biding my moment.

  "<h2>Who should I call for a makeover?</h2> <p><strong>I recently bought a second-floor flat, and need to get it rewired and replumbed. I would also like to open up the kitchen to the living room and install a new kitchen, boiler and central heating - and I'd like it all done as green as possible. The bathroom and kitchen are at opposite ends of the flat, so routing of plumbing and wiring will be tricky. Who do I need to help me? An architect, structural engineer, separate plumber/electrician/builder? I'm baffled!</strong></p> <p>Let's separate the issues. You're not adding volume to your property or interfering with exterior or party walls, so the good news is you're not in the realm of planning permission or even permitted development. But you will have to deal with building regulations, because you're opening up between kitchen and lounge, and there are rules governing fire doors, ventilation, etc. An architect could design the layout, put the job out to tender, project manage it, and deal with any rules and regs - but they don't come cheap: expect to pay a percentage of the overall build cost (about 13% or more). For small jobs, this can be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut (you don't want to spend \u00a310,000 on an architect when your budget's \u00a360,000, say). </p> <p>An architect is really of use when you have no idea how to design a space. You, however, sound as if you know what you want to do. A professional builder used to jobs on this scale should be able to work from your sketches. He'll deal with any structural issues and have plumbers, joiners, electricians, etc, who work with him. You want someone who comes with a recommendation, so visit a property he's recently worked on and talk to the owner. </p> <p>If the wall you're taking down is a serious structural element, you may need an engineer to design 'the steels', or supports, which will go in in its absence. But, again, the advice of a good builder is invaluable. </p> <p>As for your wish to be green, well, replacing your central heating is a good start because you'll upgrade to an efficient system with condensing boiler. If your flat is in the eaves, make sure the roof is well insulated, too.</p> <h2>Can we save our quarry tiles?</h2> <p><strong>The kitchen in our late-Victorian house has its original quarry-tiled floor - sadly covered by the </strong><strong>previous occupants' carpet and, under that, lino glued to the tiles. We'd love to restore them. Could we do it ourselves, or would we be better off calling in a professional?</strong></p> <p>Our DIY expert, Bridget Bodoano, says, 'It's a pretty big job, and messy, but it can be done. Nigel Frost of The Floor Restoration Company (01432 851138, <a href=\"http://www.floor-restoration.co.uk\">floor-restoration.co.uk</a>) says first remove the remnants of lino with a strong metal scraper, then the glue, much of which can be removed with a hot-air gun (about \u00a325, from DIY shops), which will loosen the glue. You'll need a number of scrapers and a fireproof container for the debris. Wear strong gloves (not plastic) and a chemical gas mask, because the fumes may be toxic. Ensure the room has plenty of ventilation and don't use near combustible materials. Remove any remaining glue with abrasive pads, plenty of clean cloths and, if necessary, cellulose thinners.</p> <p>Next, you may find you need to re-grout. Also, if any tiles need replacing, source them from reclamation and salvage yards. Last, scrub the floor, either by hand or machine; if there is still some residue on the surface, use a strong stripper such as Selate Floor Polish Stripper (\u00a35.50, 0845 226 7275, <a href=\"http://www.cleansave.co.uk\">cleansave.co.uk</a>). Wash well and leave to dry out for at least a week before applying a breathable sealer such as Dry-treat Stain-proof (about \u00a340, 0800 634 8860, <a href=\"http://www.tf-direct.co.uk\">tf-direct.co.uk</a>). </p> <p>'If, after all that, you decide to get it done professionally, The Floor Restoration Company charges about \u00a31,400 plus VAT for a 4m sq area.' </p> <h2>You respond</h2> <p>Re My Jewellery Gets All Tangled Up (August 2), the winner for me is US-based Ginny's Ear Nest (<a href=\"http://www.ear-nest.com)\">ear-nest.com)</a>, whose necklace rack hangs on the inside of wardrobe doors, and costs about \u00a330, plus \u00a330 shipping. <br><strong>Anna Garner</strong> Bath</p> <p>I couldn't help but snigger at the helpful (and expensive) ways to store jewellery.

  "<p>Williams's eight previous novels have been object lessons in the synthesis of setting and characterisation, and this strength is on display again in a rich, textured story of political intrigue on a far-future Mars. Winterstrike and Caud are hostile, ice-bound cities on the terraformed red planet ruled by the Matriarch, a political regime that has rid the world of men, who exist now as little more than animals in the hinterlands. Hestia Mar is a Winterstrike spy in the city of Caud, attempting to uncover evidence that will defuse the imminent war, while Essegui Harn, her cousin in Winterstrike, becomes ever more embroiled in her disgraced sister's involvement with the devolved male of the species. What they discover unveils ancient secrets and transforms the planet's destiny for ever. Winterstrike is beautifully written, seamlessly plotted and profound.</p>",
  "<p>The problem with life is you never know when those significant cultural events might happen. The amount of \"if onlys\" that stack up over the decades as moments from your childhood are replayed on I Love programmes. Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard have a novel way of dealing with this. Too young to remember the Cramps' 1978 concert in a mental asylum, they just reconstruct it. They did the same with David Bowie's final stage show as Ziggy Stardust. And they don't confine themselves to pop. Bruce Nauman and Vito Acconci get a makeover, too, quite literally in Nauman's case. Their last tribute to the iconic video artist was a re-interpretation of his seminal piece Art Make-Up, in which they photographed the performers of a KISS tribute band applying their face paint. Having recently completed a pop video for Nick Cave featuring cameos by Will Self and Peaches Geldof, their exhibition will be a hotly anticipated affair; just make sure you remember it (or take a camera).</p>",
  "<p>I can remember the day he told the manager that he was leaving. He just went up to him one day in training and said: 'I'm packing the game in in six weeks' time.' We were all in shock when we heard because it was completely out of character. He was always a bit of a jack-the-lad. He'd just bought a brand new MG sports car and put his name on the side. It just seemed so unlikely.</p> <p>What people forget is that he was a very, very special player. We had a good team then and he was probably the best player in it. If he'd continued playing I think we would have won things. He was a good passer of the ball, had two good feet and could strike the ball really cleanly. He scored a lot of goals and had intelligence with it - he was one of those players who, when through on goal, you really fancied him to score.</p> <p>It's a crying shame. They were saying he might go to Mexico for the World Cup the following summer, but he just gave it all away. It was a bloody waste of talent, to tell the truth. There are kids who would give their right arm to have that kind of ability, and there he was walking out of the sport. That summer Bill Shankly wanted to sign him for Liverpool but he turned them down. Of course we all understood why a few weeks later.</p> <p>He never said a word to any of us about it. I did try to talk to him one day, but he wasn't interested. We thought it was because of his girlfriend, who I think had been involved with the Jehovah's Witnesses before, so we thought at the time it was all a bit of a gimmick. We all thought he'd be back in six weeks or eight weeks and we laughed it off. After about a year or so we realised he wasn't coming back.</p> <p>I still remember his last game, against Nottingham Forest. We were winning 3-0 at half-time and it ended up 3-3 - one of their players got a hat-trick in the second half. And that was it. After the game he just left the ground and didn't come back. There were no big goodbyes. It was very strange.</p> <p>He used to work stacking shelves at Marks and Spencer. Maybe he still does. A few years ago I had a stroke and Peter came to visit me in hospital. I have to say, whenever I've seen him since he's looked very happy and content. Who's to say that he made the wrong choice?</p> <h2>Then what happened</h2> <p>Knowles turned 24 three weeks after the Nottingham Forest game, his last in professional football. Wolves retained his registration until 1982 in the hope that he would return. In 1991 Billy Bragg released a song, God's Footballer, inspired by Peter Knowles' story. Munro retired in 1979 and still lives in Wolverhampton.</p>",
  "<p>Our capricious British weather doesn't always lend itself to evenings in the garden, so it's no surprise that sales of patio heaters have rocketed in recent years. But as their impact on the environment has been realised (one hour of heating a 12.5kw model uses the same energy as making 400 cups of tea), the backlash has begun. B&amp;Q, the UK's largest seller of patio heaters, and the garden centre chains Notcutts and Wyevale have all agreed to stop stocking them. </p> <p>So what are the alternatives? Pile on extra layers and light a fire. An attractively designed fireplace will make a focal point in the garden, even when unlit; if you prefer something portable, go for a simple firepit or a cast-iron chiminea. </p> <p>As for fuel, use hardwood and charcoal that's sustainably managed and preferably produced locally, such as BioRegional Local Seasoned Firewood (\u00a33.98 for 10kg) and Charcoal (\u00a34.98 for 3kg) from B&amp;Q (0845 609 6688, <a href=\"http://www.diy.com\">diy.com</a>). Don't use treated wood, as it will give off toxic chemicals, and recycle the ash by digging into your borders once a year or mixing it into the compost bin.</p> <p>Stand the fireplace on a flat, non-combustible surface (ie not a wooden deck) and use a mesh guard if possible. Watch for sheds, fences and overhanging trees. Never use accelerants and keep children away.</p> <h2>Chimineas</h2> <p>Chimineas radiate heat from the neck as well as the opening - the bigger the opening, the easier it is to refill and cook with (most can be fitted with a grill). Smoke is drawn up through the neck, so these are the best fires for a windy day. They can have openings of 3m or more and weigh as much as 95kg, so you may need a wheeled trolley to move them. </p> <p>Clay chimineas originate from Mexico, where the Mayans used them as outdoor ovens for cooking and heating. They are easily cracked, so it's best not to move them around too much and don't expose them to extremes of temperature - cover or take in during winter, and fit a cap when not in use to stop water collecting inside. Insulate with sand or pea gravel; seal and season by making the first few fires small. You will get longer life from one reinforced with wire mesh.</p> <p>Cast-iron and cast-aluminium chimineas are the sturdiest and give off the greatest amount of heat - the sides can stay hot for some time after the fire has burned down. Cast-iron chimineas will rust unless kept dry, but are frost-proof and long-lasting. </p> <p><strong>Clay Reza Sol</strong> Large chiminea with sunburst motif and hanging candle which glows inside when fire is not in use.

They have an open design and generally a small diameter, so they give gentle heat rather than a big blaze, but they are quick and easy to get going, many are fitted with a pan to catch the ash and they can be used as a barbecue if burning charcoal or wood. Some can be closed off when not lit, so double as a low table, and they come in a range of materials and styles.</p> <p><strong>Black steel firebowl</strong> in classic round design; comes with grill pan and mesh guard.

H: 55cm x Dia: 66cm; \u00a389, from Mode (0870 240 3606, <a href=\"http://www.mode.co.uk\">mode.co.uk</a>). </p> <h2>Braziers and baskets</h2> <p>These give off more heat, as they tend to be taller and hold more fuel. Traditionally forged by blacksmiths and used for farm jobs such as melting pitch. Some come with a grill for barbecuing, but wear protective gloves to cook as the heat radiates up and out. Most are made of mild steel, so prone to surface rusting.</p> <p><strong>Le Brazier solid steel BBQ </strong>Comes with grill pan, charcoal pan and ash pan. H: 80cm x Dia: 36cm; \u00a3399, made to order by blacksmith Guy Jones (01691 683827, <a href=\"http://www.lebrazierbbq.com\">lebrazierbbq.com</a>). </p> <p><strong>Moroccan fire basket</strong> in black finished steel, with grill pan.

  "<p><em>Today's meetings at <strong>Leopardstown</strong>, <strong>Haydock</strong> and <strong>Stratford</strong> have all been abandoned because of waterlogged tracks. The much-anticipated Irish Champion Stakes, in which Duke of Marmalade and New Approach were due to go head-to-head, will be run tomorrow.</em></p> <p><em>The only surviving meetings on Saturday are those at Wolverhampton and Kempton Park.</em></p> <p><em>Chris Cook's tips were written before the abandonment of Saturday's major meetings.</em></p> <h2>Take New Approach for Champion</h2> <br> <p>With five Group One wins from five starts, Duke Of Marmalade has been the standout talent this Flat season and, though his latest two wins have both been by less than a length, his margin of superiority appeared greater. He has no obvious weaknesses for today's Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown and has twice run to form on soft ground.</p> <p>But Aidan O'Brien's words of caution this week, to the effect that the colt may not have recovered from his Newmarket exertions, are off-putting and it could well be that he needs a break.</p> <p><strong>New Approach (3.50)</strong>, by contrast, was coming back from an injury enforced break when beaten by Duke Of Marmalade last time. He looked outpaced on decent going that day and should do much better here, now that persistent rain has turned Leopardstown into a quagmire.</p> <p><strong>Haydock 2.05</strong> <strong>Lady Deauville</strong> is the ideal candidate, having already won four times at this level, each time on ground with some cut. She gives the impression that it can never be too soft for her.</p> <p><strong>Leopardstown 2.10</strong> <strong>Famous Name</strong> makes his eagerly awaited reappearance after looking a most unlucky runner-up in the French Derby. It is hard to see past him.</p> <p><strong>Kempton 2.20</strong> <strong>Elnawin</strong> apparently caught connections by surprise when landing a valuable sales race at Newmarket and that's easily the best form on offer here.</p> <p><strong>Haydock 2.35</strong> <strong>Strike Up The Band</strong> had been knocking on the door before his Shergar Cup triumph and should take all the beating again. He is still 9lb lower than his career high rating.</p> <p><strong>Leopardstown 2.40</strong> <strong>Carribean Sunset</strong> beat Halfway To Heaven in a Guineas trial round here and looked unlucky not to confirm the form in the Irish 1,000 the following month. Dermot Weld's filly showed her liking for some give when hammering Blythe Knight in a Group Three here last time and is preferred to her two more fancied rivals. Lush Lashes must prove her ability to cope with the surface, having been well beaten on the only occasion she encountered anything like it.</p> <p><strong>Kempton 2.50</strong> <strong>Blue Monday</strong> is the proven performer at Group Three level and he almost certainly needed his first outing for nine months when last seen. The only concern is his lack of racing experience on a synthetic surface.</p> <p><strong>Haydock 3.10</strong> US Ranger has disappointed on this sort of surface in the past, while Equiano will probably struggle to sustain his effort over six furlongs on heavy. <strong>Utmost Respect</strong> is the one for whom everything has fallen right and he looked worth his place at this level when an unlucky fourth behind Marchand D'Or at Deauville last month.</p> <p><strong>Kempton 3.25</strong> The form of <strong>Premio Loco's</strong> victory here over Rose Street was boosted when that one followed up and he has more scope to be ahead of the handicapper than most of these.</p> <p><strong>Haydock 3.40</strong> Successful over this course and distance in July, when the going was similarly desperate, <strong>Bollin Felix</strong> can prove best in what will be a war of attrition</p> <h2>Ron Cox's tip of the day</h2> <br> <p><strong>Green Park</strong> 2.35 Haydock</p> <p>Richard Fahey's runner bounced back to form last time when a length second to Divine Spirit at Beverley, making up late ground to be nearest at the finish. Now the ground has come in his favour he should be followed as he is on a very favourable handicap mark still 3lb below the one off which he won the ultra-competitive Gosforth Park Cup last term on similarly heavy ground.</p> <h2>Horse sense</h2> <br> <p><strong>Marmalade supporters may come to a sticky end</strong></p> <p>The consensus about Duke Of Marmalade's midweek drift in the market for today's Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown is that punters were worried about the rain. However, word reaches us that the colt disappointed in his work and may not have recovered from his recent Newmarket outing. Meanwhile, Multidimensional (3.50) worked extremely well before travelling over and is no forlorn hope.</p> <p>Today's major talking horse is Ethaara (4.30) at Kempton. William Haggas's filly beat a fancied runner from the John Gosden yard at Great Leighs last time and the pair were well clear. The race was no doubt hard for the handicapper to assess but there is a strong feeling that he has erred on the side of leniency and she will be well supported.</p> <p>On the same card, Cape Hawk (3.25) and Elnawin (2.20) are expected to carry on Richard Hannon's excellent recent run, while Blue Monday (2.50) will be better for his reappearance. Captain Ramius (4.00) is the pick of an intriguing bunch for the conditions race. Sir Michael Stoute's debutant, Standpoint, is ordinary, while Ashram's willingness is not to be taken on trust.</p> <p>Connections of Corrybrough (3.10) are hoping that Haydock's card goes ahead, so that their zippy three-year-old can prove his Deauville defeat, when he got a poor ride, was not his true form. We also have a good word for La Brigitte (4.15), who will love the going.</p> <p>Cruikadyke (4.45) is not so certain to enjoy conditions but is also in very good heart. Paul Cole's yard are also expecting a big run from Via Mia (2.10) at Bath's meeting on Monday.</p> <p>Looking ahead to next weekend's St Leger, we are advised that Centennial has been working the house down after his surprise victory in the restaged Great Voltigeur. The rain has come for him and connections will presumably supplement the grey.</p> <p>William Jarvis's Gravitation (2.00) is in good shape ahead of Thursday's Park Hill Stakes, while Absent Pleasure (1.30) is one to look out for in Wednesday's nursery event.</p> <p>Ignotus, a successful hurdler for Alan Swinbank last season, has finally passed a stalls test and is being lined up for a run on the Flat. The gelding is reckoned a sure-fire winner of a 1m4f maiden.</p> <h2>Seen and heard</h2> <br> <p>Gary Moore will probably be glad to see the back of Mourilyan, who has his first run for him in a Group Three at Kempton today. The horse is owned by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, whose private army have faced repeated accusations of murder, kidnapping and torture - as Moore has now discovered, having googled his owner's name. \"Scary - I hope he runs well,\" says the trainer. The British Horseracing Authority confirm that Kadyrov passed their tests to be an owner. Mourilyan will leave Moore for good when he flies to Australia for the Melbourne Cup.</p> <p>Credit crunch or no, it seems Yorkshire racegoers aren't short of a bob or two. Eyebrows were raised at the entry prices for next week's St Leger meeting at Doncaster, but the Premier Suite (capacity 350) has already sold out for the last three days, despite charging \u00a360 per head and \u00a375 on Saturday. The County Enclosure (\u00a350) has also sold out for St Leger day.</p> <p>Last week, we passed on a rumour that the jockey Neil Callan was considering an end to his partnership with the trainer Kevin Ryan, who has provided 29 of his 108 winners this year. Callan has since contacted us to categorically deny that he has any such thoughts.</p> <p>Committed Arsenal fan Frankie Dettori's allegiance may be wobbling. He wore a blue suit this week to the opening of Frankie's Sports Bar . . . at Stamford Bridge stadium, home of Chelsea.</p>",
  "<p>There is a striking similarity between Barack Obama and his new nemesis, Sarah Palin - and it's not just that they are both big on basketball. They have equally set out on what Obama likes to call an \"improbable journey\" that will see one of them make it all the way to the White House on November 4.</p> <p>In Palin's case, the improbable journey began here: a sprawling wooden compound that looks like a cross between an oversized McDonald's and a prison complex. It occupies a patch of barren ground on the edge of Wasilla, the tiny town in Alaska in which she spent her childhood and cut her political teeth. Above the entrance a banner announces that this is the home of the Wasilla Assembly of God, motto: \"To know Him, and to make Him known!\"</p> <p>It was here Palin was baptised, or \"saved\", as she describes it, and later had her children baptised. It was here she was inducted into the peculiar rituals of her fundamentalist faith - the charismatic preaching, the laying on of hands, the tears and cries of joy of the Pentecostal church. \"I grew up in the Wasilla Assembly of God,\" she once said. \"Nothing freaks me out about the worship service.\"</p> <p>On the night I visit the church, the congregation is huddled in a group, arms raised or clasped around each other, as the senior pastor, Ed Kalnins, leads them in prayer. \"Lord, we know that you have made this church a platform,\" he exclaims. \"You are using the wonderful Governor Palin to get your message of the gospel across.\"</p> <p>Pastor Ed, as his flock calls him, moved to Wasilla in 1999 - three years after the town elected Palin as its mayor. What struck him the first time they met, he has said, was that in her eyes religion came first, politics second. He thought to himself: \"This person loves Jesus. That's the bottom line. She loves Jesus with everything she has. She is a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ before she is the mayor. Sarah Palin is the real deal.\"</p> <p>Pastor Ed's language may be colourful. But he has put his finger on a central truth about the woman who in two months' time could become the next vice-president of the US. From her earliest days at the bottom of the political ladder in minuscule Wasilla, through to her sudden rise this week into international stardom, she has always been on a mission.</p> <p>Her trajectory has run in parallel with that of her party. Her career took off precisely at the moment when the Christian right seized control of the Republican movement, casting out the fiscal conservatives who had traditionally held sway with their focus on such worldly matters as low taxes and small government.</p> <p>The shift in the party's focus from mammon to God is illustrated perfectly in Palin's successful campaign to become mayor in 1996. All previous elections had revolved around such existential questions as how to improve the pavements and get litter off the streets. She ignored all that, campaigning instead against abortion and gun control and casting aspersions on her (Republican) opponent about his infrequent attendance of church.</p> <p>Victoria Naegele was editor of the local paper, The Frontiersman, at the time and can recall the shock of the Palin revolution. \"I remember thinking 'Wow! Are religious issues really germane to the job of being mayor of a town of just 5,000 people?'\"</p> <p>Naegele remembers vividly too a second shockwave that came swiftly after Palin's election. Instead of easing her way into the role, she went in with guns blazing, demanding that six of the department heads of the council - none of them political appointments, several with many years' service - submit their resignations. When Naegele protested through the editorial columns of the paper at what she saw as the new mayor's heavy-handed style, she felt the heat. \"It was a difficult time. I was lambasted as a liberal, when in fact I am a Christian conservative Republican, just like Sarah Palin.\"</p> <p>Then, in an incident that is fast turning into the stuff of political legend, Palin was revealed earlier this week to have attempted to censor Wasilla's library. The idea is almost laughable when you see the library itself. Its small collection of books includes a prominent section on hunting and fishing, and no visible copies of Lady Chatterley's Lover. Yet in 1996, after parents complained about a book their child had taken home, Palin took umbrage. Frustratingly, no one can remember the volume concerned. What we do know is that Palin turned on the then librarian, Mary Ellen Emmons, asking her in a council meeting what she would do if she were told by the mayor to remove certain books from the collection.</p> <p>Local resident Anne Kilkenny was in the public gallery and heard the librarian's reaction: \"She sucked in her breath, and replied that the books in the library were all acquired in accordance with professional criteria and she would resist completely.\"</p> <p>Palin has since claimed her question was purely rhetorical. That is not how Naegele and Kilkenny perceived it at the time. A few weeks later, Palin sent Emmons a letter terminating her employment. \"People in the town rose up in anger,\" Kilkenny recalls. \"The library is an important institution in our city, as there's not a lot else to do here in the winter but sit by the fire with a good book. There was real public pressure, and Sarah was forced to rescind the letter.\"</p> <p>Emmons survived. Others were less fortunate. The museum director, city planner and public works director all quit within months of Palin's ascendancy, and the police chief was sacked outright (he sued for wrongful dismissal but lost). Palin said the turnover was needed to clean out the \"old boys' club\". Others were not so sure.</p> <p>Again, she was utterly in tune with the trajectory of her party. By the end of the 1990s the Republican leadership had adopted a modus operandi that also combined religious zealotry with managerial ruthlessness. Yet this development was not without its detractors within the party. One of the loudest critics was the very man who has put Palin on the national stage: John McCain. Paradoxically, it was partly his disdain for the grip that TV preachers came to hold over the Republicans that earned him a reputation as a maverick.</p> <p>Since then, Palin has travelled a huge distance in her journey towards the White House. Two years ago she became Alaska's first female governor, with some of the most valuable natural resources in the US under her control. Stylistically, she's become much more sophisticated. But under the surface, the way of operating has changed little.</p> <p>The religious mission is still front and centre of her politics. She opposes abortion in all cases other than those in which the mother would die if she were to give birth. She is a vocal opponent of gay marriage, and advocate of the teaching of anti-evolutionary creationism, or \"intelligent design\", in schools.</p> <p>Her religious beliefs extend to a conviction that the Iraq war is God's will. When she returned to Wasilla in June to pray with her old congregation, she said of the troops being posted to Iraq, including her own son, Track: \"Our national leaders are sending them out on a task from God. We have to pray there is a plan and that it's God's plan.\"</p> <p>Most poignantly, she will not countenance sex education for teenagers, preferring instead to preach that abstinence is the only complete protection against pregnancy or venereal disease. It would be a cheap shot to suggest that this week's bombshell revelation that her 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, is herself pregnant was Palin's comeuppance.</p> <p>But it would not be unfair to point out that Alaska has the highest per capita incidence of chlamydia in the country, and that the rate of teenage pregnancies across the US, including within her state, has just risen for the first time in 14 years - a trend many blame on George Bush's preferment of abstinence-only education. \"It's frustrating we aren't doing more to inform our children,\" said Brittany Goodnight of the Alaska branch of Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>If the religious flame still burns bright, so too does the ruthless determination. In an echo of what happened to the librarian and police chief in Wasilla all those years ago, Palin is embroiled in a full-scale investigation by the Alaskan state legislature into allegations that she sacked the safety commissioner because he in turn refused to act against a police officer whom Palin wanted dismissed. </p> <p>The officer, Mike Wooten, was the governor's former brother-in-law, who had been through an acrimonious divorce from her sister. Palin, her husband, Todd, and several of her aides tried to convince the commissioner, Walter Monegan, to fire Wooten, but he refused.</p> <p>The casualties scattered along Palin's path continue to mount. Lyda Green, a neighbour of Palin's in Wasilla, has just become the latest. She is stepping down as a state senator after 14 years.</p> <p>Green is the leader of the Republicans in the Alaskan senate and an old-style fiscal conservative. She voted against several of the governor's most important initiatives over the past two years, including a move to increase taxes on the big oil and gas companies. Green was surprised by the reprisals that followed. \"I found early on that if you disagreed with her it was not taken as a disagreement with policy, but a personal disagreement.\"</p> <p>First came the embarrassment of a radio interview between Palin and a local rightwing shock-jock in which the interviewer called Green a bitch and a cancer within the party. Palin's response on air? She laughed.</p> <p>\"She knew I'm a cancer survivor - she sent me flowers,\" Green says. \"That was a very lacklustre moment.\"</p> <p>Then Palin arranged for a friend to stand this summer against Green in the Republican party's selection process for her own senate seat. Green decided to stand down rather than go through a primary battle she was sure would be ugly. \"There came a point when I thought it was no longer worth it,\" says Green. \"I didn't need, in a community as small as this, to stand in the face of this very popular governor.\" Then she adds: \"But it's not a way to run a government.\"</p> <p>That's a pertinent observation, I suggest, in the light of the next destination Sarah Palin hopes to reach in her improbable journey. \"It is pertinent,\" Green replies.</p> <h2>Putin v Palin: who would win in a shoot-out?</h2> <p>American politicians have a long tradition of talking up their expertise with firearms. Most recently, then-hopeful presidential candidate Mitt Romney was caught boasting he'd \"been a hunter pretty much all my life\" - by which, it turned out, he meant he'd been rabbit shooting twice. But Sarah Palin's claim seems far more justifiable: a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, she's been caribou hunting on numerous occasions, and footage exists of her firing an A4 assault rifle in Kuwait. She has also taken a close personal interest in \"aerial wolf gunning\", an Alaskan practice that involves exactly what you'd imagine.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin's recent tiger-tranquillising triumph, on the other hand, raises numerous questions. It wasn't caught on camera, even though he was with a TV crew, whose lives he reportedly saved, and footage that was released showed another member of the crew explaining how to hold the weapon. Firing a tranquilliser dart is easier, too: there's less kickback. Putin has been photographed brandishing a rifle in the past, but actual instances of shooting seem curiously absent.</p> <p>Gun enthusiasts swooned over Palin in the US, though some noted the rifle in the Kuwait video appears to be a modified one, equipped with a laser; you can't see the targets, but it's likely she was shooting at a simulator screen. Still, as one of the soldiers can be heard to observe, she's apparently \"hitting pretty close to dead centre\". </p> <p>This may not be the most persuasive foreign policy qualification in presidential history, but if Palin had to face Putin in a shoot-out on an ice floe in the Bering Strait, it seems likely she'd win. Unless Dick Cheney was hunting in the vicinity, of course, in which case he'd probably accidentally kill them both.</p>",
  "<p>The early morning sun was lighting up the clear blue sky that had just a hint of cloud, but a chilliness cooled its strength, and there was a smell of autumn in the air. A cockerel sounded out its early morning call, getting everyone into action. A red admiral butterfly tentatively came out of hiding in the shrubbery and went in search of nectar from the few spikes of buddleia still in bloom. Bees had been awakened too, buzzing from one flower to the next. Slow lumbering seagulls passed overhead, and a battalion of noisy rooks. A large family of long-tailed tits were whistling down the hedgerow, acrobatic with their long tails balancing them this way and that. Then a grey heron flew low overhead and I felt that I could reach up and grasp hold of its dangling legs. </p> <p>The swallows and house martins confirmed that it was a fine day, flying high on the thermals, but replacing the swifts that have left our shores now; there was a large flock of migrant fieldfares swirling above with a distinctive way of flapping their wings as they climb higher. As the day wore on the clouds were joining forces and having a battle with the sun: one minute it was bright sunshine, the next minute dull and dowdy. </p> <p>Later, I spotted a flock of rooks spiralling around and around, in a corkscrew formation, up and around, and around, which went on for quite a few minutes, and then suddenly they dispersed. I have heard that this sight is a sure sign of a storm to come, but as yet the storm hasn't happened, and for that the farmers will be thankful. It is the end of the day and getting dark early. I have watched the squadrons of seagulls and rooks make their return journey to their roosts, and now the night clouds are rolling in, switching off the last stains of salmon pink streaking the sky.</p>",
  "<p>Half an hour of tuneless singing and dedicated hammock swinging had finally lulled my son into his siesta. His big sister and father were in the hotel swimming pool and, aside from a local teenager offering rides on a scruffy old horse, there wasn't anybody else in sight. </p> <p>What to do with the temporary freedom? I sipped from a bottle of beer beside me and picked up a book I should have read years ago. It was enjoyable enough, but soon a darting movement caught my eye and I found myself looking at an iguana instead. </p> <p>We stared at each other for some time until he scampered away and I was left looking at an apparently empty Pacific beach. Then the sand began to move before my eyes. Crabs with stolen shells on their backs scuttled about their business, while their smaller less protected cousins pitted their speed against the reflexes of the birds padding about at the water's edge looking for lunch. Pelicans flew along the foaming breakers beyond searching out bigger prey, and a lone yellow butterfly headed off on some unknown mission towards the sun. </p> <p>The book stayed unread. People or no people, there was just too much world to watch going by on the beach.</p> <p>Troncones does not have the wondrous turquoise water and white sand of the Riviera Maya, or the adventure of the wilder parts of Mexico's coastline. The dilapidated glamour of corners of Acapulco is similarly absent, as is the party scene found at Puerto Vallarta. Still Troncones envelopes its visitors in natural beauty with such unfussy grace that, in my mind, it's as lovely as a Mexican beach resort gets.</p> <p>I am, I found out during our five days there this summer, in illustrious company in my assessment. Beaten to it, more like, by a coterie of international art world celebrities whose presence provides mere mortals with quite a fun game to play while walking along the beach - guessing which villa belongs to who.</p> <p>We are moderately confident we identified the home of artist and filmmaker Julian Schnabel while on our way to a natural tide pool surrounded by rocks and filled with bright blue tropical fish. It wasn't just the faultlessly tasteful house, and the faultlessly tasteful sand castle in front of it. There were also the orange hammocks slung gracefully below a palm leaf palapa - an open-sided thatched hut - decorated with similarly coloured glass buoys which, for me at least, conjured up images of Schnabel's film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.</p> <p>Rumour has it that Schnabel's good friend, Francis Ford Coppola, is currently scouting out a winter residence for himself. The Mexicans have their fair share of notables too, headlined by the foremost modernist painter and sculptor Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas. And the British are represented by none other than Damien Hirst, reputedly drawn to Troncones by his wife's enthusiasm for surfing.</p> <p>Surfers are among the most identifiable group of lesser known visitors too, attracted by a large number of \"left-turn point breaks\" that are reputedly both high quality and smooth, making them ideal for novices and veterans alike. All of which, I am reliably informed, holds particular appeal for those who favour a \"goofy foot stance\". </p> <p>This year, surfing tourism suffered somewhat following three shark attacks in March that left two surfers dead and a third requiring a thousand stitches. Freak events, say many who insist nothing like this has ever happened before in this area which first began to creep on to the alternative tourist map in the mid 1990s. </p> <p>It began with a handful of gringos buying up beach land and establishing the unwritten rule that all development would be low impact. At the time there was little more than a tiny village sandwiched between the ocean and a small, steep, jungle-covered mountain, home to fishermen and former construction workers turned subsistence farmers. Today there are about 250 rooms in small hotels along the three-mile-long beach costing between $50 and $250 a night. </p> <p>It is a shame that so few of them are Mexican owned. But at least the locals seem to have done significantly better out of tourism here than those swallowed up by the kind of mass resorts usually promoted by the Mexican authorities, resorts like Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, a 30-minute drive south.</p> <p>Most visitors to Troncones are foreigners too, most of them from the US and Canada escaping cold winters at home and arriving at the Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo airport a 45-minute cab drive away. But there are some Mexican tourists, many of them happy to drive the nine long hours from Mexico City, as we did.</p> <p>We stayed at a pleasant bed and breakfast called La Casa Delfin Sonriente - the Smiling Dolphin House. Not, I add, that we witnessed any of the aforementioned creatures said to frolic off the shore. It cost about US$70 a night for a family room with breakfast included, a pretty pool, and a cooler full of beer. All just steps from the beach through a garden filled with butterflies. </p> <p>It was perfect for us, though I could have done with a few less power ballads on the communal iPod. We could have done with a few less meals hastily prepared by me in the kitchen from the limited stocks in the local shops. It was far nicer when we got it together to walk up, or down, the beach to one of the restaurants serving fresh fish day and night. The best meal we had was at the Manzanillo Bay Inn where we got stuck one afternoon when a thunder storm scuppered our first attempt to play in the tide pool and we had walked on past the rocky point into the bay looking for shelter. Unfortunately the restaurant is tucked away from the hotel's spectacular views, but the seared tuna and ceviche were excellent. </p> <p>The Delfin Sonriente's owner, a friendly Californian surfer and one of the original Troncones pioneers, points out that the added value to the place doesn't stop at the waves, the celebrity spotting and the odd posh restaurant. There are also jungle hikes, caving, mountain biking, diving and bird watching. Not forgetting the more recent proliferation of yoga retreats, and the prevalence of massage tables on the sand's edge complete with ethereal white drapes fluttering in the breeze.</p> <p>None of these were really options for a family with small children, but contrary to my rather envious nature I did not find myself fantasising about them either. True the sun did pound down mercilessly most days, and we did run into a serious storm on the other. But for most of the time, being in the middle of the May-November low season meant we had the beach pretty much to ourselves, and that was priceless. Only as the sun set did a few more people emerge to play in the waves, the more confident taking on the undercurrents to go beyond the breakers and body surf back. At this time of year we also had a reasonable chance of seeing a turtle lumber up the sand to lay her eggs as night fell. We weren't that lucky but we were happy enough to watch the crabs scuttling about.</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>British Airways (08444 930 787, <a href=\"http://www.ba.com\">ba.com</a>) flies Heathrow-Mexico City then Mexico City-Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo with a local carrier from \u00a3937.30 rtn inc tax.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong></p> <p>La Casa del Delfin Sonriente (+55 5264 6582, <a href=\"http://www.casadelfinsonriente.com\">casadelfinsonriente.com</a>) bungalow rooms from $57 per night.</p> <p><strong>Further information</strong></p> <p>The Mexico Tourism Board: 020-7488 9392, <a href=\"http://www.visitmexico.com\">visitmexico.com</a>.<br>Country code: 0052.<br>Flight time: London-Mexico City 11\u00bchrs; Mexico City-Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo: 55mins.<br>\u00a31 = 16.78 pesos.</p>",
  "<p>'You're right to feel guilty. You know you shouldn't have done it. Bend over.\" This is a rough summary of the derivation of the immense power of the church and local traffic regulations. Let's just be thankful that traffic wardens don't also have a priestly function. </p> <p>The Guilty Party is the political wing of the Church. It works on the basis that everyone is guilty until proven innocent. This state arose through the so-called original sin, where Adam ate the apple from the tree of knowledge. These days, Adam would be congratulated on a significant contribution to his five portions of fruit and veg a day. </p> <p>Guilt is homesickness for a parallel universe where you are a much better person. It's a painful and persistent reminder that you could now be feeling virtuous if you hadn't consumed that tub of ice cream, the contents of the petty-cash tin or the body of your best friend's partner.</p> <p>The secret of living guilt-free is not to avoid doing anything bad, as the holiest of people are racked with guilt at the most trifling of sins. Instead, you should have no concept of good and bad, and just do whatever you please. Foxes don't feel guilty about chickens.</p> <p>One of the reasons court dramas are so popular is that they have a verdict at the end where someone is found innocent or guilty. In the real world, nothing is so clean-cut; things are naughty but nice, innocent but wicked, or bad but understandable. Only the last judgment will sort everything out, unless you feel your human rights have been breached. </p> <p>There are two kinds of guilt: the first is not doing what you've been told to do, which is bearable. The second is not doing what you personally know you should have done, which is not. Guilt is incredibly tenacious in the memory, possibly to stop you doing the same bad thing twice. The memory of pleasure is much weaker - unless, of course, it's a guilty pleasure.</p> <p>The guilt problem has given rise to the brilliant idea of a scapegoat, an entirely innocent party - normally a goat, or someone not present at a committee meeting - who takes the blame for the sins of the group. That's why you should never miss a committee meeting, and why goat's cheese tastes slightly odd.</p>",
  "<p>There can be few better ways of documenting modern life at genuinely grassroots level than the good old home video. And while we're often lamenting significant world issues, the local communities affected are often neglected, particularly in the film world. Northampton University's International Community Film Festival offers an antidote. The emphasis is on migration, asylum, ethnic diversity, and other community issues, albeit with a sly Hollywood injection - John Malkovich reads a poem in environmental film Polis Is This, while John Waters provides a voiceover for Plagues &amp; Pleasures On The Salton Sea. The opening night includes Crack, the first ever contribution from Syria, Children Need Playgrounds, in which kids interview the village grown-ups and Under The Same Roof, a Palestinian film that explores the often damaging consequences of walled communities.</p>",
  "<p>\"It takes a writer of considerable confidence, wit and skill to attempt a modern retelling of a bona fide English classic,\" said <strong>Melissa Katsoulis</strong> in the Times. \"And just a few chapters in to Peter Ackroyd's version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, with the sensations and ideas of Europe in the age of the Romantics fairly leaping off the page, you know as well as he does that this is the man for the job.\" \"The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein differs significantly from the novel to which it pays homage,\" observed <strong>Mich\u00e8le Roberts</strong> in the Independent. \"Ackroyd robs Mary Shelley of her authorship by making her a bit-player in Frankenstein's drama . . . Ackroyd's sleight of hand mimics that of Christian theology, whereby a male God, acting solo, animates humanity, disavowing the creative power of a woman's pregnancy.\" <strong>Michael Arditti</strong> in the Daily Telegraph called it \"a fiendishly clever literary conceit. As always in Ackroyd's novels, however fanciful the foreground, the background is meticulously researched, with fascinating incidental detail . . . The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein is a brilliant jeu d'esprit.\"</p> <p>Cameron on Cameron: Conversations with Dylan Jones \"offers a broad, shallow digest of Cameron's views, which stand almost entirely unchallenged\", wrote <strong>Deborah Orr</strong> in the Independent. \"Cameron claims that he wants to be as significant a social reformer as Thatcher was an economic reformer, but Jones displays even less understanding of just what a gargantuan undertaking this is than Cameron does.\" \"Since Jones seldom refers to any politician earlier than Margaret Thatcher, it is possible that he has never seen anyone like Cameron,\" said <strong>Andrew Gimson</strong> in the Daily Telegraph. \"He swallows without question Cameron's claim to be the candidate of change. But Harold Macmillan made much the same pitch . . . By the standards of our own time, Cameron may count as a moderniser, but at heart he is a traditional One Nation Tory . . . And how good Cameron's manners are - something he has in common with Tony Blair: Jones shows us a man who is almost alarmingly adept at revealing not one word more than he wishes.\" </p> <p>\"His book is as much about himself as it is about Mount Ararat,\" wrote <strong>John Morrish</strong> in the Independent on Sunday, reviewing Frank Westerman's Ararat: In Search of the Mythical Mountain. \"While he gives us a comprehensive account of the mountain's mythology and history, and tells the story of his determination to climb it, he also explores a more personal issue: that of his loss of religious faith.\" \"His journey . . . brings in the Armenian genocide, Atat\u00fcrk, the Kurdish insurgency and Orhan Pamuk,\" said <strong>Jeremy Seal</strong> in the Sunday Telegraph. \"Less excusable are a number of dull inclusions, not least an ongoing account of the bureaucracy entailed in securing a climbing visa, which only add to the impression of a book so swollen with uneven content as to burst its narrative banks.\" Nevertheless, <strong>Alexander Waugh</strong> in the Spectator called it \"a short book of stupendous richness and complexity . . . All this diverse material is held together by a thread of tension as to whether Westerman will find faith halfway up the mountain . . . The book (a fine translation from the Dutch by Sam Garrett) is unquestionably eccentric, but written with enough knowledge, craft and competence to keep the drowsiest of readers wide awake from first to last.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cabernet franc is an important variety famous for playing second fiddle to cabernet sauvignon, even though it can make some extremely </p> <p>fine wines in its own right (notably in France's St \u00c9milion, on Bordeaux's right bank, and in the middle Loire). What's more, DNA profiling has actually shown it to be a parent of cabernet sauvignon, along with the white grape sauvignon blanc.</p> <p>The vine looks much like cabernet sauvignon, except that the leaves are less indented. Cabernet franc buds and ripens earlier, which makes it more susceptible to coulure (where the grapes fail to develop), but it needs less heat to ripen fully. In left-bank Bordeaux, it is seen, with merlot, as a sort of insurance policy against a cool season.</p> <p>In very general terms, wine made from cabernet franc tends to be aromatically fruity, lighter and less tannic than cabernet sauvignon and, especially in the Loire, can smell appetisingly of pencil shavings. It is often rather herbaceous, and unripe cabernet sauvignon frequently smells like cabernet franc.</p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>Cabernet franc is an ingredient in most of the reds of south-west France, and often the sole inspiration for the fine, silky reds of the middle Loire, such as Saumur-Champigny, Bourgueil, Chinon and Anjou-Villages.</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Cabernet franc is widely grown in north-east Italy (where it is sometimes called cabernet frank or even bordo) and some Friuli examples are ripe enough to be thrilling. It is also grown over the border in Slovenia, although cabernet sauvignon is much more common in the rest of central Europe. In the new world, in most of which cabernet sauvignon can easily be ripened, cabernet franc is widely regarded as essential for respectability to make up the holy Bordeaux trio, with merlot. Varietal versions have emerged from Australia, South Africa and California to show just how appetising this variety can be unblended. It really shines in cooler regions such as Long Island in New York state, parts of Washington state and New Zealand.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Saumur Les Nivi\u00e8res 2006, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.99, Waitrose</strong></p> <p>This breezy standby has the invigorating smell of a particularly good summer pudding, dripping with the juice of raspberries, redcurrants and blueberries.

Strange choice for a child? Well, the song kept company with other children's vinyl such as He's Got the Whole World in his Hands and Polly Wolly Doodle ... so perhaps I was a strange child.</p> <p>Once I had wound up the gramophone, rested the shiny, black disc on the blue flock turntable, adjusted the speed lever and positioned the needle, the sound of I Dream of Jeanie hit the airwaves, and that was it.

He was an amateur footballer, capped four times for England during the 1950s and 60s, and was captain of Tooting and Mitcham 1st XI for many years. </p> <p>He was scouted by many of the top professional clubs at the time and was eventually signed up for Fulham (at the same time as Bobby Robson), but his dad told him he had to get a proper job and enrolled him at the Brixton School of Building where he qualified as a chartered surveyor.</p> <p>Despite having a regular job, Dad played an awful lot of football, going on many football tours around Europe, and of course every weekend. On a Saturday morning, Mum would usually be at the end of her tether and storm out of the house. We four children would then have to go with Dad to football, where we would hang around the sidelines annoying the linesman and screaming at Dad for ice-cream money (which he usually had jangling in his shorts). After the game, we'd sit in the clubhouse and be given Coke and baked-bean-flavoured crisps to keep us quiet until the players had had their communal bath before going home late in the evening.</p> <p>Despite the storming out, Mum and Dad were very happily married for 34 years before he died of cancer, aged 59.

But it should also be thinking ahead about how it can demonstrate a stronger commitment to security, democracy, and prosperity in the European \"neighborhood\". The most effective way of dealing with a newly-assertive Russia will be for Europe to issue a collective refusal to accept a bipolar Europe of distinct Russian and EU spheres of influence. </p> <p>The place to start is Ukraine. Fortunately, the EU-Ukraine summit on September 9 in Evian, France, provides the perfect opportunity. </p> <p>Many Ukrainians now hear domestic echoes of the lead-up to war in Georgia. Ukraine has its own potentially separatist region in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea\">Crimea</a>, and the country's Russian minority numbers some 8.3 million. Half of Ukraine's population is Russian-speaking in various degrees. Although the Ukrainian constitution bans dual citizenship, the government has had to launch an inquiry into alleged covert Russian passport-holding in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. Ukrainians note that Russia justified its invasion of Georgia, as the Nazis justified their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia\">dismemberment of Czechoslovakia</a>, as being necessary to \"protect\" a minority to whom they had just given citizenship. </p> <p>Russia has begun a war of words over Ukraine's supply of arms to Georgia. And the conflict itself has shown that the Russian Black Sea Fleet, based in Sevastopol, can operate with impunity, whether Ukraine likes it or not. </p> <p>Based on its analysis of Ukraine's \"<a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901041206-832153,00.html\">Orange Revolution</a>\" as a foreign-backed \"NGO revolution\", Russia has also been quietly building its own network of Russia-friendly NGOs in Ukraine since 2004. Ukrainians also talk of an <em>otkat ekonomiya</em> (\"kickback economy\"), in which Russian money percolates throughout the Ukrainian elite. </p> <p>The European Neighborhood Policy is worthy enough, but it does not address the pressing concerns about maintaining and securing Ukraine's independence. Many member states will worry about leaping straight to the contentious issue of ultimate membership for Ukraine, but the EU already recognises Ukraine's theoretical right to join once it has met the Copenhagen criteria; and it cannot be beyond EU leaders' verbal dexterity to play up the prospect. What Ukraine would value most is a real sense that it is being treated distinctly in its own right. The key words are \"association\" and \"partnership\", in whatever order or combination. </p> <p>The EU has more scope for short-term measures, and should develop a multi-dimensional solidarity strategy as a signal to both Ukraine and Russia. For example, the EU's foreign ministers should invite their Ukrainian counterpart to give a briefing on Ukraine-Russia relations at their next meeting. Ukraine should be offered a road map for visa-free travel. The new EU-Ukraine agreement should include a beefed-up solidarity clause, building on the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, whereby the EU would consult and assist Ukraine in case of challenges to its territorial integrity and sovereignty. And the EU should back Ukraine if it insists that the Russian Black Sea Fleet leaves on schedule in 2017. </p> <p>The EU should also launch a comprehensive study of all aspects of Europe's reliance on Russian energy supplies, including transit, energy security and conservation, supply diversification, and the impact of \"bypass\" pipelines like Nord Stream and South Stream. It should consider linking the opening of the Nord Stream pipeline, which would allow Russia to cut off gas to Poland and Ukraine while maintaining deliveries to Germany, to the opening of the proposed \"White Stream\" pipeline to bring gas from Azerbaijan directly to Ukraine via Georgia, bypassing Russia. </p> <p>The EU could even play a part in keeping the 2012 European Championship football finals on track. The decision to appoint Ukraine and Poland as co-hosts was a powerful symbol of European unity across the current EU border (Poland is a member, Ukraine is not). UEFA is unhappy with Ukraine's progress in building the necessary infrastructure, but Ukraine should be given time to get its act together. </p> <p>Where appropriate, the EU should extend these measures to Moldova, which is now calling Ukraine a \"strategic shelter.\" </p> <p>Ukraine faces a crucial presidential election in 2009 or 2010 (and Moldova will hold elections in March 2009). After getting its fingers badly burned at the last election in 2004, Russia is clearly tempted to intervene again. The \"Russian factor\" will strongly influence the campaign. Greater Western engagement is needed to ensure that the \"Europe factor\" is equally prominent. </p> <p><em>Andrew Wilson is a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. </em></p> <p><em>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>/European Council on Foreign Relations, 2008. </em></p>",
  "<p>\"In the end, we couldn't explain the huge difference between the John McCain of Thursday night and the one who ran such an angry and derisive campaign and convention \u2014 other than to conclude he has decided he can have it both ways. He can talk loftily of bipartisanship and allow his team to savage his opponent. What makes that so vexing \u2014 and so cynical \u2014 is that this is precisely how Mr Bush destroyed Mr McCain's candidacy in the 2000 primaries, with the help of the Karl Rovian team that now runs Mr McCain's campaign.\" <br><strong>\u2014 New York Times</strong></p> <p>\"Although he did not refrain from criticising Mr Obama \u2014 on taxes, jobs, education, trade, and health care \u2014 Mr McCain's approach was noticeably softer towards his opponent than Mr Obama's last week, when he portrayed the Arizona senator as someone so out of touch he 'simply doesn't get' the stresses felt by ordinary Americans. Much of Mr McCain's speech seemed a tacit rebuttal of that assertion as he described the trials of working Americans facing hard times.\" <br><strong>\u2014 Washington Post</strong></p> <p>\"In an inspirational acceptance speech, McCain accurately defined the breadth of the challenge. He used his own compelling personal story as a call to duty, and he emphasised his fighting spirit, both in war and in Washington. But McCain did not challenge Republican orthodoxy on any issue, and he did not define the hard choices that will have to be made to fix the nation's most intractable problems. That's nothing new for acceptance speeches, but the gap will have to be filled between now and election day.\" <br><strong>\u2014 USA Today</strong></p> <p>\"McCain deserves credit for infusing what could have been a purely rhetorical exercise with policy prescriptions. Yet this litany was notable also for what it omitted. Where was the robust defence of comprehensive immigration reform, perhaps the most dramatic example of McCain's ability to work with Democrats? Where was a specific blueprint for reform to prevent future collapses in the home mortgage market? It is \u2026 depressing, that a candidate who emphasises his role as a maverick would de-emphasise examples of his independence.\" <br><strong>\u2014 LA Times</strong></p>",
  "<p>I was born in a northern Canadian settlement so small it was accessible most of the year only by a Bombardier, a sort of huge military tank built for passengers. It was like a transport plane, a big iron bulb with caterpillar tracks. I swear we had a paddle-steamer for supplies in the summer. </p> <p>Take that, Sarah Palin. The place was six times smaller than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin2\">Wasilla, Alaska</a>, the town that birthed John McCain's strange vice-presidential \"soulmate\", as weird as that disconnected eerie smile that floats on his face as he stands next to her.</p> <p>My credentials are solid; Palin cannot out-hick me. Until I fled at 18, I never lived in a northern town of more than 12,000 people. My towns were full of Sarah Palins. These types are fine, such as they are, until they leave town and turn fraudulent. They label themselves \"the salt of the earth\". It's when they try to make that a qualification for a greater glory that things turn unpleasant.</p> <p>I never claimed a higher moral standing for coming from a great big empty on the map. Small towns are places that smart people escape from, for privacy, for variety, for intellect, for survival. Palin should have stayed home.</p> <p>Canada has lots of hockey moms. They're called Fran and Nancy. They have cruel haircuts and their voices shake the rafters of the rink as their rink-rats play. How can I translate the hearty, jollying-along Palin for British audiences? She's a working class <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/18/1\">Joan Hunter Dunn</a>. It's those volleyball shoulders and field-hockey thighs, the energy, the bullying, and the utter self-confidence in every lie she tells. </p> <p>Salt-of-the-earthers don't lie! But Palins do. I watched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/04/palin.analysis\">Palin last night</a>, my mouth open, my eyeballs drying out, my hand making shaky notes. I read them aghast. </p> <p>Did she really joke, \"You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull? Lipstick.\"?</p> <p>Did she just blow kisses to the audience? </p> <p>Did she just say, \"We need to produce more of our own oil and gas. Take it from a gal who knows the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_North_Slope\">North Slope</a>. We've got lots of both.\"?</p> <p>Yes, she did lie about billion-gallon slurps of oil and gas available for Americans to blow, about her support of Alaska's notorious pork-barrel \"<a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/Research/Budget/wm889.cfm\">bridge to nowhere</a>\", about which particular citizens will see tax increases under Obama (only the richest, and she knows that).</p> <p>She also lied when she slobbered over small-town folks (an American version of British farm life, except British farmers have a point). The granite honesty of hicks is a cliche, a fantasy, a meme of American life, as much as the working-class solidarity of Tony Blair was in 1997, and where did that get anyone?</p> <p>But most of all, she lied about the north and the virtues it supposedly confers on citizens. Canadians watch this with horror. To us, Alaska is the back of beyond. Americans feel the same way. Alaskans are a bunch of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Stevens\">Ted Stevens</a>, that enraged screaming old senator who explained that the internet was not a big truck, it was more like a \"bunch of tubes\". He was arrested and charged with taking bribes, but handily won the August senatorial primary.</p> <p>We love our own north to the point of covering our eyes and humming as it melts (yesterday the BBC headlined the collapse of Canada's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7595441.stm\">ice shelves</a>; Canadian papers and websites missed the story) but Alaska is different from our north. We share a 1,500-mile border with a frontier state full of drunks and crazy people, of the blight that cheap-built structures bring to a glorious landscape. Canadian firms invest billions in the place and mine its ores. One hundred thousand Canadians visit Alaska every year, and we like to pass by in cruise ships. But it never goes further than that. Alaska is our redneck cousin, our Yukon territory forms a blessed buffer zone, and thank God he never visits. Alaska is the end of the line.</p> <p>Palin got her first passport last year. (Americans didn't need a passport to enter Canada until recently). She seems to have visited us precisely once, not surprisingly since Alaskans regularly refer to the rest of the world as \"outside\". We are so foreign to her, this woman who might become US president.</p> <p>What is native to her is smugness, her certainty that what's good for Wasilla is good for the world in all its infinite variety. It's a variety that Palin will never begin to grasp.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/05/raceineducation.raceinschools\">Dr Steve Strand's report</a> is a timely reminder to government and schools of what black Caribbean parents and many black teachers have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/05/raceineducation.raceinschools1\">protesting about</a> for years. His research-based evidence has been preceded by the findings of black supplementary schools and the experience of frustrated parents up and down the land for decades, which is that teachers' low expectations and stereotypical beliefs regarding the ability of African Caribbean children and the quality of teaching that flows from them, are leading to educational underachievement, low student aspirations and an alienation from learning that encourages poor behaviour and discipline and low self worth. </p> <p>Forty years ago, the very first parliamentary select committee report on race relations and immigration charged that West Indian parents had overly high aspirations for their children and a tendency to equate length of time spent in school with the quality of schooling outcomes they could expect for their children. Little has changed since. Indeed, now that three generations of Caribbean heritage people have been through the British schooling system, teachers' professional socialisation with regard to teaching black Caribbean children has been largely influenced by expectations about challenging behaviour, unfocused learning, low aspirations and underachievement. Hardly surprising, therefore, that less than 50% of newly qualified teachers feel they have the competence and cultural awareness to deal with black students, especially in urban settings. The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p> <p>I had the experience while working as director of education in Hackney in the 1990s, of seeing my son losing his zest for learning and become utterly miserable at the very thought of another day at his local primary school. When I went to see the teacher whose teaching was, for him, a total turn-off, she said she saw him losing interest and talking with his friends more and more, but she \"just left him\". I took up the matter with the head teacher and was promptly accused of abusing my power as director of education and harassing the teacher. My son soon moved to another Hackney primary school, where he rediscovered his love of school and of learning. Many of his friends eventually transferred to secondary school ill-prepared both in terms of their attitude to learning and their self-management skills, neither of which had anything to do with their academic ability.</p> <p>The Communities Empowerment Network (<a href=\"http://www.compowernet.org/\">CEN</a>), of which I was chair for some years, represents black students and parents each week in disputes with schools about discriminatory practices around setting, banding and streaming. Black Caribbean students' experience of those arrangements often leads them to challenge teachers, stop applying themselves, indulge in disruptive behaviours or, where they can, drop a subject altogether.</p> <p>I suspect there are undisclosed issues to do with \"race\" and ability and how black Caribbean children learn, which account for the decisions that many teachers make, however much they might justify those decisions on grounds of pupil behaviour or lack of application. </p> <p>I recently produced <a href=\"www.jamaicateachers.org.jm/pdf/BlackYoungsters.pdf\">Born to be Great: a Charter on Raising the Attainment of Black Caribbean Boys (pdf)</a>, with the National Union of Teachers, based on a series of round-table discussions with black Caribbean students, parents and teachers. The charter is a bold affirmation that if we are to halt the destruction of hope and the death of aspiration, the descent into hopelessness that Strand's research heralds for far too many of our young people, all stakeholders must own up to their responsibilities and work individually and collectively to make a difference. That is why the charter articulates the entitlements and the responsibilities of students themselves, of their parents/carers and of schools and teachers. That is why it deserves to be adopted by the Department for Children, Schools and Families for use by schools and by black Caribbean students and parents.</p>",
  "<p>When gnarled former PoW John Sidney McCain III announced Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate, we were introduced to a new and instantly ubiquitous phrase - \"hockey mom\".</p> <p>Oh sure, those two words have probably been co-joined millions of times before. \"Can you drive me to hockey, mom?\" for instance. It's not like we're talking <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=%22shove-ha%27penny+daschund%22&amp;sp\">\"shove-ha'penny\" and \"daschund\"</a> here.</p> <p>But this was something new. This was a cold-bloodedly deliberate attempt at political branding. Palin referred to herself a hockey mom in her carefully scripted and vetted acceptance speech - and not for the first time. In 2004 she boasted: \"It's said the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick. So with lipstick on, the gloves come off.\"</p> <p>This is a deliberate political coinage. The question being, why? And how exactly does a hockey mom differ from a <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5DF1F31F933A15753C1A960958260\">soccer mom</a> (a phrase that's been around since at least 1983 but became a political clich\u00e9 during the 1996 presidential election when it was widely used to describe <a href=\"http://everything2.com/title/soccer%2520mom\">suburban white women who voted for Bill Clinton</a>).</p> <p>Philadelphia Weekly writer and hardcore soccerphobe Brian McManus thinks there is no difference. Soccer and hockey moms are the \"same exact thing, only she's from Alaska and they don't play soccer there. They play hockey.\" His colleague Dan McQuade agrees: \"It's too fucking cold to play soccer in Alaska.\"</p> <p>But extensive research - by which I mean <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=soccer+alaska&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=\">typing the words \"soccer\" and 'Alaska\" into Google</a> - revealed this assumption to be utter rubbish.</p> <p>So given that in Alaska soccer moms outnumber both the timber wolf and the caribou - what message was Palin trying to send by twisting the stereotype?</p> <p>\"A hockey mom is more American,\" says Philadelphia columnist Liz Spikol. \"A lot of Americans are suspicious of soccer, and still believe it connotes the foreign. Whereas hockey is as GOP-North American as a fetus on posterboard.\"</p> <p>She has a point. The soccer mom has mutated out of her political pigeonhole. In the lexicon of hipsters looking for an easy bourgeois icon to bash, the soccer mom has become an SUV-driving, road-hogging, sweatpants-wearing, latte-sipping, brat-spewing, strip mall-shopping, suburban folk devil.</p> <p>To others she's become lazy shorthand for white, middle-class heteronormativity. In the hit TV series Weeds the suburban drug dealer heroine is repeatedly referred to as a soccer mom - despite the fact that, when seen at her son's game in the first episode, she clearly believes that a match is comprised of four quarters.</p> <p>So why has the Republican candidate for vice-president worked so hard at branding herself with the hockey mom label? Of course it might simply be that she's genuinely immersed in ice-hockey culture. The thug who impregnated her 17-year-old daughter (and who <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5044198/field-guide-levi-johnston\">described himself as \"a fucking redneck\" on his MySpace page</a>) certainly is.</p> <p>\"I live to play hockey,\" he writes. 'Ya fuck with me I'll kick [your] ass'\"</p> <p>And there, I think - in a sweary nutshell - is the reason Palin is so keen to be seen as a hockey mom. In the minds of the effete conservative elite who run the Republican party, the hockey-playing yob who got Palin's daughter pregnant represents an idealised form of American masculinity - unthinking, brutish, willfully ignorant, easy to manipulate, unquestioningly patriotic, proudly reactionary, quick to respond to any perceived threat with overwhelming violence - and very unlikely to ever vote Democrat. Or - by extension - play soccer.</p> <p>For the weird truth is that while <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2199361/\">millions more Americans play and watch soccer than play and watch hockey</a>, millions of Americans stills see hockey as the more American sport.</p> <p>In the big cities - especially in California and the liberal north-east - soccer shirts now outnumber all other sports related streets wear gear (on non-match days, at least). In Philadelphia - a city that prides itself on its gritty, down-to-earth, parochial fan culture - a stroll around Center City on any Saturday afternoon shows evidence of the massive inroads cosmopolitan soccer culture has made into the American psyche. And it isn't just the shirts, or the soccer decals on every other car-arse. Soccer is everywhere in popular culture - the default choice whenever a movie or TV show needs a scene set at a sports event.</p> <p>But there remains a brutish, ignorant, xenophobic rump who regard soccer as effete, foreign and profoundly anti-American. And they are of course overwhelmingly attracted to the Republican party. For these die-hards soccer is emblematic of an imagined anti-American liberal (and, whisper it, Jewish) enemy-within out to undermine \"real\" American culture.</p> <p>And then there's the sport of ice hockey. Despite the fact that in both ice-hockey and soccer one of the most eagerly anticipated scenes is that of players slapping at each other ineffectually (ice hockey players because they're wearing pads and skates, the soccer players because all their muscles are in their legs and, besides, they've done nothing but play soccer since they were five and so never learned to fight properly), in the minds of what passes for the Republican intelligentsia, the two sports are worlds apart. Hockey is unpretentious, hardscrabble, working class and white. While soccer is French and gay.</p> <p>In the TV series Rescue Me - about unashamedly macho firefighters coming to terms with both post-9-11 trauma and their role in an increasingly feminised America, Dennis O'Leary and his super tough buddies are amateur ice hockey players. Of course they are. Had they been soccer players, at least a third of Americans would have been confused.</p> <p>Waidaminnit, what are they saying here? That 9-11 turned these guys gay?</p> <p>Of course, Palin misreads and underestimates both America and Americans; Republicans always do. On the train home from Philly today the three seats in front of me were filled with teenage field-hockey players - just part of the latest generation of women freed from spectating and cheerleading by America's awesome equality-of-sports-funding legislation, Title IX.</p> <p>There are conservative Americans who would no doubt find these confident, cocky, assertive teenagers un-womanly and uncouth (and some conservative readers of this blog too. I'm thinking particularly of the reader who described <a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/?inc=vid&amp;id=1110515\">Philadelphia's amazing female \"alleycat\" bike racers</a> as \"<a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/07/28/allgirl_alleycat_racing_could.html\">extremely unattractive, damaged, self-hating, aggressive femiNazis/lesbians</a>.\")</p> <p>But they're crazy and wrong. These women look empowered, relaxed, athletic and totally in control. And they're America's next crop of young female voters. Not soccer moms. Not hockey moms. But players.</p>",

Locals say it is the worst storm in living memory.</p> <p>But rather than freak out at the freak storm, many of the local people were excited by the event and even looked to divine intervention to explain it. \"We thought a big white sheet had been spread, so we decided to come and see for ourselves.

  "<p>A Hindu man is to ask the high court to overturn a ban on open-air cremations to allow the ancient religious ritual to take place in Britain. </p> <p>Davender Kumar Ghai, 69, is challenging Newcastle city council's decision to deny him an open-air cremation when he dies. In 2006 the local authority blocked his attempt to establish Britain's first approved site for burning bodies in the open, ruling it would breach cremation laws. </p> <p>Human rights lawyers will argue that open-air pyres fall outside the 1902 Cremation Act, which regulates what happens inside a crematorium, defined as \"any building fitted with appliances for the purpose of burning human remains\".</p> <p>The burning of a human body in the open air, they will say, is an offence only if it causes a public nuisance, which would be avoided because the sites would be in secluded locations. The hearing in November is expected to last three days.</p> <p>Indic religions allow open-air cremations, although these are not compulsory nor universal. </p> <p>Hinduism regards the body as an external garment that the individual inhabits. When this garment becomes worn out the individual moves on, taking a new birth and a new body. </p> <p>According to the 2001 census there were 558,342 Hindus in the UK although the figure is thought to be closer to 1 million, based on immigration levels. </p> <p>Andrew Singh Dogan, the legal coordinator of the multi-faith Anglo-Asian Friendship Society, said a positive outcome would primarily benefit Hindus, although people from all backgrounds could opt for an open-air cremation.</p> <p>\"An open-air pyre is \u00a3500 and a cheaper alternative to a traditional cremation, which costs at least \u00a32,000 and has you in and out in half an hour. An open-air pyre allows you to make it an all-day event, where you can eat, drink and cry and make it a family occasion.</p> <p>\"This ritual has been practised, virtually unchanged, in India for thousands of years. We've had many letters of support from individuals and organisations. Mr Ghai is a devout Hindu who wishes to be cremated according to Hindu scripture.\"</p> <p>Ghai, who is the head of the friendship society, was responsible for the first human funeral pyre in Britain since 1934, when the Home Office authorised the outdoor cremation of Sumshere Jung, a Nepalese princess and the wife of the Nepalese ambassador.</p> <p>Ghai also arranged for the body of Rajpal Mehat, a 31-year-old Indian illegal immigrant found drowned in a London canal, to be burnt on a wooden pyre at a secret location in Northumberland in 2006.</p> <p>Newcastle council deemed the ceremony illegal and a police file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. It ruled that an offence had been committed, but said prosecution would not be in the public interest.</p> <p>Jay Lakhani, of the Hindu Academy, described open-air cremation as an \"antiquated practice\".</p> <p>\"Modern India is growing up and in tiny villages where they don't have facilities they have these pyres. In Britain we are very lucky to have hygienic crematoriums. The ceremonial aspects should evolve to reflect the changes in society.\"</p> <p>A spokesman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs refused to comment on the environmental impact of open-air cremations, saying the matter was subject to a judicial review.</p>",
  "<p>1) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JLXq75SArY\">Argentina 0-5 Colombia</a>, Buenos Aires, September 5 1993</strong></p> <p>The age-old, yet increasingly ignored, maxim that a successful team does not necessarily comprise the best players has never been better exemplified than in Colombia's demolition of Argentina, which changed the life of so many and ultimately curtailed the life of Andr\u00e9s Escobar. Faustino Asprilla and Carlos Valderrama were the only true stars of the side, but the key to the overall excellence was their almost telepathic understanding with Freddy Rinc\u00f3n, Adolfo Valencia and the water-carriers, Leonel \u00c1lvarez and Gabriel Gomez. Watching them fizz the sphere around at pace was like seeing Sensible Soccer come to life.</p> <p>Take the first goal: Valderrama's brilliant pass opens up the defence, with the sudden and devastating effect of someone whisking away another man's towel in a locker-room, allowing the marauding Rinc\u00f3n to score. Once Asprilla had teased Diego Simeone to score the second, Colombia were able to sit in and simply shred Argentina with some don't-blink-and-you'll-still-probably-miss-it counter-attacks. Asprilla's preposterously good chip for the fourth goal sticks in the memory, but the other two were also beautiful in their conception.</p> <p>Some will say this particular Argentina team was relatively poor - names like Julio C\u00e9sar Saldana, Miguel Zapata and Ram\u00f3n Medina Bello would not enter pantheon - but defeats like this just do not happen to the big boys on their own patch. It was like seeing Vic Mackey get duffed up on the streets of Farmington. And besides, as Colombia had showed, you didn't need stars to be a great team.</p> <p>2) <strong>Poland 0-0 England, Katowice, October 11 1989</strong></p> <p>Everybody remembers England's Italia 90 campaign - Gazza's tears, Chris Waddle looking about as comfortable as a priest at an orgy while doing that absurd dance with Terry Butcher, the last great England kit, and so on - and how it changed football in this country forever. What few remember, possibly because they didn't know what football was at that point, is how close England came to not even qualifying. Even though they had not conceded a single goal in the campaign, England needed a draw in Poland to clinch a place through a complicated system in which some second-placed sides got through and others didn't. But after 1973, the thought of needing a result against Poland turned the heebie-jeebieometer up to 10, and as an attacking unit England didn't turn up in Katowice.</p> <p>One man turned up, and then set up camp: Peter Shilton. For 90 minutes he was like a man boinging between two adjacent trampolines, leaping left and right to repel some of the most incessant, vicious and accurate long-range shooting ever seen in a single match. Finally, in the very last minute, he was beaten, but Ryszard Tarasiewicz's dipping howitzer thwanged off the crossbar (Shilton, with a straight face, said he pulled his hand away because he didn't want to concede a corner). Had it gone an inch lower, you might not even be reading this.</p> <p>3) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txn6AZnnqhI&amp;feature=related\">Denmark 4-2 USSR</a>, Copenhagen, May 6 1985</strong></p> <p>World Cup qualifiers have so much at stake that, by their very nature, they are invariably more memorable for the tension than the quality of play. This contest, between two sides who would briefly dazzle at Mexico 86, was a significant exception: it was a game of the very highest technical quality. The tempo is frightening even by today's standards, never mind those of 23 years ago.</p> <p>The goals weren't bad either. Preben Elkjaer's second, after he was left alone against four defenders, is a regal combination of skill, strength and swagger; Michael Laudrup's pair could barely have been more contrasting, the languid insouciance of the first followed by a thrillingly direct run from the halfway line for the second; and Oleg Protasov's angry screamer, to bring the USSR back into the game at 2-1, would have been the goal of the game most of the time. It was a sign of things to come: there would be 33 goals in the two sides' eight games at the World Cup a year later.</p> <p>4) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFfQ8ciXrMk&amp;feature=related\">Wales 1-1 Scotland</a>, Cardiff, September 10 1985</strong></p> <p>Scotland's World Cup failures usually have a whiff of the tragicomic, but here their success was entirely overshadowed by tragedy when, towards the end of this pivotal match, their manager Jock Stein suffered a fatal heart attack.</p> <p>The stakes seemed high enough at the start of the game. Wales needed a win to reach a qualification play-off against Australia; Scotland needed a draw. Wales led through a superb goal from Mark Hughes at half-time - when, on an unbelievably manic night, Scotland's Jim Leighton had to be taken off <em>because he'd lost a contact lens and hadn't brought any spares</em> - but a dodgy late penalty, converted nervelessly by Davie Cooper, put Scotland through.</p> <p>Not that it counted for anything half an hour later. Stein's assistant Alex Ferguson had to phone Stein's family with the tragic news, a task so far beyond anything you'd find in the Big Book of Management that it boggles the mind. For all the Scottish fans, triumph had never felt so <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8csbWXt__E\">disastrous</a>.</p> <p>5) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BNkO9l318o\">Germany 1-5 England</a>, Munich, September 1 2001</strong></p> <p>Football was a simple game on September 1 2001: 22 men kicked a ball around, and at the end the Germans suffered an unparalleled humiliation. But while they soon put the result to bed like the professionals they are, England couldn't. Indeed English football's most celebrated result since 1966 might have been the worst thing that could have happened. For a start, it ended up creating unreasonable expectations of Sven-Goran Eriksson, who was abused upon leaving the job despite taking England to three consecutive quarter-finals for the first time, one of them with Danny Mills.</p> <p>It also kick-started a process whereby a nascent golden generation - only David Seaman had more than 40 caps here - became an abhorrent bling generation. And worst of all, it helped create Tool Britannia, a cultural revolution in which hundreds of thousands of people would be unable to comprehend why a team blessed with technically superior players could beat Goldenballs, Stevie G, Lamps, Rio, Mickey Blue Eyes and Frankie Knuckles, or whoever else makes up the team.</p> <p>Still, for 90 minutes it was fun. And the schadenfreude has never tasted so good before.</p> <p>6) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXMwnoAp4kc&amp;feature=related\">Scotland 1-1 Germany</a>, Glasgow, April 16 1969</strong></p> <p>These days you can qualify for the World Cup by doing little more than spelling your name correctly. But back in the day, especially when it was a 16-team tournament, the qualification process provided a serious examination. For Mexico 1970, only one of a great West German side and a very good Scotland side could qualify. The final group table (West Germany 11 points from six games, Scotland 7) suggests a comfortable campaign for West Germany. Far from it. Had Scotland won their penultimate game, in Germany, they would have gone through, and might ultimately have done so with a draw: they lost 3-2, but only to a goal in the last 10 minutes, having led early on through the marvellous Jimmy Johnstone and then equalised through Alan Gilzean just after the hour.</p> <p>We're including the first game between the sides here, mainly because it's on YouTube and the 3-2 isn't, but it was also a bona fide cracker. Towards the end of a see-saw first half, Gerd M\u00fcller typically Abra Kadabrad a goal from a nothing situation before setting off on his inimitable star-jump/air-punch celebration, a gesture <em>so</em> uncool that - mainly because it was M\u00fcller - it became exquisitely cool. But as the second half went on Scotland pummeled the Germans. They might have had more than one penalty (it's interesting to note a German defender gesturing to signal a dive by Denis Law), but eventually equalised with five minutes to go when Bobby Murdoch drove forward from midfield, played a one-two with Charlie Cooke and scorched one into the top corner. The two sides were to be separated in the end, but Scotland emerged from it all with enormous honour.</p>",
  "<p>Neither the man from the Metropolitan police nor London's mayor could be accused of presentation fatigue. At a joint press conference at City Hall on Wednesday, Boris Johnson and Sir Paul Stephenson hawked Scotland Yard's new, London-wide <a href=\"http://maps.met.police.uk/\">crime mapping website</a> with the uncrushable optimism and huckster guile of door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesmen. Is law-breaking soiling the deep pile of your neighbourhood? We have the answer! <a href=\"http://homepage.ntlworld.com/paul.linnell/sso/hoover/hoover541ad.jpg\">It beats as it sweeps as it cleans!</a></p> <p>That sounds too cynical, and is. Oh, doubts are justified. Johnson likes crime maps because they were part of Rudi Giuliani's \"<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12481097/\">miracle</a>\", but the right never addresses why the miracle happened <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4039259.ece\">everywhere else too</a>. The Met's site is, in any case, not the same or as the CompStat system used in New York. Add the usual data debates about changing categorisations, under-reporting (especially in poor areas) and concentrated police action making the stats look worse rather than the problem appear addressed, and you've good reason for wondering if the \u00a3210,000 it cost to set the system up has been well spent. </p> <p>Against all that, though \u2013 and here's where the pitch was smart \u2013 the emphasis was all on enhancing police accountability and public confidence. Never mind, we were told, that including data about clear-up rates is only being \"considered\" or that the stories it tells about each ward \u2013 \"sub-ward\", even \u2013 of the capital might differ sharply from the one told on the ground, the point was that the maps would encourage \"a more detailed conversation\" with people, Stephenson said. Johnson stressed that he wanted Londoners to see and therefore believe that when they become a victim of an offence, it does not go unnoticed.</p> <p>Well, fair enough. These are desirable goals and good luck with pursuing them, gentlemen. I just hope you're never accused of overselling. Crime-busting initiatives, especially when a groovy bit of high-tech kit is involved, raise expectations that seem doomed never to be satisfied. Johnson profited in the mayoral election campaign by siding with public scepticism about every official claim that crime is down. In a climate of horror about teenage knife attacks in particular, Ken Livingstone's cold numbers cut little ice with London's electors compared with Johnson's warm promises to listen to their anxieties and act. But will his actions produce results? </p> <p>It's an indictment of 10 years of Labour in government that a sometime figure of fun like Johnson now intones a version of the crime-and-its-causes mantra more convincingly than the party whose former leader invented it. Has there been a sadder feature of all those years in power than the risible \"tough\" posturing of successive Labour home secretaries or Tony Blair's Dirty Harry strutting at the dispatch box during his final months? As Labour has degenerated into craven tabloid-pleasing, Tories often <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20080120/ai_n21207413\">look enlightened</a> by comparison.</p> <p>Johnson has a chance to translate appearances into reality. It's early days and so no surprise that he's offered mostly gestures so far: the public transport booze ban might not be enforceable; he may be sort of right that every knife seized under <a href=\"http://cms.met.police.uk/news/major_operational_announcements/more_than_500_knives_seized_in_blunt_ii\">Operation Blunt 2</a> represents a potential life saved, but there's always another blade in the kitchen drawer. The true tests are yet to come, and public opinion \u2013 unreasonable, irrational and driven by fright \u2013 will set the hardest of them. </p> <p>I returned from my summer travels to learn that two more teenagers had died within walking distance of my east London home. One fell while trying to climb down the side of the block of flats where he lived, apparently <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7574210.stm\">fearing</a> that a group of youths was coming to kill him. The other, just 14 years old, was stabbed after being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/02/knifecrime.ukcrime\">attacked</a> by a gang within yards of his front door. The rate of teen murders in London this year is close to one a week. Sooner or later, citizens will start asking why Johnson hasn't brought it down.</p> <p>The question won't be fair. Unlike other crimes, the incidence of murder is not difficult to measure \u2013 it's hard to miscount corpses \u2013 but its causes and the secrets of its prevention are as complex and varied as with any other kind of offence. No London mayor \u2013 no politician \u2013 can solve all of these and any deep and substantial difference he makes will not be easy to quantify, let alone claim credit for \u2013 especially when he got elected rubbishing Met figures. Moreover, Johnson's powers to tackle the entrenched inequalities that help to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/ukcrime.economicgrowth\">nurture barbarous tendencies</a> are limited. </p> <p>What he has, though, is energy and big promises to keep. His policies for combating youth disaffection \u2013 the \"causes\" side of the Blairite equation \u2013 will be unveiled in the coming months and may surprise us with their scope. It will be ironic and, to a degree, deserved if his exploitation of the crime issue becomes a rod for his own back, and the cynicism I felt at the crime-mapping launch won't go away. But Johnson is making braver and wiser noises about crime than any other politician at this time. For that alone, let's wish him well.</p> <p><strong>Read Dave Hill's brand new London Blog <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog\">here</a>.</strong></p>",

  "<p>The anticipation of spending a night in a hotel has been sweetened by the hairshirt of a week's camping in \"monsoon England\". As we travel towards the Devonshire coast thoughts of a real bed and drinking tea out of china mugs are getting stronger by the mile. The flowing dual-carriageway narrows to a winding B road then peters out into a meandering lane that criss-crosses the river Dart, passing sleepy cream-tea villages and a pleasing amount of cider presses. Finally, the coast comes into spectacular view at Kingsbridge, where the boats list drunkenly on the marbled mud flats of the estuary. </p> <p>Just a couple of miles more and we arrive at the appropriately sleepy Chillington. There is not much of it to get lost in, yet it takes us a couple of drives through before we finally spot the Whitehouse. Is that it? It looks like more of an off-white cottage. But wait a minute - as we turn down the leafy side road, a handsome Georgian (and indeed white) house stretches back from the road and looks out on to a pretty terrace and sweeping lawn. Tasteful sculptures and swing seats stand among the foliage. It all looks glorious in the early afternoon sunshine. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337306405\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/04/Studyi.jpg\" alt=\"Whitehouse, Devon: study\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The study</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In true country spirit the front door is open so we let ourselves in and make our way round to the reception, which doubles as a bar. I like the logic behind this \u2013 what could be more welcoming to a thirsty traveller? Owner Tamara welcomes us and within minutes is inviting us to put up our feet up in the study or sitting room for a tea break - it's a policy of the hotel to offer all guests a free cream tea at 4pm. Both rooms have fat leather easy chairs and sofas, and roaring log fires - surprisingly welcome on this autumnal \"summer's\" day. </p> <p>We opt for the lounge and sink into one of the sofas, which are arranged in sociable clusters around the room. Mini, the resident lurcher, dozes by the fire and a couple of Siamese cats pad in to see who the newcomers are. First impressions are that a lot of thought has gone into making the Whitehouse feel like our house for the weekend rather than a hotel. Over tea Tamara explains how she met business partners Matt and Ally as a mature student at university in 2002 and the Whitehouse is the final realisation of their dream to create a hotel based on the things that they all enjoy \u2013 big beds, big baths and unhurried simple food.</p> <p>The cream tea is worthy of its Devonshire tag and feeling revived, we head upstairs to freshen up before venturing out to explore. The room is everything a weary camper could have dreamt of. An enormous bed takes pride of place, spread with white Frette linen (\"I could pitch our entire tent on that,\" says my partner). A velvet purple sofa-for-two faces a 24\" plasma screen TV and iPod dock - its splash of colour adds a kitsch twist to the restful grey of the walls and natural oak floorboards. The mini bar has been stylishly reworked as an oak-covered ice-box with a tempting menu of organic and local teas and snacks. My caffeine-addict's gaze spies the Nespresso coffee machine, like a magpie finding silver.</p> <p>The bathroom is equally luxurious: there's a free-standing bath in the centre of the room next to a big rain shower. A rocking chair sits by the window and piled with thick fluffy towels. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337306220\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/04/Exteriori.jpg\" alt=\"Whitehouse, Devon: exterior\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Whitehouse exterior</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back on the \"main\" street to the village we decide to take a trip to the sea. The one drawback of Whitehouse is the lack of sea view for a place so tantalisingly close to spectacular swimming beaches and unspoilt coast. But then it is only a two-mile stroll to Slapton bay to get your coastal fix, past rose-fronted thatched cottages cuddled together on lanes that were clearly designed long before the motorcar. The local pub is calling, but dinner in the hotel conservatory tempts us back.</p> <p>Being by the sea we opt for a starter of local Start Bay crab to share \u2013 a hands-on dish so not one for a first date, but super tasty. For main course I choose roasted fillet of sea bass with sauce vierge, new potatoes and spring vegetables while my partner opts for sirloin steak with black pepper and chive butter. For pudding we can't decide between rich chocolate mousse cake with poached plum and the cheese board so cheat and have both to share. The food is hearty and delicious with ingredients sourced from local suppliers \u2013 so the menu changes according to what's available. </p> <p>For pre-holiday season, the restaurant is fairly busy. \"We wanted the White house to fit in with the local community as well as providing a place for tourists to stay,\" explains Tamara. Non-guests can come for dinner or informal Sunday brunch, or for barbecue days in the garden. They also hold film nights where groups of friends can hire out the meeting room and snack on popcorn and home-baked muffins. </p> <p>It's an ethos that seems in keeping with the whole feel of the place \u2013 the ultra-chic design softened by individual pieces like an antique writing table, furnishing that don't sacrifice comfort for style, and carefully placed books, a huge chest of dvds and games all invite you to settle in and make yourself at home. </p> <p>The next morning the rare appearance of the sun lures us off in search of a sea swim rather than making use of the free guests' membership to the Dart Marina Spa.

  "<p>Republican convention goers last night said nominee John McCain's speech, which relied heavily on images from his military service and captivity in Vietnam, introduced him to an American public still unfamiliar with his narrative.</p> <p>In interviews after the balloons and confetti fell to the floor of the Xcel Centre and the thunderous applause quieted, Republican party activists and officials said the speech rallied the party around a candidate of whom many were initially sceptical.</p> <p>\"He was there tonight to make people see the true man that he really is,\" said Ray Ouelette of Rhode Island. \"A man who works with honour, has achieved honour, and who is bringing honour to this presidency that need to be recharged with honour.\"</p> <p>Republicans in the hall for the 50-minute speech said McCain appropriately and gently criticised Democratic nominee Barack Obama without making him the focus of the address.</p> <p>\"He laid it out very clear that you either have a liberal big-government, free-spending Barack Obama,\" said JT Waggoner, leader of the Republican party in the Alabama state senate, \"or you have a tax-cutting, smaller-government John McCain.\"</p> <p>Wendell Moore of Tennessee said it is not John McCain's style to launch fusillades at political opponents.</p> <p>\"Other people, like the Rudy Giulianis of the world, the Fred Thompsons, that was their job,\" Moore said, referring to McCain's erstwhile rivals who addressed the convention earlier this week. </p> <p>\"He did make some distinctions on some critical issues where they're different. That's what we will continue to see him do.\"</p> <p>In the speech McCain did not lay out many specific policy details, but party delegates and other Republicans said those will come down within the next two months of the race.</p> <p>\"What he did was try to restore some pride,\" said Roger Romine, a state legislator from West Virginia. \"He didn't have time to get into specifics. I'm sure he'll get into that on the campaign trail but tonight was just to let the people know where he stood, his vision for America, and where we are going, not necessarily how we're going to get there.\"</p> <p>But not all party activists were thrilled. A contingent of supporters of Ron Paul, a Libetarian congressman who launched an insurgent challenge to McCain and other more established candidates, said the speech did not gibe with McCain's record, for instance his support for a more liberal immigration programme.</p> <p>Stephen Hardy, a delegate from Washington state, also disliked the martial rhetoric.</p> <p>\"I don't think we need to have an aggressive foreign policy,\" he said. \"I don't think we need this pre-emptive war. I saw signs that said 'peace through strength.' That's not what it's about. It's about peace through freedom, and minding our liberties.\"</p> <p>Phyllis Haggard of Michigan said the speech energised party activists, who must now spend the next two months rallying voters behind McCain.</p> <p>\"Overall, his dedication to his country, what he's given, his experience, I think his true caring for the American people came out very clearly,\" she said. \"Campaigning is hard work. When we get back they'll be all set to go to work.\"<br></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337321609\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>John McCain wrapped up the Republican convention tonight by reaching out beyond the party faithful to the independents who will determine in November whether he or Barack Obama is the next occupant of the White House.</p> <p>After formally accepting the Republican presidential nomination, he used his prime-time speech to try to steal from his Democratic rival the theme of change, a potent message in an election year in which voters are disillusioned with the George Bush presidency, the Iraq war and the state of the economy.</p> <p>\"Let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming,\" he said.</p> <p>Warming to his theme of shaking up Washington, McCain appeared to borrow a phrase from the British prime minister John Major's last years in power saying he would take the Republican \"back to basics\".</p> <p>Touching on another theme popular with independents, he promised to end the \"constant partisan rancour\" that has left Washington so often deadlocked.</p> <p>McCain, the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line, was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end, as confetti and 200,000 balloons floated from the ceiling, the traditional convention finish.</p> <p>But, a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past, he failed to match either the rhetoric of Obama in Denver last week or even the feisty, sarcastic delivery of his own running mate, Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Some of the loudest cheers of the night were when Palin, the new darling of the Republican party, joined him at the end.</p> <p>Although the organisers said the theme of the day was \"peace,\" the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic. McCain devoted a large part of his speech to one of his biggest selling points, the period that turned him into an American hero, his five years in a Hanoi jail after his plane crashed on a bombing mission. As an admiral's son, he was offered the chance of early release but turned it down, refusing preferential treatment.</p> <p>The passage on his prison years, which seldom fails to resonate with Americans, earned him four standing ovations, to chants of \"USA, USA\".</p> <p>His time in jail, he said, turned him into a super-patriot. \"I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's \u2026 I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's.\" </p> <p>The speech was a high point for McCain, aged 72, who was watched by his mother, Roberta, aged 96, and comes a year after he almost had to pull out of the Republican nomination with his campaign close to bankruptcy.</p> <p>McCain, ignoring the sustained personal - and frequently misleading - attacks on Obama at the convention, chose to present himself as above such tactics, saying he admired his Democratic rival for his achievement in winning his party's nomination. \"Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us,\" he said, to applause. \"We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other.\"</p> <p>McCain, aware of his limitations as a speaker, attempted to recreate the intimacy of the townhall meetings with which he is more comfortable by placing the podium in the middle of the audience, but it was a failed experiment, with his delivery as deadening as ever.</p> <p>The start of his speech was briefly marred by protesters, including one from military veterans opposed to him. </p> <p>He used the convention to try to win over the millions watching at home with his promise of a bipartisan approach to politics, saying he had a proven record of working with Democrats in the Senate, often in the face of anger from fellow Republicans. \"I have the record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not,\" McCain said.</p> <p>He is friends with many Democratic senators and has sponsored various bipartisan initiatives in the Senate, including a bill to ease illegal immigration along with the Democrat Ted Kennedy, angering Republicans.</p> <p>Forseeing a McCain presidency he said: \"I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability.\"</p> <p>But pointing to other differences with the Democratic nominee, he said there was a gap between them on tax cuts, foreign policy - particularly Iraq - and drilling for oil in US waters. </p> <p>He issued a warning to Russia over the conflict in Georgia. \"We can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people,\" he said.</p> <p>One of the loudest ovations he received all night was when he spoke about Palin. \"I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming,\" McCain said.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337321609\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Thank you all very much. Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans - the privilege of accepting our party's nomination for president of the United States. And I accept it with gratitude, humility and confidence. </p> <p>In my life, no success has come without a good fight, and this nomination wasn't any different. That's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. They're leaders of great ability, who love our country, and wished to lead it to better days. Their support is an honour I won't forget. </p> <p>I'm grateful to the president for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable; and to the first lady, Laura Bush, a model of grace and kindness in public and in private. And I'm grateful to the 41st president and his bride of 63 years, and for their outstanding example of honourable service to our country. </p> <p>As always, I'm indebted to my wife, Cindy, and my seven children. The pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation's business. But I have treasured them all the more, and can't imagine a life without the happiness you give me. Cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight. But, in truth, she's more my inspiration than I am hers. Her concern for those less blessed than we are - victims of landmines, children born in poverty and with birth defects - shows the measure of her humanity. I know she will make a great first lady. </p> <p>When I was growing up, my father was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and me would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of life, her deep interest in the world, her strength and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country. I wouldn't be here tonight but for the strength of her character. </p> <p>My heartfelt thanks to all of you, who helped me win this nomination, and stood by me when the odds were long. I won't let you down. To Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust. I intend to earn it. </p> <p>Finally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration. Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other. We're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. No country ever had a greater cause than that. And I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honour Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement. </p> <p>But let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election. And after we've won, we're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government start working for you again, and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace. </p> <p>These are tough times for many of you. You're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home. All you ever asked of government is to stand on your side, not in your way. And that's just what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for your future. </p> <p>And I've found just the right partner to help me shake up Washington, governor Sarah Palin of Alaska. She has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment. She's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption. She's balanced a budget, cut taxes and taken on the special interests. She's reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, Democrats and Independents to serve in her administration. She's the mother of five children. She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and healthcare and the cost of gasoline and groceries. </p> <p>She knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down. I'm very proud to have introduced our next vice-president to the country. But I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming. </p> <p>I'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is Governor Palin. And when we tell you we're going to change Washington, and stop leaving our country's problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count on it. We've got a record of doing just that, and the strength, experience, judgment and backbone to keep our word to you. </p> <p>You know, I've been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes it's meant as a compliment and sometimes it's not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you. </p> <p>I've fought corruption, and it didn't matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They violated their public trust, and had to be held accountable. I've fought big spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither need nor want, while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment. I've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections. I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes. I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses. </p> <p>I fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn't a popular thing to do. And when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war. </p> <p>Thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general, David Petraeus, and the brave men and women he has the honour to command, that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralised our military, risked a wider war and threatened the security of all Americans. </p> <p>I don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life. But I learned an important lesson along the way. In the end, it matters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test. </p> <p>I fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real-estate investments in the bad housing market. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills. </p> <p>I fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake works on a loading dock; coaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her master's degree. They have two sons, the youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. Their lives should matter to the people they elect to office. They matter to me. </p> <p>I fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfboro, New Hampshire, who died serving our country in Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to honour their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to, remains safe from its enemies. </p> <p>I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost their trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it bigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties and Senator Obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their trust, when we valued our power over our principles. </p> <p>We're going to change that. We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics. </p> <p>We believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans. </p> <p>We believe in low taxes; spending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor. </p> <p>We believe in a strong defense, work, faith, service, a culture of life, personal responsibility, the rule of law and judges who dispense justice impartially and don't legislate from the bench. We believe in the values of families, neighborhoods and communities. </p> <p>We believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans. Government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself. </p> <p>I will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it. </p> <p>My tax cuts will create jobs. His tax increases will eliminate them. My healthcare plan will make it easier for more Americans to find and keep good healthcare insurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages and force families into a government-run healthcare system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor. </p> <p>Keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second-highest business tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas. Doubling the child tax exemption from $3500 to $7000 will improve the lives of millions of American families. Reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save, spend and invest as you see fit. Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity. </p> <p>I know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed. Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away. </p> <p>We will prepare them for the jobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries that have been hard hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage. </p> <p>Education is the civil rights issue of this century. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school? We need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents with choice, remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and reward good teachers and help bad teachers find another line of work. </p> <p>When a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children. And I intend to give it to them. Some may choose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will choose a charter school. But they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity. </p> <p>Senator Obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies. I want schools to answer to parents and students. And when I'm president, they will. </p> <p>My fellow Americans, when I'm president, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades. We are going to stop sending $700bn a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now. We will build more nuclear power plants. We will develop clean coal technology. We will increase the use of wind, tide, solar and natural gas. We will encourage the development and use of flex fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles. </p> <p>Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power. But Americans know better than that. We must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet. It's an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by nature, and we have faced greater challenges. It's time for us to show the world again how Americans lead. </p> <p>This great national cause will create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity; jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce. </p> <p>Today, the prospect of a better world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them, as Americans before us did, with confidence, wisdom and resolve. </p> <p>We have dealt a serious blow to al-Qaida in recent years. But they are not defeated, and they'll strike us again if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia's leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world's oil supply, intimidate other neighbours, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of Georgia need our solidarity and prayers. As president, I will work to establish good relations with Russia so we need not fear a return of the cold war. But we can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people. </p> <p>We face many threats in this dangerous world, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm prepared for them. I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better and what it should not do. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. I know how to secure the peace. </p> <p>When I was five years old, a car pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination. </p> <p>I'm running for president to keep the country I love safe, and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic, economic, military and the power of our ideals - to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace. </p> <p>In America, we change things that need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our greatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it. </p> <p>We need to change the way government does almost everything: from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children. All these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy, the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do business in Washington. </p> <p>The constant partisan rancour that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause, it's a symptom. It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you. </p> <p>Again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as president. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not. </p> <p>Instead of rejecting good ideas because we didn't think of them first, let's use the best ideas from both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let's try sharing it. This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability. </p> <p>We're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won't care who gets the credit. </p> <p>I've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. But I have been her servant first, last and always. And I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank God for the privilege. </p> <p>Long ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes, and I witnessed a thousand acts of courage, compassion and love. </p> <p>On an October morning, in the Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I hadn't any worry I wouldn't come back safe and sound. I thought I was tougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too. I liked to bend a few rules, and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for my own pleasure; my own pride. I didn't think there was a cause more important than me. </p> <p>Then I found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken arms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me. I was dumped in a dark cell, and left to die. I didn't feel so tough anymore. When they discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. They couldn't set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. When I didn't get better, and was down to about a hundred pounds, they put me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life. </p> <p>I was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went home, they would use it as propaganda to demoralise my fellow prisoners. Our code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and there were men who had been shot down before me. I thought about it, though. I wasn't in great shape, and I missed everything about America. But I turned it down. </p> <p>A lot of prisoners had it worse than I did. I'd been mistreated before, but not as badly as others. I always liked to strut a little after I'd been roughed up to show the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned down their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before. For a long time. And they broke me. </p> <p>When they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honour to serve with. Because every day they fought for me. </p> <p>I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's. </p> <p>I'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God. </p> <p>If you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist in our armed forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public office. Feed a hungry child. Teach an illiterate adult to read. Comfort the afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be the better, and you will be the happier. Because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself. </p> <p>I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank Him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me. </p> <p>Fight for what's right for our country. </p> <p>Fight for the ideals and character of a free people. </p> <p>Fight for our children's future. </p> <p>Fight for justice and opportunity for all. </p> <p>Stand up to defend our country from its enemies. </p> <p>Stand up for each other; for beautiful, blessed, bountiful America. </p> <p>Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history. </p> <p>Thank you, and God bless you.</p>",

(Scroll down for photograph.) Shortly, we'll hear what's surely the most important speech of John McCain's life \u2014 the one for which his whole political career has been a preparation. Liveblogging starts now.</p> <p><strong>8.45pm (all times local)</strong>: Cindy McCain is wowing the crowd with a speech about McCain as loving father, war hero, fantastic husband and war hero. \"We love Cindy!\" read the banners held aloft by the crowd. Now she's singing the praises of \"hockey mom, basketball shootin', moose-huntin', fly-fishin', pistol-packing mother of five for vice president.\" Her delivery's fairly wooden, but it's doing the trick. Cindy McCain is an exceedingly savvy businesswoman who keeps John McCain in ready money, and her global charity work is hugely impressive. But she's not a public speaker. Then again, neither is John McCain, usually.</p> <p>\"I think John was a hero in Vietnam!\" Shall we play wartime-references bingo? First one to spot 40 of them tonight wins a prize. Cindy's got to keep going, because the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/03/AR2008090303255.html?hpid=topnews\">football hasn't finished yet</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.50pm</strong>: I was racing from location to location when the video tribute to Cindy McCain was showing, so I didn't feel justified in being snarky about it. So I shall simply <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/213685.php\">quote Josh Marshall</a>: \"EDITING GOOF: They left out the part about how John was married when they started dating.\" </p> <p><strong>8.54pm</strong>: Here's a good piece about what John McCain needs to say in his speech tonight, and about how he's <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/mccains_speech_what_does_he_ne.html\">got to reach beyond the convention hall to the country</a>. Chris Cilizza is presumably right that McCain is going to talk in much more detail about the incredible hardships he suffered as a prisoner of war, which is probably going to make me feel guilty for joking about how often he mentions it. The other key points: he needs to focus on the economy, and banish the perception he's out of touch with ordinary, financially stretched Americans. And a crucial question: how far he'll distance himself from George Bush, and how the crowd in the hall will respond, because it'll indicate how far Bush-loving conservatives have truly jumped on board the McCain bandwagon.</p> <p><strong>8.59pm</strong>: Warning: Republicans dancing! Or shuffling to left and then to the right, in an embarrassing, socially conservative way. It's not pleasant, even though Johnny B Goode is a very good tune. </p> <p><strong>9.03pm</strong>: OK please stop now.</p> <p>Time for a photograph of the crazy new podium, which I took a few minutes ago during the video tribute to Cindy McCain: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337320632\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/9/5/1220580519340/hall.jpg\" alt=\"Convention hall\" width=\"459\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>9.05pm</strong>: John McCain video tribute time! He was a POW. No, <em>for real</em>. This is beyond parody, I'm afraid, so don't expect any parody from me. Now a man with a syrupy voice, like the guy on the cinema trailers, is essentially saying that America would have to be discontinued entirely if it weren't fortunate to have McCain running for president in these terrible times. (Oh! I'm told it's Fred Thompson.)</p> <p><strong>9.15pm</strong>: And here he is, in a scary halo of light, as if he were a Celebrity, or the Messiah. Much crowd applause, but it's not on the Palin level.</p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong>: He's got a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/03/the-lime-green-monster-mc_n_105044.html\">green screen behind him again</a>! That's a disastrous choice. He accepts the nomination and careens straight in to some Bush love. \"I'm grateful to the President for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable.\" He thanks his wife, his mother, Americans, everyone. </p> <p>\"Finally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration.\" Not Sarah Palin's, though. She thinks you are ridiculous, Obama, and she will mock you for having been a community organiser, and throw moose-antlers in your way to trip you up.</p> <p><strong>9.24pm</strong>: \"I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement. But let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election.\" Oh, all right, that's the bipartisanship over with. </p> <p><strong>9.26pm</strong>: A serious commotion, as two Code Pink-looking protestors reveal themselves, flash peace signs, and get dragged out by security, thereby amping the crowd up by about 100%. They're almost as loud as they were for Palin yesterday now. Well done Code Pink! Or Republican operatives in disguise, if that's what you really are.</p> <p>McCain chuckles in his trademark sinister fashion and picks up the thread again, which is about how he understands that times are tough. He promises to \"stand on your side\", which sounds painful.</p> <p><strong>9.28pm</strong>: Praising Palin. \"She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and nose...\" He ACTUALLY PAUSES HERE. Her nose? Oh, I see: \"...Worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries.\" I seriously thought he was going to give us an Eskimo joke then.</p> <p><strong>9.31pm</strong>: He's happy to have introduced Palin to the country, but he can't wait to introduce her to Washington. She and he are maverick reformer mavericks, who will completely maverick the place up when they get there, \"there\" being, of course, the place McCain has been for many years.</p> <p><strong>9.34pm</strong>: Now he's taking credit for the surge in Iraq. \"I don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life.\"</p> <p>\"I fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market, so I let them live in one of my spare houses.\" Actually I made that last part up. He works for other ordinary Americans too, including a soldier who died in Iraq, whose bracelet he wears every day. </p> <p><strong>9.37pm</strong>: \"I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption...\" He's talking about how \"both parties\" made government bigger and gave in to oil dependency \u2014 the crowd is silent. Silent. They're uneasy about this, I think. Bit too maverick. Then he vows to \"change that,\" and they're back cheering again. </p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Things \"we\" believe in: low taxes, open markets, \"a culture of life\", faith, work, service, and THE RULE OF LAW. And now it's call-and-response time: \"I will keep taxes low, my opponent will raise them.\" (\"Boo!\") \"I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it.\" Obama's healthcare plan will force you to use a system where \"a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.\" Biggest boos yet. Bureaucrats! Imagine.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: Choice in schools. Choice in schools. No bureaucrats, just choice, lovely choice.</p> <p><strong>9.46pm</strong>: \"My fellow Americans, when I'm President, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades.\" NOT THE LADDER TO SPACE?!! Seriously?? All right. This is going to be cool. John McCain is going to build a ladder to space.</p> <p>Oh, hang on, it's energy independence.</p> <p>\"We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now.\" Drill, drill. \"Drill baby drill!\" the crowd shout, troublingly. </p> <p><strong>9.49pm</strong>: Terrorism time. Al Qaeda still poses a threat, and so does Russia. We must support the Georgians. \"We can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people.\" There are lots of threats in this dangerous world and we should all be very scared, but John McCain isn't scared. He will fight.</p> <p>\"I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't.\" Feel the experience!</p> <p><strong>9.52pm</strong>: Wartime experiences, but not in much detail, and, by McCain standards, really not overplayed at all, nicely done. That can't be it, surely...?</p> <p><strong>9.54pm</strong>: \"The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it.\" Not like Barack Obama, who has read too many self-help books and is on a journey of personal discovery.</p> <p>\"I have that record [of experience], and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.\"</p> <p><strong>9.57pm</strong>: \"Long ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes...\" Ah, OK, that part before wasn't all there was. After a bit on accountability and bipartisanship, we're into the details of his prisoner-of-war experiences. He'd been a selfish young man, but when he was dumped in a dark cell in Hanoi and left to die.\" Crowd is yelling, weeping. McCain is going into detail about the violence he suffered in captivity.</p> <p><strong>10.01pm</strong>: \"When they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor to serve with.\" Powerful stuff; standing ovations from the crowd.</p> <p><strong>10.04pm</strong>: \"I'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it.\" Anti-Obama, obviously.</p> <p>He's urging everyone to do public service, instead -- implicitly -- of whining about hope and change. Nothing brings greater happiness than serving a cause greater than yourself, eg., Getting John McCain Elected. \"I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me.\" Fight fight fight!</p> <p>Fight for what's right! Fight for America! Stand up to defend America! Stand up! Fight! </p> <p>...And it's over. Wow, that was fighty, the end part.</p> <p><strong>10.07pm</strong>: Here's Cindy and John and the moosehunter, doing some Hillary Pointing. </p> <p><strong>10.09pm</strong> BALLOONS! I like balloons. Balloons are the whole point of American political conventions. The elitist Barack Obama didn't have any balloons, because he considered himself to be above them, and also because Invesco Field didn't have a roof, so a balloon drop was unfeasible. But maverick John McCain gives you balloons. (Two hundred thousand of them, apparently.) Balloons and confetti. Vote for John McCain, balloon maverick. </p> <p>They're playing Rhythm Is A Dancer now. Rhythm may be a dancer, but the Michigan delegation are not. </p> <p>Raising McCain. That song again.</p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong> Well, that was underwhelming and underpowered. (Apart from the balloons.) I thought it was telling that he seemed only to be able to rouse the crowd to emotion by explicitly chanting \"fight!\", \"fight!\". The distancing-from-Bush part, and the attack on the party, really didn't seem to go down well. He was light on policy, and not \u2014 I thought, though it's a very personal thing \u2014&#xa0;particularly warm or personable at all. Will tonight's performance drain some of the Palinthusiasm from the party faithful? We'll have to see.</p> <p><a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/213710.php\">TPM:</a> \"I'm insulted that McCain uses a lifeless speech to hide his lack of specific policy proposals.\"<br><a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/the_speech_2.html\">Swampland:</a> \"Mixed performance\" \u2014 Jay Carney also notes how much more excited and powerful McCain is when he's talking about something that excites him, namely, fighting.</p> <p>They're playing <a href=\"http://www.lyricsdownload.com/sly-and-the-family-stone-everyday-people-lyrics.html\">Everyday People</a>, now. Anti-elitist music.</p> <p><strong>10.31pm</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=interview_with_mccain_heckler\">An interview</a> with one of the protestors dragged from the hall, who turns out to be a Ron Paul supporter.</p> <p>...My colleague Richard Adams points out a significant quotation I missed in the frenzy of liveblogging \u2014&#xa0;a line that might not please immigration-hardliner Republicans: \"We believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans.\"</p> <p>I also failed to notice his reference earlier to how the party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan \"is going to get back to basics.\" This reference <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_Basics_(campaign)\">sits ill with Brits</a>...</p> <p>Right, off to talk to delegates now.</p> <p>====</p> <p>POSTSCRIPT</p> <p><strong>11.15pm</strong>: Interesting... With the caveat that this means nothing at all, I just spent a few moments mingling with delegates and their guests streaming out of the convention hall, and the contrast with last night couldn't be much starker. They weren't pumped up at all; almost everyone to whom I spoke felt the need to offer some kind of apology or justification for McCain's poor performance tonight. </p> <p>The very first person I stopped, Jerrod Atkinson from Dallas \u2014 a guest of the Texas delegation, not a delegate himself \u2014 said: \"Terrible. It was just full of emptiness, and what I see as empty promises. Any time I saw a stance, it wasn't a Republican stance. I really, really liked Sarah Palin's speech. I kinda wish we could have reversed the ticket: Palin/McCain. But apparently it's too late for that...\"</p> <p>But to be fair, he was the exception: everyone else delivered some kind of praise. \"I thought it communicated the essence of John McCain: he's sincere, and he's dedicated,\" said Karen Pausman, a Texas delegate (in regulation Stars-and-Stripes shirt and cowboy hat). She'd been impressed with McCain's remarks on energy policy. \"He never has been a strong speaker, but he had a lot of content. He has the gravitas to say I've put my money where my mouth is for my country.\" Which was better, McCain's speech, or Palin's? \"Palin's a better \u2014 I'm thinking of the right word \u2014 Palin's a better entertainer,\" she said. </p> <p>Paul Kramer, also a Texas delegate: \"He addressed the one thing we're concerned with most, which is our safety as Americans in the world. That's what's most important to us. We're facing a group that's set on our destruction as much as Adolf Hitler was.\" </p> <p>Fred Radewagen, a Hawaiian delegate, on the contrast between Palin and McCain: \"You can't compare apples and oranges.\"</p> <p>====</p> <p><strong>11.25pm</strong> Here endeth the liveblogging of the 2008 Democratic and Republican conventions. Tomorrow I'll fly back to elitist Washington, DC to sip on elitist coffee drinks. My regular Campaign Diary <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/burkeman/\">blog</a> continues. And of course there'll be more liveblogging at the debates. Or perhaps before. Thanks for reading and commenting. Now I must sleep.</p>"
