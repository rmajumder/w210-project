  "<p>Theres a certain misty-eyed look that parents exchange when they gaze fondly upon their youngest and decide he is old enough to take camping. As his proud mother says, our two-year-old is so like a grown-up. And he really is. He is so like a grown-up who is just coming round from concussion. If you ask him how many fingers youre holding up, he will pick a number between one and \"tenty-10\". If you ask him his name, he will giggle and tell you he wants ice cream, but not poo flavour (mint choc-chip to us). And when you put him in the car, he will holler and struggle and go perfectly nuts, much as he did when we took him to Millets to help us choose a tent.</p> <p>His absolute dedication to wrecking the home of outdoor discounting was the reason I hastily bought the Diablo 900, a tent so vulgarly capacious that only a dad utterly distracted by a rampaging toddler in a tent shop could possibly have been daft enough to buy it. The Diablo is a cathedral of camping, a Xanadu in ripstop nylon. With four double bedrooms, it is bigger than our house, and nearly as heavy. Millets lent me a sherpa to help lug it from the shop to the car. The sherpas name badge said he was Dave. Dave told me: \"This tent is, like, well massive.\"</p> <p>Our two-year-old hates the car so much because he's never really sure, each time we bundle him in, whether were just popping down to the shops or leaving home never to return. So it was a suspicious look he gave me as we loaded the Diablo into the Renault, along with our duvets, casseroles, skillets, hardback first editions and the dining-room chairs (the Diablo was so diabolically expensive that there were no funds left for camping furniture). </p> <p>Our four-year-old said: \"Wow, were taking everything ! Will we be back in time for me to go to big school?\" Our toddler burst into tears. On the drive down, he screamed like a B-movie zombie. (I swear our next car will be a London taxi cab with a glass partition between the undead and their parents.)</p> <p>Finally, we arrived near Chichester. The campsite was entirely made of tofu and crystals. The loos were composting loos. The electricity was green to the point of not existing. A bearded white man in a turquoise kaftan meditated under an awning. It was the awning of the age of Aquarius. I was already missing Sherpa Dave. I know he would have said: \"This campsite is, like, well organic.\" But the hippies were friendly, and half a dozen of them helped us to pitch the Diablo a tent so aptly named that after the sixth attempt at threading the poles even turquoise Zen man used a naughty word.</p> <p>Afterwards, we watched a family with daughters named Hermione and Ambrosia ghost up in a Prius and erect a Mongolian yurt. They accomplished this with the harmony and choreographed precision of a dance troupe. My wife turned to me and said, with quiet gravity: \"Darling, zeese are not our people.\" My wife is so defiantly French that I would have expected to travel further than Chichester before meeting a people so alien that the difference between them and us trumped the difference between me and her. But before I could hum La Marseillaise, the sun went down which on a green campsite means bedtime.</p> <p>A question friends ask us about our camping weekend is: \"Did your kids sleep?\" And the answer is: \"No, as a matter of fact they did not. At. All. They pinged around all night like bats playing with sonar and they had just the best time absolutely ever.\" It was infectious, if not entirely restful. Overheard in the night, from deep within the Mongolian yurt:</p> <p>\"Daddy, why are those naughty boys in that tent making so much din?\"</p> <p>\"They're not like us, Ambrosia.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, Daddy ... I wonder why people like that even come camping.\"</p> <p>We thought the girl was, like, well perceptive.</p> <p>\u2022 Next instalment: What happened when the rain started!

  "<p>Take one Geordie, who loves spending his holidays slowly parboiling in factor 8 by the sea. Take one long-distance Lisbonite boyfriend, who can do that almost all year and prefers a frenzied week of sightseeing and activity. Put them together to decide their first summer holiday and what do you get? Well, let's gloss over the inglorious argument and move on to the glorious compromise: Croatia.</p> <p>With its convulsive past and rugged coastline - a thousand islands spraying from it like a meteor trail - Dalmatia offers a dizzying combination of history and sun-drenched beaches. Rocky beaches, true, but with unrivalled settings. Take Bacvice Bay (beach 1) just 10 minutes' walk from Ana and Miki's Guesthouse, ideally located in Split's charming, higgledy-piggledy sidestreets. </p> <p>Yes, there are other beaches where you can stretch out in golden, bonewarming heat and swim in sea that feels as gentle as spring sunshine on the back of your neck. There may even be bars with the same strange geometric architecture, delicious mojitos and captivating views as Bacvicebar. But there's nowhere else you can spend a lazy afternoon watching a unique sport, picigin, the peculiar and almost indescribable combination of waterpolo and pingpong invented here.</p> <p>Beach 2 was just four hours away by Jadrolinija's dawn ferry, winding gorgeously through that meteor tail, to the island of Korcula. Though it markets itself as the birthplace of Marco Polo, Korcula Town would do just as well to emphasise its nearby coves, from where the gentlest of swims unveils a jaw-dropping view of uncannily well-preserved medieval walls and fearsome forts. One of which doubles as a spectacular cocktail lounge, Massimo, reached by a terrifyingly rickety stepladder, though well worth it for the panoramic Adriatic sunsets.</p> <p>Beach 3 lay underneath Odisej, the only hotel on the island of Mljet,<br>population 1,100. It's one of Croatia's most verdant national parks and where, according to legend, Odysseus lay bewitched for seven years (just ask hotel concierge, Antun, who doubles as the island's published historian). Sip a cocktail at the bar, then dip into the crystalline, body temperature waters and you'll wonder why Odysseus went back to frumpy Penelope.</p> <p>By fluke we saved the best till last - Apartment St Jakov, run by the gracious Jelka and her extraordinarily welcoming family. It is perfectly situated between Dubrovnik and the deserted, densely forested island of Lokrum with its craggy, whisper-silent, private inlets (beaches 4 and 5).</p> <p>Lazing on Belvedere beach (6), with its vibrant bars, gregarious locals, heart-jolting watersports and sublime view of Dubrovnik, you'd never guess the whole stretch of visible coast had been bombed just 17 years before. The only clues are the shelled ruins of the hotel directly above. But perhaps this is Croatia's secret: it knows how to wear its tumultuous past closely, but lightly. And did I mention the beaches? Next year's row will be about how to top this.</p> <p><strong>Jaime Gill </strong>from London has won a trip to Damascus with Black Tomato.</p> <h2>Hot tropics<br>Costa Rica</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337082276\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Beach1.jpg\" alt=\"Costa Rica, La Cusinga Lodge\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beach near La Cusinga Lodge, Costa Rica</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>La Cusinga Lodge, sandwiched between the vaulting canopy trees of the Marino Ballena national park and the vast, coral-rich Pacific coastline, is carved out of a beautiful, unspoilt chunk of tropical forest. It is one of several rainforest ecolodges in the Zona Sur, a landscape punctuated by beaches, rugged mountains and multicoloured flora and fauna, and features seven hydro or solar-powered cabinas, made of wood from the lodge's sustainable teak plantation.</p> <p>We head out on a gentle trek through the surrounding forest with a local guide, who points out flashes of bright feathers and a mere glimpse of the elusive Baird's tapir. We spend the afternoon on a bright white beach; the only other visitors are hundreds of tiny white crabs which disappear into punctures in the wet sand as our feet approach. It is a far cry from the surfer and property developer-heavy Pacific beaches further north. </p> <p>The lodge has lent us a pair of bodyboards so we paddle out to catch the odd wave, scouring the trees for sloths as we're whisked into shore.</p> <p>The dining area is outside, overlooking the national park. Papaya and casado (literally \"married person\"), a plate of fish, salad and red and white beans, are washed down with, a cool long drink of fruit and ice blended with milk or water. Everything has been caught or grown on site. </p> <p>As we fall asleep, howler monkeys let out throaty laughs just inches from our window.

The Standard, a boutique hotel-cum-spa by Andre Balazs, tucked away on the causeway that links to the mainland, is where you retire to if you're a Rolling Stone. It's set in gardens complete with totem pole, Roman waterfall hot tub and a saltwater pool overlooking the bay; locals drop by on their yachts to make use of the spa facilities at the Centre for Integral Living (what it's integral to is anyone's guess), or ingest a tiger prawn or two in the outdoor restaurant. Pool-side is the ideal people-watching spot, where you'd be hard pushed to find a bigger age gap between the sexes. </p> <p>You need a devil-may-care attitude and a crate of St Tropez not to feel self-conscious in Miami Beach, but at the Standard there's no such thing as judgmental. If you can afford to be there you've earned it and the cabana boys dispense towels and sunbeds on a first-come-first-served basis to everyone regardless of how many entries in the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame they have. </p> <p>The hotel is a five-minute drive to South Beach (SoBe) but after a day or two in the seclusion of the Standard, the boardwalk seems hectic and we miss the constant smell of cedar and the echo of ambient whale music. Miami nightlife is infamous, but it's not immediately apparent where \"the scene\" actually is. Many clubs are attached to the hotels on Collins Avenue and Washington Avenue and, surprisingly for the city that hosts the Ultra Music Festival, the overwhelming genre is \"lounge\". One of the latest clubs to open is called Heathrow Lounge - who says the Americans don't do irony? <br><strong>Liz Stephens, London</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Standard (+305 673-1717; <a href=\"http://www.standardhotels.com/miami\">standardhotels.com/miami</a>).</p> <h2>Something blue<br>Croatia</h2> <p>My fiancee put his foot down when he found me on the pavement outside the church, trying to estimate the trajectory of confetti in a south-westerly breeze. Organising our wedding, I had become a bridezilla and he was concerned for my nuptial health. I was prescribed sun, sea and an embargo on mobile phones, and taken on holiday to the Croatian island of Kolocep, where neither of the two shops stocked bridal magazines.</p> <p>It was thirty minutes by speedboat from Dubrovnik, and as we approached the main bay of Donje Celo, with its rocky vistas and calm blue waters, I forgot all about the vicar's lisp and his inability to pronounce my name. We checked in to the only hotel on the island, and for the next four days enjoyed the heat and sunshine. After breakfast of pastries and coffee my fiancee would retire to the shade of our balcony while I loped down to the pool to baste myself like a chicken in 30C heat. It was a peaceful area bar the occasional invasion of kids, who triggered the inevitable concerns about wedding budgets and how much a toddler was likely to eat.</p> <p>Thankfully, young families weren't inclined to walk a mile across the island's saddle to Gornje Celo, for lunch at the island's best konoba (a family run inn). If the sound of crashing waves and the smell of lemon groves and thyme weren't enough to calm the soul then a litre of ros\u00e9 and local gurnard served with garlicky chips always did the trick.</p> <p>By day five, I was still waking at 3am and attempting to draft a speech for the groom, but I'd resigned myself to being a fat yet happy bride.<br><strong>Hannah Begbie, London</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Hotel Villas Kolocep (+385 20 757 025; <a href=\"http://www.kolocep.com\">kolocep.com</a>).</p> <h2>Greek charm<br>Corfu</h2> <p>I was given a set of nail polishes when I was 11. In varying shades of pink, they were named after exotic island destinations: Corfu, Corsica and Capri. \"Corfu\" was the pinkest and prettiest of them all and in my mind became synonymous with glamour. </p> <p>Flash forward and I'm finally going. Two friends and I hire a villa on secluded Kaminaki beach where there are only a handful of properties, two sleepy tavernas, a tiny general store and a few elderly couples and families sheltering under sun umbrellas. We were desperate to avoid the more touristy parts of Corfu but maybe went overboard in our search for quiet.</p> <p>Our routine of morning swims and days spent reading and chatting by the pool makes the week fly by, but by Thursday, cabin - or perhaps cove - fever kicks in so we dine at the Taverna Agni up the coast, whose staff collect us by speedboat. We're greeted on the steps of the taverna by George, an adroit 20-something flirt. We should know better than to fall for the clich\u00e9d charms of a Greek waiter but he's such a sweetie that we agree to return on Saturday night.</p> <p>We do, and get tipsy over dinner then pile into speedboats with a couple of other patrons and George. At a beach bar down the coast we contribute in our own small way to the drunken party scene we were so sniffy about back home. Oops. </p> <p>Next day, we reluctantly snake up the steep road away from Kaminaki. Suntanned and happy, I think I've proven the merit in my method of choosing holiday destinations. Corsica and Capri are calling ...<br><strong>Bridget Beale, London</strong></p> <h2>Return ticket<br>Goa</h2> <p>\"Never go back\" is usually good advice for anyone nostalgic for idyllic holiday spots visited long ago. But desperately needed R&amp;R and an indecently cheap last-minute break have returned me to Goa, where I spent the winters 20 years ago.</p> <p>A motorcycle taxi takes me to Anjuna to revisit old haunts. I'm disappointed to find the beach front crowded with bars and stalls. The Shore Bar, where everyone would congregate at sunset for chillums and trance music has been renamed Sunset. None of my old cronies are there and I feel bereft and old. My old house is derelict and unused now that Anjuna is packed with hotels. </p> <p>Walking back over the headland, my spirits lift; there are lizards, cashew-nut trees and colourful birds. There's a crashing sound in the bush and a hanuman langur lopes across the path, stopping to stare at me. Sea eagles soar and dolphins break the ocean's surface as the setting sun glows red.</p> <p>In the noisy chaos of Calangute, the beach seems remarkably free of hassling vendors but I miss the cows stealing my fruit. I move to the southern end, where a maze of quiet lanes contains small family guesthouses. Victor and Lourdes, a Christian couple, run Vilo Villa - the kitchen is closed (there are no other guests) but they happily open up the best room for me and offer a huge discount. It's time for evening mass, and the little church is packed, the congregation overflowing into the square outside. The mass, in Konkani, sounds beautiful.</p> <p>On my last night, sitting on the balcony listening to the surf and watching huge bats swoop past the full moon, I reflect that I've learnt another lesson in that way India has of teaching you. I've chilled, exercised and eaten well in a beautiful place with lovely people. No, you can't go back, but if you are prepared to grow and change, you might find yourself going forward.<br><strong>Bob Williams, London</strong></p> <h2>Big fat wedding<br>Greece</h2> <p>We were welcomed to the undeveloped island of Kythera with handshakes and kisses. It was an effusive greeting, but this was no ordinary beach holiday - it had a Greek/Scottish wedding as its highlight.</p> <p>In the hamlet of Avlemonas, white tavernas clustered round a sparkling blue cove, a casual visitor might have been surprised by the number of red-faced Scots chatting at the tables.</p> <p>The celebrations kicked off with a moonlit barbecue at Kaladi, a beach dramatically framed by rock stacks, and so the wedding day began by slumbering off a hangover in the shade. Occasionally we scuttled over scorching sand to snorkel in clear sea.</p> <p>Those brave enough to wear thick kilts under the Greek sun provoked incredulous looks as we climbed into the minibus for the journey up the steep hill to where a white church bathed in the peachy light of the sinking sun. An island idyll was spread out below us, a scent of wild thyme filled the air, and the kilted groom waited for his Greek bride.</p> <p>Flurries of rice and glasses of sweet liqueur marked the end of the ceremony. When the party arrived back in Avlemonas it proceeded down the only street to the applause of all the Saturday night diners. It struck me that I felt like I was in a movie and that's what all weddings strive to do - make the participants feel like they are stars for the day.<br><strong>Simon Stronach, Edinburgh</strong></p> <h2>Texas seashore<br>USA</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337082356\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Beach2.jpg\" alt=\"Arkansas wildlife refuge, Texas\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Road to armadillo... Arkansas wildlife refuge, Texas</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evelyn Owen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My expectations of Texan beaches were not high. Blackened sand, derricks looming through the haze and the occasional passing oil tanker didn't sound like the makings of a relaxing weekend at the seaside. </p> <p>I won't pretend that it wasn't a bit like that, but between the refineries, smokestacks and pylons lie little patches of unspoilt Gulf Coast where alligators lurk in swampy splendour.</p> <p>Padre Island National Seashore, 65 miles of sandy barrier beaches and dunes, forms a white streak between the salty Laguna Madre and the Gulf of Mexico. Cruising along the island's only road, we made for the Malaquite visitor centre, a tranquil spot to catch some sun and take a dip. Tranquil, that is, until a Portuguese man of war came floating out of the water and settled on the sand, gently heaving and glistening in the sun. These electric blue creatures are common the length of Padre Island, and not to be trifled with. The beaches are still eminently swimmable; you just need to keep your wits about you. </p> <p>Heading north, there's another wildlife hotspot: Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, which bursts with all manner of wild beasts, including an armadillo that shuffled across the road ahead of us, and several endangered sea turtles. From tankers to turtles, Texas is truly surprising.<br><strong>Evelyn Owen, Birmingham</strong></p> <h2>Say cheese<br>Sicily</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337082357\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Beach3.jpg\" alt=\"Riserva dello Zingaro, Sicily\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rescued... the Riserva dello Zingaro, Sicily</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hellen Norman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I drove across Sicily down the A29 from Palermo to Trapani in 40C heat, Luke begged me to pull over and improvise a shower with a bottle of San Pellegrino. Refreshed, we scrutinised the map. The Riserva dello Zingaro was our destination; a traffic-free nature reserve in one of the few areas of Sicily that have been spared development. Work had already started on a coastal road through it in the 1970s when environmentalists began campaigning for its conservation. Then a persuasive press campaign in 1981 awakened public sensibilities to the precious jewel that was about to be destroyed. The Riserva dello Zingaro became a ward of the state forestry commission.</p> <p>We were about to continue on our way when a white van pulled up, flanking our car and effectively preventing us from moving. Having lived in Sicily for several years, I'm not easily given to fantasies about concrete boots and horses' heads, but we were in the middle of nowhere, isolated. Three sets of eyes burned into us from behind dark glasses. I maintained what I hoped was an intimidating gaze. Finally, the driver of the van spoke, gruffly.</p> <p>\"Volete assaggiare dei formaggi?\" I suppressed a smile, my adrenaline levels plummeted, and I assured him that, no thank you, we wouldn't like any cheese, we'd just eaten. </p> <p>Stopping off at the little supermarket a mile or two down the road, I checked over my shoulder before ordering two of what must be the world's tastiest sandwiches, packed with layer upon layer of mozzarella and Parma ham. When we arrived, we left our car at the top of the hill. Sixteen square kilometres of unspoiled coastline unfolded before us as we trekked down amid wild grasses and caper plants towards the San Vito lo Capo peninsula: stark, volcanic rock and crystalline waters rendered turquoise by the blazing sun.</p> <p>Wading into the cool, clear sea, someone waved to me. I raised a sheepish hand to the cheese seller, and made a mental note to hide my sandwiches. <br><strong>Hellen Norman, Cambridge</strong></p> <h2>Monkeying around<br>Kenya</h2> <p>It's 7am. The lagoon is a mirror, perfectly reflecting the sun rising over the Indian Ocean. The white, palm-fringed beach stretches out of sight and I shift contentedly in my hammock. I have woken up to this view every morning for two weeks.</p> <p>Suddenly the peace is shattered by a loud scream. It's another dawn raid. I sit bolt upright. Seconds later I spot them; shadowy figures dropping out of the trees and running towards the tents, emitting ear-piercing shrieks. In an instant they are among us, looting and plundering. </p> <p>I flop back into my hammock. Every day my reverie has been destroyed by this troop of monkeys tearing around the campsite, causing havoc, stealing food, banging pots and jumping on tents. They've lost any of the endearing qualities I thought they possessed on our first meeting.</p> <p>Monkeys aside, Tiwi Beach (south of Mombassa) is inarguably relaxing. At Twiga Lodge, a campsite on the least developed part of the beach, you can set up a tent for only a few pounds a night, or sleep in a hammock. It's basic but there's a great atmosphere, and fantastic snorkelling in several large rock pools nearby.</p> <p>Kisite Marine Park makes an easy day trip by boat, with crystal water, pristine coral and multicoloured fish.</p> <p>The monkeys may give me a rude awakening, showering twigs on to my face from the trees above, but with a long day of eating, drinking and sunbathing ahead of me, I think I can probably live with it. <br><strong>Ewan McCowen, Edinburgh</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Twiga Lodge, Tiwi beach (<a href=\"http://www.twigalodge.com\">twigalodge.com</a>).</p>",
  "<h2>Who should pay when the elderly need care?</h2> <p>More of the familiar selfish complaints on the cost of institutional care for the elderly (Your Shout, August 23), and from a person who is apparently both indifferent yet very concerned about the depletion of a potential inheritance. </p> <p>Such people would do well to consider that in many European countries, for instance France and Belgium, the burden of long-term care can fall on the children after their parents' capital is exhausted. It is a great worry to a friend of mine, whose mother is already living in straitened circumstances now that her husband's Alzheimer's requires permanent residential care, and who faces the depressing prospect of himself having to shoulder the burden. If your correspondent lived in such a country, there would be a lot more point to these perverse and empty sophistries about the sense it makes to spend, spend, spend. Why not count the blessings we enjoy over here?</p> <p><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <p>The anonymous person who complained about the need to sell his family home to pay for his mother's care would have learned this week that the situation is unlikely to change because the number of elderly has now exceeded the number of teenagers. One of the reasons that universal old age care cannot be given is that politicians could not disobey the electorate reluctance to pay the required level of taxation. </p> <p> May I also point out to this person that the parents would have been granted, until the early 90s, tax relief on their mortgage interest - a subsidy paid by other taxpayers including those too poor to be granted a mortgage. My parents were in this category. House inflation has given property owners a large amount of profit, making it easier for them to pay for their care.</p> <p>The loss of inheritance is partly caused by successful medicine, allowing people to live longer which eventually leaves many of them so infirm that they need residential care. </p> <p><strong>Bill Coughlan,</strong> Chelmsford, Essex</p> <p> At 66 I look after my disabled, dotty husband. </p> <p>I have just been in contact with Richard Burden, our MP, about having another cushion to raise the height of his lounge chair. The district nurse's office said that we were only allowed one as they were expensive. We were told that my husband could pick up the cushion from the kitchen and carry it with him through to the lounge when he wanted to change chairs. As he cannot move without a walking frame (he was blown up saving this country in 1944), and cannot possibly think ahead, this suggestion is not feasible.</p> <p> I pointed out to Richard Burden that we have both paid National Insurance all our lives, both paid into pensions, bought our own house (which is an utterly basic semi-detached), and have just enough savings to put us over the limit to receive any sort of help or assistance. No, my mistake, I got two grab handles and a garden step. </p> <p>In my next life I fully intend to eat gluttonously, live riotously, drink freely, smoke heavily, possibly experiment with drugs, and definitely not save any money.</p> <p>Please, \"name and address supplied\", do the same. </p> <p><strong>KM Whalley,</strong> Birmingham</p> <p>There are a few things worth considering before we decide that there is no point in saving if all our assets are then used to pay for our care in old age.</p> <p> I work as a social worker for older people and, in my experience, it can make an enormous difference to their quality of life if they have their own financial resources. </p> <p> If an older person needs a high level of care, and especially if they need care at night, social services will usually offer to provide this in a care home. Those in rented accommodation may, effectively, have little choice but to move into care, whether they want to or not. Those who own their own homes could, for example, get independent advice about equity release as a way of helping to pay for live-in care at home.</p> <p>Where people do want to move into a care home and are relying on state funding, it is social services that decides whether this can happen and where the older person can live. As a rule, social services supports people to live at home as long as it is practical and cost-effective for them to do so. If an older person wants to move into a care home when it is still possible and less expensive to look after them at home, the funding is unlikely to be agreed.</p> <p> If funding is agreed, social services is then likely to offer the least expensive care home place available at the time and, if the older person has no family able to pay a \"top-up\", this is usually where they move to. It may work very well, but they have precious little choice.</p> <p> So the two-tier system is alive and kicking and is likely to remain so until we are improbably converted to paying higher taxes. Those who have money or assets are much more able to choose for themselves where they live and when they move. People without generally have those decisions made for them by their local authority.</p> <p><strong>Susanna Watson, </strong>Bath</p> <h2>Paperless billing isn't as green as you think</h2> <p>Regarding Richard Colbey's complaint about Virgin and its switch to paperless billing (On paper they may have point, but I'm not buying it, August 16): there is a deeper issue. </p> <p>Every time you/we switch on the computer, we are using electricity, say from 35 to 300 watts, depending on the computer. The electricity comes from a power station. Most of those in UK use coal. Multiplied by millions of computer users, that's a lot of carbon dioxide emissions and global warming. </p> <p>Paper is made from trees, which are renewable, but there are many other complicating factors including the energy required to manufacture paper, the vehicles and machinery of the postal services etc. It is my guesstimate that, in toto, computers are causing more global warming than paper bills.</p> <p>At the Centre for Learning, Organic Agriculture and Appropriate Technology in India, which has no connection to the electricity grid, computers require the largest outlay of solar and micro-hydro electrical energy. Paper is recycled or composted.</p> <p><strong>Brian Jenkins,</strong> via email</p> <h2>How trains can vanish when you book online </h2> <p>Rail Europe's website is generally the best available for booking European trains online but it has other idiosyncrasies besides those you mention (When a fare deal isn't all that fair, August 23). </p> <p>Try, for example, as I did, booking from Rome to Milan around 9am and you will get a message saying the system cannot find any trains to match the request. Change the request to 7am and the site produces a list of five services, the last of which leaves Rome at 9.30am. You have to play with the site to get the best results! You are right to suggest that the Swiss Rail site is excellent for timetable inquiries. So too is the German Rail site. And for journeys within either Switzerland or Germany, the respective websites allow you to print your own ticket on payment by credit card.</p> <p>Finally, you give as an example of differing Rail Europe prices by phone or internet London to Cologne. German Rail is almost always cheaper for this, but only sells international tickets by phone.</p> <p><strong>Michael Scaife,</strong> Alderley Edge, Cheshire</p> <h2>Me, a jobsworth? Here's my card</h2> <p>While I was travelling on National Express East Coast today, the train manager announced that forgetting to bring your railcard was a breach of the terms and conditions, and that they would no longer refund excess fares even if you were able to present a railcard at a later date. Clearly the train bosses read Guardian Money and have taken their cue from your jobsworth correspondent of August 16.</p> <p><strong>Theodore Hong,</strong> Cambridge</p> <p>I claim the right to reply to the rash and incorrect assumption by Howard Peters that I am a \"jobsworth\" (Your Shout, August 23). I take great care to have the correct papers with me, to pay the congestion charge on time and not to go overdrawn at my bank etc. This is because I do not want to give any jobsworth an opportunity to penalise me. For the record, I am a tax consultant.</p> <p><strong>Peter Salter, </strong>London</p> <p>Amid all the righteous indignation over forgotten rail passes, can I offer a practical solution? When you have your ticket, put it in the same wallet as your railcard. That way, if you have one, you have the other.</p> <p><strong>Henry Malt,</strong> Huntingdon</p> <p>On a recent day trip to London from Stevenage, I saved 50% on the part of the journey that fell within Hertfordshire, simply by producing my concessionary travel card.

  "<h2>Fizz goes out of Magners in summer sales chill</h2> <p>The amount of Magners cider sold in the UK is expected to sink by 15% for the six months to the end of August, with even steeper falls in Britain's pubs and bars. C&amp;C Group, the Irish company which led the \"over-ice\" renaissance in cider drinking, yesterday said an anticipated recovery in Magners sales volumes had not materialised in the last three months. It blamed \"the worsening economic environment, continuing competitive pressure and a slower realisation of the benefits of marketing initiatives\". C&amp;C said it expected difficult market conditions to continue at least until January.<br><strong>Simon Bowers</strong></p> <h2>Fund manager New Star's earnings slump 16%</h2> <p>New Star Asset Management yesterday reported a 16% slump in revenues to \u00a372.8m after a collapse in the value of its funds by more than \u00a33bn to \u00a319.8bn. The fund manager was among the top losers in London after the company slashed its dividend and said it did not expect market conditions to improve in the near future. Shares trading at more than 500p last year, fell to little more than 102p before climbing to 104p in the afternoon.

The company said yesterday there would be no redundancies or lay-offs among the 5,000-strong workforce as a result of the changes. India's Tata group, which acquired Land Rover and sister firm Jaguar this year, said it was important to match demand with supply. From next month until the end of the year, there will be no production of Discoveries or Sport models on Fridays and a \"slight slowing\" of the production line. Night shift manufacture of Range Rovers will be suspended from early October.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Property backlog fuels Rightmove profit surge</h2> <p>Property website Rightmove reported a 63% jump in first-half profits yesterday despite the worst downturn in the UK housing market since the early 1990s.

The company said growth was driven by a strong increase in new membership from lettings agents and new homes developers. These firms pay a monthly fee for each property featured on Rightmove and as it takes longer to achieve a sale in the current climate, developers are paying more than a year ago.<br><strong>Kathryn Hopkins</strong></p>",
  "<p>Seumas Milne makes excellent points about the vital need for counterbalance and rules in international relations (Georgia is the graveyard of America's unipolar world, August 28) but unfortunately loses his own sense of balance in doing so. He omits or forgets that only four years ago Putin's Russia was still engaged in a brutal, far more deadly war against its own secessionists in Chechnya. To compound the hypocrisy, it employed military overflights and border incidents to threaten its southern neighbour with dire consequences if it meddled in Russian internal affairs. Double standards, anyone? </p> <p>So if Moscow accepted his point about counterbalance then it would pull back its own troops to allow a truly impartial international peacekeeping force for South Ossetia, drawn from countries in the OSCE or beyond, rather than deploy an expeditionary force to demonstrate Russian regional hegemony. And yes, Milne is also right that all states behave better faced with a rules-based system and counterbalancing interests, even global superpowers (though when exactly did the US demand a 20km buffer zone around Kosovo or distribute US passports in Grozny?). Well, his wish is half-granted: when Bush is finally history, at least some hope exists that an Obama administration, while still defending US interests, could act differently in a new rules-based, multipolar world. </p> <p>But then Milne draws the wrong conclusion: the \"real gripe\" surely is not with \"economic rivalry\", which is always with us. It's the cynical behaviour of the Medvedev-Putin twins in this new multipolar world and the example it is setting for other regional powers - that international relations is a game where the rules can be torn up when the balance looks to be in your favour.<br><strong>Keith Jinks</strong><br>Korneuburg, Austria</p>",
  "<p>Thanks to TV show The Wire, most right-thinking people think they know Baltimore. A world away from re-ups, street rips, and the systematic failure of administrations to provide for civilians under their care, there's Ponytail. A hip band trading in a hectic and psychedelic chaos, this is a band who appear to reside, spiritually at least, in Brooklyn. Labelmates of the terrific Yeasayer, and makers of a tribal and complex take on the depths of psychedelic rock, they sound like Yoko Ono fronting a deranged jam band, though somehow quite catchily so. If that sounds a bit chaotic and contrived - and their current second album Ice Cream Spiritual assuredly does - then it's worth a bit of context. Available footage of them live makes a Ponytail gig look like a kind of ecstatic prog rock ceremony, and as strange as it may appear, it looks worth being part of.</p> <p>\u2022 Barden's Boudoir, N16, Thu 4; Liars Club, Nottingham, Fri 5</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Tudors </strong>(BBC2) is a historical drama that contains, to quote its own website, \"nudity, violence, adult content\". It is a version of the Tudors for people who are used to watching contemporary TV - say, 24. Henry VIII is played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who looks and acts like a rock god. He is vain, pompous, sentimental and out of touch with reality. He wears elaborate shirts, chunky jewellery and, I think, leather trousers. When he sees a woman he fancies, he simply gets off his horse and introduces himself. Then, in front of her husband, he kisses her and drags her off to bed.</p> <p>Henry is a bad man. But also tormented. He sits at his polished desk, fretting by candlelight. A word about the lighting: it's wonderfully over the top. This is a world of deep shadows, raked with shafts of bright light. In fact, everything seems over the top. When Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) has a miscarriage, she collapses in full view of the court, and the camera swoops to show us her bloodied fingers. </p> <p>This is brought to us by Michael Hirst, who made two films about Elizabeth I. To give you some idea of the sensibility at work here, a forthcoming episode features the beautiful Joss Stone as Anne of Cleves, supposedly the least attractive of Henry's wives. </p> <p>Last night's episode crammed a lot in: the split from the Catholic church, Henry having sex, the execution of Cardinal Fisher, Henry having sex again, the execution of Thomas More. There was a great scene in which Fisher, about to be beheaded, asks the crowd to give him courage; they cheer as the axe is lifted. </p> <p>That's one thing The Tudors has over 24: beheadings. </p> <p>If I tried to describe <strong>A1: The Road Musical</strong> (Channel 4), it would sound silly. It is a musical based on the trunk road that goes from London to Scotland. To say it was a celebration would not quite be right. It was totally bonkers - but weirdly memorable. </p> <p>It started in Smithfield, where the A1 begins. People in cars started singing about the A1, and their lives beyond the A1. A Polish migrant sang a spirited ditty about the girls of Peterborough. He was, I think, sitting at the top of a slide in the playground of a Happy Eater, or possibly a Little Chef. Or was I dreaming?</p>",
  "<p>Automatons - mechanical moving machines, usually in the form of living things - have fascinated humans for more than 2,000 years. In ancient Greece, the island of Rhodes was renowned for its automatons. They appear in myths, fairytales and literature (such as Philip Pullman's Clockwork), and have been engineered by people such as Jacques de Vaucanson, famous for his 18th-century mechanical defecating duck and flute player.</p> <p>Just what makes mechanical beings so strangely attractive to us is harder to answer. Has it to do with their being another example of humankind's attempt at playing God, reducing biology to cogs and springs? The magic and sorcery of the statue coming to life? Or the illusion of the self-will of something not quite alive?</p> <p>In his debut novel The Toymaker, Jeremy de Quidt has taken a number of popular elements of children's literature - the orphan, the circus, the well-to-do gent with villainous aims, and slavering wolves - to which he's added the tantalising mysteries of the automaton, and woven them together to create an intriguing and atmospheric plot all his own.</p> <p>Set in an unspecified Germanic country in an unspecified past (in the days of flintlock pistols), the story begins in a vivid narrative voice, with asides, wry comments and a quirky turn of phrase. As the novel progresses, however, this voice becomes less conversational and more conventional, as though it's the action alone that has caught De Quidt's imagination, and he wants as little as possible to come between this and the reader.</p> <p>The story is pacy, exciting and inventive with strong and interesting characters. It's violent in places too, with threats, torture (fingers snapped \"like dry twigs\"), and death. The hero, Mathias, seems to be constantly sustaining new and painful injuries. The plot is essentially a race to uncover a secret: a battle between good and evil and shades of grey in-between, but the revelation of the secret is really worth waiting for. This is no MacGuffin, here simply to justify the chase. It is a dark and dirty secret at the very heart of what the story is all about. It's a shame, therefore, that in a number of instances the positioning of an illustration gives so much away: pivotal moments can be seen at a glance, rather than when the writer chooses to reveal them in the text.</p> <p>My favourite character in The Toymaker is a minor figure, but one who - or should that be which? - nicely sums up the tone of the novel. Her name is Marguerite, an automaton doll in a fine court dress of tiny woven flowers and birds, kept in a battered green leather box. Belonging to the evil Dr Leiter, she has expressionless features, pretty lips and needle-like teeth, and serves just one purpose. Before her are placed two cards, one blue, one red. When a person tells the truth, she reaches out a dainty lifeless finger and touches the blue card. Whenever they lie, she touches the red. She is never wrong and is quite the most terrifying lie-detector one hopes never to meet.</p> <p>It's ironic that, with many remarkable examples of genuine automatons created over the centuries, probably the most famous is the Turk. This 18th-century chess-playing machine was, in fact, a hoax - with a man hidden inside it. The Toymaker's automaton people, however, are the genuine article, and all the more disturbing for it. I'd keep an eye on Mr de Quidt.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Philip Ardagh's Book of Absolutely Useless Lists for Absolutely Every Day of the Year is published by Macmillan.</p>",
  "<p>The hunt for \"unlikely\" book titles was originally suggested by publisher Bruce Robertson as a diversion for bored visitors to the Frankfurt Book Fair. For the uninitiated, Frankfurt is a kind of global clearing house for books, a soulless collection of giant sheds with hundreds of thousands of titles on display. Robertson hoped his wheeze would provide publishers with a moment's diversion while plodding the aisles. There were some hot contenders at that fair 30 years ago - 100 Years Of British Rail Catering, Cooking With God, and 50 New Poodle Grooming Styles. But there was a single standout title: Proceedings Of The Second International Workshop On Nude Mice, published by the University of Tokyo Press. The Diagram Prize was born.</p> <p>The Diagram Prize celebrates the oddest of these odd titles. Forget the Booker, the Nobel or the Pulitzer: real book lovers and the literati agree that the Diagram transcends them all. Every year entries flood in from around the world, starting a spell of frenzied voting.</p> <p>From the early days the procedures of the Diagram Prize appear to have been deliberately vague. Run by the Bookseller magazine's diarist, Horace Bent, a legendary book-trade figure, the winners seem to have been settled by an anonymous group, probably over port at a London club. Any type of book was admissible, the only restriction being that publishers were not allowed to submit their own books, to screen out intentional efforts at oddness. In 1993 submissions were opened beyond the confines of Frankfurt. And as publishing output spiralled there were rich pickings. When the major publishing corporations tried to squeeze any remaining oddness out of the industry, digital printing technology sprang up, enabling quirkier small publishers to produce books for niche interests.</p> <p>Browsing the lists of Diagram Prize winners and runners-up, it is clear that medical research has provided one of the richest seams over the years: A Pictorial Book Of Tongue Coatings, A Colour Atlas Of Posterior Chamber Implants, or Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Personal View. Being so obsessed with their narrow field of research, medical authors often seem to miss ambiguity. So Practical Infectious Diseases was presumably not a how-to guide to infecting your enemies, while the 2003 favourite Hot Topics In Urology sounds painfully relevant. </p> <p>Nature's glories have often been celebrated in book form. I imagine that there was an avid, if specialist, readership for Six-Legged Sex: The Erotic Lives Of Bugs, as well as Neurosis Induced Cannibalism In Antarctic Pigs (edited by Pigman Press). Farmers everywhere presumably flocked to bookshops to snap up a copy of The Potatoes Of Bolivia: Their Breeding Value And Evolutionary Relationships. That's if the Celtic ones weren't already busy reading (and perhaps road-testing) the very personal manual titled Sex Instructions For Irish Farmers.</p> <p>Every respectable household still has its fair share of \"how to\" and hobby books; perhaps your own shelves include Drying Flowers With A Microwave, or Waterproofing Your Child. You are less likely to have a copy of the rare 1989 Diagram winner, How To Shit In The Woods, which was aimed at people who needed instruction in this \"lost art\". And what gentlemen could live without the Braces Owner's Manual: A Guide To The Wearing And Care Of Braces, or the essential companion to facial hygiene that is Nasal Maintenance?</p> <p>The Diagram is unique, and perhaps uniquely blessed, in that spotters and judges alike do not actually have to read the books in question. Indeed, they are actively discouraged from doing so, in case a close knowledge of the subject makes them realise the book is less odd than it first appears. The imagination should be allowed to run wild. Why, we wonder, did the author need so many pages to explain the art of Big And Very Big Hole Drilling? Did the level of local interest really merit an entire tome about the question Did Lewis Carroll Visit Llandudno? Surely a simple yes or no would have sufficed.</p> <p>In one instance at least, this habit of using an entire book to tackle a single issue seems positively reckless. When the captain of your little pleasure cruiser spots a ferry hull looming over the horizon, do you really want him to reach for a copy of How To Avoid Huge Ships?</p> <p>Sometimes odd titles can uncover whole new worlds. Take Proceedings Of The Eighteenth International Seaweed Symposium. Who would have known that since 1973, scientists have been meeting regularly to discuss pressing developments in seaweed (the next Seaweed Symposium is scheduled for Mexico 2010). I wonder if the same commitment has been shown in other fields. Did Proceedings Of The Sixth International Fatigue Congress have any sequels, or did the participants all grow tired of the ritual?</p> <p>Winning the Diagram brings no immediate monetary reward for the author; instead it is the spotter of the title who receives a \"fairly passable\" bottle (usually claret). But most winning authors have been delighted at the accolade and the ensuing media attention. Such publicity can transform the profile of a title, lifting it from academic obscurity to the front of bookshops. The 2006 winner, The Stray Shopping Carts Of Eastern North America: A Guide To Field Identification, was displayed in stores across the world.</p> <p>It's easy to sneer at such a book. But oddness is in the eye of the beholder.

  "<p>Cricket, a game most Italians find baffling, is becoming one of the country's fastest-growing sports thanks to a wave of immigration from India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh. </p> <p>Around 20,000 people from the Indian subcontinent are regularly putting down stumps and padding up in Italy's parks, creating a groundswell of cricket which now sustains 33 teams in a three-division national league. </p> <p>In a summer punctuated by inflammatory anti-immigrant rhetoric from prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's ministers, a generation of foreign-born cricketers are now playing under the Italian flag to propel the national team to greater success. </p> <p>With a few hundred thousand people from the Indian subcontinent now in Italy, there are real quality players moving up from the parks into the league and national side, said Simone Gambino, an Italian who caught the cricket bug while visiting England in the 1970s and who now heads the Italian Cricket Federation. </p> <p>Local councils have begun to provide space for games, said Gambino. \"There are around 100,000 people from the subcontinent in the province of Brescia, and they want to play cricket, so the council had to provide pitches to stop people being struck by cricket balls.\"</p> <p>One player aiming to push Italy into the big league of cricket is Gayashan Munasinghe, 21, who starred in the side that beat rivals Netherlands in the European cricket championship in Dublin this summer. </p> <p>\"I struggled to fit in when I arrived but I am now proud to represent Italy,\" said Munasinghe, whose father, a Colombo policeman who emigrated five years ago, is now a pastry cook in Rome. </p> <p>Munasinghe qualified for Italy under rules allowing long-term foreign residents on to the side, and is now preparing for qualifying games in Tanzania for the cricket World Cup. But on spare Sundays he heads to an unused football pitch on the outskirts of Naples, paying \u20ac10 (\u00a38) to join scores of other Sri Lankan immigrants in fast and furious one-day competitions. The dozen or so six-man teams, which travel from as far as Milan, play knock-out matches of five overs in a party atmosphere for a team prize of \u20ac1,000. </p> <p>\"We get friends and family showing up and the odd curious Italian, while local Sri Lankan restaurants lay on fish and coconut curry,\" said organiser Manoj Sagara Wickramanayaka, 28, who works as a cleaner in Naples after emigrating from Sri Lanka nine years ago. </p> <p>Cricket made its first appearance in Italy in 1793, played by Nelson's sailors after they landed in Naples, before British traders set up the Genoa Cricket and Football Club in 1893, an organisation that soon dropped the cricket and now plays its football in the Serie A league. </p> <p>Expatriate embassy teams in Rome revived the game in the 1960s, with strict rules on the minimum number of Italians per team to help boost the game among the locals. </p> <p>To this day, Italy's top division requires a quota of Italians, which has helped homegrown players enter the national team, but two lower divisions are now allowed to field all-immigrant teams, which have formed along ethnic lines with names like Latina Lanka and Banglancona. The question is whether rising stars such as Munasinghe can win over a wider audience to the game. </p> <p>A few more victories at international level might help the situation, or at least improve its coverage, said Leandro Jayarajah, who plays with the Capannelle club in Rome. \"Satellite TV in Italy showed some cricket recently and Italian friends said, 'So is that the game you've been playing all this time?'\"</p>",
  "<p>Two weeks ago Dr Anne Guilding and her friends were relaxing in a restaurant, celebrating her son's wedding the day before. The food, wine and conversation were flowing. But then it suddenly turned ugly. No, there wasn't a bust-up between the in-laws. It was because one of the diners dared ask for some tap water so she could take a tablet.</p> <p>\"We had already spent hundreds of pounds, buying wine and expensive sparkling water. So I was gobsmacked when the waiter refused to bring us a jug of tap water, or even a glass. He told us it wasn't the restaurant's policy to serve tap water,\" says Guilding, whose party at the Brasserie El Prado in Bridgend included a member of the Welsh Assembly and a visiting American astonished that British restaurants don't automatically serve free water.</p> <p>\"I asked to speak to the manager, and explained that we had bought plenty of drinks and wanted some normal water. One member of the party needed to take medication and we did not consider asking for a jug of water unreasonable. He flatly refused to let us have any, reiterating that it was not the restaurant's policy.\"</p> <p>Guilding left the restaurant angry, embarrassed and humiliated. But ultimately the restaurant was the loser - the group decided not to leave a tip. The restaurant's owner, Jesus Decelas, says: \"Water costs us, the ice costs us, the lemon costs us. I have to charge.\" </p> <p>According to the National Consumer Council, Guilding's experience is depressingly common in Britain. Its research found that nine out of 10 restaurants fail to offer free tap water.</p> <p>A look at the Consumer Council for Water's website, where restaurant-goers can post reports of restaurant behaviour, reveals widespread anger and indignation about charging for tap water.</p> <p>One poster, \"Sharon\", says: \"When I was in Burger King recently, I started coughing and asked for some tap water. They refused even though I had tears running down my cheeks, as I struggled to stop coughing. They did offer to sell me a bottle of water; however, I decided to buy a coke instead as that was cheaper. Apparently, they don't 'do' tap water!\" Burger King told Guardian Money that the restaurant was wrong. It is company policy to provide customers with tap water on request.</p> <p>At a wedding in Birmingham, the hotel demanded \u00a35 per bottle of water placed on tables, and resisted fiercely when the couple asked for jugs of tap water instead. Pubs are named and shamed for charging as much as \u00a31 for a glass of tap water. Airports and railway stations are regularly cited as money-grabbers, removing free water fountains and effectively forcing travellers to buy bottled water at food outlets.</p> <p>Some restaurants even tell customers that water can't be provided for \"health and safety\" reasons.</p> <p>Dame Yve Buckland, chair of the Consumer Council for Water, says: \"As a country we have put \u00a370bn into the water industry. Tap water in Britain is now of the very highest quality and we urge restaurants to offer tap water to customers for free. You shouldn't have to feel like a cheapskate because you ask for tap water.\"</p> <p>But can you force a restaurant to give you free tap water? The tales on CCW's website (<a href=\"http://www.ccwater.org.uk\">ccwater.org.uk</a>) reveal widespread confusion over consumer law. </p> <p>Some tell of heated arguments in restaurants where diners insist that restaurants are required by law to provide free tap water. One says that under a law passed in Gladstone's time to promote temperance, restaurants are obliged to provide free tap water.</p> <p>Some in the trade believe that they are required to serve free water. \"As a retired hotelier and restaurateur, I was always led to believe that, by law, an innkeeper cannot refuse a traveller free water even if they do not spend any money at the establishment,\" says one poster on <a href=\"http://www.ccwater.org.uk\">ccwater.org.uk</a>.</p> <p>But these assertions are pure hokum. The truth is that in Britain there is no legal requirement on restaurants to provide free tap water to customers. Some pubs and other premises permitted to sell alcohol may have a clause in their licence that does require them to offer free tap water, but it's on a localised basis only.</p> <p>Sue Penniston, spokeswoman for the Drinking Water Inspectorate, part of Defra, says: \"There are a lot of misconceptions, some of which arose out of the Leah Betts case. In the wake of her death, a lot of large premises had clauses put into their licensing agreements which obliged them to offer tap water free of charge.</p> <p>\"But apart from that restriction, restaurants do not have to give you water and do not have to supply it for free.\" She adds that it's nonsense for establishments to refuse tap water on health and safety grounds. \"If a restaurant is on the public mains supply, the water is potable and there is no reason for it not to be supplied on health and safety grounds.\"</p> <p>In the absence of legal compulsion, Buckland is encouraging good practice among restaurant chains. Pizza Hut has said it will always give customers free tap water. Strada, a pizza chain, already serves customers free chilled tap water in a designer bottle. \"Strada is pleased to provide tap water free of charge throughout its restaurants as part of standard service,\" a spokeswoman says.</p> <p>Restaurants and retailers are also facing intense pressure from green campaigners. Earlier this year, environment minister Phil Woolas condemned the bottled water industry as \"morally unacceptable\". Mineral water suppliers on average use two litres of water for every litre put into a bottle. Much is transported from overseas, from as far away as New Zealand and Fiji. Four out of five bottles are plastic, most of which end up in landfill despite recycling initiatives, where it can take four centuries to decompose.</p> <p>Consumer campaigners Which? estimate that the number of plastic bottles sent to landfill each year would fill Wembley Stadium twice over. Which? describes bottled mineral water as an unnecessary drink that costs us \u00a31.68bn a year. The good news is that sales fell by 9% last year, and in the credit crunch sales are expected to fall further. \"Our reasons for buying bottled water are drying up,\" according to Which?</p> <p>United Utilities, one of the biggest UK water companies, has begun a campaign called \"tap into water\" that brings free tap water to events such as football matches and street festivals. Philip Green, UU chief executive says: \"At a time when we are facing such huge environmental challenges, buying bottled water at the rate of 3bn bottles a year in the UK is clearly unsustainable. I hope the hospitality industry will recognise their customers are environmentally aware and offer them free tap water without prejudice.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.collinson@theguardian.com\">p.collinson@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Phil Hill, who has died aged 81 following a long battle against Parkinsonism (a variant of Parkinson's disease), was the first of only two US drivers to win the world championship, achieving that distinction in 1961 driving for Ferrari, some 17 years before the Italian-born Mario Andretti won at the wheel of a Lotus.</p> <p>No driver before or since can have clinched the title in such traumatic circumstances. Hill did so by winning the Italian grand prix at Monza after a race in which his Ferrari team-mate Wolfgang von Trips, his only rival for the crown, was killed, along with more than a dozen spectators, following a horrifying collision with Jim Clark's Lotus.</p> <p>It was a profoundly shocking moment for Hill, who would come to be widely regarded as one of the most intelligent and deep-thinking drivers of his generation, and he subsequently seemed to wrestle within himself as to whether or not winning the world championship had been quite worth the effort in such emotionally fraught conditions.</p> <p>Hill was born in Miami, Florida, but brought up in Santa Monica, a leafy enclave of Los Angeles on the edge of the Pacific ocean. His father was a postmaster. He began racing in the late 1940s at the wheel of his own MG TC and, having dropped out of the University of Southern California business administration course, went to Coventry in 1949 as a trainee with the Jaguar company. He returned to California with one of Jaguar's sleek new XK120 sports cars, at the wheel of which he quickly gained a reputation as a man to watch in west coast national level races.</p> <p>His results caught the eye of wealthy Ferrari owner Allan Guiberson, who entered him in the 1952 Carrera Panamericana road race through Mexico. It was a wild and woolly affair in which he co-drove into sixth place. The following year he returned at the wheel of a 4.1-litre Ferrari, sharing with his friend and future formula one team-mate, Richie Ginther, but this outing ended spectacularly when they skidded (unhurt) off a cliff. </p> <p>Luigi Chinetti, Ferrari's importer for the US and owner of the North American Racing Team, then offered Hill several drives in his own cars before advising Enzo Ferrari that he should invite the Californian to drive at Le Mans for his factory team in 1956. Hill would enjoy considerable success in international sports car events and won Le Mans in 1958, 1961 and 1962, on all three occasions sharing the driving with the Belgian Olivier Gendebien. In his homeland, he won the Sebring 12-hour race in 1958, 1959 and 1961.</p> <p>Hill's formula one debut finally came in the 1958 French grand prix at Reims, where he drove a Maserati 250F hired from Swedish private entrant Jo Bonnier to finish seventh. Ferrari had been vacillating over whether or not to promote Hill to their grand prix squad, but this result in the French race had the effect of hurrying them up. He drove a formula two Ferrari in this \"second division\" class of the German grand prix, then moved up to formula one with the Maranello squad for the Italian and Moroccan races, helping team-mate Mike Hawthorn become the sport's first British world champion driver by waving him through to finish second behind Stirling Moss's race-winning Vanwall.</p> <p>In 1959 Hill remained a member of the Ferrari team, but it was not until the 1960 Italian grand prix that he scored the first of his three formula one victories, driving the Dino 246 to an easy win at Monza in a race boycotted by the British teams over the continued use of the bumpy banked section of the circuit.</p> <p>For 1961, Ferrari were well prepared for the new 1.5-litre formula one regulations which came into force at the start of the season. However, Ferrari's wilful reluctance to nominate a team leader meant that Hill, von Trips and Ginther spent much of the time racing each other, a draining experience for all concerned. Hill won the Belgian race at Spa-Francorchamps before experiencing that emotional roller coaster at Monza.</p> <p>\"When they told me the news that [von] Trips was dead, and more than a dozen spectators with him, I was stunned, deeply shocked,\" he said. \"The papers reported that I broke down and sobbed, but that was not true. When you've lived as close to death and danger as long as I have, then your emotional defences are equal to almost anything.\"</p> <p>Hill stayed with Ferrari in 1962, but the team was eclipsed by a new generation of challengers from the British Lotus and BRM teams. As far as formula one was concerned his career was in decline, and spells with the disastrously uncompetitive ATS and fading Cooper teams, in 1963 and 1964 respectively, heralded the twilight of this sensitive man's frontline racing career.</p> <p>He continued racing sports cars and rounded off the 1967 season with a fine win in the BOAC 1000km race at Brands Hatch, sharing the Chaparral 2K with Englishman Mike Spence. At the start of 1968, he suddenly realised that he had forgotten to renew his international competition licence. In his own words, he found that he \"had become a retired racing driver\".</p> <p>Hill returned to Santa Monica to a life of contentment, still living in the richly furnished Moorish-style house willed to him by his aunt in 1959. He married late, at the age of 44 in 1971, finding great happiness with divorcee Alma Varanowski, who had a young daughter, Jennifer. They had a daughter, Vanessa, and a son, Derek, who also tried his hand at motor racing in the 1990s.</p> <p>He is survived by Alma, his son and daughter, his stepdaughter and four grandchildren.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Philip Toll Hill Jr, racing driver, born April 20 1927; died August 28 2008</p>",
  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>Ros puts her hand over the receiver. \"She says she's not sure whether they take mums.\" Ros and I exchange quizzical looks. </p> <p>The woman from the campsite is back on the line. \"Sorry about that,\" she tells Ros, \"it's groups and gazebos we don't take. It's just that we have had trouble with mums before - we find that they sit around drinking coffee while their kids run wild.\" </p> <p>\"But isn't that the whole point?\" I say. Anyway, Ros secures the booking and we get on with our packing. We arrive and I smuggle my gazebo in, disguised as a play tent.</p> <p>Cartmel Caravan and Camping Park, perfectly manicured, in full bloom and boasting its very own microclimate, is an idyll in the lesser spotted southern Lake District. And the loos are clean.</p> <p>We pitch our tents and get the kettle on - did I make that sound too easy? - and the kids run wild. Actually, after a few excited laps of the field they decide to put on a talent show and begin practising. Over coffee we read the campsite rules. Organised games are not permitted and children must be kept under control at all times. We tell the kids to be less organised. They don't get it. We are definitely in control.</p> <p>Cartmel is not only famous for its splendid 12th-century priory and its racecourse, but is also home to the Sticky Toffee Pudding Co, one of Rick Stein's food heroes. We make this a priority excursion.</p> <p>The stroll into Cartmel is more than pleasant, with opportunities to play poohsticks on the bridge (built 1829), nip into the gallery to buy something to hang on your wall/neck, and for light refreshment in the heavily beamed Royal Oak. The village store turns out to be a gastronomic delight and we emerge with more than just sticky toffee pudding. The dads are arriving at the weekend - they are our excuse.</p> <p>Back to camp for coffee. The children want to play \"Harry Potter\" and ask if they can go into the wood to collect wands. We discuss wet day plans: steam train to the Lakeside aquarium; Holker Hall, with motor museum (optional extra) and lunch opportunity; a steam train to Lakeside, from Hatherthwaite, this time with steamer boat trip on to Bowness; if it keeps raining, I don't think the Beatrix Potter centre is too far away. The kids are now shouting wildly as cows are blocking their escape route.</p> <p>The kids return. They want me to be Professor McGonnigal. I'd prefer to do Defence against the Dark Arts but decide not to say anything. </p> <p>Dry day plans include ... well, it's so lovely here that I reckon there's a lot to be said for just sitting around in a field all day drinking coffee while the kids flourish in their new-found freedom. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Cartmel Caravan and Camping Park (01539 536270). </p> <p><strong>Melanie Horton</strong> has won two return flights to New York with STA Travel.</p> <h2>Keeping up appearances<br>Costa del Azahar, Spain</h2> <p>The first thing you notice about Camping Tropicana on the Costa del Azahar, before you get to grips with the nipple fountains and caged spider monkeys, is the extraordinary sense of order. The staff are all multilingual and flit from Spanish to French to English to German to Dutch, which can be a little tricky if you just want a token for the tumble drier. They also like rules: </p> <p>Rule 1. Stop and step away from the vehicle!</p> <p>(We have of course already stopped and are now studying a laminated site map and rule book.)</p> <p>Rule 2.

Select any three pitches from: yellow zone; blue zone; or green zone, unless marked with a white flag.</p> <p>(Okay, this is workable.)</p> <p>Rule 4. Pitches in the green zone bordered by a broken blue line can be selected only if: A. there are no free yellow zones or B. if marked with a white flag (see above).</p> <p>(Ah ...)</p> <p>Rule 5. If there are no free yellow, green or blue zones please select from a white zone (unless marked with a blue flag) in which case we are full!</p> <p>(Right ...)</p> <p>For us, Camping Tropicana is a pit-stop en route to Barcelona. For others it's an open air Ideal Home Exhibition. We are surrounded by elderly Dutch couples in caravans. Many, perhaps unaware that campsites tend to come with their own built-in floor, are busy laying linoleum. It seems tomorrow they are handing out rosettes for best turned-out pitch, with special awards for awning erection, tableware and light dusting beyond the call of duty. Competition's fierce: fridges to be hooked up, satellite dishes aligned, pot plants potashed, candelabras buffed. </p> <p>A priapic plaster of Paris Bacchus in the shower block notwithstanding, evenings are uneventful at Camping Playa Tropicana. At 8pm everyone retires inside to watch satellite TV and charge their mobiles. We too abandon the night time's meagre offerings to dust down our thermarests and prune the basil plant. I'm holding out for best newcomer on a limited budget. My wife feels the judges won't look kindly on open air pant drying.

We were enjoying a romantic beachfront dinner at the Season restaurant, when it slipped out: \"Let's go camping!\" I nearly choked on my pan-fried snapper. \"Trust me, you'll love it,\" he added. </p> <p>He said the same thing before he bought an Xbox. I ordered another bottle of Tasmanian pinot noir and changed the subject.</p> <p>The next day, with my Jimmy Choos protruding from my rucksack, we were on a Greyhound bus to Hervey Bay, launch pad of most excursions to Fraser Island. </p> <p>We opted for a three-day unguided group safari with Koala Adventures. In essence, we'd chosen to spend the next few days sharing camping equipment, food rations, and a four-wheel drive with a group of strangers.</p> <p>I nearly pulled out when we were shown the pre-trip safety video, which included tips on the quickest way to manoeuvre a jeep from a sand dune, what to do when confronted by a hungry wild dingo, and the crunch - the best way to dig a toilet in the sand. In the space of a day, I'd gone from private en suite to DIY toilet facilities. </p> <p>The Butchulla people - Fraser's original inhabitants - call the island K'gari, meaning paradise. It didn't take long to fathom why. We sped across empty beaches, swam in lakes and explored rainforests. At night we cooked and made merry beneath the stars. But what made the trip so special was our five fellow campers - a smorgasbord of nationalities, ages and characters. By the end of the trip we were like one big family, except we were happy and didn't want to part.</p> <p>After three days I was ready to leave. There's only so much dunny-digging a Sheila can take. At least my stilettos came in handy. <br><strong>Sarah Charsley, Brighton</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Koala Adventures (+61 7 4946 6446, <a href=\"http://www.koalaadventures.com\">koalaadventures.com</a>). </p> <h2>The other lake district<br>Uganda</h2> <p>Four hours west of Kampala is a small town called Fort Portal. The Bunyuruguru crater lake district is a half-hour drive away, on the back of a motorbike, by pick-up truck or squashed with 26 other people into a minibus that seats 12. </p> <p>Our first stop was Lake Nyabikere, where the CVK Hostel offers campsites or bandas (small roofed huts) with beds and mosquito nets from about \u00a33. The water is safe and refreshing to swim in, the bird life astoundingly varied and the weather hot but not oppressively so. You can hire a canoe to explore the lake itself, or hike through the hills on various walks with or without a guide.</p> <p>Lake Nkuruba is surrounded by tall trees. In an area with the highest primate density in the world, trees mean monkeys, lots of them. The babies swing from their mothers and look inquisitively at you from a few metres away. This theatre of nature is made all the sweeter by the knowledge that a few miles south people are being flown in to the national parks to pester the highly endangered mountain gorillas, for $500 an hour.</p> <p>The Bunyuruguru lake district is genuinely idyllic. Word is getting out though, leading to a proliferation of hotels although not yet visitors, so being the only guests in B&amp;Bs built for 60 people is a common and marvellous experience.<br><strong>Josh Heller, Sheffield</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>CVK Hostel (+256 7724 92274) </p> <h2>An American road trip<br>Rocky Mountain National Park</h2> <p>We've been road tripping for 10 days: living off restaurant gift-cards, free coffee and cool-box cream cheese. West from Kansas we headed straight to Vegas, dressed our best and drank dollar margaritas from plastic cups. Tonight, though, we push through dusk on cruise control and pitch our tent at Moraine Park campsite.</p> <p>Morning, and we're woken by the whir of generators and the low hum of breakfast. There's a friendly distance between campers, a quiet camaraderie born of bear fear and the short-term pleasure of communal living. When an old guy arrives with a truck full of wood and ice, we get in line and buy. </p> <p>In the afternoon it will rain so we jump into the car and make for the highest road. Everywhere signs plead that we stick to the path: \"Keep off the tundra!\" We canter higher, cameras in hand, gasping in the oxygen-lite air. Below us elk clump together. Black storms, hot from Kansas, stripe the horizon and threaten lightning. A ranger urges caution, but up here, where the trees grow sideways beside benevolent rocks, we believe ourselves untouchable and protected. </p> <p>In the evening we entertain ourselves by building a fire on our allotted grill. We bake potatoes and Olathe corn in foil, eat yellow mustard with our sausages and drop rum into our coke.

But Katherine is determined to make a special family visit to the malaria research station in rural Tanzania she ran with her late husband, Chris, in the 1950s. Tribes Travel is organising her trip and recommends staying at Babu's camp, in the Mkomazi game reserve in eastern Tanzania. </p> <p>The visitors' book at the main gate reveals that our party of eight are the only visitors in the entire reserve of 3,700 sq km. There are no signposts and little else to distract you from the rusty-red dust tracks, straw-coloured bush with green tufts of acacia and baobab trees, the purple-black Pare Mountains and the big skies.</p> <p>A walking safari in the intense equatorial heat with the camp manager, Seif, is fascinating. Animal tracks and droppings provide clues to the presence of giraffe, dik-dik and impala. There are 450 recorded species of birds in this area and, unlike in the bigger national parks, the larger animals are more reticent about performing for tourist cameras. We find an exquisite river frog in our loo, a hornbill calls at us from a nearby yellow-barked acacia tree, a giant brown moth sleeps in an empty whisky glass. </p> <p>Babu's is sensitive to its environment but retains an atmosphere of safari elegance. Pre-dinner drinks are selected from a temporary bar at the foot of a giant baobab tree and taken around a crackling campfire. Dinner itself is superb, particularly as there is no evidence of a kitchen or a chef. </p> <p>As Katherine recounts tales of taking blood samples from Masai warriors, we begin to get a feel for what it might have been like for her and Chris, more than 50 years ago, working in isolation in such a beautiful but forbidding wilderness.<br><strong>Stuart Heaver, Whitstable, Kent</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tribes Travel (01728 685 971, <a href=\"http://www.tribes.co.uk\">tribes.co.uk</a>).

That is the best thing about being a literature student. Despite bucketfuls of debt, our holiday plans can still be decided by a well-turned phrase. For me that phrase told of \"chicory-fragrant caf\u00e9 au lait\", sipped slowly by the sea meadows of France's Midi. I called my friend Dylan. \"We have to go to the south of France. I'm reading a book and it says there are women there with serene dark faces and smooth skin as sleek as seals.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not camping in France. I was 10 last time and the discos made me cry,\" he replied. \"No discos, I promise.\"</p> <p>Dylan's second clause was that we encounter mountains along the way, so we devised a route that would begin in Aquitaine, arcing through the Pyrenees and ending along the Canal du Midi in the Mediterranean fishing port of Agde. Flying into Bordeaux, we rented a car and drove south, the roads plunging us deep into the Gascogne regional park then taking us to the coastal village of Messanges, 70km north of Biarritz. </p> <p>We raised our tent that evening amid the sticky pines of the Landes forest, in a little disco-free campsite attached to the farm Chez Cazou. Our first night's sleep came easily after two flagons of Madame Cazou's ros\u00e9 wine. Days were spent wheeling blissfully through shady woods and grilling fat sardines on empty swaths of silver beach. </p> <p>From there, we wove our way south and into the heart-stopping crooks of the Pyrenees, arriving at our next campsite, Les Tilleuls, just outside the mountain village of G\u00e8dre. The surrounding views of the Campbiehl and Cirque de Galvanie were celestial. </p> <p>On we travelled, via the pink city of Toulouse, towards Agde. Stopping outside the local boatyard at Camping Periniere, we bought food at the market. A wondrous end to a holiday, until we decided one evening to take a swim at the naturist resort of Cap d'Agde. \"Come on, we've hiked the Pyrenees, this will be easy,\" I said, suddenly noticing the advanced age of our fellow bathers. \"Sleek as seals you said ... \" cried Dylan, drowned out by the disco behind us.<br><strong>Leo Wallace, York</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Chez Cazou (+33 5 58 48 50 47); Les Tilleuls (+ 33 5.62.92.48.92 ).</p> <h2>Rain won't stop play <br>New Forest, Hampshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337083101\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Camping2.jpg\" alt=\"Barbecuing in the New Forest rain\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another British summer... barbecuing in the New Forest rain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alison Miller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are smart campers. We consult the five-day weather forecast. Carefully. We are going to follow the sunshine route south to the New Forest. Two canny adults and five teenagers in a van, we nod our heads wisely and tap the sides of our noses at holiday traffic heading north.</p> <p>We are pitching our tent in Hollands Wood, a Forestry Commission site near Brockenhurst. It is raining unremitting sheets. I can see a stripy windbreak close by, behind which stands a man with a can of Strongbow and behind him is the Taj Mahal of all dome tents. Strongbow man is getting comfortable for our tent-raising entertainment. No one takes charge as we manically bend and pop the springy tent poles.</p> <p>We are awake under the dome and listening to the rain. It sounds like a riff: soft notes of wind through leaves, staccato pricks of rain, thudding crescendo, gradually quieter. </p> <p>On day two we hire bikes in Brockenhurst. The teenagers have reluctantly pulled on an assortment of waterproof gear, the smallest boys wearing man-size waterproof trousers that make their legs look short and pedalling tricky. On the forest trails we switch between easy inclines to free-wheeling downhill. There are tunnels of oaks, ash and beech. When the sky turns grey it contrasts with the lush, vibrant green all around us. </p> <p>Put this shade of green in a paint pot and you could call it August green or English green.

However, it was sunny and the Lizard Peninsula beckoned. Rolo could come too, camping being a canine-friendly option.</p> <p>I collected together tent, camping kitchen, air bed, pegs etc. Phil arrived with some very fine wines and a large quantity of paper napkins. And golf clubs. I remembered the whisky, matches and washing up bowl ... but omitted to bring wellies. </p> <p>We arrived at our campsite to be met by the cheerful owner who asked if I would like him to buy me some wellies in Redruth. I laughingly dismissed this kindness and asked for directions by foot to Kennack Sands. </p> <p>We had yet to make camp and I had a large tent and a rather large novice camper on my hands. However, Phil soon became childishly excited and tackled tent pegs and guide ropes with enthusiasm. The bed was inflated, table and chairs set out, tea made - and the monsoon commenced.</p> <p>We discovered the sanctuary of the Cadgwith Cove Inn and a magnificent fish stew washed down with Doom Bar bitter. The next morning Rolo and I set off to explore Ruan Minor, a hamlet of 25 houses, not to be confused with the metropolis of Ruan Major (50 houses). </p> <p>Cornwall did not disappoint - we were fortified by Annie's pasties and Gear Farm pizzas. A day of sunshine enabled Rolo and me to walk along the coastal footpath from the Lizard to Coverack, a distance of 11 miles. Phil covered a similar distance on Mullion golf course. And we celebrated our last night in gale-lashed Kernow with a sumptious feast cooked by Phil, on a gas burner, inside the tent, washed down with some of that rather fine wine. <br><strong>Hazel North, Portland, Dorset</strong></p> <h2>Mini-camping <br>Holland</h2> <p>Mini-camping is the perfect holiday for those who seek peace and relaxation rather than mass entertainment and structured activity. These small sites are usually on farms (boerderijcamping) or in large private gardens. </p> <p>At Op den Diesdonk near Eindhoven we camped at a small farm in flat, traffic-free cycling country. Cycle paths criss-cross through fields of maize, along well signposted networks. De Groote Peel national park is nearby. There was a playground for children, trampolines, and a field of ponies and horses next to the camp. </p> <p>Further north and east near the lovely market town of Oldenzaal we camped at Erve Molman mini-camp. The Scoholten family live in a gleaming new farmhouse and offer the old farmhouse as a sitting and dining room for campers. The charming old town of Ootmarsum is a 10km cycle away through deep woods and glorious countryside and we rode into Oldenzaal for the Monday market. </p> <p>Despite more than a thousand sites being listed in the Kamperen guide, available from VVV tourist offices and <a href=\"http://www.Vekabo.nl\">Vekabo.nl</a>, mini camping is a well-kept secret.

  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>The freak storm that flipped cars and flattened trees was not the most auspicious start to our three-day hike along Mallorca's new mountain path, La Ruta de Pedra en Sec (route of the dry-stone wall).</p> <p>\"You go upstairs?\" queried the barman in Soller.</p> <p>\"Upstairs?\"</p> <p>\"Into mountains?\" he said, looking at my climbing boots.</p> <p>A liberated sun umbrella tumbled by outside the rain-lashed window. \"Probably not,\" I replied.</p> <p>He nodded. \"Today downstairs. Tomorrow upstairs.\"</p> <p>Upstairs in Mallorca means the Tramuntana mountains, which jostle the Mediterranean for 90 jagged kilometres. The Consell de Mallorca (island council) has restored the old pilgrim path from Soller to the Sanctuary of Lluc, and is transforming a handful of old farmhouses into inexpensive refugios.</p> <p>The storm blew over. The following morning, we checked route and weather with Andy Mitter, the Anglo-Mallorcan guide we'd booked to lead us down the Torrent de Pareis gorge on our last day. And then the hike began. </p> <p>Mallorca's top storey is in a time warp. Gone is the tourist hubbub; a joyous silence prevails. Wild flowers scent the shaded path, blending with the whiff of donkey, goat and sheep. Generations of farmers have tamed the steep slopes with rock-buttressed terraces, planted with neatly coppiced olive trees. The path ducks under cliffs, past clear springs and dark caves, and crosses stream beds on ancient bridges. Higher up, the olive groves change to holm oak and pine and, when the bare limestone takes over, to fragrant Mediterranean scrub.</p> <p>After negotiating a via ferrata around an exposed gully, we trudged into the 540m-high Refugio Tossals Verd. Boots off and beer in hand, we sat outside and gazed at the mountains. Supper was a feast of chicken broth, pork casserole and fresh fruit, washed down with local wine.</p> <p>We rose early to scramble up the island's second highest peak, the 1,365m Puig de Massanella. Cloud engulfed us at the top, but not before we'd seen the island laid out like a schoolroom map. Far below, we spied the Sanctuary of Lluc, a medieval monastery with bedrooms, where pilgrims come to worship the Dark Lady, a 14th-century statue of the Madonna. That evening, I asked her for a storm-free scramble down the mighty Torrent de Pareis, where divine ire, in the form of flash floods, can carry off the unrepentant.</p> <p>The lady obviously has influence, as the sun rose in a cloudless sky. We met Andy, filled water bottles and headed downstairs. The valley gradually narrows until sheer 200m cliffs block out the sun. The route squeezes past giant water-smoothed boulders, across rocky ledges and past pools of cool, still water. Rock doves murmur and the occasional insect hums.</p> <p>The gorge finally widens into a stony floodplain of thigh-deep water. We waded through, and reached the cove of Sa Calobra. After a long, muscle-soothing swim, we boarded the ferry for the 40-minute trip back to Puerto Soller - and a seafood feast. Upstairs and downstairs, Mallorca's beautiful north coast has it all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"http://www.Tramuntanatours.com\">Tramuntanatours.com</a>. <br><strong><br>Mark Lunn</strong> from Petersfield has won a two-week campervan holiday for two in New Zealand with <a href=\"http://www.discover-the-world.co.uk/\">Discover the World</a> and <a href=\"http://www.airnewzealand.co.uk/\">Air New Zealand</a>.</p> <h2>Salt of the earth<br>Bolivia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337082698\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Train.jpg\" alt=\"Disused train in Bolivia\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Smith, right, in Bolivia with her sister Eileen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christine Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After making it through the strict Peruvian airport security (\"Do you definitely promise not to take out those scissors during the flight?\") and a 12-hour rollercoaster of a bus ride beside a slightly incontinent dog, I finally made it to Uyuni. I had planned to travel across the salt plains with the much recommended Colque Tours, but on arriving at the bus station I was distracted by Luiz Travel's promotion: for only US$10 extra, your driver's alcohol intake will be limited. On meeting the deaf 80-year-old Carlos who was to be our driver, chef and guide, I was pleasantly surprised: this was no boy racer.</p> <p>One hour later, and the change in scenery was breathtaking. Surrounded by 12,000km of perfect whiteness, we had reached the Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt lakes. Once an inland sea, the water has vanished over 15,000 years into the thin, dry air of Andean altitude. The only thing interrupting this huge expanse of nothingness is a small fish-shaped cacti-filled island. It's hard for the mind to take in. </p> <p>Woken the next day at 4am, I wondered what could merit such an early start now that we'd seen the Salar. However, scepticism was a distant memory as I excitedly ran towards the brilliant blue water surrounded by snow-capped red mountains and filled with hundreds of pink flamingos. Saturated with lead, sulphur and arsenic from the mountains, these lakes are startlingly white, blue, green and deep red. From the Salvador Dal\u00ed desert rock formations to the bubbling mudpools of the Sol de Ma\u00f1ana geysers, the landscape is alien and surreal. </p> <p>Bolivia is usually absent from the average tourist's wishlist and, as such, the infrastructure for tourism remains modest. However, sitting back in Uyuni in the aptly named Fun Bar, spit-fermented beer in one hand, llama pizza in the other, listening to a bowler-hatted grandma tell me how the salar was created from the breast milk of the volcano, this seemed just one more reason to come here.<br><strong>Christine Smith, Portstewart, Northern Ireland</strong></p> <h2>Pony trekking<br>Lesotho</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337082699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Adventure-3.jpg\" alt=\"Child in Lesotho\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lesotho, perfect for a 50th birthday party</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken Evans</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"Lesotho is not for sissies\" reads the sign at Sani Top, Africa's highest pub at around 10,000 feet, perched over the vertiginous pass from South Africa to Lesotho. What about us midlifers? We - my wife Sheila, and teenage sons - chose it for my 50th birthday, a trekking holiday with pack ponies.</p> <p>A boulder-pitted drive across a red plateau, watched by horsemen in brightly coloured blankets and balaclavas, leads to Molumong Lodge, our starting point. A roaring fire is made up in the large common room as we sit reading enthusiastic entries in the visitors' book. There's no electricity. We eat by candlelight with provisions we brought in. Sensational views of green ridges rippling away to the horizon more than compensate for the simplicity.</p> <p>The horse is the local 4x4, and Quality, our pack-pony, is our load-lugger. When he stumbles on a snowy ridge and falls to his front legs, it is touching to see the way our guide, Jacob, cuts steps into the ice with a stone and gently re-saddles him. We soon fall into that reflective, trekking rhythm of following four legs and a fly-swatting tail swishing through the scrub. The lavender perfume from the heather mingles with the musty smell of panting animal and the hoof-kicked, lip-coating dryness of dusty earth.</p> <p>At each village, Jacob negotiates lodgings, which are rapidly swept. As the dung fire brings tears to our eyes, we open the hut door to a swirl of clear-night stars. The villagers drop in to watch us stir pasta over a gas stove. Jacob tells us we are \"Lesotho TV\". Like them, I don't want to change channel.<br><strong>Ken Evans, Matlock </strong></p> <h2>Driving the Trans-Pamir Highway<br>Tajikistan</h2> <p>Abdul-Rachman looked like a man who'd seen hardships. At 72, he'd worked most of his life on a collective farm. When the Soviet Union collapsed, so did his livelihood. The mountainous Pamir region where he lives - the poorest part of the poorest former Soviet republic - then supported the losing side in Tajikistan's vicious civil war. The scars are as visible on the landscape as they are on his deeply lined face. The desolate mountain scenery along the Trans-Pamir highway is littered with burnt-out tanks. Landmine warning signs remind travellers in graphic detail what happens if they step off the narrow dirt-track. But the region is now picking itself up, dusting itself off and putting on a brave new face for tourists. It certainly has a lot to offer. </p> <p>The highway here snakes up and over 4,500m-high passes, and between spectacular snow-capped peaks. The locals have a sure-fire cure for altitude sickness - a swift shot of vodka followed by a whole clove of garlic so strong it leaves you blinking back tears. It certainly takes your mind off the headache. </p> <p>Generous hospitality to travellers is an ancient tradition among Pamiris. These days, encouraged by NGOs, it's turning into a business. But the industry has a long way to go. The Soviet-style army - complete with red star cap badges and Brezhnev-era belt buckles - has regular checkpoints to stop the opium trade from Afghanistan. To pass through you need cigarettes, alcohol and fistfuls of dollars. </p> <p>The Pamir mountains, like the Tajik republic, are still being formed. Hillsides look as if they could come crashing down at any minute. But as long as the political landscape remains stable, this journey is a fantastic adventure. \"Our time was the Soviet Union. It has passed,\" said Abdul-Rachman. Hopefully the future will prove him wrong.<br><strong>Tristan Kennedy, Oxford</strong></p> <h2>Piranha fishing<br>Brazil</h2> <p>\"Just chase them away,\" Laercio shouts from the car. We are on a little dirt road in the Brazilian Pantanal, and I have got out to open a cattle gate. But blocking it are half a dozen caiman alligators, basking in the sun. Seeing my hesitation, Laercio gets out of the car and shoos them away as if they are a lazy bunch of dogs. </p> <p>The world's largest wetland area, the Pantanal is a paradise for wildlife watching. Laercio, a photojournalist from nearby Cuiaba, and I are headed for the Pouso Alegre, a fazenda catering to ecotourists, offering walks and horseback riding. But you don't even need to leave the fazenda for the spectacle to unfold: flocks of yellow-faced parrots chatter noisily in the palm trees, a crab-eating fox snoops around for scraps. Still, I probably wouldn't have seen half of what I did without Judy, a cheerful local guide. She points out owls, monkeys, and tamanduas (a type of anteater) I would have walked straight past. David Attenboroughs are not made overnight. </p> <p>The next day we go piranha fishing. While Judy catches one after another, I manage only to feed the fish. That night though, Judy takes us on a boat safari, shining a strong torch at the riverbank. We chance upon a magnificent ocelot taking a drink. Blinded by the light, the cat stays frozen, when suddenly a piranha lands in the boat, flapping noisily and sending the two Dutch ladies in our group screaming. Instinctively, I grab the fish and throw it out - but the ocelot has disappeared. <br><strong>Ralph Paprzycki, Norwich </strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Pouso Alegre (<a href=\"http://www.pousalegre.com.br\">pousalegre.com.br</a>).</p> <h2>Into the void<br>Switzerland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337082700\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/Adventure2.jpg\" alt=\"Bungee jump in Switzerland\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getting ready to take the plunge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Ralis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Click. Off flew my email. Yes, I would very much like to plunge 220m off the Verzasca dam in Switzerland with a bungee cord tied to my leg. I would be arriving in late July and here were my bank details. I wonder if James Bond booked with the same company when he threw himself off the dam at the start of Goldeneye? </p> <p>I climbed for two hours, past Heidi mountain huts and Milka cows, wishing I could enjoy their beauty. Instead I felt like a convicted criminal, walking towards his fate. Suddenly, there it was through the trees - a monstrous grey cascade of concrete. </p> <p>Thirty minutes to go, and I could barely sign the consent form. In front of me was a British stag party, all wearing dresses, which lifted my spirits temporarily. </p> <p>\"First time jump, you?\" a bronzed technician asked me. \"Yep,\" I nodded. \"You virgin then, yes?\" he chuckled as he checked my harness and led me up the steps to the platform. As they shuffled me to the edge, I knew that the staff were talking to me, but I wasn't taking it in. Void, drop, space, terror. Don't think. Five seconds to go. Stare straight ahead. Like a bird. Three ... Two ... One ...</p> <p>Falling - fast! - 120km per hour, wind roaring, head throbbing with blood. All was a grey-green blur of terrifying exhilaration. Only when the bungee cord kicked in did the fear subside and the endorphins flow free. As I bounced up and down like a drunk trampolinist, I whooped unashamedly.

Our bush taxis - a sorry pair of decrepit Toyota Corollas - were no match for Cameroon's dirt roads. Our group was left with a two-hour walk over steep ground. On arrival at Kingomen, the confusion of shouts, whoops and hacking machetes emanating from the 10ft-high undergrowth almost persuaded us to turn back. </p> <p>We are on a two-week volunteering project organised by BTCV, the UK conservation charity, in partnership with Green Care, an environmental group based in northwest Cameroon. After two days of birdwatching and trekking, we're itching to start, replacing non-indigenous eucalyptus trees, which soak up groundwater, with local species that will protect the springs supplying the surrounding villages and farms.</p> <p>\"Pair up with a local and plant the trees in the holes they are digging,\" Gilbert Njodzeka, the unofficial leader of our group, instructs. \"And stay clear of the machetes.\" In less than two hours we plant nearly 500 trees. </p> <p>To celebrate our visit, the women of Kingomen have prepared a lunch. As we feast on njamma jamma (a tasty local dish made from huckleberry) and fufu (a less tasty maize flour porridge), Justin Ngiuzun, a Green Care member, urges the village women to take responsibility for the newly planted catchment. This is a progressive move in a region where men are traditionally in charge of land and village politics. The women agree; they would have done most of the work anyway, they argue.</p> <p>The locally brewed palm wine and \"33\" beer come out, and it's clear that tree planting was just the warm-up - the real fun starts now. Bands begin to play in the village square, which is soon alive with the sound of drums, singing and laughter. Luckily, Cameroonian dancing is easy to pick up - a simple foot shuffle seems to work for all music. More challenging moves are introduced with each cup of wine. Hopefully some of the trees we planted were palms, to ensure a plentiful supply of wine for future planting days in Kingomen.<br><strong>Tim Woods, Brighton</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>BTCV (01302 388883, <a href=\"http://www.2.btcv.org.uk\">2.btcv.org.uk</a>). </p> <h2>Kollam elephant festival<br>Kerala</h2> <p>On the red earth, huge bamboo structures are being erected, bicycle stalls of all kinds set up, young orange-robed mahouts eat ice-creams, immaculate policemen lazily swing lathis and hundreds of glittering parasols are lined up against long barriers. I'm directed to stand below the \"Welcome Foreigners!\" pavilion, occupied by Europeans, sunburnt arms and breasts bulging out of strappy tops. </p> <p>Three groups of 12 caparisoned elephants sway into view, lining up. Everywhere is seething with hundreds of oiled black heads and balloons. </p> <p>Four small mahouts climb on to each elephant. Parasols are passed up and displayed to the elephants opposite, whose mahouts raise more elaborate and impressive ones. Our group exchange theirs for fancier parasols. The opposite side raises its stakes. The crowd thickens. Brahmini kites wheel overhead. We have been there for three scorching hours, and parasols are still being hoisted in ritual rotation. </p> <p>Darkness falls and crazy bamboo towers light up.

Come summer, it's accessible to less hardcore adventurers - although so far the only foreigner I've met is a Danish student staying in the igloo next to mine at the Hotel Arctic in this little town inhabited by 4,500 people and 4,000 sled dogs.</p> <p>There are reindeer and musk ox in Ilulissat, too, among the houses painted red, blue, yellow and green. Husky dogs lounge on patches of grass; drying fish hang, bunting-like, in neat rows on tall wooden racks. Traffic signs warn of oncoming sledges. The supermarket sells 27 types of fish and three varieties of whale blubber. </p> <p>Later, a fisherman sails me into the fjord on a small red boat. In the flat Arctic light, the icebergs are sheer walls of ice soaring towards the polar sky. We sail among them like a toy boat in a giants' world.

But this one, my brother's, wasn't in an 18th-century church in Hertfordshire and wouldn't cost \u00a320k. This one was in Siberia. </p> <p>Once voted \"person least likely to leave the UK\", I'd exceeded all my family's expectations (and my own), and made the epic journey by plane, train and rickety bus to a village in deepest, darkest Siberia. Except in July, it wasn't very dark. A grid of wide, dusty roads lined with wooden houses, communist-era flats, and a small batch of shops, Yermakovskoe was baking in heat you imagine only belongs to Greece. </p> <p>Due to an influx of German hikers, the only hotel had failed to honour my booking - and that of the other 18 wedding guests. Members of the Russian contingent of my soon-to-be family rallied around, and rooms, spare mattresses and even a free flat were drummed up. Samagonka - a potent homebrew that singed the tonsils - was distributed. The party began. </p> <p>Between trips to the Sayan mountains, barbecues, saunas in local banyas and the scratching of huge insect bites, was the wedding. It made Russian TV, the newspapers and even drew the region's mayor to speak about Britain and Russia's great relations. Vodka was downed, a traditional choir sang and we toured the village in Lada taxis. </p> <p>Then my brother lost his wedding ring swimming in the river. Not quite the obvious happy ending I was after.<br><strong>Amy Rich, Ampthill, Bedfordshire</strong></p>",
  "<p>The Cairngorm mountains of north-east Scotland are Britain's Arctic. In winter, storm winds of up to 170mph rasp the upper shires of the range, and avalanches scour its lee slopes. Even in summer, snow lies in the deeper corries of the massif, sintering slowly into ice. The aurora borealis can be seen from its summits - billowing curtains of green or, more rarely, red light. In places, the wind blows so insistently that pine trees grow to just a few inches high, spreading across the ground in densely woven dwarf forests. It is a terrain shaped by what Nan Shepherd, in her masterpiece about the region, called \"the elementals\".</p> <p>Shepherd was born in Aberdeen in 1893 and died there in 1981, and during her long life she spent hundreds of days and covered thousands of miles exploring the Cairngorms on foot. Her reputation rests on the three modernist novels she published between 1928 and 1933 (The Quarry Wood, The Weatherhouse, A Pass in the Grampians), but to my mind her most important work is her least known - an 80-page prose meditation called The Living Mountain. Shepherd, who worked as a teacher for most of her life, wrote the book during the last years of the second world war and the first years of its aftermath. She then put the manuscript in a drawer for three decades, until finally she consented to its publication in 1977. It is now almost forgotten, kept admirably in print by Canongate, its admirers fierce but few. Given the current surge of interest in the literature of nature and place, however, it's a book that might - should - attract a new generation of readers.</p> <p>The Living Mountain is a difficult work to describe. A celebratory prose-poem? A geo-poetic quest? A philosophical inquiry into the nature of knowledge? None of these quite fits, though it is all of them in part. Shepherd herself called it \"a traffic of love\", with \"traffic\" implying \"exchange\" and \"mutuality\" rather than \"congestion\" or \"blockage\". Its prose is weathered in both senses: filled with different kinds of climate, but also the result of decades of contact with \"the elementals\". It is about the Cairngorms in the same way that Ulysses is about Dublin, or Mrs Dalloway is about London - which is to say, it is attentive to the specifics of its chosen landscape, but also passionately metaphysical. </p> <p>The book is in 12 sections, each of which explores an aspect of the Cairngorms and life on them: \"Water, Frost and Snow\", \"The Recesses\", \"The Senses\", \"Man\", \"Being\". Reading the book, you realise that these apparently separate sections are bound laterally to each other by rhymes of colour, thought and word, so that they form a transverse weave. In this way, too, the book's form acts out its central proposition, which is that the world will not fall into divisible realms, as an apple may be sliced, but is instead a meshwork of interrelations. \"So there I lie on the plateau,\" writes Shepherd. </p> <p>\"under me the central core of fire from which was thrust this grumbling grinding mass of plutonic rock, over me blue air, and between the fire of the rock and the fire of the sun, scree, soil and water, moss, grass, flower and tree, insect, bird and beast, wind, rain and snow - the total mountain.\"</p> <p>\"And\" is one of Shepherd's favourite words in The Living Mountain, being the conjunction that implies connection without hierarchy.</p> <p>Most works of mountain literature are written by men, and most male mountaineers are focused on the goal of the summit. Shepherd, however, goes into the Cairngorms aimlessly, \"merely to be with the mountain as one visits a friend, with no intention but to be with him\". \"I am on the plateau again, having gone round it like a dog in circles to see if it is a good place,\" she begins one section, \"I think it is, and I am to stay up here for a while.\"</p> <p>The Living Mountain is worth reading for its observational acuity alone. It is thick with the kinds of perception that come only from \"staying up for a while\"; from the repeated idle traversals of a landscape: \"Birch needs rain to release its odour. It is a scent with body to it, fruity like old brandy, and on a wet warm day one can be as good as drunk with it.\" Shepherd notices and records \"the coil over coil\" of a golden eagle's ascent on a thermal, \"the immature scarlet cups of the lichen\", the starry saxifrage and \"the white-winged ptarmigan\". She spends an October night in air that is \"bland as silk\", and while half-asleep feels herself become stone-like, \"rooted far down into immobility\". She notes how a river's currents can weave floating pine needles into balls, similar to wrens' nests: structures so intertwined that \"they can be lifted out of the water and kept for years, a botanical puzzle to those who have not been told the secret of their formation\". (These pine-needle balls are also surreptitious emblems of Shepherd's own tightly knit and tiny work, itself \"kept for years\".) </p> <p>Shepherd is a fierce looker, then. And like many fierce lookers, she is also a mystic, for whom empiricism is the first step to immanence. Her descriptions always move beyond the merely material. Up on the mountain, she writes, \"the eye sees what it didn't see before, or sees in a new way what it had already seen. So the ear, the other senses. These moments come unpredictably, yet governed, it would seem, by a law whose working is dimly understood.\" Like her friend and fellow modernist novelist Neil Gunn, and like the Scottish explorer-essayist WH Murray, Shepherd had read deeply in Buddhism. Shards of Zen philosophy glitter in the prose of all three writers, like mica flecks in granite. Reading their work now - with the fusion of Scottish culture and Buddhist metaphysics - remains astonishing: like seeing a Noh play performed in a kailyard, or chrysanthemums flourishing in a corrie. </p> <p>\"A mountain,\" writes Shepherd Zennishly, \"has an inside.\" It is a correct but counterintuitive proposition, for we tend to think of mountains in terms of their exteriors - peaks, plateaus, cliffs. But Shepherd is always looking inside the Cairngorm landscape. Again and again her eyes pry through surface: into cracks in rocks, into the luminous interior of lochs or rivers. \"Into\", in The Living Mountain, is a preposition that gains, through repeated use, the power of a verb. Shepherd is also fascinated by mirages of the mountain-world, the illusions that can be brought on by snow, mist, cloud or distance. She punningly calls these illusions \"misspellings\", visual errors that possess an accidental magic.</p> <p>In one memorable passage, Shepherd describes looking at a croft during a rain shower. The wet air acts as a lens, multiplying and redistributing her sightlines, so that she seems to view all sides of the barn simultaneously. Shepherd's own style possesses a similar stereoscopic quality. Reading The Living Mountain, you experience a curious visual dissonance. Your sight feels . . . scattered, as though you've suddenly gained the compound eye of a dragonfly. This effect is created by her refusal to privilege a single perspective. The prose watches now from the point of view of the eagle, now from that of the walker, now from that of the creeping juniper. In this way we are brought to see the earth \"as the earth must see itself\". </p> <p>\"That's the way to see the world, in our own bodies,\" wrote the poet, Buddhist and forester Gary Snyder, and his words could stand as an epigraph to The Living Mountain. For Shepherd, being outdoors is a profoundly sensuous experience: \"I am like a dog - smells excite me. The earthy smell of moss . . . is best savoured by grubbing.\" She lives off wild food, eating cranberries, cloudberries, blaeberries, drinking from the \"strong white\" water of rivers. She swims in lochs, and sleeps on hillsides, to be woken by the sharp press of a robin's claw upon her bare arm or the snuffle of a grazing deer. She records with brilliant exactness how frost \"stiffens the muscles of the chin\" (a part of the body we don't usually associate with muscularity, let alone thermometric sensitivity), or the pleasure of \"running my hand after rain through juniper . . . for the joy of the wet drops trickling over the palm\". For Shepherd, though, this sensuous relish was not an antagonist of thought, but its accomplice. In the mountains, she writes, \"the body may be said to think\". </p> <p>This is her book's most radical proposition. Radical, because Shepherd was a woman writing out of a Highland Scottish culture in which the cherishing of the body was not easily discussed. And radical because, as philosophy, it was cutting-edge. In the same years that Shepherd composed The Living Mountain, the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty developed his influential theory of the body-subject. For Merleau-Ponty, post-Cartesian philosophy had fallaciously divided body and mind. He argued instead that we are continually \"embedded\" in the \"flesh\" of the world: that we experience a constant exchange or \"traffic\" with our environment in ways that both exceed and inform our rational, intentional mind. His work, particularly The Phenomenology of Perception (1945), was dedicated to enriching the idea of the body, such that it could be said both to perceive and to think. Merleau-Ponty described this embodied experience as \"knowledge in the hands\", a phrase that could have come straight from Shepherd. \"The body is not . . . negligible,\" she wrote, \"but paramount\".</p> <p>\"The hands have an infinity of pleasure in them. The feel of things, textures, surfaces, rough things like cones and bark, smooth things like stalks and feathers and pebbles rounded by water, the teasing of gossamers . . . the scratchiness of lichen, the warmth of the sun, the sting of hail, the blunt blow of tumbling water, the flow of wind - nothing that I can touch or that touches me but has its own identity for the hand as much as for the eye.\"</p> <p>It's Shepherd's belief in what might be called \"bodily thinking\" that gives The Living Mountain its contemporary relevance. For more and more of us experience less and less contact with the world. We have come increasingly to forget that our minds are shaped by the bodily experience of being in the world - its spaces, textures, sounds, smells and habits - as well as by genetic traits we inherit and ideologies we absorb. We are, literally, losing touch. Shepherd saw this loss beginning more than 60 years ago, and her book both mourns it and warns against it: \"This is the innocence we have lost,\" she observes, \"living in one sense at a time to live all the way through.\" Her book is a wry, beautiful hymn to \"living all the way through\".</p> <p>And walking, for Shepherd, is the best way to \"live through\". On foot for hour after hour, you \"walk the flesh transparent\". \"On the mountain,\" she remarks in the book's closing sentences, \"I am beyond desire. It is not ecstasy . . . I am not out of myself, but in myself. I am. That is the final grace accorded from the mountain.\" This is Shepherd's version of Descartes's cogito - I walk therefore I am. She celebrates the metaphysical rhythm of the pedestrian, the iamb of the \"I am\", the beat of the placed and lifted foot.</p>",
  "<p>This is my debut column this season on account of the Olympics, which seemed to be a success, everyone seems chipper about the achievements of cyclists, yachtsmen and what not - and why not? If it makes people jolly then get on with it, I say. A teacher once said to me \"a lot of you boys like to take cocaine because it makes you feel jolly\" - it was simultaneously the most modern and old-fashioned thing I'd ever heard anyone say, its Blyton-esque vernacular coupled with a tacit endorsement of drug use was as barmily jarring as a krunk-fuelled orgy held at the tea rooms of the Caf\u00e9 Royale.</p> <p>I mistrust the Olympics, believing it to be the Blue Peter of world sport, a medicinal spectacular, a big pyrotechnic barn dance for squares. That said I regard with awe anyone who can master any physical pursuit; just yesterday I journeyed for seven minutes on a \"cross-trainer\" before someone kindly pointed out that I was ambulating backwards - literally going nowhere fast. Actually it wasn't even that fast. And it asks your weight and age before it lets you have a go. Naturally I lied to it, the cross-trainer currently believes I am a 22-year-old ice-skater trying to lose a few pounds off her sweet tush - it's gonna kill me when it finds out the terrible truth.</p> <p>Football, a sport at which I am also rubbish, I can at least enjoy watching without the suspicion that it's trying to teach me something about \"community\" or \"trying\". In a way it is an utterly amoral game, except for when an opposing team returns possession after the ball has been kicked out for an injured player to receive treatment or when Paolo Di Canio eschewed a scoring opportunity rather than put the ball past felled Everton keeper Paul Gerrard.</p> <p>Or when in the 70s at Anfield a mounted policeman tumbled from his steed and a fellow officer helped him on to his own saddle causing the Kop to reprise Rolf Harris' hit \"Two Little Boys\" - \"Did you think I'd leave you lying when there's room on my horse for two...\"</p> <p>Aside from these isolated phenomena the game is entirely governed by sponsorship, agents and roasting - of course it is. How could our national game not reflect our national character? They say societies get the government they deserve and perhaps we get the sport we deserve too; and as a West Ham fan that is a troubling idea. The club seems to be in some turmoil and it appears there is division between manager Alan Curbishley and the board. Not least one suspects as a result of the growing trend in top-flight football for superscouts, at West Ham there is a fella called Gianluca Nani who is tasked with finding and recruiting new players for the team. Now whether he works in conjunction with the incrementally castrated Curbishley or not it's easy to envisage how such a relationship could cause tension. </p> <p>The other week Nani, whose official title is \"technical director\" (need any techniques directed? Ooh, yes please, they're all over the shop) brought in the Chilean striker Sebasti\u00e1n Pinto on loan from the Brazilian side Santos and Curbishley refused to play him in a friendly against QPR that took place \"behind closed doors\". There's a few things in this story worthy of note; firstly the whole \"on loan\" concept is bizarre, in a transient world such as ours everything is impermanent, the planet itself will one day implode so the notion of an eternal transfer is berserk.</p> <p>Also borrowing people is perhaps more quirky than buying them - \"oy, mister can I borrow your wife?\" sounds macabre, as does \"give us a go on your girlfriend Russ\" which is what the video man used to shout when he'd pull up his van outside ours. I never let him of course, in spite of his pledge to give me the Star Wars trilogy free for one week as recompense. I'd already seen it and those videos were moody, plus Tracy was a schoolgirl.</p> <p>And what kind of pervy Aleister Crowley football matches have to be played behind closed doors? What do they get up to in these clandestine contests? Play in the nude? Worship the devil? It's difficult to imagine them doing anything more embarrassing than the performance they turned out so publicly and brazenly at Manchester City last Saturday. If that game had been conducted in private I wouldn't now be harbouring the spectacle of Luis Boa Morte guiltily scampering like a fare evader on an InterCity train.</p> <p>Most troubling though is the innate structural difficulty that the position of technical director brings. Kevin Keegan at Newcastle has to play with the hand dealt to him by his own technical director Dennis Wise. One of the myriad problems with school was packed lunch, I never knew what I was having till the Tupperware was prised open and the day's selection revealed. </p> <p>I never would've selected a first team comprising a jam sandwich, a wagon wheel and a packet of Wotsits but that was what I had to contend with because those decisions were made above my head. Why? Because I simply couldn't be trusted to pick my own lunch as I was a nitwit child. At least my diet was constructed by my mum, who I know loves me, and not Dennis Wise, whose intentions towards me remain unclear.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:russell.brand@theguardian.com\"><br>russell.brand@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>I surrendered, but the battle raged on</h2> <p><strong>In May I decided to cash in our Standard Life endowment so I could reduce our mortgage and change to a repayment. Surrenda-link came up with the best quote - \u00a321,500 against a \u00a320,107 surrender at Standard life. </strong></p> <p><strong>I was told it would take six to eight weeks for the process to be completed.</strong></p> <p><strong>But two weeks ago I was told the offer had been withdrawn as my policy was one with a\" maturity option plan\". Now, not only have I lost the Surrenda-link deal but the Standard Life surrender value has fallen so I have lost out again. And I lose for a third time as my replacement mortgage may be pricier. Please help </strong></p> <p><strong>BE, Merseyside </strong></p> <p>\"Maturity option plans\" were virtually the monopoly of Standard Life - once this policy had run for half its set number of years it could be surrendered without penalty. As a result, these plans are of no interest to traded endowment dealers because they cannot sell them on at a profit as the true value is already reflected in the Standard Life offer price. </p> <p>But no one noticed this rare policy type - Surrenda-link admits it missed it due to human error. And you could hardly have been expected to know: if you had been so clued up on endowment types, you probably would have avoided these policies altogether. </p> <p>Yours will fall short of the required amount to pay off the home loan. It was not until August that Surrenda-link noticed this and told you the policy would not be purchased. But by then, Standard Life had cut bonus rates, reducing your potential policy proceeds further. </p> <p>Surrenda-link was helpful when Capital Letters called. It accepts that it should have spotted the early maturity option at the first instance. It will put you back in the position you would have been had you surrendered directly to Standard Life with a \u00a3752 cheque to cover the reduction in value earlier this month. It will also send you \u00a3250 compensation for the inconvenience you suffered.</p> <h2>Making allowances for the bride</h2> <p><strong>I booked a return flight for my September wedding in Greece via Travel Republic in January. After many conversations and letters the travel agent finally confirmed a 20kg baggage allowance - I will need several changes of clothes so this was important to me. I was delighted when the XL airline also offered me an extra 10kg because of my bridal status.</strong></p> <p><strong>But then it started to unravel. In July Travel Republic changed our return flight from XL to Thomas Cook, which had a 15kg luggage allowance. Each extra 5kg would cost \u00a335. Is it fair I should have to pay this?</strong></p> <p><strong>NF, London </strong></p> <p>You bought into Travel Republic and XL flights because of a generous luggage allowance. You expected the same in both directions - if you had known about this initially you would have booked elsewhere. Flights can alter - but a bill of \u00a3140 for the return trip is hardly a good start to married life. </p> <p>Travel Republic acted swiftly when Capital Letters intervened, however. It has arranged the higher baggage allowance you asked for, offered you 10% off your next booking - and it will send you a bottle of champagne as well.</p> <h2>Why Reiss deserves a dressing down</h2> <p><strong>I bought a silk dress at Reiss in its sale last month for \u00a338.70. It seemed a bargain. But when I unwrapped it at home a week later I noticed several tiny holes down the front. I hadn't cut the label off (and obviously hadn't worn it). I took it back within Reiss's 14-day returns period, asking for a refund as the garment was unwearable.</strong></p> <p><strong>I was offered an exchange or a credit but, as I wanted a refund, the dress had to be sent off to customer services. I heard nothing for 10 days, so I phoned the shop which told me it was not a manufacturing fault and Reiss refused a refund. And now it has gone back on the credit or exchange. Please help. </strong></p> <p><strong>JK, London </strong></p> <p>Your rights here are the same as with full priced items - if they are not of merchantable quality you are entitled to a cash refund unless the fault was pointed out when you bought.</p> <p>You were asked why you had \"left it so long\" before returning the garment but one week is hardly a long time.</p> <p>Consumer Direct told you were entitled to a replacement, repair or refund at your choice under the Sales of Goods Act 1979. This apparently cut little ice with Reiss, which argued it was not a manufacturing fault. That may be so, but the holes made the dress useless. </p> <p>Capital Letters then argued these points to several people at Reiss. The frock retailer did not tell this column of the outcome of this intervention but it did finally agree to return your cash. It made you visit the shop and has not paid compensation for your time, or phone calls. You say you will never shop there again.</p> <h2>Recovery rooms: names to remember</h2> <p><strong>Last week, you mentioned former Pacific Continental customers being contacted by \"recovery rooms\" offering to get back the money they lost on shares the bust broker sold. I noticed </strong><strong>you did not name any in your article. Can you say who to avoid? </strong></p> <p><strong>RL, Belfast</strong></p> <p>The list is long, changing, and, of course, incomplete. But here are some of the names. Conquest Mergers (gives a Tokyo address), Bluehill Venture Capital (on the Swedish warning list), Crest Asset Management (a Singapore address and on the New Zealand list), Omega Capital Management (a Kuala Lumpur address and appears on the FSA warning list), Westcomb Capital Management (on the FSA warning list), and Summit Mergers and Acquisitions (a New York post box and on several warning lists). None of the above are related to legitimate companies in the UK and US of similar name.</p> <h2>How HSBC made a mess of an Isa switch</h2> <p><strong>In April my mother tried to transfer her HSBC cash Isa into a stocks and shares Isa with Cofunds. All the correct papers were sent but HSBC denied the Isa existed and continued to do so even though we sent all the details several times. Instead, the bank focused on her First Direct cash Isa, which is quite separate and was not intended to be tranferred at all. This went on for three months.</strong></p> <p><strong>Eventually, despite all the denials, HSBC finally transferred the lost cash Isa in late July. My mother is elderly and has been very frustrated by all this. What is going on? </strong></p> <p><strong>LK, Norfolk </strong></p> <p>It is not surprising your mother, used to a more traditional form of banking, was left speechless by the bank's refusal to acknowledge her cash Isa holdings.</p> <p>What happened is that the bank's processing centre, in Coventry, received a letter in late April from Cofunds requesting a transfer of her cash Isa - new rules in place since April now allow a switch from cash to stocks and shares but not vice versa. </p> <p>When attempting to match this letter from your mother to its records, the bank incorrectly forwarded the instruction to First Direct, which is part of HSBC. First Direct did not know (why should it) of the HSBC Isas, so all it could do was to offer to transfer that particular cash Isa. </p> <p>It's a mess, like so many Isa transfers this year. HSBC acknowledges its errors and will write to apologise to your mother for the frustration and inconvenience she experienced, together with a bouquet of flowers. </p> <p>The silver lining here, however, is that the stock market has fallen substantially since April so her equity unit trust purchases will be better value - she has not lost out financially.</p> <p><strong>Contact</strong> We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

As, in fact, is the top of the stairway down to the toilet, with a Tracey Emin neon tube glowing with the words \"Fucking beautiful\". It is reversed, though, so you have to view it in one of the restaurant's mirrors to get the full effect.</p> <p>Away from the art, Hix Oyster &amp; Chop House is decked out with plain quality: wooden surfaces, clean tiling, copper pans and starched whites. But, like the bums and the Emin, Mark Hix's first eponymous restaurant is straight-talking, reflecting his passion for quality English fare treated with care but not fuss. Menu entries list dishes with a maximum of three ingredients, and there is no need for decoding. When it says the broad beans are \"crushed\", that's what they are - just smacked on the head, not pur\u00e9ed or delivered in a pipette. Nine of the 16 main courses are beef, with seven different cuts, spread between Dexter and Aberdeen Angus.</p> <p>There are some foods I am just not prepared to dislike. Parsnip slips past my guard now and then, but olives gave way relatively easily after a force-feeding regime, and I was relieved, about five years ago, and after detailed research into the workings of my gag reflex, to start properly enjoying oysters. Any food that can automatically change sex during its lifetime has to be eaten.</p> <p>I like oysters creamy, and decide on a couple as a pre-starter starter. Our waiter accurately predicts that I will like the Cumbrae and Maldon. Like all the bits of advice and knowledge he has, such as how Hix cures his salmon in his back garden, it is delivered with the perfect level of smarminess and ceremony, ie none. </p> <p>A hot miniature sourdough loaf arrives, then the oysters and a bowl of peas in the pod - another pre-starter nibble we somehow thought would be a good idea. Oysters full and creamy; peas in generous quantities, so you could abandon the inevitable duds.</p> <p>We start with Hix's own smoked salmon cure and the red mullet with crushed broad beans on toasted sourdough. The salmon, blood orange-deep in colour, is boldly smoked, but that fire doesn't hang around in your face. It just melts away with the flesh. There's a dryness to the crushed broad beans, which make a slightly claggy combination with the sourdough and mullet, but it's tasty.</p> <p>As soon as the beef flank and oyster pie comes, I realise I am heading for metabolic disaster. I have never had this dish, but what with my recent bivalve excitement, it just seems the right thing to do and the right place to do it. To my horror, I learn that I don't really like cooked oysters, despite the dark, grainy loveliness of the beef in its gelatinous gravy and shortcrust pastry, which is suety but not leaden. </p> <p>I can just remember two things before slipping into a food coma: 1) the chips were a really good size (not pencils, not bricks) and 2) the whole John Dory with rosemary was good enough to make my girlfriend loosen her evangelical grip on Anthony Bourdain's \"no fish on Monday\" rule.</p> <p>Bursts of sharpness and perfume bring me round like smelling salts. The jelly in the perry jelly and elderflower ice-cream is so flawless, it resembles a lens. You could use it as a kind of wobbly magnifying glass. </p> <p>The other thing that wakes us is the crash of glass at the top of the stairs leading from the kitchen. They've got a new Olympic sport here: climbing with a massive tray of hot pies and then having to navigate a tricky right-hand bend with a pillar threatening to take you out. It's entertaining, but go soon or the excellent staff will have it sussed.</p> <p>Three weeks later, having digested that meal, I go back. This strategy has risks: you can't fault further research, but which side to come down on if the experience is totally different from the first visit? </p> <p>Never mind - I have to test a main course I would ordinarily love. In this case it is the hanger steak (not a common cut, but it has great livery flavour) with baked bone marrow, chips and salad. From the charring to the bleeding heart, it is superb, and the marrow - a bone halved lengthwise and topped with breadcrumbs, parsley and garlic - is a royal treat. Only a main course this time, with chips and salad, but I still can't quite finish it.</p> <p>That hanger steak costs \u00a313.75; the porterhouse for two costs \u00a354.50; starters from \u00a35.50 to \u00a312; nibbles around \u00a33. An oyster: \u00a31.95. Working-class food at middle-class prices, you could jibe. But it's the ingredients that count, and times change - disease, rarity and desirability all turned the oyster into a fine food in the 19th century, rather than something to bulk up a pie when you ran out of beef. As for the cooking, Hix's food is definitely working, and it's class.</p> <p>\u00b7 Matthew Norman is away.</p> <h2>The bill</h2> <p>Peas in their pods \u00a33</p> <p>Cumbrae \u00a31.95</p> <p>Maldon rocks \u00a31.95</p> <p>Mullet \u00a38</p> <p>Salmon \u00a312</p> <p>Beef &amp; oyster pie \u00a315.45</p> <p>John Dory \u00a326</p> <p>Chips \u00a33.75</p> <p>Scallions \u00a33.75</p> <p>Herb salad \u00a33.75</p> <p>Perry jelly \u00a37.50</p> <p>Buttermilk drop scone \u00a37.25</p> <p>1 bottle C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne \u00a327.50</p> <p>1 glass Maury \u00a37.75</p> <p>1 espresso \u00a31.50</p> <p>Subtotal \u00a3131.10</p> <p>Service @ 12.5% \u00a316.39</p> <p><strong>Total \u00a3147.49</strong></p>",

  "<p>You can't judge a book by its cover, but it's not a bad place to start. The design of the fiction put out by John Lehmann in the late 1940s and early 50s had the louche swagger to complement an edgily cosmopolitan list: Jean-Paul Sartre, Saul Bellow, Gore Vidal, John Dos Passos, Paul Bowles. You could smell fierce French tobacco lingering on tanned pages and sample exotic locations filtered through fugues of premature sex tourism. The books looked good enough to frame, we took the contents on trust. And being by 1975 a trader in forlorn and forgotten literature, I slid copies of two London novels published by Lehmann under my stall, in the fond belief that the John Minton dust-wrappers would give them a market value at some unspecified future date.</p> <p>The novels were credited to someone called Roland Camberton. I set them aside: until the time was right to make the discovery that the most exotic location of all, the true heart of darkness, was on my doorstep in Hackney; a slack-waisted borough of which Camberton was the unrecognised laureate. Despite the gentile surname, he wrote within a recognised Jewish tradition: the unsentimental education, the investigation of a wider city and the breaking away from the clinging embrace of an orthodox family. Rites of passage involved expeditions to the real East End, before sticky experiments with Soho caf\u00e9s and clubs. Versions of this story with greater or lesser degrees of cynicism and panache would include Simon Blumenfeld's Jew Boy (1935), Alexander Baron's The Lowlife (1963), The World is a Wedding (1963) by Bernard Kops, Emanuel Litvinoff's A Journey Through a Small Planet (1972) and even Harold Pinter's The Dwarfs (1990). Naturally, the authors denied any familial connection and dismissed the lesser titles in the series as incompetent, fraudulent and not worth 10 minutes of any serious reader's time. Baron, more generous than the rest, was interviewed by Ken Worpole as background for Worpole's first book, Dockers and Detectives (1983). The Hackney author moved the discussion straight back to Lehmann. \"The people you speak of were all discoveries of John Lehmann, a part of his attempt to find a proletarian literature. This had its condescending side. There is, from Lehmann and his ilk, a homosexual attitude to the working class.\"</p> <p>Litvinoff confirmed this accusation when I talked to him for a film on submerged London writers in 1992. He recalled being invited, when still in uniform and heavy boots, to Lehmann's elegant flat, where the publisher was waiting, draped in a No\u00ebl Coward dressing-gown, drink in hand. There was a vampiric thirst for fresh blood, hard male prose, the subterranea of the city. Lehmann had other sources of income, shadowy business interests; publishing was a superior hobby, a way of meeting interesting young men. Much of the zest in English fiction comes from rogue individualists looking for new ways to lose money by leaving orphaned books for future scavengers to discover and promote.</p> <p>One of Lehmann's tricks was to pair off a modest working-class writer with a posh but troubled artist such as Minton. The zones where the tribes collided, in apocalyptic blind dates, were Soho and Fitzrovia. Moneyed dilettantes, professional scroungers and the thirsty dead: shoulder to shoulder, they fought for space at favoured bars. They worked much harder than nine-to-five civilians to promote their own legends, to the point where some other mug would write the book for them. The point, as Dylan Thomas and Julian Maclaren-Ross soon learnt, where you become an actor in the anecdote of a rival is the point where your words are no longer required. It's time to disappear. To play the final card: suicide by other means. The last train to the suburbs. Stiff nights on the bench in the Russell Square Turkish baths. Trembling hands failing to get cold coffee, unspilled, to scabby lips. Late-bohemianism is a career better recollected than experienced.</p> <p>Scamp, published by Lehmann in 1950, is Roland Camberton's first novel. It is set in Soho, Bloomsbury and Fitzrovia; in the rented rooms, pubs, all-night caf\u00e9s where the author could well have come across Minton and certainly did lurch against Maclaren-Ross. Ivan Ginsberg occupies a rat-infested bathroom-kitchen, while trying to scam the funds for a stillborn literary magazine. The cancelled cheque stubs of Camberton's own life are an audition for the real business: the manufacturing of fiction.</p> <p>\"Ginsberg found himself confronted with the type-writer . . . A story a day, that was his minimum task; two thousand words, preferably with a plot, development, a climax, and a twist. After six months of this routine, he was beginning to feel an intense hatred of the short story, in fact, of all writing. What an abominable occupation it was!\"</p> <p>Camberton's prose is feisty, but there is something fugitive about the Hackney writer: if he has broken away from his roots, he knows they will reach out to choke him. The novel is heady with the delusion of freedom, but it's on parole. Delivered like an over-researched thesis, Scamp is quietly triumphant about coming into existence, but crushed by the horrible labour of composition. Nobody wants a new recipe for oblivion.</p> <p>Maclaren-Ross reviewed Scamp with withering condescension: \"Mr Camberton, who appears to be devoid of any narrative gift, makes this an excuse for dragging in disconnectedly and to little apparent purpose a series of thinly disguised local or literary celebrities.\" One of whom, although he doesn't mention it, is Maclaren-Ross himself, lightly disguised as the \"former commercial traveller\" Angus Sternforth Simms. \"That he found time to write at all puzzled the little crowd of habitu\u00e9s which watched him and heard him every evening, with respectful animosity, at his corner of the bar.\"</p> <p>Other notices were more encouraging. Scamp won the Somerset Maugham award for 1951. Camberton was invited to the Ritz to be inspected by his lizardly benefactor. A friend wondered how they had got along. \"Oh, marvellous,\" Camberton reported. \"He asked if I wanted tea or whisky. And I said whisky. Maugham said, 'That's right, good show! I'm going to have both.' And then we put English fiction to the sword.\" Maugham left the judging of his prize to a committee. Kingsley Amis, the winner in 1955 and the dominant voice of his generation, was a writer against whom the old man nursed numerous prejudices. 'Boorish and provincial,' he said to Camberton: but, all too soon, the author of Scamp was drifting out of print and into Grub Street anonymity.</p> <p>The second book is always hard. Camberton, in choosing to set Rain on the Pavements (1951) in Hackney, was composing his own obituary. Blackshirt demagogues, the spectre of Oswald Mosley's legions, stalk Ridley Road Market while the exiled author ransacks his memory for an affectionate and exasperated account of an orthodox community in its prewar lull. Competing voices shout across a crowded kitchen where loyalty to family battles against hairball claustrophobia. The novel unfolds through a sequence of discrete but connected short stories, which fade away into sudden darkness; an untimely return to Poland, erasure, silence.</p> <p>I suspect that the character of Uncle Jake is a refracted self-portrait by the author. A midnight cyclist and compulsive autodidact, Jake wobbles between ideologies, short-lived enthusiasms. He taps on his nephew's window, asking to share the narrow put-u-up bed. Like Camberton, Jake decides to join the Royal Air Force. He has to get away from everything that makes him what he is.</p> <p>\"The family realised that the mystical cord which, for all his eccentricities, bound Jake to them and to all that was reasonable and normal, had snapped, cruelly, inexplicably, and unnecessarily. Jake was, voluntarily and alone, descending to the lowest section of society; he was going to become a homeless casual labourer, a tramp, a criminal even. A young man who had no money, no job, no home, no wife, no friends, was, in essence, a criminal.\"</p> <p>Jake's guilty secret is that, without letting friends or family know, he has published a novel. And its title is: Failure. There is a schizophrenic moment when David Hirsch, the narrator, opens the book written by Camberton's alter ego: \"With what strange feelings David opened the thin, ill-printed, yellow-wrappered volume. It was as though the past itself had been drawn, temporarily but without noticeable change, from the vaults of the museum.\"</p> <p>Then Camberton vanishes, nothing is heard from him again; he publishes no third book. Minton's dust-wrapper for Scamp takes on the jaundiced colouring of the uncut pages of Failure. A balding man, left hand in pocket, right hand gripping a furtive typescript, slouches down the cobbles; past the pub, out of the frame, into the wilderness.</p> <p>I asked Patrick Wright, who had befriended Litvinoff and written very effectively about his work, what the acerbic old man felt about Camberton. \"He was totally dismissive,\" Wright said. \"Those two books, Litvinoff reckoned, had nothing to do with the East London he had known as a young man. They were opportunistic, banal. He preferred to remember Wolf Mankowitz. Now there was a man who knew how to make money.\" As to Camberton's later career, Litvinoff thought he had spotted him once, going into the offices of the Reader's Digest, but he couldn't be sure.</p> <p>Baron, put by Worpole to recalling the \"Jewish East End writers\" of his acquaintance, finished with the Litvinoff brothers. And then, after a long pause, he mentioned one more. \"Oh yes, I'd almost forgotten him: Roland Camberton. I saw him once at a party. I think, like Pinter and myself, he went to Hackney Downs School. I can't remember whose party it was, except that it was somewhere in St John's Wood. I didn't venture very often into these exotic territories. I had this little uneasy chat with Camberton, a strange man. That's it. That's all I know.\"</p> <p>And there it would have finished, with no more information than you could retrieve from the flap of one of Camberton's novels. Born in Manchester in 1921. Brought up in London. Served in the RAF as a wireless mechanic. Worked as teacher, copywriter, translator, tutor, canvasser, publisher's traveller. A future project, an autobiographical book called Down Hackney, is floated. But nobody I have spoken to has ever seen a typescript.</p> <p>The nagging mystery was one of many I worried at, up to the point when I started work on my own memoir, a documentary-fiction called Hackney, That Rose-Red Empire. I projected a connection with the author of the book-within-a-book, Failure. Camberton's topography, his questing excursions, haunted me, becoming, in their fashion, a kind of model. \"It was necessary to know every alley, every cul-de-sac, every arch, every passageway; every school, every hospital, every church, every synagogue; every police station, every post office, every labour exchange, every lavatory; every curious shop name, every kids' gang, every hiding place, every muttering old man . . . In fact everything; and having got to know everything, they had to hold this information firmly, to keep abreast of change, to locate the new position of beggars, newsboys, hawkers, street shows, gypsies, political meetings.\"</p> <p>Amen! Huzzah! My mad creed in a single paragraph.</p> <p>Having absorbed Hackney, its lost rivers, demolished theatres and built-over market gardens, Camberton's continued existence was tautologous: he had become the spirit of place. And through place, miles walked, he was to be recovered. Or so I excused my failure as literary snoop, uncommissioned private eye. Until, in the most unexpected way, the name of the vanished writer jumped out at me. A slender booklet, Walking the London Scene (Five Walks in the Footsteps of the Beat Generation) by Sydney R Davies, dropped on my doormat. Here was permission for a jug of coffee and a rest from my researches. I followed with interest the story of how a person called Douglas Lyne, described as an \"archivist and Chelsea habitu\u00e9\", met William Burroughs. They drink together. Lyne lends Burroughs a pound. Returning from Tangiers, the notorious junkie repays the loan. A line of double brandies is fired back in celebration. When the two men meet again, in a pub called the Surprise, they are joined by a third: Henry Cohen. Lyne decides that they will go back to his flat and make a recording on a creaking reel-to-reel machine.</p> <p>They are now, all three, quite drunk. The man from the pub, Cohen, the one who will operate the recording machine, was himself, years ago, a published writer. That might have been the source of his irritation. His books were classically constructed, widely reviewed and completely forgotten. To hide the shame of his alternative career from his strictly religious family, Cohen took another name: Roland Camberton. This Chelsea night must have been one of the most fantastic conjunctions in literary mythology: like a posthumous nightmare for Maugham. Burroughs, the hierophant of fractured modernism, interrogated by a champion of the local, the specific, Hackney picaresque.</p> <p>Naturally, I had to track down the tape. It became a grail, all of my interests converging on a single elusive object. I made contact with Davies and he arranged a meeting, south of the river, a long way from Chelsea, at the house where Lyne now lived. Lyne was a person adrift in memory, calling up anecdotes of military life, intertwined with genealogies of the Welsh Marches and musings on the rogue priest, Father Ignatius, who raised a girl from the dead in Wellclose Square. He was a charming and discursive anecdotalist, the years in pubs and clubs had not been wasted. He wouldn't be deflected, by my Camberton probings, from the unravelling of an invisible thread. There were mugs of slow tea and many chocolate biscuits. Lyne, with his swept-back silver hair, trim moustache, milky eye, was like a benevolent General Pinochet.</p> <p>Roland Camberton - or Henry Cohen, as he had known him - was one of his closest friends. Lyne moved in the post-war Soho world of documentary films and drinking clubs where he mingled with writers, painters, adventurers on the lookout for new islands. \"Johnny Minton was one of us. He did the covers for Henry's books.\"</p> <p>The first meeting between Lyne and Cohen was in Chelsea at the Pier Hotel. \"All the local mandarins were lolling about,\" Lyne told me. \"Dregs and real dregs. With the great Henry. Who was an extremely distinguished-looking Jewish man. Like a great composer. Huge brow. We drank and we chatted away. We bought - it must have been me - a bottle of wine. And we went back to Henry's room. He said: 'I've just won a prize. Somerset Maugham has given me \u00a3500.' Maugham thought Henry was a good storyteller. And he was right. Henry could do colourful characters. He had great warmth. He loved listening to what you had to say, but he didn't like wasting his time doing practical things.\"</p> <p>And so, inch by inch, a narrative of the lost years was teased out. Cohen learnt to write in the air force. \"When I had a spare moment in the office,\" he told Lyne, \"I would scribble bits and pieces and read them out at lunchtime and see who laughed at which passage. I was quite surprised, they liked my stuff. But the bits I liked they found high-fallutin' and boring.\" Coming across an article by Lehmann in which he said that he was searching for English authors with the urban fizz of Saul Bellow, Cohen decided to make an approach. He took his RAF gratuity and moved west. \"I was spending all my time in Soho. Living it up as far as I could. Drinking. Courting the girls. I'd come from a stuffy orthodox Jewish background. I found Soho life fascinating and I thought other people would want to hear about it. I wrote Scamp. And I remembered John Lehmann.\"</p> <p>After Scamp, there was talk of a film. But nothing happened. Cohen produced some journalism for trade magazines. He kept his head resolutely down. \"You couldn't say that's what Henry was doing, freelance journalism,\" Lyne reported. \"You couldn't ask. Henry wasn't a man who did things. He just ran out of ideas. I should have learnt more from him. I didn't take him seriously. I think he had an interior purpose. He hated to be known. He was a very secretive person.\"</p> <p>The pseudonym Cohen adopted was resolutely non-Jewish. He cast himself as a matin\u00e9e idol rescued from some forgotten Hollywood programmer witnessed at the Clarence in Lower Clapton. Ronald Colman, Madeleine Carroll and Roland Camberton in The Prisoner of Zenda: such was the fantasy. The reality of this grubbing, scratching postwar era was membership of a literary underclass described by Maclaren-Ross (in a letter to Lehmann) as being made up of those who \"live like rats among the ruins which they themselves have helped to honeycomb\".</p> <p>The family didn't give up on the decamped eldest son. Lyne remembers an afternoon in his studio flat. \"This very Hatton Garden sort of chap came around. He had a set of sacrificial knives which he used for cutting animals' throats. Henry jumped up. 'This is my brother.' The brother said: 'I've come to bring you home to Hackney.' Henry told me that the same scene happened every week. His father was ill.\"</p> <p>Lyne got married, changed pub, lost touch with his friend. Years later, in Soho, he bumped into Henry again. \"He was with a very attractive woman. I think he must have been knocking about with her for quite a long time. She was very gentile, very county. Enormously devoted to him in a distant kind of way. She didn't like being associated with Soho or drink.\"</p> <p>Cohen said that things were going rather well. \"She's got lots of money. She wants to get married. She's got a house, with hunting and that kind of thing. I go down there. My family have cut me off, they don't want to see me. I can't go on. I don't really have anything to do.\" Roland Camberton had grown into the situation that befell Uncle Jake in the novel written so many years before. \"He lost touch completely with the family . . . their relationship was quietly wrapped up, as it were, placed in the cupboard of limbo, and locked away.\"</p> <p>Ducking and diving, Cohen had the painful task of reading other people's novels for MGM: could they be turned into films? He brought Lyne onboard - and Lyne, in return, set Cohen up with a trial, writing copy for EBIS (Engineering in Britain Information Services). \"What's this fellow done?\" said the boss. \"A picaresque Soho novel and a book about Hackney.\" \"Good God! I can find 20 people to write picaresque novels about Hackney. I want someone who writes dull-as-ditchwater technical material.\"</p> <p>At the end of Cohen's first month, Adrian Seligman, who ran the operation, told Lyne they were going to have a big party. \"What are we celebrating?\" \"Henry's departure. He's a marvellous writer, but it takes him weeks to polish a paragraph.\"</p> <p>After this setback, news of Cohen came by way of an accountant, Leslie Periton. Periton was a partner in the firm of AT Shenhalls, who represented Terence Rattigan, Benjamin Britten and Leslie Howard. Lehmann persuaded them to take on the promising young winner of the Somerset Maugham award. Periton and Lyne had lunch together, once a year. \"Henry was exactly the type Periton wanted,\" Lyne said, \"a man who didn't have any interest in making money. Periton probably got him the job at MGM to keep him afloat. Nobody knows if Henry ever wrote anything else under another name. My view is, at the times I ran into him, he was a declining person. He had problems with his inamorata.\"</p> <p>At one of these epic lunches, somewhere in the mid-60s, Periton said to Lyne: \"It's all up.\" \"What's happened?\" \"Henry's not so good. In fact, he's dead.\" Nobody knew the details, aorta, aneurism. Showing me his inscribed copy of Scamp, without the Minton dustwrapper, Lyne was visibly moved. \"Accumulated memories do work their way to the surface. I have a notion Henry married his lady. They had a child. It could be a whole new chapter in Henry's story.\"</p> <p>From time to time, in a half-hearted way, I tried to interest publishers in bringing Camberton back into print. I was an admirer of the series of London Books Classics being put out by John King and his partners. In considering Rain on the Pavements they made the usual attempts to find the person who held the copyright and they came up with a name: Claire Camberton. Could this be the child mentioned by Lyne? I was given Claire's details and a meeting was arranged.</p> <p>A woman with bright eyes, animate but tentative, arrived on my doorstep, dragging a large red case on wheels. She was, as she told me, no stranger to Hackney. She brought reams of documentation, photocopies of letters, snapshots, books: the fruits of 20 years' research. She was astonished to meet another Camberton enthusiast and we were instantly exchanging snippets of information, trying to fit the jigsaw together. Claire was indeed the daughter of Henry Cohen, but not the child of the late marriage. Her story was unexpected and poignant.</p> <p>\"I was born in December 1954. My mother's name was Lilian Joyce Brown. She was from Andover in Hampshire. She lived in London during the war, working as a silver-service waitress at the Savoy. She was three years younger than my father. She died 20 years ago at the age of 64. She was a bit reclusive towards the end of her life and fairly secretive too.\"</p> <p>Lilian Brown met Henry Cohen when she attended one of the evening classes he gave, in short-story writing, at the City Literary Institute in Covent Garden. Lilian, her daughter recalls, was a pretty woman who was frustrated by her lack of formal education. She had a sharp eye for antiques and secondhand books and she haunted street markets. Very soon an affair was under way: \"Mum liked Jewish men; it was a bit rebellious at the time. My father pursued her and chatted her up. Mum told me, in her rather prim way, that he was very virile.\"</p> <p>They came to an arrangement: she would carry Cohen's child and, after giving birth, hand her over. Cohen's mistress of the moment, a Jewish woman, couldn't have children. Claire's mother moved to London, Thornton Street on the Stockwell-Brixton border, and she received an allowance of \u00a326 a month from Cohen's solicitors. She changed her name by deed poll to Camberton. Life in those ground-floor flats, as Claire remembers it, consisted of \"plastic knives and forks and making do\". The Camberton pseudonym had a simple explanation. \"My father made the name up by combining Camberwell and Brixton. He hated them both. He hated coming south of the river. He was very proud of the fact that he lived in Chelsea.\"</p> <p>Lilian decided to keep the baby. A terrible scene ensued, the last time the infant Claire saw her father. \"It was all Hollywood then. Everything was a story, a romance. When mum decided to call herself Camberton, my father slid away. He ended the association.\" The estranged couple met on Clapham Common in 1956. \"My father produced a huge stack of legal papers and presented them to my mother. Isn't that dramatic? I was in the pram. That was their final parting, the end of the relationship. There was no further point of contact.\" It was like a replay of an image from Graham Greene's Clapham Common novel of secrets and betrayal, The End of the Affair.</p> <p>As Claire pointed out, the character Margaret in Scamp seems to be a guilty memory of her father's relationship with Lilian Brown; even though Scamp was published before her parents met. \"It's a melodramatic plot line,\" Claire said. \"She's three months pregnant and she kills herself. The whole theme is right there: a woman who is not of his class, not in his league, and having a child. That's probably why he didn't want my mother to read it.\"</p> <p>Scamp presents an anti-hero, Ginsberg, who courts failure, relishes obscurity, and has an eye for a waitress. \"Ginsberg was very much aware of her desirable presence by his side; so delightful were her little moues and winks that he . . . felt like . . . whispering into her ear an invitation.\" There was another woman in reserve. \"Until Lolita became his mistress, Ginsberg was delighted with the novelty of this courtship. But afterwards there was nothing to sustain their relations except recrudescent desire . . . Ginsberg was also still ashamed of Lolita's background, which, though it might supply colour for an adventure, an anecdote, made a long-term affair impossible. At the same time he was ashamed of being ashamed . . .\"</p> <p>Among Claire's papers was a photocopy of \"Truant Muse\", an article by June Rose published in the Jewish Chronicle in 1965, just before Camberton died. Rose wanted to discover why certain writers \"whose names were once well known . . . sped into obscurity\". Cohen, she decided, was \"the kind of individual who finds it pleasant to vegetate\". He retreated to a bungalow beside the sea. \"London history is his special subject and he writes with erudition and clarity in small reviews.\" The article is accompanied by a photograph: a balding, melancholy man. Like a cinema organist after the coming of sound. Here, without question, is the stalking figure drawn by Minton for the cover of Scamp. That image is taken from life.</p> <p>And there is one more surprise: a \"major work\", never published, Tango. The journal of a hitch-hiking odyssey around Britain, an English On the Road. \"The writing is at times Orwellian,\" Rose enthuses. Camberton laid out his plans in a letter to the Jewish Chronicle. \"My intention is to make two journeys: one, partly on foot, through Europe . . . and the second to North America.\" Tango was rejected by his publisher and has not resurfaced.</p> <p>\"Roland Camberton is essentially an isolated figure,\" Rose concluded. \"A man in a mackintosh, dignified, anonymous, alone. He is isolated from other writers, from the Jewish community . . . and his essential anonymity implies almost an element of choice.\"</p> <p>A firm of Wimbledon solicitors informed Claire's mother that Cohen had changed his name a second time, shortly before his marriage. The new name was never to be revealed. The allowance would stop. The site of the grave would remain a secret.</p> <p>I had been chasing the wrong story. Dying at the age of 44, Ronald Camberton left behind books that are worth searching out, as well as the lost manuscript of a journey on foot across Europe. At that point in my own life, I had scarcely begun; a bookseller in Uppingham was considering taking a punt on my first eccentric novel. I had lived in Hackney for 20 years without becoming part of its dream.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Iain Sinclair's Hackney, That Rose-Red Empire will be published by Hamish Hamilton in February next year.</p>",
  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>For 20 years my husband has held on to a small, tarnished silver cup. Wherever we move, this ageing relic follows. \"What is it, Dad?\" asks our 11-year-old daughter. It turns out that, in 1975, my husband had been crowned King Crab of Cemaes Bay after winning the annual crabbing competition in the most northerly town in Anglesey.</p> <p>The rugged resort was where my husband and his four siblings spent every summer. Unlike our own four offspring. Their summers have been spent in France, Italy and Spain. But the credit has crunched and a UK holiday beckons. Cemaes Bay it is.</p> <p>We pick up the keys for the Studio Cottage from the landlady of Ye Olde Vigour pub. \"It can't be Cerys,\" gasps my husband. </p> <p>\"Paul, I don't believe it,\" she replies. \"How are you? It must be more than 20 years.\" </p> <p>A long conversation follows and I begin to feel cheered as she refers to holidaymakers as \"visitors\". And our children begin to believe the impossible - that their dad was once a boy. Three hours later after a marathon beachcombing session where we find crabs, mudskippers, baby lobsters, a baby eel and rock pools we head \"home\".</p> <p>The following day we visit the small pier and the harbourmaster's cottage to arrange a fishing trip. The waters are a little choppy but we manage to find our sea legs, and our 13-year-old swaps the thrill of a mobile phone beeping for the pull of a rod.</p> <p>Safely back ashore, my husband catches sight of a plaque commemorating the life of a local fisherman. He stops and is instantly transported back to the day of his father's funeral when he was just 13.</p> <p>The young boy found great comfort from the reassuring presence of several Cemaes Bay fishermen who had made the long trip to Liverpool for the service. The name on the plaque belongs to one of those men.</p> <p>We walk back along the headland to White Lady Bay, named after the rock in the shape of a woman's head.</p> <p>Past and present merge as we explore beaches, coves and caves. Our youngest two wade bare-chested through the River Wygyr, fishing nets in hand, like latterday Huckleberry Finns.</p> <p>Finally, the big day dawns. King Crab must face his toughest test. Our children are handed buckets and crabbing lines to challenge for the title.</p> <p>At noon the high tide rolls back to shore, seagulls scream overhead and five intrepid crabbers cast their lines. After a slow start there are two clear winners. Our 13-year-old and his dad. At 26 crabs each, there has to be a decider.</p> <p>A small crowd gathers and within seconds Joe feels a pull. Inch by inch he carefully pulls in the line before plopping the unsuspecting crustacean into the crowded bucket.</p> <p>We have a new champion. King Crab is dead.

Nine years old, more bruiser than ballet dancer, and suddenly having to live up to the expectations that people have of you when you share a first name with 007. </p> <p>But he didn't let the pressure get to him. He attacked the trampoline enthusiastically, threw in a half-hearted star jump, and landed firmly - possibly causing a few waves in the infinity pool nearby.</p> <p>Despite being built for the rugby pitch, James was hooked. Every morning, while the rest of us took our time over croissants, James and his sister, LouLou, went to learn tricks at the circus school.</p> <p>And that's the beauty of a Pierre et Vacances holiday: you get a lovely villa, and your kids - or your nieces and nephew, in my case - get to do all sorts of things that they can't do at home. Like hanging off a trapeze, or staring at French women's breasts.</p> <p>Topless sunbathing apart, the resorts are designed for families. Our resort at Les Restanques - close to pretty Port Grimaud and about 10km from the Maseratis and yachts of St Tropez - had three swimming pools, a kids' club and free entertainment in the outdoor amphitheatre (magic one night, Europop the next). </p> <p>We'd head out for dinner in Port Grimaud where the kids enjoyed ordering \"diabolo fraises\" - strawberry syrup with lemonade - and tried not to giggle when the man at the next table ordered a steak tartare. Memories of Mr Bean, struggling with his raw meat, ensured that 13-year-old Charlotte stowed her handbag safely out of the way.</p> <p>In the mornings, we'd all pretend to be asleep so that someone else would fetch the baguettes from the shop at the top of a very steep hill for breakfast. And James and LouLou? They were the stars of the show at the end-of-week circus school spectacular. </p> <p>Unfazed by the other kids' flashy displays, James had his finale all worked out. He simply ambled on to the stage - and gave us a twirl.<br><strong>Madeleine Redway, Leicester</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Pierre et Vacances village of Les Restanques du Golfe de St Tropez (00 33 4 94 55 60 00, <a href=\"http://www.pierreetvacances.com\">pierreetvacances.com</a>).</p> <h2>Highland games<br>Nepal</h2> <p>Eight tries to six when bad light stopped play. We were on a four-day trek in the Himalayan foothills, watching a rugby match between five English boys in our group and five Nepalese village boys. We were camping at 3,000ft and the English boys had just explained to the opposition how to play this bizarre game - using a burst volleyball. An audience of 36 Sherpas, a dozen parents and siblings and a handful of villagers all roared approval and cheered their home country. But what made the experience even more extraordinary was the campsite: a tiny piece of flat land on a rugged precipice. Across the valleys were ridges of thick tree-laden hillsides, the magnificent Annapurna range where griffon vultures soared on warm air currents. </p> <p>The trek never exceeded 3,000ft (thankfully, for those of us who think three laps of Sainsbury's should be an Olympic event), but it was enough altitude to experience the lush vegetation and endless rice terraces, and to meet the women who tend them.</p> <p>The Nepali people, particularly the Sherpas, were enthusiastic and humorous, cracking jokes about the basic toilet facilities, carrying kids in baskets, entertaining the troops with volleyball and cooking unbelievable meals. At one post-trek hotel we endured a breakfast of stale cornflakes with sour yak milk, followed by toast with pink bubblegum-flavoured jam (like something in a Roald Dahl novel) - but not when trekking. Here, breakfasts were porridge, scrambled eggs, pancakes and omelettes.</p> <p>The relative solitude of the countryside contrasted to city life in Kathmandu. We were expecting variety but there were so many people, so much traffic, so much noise, and poverty. Nepal provided an emotional experience for all of us. We weren't sure what to expect but we certainly never anticipated that a rugby match would feature in our once-in-a-lifetime experiences.<br><strong>Andrew Mackay, Settle, North Yorkshire</strong></p> <h2>Fringe benefits<br>Edinburgh</h2> <p>It is the last of 10 days in Scotland and we have driven all the way across it. We have seen hills and rivers, midges and seals, slept in a large number of beds, and now we are in Edinburgh.</p> <p>On the way into the city we see the zoo, and the kids exclaim with joy. Half-heartedly, I promise we'll visit, but first we must find the youth hostel. It's hot and we're hungry but then we see people in costumes, wigs and fancy make-up. The festival has started! All my life I've wanted to see it and now here I am with two young kids who want only to go to the zoo.</p> <p>We can't check into the hostel for three hours. \"Let's just go to the zoo,\" my partner says. The kids are ecstatic, I'm sad. But by chance we reach the Royal Mile and there they are: three men, two emitting high-pitched squeaks and one playing ... \"Your instrument, Mummy, look!\" Yes, an accordion. They are performing a play about penguins, I think, and opposite are three other musicians, one with a cello, and two bald guys playing violins and dancing the can-can. The kids are hooked. \"Can we see their show? And theirs?\" A man, covered with blood, drags himself along the pavement, while others comfort onlookers that he is merely a trained actor. A gorgeous vampire offers us Dracula on a bouncy castle. The zoo is forgotten.

We carry shiny bits away with us and are - all of us - thoroughly pleased at last.<br><strong>Saskia Wesnigk-Wood, Brighton</strong></p> <h2>The singing baker<br>Tuscany</h2> <p>It was my last family holiday before my parents' divorce. We rented a villa in the hills south of Florence for a very regular holiday. We looked at the churches in Tuscany, ate gelato in Siena, even took a photograph \"leaning\" against the Tower of Pisa.</p> <p>However, our first night was definitely not ordinary. Arriving, shattered from Pisa airport, we met our landlord who introduced himself with a bunch of flowers and a female translator. He was the local baker, she said in English rather more quiet than his booming Italian. He gave us some bread to prove it.</p> <p>We just wanted to crash out, but our host, through his assistant, suggested we come to the church. \"He's going to sing.\" We climbed into our tiny, still unfamiliar hire car, and began a precarious, twisting journey around the hilltop to the church. </p> <p>It seemed as if the whole village had turned up, and we shuffled into the full pews near the back.</p> <p>Our host stepped in front of the altar, his bulging jacket and flushed cheeks now joined by a bow tie. Without any fuss, and accompanied by another villager on the piano, he began to sing opera. I don't know if he was the best tenor, but I do know that I was transfixed. I remained transfixed for his entire performance.</p> <p>That evening destroyed any cynicism I had about classical music. Clearly the best way to appreciate opera is to hear it sung by the local baker of a Tuscan village.<br><strong>Joseph Farthing, Aberdeen</strong></p> <h2>Extracurricular education<br>Crete</h2> <p>What's the first thing friends want to know about a family holiday in June? \"Did you have to pay off the head mistress to get permission to take your son out of school?\" No. I volunteered for five more years' tombola duty at the summer fair.</p> <p>Thirty minutes' drive from Chania airport, the village of Maheri (population 50) includes Roula and Costas, the owners of Kamares Village Houses, restored Cretan/Venetian buildings set around terraces of fruit trees on the side of a mountain. </p> <p>Our villa was equipped with a kitchen adjoining the garden with panoramic views north to the Aegean Sea, where we would dine under a vine-covered gazebo. </p> <p>These occasions were special enough with local dishes cooked to Roula's grandmother's recipes and home-grown fruit and vegetables along with locally caught fish. But the highlight was Sunday's Patatas Festival; a feast of potato dishes and mountain greens eaten while our host worked his way through three bottles of ouzo.</p> <p>The welcome extended into Roula's personal history as she took us for a guided tour of her birthplace, Chania. A tireless campaigner on environmental issues, she explained how the island has changed, and how her approach to tourism is intended to benefit the countryside and its people. Such mind-expanding breaks should be included on the curriculum. <br><strong>Nick Stockman, Brighton</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Kamares Village Holidays (00 30 282 1044 134, <a href=\"http://www.kamares-houses.gr\">kamares-houses.gr</a>). </p> <h2>Summer sails<br>Turkey</h2> <p>I'm swimming in azure water where we've anchored for the evening. The late summer sun is pressing a lovely deep brown tan into my back, when there's a loud bleat. A whole herd of goats plod out from the squat bushes on the shore, knock-kneed and curious, and start drinking from the water, not five feet away. Apparently they like the salt.</p> <p>Ten of us are on a Mediterranean adventure which started in Marmaris, where we met our crew from Zephyria Yachting along with the breathtaking luxury gulet, Zephyria II: 32m long, all polished, dark wooden decks, padded seats and tall, white sails. </p> <p>Captain Alf has a ponytail so is immediately dubbed Captain Jack Sparrow. The rest of the six-strong Turkish crew are a lovely bunch, all amused at our idea of fun (cocktails and pole dancing to Britney Spears).</p> <p>Everything was simple. Wake up whenever, breakfast, swim, sun bake, lunch, plus there was a speedboat with water skis and a wakeboard. </p> <p>The highly anticipated family cocktail hour rolled around at 6.30pm, and the evening meal featured delicacies such as smoked eggplant puree with a traditional lamb ragout or baked fish with wild rice salad. We drifted from bay to bay, up the coastline towards Bodrum, stopping where we pleased.</p> <p>But all good things must come to an end. As we were sulkily waiting for our ferry back to Kos, we saw the magnificent Zephyria II pull out of the harbour. We sighed and started to turn away, but saw a movement. The crew had come out and were waving, grinning away with Captain Jack at the helm. Then, with a quick salute, he was back to his job, navigating the endless stretch of the blue Aegean Sea.<br><strong>Simone Knox, London</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Zephyria Yachting (90 252 316 9432, <a href=\"http://www.zephyria-yachting.com\">zephyria-yachting.com</a>). </p> <h2>Sweet views<br>Ambleside</h2> <p>What I want from a holiday is sleep, cakes of all varieties, some soul-feeding walks and to get out of the parental role of nagging, tidying and organising. </p> <p>The result was an apartment in Ambleside with the cake factor supplied by Lucy's of Ambleside, which has a cafe, bistro and deli. Unexpectedly, the idea went down well with our five-year-old, Faith, due to pencil envy of her friend's Lakeland watercolour pencils, and the prospect of a balcony giving ample Disney princess re-enactment opportunities. </p> <p>One day, we set off up Cat Bells, chosen for the great view over Derwent Water and exciting scrambling without much preliminary slog. We got up there, puffed out and hot, and the sense of space and grandeur from the (nearly) top was fantastic; it also gave us a taste of what we may be able to do in the future. Not bad, as Molly (20 months) tolerates her backpack only briefly and is a keen walker - though usually not in the right direction.</p> <p>And getting out of our usual roles? Well, another day my other half went to Costa to check his work email, and in my child-free daze I found myself in the hardware store asking about bathroom mildew removers.

Eating termites and coming face to face with tarantulas, monkey, macaw, caiman, giant otters and tree frogs (sometimes in our beds) was an adventure our two children (Rachel, 9, and Liam, 12) still recount to their friends. </p> <p>Our Peruvian journey started almost three weeks earlier in Arequipa, a town high in the Andes under the constant gaze of the El Misti volcano. The children were fascinated but slightly saddened in the Museo Santury, when they came face to face with Juanita, the frozen ice princess - an Inca girl sacrificed on Mount Ampato in 1440.</p> <p>On Lake Titicaca we took a boat to the floating Uros reed archipelago. The houses have been made from reeds since the Incas, and we spent the night with a local family on Amantani island.</p> <p>In Machu Picchu the children moved up and down the site pretending, like Hiram Bingham, to be the first to discover this archeological treasure. We stayed in the wonderful Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel where 18 species of humming bird hovered around us while we walked through the cloud forest grounds. Later, over a bottle of Tacama wine, we promised to finance my son's expedition to the Inca trail in five years' time - but I think the whole family will want to go with him.<br><strong>Martin Myers, Preston</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel (0800 458 7506, <a href=\"http://www.inkaterra.com\">inkaterra.com</a>).</p> <h2>Market values<br>Marrakech</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337082603\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/family.jpg\" alt=\"Family eating in Jmaa el Fna square, Marrakech\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Sutton and children in Jmaa el Fna square, Marrakech</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Sutton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was told I was foolish.

That first night, we spend hours in the Jmaa el Fna square, thrilled by the acrobats and baffled by the storytellers and their incomprehensible props: which story involves a doll on a string, a sock and a Lilliputian ladder in a bottle?

  "<p>Oil and gas companies are preparing for a complete shutdown of offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico as tropical storm Gustav gathers strength and churns ominously towards the US coast.</p> <p>Shell and BP evacuated staff from rigs, while ExxonMobil and other operators activated contingency plans to cease operations on offshore facilities that account for a quarter of US crude oil production and 15% of natural gas output.</p> <p>The US department of energy said it would release emergency stocks from the country's strategic petroleum reserves if supplies are severely disrupted.</p> <p>Energy prices rose on concerns that the storm could be the worst to hit the region since hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated New Orleans and the Texas shore three years ago. In New York, the cost of a barrel of oil ended 13 cents down at $115.46 after having hit $118.76 on storm fears.</p> <p>\"Until this hurricane hits, the trend has to be higher, towards the $120 level,\" said Jonathan Kornafel of Hudson Capital Energy. \"If this turns out to be a non-event, the market could really come roaring back down.\"</p> <p>The oil price also received some support from a newspaper report that a Russian oil company, tipped to be Lukoil, could be told to cut supplies to western Europe in response to east-west tension over Georgia. Lukoil said it had not been approached by the Russian government and exports were flowing normally.</p> <p>Russia's deputy prime minister, Igor Sechin, the chairman of Russia's largest oil company, Rosneft, called the suggestion of possible cuts a \"crude provocation\".</p> <p>\"Even during the cold war, regardless of political or any other circumstances, the Soviet Union always fulfilled its contractual obligations to supply Europe with energy, and Russia, a responsible and reliable partner, adheres to the same principle,\" Russian state news agency RIA quoted Sechin as saying.</p> <p>The dollar shrugged off the rise in the oil price and is on track to show its best monthly rise for a decade. But the reverse was true for the pound, which fell to its lowest level for almost 12 years against a basket of currencies.

  "<p>French police are hunting a man who raped a journalism student from London as she prepared a photo-report at an illegal immigrant camp in woods near Calais. </p> <p>The 31-year-old Canadian had been interviewing migrants desperate to reach Britain by stowing away under lorries. The patch of woodland near Calais port is known as The Jungle, where would-be asylum seekers sleep rough under scraps of plastic sheeting. The woman had visited the area three times before she was raped on Tuesday at around 7pm. </p> <p>Philippe Muller, vice-prosecutor of Boulogne-sur-mer, said: \"She was photographing a group of migrants when one of them offered to show her something else. She followed him into a shack in the woods.\" She was raped and beaten before a migrant intervened to stop the attack. </p> <p>Police have issued Interpol with a photofit of the suspect. He is described as being of Middle Eastern origin and speaking fluent French. The authorities have not established if he is a migrant or one of the many people-smugglers who target the area. He is not thought to be French, but the possibility has not been ruled out.</p> <p>The Jungle, with no running water or electricity, has seen thousands of rough-sleepers since the Sangatte Red Cross centre closed in 2002. About 400 people are estimated to be squatting in the woods. Half tend to be from African countries such as Sudan, Mali and Eritrea. Others are from Iraq, Pakistan and Iran. </p> <p>Father Jean-Pierre Boutoille, of the refugee charity C'Sur, said the suspect's fluent French \"suggests he was therefore not actually an illegal immigrant but someone else who was in the wood at that time, as most of the illegal immigrants don't speak French\". </p> <p>Vincent Lenoir, of the Salam association which distributes meals to immigrants, said: \"The atmosphere here among the migrants is one of sadness and shock.\"</p>",
  "<p>Aleksandar Hemon sold his first book, a dazzling story collection called The Question of Bruno - written in his second language, English - in the closing minutes of the 1999 Champions League final. Manchester United were playing Bayern Munich. (\"Manchester United isn't my team, Liverpool is my team, but I hate Bayern Munich,\" he says.) Hemon's agent, Nicole Aragi, had organised an auction, and had been calling the 35-year-old writer with reports on its progress. \"She called me five minutes before the end of the game: 'I've got some great news.' And I said: 'I cannot talk to you right now, I'll call you back,' and hung up. And then Man United scored two goals.\" A smile drifts across Hemon's face at the memory. \"So I called her back, and said: 'Listen, what was so important that you had to call me in the middle of a fucking game?'\" Hemon bounces his cranberry juice on the table at the punchline. \"The Question of Bruno,\" Zadie Smith once remarked, \"is all right I suppose if you appreciate multilingual genius types who learn the language in six months, write with great humour and style and then get compared to Nabokov in the New York Times.\"</p> <p>A big handsome man dressed as a shy fat man - long-sleeved T-shirt into which his hands retreat, several shapeless acres of trouser - Hemon looks as though he has just completed a heavy session of computer programming; he has the awkward power and bulk of a man built by doughnuts. He is, in fact, an obsessive footballer who has been unable to play since spring, when he injured his knee. Perhaps because of this, his demeanour communicates a strange mixture of gentleness and an intense desire to kick something. </p> <p>Since his first book, Hemon has produced two further pieces of fiction in English. The second, Nowhere Man, published in 2002, picked up the story of Josef Pronek, a Hemon-like figure (a Sarajevan stranded in Chicago by the war) who first appeared in The Question of Bruno. Nowhere Man, which narrates Pronek's history from several angles, \"was something between a book of short stories and a novel\". Hemon feels there is too much categorisation in talk about writing. \"To me there's no difference between a book of stories and a novel - they're just slightly different shapes,\" he said. \"I resist when someone calls me a novelist: it implies some kind of inherent superiority of the novel. I'm not a novelist, I'm a writer.\" </p> <p>As the jacket photograph for Nowhere Man testifies, Hemon once had thick, dark, writerly hair; his scalp is now shaved brutally close. His heavy glasses spend most of the time on top of his stubble, where they make a black accent above the round edge of his skull, like a caron over the curved top of a letter O. Other faces seem suddenly skimpy by comparison. (Noses - especially Pronek's - get a hard time in Hemon: Pronek has \"a rotund nose, which seemed swollen\"; elsewhere he observes himself to have \"a tubernose\".) When Hemon slides his glasses down over his eyes, a different man, a superimposed humorist, appears: he looks like a caricature of a man wearing glasses. Nothing is fixed, identity is fluid - a point his fiction makes repeatedly and that he reluctantly concedes in discussion, politely suppressing a wince at the simplistic nature of this observation. His new book, The Lazarus Project, published to adoring reviews, continues to play with real and fictional identities (its protagonist, Vladimir Brik, is a Bosnian writer living in Chicago). Unlike its predecessors, it is unambiguously a novel, although Hemon \"didn't utter the word\" until it was finished. \"I called it 'the big book'.\"</p> <p>Hemon has two countries and two languages, caused in his case by the Yugoslavian civil war. He was born in 1964 and grew up in Sarajevo, in a flat that his family still owns in a \"five-storey socialist-ugly apartment building\". He stays there on trips back to the city (his parents now live in Canada). His parents worked at a state-owned company 10 minutes from their home: his mother as an accountant, his father as an engineer. The family - Hemon, his parents, and his younger sister Kristina - would eat lunch together every day at four, and listen to the radio news, with a special hush at 4.25 for the weather forecast. (The weather obsession has followed his parents to Canada, perhaps, Hemon thinks, because \"it's a comfortable way to imagine the future\" after the upheaval of emigration. \"They have a nice house, a garden, but somehow time is still completely out of joint.\") </p> <p>Circumstances in Sarajevo in the 1970s and 80s were not as syrupy sweet as Pronek remembers them in Nowhere Man (\"The boys were handsome, the girls beautiful, the sports teams successful, the bands good, the streets felt soft as a Persian carpet\"), but life was steady; there was, at least - Hemon uses this word a lot - \"an infrastructure\" that was penetrable to its citizens. \"Even if it's hard, sometimes, even if it's a bureaucracy, it's consistent. You go to get a personal ID, you know they're going to fuck you for two weeks, two months - but it's your choice, when to go back, you know what they're going to do, you can look for connections, you know how it works.\" </p> <p>Hemon's books are full of people who have been taken out of one context and put down in another and can't, now, see how it works - his parents standing mute in a lift as they're cheerily addressed by their American neighbours, Russian intellectuals rendered stupid by English lessons. His fiction understands the nature of such losses. Many of his stories remember life before loss, a child's world - Hemon says the move to America \"amplified\" his childhood memories. More obliquely, some of his fiction's vividness and freshness comes from his exploitation of a child's angle of view: objects loom large. Hemon remembers feeling close to the ground, \"in the literal sense, in that I would see what was on the ground; things that were on the ground attracted my attention\". Things on the ground attract his attention still, often as signifiers of losses too awful to confront directly. In The Lazarus Project, a black leather glove floats in a puddle of porridge after a pogrom. The story \"Blind Josef Pronek and the Dead Souls\", from The Question of Bruno, opens with Pronek arriving in America and realising, instantly and forlornly, that he has lost his scarf. In \"A Coin\", Sarajevans running from snipers litter the street with their belongings: \"A black leather wallet, probably empty. A purse, agape like a mouth. A white plastic water-vessel, with a bullet-hole at its centre. A green-red-brown shawl ornamented with snowflakes, dirty. A wet loaf of bread, with excited ants crawling all over it, as if building a pyramid.\" </p> <p>Hemon was a teenager when Tito died in 1980, and the writer grew interested in political journalism, and ideas such as freedom of speech, which turned out to be a more effective way to bait his parents than wearing ripped jeans. In the Hemon household, a principled stand tended to impede individual progress. \"I would fight for my right to go out in torn jeans, and they'd say absolutely not. My sister would just put on her torn jeans and leave when they weren't paying attention.\" Thanks to his own and his mother's principled refusal to pull any strings, Hemon carried out his year of military service in a grimly distant part of eastern Macedonia. (\"Some of my friends served as ski instructors in the mountains of Belgrade. I was at the border with Bulgaria.\") </p> <p>His time in the army was miserable, his instructor a \"spectacular bastard\" whom Hemon fantasised about murdering with an icicle after the man had marched them through nipple-deep snow. \"I got horribly ill and spent a week in the sanatorium with a temperature, kind of hallucinating, and I kept devising the perfect murder, how could I kill this man ... somehow I thought if I could put a piece of ice in a weapon, and shoot him in the heart, the ice would melt, leaving no trace. I had a fever, and all I ate was plum juice and plum compote, and I would run this film of a perfect ice murder in my head and then I'd pass out.\" </p> <p>Pronek's time in the army, in Nowhere Man, is equally cruddy, though he blithely lies to his parents on his return, \"presenting his army experience as one of bonding with other young men from all across Yugoslavia\". Hemon himself maintains that he cannot lie (he looks me very seriously in the eye when he says this), due to a family affliction: \"When we're upset, our vocal cords tighten and we can't speak. And when I lie - well, I can't lie, because the same thing happens - everyone who knows me knows that when I start squeaking, I've started lying.\"</p> <p>Army service was followed by a degree in English at the University of Sarajevo. Hemon read Nabokov's Lolita in translation (he still remembers the shelf on which the book sat in the library), then worked as a journalist for the Sarajevan youth press. In the winter of 1992, an organisation called the American Cultural Centre brought him to the US on a programme for young journalists. He was 28; the trip was to last a month or so, with a visit to a friend tagged on afterwards. The war began in April. He was supposed to fly back from Chicago on May 1; the siege of Sarajevo started on May 2. \"I didn't go back,\" Hemon says. </p> <p>Hemon's second life now began. Pronek lives a version of it in The Question of Bruno and Nowhere Man - working minimum-wage jobs, learning English. From June 1992 to September 1994, having acquired a social security number, Hemon wrote nothing at all, but worked as a canvasser. \"I don't know what possessed me to do that,\" he says; the job is mercilessly satirised at the end of Nowhere Man, with Pronek knocking on unfriendly doors for Greenpeace (\"Do you care about the dolphins?\"). He dictated several columns by phone to his old magazine in Sarajevo. \"But I found out after these pieces that I could not write in Bosnian. What was I going to tell them - you should go and see this movie? People under siege. I felt entirely helpless, and stupid.\"</p> <p>His much-discussed feat of teaching himself English by reading Nabokov took place around this time. As he describes it, it sounds an entirely sensible approach to the challenge, a kind of highbrow Berlitz course. \"I didn't know half the words. At the beginning I would start underlining the words I didn't know on the page, but then I started underlining too many, so I started writing them out on notecards, and whenever I read, I made lists of words and then looked them up in the dictionary.\" He read other Nabokov too. \"But Lolita ... Lolita is the bomb.\" Reading Lolita in English, after reading it in translation \"was like the difference between listening to an orchestra live and through a phone\". </p> <p>The book helped Hemon to transform himself from a man speaking what he describes as \"tourist English\" (though it is a stretch to imagine the brooding presence in front of me ever having engaged in the formulaic purchase of a double room with a bath or two return tickets), to a writer of prose that the critic James Wood recently described as being \"remarkable for its polish, lustre, and sardonic control of register\". His writing, as many have observed, is reminiscent of Nabokov's. Both fizz with similes; animating the inanimate, reimagining the commonplace. Here is a slug in Hemon: \"The dew on its back twinkled: it looked like a severed tongue.\" A defecating horse's anus opens slowly, \"like a camera aperture\". </p> <p>With his new language in place, Hemon enrolled on a graduate degree in English at Northwestern University. While he was there, chewing up Shakespeare and Marlowe, a professor remarked on the quality of one of his essays and suggested he submit his fiction to the literary magazine Triquarterly. A story in another magazine, Ploughshares, followed, which got him his American agent. He finished The Question of Bruno during his PhD, but he never finished his doctorate. Academia had been \"plan B\"; he was now able to focus on plan A, and write full-time. </p> <p>A $500,000 MacArthur \"Genius\" award in 2004 allowed him to organise his life around writing (and football) rather than survival. The Lazarus Project is a product of this time. His previous books were written \"in pieces\"; the new book was of a piece from the outset. The novel was inspired by a non-fiction account, by Walter Roth and Joe Kraus, of the case of Lazarus Averbuch, a 19-year-old Russian Jewish immigrant who was murdered by the Chicago police in 1908. One photograph in particular caught Hemon's imagination. It shows Averbuch (dark hair, dark jacket, jug ears) sitting upright in a chair. A man standing behind him supports his chin. Averbuch is already dead. </p> <p>Hemon's \"big book\" flips between two narratives: an imagining of the events around Averbuch's life and death; and a road story tracing the efforts of the writer Brik and his friend Rora, a photographer, to uncover Averbuch's world through visiting his birthplace in Kishinev (then in Russia, now in Moldova; the pair also decide to visit Ukraine, while they're at it, and fetch up in Sarajevo). Hemon made the same journey himself with his photographer friend Velibor Bozovic, who supplied some of the photographs that appear, uncaptioned, at the start of each chapter, further complicating the relationship between reporting and invention. Like all his books, The Lazarus Project has Hemon in it, but like all his books it resists any transformation into straightforward autobiography. Hemon is uninspired by what he calls \"the memoir craze\". \"I hate it beyond words. It's a crisis of the imagination,\" he says, looking wildly over my head, perhaps hoping to find a smarter reader up there. </p> <p>Despite his writhing, his tone is patient: the idea is important. \"The way I work, I start from the personal space, then expand outwards ... I'm everyone in my books. That's the whole fucking point.\"</p> <h2>Hemon on Hemon</h2> <p>\"Then there was silence. The electricity of violence and fear in the room. The down from torn pillows floating, like souls, through the fog of what had just happened. The air reeking of sweat and blood, of smashed furniture and shards of glass, of spilled food and fear ...</p> <p>A horse whinnied outside. The wind came in through the windows, but nothing inside moved.</p> <p>No one moved: Papa's face pressed against the floor in a puddle of blood; Mother lying on her side, facing the wall next to the kitchen door; Chaia curled up, her knees to her chest, the hem of her dress touching her ear; Roza on her back still; rivulets of blood spreading away from Lazarus's nose and eye sockets, across his cheeks and mouth, down to his neck.</p> <p>He is dead; they are all dead, I thought. The horrible fear rushed from my stomach to my head. They killed them all. Here it is, then.\"</p> <p>It's a furious book. In fact, it used to be more so but I've toned it down. Basically, I've been angry with America for the past eight years. It's part of a wider pattern of anger over the Bosnian war and war crimes. Some people sit and weep; I rage about the injustice of it all. </p> <p>If you write outside history, as so many novelists seem to do, then you end up writing confessional fiction, which I can't stand.

  "<p>The foreign secretary was yesterday given a week by the high court to defend his position over the government's refusal to disclose documents in the case of a British resident held as an alleged terrorist in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. </p> <p>The decision to allow David Miliband a further week to argue his case is the latest development in what is seen by lawyers as a precedent-setting case.</p> <p>Binyam Mohamed, 30, an Ethiopian who came to Britain as an asylum seeker in 1994, has claimed that there is evidence that torture was used against him to obtain a confession. His lawyers have argued that the government should make available any documentation connected to his incarceration and interrogation that could substantiate these claims. </p> <p>Yesterday Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones issued a judgment that gave Miliband until September 5 to make further submissions, in light of concessions made by the UK and US authorities this week. The court noted that there had been \"a significant and welcome change\" in the position taken by the US government over disclosure of information. The court heard earlier this week that 44 documents previously withheld were to be made available to the prosecuting authorities in the case.</p> <p>The judges added that there remained only one aspect of the case that failed to satisfy the requirements of Mohamed's defence team. \"In arriving at our final conclusions on public interest immunity and the discretion to order disclosure, it will be necessary to consider whether this is a legitimate requirement,\" they said.</p> <p>Mohamed's solicitor, Richard Stein, said: \"Today's judgment discloses the shocking fact that the foreign secretary failed to give any proper weight in secret submissions he made to the court to the abhorrence of torture when he purported to determine that it was in the public interest not to disclose the evidence of ill-treatment to our client.\"</p> <p>The organisation Reprieve, which has been representing Mohamed in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, said that Miliband had effectively been given a further week \"to get it right\". It added: \"The foreign secretary has balanced Mr Mohamed's right to a fair trial with the strong US desire that this information not be disclosed.\" In an email read out in court this week, a legal adviser to the US state department argued that any further disclosure would cause \"serious and lasting damage\" to security relations between the two countries.</p> <p>The Foreign Office said the court had recognised the \"strenuous efforts\" made on behalf of Mohamed. The government has lobbied the US to release all British residents from Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>Mohamed was detained in Pakistan in 2002 and secretly rendered to Morocco, where he claims he was tortured by having his penis cut with a razor blade. He was also detained and interrogated in Afghanistan before being taken to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in 2004, where he is awaiting trial.</p>",
  "<p>Parading their gold medals in front of the television cameras this week, Britain's Olympic champions wisely avoided talking about their monetary value. But behind the scenes, agents and corporate sponsors have kick-started negotiations which could transform Team GB's finest into millionaires.</p> <p>They might not expect the fortune awaiting Olympic swimming giant Michael Phelps - in line, according to his agent, to earn as much as \u00a350m - but most of Britain's gold medallists can hope to reach six figure sums through a combination of sponsorship deals and appearance fees. (Melted down, the medallion itself - made of silver coated with 6g (0.2oz) of gold - would not fetch much over \u00a3120.)</p> <p>\"This is the best performing British team since 1908, they're the golden team,\" said Nick Bitel, chief executive of the London marathon and a sports lawyer. \"That will elevate each of their value.\"</p> <p>The most ambitious among the returning champions is Chris Hoy, the triple gold medal track cyclist - marketable as Scotland's greatest Olympian. He is sponsored by eight companies, including BT, cycle and cycling equipment manufacturer Shimano and B&amp;Q. </p> <p>His agent, Ricky Cowan, said he was in discussion with blue chip companies about future backing, and two Scottish sponsors would be unveiled in the coming days. \"We're looking for four or five deals worth around \u00a3400,000 each,\" he said. \"Could there be a \u00a31m contract out there? Yes, probably. Could it get to \u00a32m in total? I'd like to think so.\"</p> <p>London 2012 sponsors such as British Airways, Lloyds TSB and EDF are also rumoured to be contemplating recruiting the cyclist as the \"ambassador\" for the next games. </p> <p>Second in line is Rebecca Adlington, the 19-year-old from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, who won two swimming golds to become the country's first success in the pool since 1988. Before the games, Adlington did not have a sponsor. The most optimistic industry insiders estimate that she can now expect to earn as much as \u00a31m - more than enough, it seems, to meet her needs. \"I most want to get a kit deal so that I don't keep buying equipment for swimming,\" she said when asked about sponsorship plans. \"I owe my parents a lot of money.\"</p> <p>Boxer James DeGale will expect a similar windfall - not from sponsorship, but from a lucrative move into the professional arena following in the steps of previous British Olympic successes, Amir Khan and Audley Harrison.</p> <p>\"The smart athletes should wait for the dust to settle,\" said Jonathan Marks, agent for four British gold medallists, including cyclist Bradley Wiggins. \"Brands are going to want to have a gold medallist in their portfolio in the run-up to 2012.\"</p> <p>Colin Grannell, who heads European marketing for Visa, which has been an Olympic partner since 1986, said there had been a shift from generally associating a brand with the games, to focusing on individual athletes. \"The whole point is that we want to take Visa to as many people as possible. The athletes can do that,\" he said. \"We help them and they help us.\" </p> <p>Visa, which now counts more than 90 athletes on its Team Visa books worldwide, will be selecting 2012 recruits in the coming months.</p> <p>Nigel Currie, director of marketing agency Brand Rapport, predicted that athletes can \"at least double\" their expectations because of opportunities linked to 2012. But he warned that for lesser-known athletes, Team GB's outstanding success could prove a mixed-blessing - diluting the individual value of a British gold.</p> <p>\"There's a slight lessening of the sponsorship because of the sheer number of gold medals we won, and the number of sportsmen and women involved,\" he said. </p> <p>The British Olympic Authority issues strict guidelines for athletes dictating, for example, which brand of sportswear and equipment athletes can use, and taking care not to offend official Olympic sponsors. The amount athletes receive through lottery funding is also means-tested, meaning the more they secure from corporate sponsors the less they receive in grants.</p> <p>But there is still money to be made in a market that often hinges on the profile of an athlete - and their sport. </p> <p>Christine Ohuruogu's brand has been tainted by the controversy over her missed drugs tests, agents said, but some still predict that the 400m winner will secure some of the biggest earnings. \"Someone like Christine, because she's an Olympic champion in athletics, can earn up to \u00a350,000 just for turning up to events,\" said Bitel. </p> <p>The athlete many agents agree could be the most commercially lucrative personality returning from Beijing failed to win any medal. As one agent put it, 14-year-old Tom Daley, who has charisma and good looks as well as sporting ability that belies his age, is \"the great marketing property\".</p> <p>The same cannot be said for victors of team sports such as rowing or sailing. When Sarah Webb, Sarah Ayton and Pippa Wilson combined efforts to sail to victory in an Yngling boat, for example, it earned them the dubious title \"three blondes in a boat,\" but not, say sponsorship experts, much more than \u00a3100,000 as reward.</p> <p>Another largely unknown gold medallist, canoeist Tim Brabants, was circumspect about his prospects, saying he would be happy to receive any financial assistance at all. A qualified doctor, Brabants is returning to an NHS casualty department to fund his way to London 2012. \"Until now [sponsorship] has been mainly clothes and food,\" he said. \"If it's free, I'll eat it.\"</p>",

  "<p>It may not have matched Denver's annual livestock show, which has been known to draw well over half a million, but the Democratic National Convention was still an extraordinary display of political theatre. Fifty thousand delegates and 15,000 members of the media descended on the city; 2,500 FBI agents and police patrolled the Pepsi Centre. Obama merchandise abounded; celebrities were spotted; Hillary Clinton supporters demonstrated, as did anti-war activists, though not in the numbers predicted. The air space above Denver was closed; taxis were like gold-dust; tempers frayed, and while Democrats healed, TV anchors fell out with each other, live on air. </p> <h2>Most historic moment</h2> <p>Obviously, the stirring bipartisan healing between Pepsi and Coke, one of which sponsored the venue while the other sponsored the massive recycling operation. But Barack Obama's open-air nomination speech, which made him the first ever African-American presidential candidate for a major US party, came pretty close. \"America, we cannot turn back,\" Obama told the tearful crowd, who later spoke of John F Kennedy, and Martin Luther King. Even John McCain released an ad acknowledging that it was a \"job well done\" - though he probably recorded the ad before the speech.</p> <h2>Worst misreading of Obama's speech</h2> <p>The Associated Press. While almost every other commentator, from left to right, dissected Obama's decision to focus on specifics, instead of lofty rhetoric, AP commentator Charles Babington heard a speech in which Obama, \"instead of dwelling on specifics, he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes ...\" Meanwhile, most cautious pre-speech headline was on CNN's website: \"Obama expected to address change in speech.\" No kidding.</p> <h2>Most absurd act of public therapy</h2> <p>Wednesday's staged roll-call vote, in which delegates got to voice support for Hillary Clinton, before Clinton herself \"spontaneously\" stepped forward to award the nomination to Obama.</p> <h2>Best recovery from a setback</h2> <p>New Mexico governor and former presidential candidate Bill Richardson, who got bumped from Wednesday's schedule, and had difficulty getting on to the convention floor because staff didn't recognise him, but who came back on Thursday to deliver this line: \"John McCain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes, but we'll all be paying for his flip-flops.\"</p> <h2>Best political rehabilitation</h2> <p>Democratic hero turned sore loser turned Democratic hero once more, Bill Clinton, who told delegates: \"People the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power.\"</p> <h2>Most inexplicable dentistry</h2> <p>Obama running-mate Joe Biden, who as we were regularly reminded takes the humble old train to work, and has a reported net worth of about $150,000 (\u00a382,000), yet still has the shiniest teeth American politics has ever seen, and that's saying a lot.</p> <h2>Most disappointing speech</h2> <p>Probably Michelle Obama's, because politics required her to present herself as a non-threatening first lady. You'd never have guessed she was a Harvard and Princeton grad with a knife-sharp sense of humour, though in a video prior to her address, she did recall first hearing of her future husband: \"Who names their kid Barack Obama? He must be weird.\" </p> <h2>Strangest interpretation of a speech</h2> <p>Puma PAC, one of the hardline pro-Clinton groups refusing to support Obama, who thought Clinton's invocation of Harriet Tubman in her endorsement of Obama (\"keep running!\") was a secret code meaning they should keep up their campaign</p>",
  "<p>Nearly lost amid the political hoopla of two presidential nominating conventions is a sombre milestone. Friday was the <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/katrina/\">third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's deadly strike</a> on the Gulf of Mexico coast, a catastrophe that nearly destroyed New Orleans and, with its aftermath of botched rescue efforts, has done more than anything but the Iraq war to discredit the Bush presidency. </p> <p>As if following some kind of karmic timetable, though, <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=us/0-0-0&amp;fp=48bb0bb37a8a36e1&amp;ei=V3y7SNP0LqXYQaOEkdAC&amp;url=http%3A//www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/09/01/gustav/&amp;cid=1241029694&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_4Ho6ft6iv__jXUzSomDa6MiPfA\"> Tropical Storm Gustav gathered strength</a> over the Caribbean and entered the Gulf. Forecasts indicate it will head toward Louisiana, meaning a possible deadly blow for New Orleans. The machinery of mass evacuations has cranked into motion across the Gulf coast. Fema and other federal agencies, having learned some lessons with Katrina, are <a href=\"http://www.thenewsstar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080828/UPDATES01/80828061\">pre-positioning aid and personnel</a>.</p> <p>And Republicans, whose convention to nominate John McCain for the presidency gets underway on Monday in St Paul, Minnesota, are panicking. White House officials say <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/08/28/bush-gustav-rnc/\">President Bush may opt out of his planned Monday speech</a>, and there's talk of <a href=\"http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2008/08/mccain-camp-gop.html\">postponing the convention altogether</a>. The potential spectacle of Republicans partying and launching political attacks on Barack Obama while a storm rains destruction on American communities would indeed hurt McCain's chances. It would seem callous - a Republican weakness to begin with - but also evoke images of the Katrina aftermath, when the Bush administration spent more time pinning blame on Democrats than on rescuing citizens trapped in flooded New Orleans.</p> <p>The fact that Republicans are concerned almost wholly with how things look, not the actual threat of the storm to life and property, isn't surprising. The fact is, America's leaders - Republican and Democrat - never really learned the lessons of Katrina. </p> <p>Katrina represented a failure of the government at all levels - not just in emergency management, but in the basic idea of government itself, protecting citizens from harm. In the decades before the storm hit, the US government embarked on an ambitious plan to protect New Orleans and its surrounding suburbs from hurricane storm surges. It managed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/hurricanekatrina.usa\">totally botch the job</a>. Not only was the new levee system a patchwork, full of gaps and shoddy construction, some floodwalls were built using faulty designs and fell down soon after the water rose. </p> <p>Moreover, as scientists learned more about hurricanes, it was clear by the 1980s that New Orleans would be destroyed if a hurricane hit it head-on, as floodwaters swamped its levees and filled the city like a soup bowl. Every summer, as new hurricanes roared over Gulf waters, the US played a game of hurricane roulette with one of its major cities. Yet nothing was done to address this mortal threat. Meanwhile, the city itself and its surrounding marshes were sinking into the sea, steadily opening it to greater risks.</p> <p>New Orleans is an excellent proxy for the broader challenges posed by global warming, which will mean rising seas and (probably) bigger, more dangerous storms. The deltaic landscape of south Louisiana is changing very fast, so the risks from storms and flooding are rising faster than flat-footed, special interest-dominated American institutions are able to handle. In the coming decades, there will be more New Orleanses in America and elsewhere around the world. </p> <p>Katrina provided an early warning, offering some valuable lessons on how to handle climate change. Protecting New Orleans from future storms would mean not only preserving a US city and a valuable cultural heritage. It would force institutions to reform and devise smarter policies that could be adapted to the coming challenges.<br> But New Orleans proved too politically marginal to get much attention from Washington, and protecting and rebuilding it - which ought to be a national priority - soon became a tertiary concern. The result: The levee system is being upgraded, at a cost of $13bn. But the upgrades only protect against relatively weak storms. We're still playing hurricane roulette.</p> <p>Forecasters say <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/weather/08/29/gustav/index.html\">Gustav will strengthen</a> to a Category 4 storm, with wind speeds between 131-155 mph (210-249 km/hr), and would easily overwhelm the levees if it comes close enough to the city. That could undo the past three years of rebuilding, and destroy what Katrina missed.</p> <p>This is bad for New Orleans, of course. I am sceptical, given that the institutions charged with protecting it are so weak and slow-moving, that the city will still be there a century from now. But more ominously still, this shows how fundamentally unready the US government is to tackle the coming challenges of climate change.</p>",
  "<p>The hostile reaction of the United States and the European Union to the Kremlin's move was predictable. Russian president Dmitry Medvedev anticipated that, and expressed his disdain. </p> <p>What he apparently did not anticipate was the disapproval by China, an ally in their joint opposition to the hegemony that the United States has enjoyed since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p> <p>The difference between the two powerful neighbours came to the fore at the annual summit of the six-member <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation\">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a> (SCO) in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe on Thursday. Medvedev <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia\">failed to convince</a> the other leaders that Moscow's actions were essential to prevent Tbilisi's aggression against South Ossetia. </p> <p>The SCO, originally known as the Shanghai Forum, was established in 1996 as a confidence-building regional organisation to defuse tension on the Sino-Soviet border. It initially consisted of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, with its headquarters in Shanghai. It then graduated to a regional body with a broader mandate for security, acquired Uzbekistan as its sixth member, changed its name to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and resorted to holding joint military exercises. </p> <p>The SCO's backing for the Kremlin's actions in South Ossetia and elsewhere in Georgia would have provided Medvedev with a powerful diplomatic tool to counter Western opposition, but he seems to have overlooked the \"concern\" Beijing <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/29/europe/29russia.php\">had expressed</a> over the Kremlin's action in Georgia before the SCO summit.</p> <p>Where the Chinese president seems to have taken an uncompromising stance at the Dushanbe summit is on the cardinal principle of the territorial integrity of a state. This has been one of the five pillars of China's foreign policy since the mid-1950s, called <em>panchsheel</em> (Five Principles). The others are: mutual non-aggression; mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful co-existence. It is in the light of the <em>panchsheel</em> that Beijing's recent moves in Sudan and Zimbabwe ought to be seen. </p> <p>At the SCO summit, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, sharing borders with Russia and China, would have backed the Chinese line strongly. Though the overall parity that ethnic Slavs, mainly Russians, enjoyed with ethnic Kazakhs on the eve of Kazakhstan's independence in 1991 no longer exists, some Kazakh areas adjoining Russia have a Slav majority. So, in future, that region could demand independence from Kazakhstan just as South Ossetia and Abkhazia did in the case of Georgia. </p> <p>As for China, the demand of many native <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_people\">Uighurs</a> in the vast Xinjiang province for independence has a long history. This is equally true of Tibet. Therefore it would have been unthinkable that Beijing would condone Moscow's recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Yet China shares its leadership of the SCO with Russia. So the communiqu\u00e9 issued by the summit in Dushanbe was a compromise. SCO presidents <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/29/europe/29russia.php\">reaffirmed</a> their commitment to \"efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity\" while expressing their approval of \"the active role of Russia in assisting in peace and cooperation in the region\". </p> <p>Taking their cue from the SCO summit, the policymakers in the Kremlin would be well advised to seek a compromise with the west by using its recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as a bargaining chip to secure a reversal of the west's earlier recognition of independence of Kosovo from Serbia. </p>",
  "<p>Picking the Alaska governor is a bold play from John McCain for the potentially millions of disaffected Hillary Clinton voters who have remained impervious to Democrats' pleas for party unity. She presents a new face unfamiliar to most of America, and is likely to stir up the race and excite the news media. </p> <p>At 44, she is a youthful addition to the Republican ticket. Sarah Palin is an avid angler and hunter, a member of the politically powerful National Rifle Association, and her husband has native-American roots. She is also a former runner-up in the Miss Alaska beauty contest.</p> <p>But Palin brings several risks. She has been in office less than two years, and would be hard pressed to go toe-to-toe in debate with Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden, a veteran senator and foreign policy expert.</p> <p>The Democrats will also raise questions about whether Palin passes the \"commander-in-chief test\" \u2014 that is, would she be able to assume the presidency should McCain, 72, become incapacitated. The news media may also seek to tie Palin to longtime Alaska Republican senator Ted Stevens, who is under indictment on corruption charges.</p> <p>Before taking office in December 2006, Palin served two terms as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, and was on the city's council before that. </p> <p>Her nomination poses an interesting choice for the US electorate between the country's first African-American president and its first woman vice-president. But she is not the first woman to be nominated for the post \u2014 that was Geraldine Ferraro, the Democratic nominee in 1984 (the year Palin entered Miss Alaska). </p> <p>Politically, Palin is a fiscal and social conservative, but has cultivated a reputation as a maverick and a reformer, and claims to have cut taxes while improving public services. In 2007 she vetoed 13% of Alaska's proposed budget for capital projects. Her popularity is riding high at the moment, with approval ratings of 80%. </p> <p>She differs with McCain over the issue of drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, although it is McCain's opposition to oil prospecting in Alaska that is probably more out of tune with the bulk of the party. </p> <p>Palin rose to attention in Alaska in 2003 while serving on the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, blowing the whistle on violations of state ethical regulations by Republican party leaders.<br> However, she is under investigation herself over allegations that she dismissed state public safety commissioner Walter Monegan because he would not sack a state trooper involved in an acrimonious divorce with her younger sister. Palin has told US television networks she has \"nothing to hide\".</p> <p>Palin eats moose burgers, goes ice fishing, rides snowmobiles, runs marathons, manages a hockey team and owns a seaplane, according to US reports. She is also a Christian.<br> Her husband Todd is a native American who works for oil giant BP and is also a commercial fisherman. Their eldest son, Track, joined the US army at the age of 18 as an infantryman and is due to be deployed to Iraq. </p> <p>She is staunchly anti-abortion. On learning she was pregnant with a child with Downs Syndrome, she went on to have the baby. Her second son, Trig Paxson Van Palin, was born in April this year. After his birth, she told reporters: \"I'm looking at him right now, and I see perfection. Yeah, he has an extra chromosome. I keep thinking, in our world, what is normal and what is perfect?\"</p> <p>Palin has a degree in journalism from the University of Idaho and worked in the media and the utilities industry before moving into politics 14 years ago.</p>",
  "<p>The gap between incomes in cities and the countryside has reached its<br>highest level in 30 years despite a rapid rise in rural earnings, the state<br>media has reported.</p> <p>China's agriculture minister told officials today that per capita income in the countryside rose by 10.3% in the six months to June and predicted the annual figures would break all records. Last year's 9.5% increase was the largest since 1985.</p> <p>Rising prices, migrant labourers sending money home from cities, and the growth of subsidies for farmers were all playing their part, added Sun<br>Zhengcai, quoted in China Daily.</p> <p>But he warned the future is uncertain because farming costs have risen<br>sharply and migrant workers face massive job losses because export-<br>oriented factories are cutting production or closing as the yuan<br>appreciates against other currencies.</p> <p>Rural incomes have risen markedly over the last few years, reaching 4,140 yuan (\u00a3330) per capita in 2007, compared to 13,786 yuan (\u00a31,100) in urban areas.</p> <p>But Sun told a meeting of officials that the ratio of urban to rural income<br>per capital reached 3.31:1 last year, the highest since economic reforms<br>began three decades ago.</p> <p>According to recent research by the World Bank, the number of Chinese<br>people living on less than $1 a day fell by more than 600m between 1981 and 2005.</p> <p>But that has left 106m struggling on a tiny income and concern is mounting about the gulf between city and countryside.</p> <p>In a paper published by the Nautilus Institute this week, Professor Yu<br>Jianrong of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Yu Debao, a<br>postgraduate student at Peking University, said many believed that the gap between rich and poor was one of the main contributors to \"mass incidents\".</p> <p>Around 60% of the Chinese population still live in the countryside, but<br>officials believe that the situation will be reversed within 20 years.</p>",
  "<p>Last night, Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">articulated</a> firmly and persuasively in a western Rocky Mountain state exactly what makes America unique in the western world - and how the Bush years have drawn us away from those ideals and ideas. \"America is better than the last eight years,\" he said, not for the first time, and he drew again, forcefully and beautifully, how is own narrative - the one he often calls \"unlikely\" - was possible only in America. <br> Those who have followed this election cycle closely might glaze over at those words by now. They've been used often enough. But last night Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/democrats2008.barackobama\">wove a powerful and convincing argument</a>, linking his and his family's Horatio Alger story with that of America and the America we want to live in, and convincingly, and without hesitation, underscored all the ways that the Bush administration has worked to fray that version of the American dream.</p> <p>Without talking about race - and in the weeks to come we may quibble about his omissions as well as inclusions - he drew all of America into the struggle for civil rights. Without harping on whipped-up (and in my opinion entirely falsely constructed) anxieties about heterosexual marriage, he gave the smartest most succinct line that any major politician has given on why gay men and lesbians shouldn't be relegated to second-class citizenship.</p> <p>Without becoming mired in a debate on the moment life begins, he highlighted the issue that all thinking men and women should focus on in the abortion debate: ending unwanted pregnancies. Without over promising government intervention, he drew a clear line back to Franklin Roosevelt and policies that ensured that Americans should care for the weakest in society and thus buoy us all. Without resorting to xenophobia, he underscored the need for healthy immigration policies. And without overpromising, he drew a firm line against isolationism and toward a healthier foreign policy using the words of Martin Luther King: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.constitutionandcivilliberties\">\"We cannot walk alone.\"</a> <br> In the last several years, I've spent the majority of my time reporting from Europe. The reputation of my country, as Guardian readers are well aware, has suffered tremendously over this period. And yet, again and again since 2003, when the US first went into Iraq, I would try to explain to Europeans that, despite the Bush administration, there is tremendous privilege to carrying an American passport.</p> <p>That there was a reason my family felt hugely lucky to come to America when it did, in 1938, as war was darkening Europe and persecution had begun to blight the continent. That sense of joy in becoming Americans had been passed down to me, three generations on, and even my dismay at the Bush/Cheney years hadn't dulled my sense of responsibility to that passport, to the privileges that it bestowed upon me, the sense of unconstrained possibility that came with being born in New York. <br> Last night, Obama made the case for why Americans can't sit back if we want to preserve those freedoms and those possibilities. He highlighted what is left to be done \u2013 for workers, for women, for people of colour, for the uninsured, for the less fortunate \u2013 in order to uphold that dream, as cheesy as the idea of a dream can seem. Obama reignited a sense of unified purpose and shared responsibility, that truly American sentiment, more forcefully than anyone has in my political adulthood. And standing there on that stage in Denver, he set the stage for a dramatic and purposeful fight about what the future of America needs to be. Bring it on, indeed.</p>",
  "<p> <strong>By Robert Andrews</strong></p> <p><strong>Facebook</strong> plans to double its UK sales and marketing staff to about 40 as part of its launch last week of new \"engagement ads\", <strong>MarketingWeek</strong> says, noting the new staff will \"encourage digital agencies and brands\" to use the new formats. It won't be a traditional ad sales job, that's for sure - the new recruits will have to persuade clients to be community-centric with the new ads, which will let users add comments, give virtual gifts and become \"fans\" of brands. The new staff will come under European commercial director <strong>Blake Chandlee</strong>, who remains Facebook's UK top dog.</p> <p>It's all part of the ongoing quest to effectively marry advertising with social media. Forrester analyst <strong>Jeremiah Owyang</strong>, who was briefed on the new engagement ads last week, said click-through rates of the standard ads were \"dismal\". Despite the promise of leveraging social profile data and the interactive paradigm to create insanely hypertargeted ads, Facebook struggled on privacy grounds with its advanced <strong>Beacon</strong> programme; <strong>eMarketer</strong> has cut forecasts for social media ad spending as the networks find the whole thing harder than expected. Owyang: \"Currently unproven, brands may not be ready for these types of new ads, until they change how they measure success.\"</p> <p><strong>From <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org\">paidContent</a>:</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-napster-were-open-to-a-sale-vote-no-on-the-ice-cream-franchisee/\">Napster: 'We're open to a sale'; vote no on the ice cream franchisee</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-microsoft-beats-out-quadrangle-to-buy-online-research-firm-gr/\">Microsoft beats Quadrangle to buy research firm Greenfield for $486m; selling off most of it</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-first-results-of-canoe-ventures-promo-muscle-still-puny-more-about-work/\">First results of Canoe Ventures promo muscle still puny; more about working together</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-amazon-no-new-kindle-this-year/\">Amazon: no new Kindle this year; 'sometime next year earliest'</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-comcast-to-roll-out-monthly-usage-cap/\">Comcast to roll out monthly usage cap</a></p> <p><strong>From <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk\">paidContent:UK</a>:</strong></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-kangaroo-says-cartel-concerns-misconceived-targets-11-percent-of-uk-vod/\">Kangaroo says cartel concerns 'misconceived', targets 11% of UK VOD market</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-mailru-buys-third-of-russian-date-site-mamba/\">Mail.ru buys third of Russian date site Mamba</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-earnings-hi-media-misses-forecast-fotolog-breaks-even/\">Earnings: Hi-Media misses forecast, Fotolog breaks even</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-industry-moves-hobson-for-kangaroo-endemol-portugal-md/\">Industry Moves: Hobson for Kangaroo, Endemol Portugal MD</a></p>",
  "<p>1. Michael Jackson filed a patent application for the \"leaning forward a bit\" dance moves displayed in the Smooth Criminal video.</p> <p>2. The book Michael Jackson Was My Lover features a picture that \u2013 purportedly \u2013 depicts Michael Jackson's cock. In the picture, it resembles a plump mushroom.</p> <p>3. The Moby remix of Beat It was quite good.</p> <p>4. American rap act Plastic Little have a single called Cheap Thrills coming out quite soon \u2013 it's based around Herve's club track of the same name and comes with a massive Thriller sample in it. The song is, for the avoidance of doubt, quite brilliant.</p> <p>5. It is possible to recreate the seminal \"Jacko stamping and holding on to trees\" finale of the Earth Song video in any doorway.</p> <p>6. Mark Ronson once admitted that, years ago, he tried to watch pornography with Michael Jackson. Sean Lennon was there too.</p> <p>7. In their Calvin Harris-produced but not-as-big-as-Michael Jackson Dance Wiv Me track, the Mitchell Brothers noted that \"the only thing missing was the glove. But that didn't stop me strutting my stuff, Kick my legs out, clutch me hat\".</p> <p>8. When Michael Jackson released Liberian Girl, Smash Hits magazine went out on to the streets of London to see if Your Average Punter could locate Liberia on a globe. One of the people they bumped into was the Rebel MC.</p> <p>9. Rod Temperton, who wrote a load of Thriller, is from Cleethorpes. Other famous people to have come from Cleethorpes include the actress Patricia Hodge and the bassist from Saxon, neither of whom have written songs for Michael Jackson.</p> <p>10. The flute on Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' was played by Larry Williams. The \"mama se mama sa\" business in the song was recently sampled by Rihanna (on Don't Stop the Music), although when Michael included those lyrics in his own version he ended up being sued for copyright infringement by Manu Dibango, and settled out of court.</p> <p>11. Invincible cost $30m to make, putting the unit cost of each copy sold at $30m (ok, so it didn't really only sell one copy but it was hardly the big seller some were hoping for, along with the Spice Girls album Forever, which set Rodney Jerkins's career back a bit.)</p> <p>12. When Michael is shopping in France for ingredients to make an omelette, he doesn't stop 'til he gets un oeuf. When he gets the egg home, he beats it. Other things he can cook include rock cakes with you, hummus nature, and she's outta my loaf.</p> <p>13. Michael Jackson often carries an umbrella. He likes to be in the shade.</p> <p>14. He is family, he's got all his brothers with him. One of Michael's brothers is called Tito. Tito was a member of the Jackson 5 with Michael, Jermaine, Jackie, Marlon and Randy.</p> <p>15. One of his brothers is called Jermaine. Jermaine was a member of the Jackson 5 with Michael, Tito, Jackie, Marlon and Randy.</p> <p>16. One of his brothers is called Jackie. Jackie was a member of the Jackson 5 with Michael, Jermaine, Tito, Marlon and Randy.</p> <p>17. One of his brothers is called Marlon. Marlon was a member of the Jackson 5 with Michael, Jermaine, Jackie, Tito and Randy.</p> <p>18. One of his brothers is called Randy. Randy was a member of the Jackson 5 with Michael, Jermaine, Jackie, Marlon and Tito.</p> <p>19. He also has a sister, called LaToya. LaToya was not a member of the Jackson 5 with Michael, Jermaine, Jackie, Marlon, Tito and Randy.</p> <p>20. There's another sister, called Janet. Janet is a popular singing artist too, although her last few albums have been rubbish.</p> <p>21. His age, incidentally, is 50. Hence these 50 amazing facts. Other singers to be 50 this year include Madonna, Prince, Kate Bush and Ice-T. If one were to put them in order of who had grown old the most gracefully, Michael would be one place below Madonna.</p> <p>22. Artists to have sung Michael's songs include Ian Brown (Billie Jean), Blackstreet (Billie Jean) and the Flying Pickets (Billie Jean). </p> <p>23. More artists to have covered Michael Jackson songs include Ashanti (Rock With You), Alien Ant Farm (Smooth Criminal) and Boyzone (Ben).</p> <p>24. Michael has covered songs by the Beatles (Come Together), Floetry (Butterflies) and Jackie Wilson (Lonely Teardrops).</p> <p>25. Back in the kitchen, other things you'll find in the Jacko larder include cherry bakewell my summer love, flan in the mirror, and you are not a scone. He also likes to sprinkle his meals with herbs, although this only works if he remembers the thyme.</p> <p>26. He didn't actually sleep in an oxygen tent, that was made up.</p> <p>27. Jacko once phoned Adam Ant to ask him where he got his jacket from, but Adam Ant thought it was one of his mates taking the piss and hung up. Hung Up was a 2006 hit for Madonna. Coincidence?</p> <p>28. Michael's hair caught fire once.</p> <p>29. Michael's middle name is Joseph.</p> <p>30. Michael's dad's name is Joseph.</p> <p>31. Joseph was sometimes a bit mean to his kids. On one occasion he donned murderin' burglar \"attire\" and broke into Michael's bedroom while Michael was asleep, to teach him a Very Important Lesson about not leaving the window open. Joseph Jackson did not hold any truck with the concept of \"it being a bit stuffy\".</p> <p>32. Sometimes Michael cries.</p> <p>33. The old child abuse business kicked off on the weekend of the Reading festival. Headlining act New Order changed the lyrics of True Faith to \"when I was a very small boy, Michael Jackson played with me\". For the avoidance of doubt we should point out that Michael Jackson never sexually abused mild-mannered New Order frontman Bernard Sumner.</p> <p>34. Thriller has sold in excess of 12 copies. In fact, Wikipedia reckons it's sold between 47\u2013108m copies worldwide, which proves that you can't trust Wikipedia when it comes to counting. </p> <p>35. Michael Jackson shares a birth date with TV funnyman Lenny Henry.</p> <p>36. Thriller opens with the words, \"Due to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that this film in no way endorses a belief in the occult\".</p> <p>37. Even to this day, the bit in Thriller when Michael looks up and growls \"RUN AWAY!!!!\" will still make you shit yourself. Bonus fact: the Thriller video is the last recorded instance of Michael Jackson looking really hot.</p> <p>38. Michael likes to be called The King of Pop.</p> <p>39. The best-ever Jacko-related imagery does not, in fact, feature Michael Jackson: it is a photograph of an over-emotional woman releasing a white dove when he was acquitted in 2005. A DOVE! Michael Jackson fans are notoriously loopy.</p> <p>40. Michael was friends with Macaulay Culkin. Culkin shot to fame in Home Alone, a film about a pre-teen boy plagued by grown men forcing their way in round the back. (One intruder gets his hand burnt on a knob.)</p> <p>41. Michael Jackson suffers from vitiligo. Much-loved comedian Bob Monkhouse also suffered from vitiligo.</p> <p>42. Punchlines to Michael Jackson jokes include \"when the big hand touches the little hand\" and \"you're scared? I'm walking home alone!\".</p> <p>43. Quincy Jones \u2013 quite a good producer.</p> <p>44. One of the best songs to sample a Michael Jackson song is SWV's Right Here, which nicks a bit of Human Nature. Another song to sample Human Nature is Jason Nevins and Holly James's I'm in Heaven.</p> <p>45. The best ever Michael Jackson song is Man in the Mirror.</p> <p>46. Famous people to have appeared in Michael Jackson videos include Naomi Campbell, Eddie Murphy and Michael Jackson.</p> <p>47. You can say what you like about Michael Jackson but if, tomorrow, he announced that he'd be at the O2 Arena performing Thriller in its entirety with a hundred dancers and a big smoke machine you'd be there like a shot.</p> <p>48. EXCLUSIVE FACT!!! The Streets' Mike Skinner's favourite thing about Michael Jackson is: \"There was this session bassist who did a show at Edinburgh, just talking about his life and experiences, and he told a story about how he was booked to play some stuff on a Michael Jackson album. Michael wasn't in the studio, but between takes the producer would look to one side in the control before saying yes or no \u2026 It turned out he was taking his cues from Michael Jackson, who was hiding under the mixing desk.\" Bonus fact: Mike Skinner cannot believe that Michael Jackson is 50.</p> <p>49. Back to Jacko's kitchen. Other things you'll find there include rockin robin, some off the Wall's ice cream, wanna be apple tartin' somethin', and the girl is mince. You'll also find a little red courgette \u2013 he borrowed that from Prince.</p> <p>50. He's bad.</p>",
  "<p>Opposition to Russia's recognition of the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia has been almost universal, even among its friends and allies. The G7 nations have accused Moscow of breaking international law. The EU is considering sanctions. And, most significantly, China has failed to endorse Russia's actions.</p> <h2>What are the Chinese saying and why?</h2> <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tajikistan, which brought together Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, a final statement gave the Kremlin little comfort: \"We express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the South Ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully, through dialogue, and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks.\"</p> <p>Analysts say China wants to avoid any anti-western gestures and, with its own restive ethnic minorities, showing any support for separatism.</p> <h2>How has Russia reacted to the criticism?</h2> <p>Defiantly. The prime minister, Vladimir Putin, went on CNN to accuse the US of provoking the conflict by arming the Georgian army, and suggested that this was part of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/russia.georgia\">election ploy</a> to help the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, in his campaign for the White House. \"Russia does not feel isolated and is not afraid to be isolated,\" said the Russian ambassador in Brussels.</p> <h2>What could happen next?</h2> <p>The first significant development will be at the emergency summit of the EU on Monday, when discussion of sanctions will be on the table. These could include a visa ban on officials from the breakaway regions, a ban on Russian property investment in Europe or the postponement of new partnership accord talks between Moscow and the EU, which are scheduled for September 15. </p> <h2>Will the EU go that far?</h2> <p>While some of the former Soviet countries have pushed for a firm response, others such as Germany, Italy and France \u2013 which brokered the peace plan \u2013 want to keep lines of communication open and constructive. There will be more condemnation of Russia's \"illegitimate\" action and moves to provide humanitarian aid to Georgia. </p> <h2>What of the speech by the British foreign secretary, David Miliband, in Ukraine about building a \"coalition against Russian aggression\"?</h2> <p>It has not been well received, particularly because many Ukrainians have no wish to join Nato. They do want to join the EU, which has yet to give a pledge of future membership. The Financial Times commented in an <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f4a72d5e-752e-11dd-ab30-0000779fd18c.html\">editorial</a> today: \"Brussels must now summon up the courage to offer a positive response.\"</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson's campaign promise to protect London's architectural heritage and its neighbourhoods' characters was a significant part of his election pitch. </p> <p>By pledging to prevent new tall buildings from towering, uninvited, over cowering communities or spoiling the capital's skyline he spoke to powerful conservative sentiments about tradition and also signalled a contrast with the readiness of Ken Livingstone to collaborate with trendy architects and charmless property developers. Under his leadership, Johnson claimed, structures with lofty ambitions would be permitted to sprout and congregate only in aesthetically and socially acceptable locations. </p> <p>Already there are cries of betrayal. Some have come from east London, close to <a href=\"http://www.friendsofqueensmarket.org.uk/\">West Ham football club, where a local campaign group</a> has upbraided Johnson for giving a barely qualified green light to a 31-storey tower that would be part of the proposed redevelopment of the local <a href=\"http://www.newqueensmarket.co.uk/\">Queen's Market</a>. </p> <p>I should admit to being biased: I own a set of green, see-through dinner plates of the type <a href=\"http://www.45-rpm.org.uk/dirt/tommys.htm\">Tommy Steele</a> would have eaten egg and chips off in his heyday, which I bought from the market many years ago. But Johnson's hands-off attitude to the proposed development does appear to be at odds with the principles he previously espoused. </p> <p>A higher profile \u2013 and higher physically \u2013 example is, according to Johnson's critics, his capitulation to a proposed <a href=\"http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2743\">43-storey tower of luxury apartments in Doon Street on the South Bank</a>, behind the National Theatre. Approved under Livingstone, it was \"called in\" by the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, for a public inquiry, but given the go-ahead by her earlier this month despite the objections of her own planning officers and <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.14316\">English Heritage</a>. </p> <p>Johnson had very little chance of stopping this. The inquiry had taken place by the time he became mayor and, although he could have reversed Livingstone's decision before Blears's findings were announced, it would have cut no ice with her and risked accusations of costly gesture politics. </p> <p>As a spokesperson for Johnson put it, \"it is not possible for the new mayor to reopen the matter without exposing London taxpayers to significant legal and financial risk.\" Nonetheless, it's a gesture some believe Johnson should have made. Writing in the London Evening Standard, the mayor's erstwhile supporter <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23544589-details/Our%20city%20doesn't%20need%20this%20nightmare%20on%20Doon%20Street/article.do?expand=true#StartComments\">Simon Jenkins described this as Johnson failing his \"first test\" as \"an emphatic city mayor\"</a>.</p> <p>The mayor's office reiterated that Johnson, \"has pledged to review London's planning policies including those relating to affordable housing and tall buildings\". Furthermore\u2013 though only after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/boris.london\">one heck of a fashion</a> \u2013 he has the experienced former Westminster council leader Sir Simon Milton to assist him. But the Queen's Market and Doon Street controversies both demonstrate in their different ways that matching pledges on urban planning with effective and consistent policies is no straightforward matter. </p> <p>They also show that a failure to do so where tall buildings are concerned can excite political passions as high as the buildings themselves.</p>",
  "<p>What do I think of when I think of Pakistan? I see the dusty mosques of Multan, the chaotic illegal markets in Peshawar where you can buy everything from a fake Rolex to an AK-47, the ruins at Taxila, the temple at Katas, the food at Cooco's Den with the Badshahi Mosque providing the backdrop and the Persian couplet on Anarkali's tomb: \"Could I see again the face of my lost friend, I would thank my God until the day of Judgment.\"</p> <p>Most of all, I remember a family. On my first tour in 2004 I often shared a room with Osman Samiuddin, a fine young writer who had yet to decide whether to cover cricket full-time. Two years later, by which time he was editor of Cricinfo in Pakistan, I stayed with his family in Karachi and with his brother-in-law, Murtaza, in Lahore. Apart from our old house in the north of England and my grandmother's place in Kerala, it was the only time that I've ever felt at home.</p> <p>Between playing with Osman's nieces and laughing at some of Murtaza's more risqu\u00e9 jokes, there was no time to feel homesick, even though it was a bitterly cold winter. When I fancied a quieter time, I would stay at home and chat to his father, whose observations about partition and life in India in the 1950s taught me far more than a decade of poorly written textbooks ever had.</p> <p>The decision to postpone the Champions Trophy \u2013 let's be honest and say that the chances of it ever being held in Pakistan now are as remote as BATE Borisov winning the Champions League \u2013 means that I will have to wait a few more months to cross the border again. But this isn't about personal disappointment; it's about how an entire nation has been stereotyped and isolated.</p> <p>When I first heard the news, I wanted to know what Osman thought of the decision. By far the most eloquent voice on matters pertaining to Asian cricket, he didn't disappoint. \"What more could Pakistan have done?\" he asked in his column. \"Nothing. The security arrangements, by many accounts, were outstanding. FICA's [the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations] chief is supposed to have told the PCB [Pakistan Cricket Board] that they were the best arrangements he had seen. The Asia Cup was held recently without so much as a beep on the many metal detectors and scanners placed at stadiums. No, the question is not what Pakistan could have done, for they did everything.\"</p> <p>If you tell a lie enough times, people will believe it to be the gospel. The decision not to play in Pakistan wasn't really about security. Not one Indian player spoke of being under siege during the recent Asia Cup, and these are citizens of a country that has fought four wars with Pakistan and still squabbles over disputed territory in Kashmir. To imagine that a Ricky Ponting or a Hamish Marshall would be a more attractive target than Sachin Tendulkar for some clueless Jihadi is to reduce yourself to the intellectual level of those who envision 72 Ana Ivanovic clones waiting for them in heaven should they strap some RDX to their belts and blow themselves up with a timer.</p> <p>No, the decision to isolate Pakistan has far more to do with it not being \"fun\", with the players' every step shadowed by army commandos and police. It is the sort of place where the PlayStation brigade that lacks the imagination to explore comes down with the mysteriously named (given the opulence of the five-star hotel rooms they stay in) Cabin Fever.</p> <p>Please note that Australia and England are due to play Test matches in Bangalore and Ahmedabad, where there were serial bomb blasts not so long ago. Will they pull out of those games? Will they heck. No player with an interest in his bank account will refuse an Indian tour, leave alone complain about the arrangements. There are compensations too, in the form of multiple endorsement deals, lavish parties thrown by the likes of Vijay Mallya and plenty of attention from Bollywood starlets and models. What's not to like?</p> <p>One of Australia's finest cricket writers was supposed to be in Pakistan to cover the Champions Trophy, and he minced no words when I asked him what he thought of the decision. \"The attitude of the players is shameful,\" he told me. \"When they speak off the record, they're so fucking disrespectful of other countries. Many of them are complete xenophobes.\"</p> <p>That's of little consolation to Pakistanis right now. A mediocre team has yet to recover from the first-round World Cup exit and the death of Bob Woolmer, and the fact that they won't play any Tests in 2008 is a shameful indictment of a Future Tours Programme that seems to cater only to Australia, India, England and South Africa. As Osman wrote: \"Pakistan needed to host the Champions Trophy, the second most important ODI tournament in the game, to put some feelgood back in the air, an opportunity to show that it still matters. Pakistan needed to show itself - and see itself - in headlines that didn't have the words 'terrorist' and 'Al-Qaeda' in them.\"</p> <p>A tri-series has been mooted for South Africa in September with Sri Lanka as the third team, but that will be little consolation to Pakistani fans who were looking forward to the arrival of the world's finest. For them, there is nothing to get excited about now until India arrive in early 2009.</p> <p>It just makes you wonder how different the scenario might have been if Stephen Waugh was captain of Australia. No one did more to get rid of the arrogant and ignorant \"Done-the-poverty-done-the-elephants-time-to-go-home\" mindset that habitually accompanied teams that came to the subcontinent. My Australian friend admitted as much. \"There's been a real regression in players' attitudes in the last few years,\" he said. \"Under Waugh, there was an element of curiosity about foreign countries and cultures. But these young blokes couldn't care less. They're rich, dense and think of nothing other than themselves.\"</p> <p>If you saw those words in isolation, you could easily convince yourself that you were reading about the English football team. Maybe cricket is the new football after all. It is nothing to be proud of.</p>",

  "<h2><a name=\"mccain\">On John McCain</a></h2> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90% of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90% of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on healthcare and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners\".</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle class as someone making under $5m a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million Americans? How else could he offer a healthcare plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the ownership society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No healthcare? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <h2><a name=\"foreignpolicy\">On foreign policy</a></h2> <p>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the gates of hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government, and even the Bush administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79bn surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future.</p> <h2><a name=\"economy\">On the economy</a></h2> <p>We Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23m new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honours the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <h2><a name=\"taxes\">On taxes</a></h2> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class.</p> <h2>On fuel</h2> <p>For the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and John McCain has been there for 26 of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies retool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150bn over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and 5m new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <h2><a name=\"education\">On education</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <h2><a name=\"healthcare\">On healthcare</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. If you have healthcare, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <h2><a name=\"pensions\">On pensions</a></h2> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.</p> <h2><a name=\"abortion\">On abortion</a></h2> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.</p> <h2>On gun control</h2> <p>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.</p> <h2>On same-sex marriages</h2> <p>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.</p> <h2>On immigration</h2> <p>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <h2>On individual responsibility</h2> <p>We must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength\". Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programmes alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <h2>On equal pay</h2> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <h2><a name=\"patriotism\">On patriotism</a></h2> <p>What I will not do is suggest that the senator [McCain] takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <h2><a name=\"background\">On his background</a></h2> <p>In the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbour, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mum, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p> <h2>On change</h2> <p>I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <h2>On the American spirit</h2> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p>",
  "<p>Tropical Storm Gustav today drenched Jamaica and threatened the Cayman Islands as the US Gulf coast made preparations to be hit by a possible hurricane next week.</p> <p>Gustav ripped off roofs, downed power lines and pounded rain into Jamaica, triggering landslides and flooding but no reported deaths. At least 68 people died earlier when the storm hit Haiti and the Dominican Republic. </p> <p>If Gustav continues its current trajectory, the storm could hit Louisiana \u2014 perhaps as a major hurricane \u2014 by next Tuesday, although it could wind up almost anywhere in the Gulf of Mexico, the US National Hurricane Centre in Miami said today.</p> <p>The storm was centred near Jamaica's western coast today, with its maximum sustained winds clocked at almost 65mph (100 kmph), the hurricane centre said.</p> <p>Forecasters said Gustav could reach hurricane strength before slamming into Grand Cayman later today and into the western tip of Cuba tomorrow. </p> <p>In the Cayman Islands, some hotels closed and those that remained open encouraged guests to leave. Theresa Foster, one of the owners of the Grand Caymanian Resort, said Gustav did not look as threatening as Hurricane Ivan, which destroyed 70% of Grand Cayman's buildings four years ago. </p> <p>\"Whatever was going to blow away has already blown away,\" she said. </p> <p>Jamaica has evacuated low-lying areas, closed the capital's main airport and halted bus services even as people streamed into supermarkets for emergency supplies. </p> <p>Fears that Gustav could hurt Gulf oil production sent oil prices soaring above $120 a barrel this week, before settling at US$115.59 yesterday. But they were creeping up again today, jumping past $116 a gallon. </p> <p>The Gulf has 4,000 oil rigs and half of America's refining capacity. Hundreds of offshore workers have already been pulled out and analysts said the storm could send US gas prices back over $4 a gallon. </p> <p>\"You're going to see increases by 5, 10, 15 cents a gallon,\" said Tom Kloza, publisher of the Oil Price Information Service in Wall, New Jersey. \"If we have a Katrina-type event, you're talking about gas prices going up another 30%.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, still well out in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Hanna continued to head westward, with forecasters warning it might pose a threat to the Bahamas by the middle of next week. It had sustained winds near 50 mph (85 kmph). Little change in strength is expected today, but the hurricane centre said Hanna could become a hurricane in the next few days. </p> <p>Forecasters cautioned that the path of Gustav \u2014 like that of most hurricanes \u2014 remained uncertain. </p> <p>\"It is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when Gustav will make final landfall,\" said Richard Knabb of the hurricane centre. \"The chances of hurricane-force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the Florida Panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of Louisiana.\" </p> <p>But with Hurricane Katrina's third anniversary falling today, Louisiana was not taking any chances and governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency. Texas Governor Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration, and both men put 8,000 National Guard troops on standby. </p> <p>New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin said he would order a mandatory evacuation of the city if forecasters predict a Category 3 strike \u2014 or even a Category 2 \u2014 within 72 hours. Both Jindal and Nagin were meeting with the US homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, later today. </p> <p>John McCain's spokesman said yesterday that Republican presidential candidate might postpone his party's national convention, due to start on Monday in St Paul, Minnesota, if the Gustav hit the US Gulf coast as a hurricane. </p> <p>At least 59 people died in Haiti from floods, mudslides and falling trees, including 25 around the city of Jacmel, where Gustav first struck land on Tuesday. Eight more people were buried when a cliff gave way in the Dominican Republic.</p> <p>Gustav is the first serious Atlantic storm since the 2005 hurricane season to threaten New Orleans and the 4,000 US energy platforms in the Gulf.</p> <p>Hurricanes Katrina and Rita destroyed 124 platforms and severed pipelines when they swept through the Gulf of Mexico. Katrina came ashore near New Orleans on August 29, 2005, as a Category 3 hurricane and flooded the city. It killed 1,500 people along the Gulf Coast and caused $80bn in damage. </p> <p>\"I'm panicking,\" said Evelyn Fuselier of Chalmette, whose home was submerged in 14 feet (4 meters) of Katrina's floodwaters. \"I keep thinking, 'Did the Corps fix the levees?,' 'Is my house going to flood again?' (...) 'Am I going to have to go through all this again?\"'</p>",
  "<p>After narrowly avoiding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/30/turkey.nato1\">being shut down</a> by the judiciary for undermining the secular freedoms guaranteed by the constitution, the ruling Islamic party in Turkey, the AKP, has become extremely nervous of introducing any legislation that appears to advance the religious agenda. A protection of youth bill that contained anti-porn measures was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/14/islam.religion\">hastily dumped</a> after an outcry from secular forces. </p> <p>In the context of the debates on pornography that take place in the UK, it seemed odd that the Turkish government had to stake its claim of being secular by adopting a libertarian position on pornography. Here, the debate is sharply divided between libertarians, who argue that pornography is the business of consenting adults, and not that of the state, and feminists, who oppose pornography on the grounds that it degrades women. </p> <p>The law might seem an attractive tool in the fight against pornography because it signals what is unacceptable to society. Of course, British feminists recognise that the banning of pornography can be problematical, not merely because the dividing line between pornography and erotica is so fluid, but because it vests too much power in the state. Historically, such legislation has been used more broadly than intended to crack down on any sexually explicit material, often lesbian and gay material, without regard to whether it is exploitative. It is because of the dangers posed by a powerful state that Turkish feminists, whose views have so far gone unreported, are opposed to the bill.</p> <p>Meltem Arikan, a Turkish <a href=\"http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Disturbing-family-order\"> writer and feminist</a>, felt the heavy hand of the state when her book, Don't Hurt My Flesh, based on interviews with children who had experienced incest and abuse at home, was banned in 2004 under legislation designed to protect children from pornography. She had to defend the book in court before the ban was lifted. She believes that the protection of youth bill should have been called the policing of youth bill, because its provisions are designed to monitor and restrict the movements of young people. The bill proposed, for instance, that unaccompanied under-18s should not be allowed into restaurants after 10pm; true protection of young people would require the government to take steps towards prevention of abuse within the family. As far as the religious establishment is concerned, the family is sacrosanct, and any investigation into incest is out of bounds. Arikan suspects:</p> <blockquote> <p>The government wants to use the protection of youth as an excuse to attack secularism, which was established in Turkey around 80 years ago. Therefore, feminists of Turkey, who are aware of the secret purpose of the government, are against the law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, new legislation in the UK, the <a href=\" ww.justice.gov.uk/publications/criminal-justice-bill.htm\"> Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008</a>, makes it an offence to be in possession of images of extreme pornography. It remains to be seen whether there will be a consensus on what constitutes \"extreme\". And whether a more liberal state can be trusted to make judgments that protect women from degradation. </p> <p>Given the different alignment of social and political forces here, the anti-porn campaign has made feminists uneasy bedfellows with the religious lobby, which opposes porn on grounds of morality. The feminist agenda is, of course, quite distinct. We need to carve out a space for women to express our sexuality, distinct from constructions of women's sexuality by exploitative industries such as porn or prostitution, or the controlling strictures of religion.</p>",
  "<p>A couple of weeks ago the <strong>New Statesman</strong> asked its readers to <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2008/08/british-investigation-party\">vote on the subject for the magazine's next investigation</a>. It was probably right to call this \"a unique experiment in British journalism\" for two reasons. The obvious one is in allowing readers to participate. The other was in tipping off the subject of the inquiry.</p> <p>The magazine not only suggested five possible topics for investigation but, in providing headlines, betrayed the angle it planned to pursue. So a probe into Conservative party funding was tagged \"The darker side of Dave\".</p> <p>The other four were the domination of political lobbying by giant multinational PR companies (\"The nuclear charm offensive\"); the (alleged) influence and meddling of <strong>Prince Charles</strong> (\"God save the queen. Beware the heir\"); the state of British childhood (\"A new deal for British children\"); and the asylum crisis due to the government's crackdown on asylum seekers (\"Work and amnesty are answer to asylum disarray\").</p> <p>As I write, asylum is far and away the favoured topic, having won 85% support, compared to 9% for lobbying and 2% each for the other three.</p> <p>Some of the readers' own suggestions are hilarious. Some are surreal (\"The real purpose of the DNA data base and the master race/programmed death/birth\"). One was rather sinister, urging an investigation into \"the power of the Jewish lobby in British politics and media\". Disturbingly, this attracted a measure of support from a couple of commenters, one of whom wrote that Jews \"do seem to have disproportionate power in economic and social affairs\".</p> <p>This prompted the New Statesman's political editor, <strong>Martin Bright</strong>, to reply: \"The influence of the Jewish lobby is pure anti-Semitism.\" The thread then disintegrated into a puerile bout of point-scoring between people who may well not be readers of the New Statesman anyway.</p> <p>But, as an experiment, it may still have some merit. What it reveals is that asylum is as hot a topic among liberals as among conservatives. Well, possibly. One of the problems with such online polls is that no-one really knows who is taking part. Rogue <strong>Spectator</strong> readers may be voting in droves, for example.</p> <p>Anyway, we can presumably look forward now to the forthcoming NS \"investigation\" into asylum seekers, though we know the outcome already: work and amnesty will cure the problem. Over to you then, Mr Bright. Probe away.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.cityofclovis.org/\">Clovis</a> is a stone's throw over New Mexico's border from Texas. It has just over 40,000 people, which makes it the great metropolis of this corner of the state. If you're heading west, you have to drive 200 miles to Albuquerque to come to the next city of that size in New Mexico. This is high-plains country, geographically more similar to the Texas panhandle just to its east than to the epic desert landscape to the west. Like the places I've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.useconomy\">written about</a>, it's a poor part of America, with an increasing number of struggling, hardscrabble farm in the outlying areas.</p> <p>New Mexico is one of several newly politically competitive states in the mountain and desert west. CNN reported that <a href=\"http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Poll--Obama-up-by-13-points-in-N-M-\">Obama is leading McCain in the state by 13%</a>. Like neighbouring Colorado, and McCain's home state of Arizona, it's a state that had Republican state leadership when Bush won the presidency in 2000 and that has seen its governors and other top positions go Democratic in the years since. Voters out here haven't voted Democratic because of any sudden enthusiasm for higher taxes and the other bug-bears rightly or wrongly associated with national Democrats. At least in part, the region has gone Democrat because, unlike the Oklahoma Panhandle communities I drove through earlier this week, its live-and-let-live population has come to loathe the authoritarian strain of thinking the Bush-Cheney team represents and deeply distrusts the direction government has taken since 2000.</p> <p>A few years back, one-time Colorado Senator and presidential hopeful Gary Hart <a href=\"http://www.westerndemocrat.com/files/GaryHart-DemocratsandtheWest.pdf\">penned a memo</a> to the Democratic Party's leaders arguing the West was ripe for picking and calling on his party to adopt a Western strategy. Choosing Denver to host the convention was a part of this strategy, as was inviting New Mexico governor Bill Richardson onto the stadium platform a couple hours before Obama's speech tonight. (He gave a powerful, emotionally charged speech, far better than that delivered by Al Gore immediately after.) If the Democrats win the west on the tails of popular governors like Richardson and Arizona's Janet Napolitano, they can afford to lose a couple of battleground states in the Midwest and still come out victorious. </p> <p>I figured I would drive into Clovis and find a bar or restaurant at which to watch the Obama speech and talk to people about their reactions. It wouldn't be hard \u2013 surely every television set in America would be tuned in to watch. </p> <p>But, as they say about the best laid plan. In a town with numerous restaurants and bars, not a single one was showing the speech. Some had no televisions; others did have TVs, but they were tuned to one or another sports channel and the owners and bar-tenders were damned if they were going to change channel for the convention. One waitress embarrassedly told me the owners had forbidden the staff to put on anything \"political\" on the television. I even phoned several restaurants to find out if they'd tune their TVs to the convention. To a person, the answer was an incredulous \"no.\"</p> <p>So, I watched the speech in my hotel room. In a way, the experience was instructive. If you've been watching cable news recently, you could be excused for thinking the entire world was about to stop to watch Obama, and you could be forgiven for concluding that nothing but politics was dripping from ordinary-Joes' lips from New York City to Los Angeles and everywhere in between. But, here in Clovis, if people were watching they were doing so in the privacy of their homes; and if they were out at the bars, as many were as the long Labor Day weekend got underway, they weren't imbibing politics. </p> <p>Potentially, that could be a problem for the Democrats, who had staked a huge amount of political capital on wowing America with an amphitheatre-like spectacle to conclude their four day show. It's not enough to get crowds watching in Times Square, or in house parties in LA. For Colorado to produce the needed polling bump, they have to reach the heartlands.</p> <p>On the other hand, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.democrats20082\">sheer majesty of Obama's speech</a>, the confidence he exuded, the promises he made, will, I believe, ricochet through the next two months. People in Clovis might not have watched the speech tonight, but you can be sure they'll be seeing extracts on the news and in political commercials from here until November. They'll see Obama going after McCain on economics and even on national security and military strategy, the Republican's terra firma. They'll see Obama pledging a new economic deal for working Americans. And they'll see footage of Michelle Obama and their two adorable children watching ecstatically as Barack spoke. That's all money in the bank for the Democrats.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2\">Obama's speech</a> was extraordinary, both in the ambition of its promises \u2013 a commitment to universal healthcare, to a renewed compact on quality education, a $150b investment in renewable energy technologies, a new foreign policy, a fairer tax system \u2013 and in the stunning delivery. It takes chutzpah and cajones, to address a crowd of 80,000 people. It could all too easily have gone horribly wrong \u2013 indeed, when he came onto the deep blue stage, initially Obama seemed slightly lost, saying \"thank you, thank you so much\" again and again and again in an ineffective effort to tamp down the crowd. But once he got into the meat of his speech, the candidate nailed it.</p> <p>There were echoes of Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Martin Luther King. This was speech-making at its very finest. </p> <p>Clovis might not have tuned in tonight, but its residents will be hearing about this speech for the next two months. And as the undecideds and the I-don't-cares start to line up with candidates, Obama's speech will filter into the heart of the country. This election will likely be a close-run thing, but eventually this remarkable feat of oratory might just tip the balance.</p>",
  "<p>One of the greatest gifts of our democracy is the opportunity it offers us every four years to change course. It's not a guarantee; it's only an opportunity. The question facing us is, simply put, will we seize this opportunity for change? That's why I came here tonight: to tell you why I feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.</p> <p>Eight years ago, some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didn't really matter who became president. Our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity. Some assumed we would continue both, no matter the outcome. But here we all are in 2008, and I doubt anyone would argue now that election didn't matter.</p> <p>Take it from me, if it had ended differently, we would not be bogged down in Iraq, we would have pursued bin Laden until we captured him. We would not be facing a self-inflicted economic crisis; we would be fighting for middle-income families. We would not be showing contempt for the Constitution; we'd be protecting the rights of every American regardless of race, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation. And we would not be denying the climate crisis; we'd be solving it.</p> <p>Today, we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000, though it may be even more obvious now, because John McCain, a man who has earned our respect on many levels, is now openly endorsing the policies of the Bush-Cheney White House and promising to actually continue them. The same policies all over again?</p> <p>Hey, I believe in recycling, but that's ridiculous. With John McCain's support, President Bush and Vice-President Cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact; their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term, subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short-circuit the rule of law.</p> <p>If you like the Bush-Cheney approach, John McCain's your man. If you want change, then vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.</p> <p>Barack Obama is telling us exactly what he will do: launch a bold new economic plan to restore America's greatness; fight for smarter government that trusts the market, but protects us against its excesses; enact policies that are pro-choice, pro-education and pro-family, establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong; provide healthcare for all and solutions for the climate crisis.</p> <p>So why is this election so close? Well, I know something about close elections, so let me offer you my opinion. I believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change Barack Obama represents.</p> <p>There is no better example than the climate crisis. As I have said for many years throughout this land, we're borrowing money from China to buy oil from the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilisation. Every bit of that has to change. Oil company profits have soared to record levels, gasoline prices have gone through the roof and we are more dependent than ever on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels.</p> <p>Many scientists predict that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months in the first term of the next president. Sea levels are rising, fires are raging, storms are stronger. Military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world, and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions.</p> <p>We are facing a planetary emergency which, if not solved, would exceed anything we've ever experienced in the history of humankind. In spite of John McCain's past record of open-mindedness on the climate crisis, he has apparently now allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution.</p> <p>And it just so happens that the climate crisis is intertwined with the other two great challenges facing our nation: reviving our economy and strengthening our national security. The solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon-based fuels.</p> <p>Instead of letting lobbyists and polluters control our destiny, we need to invest in American innovation. Almost 100 years ago, Thomas Edison said, \"I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.\" We already have everything we need to use the sun, the wind, geothermal power, conservation and efficiency to solve the climate crisis - everything, that is, except a president who inspires us to believe: \"Yes we can.\"</p> <p>So how did this no-brainer become a brain-twister? Because the carbon fuels industry - big oil and coal - have a 50-year lease on the Republican party and they are drilling it for everything it's worth. And this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem, when they are in fact making it worse every single day.</p> <p>This administration and the special interests who control it lock, stock and barrel after barrel, have performed this same sleight-of-hand on issue after issue. Some of the best marketers have the worst products; and this is certainly true of today's Republican party. The party itself has on its rolls men and women of great quality. But the last eight years demonstrate that the special interests who have come to control the Republican party are so powerful that serving them and serving the national wellbeing are now irreconcilable choices.</p> <p>So what can we do about it? We can carry Barack Obama's message of hope and change to every family in America. And pledge that we will be there for Barack Obama - not only in the heat of this election, but in the aftermath as we put his agenda to work for our country.</p> <p>We can tell Republicans and Independents, as well as Democrats, why our nation needs a change from the approach of Bush, Cheney and McCain. After they wrecked our economy, it is time for a change. After they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us, it's time for a change. After they abandoned the American principle first laid down by general George Washington, when he prohibited the torture of captives because it would bring, in his words, \"shame, disgrace and ruin\" to our nation, it's time for a change.</p> <p>When as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president, and John McCain promises to appoint more Scalias and Thomases and end a woman's right to choose, it's time for a change.</p> <p>Many people have been waiting for some sign that our country is ready for such change. How will we know when it's beginning to take hold? I think we might recognise it as a sign of such change, if we saw millions of young people getting involved for the first time in the political process. This election is actually not close at all among younger voters - you are responding in unprecedented numbers to Barack Obama's message of change and hope.</p> <p>You recognise that he represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division. You understand that the politics of the past are exhausted, and you're tired of appeals based on fear. You know that America is capable of better than what you have seen in recent years. You are hungry for a new politics based on bipartisan respect for the ageless principles embodied in the United States Constitution.</p> <p>There are times in the history of our nation when our very way of life depends upon awakening to the challenge of a present danger, shaking off complacency to rise, clear-eyed and alert, to the necessity of embracing change.</p> <p>A century and a half ago, when America faced our greatest trial, the end of one era gave way to the birth of another. The candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president. Before he entered the White House, Abraham Lincoln's experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in Springfield, Illinois, and one term in Congress - during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history.</p> <p>The experience Lincoln's supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse. He was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator, with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land. He insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity. In 2008, once again, we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning. And once again, we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition.</p> <p>Barack Obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises. His leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope, in the promise of the American dream of a boundless future. His experience has also given him genuine respect for different views and humility, in the face of complex realities that cannot be squeezed into the narrow compartments of ideology. His experience has taught him something that career politicians often overlook: that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance.</p> <p>The extraordinary strength of his personal character - and that of his wonderful wife, Michelle - is grounded in the strengths of the American community. His vision and his voice represent the best of America. His life experience embodies the essence of our motto - e pluribus unum - out of many, one. That is the linking identity at the other end of all the hyphens that pervade our modern political culture. It is that common American identity \u2013 which Barack Obama exemplifies, heart and soul - that enables us as Americans to speak with moral authority to all of the peoples of the world, to inspire hope that we as human beings can transcend our limitations and to redeem the promise of human freedom.</p> <p>Late this evening, our convention will end with a benediction. As we bow in reverence, remember the words of the old proverb: \"when you pray, move your feet.\" Then let us leave here tonight and take the message of hope from Denver to every corner of our land, and do everything we can to serve our nation, our world - and most importantly, our children and their future - by electing Barack Obama President of the United States.</p>",

To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p> <p>To the love of my life, our next first lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p> <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p> <p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generationcan pursue their dreams as well.</p> <p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for 232 years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive.</p> <p>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p> <p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p> <p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush.</p> <p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p> <p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p> <p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p> <p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p> <p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90% of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90% of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on healthcare and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this president. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners\".</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle class as someone making under $5m a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a healthcare plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No healthcare? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23m new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p> <p>What is that promise?</p> <p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p> <p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p> <p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p> <p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p> <p>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p> <p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am president.</p> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p> <p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and John McCain has been there for 26 of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150bn dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and 5m new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. If you have healthcare, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.</p> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet 21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy.</p> <p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength\". Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programmes alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <p>And just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79bn surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future.</p> <p>These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p> <p>But what I will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <p>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p> <p>You make a big election about small things.</p> <p>And you know what - it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.</p> <p>I get it. I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <p>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided healthcare to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</p> <p>And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</p> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p> <p>That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p> <p>And it is that promise that 45 years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in Washington, before Lincoln's memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p> <p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p> <p>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p> <p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p> <p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p> <p>Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.</p>",

I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p> <p>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p> <p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p> <p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p> <p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.</p> <p>We meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p> <p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p> <p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.</p> <p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p> <p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p> <p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p> <p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p> <p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land enough! This moment this election is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p> <p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p> <p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.</p> <p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this President. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisors the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners.\"</p> <p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p> <p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</p> <p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No health care? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p> <p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p> <p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p> <p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p> <p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p> <p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p> <p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p> <p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p> <p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p> <p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p> <p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.</p> <p>What is that promise?</p> <p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p> <p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p> <p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p> <p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p> <p>That's the promise of America the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p> <p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p> <p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p> <p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p> <p>I will cut taxes cut taxes for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p> <p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p> <p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p> <p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p> <p>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p> <p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p> <p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p> <p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p> <p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.</p> <p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p> <p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.</p> <p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength.\" Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p> <p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility that's the essence of America's promise.</p> <p>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p> <p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p> <p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p> <p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p> <p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice but it is not the change we need.</p> <p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p> <p>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p> <p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.</p> <p>These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p> <p>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p> <p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America they have served the United States of America.</p> <p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p> <p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p> <p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p> <p>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p> <p>You make a big election about small things.</p> <p>And you know what it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.</p> <p>I get it. I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p> <p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p> <p>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p> <p>America, this is one of those moments.</p> <p>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work. I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</p> <p>And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</p> <p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p> <p>Instead, it is that American spirit that American promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p> <p>That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p> <p>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p> <p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p> <p>But what the people heard instead people of every creed and color, from every walk of life is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p> <p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p> <p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise that American promise and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p> <p>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.</p> <p>[<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">Go back</a> to the liveblog]</p>"
