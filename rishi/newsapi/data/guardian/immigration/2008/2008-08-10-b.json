  "<p>Britain could create the \"glue\" to reunite a divided society and set out its future aspirations by embracing a bill of rights which goes much further than existing rights to embrace positive social and economic freedoms, a group of MPs and peers told ministers yesterday.</p> <p>\"A UK bill of rights and freedoms would be a constitutional landmark. It would provide a framework both for protecting the liberty of the individual against the intrusion of state power, and for protecting the 'little person' against powerful interests,\" the committee's chairman, Andrew Dismore MP, explained yesterday.</p> <p>Such a move could open up the gradual prospect of individuals - especially the \"vulnerable and marginalised\" - being able to go to court to enforce the right to decent housing, healthcare or education for a child with special needs. </p> <p>It might also prevent failed asylum seekers being denied benefits as is currently official policy, the joint Lords-Commons committee on human rights (JCHR) says in a new report. Such changes might help offset \"the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorism\".</p> <p>The committee, chaired by Labour's Dismore, is aware of the political sensitivities involved. Any proposal that might give greater power to courts to allocate public resources - money or services - would be seen as infringing the prerogative of elected ministers and MPs. So the JCHR's remedy would allow court rulings to be merely influenced by a new \"underpinning\" of human rights - rather than create \"directly enforceable duties,\" the report explains.</p> <p>The committee, which monitors a range of human rights issues, opposes suggestions that right should be conditional on good behaviour, though it does propose inclusion of \"civic duty\" to fellow citizens.</p> <p>It also rejects ministerial suggestions that the bill of rights ideas now being discussed within Gordon Brown's government - a process being led by Jack Straw, the justice minister - should be called a British bill of rights. So as to include Northern Ireland it should be a UK bill of rights and freedoms.</p> <p>But the scope envisaged by the JCHR would embrace new areas of international human rights and contain the specific guarantee of the right to asylum. It would also include the right to \"a healthy and sustainable environment\" - the kind of aspiration that might tilt a court ruling more positively in that direction.</p> <p>Historically, rights have been largely focused on the legal and political kind that include freedom of speech, access to justice and the ballot box - as well as \"negative freedoms\" such as those from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment or religious persecution. The Dismore committee wants the government - or an incoming Tory government, which has also promised a bill of rights - to build on \"positive freedoms\" of the kind first expounded by the US president Franklin Roosevelt as part of his Four Freedoms in 1941.</p>",
  "<p>The flare-up of major hostilities between Russia and Georgia has been dubbed by some \"the pipeline war\". The landlocked Caspian sea's huge oil reserves are a factor, especially since Georgia became a key transit country for oil to travel from Baku in Azerbaijan to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.</p> <p>The pipeline, which was completed in May 2006, is the second longest in the world. Although its route was chosen in order to bypass Russia, denying Moscow leverage over a key resource and a potential source of pressure, the current crisis in the Caucasus is about issues far bigger than oil.</p> <p>The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline is only a minor element in a much larger strategic equation: an attempt, sponsored largely by the United States but eagerly subscribed to by several of its new ex-Soviet allies, to reduce every aspect of Russian influence throughout the region, whether it be economic, political, diplomatic or military. </p> <p>Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili is the region's most enthusiastic proponent of this strategy. His \"pipeline neighbours\", Azerbaijan and Turkey, are less virulent. They have been trying to reap the economic benefits of Caspian oil while keeping good relations with Russia and avoiding provocations. </p> <p>The question now is whether Saakashvili has over-reached himself. Has his escalation of the South Ossetian crisis done more than destroy any chance of normalising Georgian relations with Russia as long as he remains president? Has it reinforced his image among many western leaders as a hothead, and set back his hopes of getting a promise from Nato this autumn to start membership proceedings? France and Germany led Nato's cautious camp in April when they forced President Bush to delay a membership action plan for Georgia for months. Their argument that Georgia is not yet ready may well be strengthened now.</p> <p>The sudden crisis has put the United States on the spot. While supporting Georgia's Nato ambitions, the White House was leery of military action, knowing it could do little in the face of a powerful Russian response. Visiting the former Soviet republic in 2005, President Bush urged Saakashvili to keep cool. \"Georgia's leaders know that the peaceful resolution of conflict is essential to your integration into the transatlantic community,\" he told a huge rally in Tbilisi. </p> <p>Saakashvili's supporters claim Nato's delay was what emboldened Russia to stir up tension in Abkhazia (the other rebel area of Georgia) and South Ossetia this spring and summer. \"It was interpreted by the Russians as a window of opportunity,\" George Kandelaki, deputy chair of the Georgian parliament's foreign relations committee, said yesterday. Like other Georgians, he argued that it was not his country's forces that took the initiative last week for escalation in what had been in recent months a low level, tit-for-tat series of border incidents.</p> <p>The fighting backfired, and the Russian counteroffensive now seems aimed at capturing the 40% of South Ossetia which was under Georgian control until last week. \"They [the Russians] control pretty much all of South Ossetia now,\" Kandelaki said, adding: \"They're trying to take over all of Abkhazia.\"</p> <p>If the Russians succeed, they will have to decide whether to keep the newly acquired territory as a bargaining chip for negotiations with Saakashvili, or go to the extreme of encouraging South Ossetia, now unified, to do what most of its inhabitants want - proclaim independence from Georgia and a referendum on joining North Ossetia, its ethnic twin on the northern side of the Caucasus mountains. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, hinted at the tougher option, when he told Ossetian refugees this weekend that Georgia had lost the right to rule the territory.</p> <p>When the fighting ends and the dust settles, Saakashvili may also face an onslaught from his political opposition in Georgia. In the heat of battle, parliamentary leaders have rallied round the national flag, but if a ceasefire comes with all Georgian troops and civilians driven out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Saaksahvili may be called to account for losing not just territory but the chance of early membership of Nato as well.</p>",

  "<p>Annika Sorenstam's dreams of one last triumph in her home tournament were dashed by the Korean teenager Amy Yang, who claimed her maiden professional victory after equalling the course record with a nine-under-par 63 yesterday that gave her a six-shot victory at the Scandinavian TPC in Stockholm.</p> <p>The 37-year-old Sorenstam, who is retiring in December, eagled the par-four 17th to move into second place. But she suffered a double bogey on the last, hitting her tee shot into the water and three-putting. The tournament host's poor finish before a packed gallery dropped her into a tie for sixth with three other Swedes. Sorenstam won this event six times between 1997 and 2006, during which time it was named the Compaq Open, HP Open and Scandinavian TPC Hosted by Annika.</p> <p>Yang finished with a 54-hole total of 202, 14 under par, on the Frosaker course after trailing the overnight leader, Lill </p> <p>Saether of Norway, by four shots going into the final round in the rain-shortened European Ladies Tour event. The 19-year-old Korean birdied seven of 10 holes from the 3rd to take a lead she never relinquished, wrapping up her victory with birdies on the final three holes. Her only bogey came on the 2nd.</p> <p>This was Yang's first victory as a professional. She took the ANZ Ladies Masters as a 16-year-old school student in 2006, becoming the first amateur to win a major women's professional tournament in Australia. Here she tied the course record set earlier in the day by Minea Blomqvist of Finland, who shared second with Melodie Bourdy of France (66), Saether (73) and Maria Hjorth of Sweden (72). Jill McGill, the only American LPGA Tour player in the field, tied for 13th.</p> <p>Last year's winner Catriona Matthew of Scotland did not defend her title here while the Swede Helen Alfredsson, the European Tour's money leader who finished runner-up in the US Open and recently won the Evian Masters, also skipped the tournament - playing instead in an event in Sweden hosted by the ice hockey star Peter Forsberg.</p> <p>Sorenstam closed with a 72 for a 209 total, seven shots behind Yang. Also on that figure were Liselotte Neumann, a former US and British Open champion, the amateur Anna Nordqvist and Louise Friberg.</p> <p>The winner of 10 majors and 72 LPGA titles and the all-time leader on the LPGA's career money list, Sorenstam is quitting the game after this season to get married, start a family and focus on her business and other golf interests, including course design and overseeing the Annika Academy, which she opened in 2007.</p> <p>Sorenstam has dominated the women's game for much of the past 15 years, having made her professional debut on the European Tour in 1993, when she was named rookie of the year. She is the only woman to have shot a 59 in competition and was the first since Babe Zaharias to have been invited to play a men's PGA event when she competed in the Colonial at Fort Worth, Texas in May 2003. </p> <p>Following a dip in form resulting from what she called a lack of focus after reaching all her early goals, Sorenstam relinquished the top spot in 1999 only to rededicate herself to training and take it back in 2001, since when she has won eight of her 10 majors. The world No1 ranking was taken over by Lorena Ochoa of Mexico in April 2007. </p> <p>Sorenstam announced her retirement in May of this year and will play her final competitive tournament in Europe in another Tour event, in Denmark, on September 5-7 before making her last start, at the Dubai Ladies Masters, on December 11-14. She will marry her fianc\u00e9 Mike McGee in 2009.</p>",
  "<p>The best-selling action hero of the 21st century - Lee Child's ex-military cop Jack Reacher - has no home and no baggage. He roams the US via a succession of cheap motels, wearing the Primarky clothes he bought last week and will throw away next week. He couldn't care less about house prices. Houses just slow him down.</p> <p>Much the same, perhaps, might be said for the chief spokesman of Poles in Britain who, having caught the Daily Mail on the back foot, used its columns last week to note that as Poland's currency almost doubles against the pound there is suddenly \"more concern over departures than arrivals\".</p> <p>Mobility of labour is top of many wish lists. The single market in manpower that Brussels helped invent has become reality and feeds on itself. Bulgaria's labour minister recently announced visa quotas for Moldovan and Vietnamese workers brought in to do the sundry dirty jobs at home that 1.7 million Bulgarians have gone to Italy, Spain and the rest to do these past few years. Mobility is a global tide that never turns. So what on earth is this howl of house price angst about?</p> <p>The whole point about mobility is that it puts bricks and mortar on the periphery. Westward ho! the wagons. America's early prosperity was founded on road trips, trail drives and constant questing. Who wanted a little grey homestead to weigh them down?</p> <p>Yet that, in essence, is what the sub-prime crisis is all about. Mexicans, Guatemalans and Colombians move with the market; modern Americans put down roots and stick. And that, in turn, is where traditional British ambition becomes total confusion. </p> <p>Houses in Britain are too expensive - too few in a too crowded land, which guarantees riches from ownership once you get on the hallowed property ladder. So apparently governments must build hundreds of thousands extra a year to bring the price down - except, when it falls by an average 20 grand or more, that's disaster, and (in an early dose of dithering) stamp duties must somehow be waived to get the ladder rising again, thus ensuring a better (or fatter) life for those who can clamber aboard. </p> <p>It somehow becomes the state's job to make sure the carousel of expectation keeps turning. But as prices tumble and repossessions soar by 48%, the smug, snug days are over - and the home itself is a curse, not a blessing. Everyone, it seemed, could buy their own mini-castle - and sit back and see its value increase as though by magic. Everyone had the problem of inheritance tax pending as the rich list awaited.</p> <p>It was self-deluding. Fifteen years ago, as Spanish unemployment hovered near 20%, we guessed where the cracking point would come. It didn't, because those who had come to the city from the countryside simply went back again until things improved. </p> <p>Already, you can see parallel convulsions happening across Europe. President Sarkozy, who didn't want Polish plumbers, is letting them in. Bulgarians can go home to Sofia and send the Vietnamese back where they came from. It's a pragmatic, hardnosed, unlovable process.</p> <p>But we haven't shed our illusions. The headlines see ownership - and rising value - as a right. We assume that when Poles arrive here they'll stay, because that's what we would do in their place. And nobody wants precisely what a government that has sniffed the wind should be encouraging: thousands more cheap apartments for short-term lets, not sale, the underpinning of 21st-century flexibility. Relocation, relocation: this isn't a world of nests, illusions and desperate housewives any longer. It's a world where Jack Reacher and Kirstie Allsop head for the nearest motel.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>When Middlesbrough bought Dean Windass from Bradford City in 2001 the manager, Bryan Robson, made much of his new signing's bullish power and rugged frame. Unfortunately this was followed shortly afterwards by the news that the striker would miss several games after jarping his back lifting a bag out of the boot of his car.</p> <p>Seven years later and the Hull City forward is back in the Premier League, now at an age when experience will have taught him to approach such domestic tasks with a deal more circumspection. Windass is entering a period of life when most men have started to eye up comfort-fit slacks and abandoning any thought of ever again being able to look down and see their feet. If he makes it to April the forward will become only the fifth outfield player in the history of the English game to play in the top flight past his 40th birthday. </p> <p>The burly Humbersider may look as solid as a butcher's block and possess the face of Brian Glover's harder brother but even he is unlikely to break the record set by Sir Stanley Matthews. The great winger played his last game for Stoke City in 1965 at the tender age of 50 years and five days, calling to mind the great US basketball coach Wimp Sanderson's crack, \"I'm so old, when I started out the Dead Sea wasn't even sick.\"</p> <p>Nor does it seem likely that Windass will surpass Manchester City's Billy Meredith, who turned out at Maine Road in 1924 when well on his way to his 50th birthday. However, should he avoid doing himself further bag-related mischief, the Hull veteran may yet overtake two oldsters of more recent vintage, Gordon Strachan (40 years and 83 days for Coventry City in 1997) and Teddy Sheringham (40 years and 270 days for West Ham United in 2006).</p> <p>Thanks to better medical treatment, training methods and rule changes that now confine \"reducer\" tackles to after-dinner speaker circuit anecdotes of life with Terry Hurlock, the chances of players going on till well past the point when they are having to tell their team-mates that actually it's the Ting Tings who sound like Blondie not vice versa are greatly increased. In football the average age of spectators has risen and so has the average age of the players, with few Premier League dressing rooms these days lacking the influence of blokes who can remember when football was still a contact sport and aren't afraid to mention it at least once a day. Nevertheless it takes a special type of man to cross into his fifth decade while still wearing shorts to do his day job.</p> <p>A tough upbringing seems to be one factor. The majority of these long serving footballers experienced hardship during their lives. Windass did shifts in the Birds Eye frozen pea factory. Meredith worked down a coal mine. Matthews grew up during the Depression. Strachan once went to the pub with Paul McGrath, Bryan Robson and Norman Whiteside (the fearsome trio took him home afterwards in the boot of the car), while Sheringham had to put up with being called \"Edward\" by Brian Clough. </p> <p>Diet is also a factor. Matthews was said never to eat an ounce of fat while Strachan existed on an eccentric diet of porridge, bananas and seaweed. Asked if the seaweed made him fitter he replied: \"It made me swim faster.\" John Burridge, one of half-a-dozen goalkeepers who have played in the top flight in their forties, was another veteran who took a fastidious approach to food, rejecting the traditional 1970s player staples of steak and chips in favour of boiled rice, steamed fish and vegetables. </p> <p>Fruit also played a big part in the life of the much-travelled Budgie, apples and oranges were less a foodstuff than a training aid. As a former Aston Villa team-mate Andy Gray recalls of their time sharing a house together: \"On Friday nights Budge would come down into the sitting room wearing his goalkeeping gloves and sit down on the sofa in front of the TV. My job was to test his reflexes by hurling bits of fruit at him when he least expected it.\"</p> <p>Windass has his own exercise and fitness regime designed for him by his wife Helen, a Humberside policewoman. Matthews ran up and down sand dunes. Peter Shilton - another post-40 'keeper - focused on bodybuilding using a lethal, spring-loaded device called a bullworker, which could be bought at most sports shops in the 1970s and was probably responsible for loosening the teeth of more adolescent boys of the babyboomer generation than Cresta soda and Curlywurly bars. When not catching satsumas and palming away pears, Burridge used to hang from the banister by his feet.</p> <p>As this suggests eccentricity may also aid longevity. Meredith - nicknamed \"Old Skinny\" - played with a toothpick in his mouth. The toothpick was actually not his first choice. When he started playing for City he used to chew tobacco during matches but the kit man complained about the brown marks his nicotine-stained spittle made on the shirts and he was ordered to cut it out. </p> <p>The Welsh Wizard was a firebrand who founded one of the first players' trade unions. Windass has displayed no interest in labour organisation but he does like the music of Paul Weller and has displayed a distinct unwillingness to kowtow to the authorities, picking up three red cards in a single game when playing for Aberdeen and two years ago earning a five-match ban for shouting abuse at referee Darren Drysdale in the Valley Parade car park.</p> <p>As the old Chinese proverb has it, \"Before thirty, a man seeks injury; after thirty, injury seeks him.\" However fit they are and no matter what they eat and drink the older player is going to have to face life with a body that creaks and wheezes like a broken harmonium. Aches and strains are commonplace for the ageing footballer. Recounting his final years of ice packs and heat treatments Strachan would note: \"My bum has been through every temperature known to man.\" </p> <p>He may lack pace and it may sound as if he's making popcorn whenever he gets out of a chair but a veteran brings experience and wisdom to his team. \"It's not nice to get old but it's nice to ripen,\" Brigitte Bardot once remarked. As he puts his favourite track \"A Town Called Malice\" on the dressing-room stereo and has to explain to his team-mates once again who Mrs Thatcher was, Dean Windass will surely know what the French sex kitten meant.</p>",
  "<p>Millionaires and Hollywood stars visiting Italy have been put on notice that they no longer own the beach after a group of celebrities led by Flavio Briatore, co-owner of QPR football club, were pelted with wet sand and showered with water as they tried to land dinghies on a crowded Sardinian beach.</p> <p>Already victims of shrinking spending power and sky-rocketing rates for renting deckchairs, Italians have descended on their beaches this August in a surly mood, and the sight of the Briatore-led flotilla as it carved a swath through alarmed swimmers was enough to spark a near riot on Friday at the packed Capriccioli beach. </p> <p>The Italian newspaper La Stampa seized on the episode as the start of a fightback against celebrities flaunting their wealth on the country's top beaches, stating: \"From north to south, the rebellion against those who show off their money and power is growing.\"</p> <p>The authorities also appear to be clamping down. Last week, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones came ashore from their yacht at the Italian resort of Santa Margherita Ligure, the same spot where locals were kept awake in June by thumping music from Wayne Rooney's rented yacht.

Louts! Go home!\", a mob formed to greet the third dinghy, attempting to push it back out to sea, as mothers filled their children's buckets with water to sling at the passengers and wet sand bombs were hurled. </p> <p>The episode marked a tough homecoming for Briatore, who has enjoyed an extended honeymoon since his star-studded Rome wedding in June. \"We are nice people and we get rewarded like this,\" Corriere della Sera quoted Briatore as saying after he returned to the beach to find out why his guests were being drenched. \"I will close down everything,\" he warned. \"I pay taxes, this is my right.\"</p> <p>With his new restaurant designed as a lunch stop for passing mega-yachts, Briatore may be wondering how Arab princes and Russian oligarchs will react to lobbed sand. But a Billionaire spokesman hinted that all may be in hand: \"This year we are opening the restaurant, but from next year we will manage the beach as well.\"</p>",

  "<p>I always find it quite reassuring when flying over this country, either by aeroplane or via Google Earth, to see how much green there is left. Watching Andrew Marr's <strong>Britain from Above</strong> (BBC1, Sunday), I'm getting a very different picture. Clogged roads and railways, the smoking nation's ageing arteries, run between massive landfill sites and even more massive sewage works. Ships crawl, bumper to bumper, round our shores. Biblical swarms of aeroplanes darken our skies. The ether hums and crackles with information overload. Total meltdown is never far away.</p> <p>And because so much of this is represented graphically on this show - we follow dots of light as they trace the paths of traffic, flights, telephone calls etc - it looks as if Britain is populated by millions of glow worms. A nation of writhing, tangled phosphorescent worms, parasites sucking the life out of the place - that's a far cry from Alan Titchmarsh's cosy The Nature of Britain. </p> <p>But that's a good thing. After all the picture postcard views - Titchmarsh, David Dimbleby's buildings, Bill Oddie's birds, the rutting stags, Coast (again and again, round and round we go; puffins, more puffins), it's nice to be brought down to earth (by going up into the sky, interestingly). There is loads of fascinating stuff here; I was particularly interested in how the delicate balance of our national electricity supply is affected by what's going on in EastEnders. And Andy M is engaging and animated enough to make it not feel like double geography (just). </p> <p>What I'm not sure about is the overall premise - the \"from above\" bit. It's almost as if someone thought: \"Hmm, those Britain-is-brilliant programmes have done very well recently, is there anything left, any new angles? Yes, Britain from Above! Eureka!\" </p> <p>But I'm not sure a new physical angle works as a new thematic angle. Is Britain from Above really so very different from Britain from the Side? And will Britain from Below follow? Up Britain's Skirt? Perverts' Britain?</p> <p>I suppose no one would have watched a programme called Britain's Stretched Infrastructure, which is what this first episode of three is really about. So they had to come up with some kind of wheeze, with a lot of overhead shots. What does it all add up to though - the sewage, and the landfill, the rules to prevent collisions at sea, the glow worms, even Andy Marr's hangover cures? I'm not quite sure. </p> <p>The <strong>John Akii-Bua Story: An African Tragedy</strong> (BBC2, Sunday), about the Ugandan 400m hurdler who won gold in Munich in 1972, was a bit special. What a story. </p> <p>Imagine Paula Radcliffe gets the gold in Beijing, in world-record-breaking time, and returns to national adulation. But then things get a bit hairy under the murderous regime of His Excellency, Prime Minister for Life, Field Marshal Gordon Brown Dada. Many of Paula's friends and relatives are tortured and murdered; her Olympic medal is the only thing that keeps her alive. Fearing that her time is running out, she dodges the death squads to escape over the border to France, where she ends up in a refugee camp. A foreign news crew find her there, once a glorious Olympic champion, now living without dignity amid squalor and starvation . . .</p> <p>Except this crude (crass, you might say) comparison still doesn't do John Akii-Bua justice. Because Paula has a track record, in every sense of the phrase. And support, funding, money, shoes - lots of things John Akii-Bua never had. He came from nowhere. Well, he came from Uganda, where he trained in bare feet on a grass track, coached by his British trainer, cigarette-puffing Malcolm Arnold. But no one imagined he'd beat our own David Hemery to the line in Munich, and in a record time that it took the great Ed Moses to beat. Oh, and my favourite revelation of all: on the night before his Olympic victory, John drank a whole bottle of champagne, provided by his coach. To help him sleep. I wonder if Paula's got a bottle of Bolly with her, ready for the night before.</p> <p>After a victory lap with the Ugandan flag, Akii-Bua returned to the hell of Idi Amin's regime, and his athletic career came second to trying to stay alive. </p> <p>This was a lovely, moving, funny, tragic film. All the right people contributed: John's friends, and relatives, the great Ed Moses. And Malcolm Arnold, now a senior coach with the British team (no word on whether he's still on the ciggies, or if he's taken a few crates of bubbly out to Beijing with him). The only person missing was John Akii-Bua himself. He died in 1997, aged 48. </p> <p><strong>What did you think?

  "<p>In last Tuesday's Daily Mail, the lead letter, from the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, was headlined \"Poles feel persecuted\". The writer, Wiktor Moszczynski, complained about \"newspaper coverage emphasising negative aspects of the Polish presence in the UK\". Poles were linked to problems in the NHS and schools, unemployment among Britons, drug smuggling, rape and so on. They felt humiliated and vulnerable; \"hundreds of hate crimes against Poles, some leading to injury or death\" had been recorded.</p> <p>The letter did not name any offending newspaper and Mail readers could be forgiven for wondering why it was there, on a letters page that, as in most downmarket papers, is tucked away between TV listings and sport. In fact, it follows a long dispute between Moszczynski and the Mail and his letter (a longer version ran on the Mail's website) is part of a resolution brokered by the Press Complaints Commission. Though other newspapers run stories portraying Poles and other Eastern European migrants in a bad light - for example, Moszczynski has reported a Times column to the PCC - the Mail is by far the most consistent offender. Moszczynski's complaint listed 80 headlines since May 2006, but a trawl through the Mail online archive suggests he could have included many more.</p> <p>Most of the stories were newsworthy and largely accurate. The objection is to the way they are presented and the drip, drip effect of continually highlighting the Polish connection. As Moszczynski puts it, they \"ensure that the average Daily Mail reader's heart skips a beat each time with either indignation or alarm\". The recent influx of East Europeans has allowed the Mail and other papers to revive their traditions of stoking xenophobia. Bigotry against black or brown people is no longer acceptable and may even fall foul of the law. The trick is to find substitutes. The Daily Express prefers \"illegals\", the Mail concentrates on \"Poles\".</p> <p>The Mail's pieces, whatever the news that prompts them, portray an arcadian England sullied by rude foreign intruders, sponging off native taxpayers. \"Here in Peterborough,\" writes Sue Reid, \"a beautiful, quintessentially English city ... word of the government's largesse has spread quickly among ... the fastest-growing multi-ethnic community in provincial Britain.\" The headline is \"The town the Poles took over\". Fiona Barton enters the Polskie Delikatesy and, among the red cabbage and pickled cucumbers, can't make herself understood. \"I feel like a foreigner, but this is not Warsaw, Krakow or Gdansk. I am in Southampton.\"</p> <p>Some stories are clearly intended to create indignation: \"Polish migrants living in Britain claiming \u00a321m in benefits for children left behind\" and \"Fears for NHS and schools as 1,000 Polish children are born EVERY month\" are examples. Other stories are a touch more subtle. Any attempt by banks, supermarkets, pubs and publishers to cater for a growing Polish market is assiduously reported by the Mail, alongside stories about how police, firefighters and local authorities train a few staff to speak Polish or produce leaflets in the language. They are frequently preceded by the preposition \"now\", conveying the subtext \"whatever next?\" </p> <p>When Poles are involved in road accidents, that is usually, according to the Mail, because they can't understand English road signs. But when councils produce signs in Polish, that is a waste of taxpayers' money. One story contrasted Polish road signs here with a threat from the Polish government to \"deport Britons who fall ill\". In fact, only foreigners with such serious diseases as cholera and yellow fever would be refused treatment in Poland - because the country doesn't have the resources to cope.</p> <p>In the Mail, Poles are blamed for the most unlikely things. \"Beer prices set to rise as Polish lager sales soar 250%\", screamed one headline as though the two were connected. Poles can do nothing right. Like many migrants, they make substantial remittances to their families at home - which might be thought admirable because it ensures the money reaches people who need it. In the Mail, however, the headline is \"Polish immigrants take \u00a31m out of the UK economy\". If Poles return home, the Mail presents it as desertion of the UK. Though it is not usually vigilant in defence of gays, the Mail reported the Polish deputy education minister's plans to fire teachers who promoted \"homosexual culture\".</p> <p>Sometimes the paper's hatred of Poles fights with its belief that Britain is, in any case, going to the dogs, as when a teenage Pole returned home because, he said, schools in Poland are far superior. The Mail's implied verdict was that Poles had added insult to injury.</p> <p>Moszczynski thinks the Mail has mended its ways since his approach to the PCC and says \"there's not been much to complain about lately\". To my mind, he is too generous. Polish immigration is not as hot a story as it was, but the Mail still loses no opportunity to tickle readers' prejudices. Last month, for example, it reported that two bus company bosses were jailed after faking documents to cover up safety breaches. Some drivers worked for up to 31 consecutive days without a break and 16 unsafe buses were found at the company depot. All credit to the Mail for reporting this example of employers endangering their workers and customers. The aspect it highlighted, however, was the company's employment of Poles. They were in the first sentence of the story and in the headline on the Mail's website (albeit not in the paper). A prominent tinted box detailed bus companies' \"recruitment drive for Polish staff\", when the industry's frequent flouting of health and safety regulations was surely more relevant.</p> <p>The Mail is remarkably adept at detecting the talking points of middle England. That is the secret of its success. I don't deny - and neither does Moszczynski - that the Poles' arrival in large numbers genuinely caused resentment, some of it possibly justified, against government policies. But that does not excuse the Mail turning Poles into villains and dragging them gratuitously into every possible story. Like most journalists, I admire the paper's professional brilliance which, occasionally, is used to make points I agree with. That should not blind us to the truth: the Mail habitually uses what Tony Blair once called its \"absolute and unaccountable power\" to legitimise hatred and prejudice and debase public debate.</p> <p><strong>Guilty as headlined</strong></p> <p>So Barry George is innocent? Not if you read some papers. \"\u00a31m payout for Dando 'killer'\", was the Daily Express headline. As any headline writer knows, readers don't take in the quote marks. \"Barry George raped a girl on her doorstep\", recorded the Sun's headlines. \"He broke into Princess Di's home in a mask. He boasted he knew Jill Dando. So who did kill Jill?\" Obvious, innit? Inside, the paper headlined \"his 10 'links' to Dando\" (those quote marks again) that the jury didn't know about. A leader added that the Old Bailey verdict, acquitting George, \"means her killer is on our streets\". Which is probably true, though it's always possible the murderer has emigrated. But we know what the Sun really wants us to think.</p> <p>That is justice as dispensed by the red-top press. Evidence is for soppy liberals. It is enough to say he's just the sort wot would have dun it.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Torn hamstring</strong></p> <p>Occurs during high-speed running and kicking and has one of the highest recurrence rates of all football-related injuries. Hamstring injuries can be related to back problems and are therefore more complicated to treat. Michael Owen suffered his first serious hamstring injury for Liverpool against Leeds on April 14, 1999, pulling up when chasing a through-ball. He did not play again until the next season, on August 28, against Arsenal. Rehab involves strength and flexibility exercises and massage for hamstrings along with manual treatment of the lower back.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>2-3 weeks up to several months.</p> <p><strong>Sprained ankle</strong></p> <p>The most common ligament to damage is on the outside of the ankle. Going over on the ankle stretches the ligaments and, at its most severe, can cause complete tearing and sometimes even break off the tip of the ankle bone. Arjen Robben sprained his ankle after a horrendous tackle by Quique Alvarez in Real Madrid's game against Recreativo on March 1, 2008 and returned on March 23. Rehab focuses on balance (ligaments are very important in stability), strength and flexibility.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>2-8 weeks.</p> <p><strong>Torn knee cartilage</strong></p> <p>The cartilage is the cushioning in the joint. It can be damaged by twisting and cause a tear or a fold, which often needs to be removed surgically. Robbie Keane, famously, ruptured his knee cartilage while stretching for the remote control in 1998 and, this time on the pitch, in December 2006. The second time he took one month and two days to regain his match fitness. Rehab involves surgery then rest before strengthening of thigh muscles as well as balance and flexibility.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>3-8 weeks.</p> <p><strong>Broken leg</strong></p> <p>Can be caused by an opponent's tackle but also, frighteningly, happens when a player is unchallenged, as David Busst, Henrik Larsson and Djibril Ciss\u00e9 (twice) have found out. Roberto Di Matteo suffered a triple fracture in September 2000 after an innocuous tackle and spent 18 months trying to get back to full fitness but never played again. If it is not a clean break, the injury may require surgery, then casting and subsequent physiotherapy.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>from 12 weeks. If the fracture is complex it can take up to a year. Some players, however, may never play again.</p> <p><strong>Anterior cruciate knee ligament</strong></p> <p>This ligament can be torn because of a rotation force in the knee. It is normally a non-contact injury and often occurs when a player is sharply changing direction or if he lands on one foot while the body is twisting over it. Paul Gascoigne tore the anterior cruciate ligaments in his right knee in the 1991 FA Cup final and took 16 months to recover before finally making his debut for Lazio. Rehab consists of surgery followed by physiotherapy.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>Six months in best case scenario but, if other ligaments and/or cartilage are affected, it could be up to 18 months.</p> <p><strong>Achilles tendon</strong></p> <p>Pain can occur due to degenerative changes in the tendon which can affect function but does not necessarily stop someone playing. The tendon can also rupture completely and can happen when a player sprints or lands from a jump and it is forcibly overstretched. Julien Faubert joined West Ham from Bordeaux for \u00a36.1m last summer but ruptured his Achilles in a pre-season friendly on July 17. He did not play a Premier League game until January 12 and made only eight first-team appearances all season. For a rupture: surgery, then physio. Otherwise strength exercises can be used to load the tendon to treat the degenerative changes.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>6-8 months with a rupture.</p> <p><strong>Broken metatarsal</strong></p> <p>Made famous by David Beckham in 2002 and has become increasingly common among footballers. The seriousness of the injury depends on which metatarsal is broken, with the fifth being the worst. Beckham broke his fifth metatarsal against Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a on April 10, 2002 after being tackled by Aldo Duscher and did not play again until the World Cup, on June 2. Gary Neville, on the other hand, broke his metatarsal in April 2006 and has played only one competitive first-team game since. Rehab involves casting and possibly surgery. Machines that can speed up bone healing are also used.</p> <p><strong>Player out for </strong><br>Six weeks is the best case scenario but if the bone doesn't heal, it could be a year.</p> <p><strong>Shin splints </strong></p> <p>A complex problem comprising of either pain from the muscles around the shin, traction of the sheath around the bone or even bone stress itself, or a combination of these. Kieron Dyer's problems started in 2002 and plagued him until the end of the 2002-03 season, although he often played through the pain. Treatment must address why the injury occurred to prevent recurrence.</p> <p><strong>Player out for </strong><br>Won't necessarily stop player playing but will affect performance and can last whole season.</p> <p><strong>Calf strain</strong></p> <p>Most commonly occurs when a player is sprinting. John Terry's return to Chelsea's first team in January 2007 after a back injury was delayed after he picked up a calf strain in training. It was not serious, however, and he returned to action two weeks later.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>2-12 weeks.</p> <p><strong>Groin strain</strong></p> <p>Rarely a simple strain of the muscle. Involves repeated strains because of poor control of movement around the hip region. Andrew Johnson limped out of Everton's defeat at Fulham on March 18, 2008 with a groin strain and did not play again for three weeks. Rehab involves correction of muscle strength around hip and possibly altering running and kicking technique. It is a complex problem and although players sometimes have a hernia repair (surgery) this does not always fix the problem. </p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>Difficult to say. Can plague a player for several seasons. </p> <p><strong>Broken ankle</strong></p> <p>Can happen when a player lands awkwardly or if the body twists over a fixed foot. Normally the ligaments are also affected, which makes the injury worse. Alan Shearer broke his ankle and injured his ankle ligaments in a pre-season friendly in 1997 and did not play until the following year, but made a complete recovery and led England's attack at the 1998 World Cup. Rehab consists of casting or surgery, depending on the fracture, and then physio.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>From 10 weeks for a simple fracture to up to a year.</p> <p><strong>Broken rib </strong></p> <p>Caused by a direct hit, either by landing on it or direct contact by an opponent. Extremely painful and the rib cannot be immobilised like other bones when fractured (as ribs are essential for breathing). Freddie Ljungberg suffered a broken rib when Newcastle's Steven Taylor trod on him on April 26, 2008 and faced an uphill battle to be fit for the opening Euro 2008 game on June 10. He did play, albeit aided by painkilling injections. Rehab is rest and painkillers (but not anti-inflammatories as this affects bone healing). </p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>From six weeks.</p> <h2>Need to know</h2> <p><strong>Muscles and ligament injuries can be graded according to severity</strong></p> <p><strong>Grade I</strong> Overstretching and micro-tearing of fibres - a simple sprain orstrain. Player will be back in a few weeks</p> <p><strong>Grade II</strong> Partial tear of fibres - more tissue damage so: more rest and a longer recovery time</p> <p><strong>Grade III</strong> Complete tear - a severe injury which can affect surrounding tissue and may require surgery</p> <p><strong>Management of acute injuries</strong></p> <p><strong>RICE</strong> Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation</p> <p><strong>Fractures</strong></p> <p>A common misconception is that a fracture and a break are different injuries.

  "<p>They fettered his mouth with chains,<br>And tied his hands to the rock of the dead.<br>They said: You're a murderer.<br>They took his food, his clothes and his banners,<br>And threw him into the well of the dead.<br>They said: You're a thief.<br>They threw him out of every port,<br>And took away his young beloved.<br>And then they said: You're a refugee.</p> <p>With poems from the 1960s such as this, Mahmoud Darwish, who has died in a Texas hospital aged 67 of complications following open-heart surgery, did as much as anyone to forge a Palestinian national consciousness, and especially after the six-day war of June 1967. His poems have been taught in schools throughout the Arab world and set to music; some of his lines have become part of the fabric of modern Arabic culture.</p> <p>Darwish was born in the village of Birwa, east of Acre. His parents were from middle-ranking peasant families. Both were preoccupied with work on their land and Mahmoud was effectively brought up by his grandfather. When he was six, Israeli armed forces assaulted the village and Mahmoud fled with his family to Lebanon, living first in Jezzin and then in Damour. </p> <p>When, the following year, the family returned to their occupied homeland, their village had been obliterated: two settlements had been erected on the land, and they settled in Deir al-Asad in Galilee. There were no books in Darwish's own home and his first exposure to poetry was through listening to an itinerant singer on the run from the Israeli army. He was encouraged to write poetry by an elder brother.</p> <p>Israeli Arabs lived under military rule from 1948 to 1986. They were curbed in their movements and in any political activity. As a child, Darwish grew up aware that as far as those in control were concerned he, his family and his fellow Palestinians were second-class citizens. Yet they were still expected to join in Israeli state celebrations. While at school, he wrote a poem for an anniversary of the foundation of the state. The poem was an outcry from an Arab boy to a Jewish boy. \"I don't remember the poem,\" he recalled many years later, \"but I remember the idea of it; you can play in the sun as you please, and have your toys, but I can't. You have a house, and I have none. You have celebrations, but I have none. Why can't we play together?\" He recalls being summoned to see the military governor, who threatened him: \"If you go on writing such poetry, I'll stop your father working in the quarry.\"</p> <p>But relations with individual Jewish Israelis varied. Some he liked, including at least one of his teachers, some he loathed. Relationships with Jewish girls were easier than with girls from the more conservative Arab families.</p> <p>At his school, contemporaries remember him being very good in Hebrew. Israeli Palestinian culture was cut off from mainstream Arab developments. Arab poets who did impress him were the Iraqis Abd al-Wahhab al-Bayati and Badr Shakir al-Sayyab. Exciting innovations such as the Beirut group that clustered round the magazine al-Shi'r and the prosodic and thematic innovations of the Syrian poets Adonis (Ali Ahmad Said Asbar) and Nizar Kabbani did not reach the beleaguered Palestinians directly. Instead, much of Darwish's early reading of the poetry of the world outside Palestine was through the medium of Hebrew. Through Hebrew translations he got to know the work of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Pablo Neruda. He also became influenced by Hebrew literature from the Torah to the modern poet Yehuda Amichai.</p> <p>His first poetry symbolised the Palestinian resistance to Israeli rule. His first volumes, Leaves of the Olive Tree (1964), A Lover from Palestine (1966) and End of the Night (1967), were published in Israel. During this time Darwish was a member of the Israeli Communist party, Rakah, and edited the Arabic edition of the party's newspaper, Al-Ittihad. Israeli Palestinians were restricted in any expression of nationalist feeling. Darwish went to prison several times and was frequently under house arrest.</p> <p>His earliest poetry followed classical forms, but, from the mid-1960s, it became populist and direct. He used imagery that he could relate intimately to Palestinian villagers. He wrote of olive groves and orchards, the rocks and plants, basil and thyme. These early poems have a staccato effect, like verbal hand-grenades. In spite of an apparent simplicity, his short poems have several levels of meaning. There is a sense of anger, outrage and injustice, notably in the celebrated Identity Card, in the voice of an Arab man giving his identity number:</p> <p>Write down at the top of the first page:</p> <p>I do not hate people.<br>I steal from no one.<br>However<br>If I am hungry<br>I will eat the flesh of my usurper.<br>Beware beware of my hunger<br>And of my anger.</p> <p>But his poetry also contained irony and a universal humanity. For Darwish the issue of Palestine became a prism for an internationalist feeling. The land and history of Palestine was a summation of millennia, with influences from Canaanites, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Ottoman Turks and British. Throughout all this has survived a core identity of Palestine. He was able to see the Israeli soldier as a victim of circumstances like himself. He expresses the bureaucratic absurdities of an oppressive military occupation.</p> <p>Darwish left Israel in 1971, to the disappointment of many Palestinians, and studied at Moscow University. After a brief period in Cairo he went to Beirut and held a number of jobs with the Palestine Research Centre. He remained in Beirut during the first part of the civil war and left with Yasser Arafat and the PLO in 1982. He moved on to Tunis and Paris, and became editor-in-chief of the influential literary review Al-Karmel. Although he became a member of the PLO executive committee in 1987 and helped to draft the Palestinian Declaration of Statehood, he tried to keep away from factionalism. \"I am a poet with a particular perspective on reality,\" he said.</p> <p>His literary work was changing. He wrote short stories and developed a style of writing poems that was a mixture of observation, humanity and irony. He argued that poetry was easier to write than prose. But the poetry continued inspired by incidents or relationships. There is often an optimism against all the odds in his works of the 1980s:</p> <p>Streets encircle us<br>As we walk among the bombs.<br>Are you used to death?<br>I'm used to life and to endless desire.<br>Do you know the dead?<br>I know the ones in love.</p> <p>During his Paris years Darwish wrote Memory for Forgetfulness, a memoir of Beirut under the saturation Israeli bombing of 1982 which has been translated into English. A poem in prose, it is a medley of wit and rage, with reflections on violence and exile. </p> <p>His later work became more mystical and less particularly concerned with Palestine. Often it was preoccupied with human mortality. He was careless of his own health and suffered heart attacks in 1984 and in early 1998.</p> <p>Darwish resigned from the PLO executive committee over the 1993 Oslo Agreements between Israel and the PLO, which he saw as a \"risky accord\". He was able to return to Israel to see his aged mother in 1995. The Israeli authorities also gave him permission for an unlimited stay in the self-ruling parts of the Palestinian West Bank, and he spent his last years in Ramallah and Amman, the capital of Jordan. </p> <p>In 2000 the Israeli ministry of education proposed to introduce his works into the school curriculum, but met strong opposition from rightwing protesters. The then prime minister, Ehud Barak, said the country was not ready. </p> <p>Darwish's work has been translated into Hebrew and, in July 2007, Darwish returned to Israel on a visit and gave a reading of his poetry to 2,000 people in Haifa. He deplored the Hamas victory in Gaza the previous month. \"We have triumphed,' he observed with grim irony. \"Gaza has won its independence from the West Bank. One people now have two states, two prisons who don't greet each other. We are dressed in executioners' clothes.\"</p> <p>Over the years Darwish received many honours. He was given the Soviet Union's Lotus prize in 1969, and the Lenin peace prize in 1983. He was president of the Union of Palestinian Writers. Married and divorced twice, he had no children; his first wife was the Syrian writer Rana Kabbani, who elegantly translated some of his poetry into English.</p> <p><strong>Margaret Obank writes:</strong> Mahmoud was a completely secular person, rather philosophical, an avid reader, elegant in his dress, and supremely modest in his opinion of himself. He liked to be alone, but would always be ready to speak on the telephone. </p> <p>While I had been reading his poems since the early 1970s, I got to know him through my husband, the Iraqi author Samuel Shimon. Mahmoud supported Banipal, the literary magazine we founded in 1998, and took pride both in issues of the journal and the many dialogues we helpled to promote. </p> <p>It presents work by Arab authors and poets in English for the first time. When we rang Mahmoud three months ago about doing a special issue on him, his reaction was: \"Do you think I deserve that? If you think I do, then I like the idea.\" Now it will be a tribute to him. </p> <p>We were with Mahmoud when he was awarded the Prince Claus Fund of principal prize in Amsterdam in 2004, the theme being asylum and migration. His acceptance speech was both powerful and thoughtful: \"A person can only be born in one place. However, he may die several times elsewhere: in the exiles and prisons, and in a homeland transformed by the occupation and oppression into a nightmare. Poetry is perhaps what teaches us to nurture the charming illusion: how to be reborn out of ourselves over and over again, and use words to construct a better world, a fictitious world that enables us to sign a pact for a permanent and comprehensive peace ... with life.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mahmoud Darwish, poet, born March 15 1941; died August 9 2008</p>",
  "<p>The conflict in the Caucasus yesterday spread to Georgia's second breakaway province of Abkhazia where separatist rebels and the Russian air force launched an all-out attack on Georgian forces. </p> <p>Abkhazia's pro-Moscow separatist leader, Sergei Bagapsh, said his troops had launched a major \"military operation\" to oust Georgian troops from the mountainous Kodori Gorge, a strategic foothold in the breakaway Black Sea territory. </p> <p>He said \"around 1,000 special Abkhaz troops\" were involved. They were attacking Georgian positions using \"warplanes, multiple rocket launchers and artillery\".</p> <p>\"The operation will enter the next phase as planned. And you will learn about that,\" he said, adding that he would create a \"humanitarian corridor\" allowing residents in the district to flee.</p> <p>The offensive appears to mark a dangerous new front in the conflict between Georgia and Russia.</p> <p>Georgia immediately accused Russia of planning and executing the attack on the Kodori Valley, a small but strategic enclave just inside Abkhazia controlled by Georgian forces since 2006. </p> <p>Georgian interior ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said: \"They have started the operation to storm Kodori gorge.\" Asked who was behind the operation, he replied: \"The Russian army.\"</p> <p>Speaking in Tbilisi, Georgia's parliamentary speaker, David Bakradze, said he had \"irrefutable proof\" that the Russian military was masterminding the \"plan\". He urged residents to stay calm, adding: \"The enemy will be offered all resistance.\"</p> <p>Georgia also said Russia had landed 4,000 troops on Saturday night in Abkhazia, brought from the Black Sea base of Sevastopol. The subtropical enclave on the eastern coast of the Black Sea abuts the Russian resort town of Sochi, where Vladimir Putin has his summer residence.</p> <p> It added that 10 Russian jets had attacked Tbilisi-controlled \"upper Abkhazia\" on Saturday, and Georgian government troops had shot one of them down.</p> <p>The Russian air force also bombarded Chkhalta, the gorge's main administrative centre, where Georgia has installed an alternative pro-Tbilisi Abkhaz government. It also hit the village of Omarishara, which has an airfield, Georgia said.</p> <p>Russia yesterday insisted that it did not want to \"escalate the conflict\", despite the arrival of 4,000 troops on Saturday night.</p> <p>\"We do not intend to take the initiative in escalating the conflict in this region. We are primarily interested in stabilisation there [in Abkhazia],\" Russian army spokesman Anatoly Nogovitsyn told the agency Interfax.</p> <p>There seems little doubt that Russia is determined to evict Georgian troops from the Kodori Gorge. Its aim appears to be to restore the de facto border between Georgia and Abkhazia - and to boost the separatist government based in the seaside town of Sukhumi.</p> <p>The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, said he was profoundly concerned about tensions in Abkhazia. Ukraine also warned that it might not allow Russian ships deployed off Abkhazia to return to their base in the Crimea.</p> <p>Abkhazia has enjoyed de facto independence since driving Georgian forces out in a 1992-93 civil war. Like South Ossetia, Abkhazia has received help and assistance from Russia, with most residents now holding Russian passports.</p>",
  "<p>Gori, the Georgian town close to the border with South Ossetia, was largely deserted last night after thousands of residents fled from Russian air attack.</p> <p>\"The town and many nearby villages are too dangerous. [People] are sleeping in the open,\" Saba Tsitsikashvili, editor of Kartlis Khma, a local paper, said in a phone interview. \"There are also many wounded in the villages. They need help. No one knows how many are dead.\" </p> <p>Gori is the Georgian army's main staging post on the way to and from the frontline. Russian bombers had been heard every night since the crisis escalated, Tsitsikashvili said, and were in the air again last night, in spite of a ceasefire on the Georgian side, he added.</p> <p>In Tibilisi, the Georgian capital, people were angry at what they saw as a Russian invasion aimed at undermining the country's sovereignty and bringing it to heel.</p> <p>\"What is happening is not because of the separatist regions, which have been a headache for Georgia for over a decade now, but because of democracy in Georgia,\" said Giorgi, a 30-year-old lawyer. \"Russia hates democracy, it's always been an authoritarian state and always will be. This Russian aggression is a fight against democracy, and the world must defend democracy.\"</p> <p>\"Russia has always wanted to see Georgia on its knees, but it will never achieve that,\" vowed Emzari, a 45-year-old technician. \"I hope that Russia will retreat. I hope it will break its neck here in the Caucasus.\"</p> <p>Hundreds gathered for a second day of anti-Russian protests in the central Rose Revolution Square after a text-message campaign. \"Let's stand together against Russian aggression and occupation, and cheer our troops!\" the message read. </p> <p>Many people were also disillusioned by what they considered the feeble reaction of the west - particularly the United States, Georgia's main international ally. Many complained that Georgia had sent 2,000 troops to fight in Iraq, but when Georgia came under attack, Washington could only offer words in return.</p> <p>\"We've been hearing all these years that we've got strong and powerful friends across the ocean but it turned out these stories were just a bluff,\" said unemployed Valiko, 57.</p> <p>\"We may be stupid, we may have made mistakes, but will the US and Europe really let Russia get away with attacking another country?\" demanded 26-year-old student Vakhtang.</p>",
  "<p>They call Clare Josa the JK Rowling of root vegetables. </p> <p>Well, some people do: having started <a href=\"http://vegbox-recipes.co.uk\">vegbox-recipes.co.uk</a>, Josa has now launched an organic-box helpline that users pay for with an annual subscription, with conference calls for generalists (how do I make my children eat these items?) and specialists (will this swede season never end?).</p> <p>Josa started cooking when she became vegetarian at 11, but by profession was a mechanical engineer, and there is an attractive, un-organic-movement precision to the way she approaches things. But can she help you to deal with your veggie glut? To road test this enterprise, I start with an example from my real life: what shall I do with seven very ripe bananas? \"Banana cake. You don't have to use too much sugar, and if you use wholemeal flour, you get a really delicious taste.\" </p> <p>OK. Another one: I have a squash and five carrots, and I want to roast them, but I feel bad about sticking the oven on hot for an hour and a half. So do I waste the veg or waste the energy? \"Make a soup!\" (Good point.) </p> <p>A question for the future: say I have a huge swede, there's only three of us in the house, and the two who can talk definitely don't like it? \"One of my favourite things is to chop it up, mash it with potatoes, butter and pepper, keep it simple, then freeze it.\" Why do mashed things freeze well? \"When you freeze things, the water content expands as it becomes ice, so the structure <br>is destroyed and it becomes mushy when it defrosts.\"</p> <p>I guess I am still a bit dubious about whether or not you need this much hand-holding to get through some swede. Josa is profoundly knowledgeable, it's true, but while the package also includes worksheets and stuff, part of me wants to shout: \"Don't spend \u00a399 on this. Get a book out of the library!\" </p> <p>Mind you, Josa says that, having bought her cupboard stuff in bulk, her weekly fresh-food shop only costs \u00a320. If she can tutor you to feed three people on that, it'll be well worth it.</p>",
  "<p>The Museum of London celebrates Time Out's 40th birthday this week with an exhibition of classic covers - over 200 of them. The cover is, as the founder and sole proprietor Tony Elliott used to say when cutting the marketing department's budget yet again, the best advertising poster the magazine could have.</p> <p>They also set the tone for the magazine. Since Pearce Marchbank's reign as creative director in the 70s, Time Out's covers have been, at their best, irreverent and lateral-thinking, as well as mere sales tools. They reflect the infinite variety and playful sophistication of London life - and the fun of working on a magazine as chaotic as the capital itself. </p> <p>For me the tone was set when I joined Time Out as a lowly sub in 1987 by the then editor, a high-living Australian called Don Atyeo, who employed the foul-mouthed comedian Jerry Sadowitz as a columnist and in his first meeting outdid him by splitting his coffee cup with a sword. It was also Atyeo who had allowed the news team on to the roof, with balaclavas and fake guns, for a photoshoot that was interrupted by Special Branch descending in three helicopters, heavily armed, to subdue the \"terrorists\". </p> <p><strong>Playful mischief</strong></p> <p>Publishing has changed since those days, when Atyeo's co-editor, Jerome Burne, published a review by Cosmo Landesman that was highly critical of a street entertainers' festival that Time Out's marketing department were sponsoring - unthinkable in these times when editors are expected to be adept in \"leveraging cross-platform synergies to increase their market footprint\". The marketing director, Bob Wilson, returning to the office from \"a good lunch\" as he put it to me last week, punched Burne in the face. Wilson was banned from setting foot on the editorial floor; Burne left Time Out altogether.</p> <p>And by what considered process of painstaking recruitment was I promoted from deputy editor in 1992, at 28 years old? The outside candidate they initially chose, Simon Mills, sent a fax from the ski slopes literally the day before he was due to start as editor: awfully sorry, but he had decided to stay at the Sunday Times after all. Since the fax was dictated and so not signed, and since it was exactly the sort of practical joke that Time Out journos would play, the general manager spent a frantic 12 hours checking its authenticity before offering me the job in the morning. </p> <p>I tried, over the next seven years and 350-odd covers, to infuse the magazine with some of that playful mischief. Because Atyeo had the maxim that \"only American stars sell\", I was determined to promote Brits wherever possible: we splashed early on Four Weddings and Trainspotting; led the Britpop charge with covers on Blur, Suede, Oasis, Pulp, Spice Girls and the Verve; and backed YBAs and alternative comedy with Damien Hirst, Eddie Izzard and Lee Evans. </p> <p>I also nicked an idea I had seen badly executed on an American magazine, which has since become a regular tactic in British magazine publishing: running a choice of covers. We did a north v south London issue (shot by a brash young photographer named Rankin, who did many TO covers of that era). And when we did Vic and Bob, one cover featured Bob Mortimer grinning in profile with his hand out of shot, while the other had - literally - the punchline: Vic Reeves having his glasses knocked flying by a disembodied fist. </p> <p>The best covers were known as \"two-bottle ideas\"- it always seemed to be on that second lunchtime bottle of wine that the best brainstorms happened. The consumer editor suggested doing a feature on suits. How to sell it? Two bottles later, I had it: Reservoir Togs. We ended up with Rufus Sewell, Jane Horrocks, Eddie Izzard, Shaun Ryder, Brett Anderson and others walking tall and dressed to kill in a re-enactment of Tarantino's film poster. </p> <p>Other two-bottle ideas included crucifying the trip-hop musician Tricky for Easter; hiring a Routemaster bus to ferry the Beautiful South around London, Summer Holiday-style, picking up random passers-by; getting the comedian Donna McPhail to run for election in a Time Out party for London; assembling a team of celebrities to play football against a Time Out XI, on the grounds that you can tell more about someone from how they play than what they say; and combining the release of Wayne's World with the opening of a Magritte exhibition by picturing a guitar floating over blue sky and white clouds with the inscription: \"This is a guitar - not!\". </p> <p>And because this was an age before computer graphics, when Photoshop was in its infancy (when we shot the Spice Girls hitchhiking and comped them together, eagle-eyed readers noticed that one had lost a leg), our designers had physically to make beer labels and cigarette packets, get ice sculpted into a Christmas snowflake, make mosaic murals in their garden and commission real neon signs.</p> <p><strong>Liquid lunches</strong></p> <p>The media landscape is much changed now. Everywhere has become more professional, more safe, more scared. Long liquid lunches no longer appear on expense claims. Pressure is intense, most obviously from the internet but also from the explosion of new publications - would you believe there was once a world without Empire and Q, where men's monthlies ran blokes not babes on the cover, and newspaper arts pages thought it beneath them to interview \"mere\" film stars?</p> <p>At Time Out, the very professional new publisher, Mark Elliott (no relation), peppers his talk with words such as \"trending\", \"retail chain\" and \"churn\". The mag is now sold, like its New York counterpart, mostly on subscription, and the next ABC is expected to be a modest 74,000. And yet the lunacy lives on in the quixotic columns of Michael Hodges.</p> <p>The agonising decision to run all Time Out's articles and listings free on the web is said to have paid off - Elliott insists it's hardly dented sales of the mag, while the site records a very healthy 1.5 million unique users a month. And the guides division, as well as Time Outs licensed in foreign cities, continues to reproduce faster than Duracell rabbits.</p> <p>Is it only wishful thinking to imagine there might still be a place for some of that divine cover madness on the newsstands? That a magazine might stand out if it were brave enough to do something other than slap on a pretty woman's face and plaster her with coverlines? No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public, they say. But for a while at least, as circulation rose to a highly profitable ABC of 106,000 every week (more than 400,000 a month, for a regional magazine!), I'd like to think we proved them wrong. </p> <p>\u00b7 Dominic Wells was editor of Time Out from 1992 to 1999. <a href=\"mailto:DominicRAWells@aol.com\">DominicRAWells@aol.com</a> <br><a href=\"www.museumoflondon.org.uk\">www.museumoflondon.org.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll: classic Time Out covers</strong></p> <p><strong>Eddie Izzard</strong><br>Proof that, with a good photographer (Perou) and a willing subject, you can produce terrific celebrity covers. Eddie Izzard was interviewed by the Buzzcocks regular Phill Jupitus - who delivered excellent copy with the cheery greeting, \"'Scoop' Jupitus, Journalist Monkey Boy at your service\".</p> <p><strong>Drugs</strong><br>Journalists kept a diary under the influence (Miranda Sawyer's ecstasy report was inspired), and the SellOut section compiled a consumer chart. The cover was shot as one image - \"the only time I've managed to claim drugs on expenses\", remembers the then art director, Jeremy Leslie.</p> <p><strong>Weird Sex</strong><br>Coverlines such as Future Sex, Art or Porn? and Auto Erotica (for Cronenberg's film Crash) would spike sales by 20% or more. For Weird Sex, which had four alternate covers, the art director Kirk Teasdale got free images from more than 100 artists and photographers.</p> <p><strong>Prince</strong><br>Prince never gave interviews. But this was not Prince, this was The Artist Formerly Known as Prince. Pete Paphides was permitted neither tape recorder nor notebook, so frantically scribbled down his remarks straight after. We were also refused a photoshoot, so printed the unpronounceable symbol by which he wished to be known. </p> <p><strong>Tank Girl</strong><br>Jamie \"Gorillaz\" Hewlett not only gave us chapter and verse on \"how Tank Girl got screwed by Hollywood\" but illustrated our cover too. He later did a two-page strip for us on Jarvis Cocker's sex life, but that's another story...</p>",

  "<p>We need to get prepared for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/06/climatechange.scienceofclimatechange\">four degrees of global warming</a>, Bob Watson told the Guardian last week. At first sight this looks like wise counsel from the climate science adviser to Defra. But the idea that we could adapt to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/carbonemissions.climatechange\">4C rise</a> is absurd and dangerous. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climatechange\">Global warming</a> on this scale would be a catastrophe that would mean, in the immortal words that Chief Seattle probably never spoke, \"the end of living and the beginning of survival\" for humankind. Or perhaps the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/08/kingsnorthclimatecamp.climatechange\">beginning of our extinction</a>.</p> <p>The collapse of the polar ice caps would become inevitable, bringing long-term <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2007/dec/05/climatechange.flooding?picture=331454811\">sea level rises</a> of 70-80 metres. All the world's coastal plains would be lost, complete with ports, cities, transport and industrial infrastructure, and much of the world's most productive farmland. The world's geography would be transformed much as it was at the end of the last ice age, when sea levels rose by about 120 metres to create the Channel, the North Sea and Cardigan Bay out of dry land. Weather would become extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe droughts, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/08/climatechange.flooding\">floods</a> and hurricanes. The Earth's carrying capacity would be hugely reduced. Billions would undoubtedly die.</p> <p>Watson's call was supported by the government's former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, who warned that \"if we get to a four-degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase\". This is a remarkable understatement. The climate system is already experiencing significant feedbacks, notably the summer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/10/climatechange.arctic\">melting of the Arctic sea ice</a>. The more the ice melts, the more sunshine is absorbed by the sea, and the more the Arctic warms. And as the Arctic warms, the release of billions of tonnes of methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas 70 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years \u2013 captured under melting permafrost is already under way.</p> <p>To see how far this process could go, look 55.5m years to the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, when a global temperature increase of 6C coincided with the release of about 5,000 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, both as CO2 and as methane from bogs and seabed sediments. Lush subtropical forests grew in polar regions, and sea levels rose to 100m higher than today. It appears that an initial warming pulse triggered other warming processes. Many scientists warn that this historical event may be analogous to the present: the warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth.</p> <p>But what are we to do? All our policies to date to tackle global warming have been miserable failures. The Kyoto protocol has created a vast carbon market but done little to reduce emissions. The main effect of the EU's emissions trading scheme has been to transfer about \u20ac30bn or more from consumers to Europe's biggest polluters, the power companies. The EU and US foray into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/biofuels\">biofuels</a> has, at huge cost, increased greenhouse gas <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbonemissions\">emissions</a> and created a world <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/food\">food crisis</a>, causing starvation in many poor countries.</p> <p>So are all our efforts doomed to failure? Yes, so long as our governments remain craven to special interests, whether <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/10/emissionstrading.utilities\">carbon traders</a> or fossil fuel companies. The carbon market is a valuable tool, but must be subordinate to climatic imperatives. The truth is that to prevent runaway greenhouse warming, we will have to leave most of the world's fossil fuels in the ground, especially carbon-heavy coal, oil shales and tar sands. The fossil fuel and power companies must be faced down. </p> <p>Global problems need global solutions, and we also need an effective replacement for the failed Kyoto protocol. The entire Kyoto system of national allocations is obsolete because of the huge volumes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy\">energy</a> embodied in products traded across national boundaries. It also presents a major obstacle to any new agreement \u2013 as demonstrated by the 2008 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/08/g8\">G8 meeting</a> in Japan that degenerated into a squabble over national emission rights.</p> <p>The answer? Scrap national allocations and place a single global cap on greenhouse gas emissions, applied \"upstream\" \u2013 for instance, at the oil refinery, coal-washing station and cement factory. Sell permits up to that cap in a global auction, and use the proceeds to finance solutions to climate change \u2013 accelerating the use of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy\">renewable energy</a>, raising energy efficiency, protecting forests, promoting climate-friendly farming, and researching geoengineering technologies. And commit hundreds of billions of dollars per year to finance adaptation to climate change, especially in poor countries.</p> <p>Such a package of measures would allow us to achieve zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and long-term stabilisation at 350 parts per million of CO2 equivalent. This avoids the economic pain that a cap-and-trade system alone would cause, and targets assistance at the poor, who are least to blame and most need help. The permit auction would raise about $1 trillion per year, enough to finance a spread of solutions. At a quarter of the world's annual oil spending, it is a price well worth paying.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oliver Tickell's book Kyoto2 has just been published <a href=\"http://www.kyoto2.org\">kyoto2.org</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To read Bj\u00f6rn Lomborg's response to this article, go <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange\">here</a></p>",
  "<p>Russian troops today took control of Tskhinvali, the ruined capital of the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia, after Georgian troops withdrew in the face of an overwhelming Russian counter-attack.</p> <p>The Georgian retreat came as Russia poured troops and tanks across its southern border into the rebel province and bombed Georgian targets. Tbilisi attempted last week to retake South Ossetia, which broke away from Georgia in the 1990s.</p> <p>\"As of today most of the city [Tskhinvali] is controlled by Russian peacekeeping forces,\" Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, of the Russian general staff, told a briefing in Moscow.</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, ordered a ceasefire to begin at 5am this morning (1am BST), after seemingly underestimating the strength of the response from Moscow. Georgia's foreign ministry told the Russian ambassador it was now ready for immediate negotiations on a \"termination of hostilities\".</p> <p>However, fighting is still continuing tonight despite the Georgian offer of ceasefire. A Reuters reporter in the town of Gori, just south of South Ossetia, reported heavy bombardment of areas around Tskhinvali this evening, although it was not clear who was firing.</p> <p>Russian planes again bombed the Tbilisi military airport and a nearby aviation plant. One bomb exploded near the runway of the civilian international airport, although Moscow denied targeting that facility. </p> <p>Futhermore, there are reports from news agencies, quoting Russia's defence ministry, that the Russian navy has sunk a Georgian boat carrying missile launchers after a skirmish in the Black Sea.</p> <p>Earlier today in an interview with BBC World, Saakashvili rejected the notion that his call for a ceasefire signified a military defeat.</p> <p>\"Our troops are in good shape, there has been a very organised relocation and Russia has lost 20 aircraft,\" Saakashvili said, but he acknowledged that his country could not compete militarily with Russia.</p> <p>\"They [our forces] have been withdrawn completely because of the heavy casualties Georgia has suffered,\" the Georgian interior ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said.</p> <p>The head of Georgia's security council, Alexander Lomaia, said Georgian troops had moved to new positions outside South Ossetia. \"They are outside the region entirely,\" he said.</p> <p>In Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian government reported a lull in fighting and said morgues were receiving the dead.</p> <p>\"The humanitarian situation is horrifying. We have no cameras and cannot document what we can see but the morgues are busy receiving streams of dead bodies,\" the government spokesperson Irina Gagloyeva said.</p> <p>About 50 ambulances took wounded Georgian soldiers from a military hospital in Gori, a town just outside South Ossetia, to Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.</p> <p>The AFP news agency reported Lomaia saying that Russian troops were heading to Gori, but he denied having said this. Gori, about 40 miles northwest of Tbilisi, is just south of the border with South Ossetia. The largest Georgian town close to the region, Gori is an important strategic link between eastern and western Georgia.</p> <p>Lomaia said Georgia had met the demands of the US and France, the current holder of the EU presidency, who both called for a withdrawal of troops from the separatist region.</p> <p>\"We have fulfilled our side of the initiative. The Russians have not, but on the contrary have increased their military presence,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The Russians, despite the size of the forces that have entered Georgia, have failed to defeat our troops. But we have to be realistic, it is going to be very difficult to face up to them,\" he said.</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, was to arrive in Tbilisi this evening with his Finnish counterpart, Alexander Stubb, who represents the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p> <p>Kouchner is to submit a three-point plan based on an immediate cessation of hostilities, the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and the reestablishment of the situation that existed before.</p> <p>The UN security council met today for the fourth day in a row to try to resolve the situation.</p> <p>The Nato secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, said Russia had violated Georgia's territorial integrity in South Ossetia and had used excessive force.</p> <p>De Hoop Scheffer called for talks to restore Georgian control over its breakaway province and expressed concern about \"the disproportionate use of force\" - an apparent reference to Russian shelling and air attacks.</p> <p>Some observers feared Russia might not be satisfied until it saw the overthrow of Saakashvili, who has enraged Moscow with his pro-western stance and bid to bring his small nation into Nato.</p> <p>All over the region, there was worrying evidence that the conflict was widening. On the other side of the country, Georgia's other separatist region of Abkhazia sent forces into the Kodori gorge, the only part of Abkhazia controlled by Georgia.</p> <p>Saakashvili accused Russia of having 150 tanks and 10,000 troops in Abkhazia to support the separatists.</p> <p>\"No dialogue is possible with the current Georgian leadership,\" said the Abkhaz leader, Sergei Bagapsh. \"They are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in South Ossetia, the genocide of the Ossetian people.</p> <p>\"We have received proposals for some sort of contact from the Georgian side. But we see yet again that they fail to grasp the meaning of what happened in the early 1990s [when Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke away] and they do not understand or do not want to understand what is going on now.\" Bagapsh claimed that women and children from villages inside Georgia were actually heading into Abkhazia to seek refuge.</p> <p>Out in the Black Sea, off the Abkhazian coast, the Russian fleet, including the cruiser Moskva, was gathering. A naval source told Echo Moskvi radio this was not a blockade, as that would be an act of war and Russia was not at war with Georgia. The ships were there in case refugees needed help, he said.</p> <p>The explanation given to Interfax by a Russian navy source seemed more likely. \"The crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach Georgia by sea,\" he said.</p> <p>Moscow appears to have calculated that the west, tied up in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and dependent on Russia for oil and gas, will do nothing to support Georgia beyond expressing impotent concern.</p> <p>Ukraine, an ally of Georgia, said it reserved the right to bar Russian's Black Sea warships dispatched to the Abkhazian coast from returning to their Ukrainian base of Sevastopol, Interfax reported.</p> <p>\"Ukraine reserves the right to bar warships and vessels which could take part in the action from returning to Ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved,\" it quoted the Ukrainian foreign ministry as saying. On Saturday, in a statement that hinted how the conflict could widen still further, Russia took a swipe at Ukraine, accusing it of \"arming the Georgians to the teeth\".</p>",
  "<p>The conflict in the Caucasus today spread to Georgia's second breakaway province of Abkhazia, where separatist rebels and the Russian air force launched an all-out attack on Georgian forces.</p> <p>Abkhazia's pro-Moscow separatist leader Sergei Bagapsh said his troops had launched a major \"military operation\" to force Georgian troops out of the mountainous Kodori gorge, which Georgian forces control as a strategic foothold in the breakaway Black Sea territory.</p> <p>He said \"around 1,000 special Abkhaz troops\" were involved. They were attacking and pounding Georgian positions using \"warplanes, multiple rocket launchers and artillery\", he said.</p> <p>\"The operation will enter the next phase as planned. And you will learn about that,\" he promised today, adding that he would create a \"humanitarian corridor\" allowing residents living in the district to flee.</p> <p>The offensive appeared to mark a dangerous new front in the conflict between Georgia and Russia - following Georgia's apparent withdrawal from its other breakaway region of South Ossetia today.</p> <p>Georgia immediately accused Russia of planning and executing the attack on the Kodori valley - a small but strategic enclave just inside Abkhazia, and controlled by Georgian forces since 2006.</p> <p>Georgian interior ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said: \"They have started the operation to storm Kodori gorge.\" Asked who was behind the operation, he replied: \"The Russian army.\"</p> <p>Speaking in Tbilisi, Georgia's parliamentary speaker, David Bakradze, said he had \"irrefutable proof\" that the Russian military was masterminding the \"plan\". He urged residents to stay calm, adding \"the enemy will be offered all resistance\".</p> <p>In an interview on BBC World, the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, accused Russia of having 150 tanks and 10,000 troops in Abkhazia.</p> <p>Georgia earlier said Russia had landed 4,000 troops in Abkhazia last night - a subtropical exclave on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, which abuts the Russian resort town of Sochi, where Vladimir Putin has his summer residence. </p> <p>It added that 10 Russian jets had pounded Tbilisi-controlled 'upper Abkhazia' on Saturday, and that Georgian government troops had shot one of them down.</p> <p>The Russian air force bombarded Chkhalata - the gorge's main administrative centre, where Georgia has installed an alternative pro-Tbilisi Abkhaz government. It also hit the airdrome village of Omarishara, Georgia said.</p> <p>Russia today insisted it did not want to \"escalate the conflict\". Army spokesman Anatoly Nogovitsyn told the agency Interfax: \"We do not intend to take the initiative in escalating the conflict in this region. We are primarily interested in stabilisation [in Abkhazia].\"</p> <p>But there seems little doubt that Russia is determined to evict Georgian troops from the Kodori gorge. Its aim appears to be to restore the de facto border between Georgia and Abkhazia - and to boost the pro-Russian separatist government based in the seaside town of Sukhumi.</p> <p>Abkhazia has enjoyed de facto independence since driving Georgian forces out in a 1992-3 civil war. Like South Ossetia, it has received help and assistance from Russia, with most residents now holding Russian passports.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin recognised Abkhazia as a legal entity in April - a move that enraged Tbilisi, which accused him of trying to annex the territory.</p> <p>The UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon said he was profoundly concerned over growing tensions in Abkhazia.</p> <p>Ukraine also warned that it might not allow Russian ships deployed off Abkhazia to return to their base in the Crimea.</p>",

It was designed to curb wage-inflation induced by a shortage of labourers, who had deserted the fair fields of the land for the sweeter pastures of the afterlife. </p> <p>The statute required every able-bodied person under the age of 60 with no means of subsistence to work for whoever wanted their labour. No alms were to be given to able-bodied beggars. A \"vagrant serf\" could be compelled into the employment of anyone who claimed him. In this legislation, says historian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Tuchman\">Barbara Tuchman</a>, lay the germ of later laws against trade unions and combinations of workers, who might \"conspire\" to make collective demands on employers. </p> <p>Although labour shortage induced by plague was different in origin from that created by the economic \"success\" of the 21st century, the problem it posed remains. While in the 14th century, it was necessary to set wages at a rate that prevailed before the plague, in this enlightened age no such draconian measure was required; migrants from Eastern Europe compliantly sustained the low-wage economy. </p> <p>The population of England fell by one-third in the 14th century, and recovered only in the 16th. With the re-emergence of \"surplus\" labour, and the removal of much charitable giving earlier provided by monasteries and religious foundations, punitive enactments against the poor and workless were again introduced. In the 1530s, the old and disabled poor were given a licence to beg. In the same decade, \"vagabonds\" were to be whipped until blood was drawn. For a third offence (a premature \"three-strikes and you're out\" policy), they could be hanged; a punishment soon withdrawn. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ditext.com/morris/1563.html\">Statute of Artificers of 1563</a> reaffirmed many principles of the Statute of Labourers, especially the regulation of labour and limits on wages. Everyone between the ages of 12 and 60 was compelled to work. Those without a job were to be employed by a local farmer for a year. No one could leave her or his community without permission, and wages were set for all artificers, servants, labourers, workmen and apprentices. The Statute demonstrates the inseparability of the relationship between poverty and work, which has preoccupied the ruling classes of Britain for three-quarters of a millennium.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/elizpl.html\">Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601</a> made a distinction between the \"impotent\" poor, the idle and the able-bodied. It also firmly located responsibility for the care of \"every poor old, blind, lame and impotent person\" with the parents or grandparents of the sufferer, \"at their own charge\"; a concern which haunts present-day efforts to regulate the equivalent of the improvident poor \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/01/children\">parenting classes</a>\", contracts, covenants and all the other paraphernalia aimed at the neglectful and indifferent.</p> <p>Overseers of the poor were appointed by each parish to make sure the sick, aged and needy received assistance. Since these were local responsibilities, it was inevitable that some parishes would be more generous than others. Poor people drifted to where they might receive better treatment. <a href=\"http://www.institutions.org.uk/poor_law_unions/the_poor_law1.htm\">The Settlement Act of 1622</a> gave parishes the power to return paupers to their home parish, unless they had a \"settlement certificate\". Efforts to control the physical movement of the vagrant young today is replicated in antisocial behaviour orders, a desultory attempt to recreate a kind of \"settlement\" act, which would keep them at home after dark.</p> <p>Even clearer echoes of \"settlement\" resonate in discussions of the \"removal\" and \"deportation\" of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/failed-asylumseekers-are-abused-by-private-security-companies-says-report-866879.html\">asylum seekers</a>. The belief that people are bringing hard luck stories to a Britain that is soft, \"an easy touch\", has its origin in the outraged innocents of generous parishes, whose open-heartedness acted as a magnet for the undeserving poor. Despite changes in technology, transformation of the system of production and wealth unparalleled in history, moral interpretations of the world persist: victims are still blamed by persecutors, and the powerful regard themselves as dupes of the cunning poor. </p> <p>The able-bodied were forcibly sent to the workhouse from the 1720s. This led to a severe reduction in out-relief, but by the end of the century, scandals over filth, sickness and promiscuity in workhouses (in some, a majority of children died before their first birthday), the policy changed: only orphans, the infirm and aged sought shelter in its inhospitable walls; the lazy and disreputable were directed to the house of correction.</p> <p>In 1792, the <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/speen.html\">Speenhamland system</a> was introduced, whereby, as the cost of food rose, and the number of paupers increased, the earnings of labourers were topped up \u2013 a kind of primitive anticipation of a minimum wage \u2013 to keep pace with the cost of bread. This created a system of \"indiscriminate relief\", which, some felt, \"demoralised the people\". Nor is the panic over \"unwed mothers\" new. Ever since 1576, the children of unmarried mothers had been assisted by the parish. Towards the end of the 18th century, illegitimacy was so widespread that parishes complained that 40% of their budgets was spent on the offspring of the unwed. </p> <p>Nor should we imagine that our debt to a long and imaginatively punitive attitude towards the labouring poor ends there. A Royal Commission of 1832 resulted in the <a href=\"http://usp.nus.edu.sg/victorian/history/poorlaw/plaatext.html\">Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834</a>. Conditions in the workhouse were to be made \"less eligible\", which meant the most favoured individual in the workhouse must be worse off than the least prosperous outside. The shadow cast by castigation of the poor still haunts the political psyche of Britain; and continuous attrition of benefits to asylum seekers and the workless reincarnate the deterrent of the workhouse, without the expense of monumental buildings. In July, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/21/drugspolicy.jamespurnell\">James Purnell announced</a>, in tones reminiscent of the <a href=\"http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/victorian/history/poorlaw/plcommiss.html\">Poor Law Commission</a>, that \"Work works, and it is only fair we make sure a life on benefits is not an option\".</p> <p>This debate continues to deny the agency of economic, technological and social determinants in producing able-bodied poor, idlers and spongers, welfare cheats, the drug destroyed and the outcast; but sees the individual as responsible for his or her particular form of dereliction. That the cyclical expansion and contraction of the economy influence levels of poverty or worklessness is played down: whenever there is an economic \"downturn\", the first reaction is to turn vengefully upon its victims. As the Poor Law Commission reported in 1834:</p> <blockquote> <p>The dole given to such a person [who would not or could not find work] should be substantially less than the lowest wage offered on the market, and the worker's general condition should be so miserable and so stigmatized so as to motivate the search for employment irrespective of pay or conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Old dilemmas remain. Our responses draw upon extensive lore and myth, much of it lazy and vindictive, slumbering in the shallows of the social subconscious, to be drawn on as required. It seems this Labour government, too, is bent on pursuing sturdy beggars, vagrants and the idle poor: only the language has been \"modernised\". In the process, far from being \"progressive\", it is hurtling backwards to the asperities of Victorian and Elizabethan England, and perhaps, who knows, to the evolution of a techno-feudalism that will unite the 21st century with the medieval world.</p>",

  "<p>How much is the west, and specifically the US, to blame for the war between Russian and Georgia?</p> <p>Quite a lot, according to some commentators, who happen to be American. Steve Clemons at Washington Note sees a <a href=\"http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2008/08/georgiarussia_c/\">\"high quotient of American culpability\"</a>.</p> <p>He argues that when Kosovo declared independence earlier this year, the price of Russian cooperation on other global issues rose considerably and that chances of a clash over Georgia's breakaway border provinces increased dramatically.</p> <blockquote> <p>By pushing Kosovo the way the US did and aggravating nationalist sensitivities, Russia could in reaction be rationally expected to further integrate and cultivate South Ossetia and Abkhazia under de facto Russian control and pull these provinces that border Russia away from the state of Georgia ...</p> <p>At the time, there was word from senior level sources that Russia had asked the US to stretch an independence process for Kosovo over a longer stretch of time - and tie to it some process of independence for the two autonomous Georgia provinces. In exchange, Russia would not veto the creation of a new state of Kosovo at the security council. The US rejected Russia's secret entreaties and instead rushed recognition of Kosovo and said damn the consequences.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, it could be argued that Russia and Georgia were heading for a clash over South Ossetia, with or without Kosovo independence, as the issue has been simmering for years. </p> <p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian president turned prime minister, in his public statements seemed to put more importance on Georgia's ambitions to join Nato. At its summit in Bucharest this year, <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/issues/nato-georgia/index.html\">Nato agreed that Georgia would become a member</a> of the western military alliance, which would not have gone down well with the Kremlin.</p> <p>What is not in dispute is that Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, overplayed his hand or walked into a Russian trap, but that is almost besides the point. James Sherr, an analyst at the Chatham House thinktank, argues that what the episode shows is Russia's determination to protect its owns interests whatever it takes. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2531270/Georgia-Russia-demands-to-be-regarded-as-number-one.html\">He writes in the Sunday Telegraph.</a></p> <blockquote> <p>... Russia has (in Putin's words) \"earned a right to be self-interested\" and that in its own \"zone\", it will defend these interests irrespective of what others think about them. For Russia, the broader implications are also becoming straightforward. To its political establishment, to the heads of Gazprom and Rosneft, to its armed forces and security services and to their advisors and \"ideologists\", the key point is that the era of western dominance is over.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Politico, Ben Smith looks at how Barack Obama and John McCain, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12409.html\">the two US presidential hopefuls have reacted to the crisis</a>. He notes that Obama took a very mainstream position, calling for negotiations, but that McCain took a much more confrontational stance towards Russia. Smith concludes that McCain's position \"put him more closely in line with the moral clarity and American exceptionalism projected by President Bush's first term\". Of course now in the last days of his presidency, Bush has become much more pragmatic. The \"axis of evil\" rhetoric has been jettisoned and the US is talking to both North Korea and Iran.</p>",
  "<p>Georgia today said it had withdrawn its forces from the breakaway province of South Ossetia as it accused Russia of escalating the conflict by imposing a naval blockade and of preparing to attack Georgian troops in Abkhazia province.</p> <p>The Russian army said Georgian forces were still in South Ossetia. </p> <p>The announcement of a pullout followed three days of fighting in a Georgian push to take control of the pro-Moscow enclave from separatists. Russia reacted with a show of force by sending its troops into South Ossetia and launching air strikes inside Georgia.</p> <p>A Georgian military convoy carrying troops and towing heavy artillery withdrew from South Ossetia through the village of Ergneti, just inside the Georgian-controlled territory south of the separatist capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>\"They have been withdrawn, completely,\" a Georgian interior ministry spokesman, Shota Utiashvili, told Reuters. He said it was \"because of the heavy civilian casualties Georgia has suffered\".</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, visited Ergneti after Tbilisi said it had withdrawn its forces.</p> <p>But the Russian news agency, Interfax, quoted Vladimir Ivanov, an aide to the commander of Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia as saying that Georgian forces, artillery and armour remained. \"Georgia has not withdrawn forces from South Ossetia,\" he said.</p> <p>Amid reports that Georgia was pulling out of South Ossetia, Russian warships arrived at Georgia's Black Sea coast, in an apparent attempt to set up a blockade and prevent Georgia from receiving weapons by sea.</p> <p>Interfax reported that the Moskva missile cruiser and other Russian Black Sea Fleet ships had been deployed to Georgia's coast to prevent any weapons supplies. A Russian navy spokesman refused to comment on the report.</p> <p>Early today, Russia bombed a military airfield outside the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. Georgia said the Russians were also massing troops in Abkhazia on the Black Sea, another rebel region that broke with Tbilisi in the early 1990s after a war.</p> <p>In New York, a top UN peacekeeping official said that there were indications the Abkhaz were preparing to launch a military offensive against Georgian special forces in the upper Kodori gorge in northern Abkhazia.</p> <p>\"At this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond South Ossetia into Abkhazia,\" the UN assistant secretary general for peacekeeping, Edmond Mulet, said.</p> <p>Georgia said Russia last night landed 4,000 troops by sea on the Black Sea coast of Abkhazia, the larger of Georgia's two breakaway regions.</p> <p>Utiashvili said that in the past few hours Russia had brought 6,000 troops into Georgia and a further 4,000 troops by sea. \"All of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions,\" he said.</p> <p>He said Russian planes had bombed Georgia's military airfield, eight miles from Tbilisi, at a plant producing Sukhoi Su-25 ground fighters. No one was hurt, but the impact could be heard in downtown Tbilisi.</p> <p>In a statement, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said he was \"profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the Abkhaz zone\".</p> <p>A Georgian ceasefire offer yesterday was ignored by Moscow, which demanded a complete pullback to positions before fighting began. Shortly before the Georgian ceasefire announcement, shelling could still be heard. An EU-US delegation headed for Georgia to try to broker an end to the conflict.</p> <p>Russia brushed aside criticism of its military offensive. \"Russia's actions in South Ossetia are totally legitimate,\" the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, said, visiting an adjacent region of Russia to which thousands of refugees have fled.</p> <p>Putin said Georgia's desire to join Nato was part of the problem. \"Georgia's aspiration to join Nato ... is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures,\" he said, adding that Georgian action bore \"elements of some kind of genocide against the Ossetians.\"</p> <p>Russian officials said the death toll in fighting that began on Thursday stood at 2,000. Georgia said it had lost up to 300 people, mainly civilians.</p> <p>Many Georgians were shocked by the ferocity of the Russian response. In Gori, where Russian bombs fell yesterday, people voiced hope that the trouble was now over.</p> <p>\"Maybe it will be quiet in the future. I'm an optimist,\" said a 69-year-old woman at a bus stop in the town 16 miles south of the South Ossetian capital.</p> <p>Russia backs South Ossetian separatists and the majority of the population, ethnically distinct from Georgians, have been given Russian passports since the enclave broke with Tbilisi in the early 1990s.</p> <p>Putin said more than 30,000 refugees from South Ossetia had fled over the border in the past 36 hours. Russian officials said two of Moscow's warplanes had been shot down, 13 soldiers killed and 70 wounded.</p> <p>The US president, George Bush, described Russian bombing inside Georgia as a dangerous escalation. The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, told him by phone the only solution was for Georgian troops to quit the conflict zone.</p> <p>Georgia's parliament approved a state of war across the country for the next 15 days, while Russia accused the west of contributing to the violence by supplying Georgia with arms.</p>",

''Does anyone know if she bases her hairstyle on Edward Fox's in The Day Of The Jackal? The parting is slightly higher than his, but the volume and sweep are exactly the same. Sort of like a well conditioned Shredded Wheat.''</p> <p>I think we need some documentary evidence to settle this. Give me 10 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>02.54am: Swimming</strong> - Phelps is up in five minutes or so. He's going for his first gold in the 400m individual medley final.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>02.59am:</strong> Phelps's main competition will come from fellow American, Ryan Lochte. George Bush is in position at the Water Cube. Go on the Hungarian Laszlo Cseh! Seriously. He's good.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>03.04am:</strong> They start with the butterfly. Phelps is half a second under his world record pace. Bald-headed Cseh doesn't need a swimming cap. He's in second. Lochte is close by.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>03:07am:</strong> Cseh and Lochte need to make the move now. Phelps is too strong in the freestyle. A world record is likely.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>03.09am: GOLD for Phelps in the 400m individual medley.</strong> A new world record. Only seven more to go, then ... Cseh takes a surprise silver, and Lochte bronze.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>03.16am:</strong> Just minutes after Phelps's first gold, Rick emails in to gripe and carp and so on: ''In order to truly say Phelps is bettering Mark Spitz's record, shouldn't Phelps regrow his moustache? I mean Spitz was giving the other guys a bit of a chance with his facial fuzz masterpiece, said to have increased his weight by at least 2lbs, so lush and absorbent as it was. That's not to mention the friction factor.''</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>03.18am: Team GB</strong> - Still at the pool: Jemma Lowe equals the British record (57.78sec) to finish fourth in her 100m fly semi-final. She's made the final as 6th fastest, having only just sneaked into that semi.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>03.24am:</strong> Another final at the Cube. Australia's Grant Hackett, having lost out to Thorpe four years ago (no shame there), is up against South Korean sensation Park Tae-Hwa in the men's 400m freestyle. There's a young Beijinger in there, too. He could make history.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>03.29am:</strong> Park's got 10 years over the 28-year-old Hackett. He's watching him all the way. They're level at 200m.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>03.31am: Park wins gold in the 400m freestyle</strong>. The South Korean stretches away at the 200m mark. It looks like he could have gone too early but he sustains the break and the 18-year-old wins it. Zhang Lin from China makes a late burst and gets silver. Bronze goes to the American Larsen Jensen, and Hackett languishes in 5th. George Bush waves his flag again.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>03.37am:</strong> Coda to that 400m. ''Hackett shouldn't feel too bad,'' chirps Billy Paxton. ''He's the husband of Australian singer-songwriter Candice Alley. He has a songwriting credit on her last album and is the only other credited writer besides Alley, so despite this poor result tonight he has the consolation of another career to fall back on.'' Yes, I suppose they can pool their resources. </p> <p>Sorry.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Phelps is on the podium, hand on heart, eyes moistening. Bush looks pretty happy too.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>03.44: Team GB</strong> Two days after her 19th birthday, Hannah Miley is up next in the 400m individual medley final. She's in lane eight. But American Katie Hoff is the favourite.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>03.52am:</strong> Australia's Stephanie Rice makes the strongest start. But the Hoff is still there. This would be an incredible late comeback. 'Smiley Miley', as the typically imaginative British press have dubbed her, is a long way back.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>03.52am: Stephanie Rice wins gold and sets a new world record</strong> (4:29:45). And she lets off a primal scream/woop as she does it. The Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry takes silver and Hoff gets bronze. Miley is in 6th - and it's a poor time, well off her best. 'Smiley Miley' lives up to her (awful) nickname - the British press: the best in the world - by giving a very cheerful interview afterwards. She's still got the 200m to look forward to.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>03.58am: Men's Basketball</strong> - Russia beat Iran 71-49, with the naturalised American JR Holden scoring 19 points. That ain't Olympism, surely.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>04.00am:</strong> Zhang Lin gets a huge cheer on the podium - he's the first Chinese man to win an Olympic medal in the pool. The South Korean anthem then blares out for Park Tae-Hwa.</p> <p><strong>Bush Watch:</strong> Word reaches me across the newsdesk that George Bush stumbled in the stands at the Water Cube. Must have been all that overly vigorous flag-waving. If there's a photo of him on his keester, I'll find it.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>04.08am:</strong> It's raining in Beijing, delaying the start of the tennis. But acid showers don't put off the male volleyball players: China beat Austria 2-0.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>04.14am: Team GB</strong> - Chris Cook finishes 7th in the 100m breaststroke semi-final in 1:00:81. It's one second off his personal best and he doesn't make the final. ''I'm just not on form. That time should have been easy for me to do,'' he says afterwards.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>04.19am: Men's handball</strong> Defending champions Croatia beat Spain 31-29.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>04.23am:</strong> I asked for emails to lift my Olympic spirits. Instead I receive this from Tom Stone, who's obviously under the absurd illusion that human rights are more important than Yngling: ''The Beijing Olympics are a disgrace. Don't watch it, don't blog about it, don't acknowledge it is happening - without at least first thinking about what this the world's greatest sport's event is supposed to represent.''</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>04.26: Brit Watch</strong> - Another final in the pool. Britain's women are in lane eight for the 4x100m freestyle relay, the slowest qualifiers. China were the fastest. You make the prediction.</p> <p>I could be mishearing things. The BBC commentators were questioning whether Stephanie Rice was an underwear model or not. Adrian Moorhouse reckons she would be very good at it: \"She is very fit...\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>04.32am</strong> Britain are in equal fourth, surpassing all expectations at the half way stage.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>04.34am:</strong> But they've fallen away now. The Netherlands take gold. Silver to the US. Bronze to Australia. Great Britain take a second off the domestic record but even that's not enough to catch the four Dutch ladies cavorting in victory at the end of the pool.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>04.42am: Team GB Archery</strong> - a quarter-final against Japan for the women's team of Naomi Folkard, Charlotte Burgess and five-time Olympian Alison Williamson. Britain lead by two.</p> <p>''The hooter for the timing on the archery is clearly the horn off a 1993 Volkswagen Jetta. It's unmistakeable. I'm surprised Eddie Butler didn't pick up on it,'' says Gareth Bennett.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>04.44am:</strong> An email from far, far away! ''Good Morning you poor soul,'' writes Matt, who I warm to immediately since <em>no one else understands me</em>. ''I'm in Seoul spending a Sunday afternoon watching the Korean Olympic coverage on TV. I can't understand the commentary but it appears Park Tae hwan has won 14 gold medals today; either that or they are showing his 400m race on a constant loop. The commentary was hilarious of the final 25 metres: another 50 and I think the commentator would have soiled himself. Oh, and Korean coverage is making me long for the BBC's.''</p> <p>The BBC coverage has been ... Barry Davies-less so far. And that's not a good thing.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>05.02: Team GB</strong> - It's very close in this one. All level with one end to go. Eddie Butler says the word ''sultry'' for the 9th time - it's hot out east, he seems to be stressing - and there goes the car horn again.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>05.10am:</strong> Team GB make the semi finals of the women's archery, seeing off Japan 201 to 188. A 9, 10, 10 in their last set ended the sultry Japanese resistance. They will now face China at 9am-ish BST.</p> <p>Tired of reading my London-based witterings? Read Andy Bull's Beijing-based profundities. He lays down the gauntlet to Michael Phelps <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/phelps_might_truly_be_touched.html\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>05.13am:</strong> What are Asians making of this Chinese Olympics? ''I don't think the Koreans see any problem with China hosting the Olympics or its human rights record or the rampant nationalism on display: the Korean personality is quite similar. I'm convinced they are more concerned with winning more medals than Japan and protesting about USA beef imports,'' says our Korea correspondent, Matt.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>05.22am:</strong> Give just a hint of self-loathing, and the supportive emails positively roll in. ''Don't despair,'' counsels Christian Wolff. ''I'm relying on Guardian updates here in Bangalore, since Indian state TV Doordarshan seems determined to ruin my Olympics experience - despite possessing exclusive national broadcast rights, most of their coverage consists of two elderly gentlemen sitting in a studio re-capping the success of one female badminton player and the failures of the archery team, while completely ignoring any of the LIVE events going on in Beijing...''</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>05.25am:</strong> The gymnastics are in full swing. Tumbles, tinny classical music, impossibly young Chinese girls looking terrified of the consequences of failure... Speaking of the BBC coverage, Victoria Bingham writes: ''Is is just me or do Matt Baker's excitable Geordie mutterings seem wildly out of sync with the grace of the gymnastics. Shouldn't they have him on canoeing or something. He'll be well used to that. That's all they do on Blue Peter, isn't it?''</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>05.30am: Gold for China in the women's 10m air pistol final</strong>. Guo Wenjun takes gold. Russia's Natalia Paderina wins silver with bronze going to Georgia's Nino Salukvadze.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>05.34am: </strong> Andy Bull gets very excited by women's fencing. Read his theatre review <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/olympics_zagunis_the_golden_gi.html\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>05.39am:</strong> A missive from Down Under. ''The Aussie commentators seem a bit disappointed that they didn't win three golds in the pool this morning,'' writes Paul Meek in Brisbane, who immediately emphasises that he's a Kiwi. ''Yesterday was the first time they hadn't won a medal on the first day since 1996 - oh, the humanity! And not sure whether Stephanie Rice has been an underwear model, but she did do a bit of modelling for the local FHM earlier in the year.''</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>05.45am:</strong> ''Despite actually being in an Olympic city (Hong Kong) I am also bizarrely reliant on your commentary to keep me up-to-date,'' writes the magnificently monikered Kester Bramley. ''All the action is on free, terrestrial TV but since my building has no aerial I have what Pink Floyd called \"45 channels of shit on the TV to choose from (choose from)\" but no Olympics. I could go out and watch the equestrian events, I suppose - but trottage, or whatever it is called, on a Sunday? Would rather sit by my screen hoping for a blitz of Gary Naylor insights thanks.''</p> <p>Oh, Naylor, Naylor, wherefore art thou, Naylor? It's dawn in London. We expect him soon.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>05.50:</strong> Fencing and judo are continuing apace. To the Beijing University of Technology for the women's badminton (I almost felt like an anchorman just then), where defending champion Zhang Ning of China has recovered from a shaky start to beat Thailand's Salakjit Ponsana in three sets, 21-23, 21-17, 21-7.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>06.00am: Olympic spirit shames world leaders into stopping all wars for good</strong> - Georgia's Nino Salukvadze took bronze in the 10m air pistol final. After putting down her pistol on her final shot, she wiped tears from her eyes and embraced her Russian opponent, Natalia Paderina. \"I've been really nervous,\" she said afterwards. \"Since yesterday I thought we would leave the Games. The Russian political leaders, our political leaders and other state political leaders should sit and talk about this.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>06.05am:</strong> We've made it past 6am and the reward on the BBC is ... well, i'll let Conor O'Kane explain: ''You sit up all night with Rishi Persad, and what's your reward? Adrian bloody Chiles. That's what the license fee is being used on, flying him to Beijing? As if that's not bad enough, he's forgotten the delightful Christine Bleakley from the One show, so we get Hazel Irvine and her massive teeth.''</p> <p>I think it might be bedtime, Conor.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>06.13am:</strong> By all accounts the tennis has finally got underway. It's been a long rain delay, meaning the Murrays won't be playing their first doubles match for a while yet.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>06.16am: Team GB</strong> In the sailing, the 49er races have started. Steve Morrison and Ben Rhodes have three 30 minute races today. They're currently fourth in the opener. Also in Qingdao, Britain's Yngling crew of Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson are leading from the front.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>06.29am: </strong> Germany beat Angola 95-66 in the men's basketball.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong><strong>06.30am:</strong> Team GB Gymnastics</strong>. Qualification phase - Subdivision 2: GB, Italy, Japan and the US. </p> <p>The shiny-blue-leotarded Great Britain team is warming up for the vault. Remember that Beth Tweddle's hip injury means she will only compete on the asymmetric bars and the floor disciplines.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>06.35am:</strong> Conor O'Kane has had a coffee and comes back for more. He obviously pays attention to his sailing, too. ''One of the 49er class boys in the sailing, Stevie Morrison, hopes his boat's name 'Little Miss Pipe Dream' will prove to be apt. The Dictionary says: 'A pipe dream is a fantastic hope or plan that is generally regarded as being nearly impossible to achieve.' Little Miss Easy Prospect might have been better...''</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>06.40am: Team GB </strong> A good start on the vault for 16-year-old Becky Downie. Her 15.050 is so good it quite literally makes her American opponent cry. </p> <p>In other gymnastics news, the Americans' leotards are awful: garish red, an ugly great big star, the balance is all wrong. The Italians have gone for delightfully classic white with sparkly bits.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>06.52: </strong> Heads up: Former Bluebells bassist Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the China v US basketball game at 2pm BST.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>07.00am: Team GB Cycling</strong> - The women's road race is coming up shortly. Nicola Cooke, Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws will take 3 and a half hours to complete the 72km route.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong><strong>07.03am:</strong> Team GB</strong> Ben Rhodes and Stevie Morrison made a solid start in their first 49er class race, finishing fourth in Qingdao.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>07.06am: There's no accounting for taste.</strong> Sean Dickinson emails from Shanghai to dispute my gymnastics analysis: ''Just wanted to wake you up if you weren't already asleep which, judging by your presumably worsening eyesight and taste, is evidenced by your lack of appreciation for yellow stars on skimpy red leotards.''</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>07.11am: Team GB Cycling</strong> The women's road race is go!</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>07.14am: Gymnastics</strong> Rebecca Wing opens on the beam for GB. I'm told it was good. </p> <p>Sean Dickinson is pining for the green fields of Hollyoaks: ''Go Tweddle! She's from my hometown of Chester, and what she did looked impressive to me.''</p> <p>Beth Tweddle's score of 15.65 puts her fourth in the bars - the top eight go through. She hit the bar with one of her feet during her routine, costing her points.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>07.17am: Team GB Yngling</strong> <strong>Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson are first in the overall standings</strong> after placing fourth in their third race. Holland and Finland follow close behind.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>07.23am:</strong> In the men's Judo (66kg), a showdown between a Russian and a Georgian has been narrowly averted. Miklos Ungvari of Hungary beat the Georgian Zaza Kedelashvili to set up a quarter-final with Russia's Alim Gadanov. The two countries will just have to settle their differences on the battlefield.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>07.30am: Road race</strong> 110.6km to go. The riders are all bunching together. No one's yet made the break. Speaking of breaks, I'm off in 30 minutes. Must...keep...typing....But never fear: Alan Gardner will see you through to the end with a laughably easy three-hour shift.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong><strong>07.34am:</strong> Team GB</strong> News of Ben Ainslie in today's Finn event. He's finished fourth place in race three, which puts him second overall.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>07.38am: Team GB Gymnastics </strong> Sixteen-year-old Hannah Whelan does a jig or two in her floor routine. Folkish violins accompany her smiles and wiggles. Then she attempts some real gymnastics. Oh dear. A stumble. Then a pike. Not bad.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong><strong>07.46am:</strong> Team GB Sailing</strong> Ben Rhodes and Stevie Morrison finish third in the second 49er race. That puts them second overall. One more race to come today.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>07.55am: Team GB Gymnastics</strong> Beth Tweddle's floor routine begins. She needs it to go well. </p> <p>It's decent - 14.950 - but she is unlikely to make the final. Overall, Britain lie fifth after four rotations. Team qualification in the top eight will be struggle. Becky Downie is hovering close to individual qualification but there a lot of women to come.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>08.13am:</strong> Hello all. Taimour has headed off to stare blankly into space somewhere, and I'll be your Olympic guide for the next few hours. News on Beth Tweddle, and the GB women road racers asap...</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.20am: Team GB rowing</strong> Wellity, well, we have a real medal hope to discuss, ladies and gentleman. Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter are going in the mens lightweight double sculls, and they've apparently set their hearts on gold. The pair have started smoothly and are holding a comfortable advantage, with two to go through.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.27am: Team GB rowing</strong> Purchase and Hunter are safely through into the semi-final, winning by a length and only 3.7sec outside the world record. Good start for the boat boys.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.35am: China have picked up another gold</strong>, in the women's synchronised 3m springboard. Guo Jingjing and Wu Minxia, the reigning world and Olympic champions have wrapped things up again. Russia took silver, with Germany collecting bronze.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>8.45am: We got mail.</strong> And yes, it's the first of the day from Gary Naylor. \"I note from your 7.00am update,\" notes Naylor, \"that 'Nicola Cooke, Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws will take 3 and a half hours to complete the 72km route.' Unless all the competitors are stopping for a pleasant Sunday afternoon picnic with a glass or two of Pimms, I suspect that an average speed of 20km per hour won't secure a medal.\" Well, you know how the British like to do things Gary.</p> <p>In fact, after some <a href=\"http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/cyclingroad/n214522963.shtml\">rummaging</a>, I can scribble in my official correction highlighter that the women will not be cycling a mere 72km... it'll be more like double that, once they've got up into the mountains (where it's pouring, apparently), and done a wee jaunt along the Great Wall. They're not there yet, though.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8.54am: Team GB</strong> Cooke, Pooley and Laws are safely ensconced in the peloton... although they may as well be in the pool, the amount of rain that's washing around their wheels as they head out of Beijing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Billy Joe Saunders</strong> has given his opponent, Turkey's Adem Kilicci, an absolute tonking in the welterweight class. He won 14-3, and will fight again next Sunday.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>8.59am: News from Beijing.</strong> Apparently, such is their hatred for the west*, the Chinese equivalents of Adrian Chiles and Hazel Irvine have started mocking our athletes' weight. \"Watching here in Beijing on TV, my flatmate just informed me that the Chinese commentators amusingly said the British women couldn't succeed in diving because they were too fat,\" emails Nicky Goh. \"To qualify it slightly, they did go on to say that with their weight, it was extremely unlikely they could achieve the necessary body strength to allow for the turning power necessary.\" Oh, that's all right then.</p> <p>*Of course, we know they don't hate us really</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>9.04am: Team GB archery</strong> Eddie Butler's mellifluous tones are telling me about the women archers, who are up against the Chinese. Win, and they're guaranteed a medal; lose, and they'll have to duke it out for bronze. Currently, it's in the balance.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>9.08am: Team GB rowing</strong> Some more success in the mens lightweight four, where Chambers, Clarke, Lindsay-Fynn and Mattick are through in their heat, coming home behind China.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>9.15am: Team GB archery</strong> At the halfway stage, the British girls trail by just two points, but they need to keep hitting the bullseye to make up ground on their opponents. Interestingly, the announcer in the archery arena appears to be American.</p> <p>Oh, and on that subject, it's the clash of civilisations, sorry, China v USA in the basketball later today, and Lawrence Donegan will be <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/china_v_usa_usa_usa_live.html\">blogging about it LIVE</a>. It doesn't start till 3pm, though, so stick with me until then.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>9.23am: Team GB archery</strong> China will take on the winners of Korea v France for the women's team gold medal. The Brits can still take bronze though, and it's no shame losing to the Chinese, who've won every gold in female arrers since the 1984 Olympics.</p> <p>In the <strong>cycling, the women's team are well positioned out in a very wet road race.</strong> Pooley is right up at the front, and all three managed to avoid a nasty crash that happened a short while ago.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9.32am: Team GB</strong> Ben Ainslie is second in the overall standings in the Finn, having won the fourth race ahead of Zach Railey of the USA. Railey currently heads the field, with a score of 11, but Ainslie is just five points behind on 16 (the lower the better).</p> <p>In the rowing, it's the women's heavyweight quadruple sculls, where China are out in front, with one spot in the final up for grabs. In fact, they're <em>miles</em> out in front...</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.35am: Team GB rowing</strong> Britain's women's heavyweight four, who are the reigning world champions, will go next against the Germans, with both expected to be China's main oppo in next Sunday's final.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.39am: Correction corner.</strong> My hideous ignorance of the archery has been revealed. \"I think you'll find it is the South Koreans, not the Chinese, who have won all those women's archery gold medals,\" says Philip Reynolds, all the way from Wellington, NZ. \"And it's not called the bullseye; it's called the gold or (in Olympic archery) the ten.\" I was employing the vernacular, Phil.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.43am: Team GB rowing</strong> The women's quadruple scullers are moving well out on the water, putting some deep blue between them and the German team.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.45am:</strong> GB being reeled in by Germany, can Grainger and her crew hold on...? Less than 500m to go.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>9.48am: Team GB rowing</strong> There was enough left in the tank and the ladies will take their place in the final. They'll be up, as ever, against the Chinese. You can get some background on Katherine Grainger and the GB quad <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympicsrowing.britisholympicteam\">here</a>. Sir Steve (Redgrave) reckons they did pretty well out there.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>9.52am: Cycling</strong> There's a Russian out in front in the road race, and she's putting some pressure on the field. The <strong>British trio are still well in contention for a medal</strong>, though. They've been cycling for nearly three hours now.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>9.55am: Team GB rowing</strong> In the lightweight men's quadruple sculls the chaps have pulled hard and qualified in second. I imagine they'll all be off for an erg now, to celebrate.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10.00am: Team GB cycling</strong> Emma Pooley has made a break on the climb, and she's in a group tailing the Russian, Boyarskaya. Cooke is back in fourth with a strong finish up her sleeve. Hopefully.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>10.05am:</strong> It seems the media centre in Beijing is falling apart. At least the BBC's studio is. A violent squall has halted the women's archery bronze play-off - where we could be looking at a <strong>first medal for Team GB</strong> - and the women's cycling road race is similarly pluvial. But the real drama, as I say, is at BBC hq, where someone has joined Hazel Irvine in the studio holding a bucket. They're crouched discretely behind the sofa... but I can definitely see them holding the bucket.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10.12am:</strong> Nigeria are playing Japan in the football. I'm backing the Super Eagles there. Hopefully we're going to get a GB medal before long, with real prospects in the cycling and the archery. I'd be reet chuffed to break such news, I can tell you.</p> <p>A Chinese rider has slid into the storm drain in the women's road race. Plenty of names still in the mix... <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/longo_joins_elite_group_of_sev.html\">Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli, the oldest lady in the field</a> has just had a go at the front!</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10.19am:</strong> The cyclists have just reached the highest point along the Badaling Great Wall, and with twelve kilometres to go Tatiana Guderzo of Italy is leading.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>10.27am: Medal news.</strong> While we wait for Britain to get on the medal table, Thailand have snapped up their first gold. The improbably named Prapawadee Jaroenrattanatarakoon (or Charoenrattanatharakul if you want to go with the Guardian's Olympic guide) has bossed the field in women's 53kg weightlifting. Apparently she used to be known as Junpim Kantatian, which is altogether less of a mouthfull. Yun Jin-hee of South Korea took silver and Anastassia Novikava of Belarus bronze.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the rowing has been suspended for the day due to the weather.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>10.31am:</strong> 1km to go in the women's road race. Nicole Cooke, fifth in Athens, appears to have lost contact... but apparently she's recovered.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>10.33am: Team GB</strong> Cooke leading with 100m to go.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>10.34am: Team GB GOLD!</strong> Nicole Cooke has claimed the first British medal of Beijing 2008. Some confusion on the broadcast for a moment there, with the Italian Guderzo's name flashing up on screen as the winner... But Cooke is jubilant!</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>10.38am:</strong> Cooke, swathed in one of those plastic ponchos you get at festivals, is enjoying this. Several vigorous fist pumps, and the Welshwoman couldn't care a jot about the rain now.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>10.42am:</strong> A big hand should go to Emma Pooley, who finished 23rd, for her earlier efforts in chasing down the leader on the climb. Cooke really seemed to benefit from her team-mates' support, something she lacked four years ago. That's the 200th gold medal at Olympic Games for Great Britain.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>10.45am: Team GB archery</strong> The BBC's rainfall woes in the studio appeared to have been dealt with... and we're off to the Bronze medal match in the women's team archery.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>10.49am:</strong> The clouds are lowering above the archers, as Britain complete their first end (of four) with a score of 48. The French are just behind on 46.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>10.52am:</strong> The American guy on the mic is doing a neat job, as the second end gets under way. He might well be Chinese, of course, with a nifty Yankee drawl, but hey...</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>10.55am:</strong> And after the second end, it's all square, 97 each.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>10.56am:</strong> Hold on... one of the French arrows has been remarked, and they're ahead.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.01am:</strong> Good start to the third end, with a full ten for GB, but it's still tight as we head towards 18 completed arrows. Six more will decide where this bronze is going. GB: 149 plays France: 150.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.03am:</strong> \"Isn't archery just darts for posh people?\" wondered Gary Naylor some time ago. Three arrows left and France look like they're going to sneak it... three points the advantage.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.06am:</strong> Nine, 10, eight for GB. France need 25 points to win from three...</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>11.08am: France win the bronze medal.</strong> Gah! No success in the women's team archery, then. Two points the margin of victory, and the GB arrer-wielders obviously weren't posh enough. \"No - darts for posh people is d'arts,\" counters Philip Reynolds. Touch\u00e9, Naylor?</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>11.12am: Medal ceremony.</strong> Nicole Cooke \"conquered the course and tamed the opposition\", apparently. In fact, she beat them in a bike race. And she's being awarded a gold for her troubles now. Sing with me: \"God save our gracious Queen...\"</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>11.18am:</strong> Nigeria have knocked one in against the Japanese to take a 1-0 lead in the football. Sharp side-foot finish in the box by Obinna Nsofor. And Everton's Victor Anichebe has taken the field.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>11.22am: The Cooke report.</strong> So, we've picked up our first necklace of the Games, and it's a shiny gold one to boot. Read about Nicole Cooke's success in the women's road race <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympics.cyclingroadrace\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>11.31am:</strong> The indomitable Koreans have opened up a lead against the Chinese in the women's team archery final. Meanwhile, the Croatian water polo team reckon the moustaches they have grown for the Olympics will help them go all the way. \"It's for good luck, but we can't talk about it, it's a secret, if I tell you, it will ruin it,\" Igor Hinic told Reuters, ruining his precious secret in one flap of the tongue.</p> <p>Maybe they're right, though. It worked for Mark Spitz, after all. In fact, it's Spitz Day here at Rebranded Website, and we're all sporting handle bars.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>11.35am: South Korea win gold in the women's team archery</strong>, setting a new world record in the process. China will have to settle for silver.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>11.42am:</strong> Dave Godman, meanwhile, has trawled his way right down to the 5.22am entry to concur with Christian Wolff's struggles to comprehend Indian television's coverage of the Games.</p> <p>\"You only watch the Olympics on the state channel here [India] if you have a finely tuned appreciation of surreal farce,\" says Dave, avoiding the opportunity to stick a knee in the ribs of the BBC's (excellent) coverage. \"Eight years ago I watched in a hotel room. Random live visual feeds were appearing on the screen, with no sound commentary. It was left to the two talking heads in the studio to figure out what was going on. At one point a handball game manifested, but neither of the commentators had ever seen a handball game before.\" Them and me both, to be honest.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>11.47am:</strong> Nigeria are 2-1 ahead now. No Joseph Yobo there, of course, because the Nigerian FA forgot to include him in their squad. Much to the delight of Everton fans, presumably.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>11.53am:</strong> Turns out Victor Anichebe scored Nigeria's second, ultimately the winner. Will England regret not calling him up when they still could? It's not like the national set-up is exactly overflowing with confident strikers...</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>11.59am: Team GB swimming</strong> Gemma Spofforth and Elizabeth Simmonds have made the semi-finals of the women's 100m backstroke, after finishing 3rd and 4th in their heats respectively.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.05pm: Cricket corner.</strong> Steve Harmison has knocked over a couple of wickets in the Test. You can follow the action with Carrie Dunn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/englandsouthafrica.overbyover\">here</a>.</p> <p>Lots of stroking going on at the Water Cube, meanwhile.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.10pm: Medal news.</strong> China have another gold, this time <strong>in the women's judo 52kg weight category.</strong> Xian Dongmei beat An Kum Ae of North Korea to retain the title she won in Athens. The crowd quite enjoyed that.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.19pm: Team GB swimming</strong> Robbie Renwick from Aberdeen is racing in the men's 200m freestyle. He appears to be in second...</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.21pm:</strong> Renwick came home in third, and is in with a shout of making the semis. The Baltimore Bullet (surely a more nautical nickname would work better?) Michael Phelps has just flopped into the pool for a lazy 200m of his own. Britain's Ross Davenport is also racing.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.27pm:</strong> Phelps, sans tache, finishes in second, but is surely saving himself for the crunch. Davenport was sixth.</p> <p>Turns out no one else on the desk has gone with the spirit of Mark Spitz Day, and I'm the only one who turned up with a stylish facial accoutrement. Bah.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.35pm: Medal news. Japan have taken gold in the men's 66kg judo</strong>, Masato Uchishiba triumphing against Benjamin Darbelet of France.</p> <p><strong>Team GB swimming</strong> Despite his third place, Robbie Renwick's slower heat has meant he will not be in the semis, his time just a hundredth of a second short. Davenport, who was in Phelps' heat, is through though.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.38pm: Team GB badminton</strong> Tracey Hallam is thwacking a shuttlecock back and forth against Kristina Ludikova of the Czech Republic in the women's singles round of 32.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.42pm: Team GB swimming</strong> Kate Haywood and Kirsty Balfour are off in the women's 100m breaststroke...</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.44pm:</strong> Haywood finished third, Balfour fourth, and they're both potential semi-finalists.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>12.47pm:</strong> They're both through, with the 11th and 14th best times respectively. The Australian Leisel Jones broke the Olympic record in that final heat, so she's the fish to catch. Haywood and Balfour will need to get to the final before I'm going to be lured into medal talk, though.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>12.55pm:</strong> In the Olympic football, we've got Netherlands versus the US, and Jacqui Oatley on the mic. Real Madrid's Roysten Drenthe hammers a left foot volley over the bar for the Dutch, as Aston Villa newbie Brad Guzan practises semaphore.</p> <p>Earlier, Ronaldinho scored twice in Brazil's 5-0 larruping of New Zealand. Argentina nicked it 1-0 against Australia, while Cameroon beat Honduras 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>1.02pm: Team GB swimming</strong> Liam Tancock, the British hope in the 100m backstroke comes home third in his heat after torpedoing off the platform. He'll be back in the semis later.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Tancock goes out quick, that's what he does. He's pleased, as is Gregor Tait who's also in the semi-finals.</p> <p>And you'll be smiling when you've cast your mince pies over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/10/olympics2008?picture=336400711\">these photos from today</a>.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.10pm: GOAL! USA 0-1 Holland</strong> Ryan Babel finishes from close range after some confusion in the box. Liverpool's wingman gets his first goal of the tournament.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.14pm: Team GB boxing</strong> Bradley Saunders has stopped his Ghanaian opponent Samuel Kotey Neequaye in the first round of their light welterweight match-up. Biff boff.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.18pm:</strong> Just getting a replay of that Saunders fight, and he really crunched the little fella with a body shot. Layed him flatter than a new patio.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.31pm:</strong> The geriatric form of Brian McBride is trundling around the more deserted parts of the pictch, ie. the Dutch half. How old is he? Answers in an email.</p> <p>Meanwhile, shattering news for all male Olympic-watchers: <strong> Anna Ivanovic has PULLED OUT</strong>. \"This is one of the worst moments of my career,\" she said. And I can only echo that statement.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.34pm:</strong> Half time score update:</p> <p>Serbia 1-2 Ivory Coast<br>USA 0-1 Netherlands<br>Belgium 1-0 China<br>Italy 2-0 South Korea</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>1.38pm: Team GB swimming</strong> In the women's 400m freestyle, Jo Jackson has just finished second to Katie Hoff, the US bellwether in the pool, in a time that is just under a tenth of a second outside Hoff's <strong>new Olympic record.</strong></p> <p>Rebecca Adlington, who is being tipped as a British gold medal prospect, goes in the next heat.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.44pm:</strong> Adlington pushes the current world record holder Federica Pellegrini all the way in their heat, the Brit finishing second with the second-quickest time overall.</p> <p>Pellegrini also <strong>broke the Olympic record just set by Hoff</strong>, as it goes.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.50pm: Team GB badminton</strong> Gail Emms and Donna Kellogg are playing their Chinese opposition in the women's doubles. Earlier, Tracey Hallam progressed in her singles match, with a 21-18, 21-13 victory.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.53pm:</strong> The US men's 4x100m freestyle relay team has just set a new record over in the Water Cube. And Michael Phelps wasn't even near the pool. Apparently they're the US B-team. It's those Speedos, I tell you, should be banned...</p> <p>Great Britain are about to go in the second heat.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.58pm: Team GB swimming</strong> The British lads have gunned their way through that heat, finishing in fourth and sealing a spot in the final. They <strong>smashed the British record by five seconds</strong>, in the process.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>2.01pm: China have hoovered up another gold, this time in the men's 56kg weightlifting.</strong> Long Quinquan won from Anh Tuang Hoang of Vietnam and Indonesia's Eko Yuli Irawan.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2.06pm: GOAL! USA 1-1 Netherlands</strong> Sacha Kljestan hammers a strike through the Dutch stopper after Freddy Adu's clever reverse pass. Yes, that Freddy Adu.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>2.12pm: Team GB hockey</strong> The girls from Blighty are taking on the Germans as I type, with the scores currently tied nil all. Someone has just been shown a green card - which means little to me, but is \"akin to a professional foul\" apparently. The best news though is that the legendary Barry Davies is providing the verbal annotation.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.17pm: GOAL! USA 2-1 Netherlands</strong> Jozy Altidore, newly-signed by Villarreal, has put the septics in front. Meanwhile, according to Sean Dickinson in Shanghai, someone in the China-Belgium game has been \"sent off for what appeared to be hitting someone [else] off the ball when the ref's head was turned\". If that's clear.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.25pm: Team GB hockey - GOAL! Germany 1-0 Great Britain</strong> \"Beautifully done,\" exclaims Barry Davies, as the GB ladies turn their opponents inside then out. Moments later Germany take the lead from a penalty corner.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.30pm: GOAL! Germany 1-1 Great Britain</strong> Back in the game. A penalty corner at the other end and the ball squirts into the goal off the wet surface.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.33pm: GOAL! Germany 2-1 Great Britain</strong> Ach, as soon as they're level there's a loss of concentration at the back by Britain and the red-clad Germans have the lead again.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.35pm: Olympic football - GOAL! USA 2-2 Netherlands</strong> The 34-year-old Gerald Sibon, who once played for Sheffield Wednesday, drills a free-kick under the wall and past Brad Guzan. That will certainly change the state of Group B - although I'm not entirely certain in what way.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.46pm:</strong> Final scores in the football for you:</p> <p>Serbia 2-4 Ivory Coast<br>USA 2-2 Netherlands<br>Belgium 2-0 China<br>Italy 3-0 South Korea</p> <p>It appears the hosts ended up with just nine men on the pitch in their loss to Belgium. Seems like the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200407/16/eng20040716_149849.html\">inventors of football</a> are as adept at rolling over as we are.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>2.50pm: Team GB badminton</strong> After that flurry of GOALs I forgot to inform you that Emms and Kellogg were defeated in their first round doubles match against China's Zhang Jiewen and Wei Yili, losing 21-19 21-13.</p> <p>Still 2-1 to Germany in the hockey.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.55pm: Pat on the back dept.</strong> As this mbm prepares to roll up its bumper Olympic guide and head into the Beijing sunset, David Lloyd's email lands:</p> <p>\"I've been living in north China for around 18 months now, generally having a great time in an amazing country. So I've obviously been looking forward to these Olympics for a long time as you might imagine. To date however it's not been the best of starts. I was up at 5.30am to witness the torch relay but couldn't get within 30 metres of the road barrier, then the typhoon in South China kept me and my mate stranded just long enough to miss the football match in Tinajin last Wednesday night, for which I had tickets. Now to cap it all, I find that of the endless CCTV channels showing Olympic coverage, including the specially set up one, none have any spoken or written English language coverage. Considering all the effort the Chinese have put into these games, that's a big oversight if you ask me, especially when considering the tens of thousands of English speakers who've travelled here specially, not to mention the good ol' expat community.\"</p> <p>Glad to have been of service, David. We'll be here all fortnight.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>3.01pm: Team GB hockey - GOAL! Germany 3-1 Great Britain</strong> Looks like a wrap there then.</p> <p>With day two drawing to a close, I shall bid you all goodbye. If you fancy following the almighty ding-dong that's bound to ensue between China and the US in the basketball, slam-dunk you way across <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/china_v_usa_usa_usa_live.html\">to Lawrence Donegan's blog</a> now. And if diving and histrionics are more your thing, why not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/10/portsmouth.manchesterunited\">join Paul Doyle for the FA Community Shield</a>. That's it from me, cheerio.</p>"
