  "<p>If you were to choose a county to get caught trying to enter illegally, then I'd like to think you could do a lot worse than Britain. In Saudi Arabia, for example, you would be beheaded, immediately and publicly, right in the middle of the arrivals terminal. In China, it's a bullet to the back of the head. And if you try to get into the US overland, you're likely to be met not by the authorities but by a vigilante gun-toting redneck who will tie you by your ankles to the back of his pick-up truck and drag you back home again. To Canada. </p> <p>Here, though, I hope you would get treated with decency and courtesy. The people in<strong> UK Border Force</strong> (Sky1), which follows our UK Border Agency around at work, come out of it reasonably. I like the lady at Heathrow passport control, who politely asks a man to take his cap off so she can see if he's the person in his passport (he is, and he's also Michael Caine). And when an Indian man says he'll kill himself if they send him back to India, they take his threat seriously. The poor man - he says he's here for a five-day tour with his wife. So why have they got 18,000 cigarettes and 27 kilos of rolling tobacco in their luggage? I think maybe they're just heavy smokers, especially while on tour, but the customs people aren't buying 1,800 a day habits (plus a few thousand rollies), and they're sent - politely - back. </p> <p>They do know the cameras are on them, of course, so they're probably on best behaviour. And there's still room for improvement. \"You've got a lot of Afghans, Iranis, Iraqis ... \" says a British official at Calais, who's trying to stop \"clandestines\" crossing the channel. Iranis? Where are they from? Any Pakistanians? </p> <p>And a cheerful lady called Bridget, whose job it is to stick her CO2 probe into trucks to see if anyone's been breathing in them, says: \"We've got one here, guys,\" as if she'd caught a fish. And she goes on: \"We've got a young male Eritrean that's in here.\" Who's in here, or just \"in here\", would have been nicer, given that the young male Eritrean (Eritrani?) turns out to be a person. I know it's only language, but language does reflect attitude. Funny, really, that the British immigration people are let down by their poor command of English. </p> <p>\"He's fine,\" says Bridget, cheerfully, still sounding as if she's talking about an animal. \"He's distressed at the moment. He's only upset cos we've found him, that's all.\" Maybe Bridget's CO2 probe also has psychic powers, and tells her what her prisoners are thinking, and how they're feeling. </p> <p>Actually, I'd like to have known a bit about the young Eritrean - if not what he was thinking and feeling, then something of his story, maybe even his name. I know this wasn't the point of the film - which was celebrating Britain's Border and Immigration Agency, a human levee heroically holding back the flood waters of Hurricane Foreign Invasion. But I couldn't help thinking the people trying to get in might be more interesting than the people trying to keep them out. Typical bleedin'-heart bloody Guardian ...</p> <p><strong>Prison Break</strong> (Sky1), now in series four, has moved a long way from the original premise. It had to, I suppose - you can't go on breaking out of jail, or even breaking into jail - forever. So now Michael and Lincoln and the gang are breaking into lots of different places, in order to steal the data cards that will bring down The Company.</p> <p>I think. It's thoroughly confusing; what normally happens is that just when I've figured out who someone is, they get killed. I mean ghosted; it's important to use the right language when talking about Prison Break. My favourite line comes from Roland the hacker. \"Only if you don't got me, hombre,\" he says. Get that man a job at British Immigration. Lord knows what he's on about, or what any of it's about. But it's still ridiculously exciting - fabulous fun. </p> <p>I didn't see much of <strong>The Sex Education Show</strong> (Channel 4). Don't need it - I know it all, obviously. But I did like the girl who told us when she \"first lost my virginity\". Another candidate for Immigration, perhaps? </p> <p>I'm afraid I didn't see <strong>Who Really Killed Jesus? </strong>(Five). Was it Colonel Mustard, in the library, with the lead piping?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday September 13 2008. The UK border force is called the UK Border Agency, not the Border and Immigration Agency as we said above. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<h2>Life of your drive</h2> <p>Oxford Brookes University is setting up what it calls \"a sustainable vehicle centre\", which it says will deal with \"the current and future challenges facing the whole lifecycle of motor vehicles ... and its impact on the environment\". Hmm. Eco Soundings wonders whether it will be opened by Jeremy Clarkson, who was awarded an honorary degree by Oxford Brookes in 2005 for services rendered to the auto industry, and whose love of the environment is legendary. Clarkson's TV show, Top Gear, has just been rapped by the BBC standards committee for showing the great man drinking while driving at the wheel on the way to the magnetic North Pole. The show's producers defended the footage, saying: \"They weren't shown to be not in control of the car.\" </p> <h2>Panel beating</h2> <p>What exactly was the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) doing when it came out last week with a study alleging that \"payback\" periods for solar thermal and solar photovoltaic (PV) could take 100 years or more. \"Misleading, inaccurate, and out of date,\" screamed PV company Solarcentury, which was backed by Sharp, the Japanese firm that has a large PV factory in Wrexham, north Wales, and is run off its feet making panels for the world. \"RICS' conclusions are a mixture of historic pricing information and the very crudest 'payback' calculations which bear no resemblance to reality,\" says Jeremy Leggett, executive chair of Solarcentury. Minimal research by Eco Soundings suggests that solar installers are offering retrofit PV systems with a \"payback\" of 13 years. </p> <h2>Hailing distance</h2> <p>An email comes from Kenya: \"For the first time in our history, a hailstorm hit an area around the Aberdare Range, near Nyahururu town, yesterday, leaving 10 inches thick of ice spread over an area of 200 hectares. The villagers were left in shock. We need to arm ourselves in advance. Send over winter clothes urgently. My heart got heavy to see a cow walking on snow with a lot of difficulties. This ogre we have labelled climate change is a real agony!!!\"</p> <h2>Making waives</h2> <p>National and international environment groups have sided with EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson and the UK government over the toxic French aircraft carrier Clemenceau, which is due to arrive on Teesside to be scrapped, with 700 tonnes of asbestos aboard. The people of Hartlepool say the town is in danger of becoming the toxic capital of Europe, with local company Able UK specialising in scrapping \"dirty\" ships. The feisty Friends of Hartlepool group has signed up environmental law firm Public Interest Lawyers to challenge the government's Health and Safety Executive for waiving the asbestos importing rules to allow the Clemenceau in. The case will hinge on how much the executive took into account French union protestations that there are firms in France eager and able to scrap the ship that India and other developing countries said was too toxic for them.</p>",
  "<p>The immigration proposals outlined by Frank Field and Nicholas Soames (Labour MPs immigration plan brings claims of xenophobia, September 8), if implemented, would place an unacceptably high burden on UK firms and damage our economy. There are several problems. First, forcing employers to advertise jobs across Europe, as well as locally, would cost companies considerable amounts of time and money. Second, they cannot assume businesses will be happy to take on more policing duties of their new system because again, this would add to their already considerable regulatory burden. Third, setting a strict limit on the number of people allowed to settle permanently in the UK after their initial work permit expires will simply put off many talented workers from choosing this country in the first place. Immigration adds billions to our economy every year and quotas are not the answer for a country looking to compete in a global market for talent.<strong><br>Colin Stanbridge</strong><br>Chief executive, London Chamber of Commerce and Industry </p> <p>The all-party balanced migration group's report argues that Britain may need to build \"seven new Birminghams\" to accommodate new migrants. Yet Birmingham has benefited massively from migration. Fuelling hysteria over migration simply won't address the challenges we face as cities like Birmingham and Leicester become ever-more diverse. The group's central tenet - that non-EU migrants should have to return home after four years of residency in the UK - ignores numerous push-and-pull factors involved in a migrant's decision on whether to stay in the UK. It also fails to acknowledge the positive financial and cultural impact such migrants have on Britain.<br><strong>Sukhvinder Kaur-Stubbs</strong><br>Chief executive, Barrow Cadbury Trust </p> <p>Immigration policy has long been in need of reform and the present rate is clearly unsustainable. Many citizens - even leftwingers - wish to see much less of it to our already crowded isle. The negatives are clear: we don't have the housing, there are clear strains on public services, the low paid are squeezed etc. It is crucial to put the resources needed into upgrading the educational and life skills of the large minority of our young people whose lives are defined by hopelessness. It is also crucial to put the resources needed into retraining older people. </p> <p>In future the government needs to use EU transition rules over the permitted seven years to stop a repeat of the huge numbers of migrants from accession countries which we saw in 2004. These people are not refugees and their skills are needed by their own countries. I would suggest aiming not for balancing the ins and outs, but substantially reducing inward immigration. <br><strong>Freya Coxley</strong><br>Falmouth, Cornwall</p>",
  "<p><strong>\"I have just read <a href=\"http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/3551669.Avenue__hat_trick_hero__didn_t_even_play/\">this story </a>on the Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus site,\"</strong> wrote Luke Thorne a few weeks ago. <strong>\"Are there any other examples of clubs so blatantly lying to their fans? Has any side just invented results or made-up heroic performances?\"</strong><br> Sean DeLoughry writes in to tell us about St Patrick's Athletic, who aren't so much lying to their fans as lying to themselves. The 2001-02 season was an eventful one for Athletic. It began when they were deducted nine points for fielding Paul Marney, who, thanks to some paperwork errors, was inellegible, in the first three games of the campaign. An appeal against the penalty was later successful.</p> <p>St Pat's, though, failed to learn their lesson and, when just two points behind the leaders Shelbourne with two games in hand, were docked 15 points in March 2002 for failing to properly register Ugandan international Charles Mbabazi Livingstone for the first five games of the season. St Pat's claimed that it was a mere clerical error and that they had gained nothing by it, but the league stood firm \u2013 their decision was final. At the end of the season, the club finished 10 points behind Shelbourne \u2013 without the deduction they would have won the title. But \u2026</p> <p>\"St Pats declined to accept the decision, and awarded themselves a trophy,\" writes Sean. \"Pats' programme and <a href=\"http://www.stpatsfc.com/honours.php\">website</a> still claim their phantom league title, though the <a href=\"http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=101&amp;Itemid=104\">Football Association of Ireland</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ier02.html\">everyone else</a> seem to think otherwise.\"</p> <p><strong>DITCHING THE GLOVES</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Has a club ever signed a goalkeeper, only to then move him to an outfield position (on a full-time basis), or vice-versa,\"</strong> asked Robert O'Shea last week.</p> <p>They have indeed, Robert, more often than you might expect. One name that stands out in our inbox this week is that of <a href=\"http://blogs.chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/12/campos.jpg\">shy</a>, <a href=\"http://valechumbar.com/files/previous/nucleus/20050801-as_JorgeCampos_lg.jpg\">retiring</a> Mexican stopper Jorge Campos. </p> <p>\"Campos was signed in 1989 by Pumas UMAM as a goalkeeper,\" writes Paul Haynes, \"but because Adolfo Rios was playing well in goal, Campos was used as a striker, scoring 14 goals in his first full season. Campos, who <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Jorge_Campos.jpg\">often wore the No9 shirt for his club</a>, went on to win 130 caps for Mexico, but all of these as a goalkeeper.\" Thanks to Nigel Cundale for the same idea.</p> <p>Simon Abbott suggests Lucas Radebe, but though the South African did start out as a goalkeeper, by the time he moved from Kaizer Chiefs to Leeds he had been converted into a midfielder. At Elland Road Howard Wilkinson moved him to centre-half.</p> <p>From Mexico and South Africa, to the less exotic climes of Luton and Exeter. \"I'm not sure what position he was playing when Luton Town signed him, but Tony Read was Luton's regular keeper in the 1967/68 promotion season,\" writes Keith Hayward. \"But in his career of 203 appearances he scored 12 goals while playing as what we would now call a striker, including (I believe) a hat-trick.\"</p> <p>Tom Lippiett offers Matt Taylor of Exeter City, though by the sounds of it Team Bath should take the credit for converting the player from a No1 to a No5. \"Matt was instrumental in getting Exeter City back into the Football League this May, and won City's player of the season award,\" writes Tom. \"However, just two years before joining Exeter, Matt was playing as a goalkeeper for Burscough, which included him goalkeeping in (and winning) the FA Trophy final in 2003. Matt moved to Team Bath in 2006, where he converted to a (full-time) centre-back. Former Burscough team-mate Lee McEvilly noted his surprise when he lined up against the now outfield Taylor in the Exeter v Cambridge matches last year, which included the play-off final.\"</p> <p><strong>HEARTWARMING FOOTBALLING PHILANTHROPY</strong></p> <p><strong>\"I've read all about greedy footballers for years, but then overheard a story in a pub that gave me back my faith in mankind, or at least football players,\"</strong> begins David Duchin. <strong>\"Unfortunately, I was a bit tipsy and sort of missed the beginning, most of the middle and end of the story. To make an abbreviated story even shorter, an Italian footballer was badly injured in pre-season and missed the rest of the season. This was the last season on his contract and when it came to negotations, he offered to play for the Italian minimum wage for a year, as thanks for the team's faith in him to recover. Have there been other acts of selflessness by professional footballers, or is this an isolated incident? And what was the fellow's name?\"</strong></p> <p>The player was Damiano Tommasi, and the rather hazy details David can recall are largely correct. The Roma midfielder did indeed ask for the Italian minium wage - \u20ac1500 a month \u2013 because of his injury problems, caused, as it happens, by a clumsy tackle by Gerry Taggart.

  "<p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/10/1009.Immigration.gif\">Graphic: the trends</a></p> <p>Doctors, secondary school teachers and social workers from outside Europe will no longer be recruited to work in Britain under the points-based immigration system which is to come into force in November.</p> <p>The three are the largest occupations represented among 300,000 skilled jobs currently open to non-European Union migrants which will be excluded under the new system.</p> <p>The provisional list of shortage occupations published yesterday by the Home Office's migration advisory committee reduces the number of skilled jobs in Britain open to non-EU migrants from 1 million to 700,000. It is thought the changes will cut the level of skilled migration to Britain from outside Europe by between 30,000 and 70,000 people a year.</p> <p>The main list of shortage areas identified by the group of labour market economists is headed by construction managers involved in multimillion-pound projects, civil and chemical engineers, medical consultants, maths and science teachers, and ships officers to staff a newly growing merchant navy.</p> <p>It also includes unexpected occupations such as skilled ballet dancers and sheep shearers. The experts heard evidence from the Royal Ballet that very few British applicants had the required level of artistic excellence or aesthestics.</p> <p>The other exception will enable a group of 500 Australian and New Zealand shearers who travel the world working on up to 400 sheep a day to continue to operate in Britain, where they shear 20% of the UK flock.</p> <p>Manual frozen fish filleters are listed as a skilled shortage occupation in a list for Scotland. The decision is justified by the fact they have to work at minus 20C.</p> <p>The advisory committee, chaired by Professor David Metcalf, faced vigorous campaigns from the catering industry, especially Bangladeshi and Chinese restaurants, and care homes to be allowed to continue to employ non-EU migrants. In both cases importing unskilled labour is banned and both hoped that the skilled route would be opened up to their staff.</p> <p>The decision of the MAC to nominate a category of skilled chefs and cooks - defined as earning at least \u00a38.10 an hour - was welcomed by the Bangladesh Caterers Association, which said its members had 30,000 vacancies in Britain. But the inclusion of a pay benchmark for skilled care assistants brought warnings yesterday that some homes will have to close.</p> <p>The emphasis on engineering reflects major investment in electricity transmission projects and the Olympics.</p> <p>Metcalf said for about 10 occupations, such as midwives and welders, a claimed national shortage was not supported by much evidence. The MAC intends to look again at whether they should be added to the shortage list.</p> <p>The decision to exclude doctors and most nurses brings to an end more than 50 years in which the NHS has relied on the recruitment of overseas staff to keep hospitals and surgeries going. The MAC said this reflected the sharp increase in training programmes for nurses and doctors in Britain.</p> <p>It said there was no general shortage of nurses in Britain, although there remains a demand for specialists such as operating theatre nurses.</p> <p>Two occupations - textile trades and qualified veterinary nurses - were excluded from the shortage list because opening them up to overseas migrants would undermine attempts to train sufficient British staff.</p> <p>Also excluded are IT staff, architects and most skilled construction trades.</p> <p>Metcalf said the committee's approach was to assess whether it was sensible to fill shortages of skilled labour with immigration.</p> <p>The MAC report says that while increasing wages is one alternative to immigration, there are areas such as the social care sector, teaching and health where that is not a realistic short-term prospect.</p> <p>However, it adds that in \"the long run even in the public sector we would expect the relative wage in shortage occupations to rise. This implies that the cost of supplying these services will increase.</p> <p>\"Although we recognise that many public budgets may be fixed in the short term, in the longer run it would not be sensible to supply these important services on the basis of low-paid immigrant labour.\"</p> <p>The Home Office is to publish the final shortage occupation list next month but it is not expected to be much different before coming into effect in November.</p> <p>The immigration minister, Liam Byrne, said: \"This strict list means 30% fewer jobs are available to migrants via the shortage occupation route. Those that do come will need to work hard, play by the rules and speak English.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/10/1009.Immigration.gif\">Graphic: the trends</a></p>",
  "<p>Lilias Graham, who has died aged 91, devoted her life to working with those struggling to cope with troubled and poverty-stricken circumstances.</p> <p>For 20 years from 1952, her flat in the Gorbals district of Glasgow was a centre of constant activity - local people seeking advice, groups for women, the sound of children playing, volunteers who came to help and trainee social workers on placements from the LSE. This hectic life continued until redevelopment demolished the tenements and dispersed the people to housing estates on the edge of the city.</p> <p>In 1972 Lilias moved to Braendam, a country house near Stirling that she had inherited from an aunt. There she set up a holiday and respite centre, taking families from the Gorbals and elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Braendam Link group provided a meeting point in Glasgow for families between visits to the house. As retirement approached, Lilias gifted the house to the Braendam Trust (now the Lilias Graham Trust).</p> <p>Though her childhood was spent in Suffolk, Lilias was born in London, into a well-connected family with a keen social conscience. Her mother made regular visits to poor families in Ipswich; while on holiday, Lilias sometimes accompanied her paternal grandmother, the Duchess of Montrose, on visits to a home for unmarried mothers in Glasgow.</p> <p>After her own mother died in 1936, Lilias took over the running of the house, as well as training the church choir and doing voluntary work in east London. During the second world war, she was a sergeant cook in the ATS and later worked for the UN Refugee and Relief Agency (UNRRA) in Egypt, Palestine, Greece and refugee camps in the British zone of Austria. She then took a course at William Temple College, near Chester, designed to make Christianity relevant to social needs, and approached the Bishop of Glasgow about working among the city's poor. </p> <p>For the last few years of her life, Lilias returned to Suffolk to be near her brothers, Ian and Robin, and sister, Margaret, who survive her. At her funeral, her friend Richard Holloway, the former Bishop of Edinburgh, said of Lilias: \"What you saw was what was there, sheer goodness, rooted in practical Christian love.\"</p>",
  "<p>Airbus is to build a new components factory in Tunisia and off-load part of its Filton plant near Bristol to GKN this week under an accelerated \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.4bn) cost-savings plan to offset the strong euro.</p> <p>Louis Gallois, chief executive of EADS, parent of the European plane-maker, said yesterday that Airbus would take over existing plans from a French supplier to build the Tunisian plant and could set up shop in Mexico, India and north Africa. </p> <p>Airbus, which officially opens its first Chinese plant to build the A320 this month, has put on hold plans to sell off half a dozen plants in France and Germany, including two French plants due to be taken over by Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re. The French company wanted to build components in Tunisia.</p> <p>It is understood that John Hutton, business secretary, is expected in Bristol tomorrow to confirm that GKN will take over part of the Filton plant making composite components for new Airbus planes. The government will reportedly give the British engineering group \u00a360m as launch aid for its new investment, which could total \u00a3120m over the next five years. GKN could, in addition, pay \u00a3150m for taking over the plant.</p> <p>Gallois' comments came as EADS said it aimed to save an extra \u20ac1bn by 2012 on top of the savings of \u20ac2.1bn by 2010, under its Power8 restructuring plan.</p> <p>The EADS chief assured union leaders, who met as the Airbus European works council yesterday, that the new savings plan would entail no further job losses beyond the 10,000 already scheduled.</p> <p>He said: \"The growth in the market is such that we can do this [move outside Europe] without putting into question our current plants, which we will continue to modernise. At Airbus, output will grow by more than 50% between 2007 and 2011.\"</p> <p>Gallois indicated that EADS/Airbus would expand their presence in India because of the quality and quantity of engineers there, in north Africa because of lower costs, and in Mexico to get close to the US market. The group plans to build air-to-air refuelling tanker aircraft in Alabama if it wins a rerun Pentagon contest worth $40bn (\u00a322.5bn)</p> <p>Playing down the impact of the economic downturn on the aerospace industry, he said: \"We are not in the same situation as 2001. There is a slowdown but the sales campaigns are carrying on uninterrupted. There's no reason to panic.\"</p>",

  "<p>According to Tennessee Williams, depending on the kindness of strangers can have disastrous consequences. However Petra Barran's recent escapades suggest otherwise. In April of this year, she embarked on a nationwide tour in an ice cream van that she has converted into \"the country's first mobile chocolate bar\", offering homemade dessert in return for an evening meal and a night's board. Her journey has revealed a side of British hospitality far removed from the atomised existences that seem to dominate modern society.</p> <p>Having lived and travelled abroad for five years \"working on boats, looking after the super-rich\", Barran, now 32, returned home with no plans. \"I'd always been obsessed with baking cakes: producing something delicious, the result of my effort and love,\" she says. </p> <p>After visiting countries where chocolate was presented in interesting and avant-garde ways, Barran felt inspired to bring those ideas to the UK.</p> <p>From the cartoonish, bubbling fountains of the California Bay Area to the sophisticated edginess of Spanish producers, and the purity of the raw ingredient (cacao) in Mexico and Guatemala, overseas chocolate is awarded far greater culinary and cultural significance than in Britain. In fact Barran's assessment of the British relationship to chocolate sounds rather like the stereotype of our attitude to something else. \"It's a cheap thrill,\" she says. \"There's a naughty look, a glint in people's eyes, like they're buying drugs from you. Either that, or it's very formal and sniffy\".</p> <p>To learn the trade, Barran took a job at master chocolatier Pierre Marcolini's London store. Meanwhile, in her spare time, she refined her own recipes, such as hot chocolate rum souffle, white chocolate mousse, spiced chocolate fondant, Malteser muffins and chocolate Guinness cupcakes. Barran also set about creating the ultimate brownie. </p> <p>\"I can't walk past a brownie without trying it,\" she says. \"But it's almost impossible to get a decent one.\" Her criteria? \"A crispy, crunchy top layer almost like meringue, leading into cake and fudginess in the centre, with a sticky, dense texture and contrasting tastes.\"</p> <p>Once Barran's recipe repertoire was complete, a protracted search for a van began. Eventually she found one on Ebay that seemed suitable. The only sticking point was that it was located in Inverness, but after persuading a local acquaintance to take a look on her behalf, she bought it for \u00a33,200. Barran then travelled to Scotland to collect the van with a friend and the two of them spent a leisurely week driving back to London. A vague idea for an adventure around Britain started forming in her mind: \"A step away from the usual humdrum, to re-observe life through a chocolate-tinted prism.\"</p> <p>After a few false starts, Barran landed a pitch in east London's bustling Brick Lane and as soon as she had raised enough money, she hit the road. Selling her treats at festivals and outdoor events, Barran was always on the lookout for strangers to take her in for the night in return for one of her increasingly renowned desserts - chilled chocolate, amaretto, orange and almond terrine for example. \"I was combining two of our national loves: chocolate and pudding,\" she says. \"Pudding is what makes Brits tick. We're all so governed by it, whether we're overdoing it, trying to avoid it, or just pining for it.\"</p> <p>But the trip wasn't just about chocolate. \"It was about having a different conversation with different people every single night; entering someone's life from nowhere and then leaving again, back to nowhere\".</p> <p>Most people Barran approached were suspicious at first. But chocolate, she says, \"can melt the scowl off the most hardcore faces. It's funny - on the one hand, you might say it's only chocolate, on the other, would people have been so keen to let me into their houses without it? As soon as I offered to make them a chocolate pudding, they gave me instant access to their lives.\"</p> <p>Those who were receptive seemed taken by the notion of \"adventure for the sake of adventure\". \"Their enthusiasm was really touching,\" she says. Barran met her hosts via friends, her website and blog (which features pictures of the dinners and beds provided for her, and the puddings she made in return), as well as people she encountered randomly on her travels. \"At first it felt awkward, turning up never having met them before, but before long I loved it. And there was always a lot of booze flying around.\" </p> <p>Many of her encounters reflect a growing return to bygone goods-exchange systems. \"With all the crazy credit-crunch stuff going on, they're really attracted to the tangibility of bartering. You give somebody something real and they give you something real back.\"</p> <p>In Northumbria, \"James the forager\" took Barran into the woods by Hadrian's Wall to search for food, where they collected a supper of tiny daisy flowers, fat hen, red nettles and gorse. Like most people she met, he was extremely hospitable, even giving up his bedroom for her. A chef himself, James also insisted on making desert - \"the fluffiest, most perfect drop scones ever\", says Barran, who rustled up some Venezuelan Black chocolate sauce to go with them. </p> <p>In London, Barran was invited \"skip diving\" by her host, discovering a network of people sharing information about the whereabouts of \"hot\" skips. Her new friend, Rob, was \"an ex-public schoolboy trying to be free\". She joined him on his mission to escape bank accounts, Oyster cards, phone bills, jobs and rental agreements. \"We spent the whole day pulling cast-off food from manky old bins outside M&amp;S, Tesco, Costcutter and Somerfield. Back at the warehouse in which he lives, we eventually got around to eating dinner at 1am, sharing food with people who seemed like they hadn't had a decent meal in weeks,\" she recalls. Conversational topics included nomadism in Britain but thanks to the late hour, she had to write Rob an IOU for the pudding.</p> <p>The trip wouldn't have been complete without a visit to the van's original owners in Inverness. This time, their home was full of friends, with children \"in traditional Scottish outfits, performing dance routines and accordion recitals,\" she says. Barran made them a brownie fudge sundae for their trouble.</p> <p>If her experience is anything to go by, Britain is a far more benevolent place than we might generally believe: \"People were misty-eyed at the idea of me travelling around in a chocmobile, and were welcoming enough to provide me with keys to their homes, meals, laundry facilities, books, and more people to stay with. Perhaps I see the world through rose-tinted glasses, but I discovered a nation of smiling dreamers.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Check Petra Barran's whereabouts at <a href=\"http://www.chocstar.co.uk\">chocstar.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tell us how far your generosity would stretch for a chocolate pudding <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth\">theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth</a></p>",

  "<p>Lavish parties tend to leave a hangover as the problems of daily life, put aside for the celebrations, come crowding back. China's Olympic party is not likely to prove an exception. The full legacy of the extraordinary events of 2008 in the People's Republic of China will take many years to emerge, but in the short term, a number of pressing problems are clear.</p> <p>The Olympics, with its political project of displaying China's power as much to its own population as to the rest of the world, has been the prime focus of domestic propaganda for several years, rallying people behind the nationalist theme with the promise to situate China as a restored power. It worked: recent opinion polls have reported a strong feelgood effect, with high levels of satisfaction with the government and the direction of the country.</p> <p>But when the Paralympics closes, the leadership might feel the absence of the mobilising appeal of the whole event, with its power to galvanise the country's patriotic instincts and minimise the growing divisions in income, prospects and privilege that are the breeding ground of discontent.</p> <p>A colder, greyer, post-Olympic world is coming into focus, a world in which most of China's customers are cutting back on spending, inflation at home is running at least at 10% with no relief in sight, eroding the country's competitiveness, and in which China must face the new challenges of maintaining high growth and social stability with the constraints of limited resources, energy shortages, concern over climate change and environmental exhaustion. </p> <p>For the past decade, China's cheap manufactured goods have helped its customers - in particular, the developed economies - to keep inflation low. Now, with its manufacturing costs rising, China is more likely to be a contributor to increasing prices internationally. Neither energy nor raw materials are likely to get cheaper, and the cost of migrant labour - hitherto the cheap input that has fuelled everything from rebuilding China's cities to servicing its coastal factories - has risen sharply as industrial zones have spread inland and workers have found jobs closer to home. Employees have already made gains in wages and conditions, and many manufacturers, including Chinese firms, are looking at cheaper production sites.</p> <p>Planners know China's development model to date, while impressive in its results, is unsustainable: it is too carbon-intensive, too polluting and too inconsistent in its effects. Like every Asian tiger before it, China, the biggest tiger on the planet, has to meet the challenge of moving up the value chain, from T-shirts to hi-tech, from low-end production to high-value innovation, from energy-intensive to climate-friendly production. In recent years the early coastal industrial zones have begun to enter that stage, with waves of factory closures the harbingers of a new phase in the country's development. </p> <p>Managing the transition will be a formidable task, and a race against the clock. It will demand action on the distortions created by the expensive energy subsidies that militate against efficiency and other anomalies in China's hybrid economy, all at a time when real incomes - the source of much of the satisfaction registered with the state - are being squeezed. Meanwhile, time is running short in other ways: the future pensions and labour headache of the world's most rapidly ageing population; an acute water crisis and a gathering health bill from chronic air and water pollution - these are only the most conspicuous items on the list. </p> <p>A recent report found 70% of the villages surveyed in north China facing increasing water shortages, with ground water falling rapidly and agricultural production being severely constrained. Two-thirds of the cities, too, are short of water. Air quality, according to a World Bank report censored by the Chinese government, causes more than 600,000 premature deaths a year.</p> <p>The great efforts to clean up Beijing for the games allowed the city's residents to rediscover the lost pleasures of clean air. But the emergency measures that proved necessary in Beijing cannot be sustained. A longer, nationwide cleanup is urgent or the cumulative costs - in health, lost production and environmental damage - will be huge.</p> <p>There is potentially another unintended consequence of the Olympics. Millions of people around the world watched a display that presented China as modern, powerful, energetic and rich. The opulence of the ceremonies, the magnificence of the venues and the sheer scale of games were designed to impress, and will have changed the perception of China for many, precisely as the government intended.</p> <p>But China is also engaged in the global negotiations for the post-Kyoto regime, and its participation is essential if catastrophic climate change is to be avoided. Like other developing countries, China is pressing the developed world to finance its move to a low-carbon model, an unprecedented deviation from business as usual for a country at China's stage of development. Under the Kyoto principle of the polluter pays, developed countries - which are responsible for most past emissions - acknowledge this obligation, but it was never going to be easy to persuade sceptical taxpayers to deliver.</p> <p>Before the Olympics, for most western taxpayers China was a huge and rapidly developing country of which they knew virtually nothing. After the show, the abiding impression is not of the poverty that continues to afflict much of the nation: those images of deprivation in parts of China that do not measure up to the dream were not on view. </p> <p>Any nation wants to present its best face at such a time, but it may prove counterproductive. If China is rich enough to stage that show, western taxpayers may ask, why do they need our money to pursue a track of clean development? Western politicians struggling to make the case for the kind of radical resource transfers required may find themselves wishing the Olympic party had been just a little less opulent.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Isabel Hilton is editor of <a href=\"http://www.chinadialogue.net\">chinadialogue.net</a><br><a href=\"mailto:isabel.hilton@theguardian.com\">isabel.hilton@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Maybe Republicans are right. Maybe liberals aren't constitutionally cut out to be commander-in-chief. Not constitution as in 1787, but constitution as in backbone and gut-check. Panic, it seems, is their natural state. And so it is that every time John McCain lands some good <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/08/AR2008090801825.html?hpid=topnews\">polling numbers</a> they freak out and start talking about leaving for Canada.</p> <p>There are three reasons why they should calm down.</p> <p>First, it was always going to be close and those who never understood that are just hanging around with people who agree with themselves too often. Just because 79% think the country is going in the <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/right_direction_wrong_track/right_direction_or_wrong_track\">wrong direction</a> doesn't mean they all want it to go in the same direction. And the fact that Bush's <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/political_updates/president_bush_job_approval\"> approval ratings</a> are at 34% means there is a solid third of the country who will pretty much believe whatever they want to believe.</p> <p>Obama is a late finisher. Six weeks before the Iowa caucuses <a href=\"http://people-press.org/reports/questionnaires/374.pdf\">he trailed (pdf)</a> Clinton by 6% in Iowa, 19% in New Hampshire and 14% in South Carolina. We all know how that turned out. His campaign relies on field offices and grassroots contact, which takes longer and is more of a slow burn.</p> <p>But finally, and most importantly, the polls that really matter are not the national but the state polls. The US presidential election is not really a national election but 50 separate local ones. And on that front, even after the conventions Obama is in a commanding position. Obama needs 18 electoral college votes \u2013 more than John Kerry \u2013 to win. According to <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/\">pollster.com</a> there is not a single state that Kerry won where McCain is ahead. Conversely, there are two that Bush won \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/map/polling/\">Iowa and New Mexico</a> \u2013 where Obama maintains a commanding lead. That's 12 electoral votes. Then there are two \u2013 Michigan and New Hampshire \u2013 that Kerry won where Obama holds slight leads but which are toss-ups. That's 21 electoral votes. Then there are eight that Bush won \u2013 Montana, North Dakota, Nevada, Colorado, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina \u2013 which are toss-ups. Obama narrowly leads in four, McCain narrowly leads in three. One, Virginia, is a dead heat. That's 95 electoral votes.</p> <p>In other words, Obama is fighting this election entirely on McCain's territory. McCain is struggling to defend what he has. If they split those toss-ups even 80-20 in McCains' favour he still loses the election.</p> <p>That doesn't mean Obama's going to walk it. First of all, this year more than most polls are likely to be uniquely unreliable. White people have routinely lied to pollsters about their propensity to vote for a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">black candidate</a> in a bid to hide their racism. Meanwhile, Obama's base is heavily built on the young and the black who historically have been less likely to turn up than others. One may cancel the other out. The truth is, nobody really knows. (There is some reason to believe the Bradley effect \u2013 also known as the <a href=\"http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~dhopkins/wilder13.pdf\">Wilder effect (pdf)</a> \u2013 no longer holds. I'll believe it when I see it).</p> <p>In any case, there's a while to go before election day and it is perfectly possible that Obama will lose each roll of the dice. But it's unlikely. What it does mean is that the people who should really be panicking \u2013 and who clearly really are panicking because otherwise they wouldn't have picked Sarah Palin as a vice-presidential nominee \u2013 are the Republicans. I know which position I would rather be in. Democrats, meanwhile, should have a bit more faith that they have picked the right candidate. <a href=\"http://www.electoral-vote.com/\">Electoral-vote.com</a>, which uses a different method for calculating the slew of polls each day, projects an Obama victory of 281 to McCain's 230 with 27 votes tied. This time back in <a href=\"http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2004/Pres/Maps/Sep09.html\">2004</a> they projected Bush on 254 and Kerry on 243 with 41 votes tied. The good news is they got the numbers, if not the individual states, pretty much right back then. The bad news is all the tied votes went to Bush.</p>",
  "<p>They'll struggle to wring many headlines out of this ECB announcement. Having been spoiled for stories over the past six months the cricket media are now faced with one of the least surprising squad selections in recent memory, conforming almost exactly to the pundits' predictions. The stand-out decisions \u2013 the inclusion of Michael Vaughan in the central contracts list and of Ryan Sidebottom in the Stanford Super Series squad \u2013 were as easy to forecast as the August rains.</p> <p>As if they wanted to pour more water on the fire the selectors have swerved<br>further controversy by choosing the same 15 men for both the Stanford<br>matches and the one-day tour of India. It means there is space for both Alastair Cook and Ravi Bopara, and for Sidebottom and Steve Harmison. The only man to miss out from the recent one-day series over South Africa is Tim<br>Bresnan, and as he has taken only four wickets in his six international matches he hardly has good cause for complaint. Even Bresnan may yet return if Sidebottom fails to recover from the hip problem that has afflicted him in recent weeks.</p> <p>More significant than either the Test or the Stanford squads may be the incremental contracts handed to Tim Ambrose, Ravi Bopara, Samit Patel,<br>Matthew Prior, Owais Shah, Graeme Swann and Luke Wright, which will mean the ECB taking increasing control of the players' time and wages as they make further appearances for the national teams. England, it seems, have identified a nucleus of elite players for the next 12 months, meaning that it might be a while before we enjoy another DJ Pattinson.</p> <p>Given that players' egos and neuroses are going to need such careful management as the Stanford series unfolds, it is right that the selectors have avoided rash decisions. Even those omitted from that squad \u2013 Phil Mustard and Dimitri Mascarenhas will be rueing the manner in which they've drifted out of contention over 2008 \u2013 can take consolation from the fact that the Stanford Series is scheduled to run for the next five years. There will be future opportunities to cash in.</p> <p>An interesting aside to events in Antigua will be the performance of Andrew Strauss when Middlesex take on England. Otherwise, with that four-nil win over South Africa so fresh in the memory, the selection questions were all too easy to answer. Samit Patel and Harmison both did well enough to ensure their selection for the money match.</p> <p>Similarly, Kevin Pietersen's public confirmation that he wanted Vaughan to be available for the Test team ensured that we were also denied the pleasure of mulling over the merits of his case for inclusion. Regardless of what the rest of us thought, Pietersen and the management have never given any suggestion that Vaughan would be denied a contract. It was not even as though there was a convincing argument to be made for another batsmen in his place. His contribution as an ice-cool senior pro would certainly be a worthwhile temper to Pietersen's headstrong leadership style.</p> <p>The prospect of an unburdened Vaughan returning to anything like his best form with the bat is enticing enough to make his inclusion worthwhile, to say nothing of the debt of loyalty owed to him for his years of service. It is a shame that similar logic didn't apply in the case of England's other open secret \u2013 the end of Matthew Hoggard's Test career. There are few players in the history of the England team who have contributed so much and yet been discarded so abruptly and with so little ceremony. In contrast, Vaughan has been granted a chance to prove that the whispers about his declining eyesight and malfunctioning footwork were the product of the stress the captaincy was putting him under rather than the rust of age and fatigue.</p> <p>Somehow, though nothing would please me more than to watch Vaughan bat like he once did, I think it unlikely that he will thrive. Mike Atherton, who played a further 36 Tests after stepping down from the captaincy, actually averaged less in that time than he did over his whole career, which rather spoils the idea that he enjoyed a renaissance of form when he gave up leadership. Admittedly Atherton's health problems were more severe than<br>Vaughan's, but unless his form reaches its majestic best the case it is easy to imagine that the draw of earning some serious cash of his own in the Sky commentary box may well be too strong to resist.</p>",
  "<p>The minimum wage for young people in apprenticeships will rise by \u00a315 a week in a bid to boost vocational education, the skills secretary announced today.</p> <p>In a speech to the TUC congress in Brighton, John Denham also announced a \"clearing house\" for construction apprentices at risk of redundancy during the economic downturn so that they can be matched with new employers to complete their training. </p> <p>The skills secretary sought to champion the government's role in \"rescuing apprenticeships\" as part of its commitment to skills and as proof that the Labour government and unions are still bound by \"core values\". </p> <p>Trade union delegates have this week expressed anger at the government for being out of touch with ordinary workers following another round of low public sector pay settlements.</p> <p>Unions are also seething at the government's apparent resistance to imposing a windfall tax on energy firms in the face of rising household bills.</p> <p>Denham received lukewarm applause in a speech in which he sought to highlight that Labour still held the \"same\" values.</p> <p>Citing the economic downturn, the skills secretary told delegates: \"It is in these times of insecurity that the values of trade unions and the Labour movement are most important. </p> <p>\"This Labour government has been at our best when we have believed in our values. Our core belief is that we all do better for ourselves and our families if we look after each other.\"</p> <p>Denham said the new minimum wage, which comes into force next August, will benefit an estimated 26,000 apprentices (about 10%) in traditionally low-paid areas such hairdressing and social care \u2013 of which nine in 10 are women.</p> <p>Though the average apprentice is paid over \u00a3170 a week, bottom earners currently take home just \u00a380.</p> <p>He said: \"We will go on to make sure that they are a mainstream option for all young people and for adults in England. Within the next decade one in five young people will be able to take up an apprenticeship.\"</p> <p>The government aims to boost the number of 16- and 17-year-olds starting apprenticeships by 50,000 each year as part of plans to raise the educational leaving age to 18.</p> <p>The skills secretary said Labour had reversed the trend under the last Conservative government, when apprenticeships had been \"practically destroyed\". </p> <p>\"We have rescued apprenticeships,\" he said. \"We have trebled the number of people taking them up since 1997.\"</p> <p>Denham also told union delegates that the government would seek to end the reliance on the \"uncertain and fluctuating pool of migrant labour\" by creating 42,000 new construction apprenticeships by 2012. </p> <p>The government would ensure public sector contracts to secure training opportunities in the industry. </p> <p>The clearing house system would help ensure training was completed if a business was forced to close. </p> <p>Denham also promised cross-government support for anyone at risk of losing their jobs as a result of the \"great difficulties\" currently facing the construction industry. </p> <p>This could include transferring across to work delivering energy-saving measures to curb rising fuel bills, he said.</p> <p>He said: \"We are also making sure that anyone who might lose their jobs in house building is able to take up new, skilled opportunities \u2013 insulating homes and businesses and improving energy efficiency across the country.\"</p> <p>Commenting on the increase in minimum apprenticeship pay, the CBI's director of education &amp; skills policy, Susan Anderson, said: \"CBI members are committed to providing high quality, well paid apprenticeships. But there is a risk that this significant rise in minimum pay in England may lead to some employers reducing the number of apprentice opportunities on offer to young people.<br> \"The government still needs to deliver on its promises to cut red tape, reform qualifications to reflect employers' real skills needs and provide support for small firms. Without these changes our shared ambition of increasing the number of apprentice places will not be realised.\"</p>",
  "<p>Radio 2 presenter Sarah Kennedy has been censured by the BBC Trust for giving undue prominence to the Daily Telegraph in her newspaper reviews.</p> <p>The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee has upheld a complaint by a listener over a review aired on July 17 last year, which the complainant said amounted to commercial endorsement on Kennedy's early morning show. </p> <p>In its ruling, the committee ruled that \"the consistently high usage of the Daily Telegraph in the newspaper review as the foremost newspaper to be featured, given the range of newspapers available, amounted to undue prominence\". </p> <p>The ESC ruling, which was based on the July 17 Radio 2 breakfast show and a sample of other newspaper reviews on Sarah Kennedy programmes, added: \"The committee also agreed that the consistent use of the paper and verbal references to the paper, gave the impression of endorsing that particular newspaper over others. As such the committee concluded that this constituted a breach of the guidelines on product prominence.\"</p> <p>Management of Kennedy's show had given reassurances two years previously that \"Sarah Kennedy would take greater care in future about expressing personal opinions and that she had also started giving equal prominence to other newspapers\", the ESC added. The committee said that these assurances \"were no longer apparently being fulfilled\". </p> <p>In response to the ruling, the Radio 2 programme makers promised to rotate papers more during Kennedy's newspaper reviews, a promise which the committee said it \"welcomed\".</p> <p>However, the ESC accepted the programme team's assurances that the Telegraph's domination of the review was not influenced by any political or commercial pressures. </p> <p>A claim that Kennedy demonstrated political bias in positive comments she made about then London mayoral candidate Boris Johnson; and supposedly negative comments about Cherie Blair, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and about the subject of immigration from Eastern Europe was also rejected by the ESC. </p> <p>In a response to the complainant before they took the issue up with the ESC, Radio 2's editor of mainstream programming, Phil Hughes, said that Kennedy usually uses the Daily Telegraph because \"it has the most human interest stories in the most easily digestible form - even when stories appear in other papers they are simply easier to read from the Telegraph due to the paper's simple style\".</p> <p>Hughes added that the paper review is a \"personal trawl through the papers and is not a written journalistic piece\". </p> <p>\"It is designed to entertain and highlight for an early audience some interesting stories,\" he said.</p> <p>Hughes concluded: \"Sarah does not 'do' politics and court stories.

  "<p>It was Kenard, in the Korean store, with the handgun. That's who killed Omar Little. From the moment you saw him on the beach in Mexico, comfortable in a straw hat, the odds of the man completing one final, conclusive rip'n'run back in Baltimore were going to be long. But to die halfway through making an order (\"Let me get one of those...\" being his final words) seems a cruel way for anyone to go.</p> <p>The news of Omar's passing travels slowly. Bunk is quickly on the scene, communing one last time with the one mope with whom, over the course of these five seasons, he had built an understanding. But Chris and Snoop, for once, are in the dark, dreaming up new plans to catch their foe while he's already on a slab. At the Sun, Gus spikes a possible story (death by shooting of a 34-year-old male) in favour of a few paragraphs on a house fire. McNutty, meanwhile, is more interested in Bunk's other news \u2013 a warrant for the arrest of Chris Partlow \u2013 and how it might affect Lester's wire. Only a morgue attendant, who spots the wrong tag on his body bag, shows Omar the respect he deserves. </p> <p>Kenard will continue no doubt; the pre-teen kingpin will prevail. Spiteful, vindictive and, as we see in episode eight (entitled Two Down), self-confident. Omar barely registers the child's presence in the bullet-proofed store, but in a second he is on the floor, the victim of one clean shot to the head. Kenard stands over him, scared by what, you want to assume, is his first murder. Another second ticks by and he regains his composure, threatening to kill the screaming shop attendant too.</p> <p>What does it mean for the Wire that Omar, the closest thing the show had to a marketable commodity (my brother does have the T-shirt), is killed in this way? Nothing, probably. We didn't need to be told that violence can happen randomly in this programme, nor that characters don't always get their just desserts. That said, antagonising a city's drug dealers while squatting right in the heart of the projects with a penchant for going to the shops sporting only a dressing gown and matching shotgun might be said to be a habit that would attract trouble in the end. Omar, you will be missed.</p> <p>At this rate, so will Jimmy McNulty. Ten minutes after the death of Omar, McNutty and Keema are in Quantico to meet the Feds in what proves to be the funniest scene of the season. There to receive a psychological profile on the Baltimore homeless killer, McNutty is forced to try to keep his face straight and his eyes narrow as the profilers read out a detailed description that bears a frightening resemblance to a certain murder police.</p> <p>\"Someone without a college education who nonetheless feels himself superior to those with advanced education ... Someone who works within a bureaucratic service or quasi-public service from which he feels alienated ... Possibly a high-functioning alcoholic ...\" The list goes on. At least McNutty will be less inclined to dismiss such practices in future.</p> <p>At the same time as he's wasting the Feds' time, McNutty is also seeing his patronage in OT and pool cars the subject of threats from colleagues searching for a jolly. The warrant for Partlow's arrest means that a legitimate investigation could undermine his own duplicitous one. And finally, yet most importantly, he's had to tell Keema quite what the scam is and she's unwilling to take part. Will McNutty receive the wrong toe-tag when he's carried out of the service on a stretcher?</p> <p>\u00b7 Read Steve Busfield's blog on the episode <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/09/the_wire_season_five_episode_e.html\">here</a>.</p>",

From mist rising off glassy patches of river in the morning sun, to the noise and spray of Victoria Falls, there's one reason: the Zambezi.</p> <p>Lusaka, the country's unglamorous capital, may feel like a long way from the river that gives Zambia its name, but it's the best base for any traveller here. Six hours by road to the south-west lies Mosi-oa-Tunya (\"The smoke that thunders\" \u2013 the name for Victoria Falls in Lozi); three hours to the south-west are the altogether calmer delights of the lower Zambezi.</p> <p>I decide to head south-west first. My host, Katy, an adoptive Lusakan, is used to the Zambian roads, and in a 4x4 we set off for Kanyemba lodge for the weekend. The first 150km or so of road are extremely smooth. After that, it turns into a dirt track and we have to take a pontoon to cross the Kafue \u2013 the croc-infested tributary that gives us our first taste of river country. After a boneshaking half an hour or so, we're there \u2013 on the green banks of the Zambezi itself.</p> <p>It's vast \u2013 more than three times as wide as the Thames in central London \u2013 and separates Zambia from neighbouring Zimbabwe. We dump our bags in one of six thatched rondavels and walk down to the terrace. There, a motor boat awaits us. We climb aboard and sit in canvas chairs. Somehow bottles of beer have appeared in our hands. This is the life. </p> <p>The boat glides out across the river, making for the opposite bank. In between are reed-covered islands and sandbanks. Apart from the hum of the motor, the only sounds are the breeze in the grass and the odd exotic birdcall. After the past few days of airport waiting rooms and transfers, I finally feel as though I've arrived. One of our party spots the first big animal \u2013 we are on a kind of safari, after all \u2013 and it's a huge, mean-looking crocodile, about 10 metres away from us on the edge of one of the islets. Suddenly, it flicks itself into the river, the flash of its tail the last thing we see. There'll be no dangling of fingers in the water on this trip. </p> <p>On the sandy cliffs that form the Zimbabwean bank, emerald-green bee-eaters perch outside their nests. Herons, ibises, egrets, they're all here, and if I was a birdwatcher I would probably have already fainted with excitement. As it is, I'm content to watch the pods of hippos \u2013 there seem to be hundreds \u2013 and listen to them as they grunt to mark out their territory. There are also elephants, of course, which regularly swim to the islands in search of fresh vegetation. Because you're on the water, and not in danger of being charged, you can get much closer than on land. And the elephants don't seem to mind \u2013 they just carry on munching. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337260652\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/03/zambezi220.jpg\" alt=\"Along the Zambezi, Zambia\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Along the Zambezi. <br> Photograph: David Shariatmadari</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Shariatmadari</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After watching the sunset, followed by a spectacular moonrise, we return to the lodge in time for dinner, cooked by the chef, Eddison, before choosing our activities for the following day. From a choice of canoeing, walking safaris and village trips, we settle on an excursion to the lower Zambezi national park \u2013 an hour and a half downriver. That means an early start, but it gives us the chance to see the river at its most beautiful, as the first rays of sun warm the surface and send wisps of vapour into the still-freezing air. </p> <p>The park is sandwiched between the hills of the Zambezi escarpment and the river itself. It is home to lions, leopards and buffaloes as well as plenty of hippos, impala and baboons. There are elephants, too, but, sadly, the park managers are currently struggling to deal with a serious poaching problem. The night before our visit another had been shot. Between April and mid-July this year, 17 were killed in the park - the highest level of poaching in recent memory. The guides blame a surge in demand for ivory being used to supply the Chinese medicine trade. </p> <p>The next day we laze around before getting Riccardo, the Italian-Zambian owner of the lodge, to show us his latest project \u2013 the Kanyemba bushcamp, which (despite the name) is definitely aimed at the higher end of the market. It's located on an island that was once a holding place for captives in the Indian Ocean slave trade and, if you can put that grisly fact out of your mind, it's hard to imagine a more luxurious back-to-nature experience. The chalet we saw was like a treehouse with a five-star bedroom attached. There's even a bath and power shower with a view out over the reeds. </p> <p>After the stillness of the Lower Zambezi, next up is Victoria Falls, some 500km upstream. To get there you have to travel back to Lusaka (it would be nice to go by river, but one of the world's largest dams \u2013 the Kariba \u2013 blocks the way). After that it's an hour's flight or about six hours' coach drive to Livingstone, a town named in honour of the first European to set eyes on the falls 150 years ago. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337260653\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/03/falls220.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Falls, Zambia\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Falls, Zambia.<br> Photograph: Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Ward/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vic Falls is, of course, firmly on the tourist map and as a result there's a wider range of places to stay, from the backpacker hostel of choice, Fawlty Towers, to the five-star Royal Livingstone. The conventional wisdom says that the falls are better from the Zimbabwean side \u2013 here, again, the Zambezi forms the border between the two countries \u2013 but when you're right in front of the gigantic sheets of water, getting soaked and enjoying the sight of double rainbows, you're unlikely to feel short-changed. </p> <p>The remarkable thing about the falls is that, right until it tips over the edge, the Zambezi is still that calm, wide, island-dotted river. And then it plunges into a narrow gorge and changes character completely. To fully appreciate it, don't just walk along the ridge that faces the falls \u2013 go down to the \"boiling pot\" to see what happens when this huge body of water is forced into a channel only 50 metres wide. This is the roaring, white-water Zambezi, and there are no lazy hippos here. </p> <p>Back in Lusaka, I'm left to consider the relative merits of the two faces of this great river. The falls might be one of those see-before-you-die sights. I couldn't have visited Zambia and not gone. But the magic of Kanyemba was something totally unexpected, and for that reason, when it comes to watery experiences, the lower Zambezi wins hands down. </p> <h2>Getting there</h2> <p>Flights to London from Lusaka via Nairobi from \u00a3600, inc tax.<br>http://www.<a href=\"http://www.kenya-airways.com/home/\">kenya-airways.com/home/</a><br><a href=\"http://www.kanyemba.com/bushcamp/kanyembaislandbushcampeng.html\">Kanyemba Lodge</a> costs \u00a3166 per person per night including all meals and activities, with reduced rates for residents and last-minute deals.

On the island's east, a woman died when her house collapsed on her and a man was killed by a falling tree. Despite a series of hurricanes and tropical storms these were the first confirmed deaths in Cuba this season.</p> <p>The government ordered 1.2 million people to seek safety with friends and relatives or at government shelters.</p> <p>In Havana, where the hurricane was expected to unleash heavy winds and rain this morning, evacuations began in earnest yesterday afternoon.</p> <p>The government closed schools and government offices in the capital as people reinforced windows with wood, removed plants from balconies and formed long queues at bakeries.</p> <p>Nancy Nazal, who lives on the second floor of a block of flats overlooking the ocean, said authorities had told her to be prepared to evacuate and she was. \"The truth is, we are scared,\" she said.</p> <p>Gustav tore across western Cuba as a category four hurricane last month, damaging 100,000 homes and causing billions of dollars in damage. But no deaths were reported as a result of mandatory evacuations of at least 250,000 people.</p> <p>\"In all of Cuba's history, we have never had two hurricanes this close together,\" said Jose Rubiera, head of Cuba's meteorological service.</p> <p>Waves created by Ike crashed into five-storey apartment buildings, hurling heavy spray over their rooftops, and winds that uprooted trees.</p> <p>Falling utility poles crushed cars parked along narrow streets in the central city of Camag\u00fcey and the roaring wind transformed buildings of stone and brick into piles of rubble. </p> <p>Colonial columns were toppled and the ornate sculptures on the roofs of centuries-old buildings were smashed in the city, a Unesco world heritage site.</p> <p>\"I have never seen anything like it in my life.

  "<p>The UK's primary schools have bigger class sizes than almost every other developed country, despite ministers' injecting millions of pounds into keeping them low, an international study has revealed.</p> <p>UK state primaries have 24.5 pupils per class - the fourth largest of the 30 Western countries which make up the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p> <p>Only Japan, Korea and Turkey have more crowded classrooms in their primary schools, the OECD found in its annual report comparing education across the world.</p> <p>OECD countries have on average 21.5 pupils per class, the report, Education at a Glance 2008, said.</p> <p>The gap between private and state school class sizes is higher in the UK than in any other country with on average 13 more pupils in a state primary class than in a private one. </p> <p>In other OECD countries, private and state schools have similar class sizes.</p> <p>The UK fares better for pupils in their first few years of secondary school when the average class has 22.4 pupils - below the OECD average of 24 pupils per class.</p> <p>Other countries are overtaking the UK in the proportion of their young people graduating from university, the study found.</p> <p>In 2000, 37% of young people in the UK graduated - the fourth highest of the OECD countries and well above the then OECD average of 28%. </p> <p>But now the UK is struggling to keep pace with other countries and has dropped to 12th place. The UK has climbed to 39%, but the OECD average is 37% and eleven countries have overtaken the UK. These include Australia, Denmark, Ireland, Italy and Poland.</p> <p>Demand for degrees is booming across the OECD countries, the study shows. On average, 57% of school-leavers in OECD countries went on to university in 2006, compared with 37% in 1995. </p> <p>The UK has a higher proportion of school-leavers aged between 15 and 19 than most OECD countries. Only Mexico, Turkey and Israel have lower staying-on rates than the UK's 69.7%. The OECD average is 81.5%.</p> <p>The study found the UK invested more in children's pre-primary schooling - $6,420 (\u00a33,655) - than every other OECD country apart from Austria, Iceland and the United States.</p> <p>Some 11% of foreign students worldwide are enrolled in UK universities. This is higher than in Germany, France, Australia and Canada, but lower than in the United States, the study found.</p> <p>Andreas Schleicher, the chief author of the report and an OECD analyst, said: \"In terms of school education, the OECD indicators put the UK in a favourable light at least in terms of policies, the application of resources and access. But when it comes to translating those policies into improved learning, there is quite a gap between the UK and the most successful education systems, such as those in the US, the Netherlands and Japan. The UK has gone through a rapid expansion of its higher education, but this has levelled off and the UK is now no longer among the top.\"</p> <p>A DCSF spokesman said: \"Over the past 10 years we have seen steadily smaller class sizes and a better adult-pupil ratio thanks to our policies which see 150,000 more adults in classrooms. In 1997 there were 17 pupils per adult at primary level, now there are 12.<br> \"High quality teachers, assisted by dedicated teaching assistants, have made a major contribution to the sharp rise in standards over the past decade. Schemes such as Teach First have seen talented graduates teaching in some of the most challenging schools while the increase in teaching assistants gives teachers extra time to plan lessons and focus attention where it is needed. \"The OECD itself has praised England for lowering class sizes, along with consistent and strategically spent money to attract better quality teachers. Only last month the OECD said our combination of decentralisation, supporting infrastructure and incentives for local innovation and leadership, supported by targeted funding, exemplifies much of the best of current wisdom about large-scale school reform.\"</p> <p>Andrew Adonis, the schools minister, said he was pleased that OECD had recognised the high quality of teachers and high rewards for them in the UK.</p> <p>\"From early years to adult skills, the OECD has confirmed that we are targeting investment well and sticking with policies that work.</p> <p>\"Today's OECD data confirm, although it is for 2006, that we must do more to increase staying on in education when compared to our international partners. That is why, alongside increased investment in skills and training, we are legislating to ensure everyone has to stay in education or training until they are 18,\" he added.</p> <p>In a separate report, the right-leaning thinktank Civitas claims the number of infant school classes with more than 31 pupils has risen by 8% in the last year to 22,810.</p> <p>Anastasia de Waal, its head of family and education, argued for infant classes to be cut to 20 by deploying support staff to be class teachers and re-allocating school budgets to fund extra teachers.</p>",
  "<p>After September 11, early analysis depicted al-Qaida as a monolithic, terrorist organisation. Gradually, that view was modified to include other elements: the network of groups linked in a variety of ways to the \"hardcore\" leadership element, the ideology and, more recently, the free-floating self-radicalising \"homegrown\" cells or subgroups. </p> <p>The contrast between the 2004 attacks in Madrid \u2013 which had no significant direct link to al-Qaida \u2013 and the meticulously prepared, commissioned and executed strikes against embassies in East Africa in 1998 or in America in 2001 supported the view that al-Qaida had become less a group and more of an ideology.</p> <p>The evidence heard in this <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/3\">most recent plot</a> \u2013 it was known as the \"<a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/08/2\">Airlines plot</a>\" but the jury decided that in fact the conspirators did not aim, as the prosecution had said, to bring down transatlantic jets so will now have to be renamed \u2013 and other recent terrorist efforts in Europe and the Middle East appear to show that the al-Qaida leadership element, once consigned to the margins of militancy has made something of a comeback. Osama bin Laden and his Egyptian associate Ayman al-Zawahiri have been able to reconstitute at least some of the infrastructure and command capability that they had in Afghanistan in the late 1990s and lost in the aftermath of the 2001 war.</p> <p>Bin Laden and his associates, after several years of relative weakness, have now developed a system of makeshift but relatively effective training camps in their secure base of the Pakistani tribal areas which, though they no longer offer weeks of military training in guerrilla fighting, can still be effective, given the right material. The tribal areas also provide a key focus for propaganda and a base for the militants' media \u2013 one area where they have lost little of their ingenuity or efficacy.</p> <p>The key question is how connected the three convicted yesterday were to these militant leaders overseas. In many ways, the plot resembles the 7/7 bombings and the fertiliser bomb conspiracy which comprised a self-forming group of likeminded British-based individuals who, largely under their own steam, made their way, or at least sent members, to Pakistan to meet with relatively high-ranking individuals from al-Qaida. The latter took the raw material of the enthusiastic but ignorant volunteers and welded them into something more effective, adding a crucial \"x-factor\" of technological expertise, directions as to targeting and psychological edge. </p> <p>In this instance, the conspirators appear to have travelled themselves to Pakistan to work in a refugee camp at Chaman on the Afghan frontier in 2002. There, exposed to horrific poverty and victims of bombing in the war against the Taliban, their views hardened. By 2005 they were back in Pakistan and in contact with senior militants. In this, al-Qaida are doing what they have always done \u2013 taking the raw material of those attracted by the radical Islamic cause and welding them into something more effective with technological, logistic and targeting advice and assistance. This is what the group, which was founded in 1988, did through the 1990s from bases in Sudan and then Afghanistan, and it has always been one of its principal functions.</p> <p>Does this mean that the view of \"al-Qaida as ideology not organisation\" is defunct? Not necessarily. Al-Qaida is best seen as a complex and continually changing matrix. Its various elements are continually evolving \u2013 and so is the relationship between them.</p> <p>The importance of the ideology remains impressive. This most recent plot reveals how the last decade has seen the views and vision of men like Bin Laden \u2013 there are a host of less well-known ideologues who are also very influential \u2013 become established as the ideological market leader for angry young men in much of the Muslim world or Islamic immigrant communities. The men involved in the current conspiracy are typical of those for whom the extremist message resonates, particularly in the UK. In their late 20s (the average age for a British militant is 29), they are either second or third-generation immigrants of Pakistani origin (or converts) and come from a broad range of socio-economic backgrounds. </p> <p>The apparent formation of the group is also revealing. Security services no longer hunt for older \"preachers of hate\" or look for recruitment in so-called radical mosques. In the vast majority of cases, militants are recruited by peers, often friends or family, and almost always away from religious centres. Their group dynamics would be recognisable to any team of sportsmen, soldiers or criminals. Current research by intelligence services as diverse as those of Saudi Arabia, Holland and Australia is now concentrating on the factors that make people vulnerable to radicalisation and on the structure of so-called \"social networks\". From concentrating on al-Qaida the organisation in the immediate aftermath of 2001, analytic effort shifted to al-Qaida the ideology between 2003 and 2007. It is now shifting to al-Qaida and the individual.</p> <p>The defendants' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/1\">claimed</a> they were trying to \"get publicity\" for a film on the impact of western foreign policy on the Muslim world rather than to kill thousands of people over the Atlantic. In either case, the importance to the plotters of attracting attention via the media remains evident. The bombers were planning \"a spectacular\" which would use violence or its threat to exploit the potential of today's media to communicate their ideas to as many people as possible. For 20 years, Islamic militant leaders, whether formally part of al-Qaida or not, have had one basic aim: to radicalise and mobilise those who have so far failed to heed the call to arms. In this they are following a long terrorist tradition of \"propaganda by deed\". It is the response to that call which determines success or failure.</p>",
  "<p>I may not agree with a word they say, but I sincerely hope that the <a href=\"http://blogs.iht.com/tribtalk/business/green/?p=192\">six Greenpeace protesters</a> accused of causing criminal damage to Kingsnorth power station in Kent are found not guilty. The six are on trial at Maidstone Crown Court for causing \u00a330,000 of damage after they daubed the word \"Gordon\" on a smokestack chimney (they had planned to write \"Gordon, bin it\", but were arrested before they could finish the job). The right to protest has taken quite enough of a battering under New Labour without some forms of protest now being recast as \"criminal damage\".</p> <p>However, I am perturbed by the justifications put forward by the protesters for their paint-protesting antics. Instead of defending themselves on the basis that they, like the rest of us, should have the right to protest as loudly and spectacularly as they please, they have used scientific fact to defend their actions. Their defence team has pushed forward <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2225363/nasa-scientist-defends \">a scientist</a> and even <a href=\"http://www.medwaymessenger.co.uk/news/default.asp?article_id=47512\">an Inuit</a> to argue that the \"criminal damage\" at Kingsnorth was justified, scientifically, in order to prevent even greater damage being done to the environment by Kingsnorth's smoggy chimneys.</p> <p>This could set a dangerous precedent. In defending the protest in such narrow terms, Greenpeace is killing the spirit of political protest and possibly limiting the scope of demonstration in the future. The Kingsnorth demo represents a worrying shift from protest based on political ideals, which represent real people's interests, to protests carried out in the name of Science. This was no democratic protest springing from a desire to engage with and persuade the public, but rather a form of elite action, sanctioned by the findings of scientists. It was more akin to a religious demonstration executed by true believers in the gospel truth of global warming, than a protest built on passion or political conviction.</p> <p>This changes the nature of protest. In the past, protest involved fighting in public to try to establish the truth. In my teen years and my 20s, I went on more loud and rowdy protests than I care to remember, from opposing police racism in east London in 1993 to challenging the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. And every protest involved having lively debates with fellow marchers, having political run-ins with members of the public, and, of course, fighting tooth and catapult against mainstream \"truths\" about war, racism and other big issues in order to establish the real truth \u2013 as we understood it \u2013 about world events.</p> <p>By contrast, protest driven by scientific fact is about imposing an elite, already established \"Truth\", as discovered by scientists in laboratories, on to public debate. It has no time for true and meaningful engagement with the public, but rather is about arrogantly hailing The Truth from on high \u2013 from on top of a smokestack in the case of the six Greenpeace protesters, where, like Moses on Mount Sinai, they declared the climate change commandments. </p> <p>And because they claim to represent \"the future of the planet\" or \"future generations\" or even \"the biosphere\", these new protesters don't have to worry about engaging with the living, breathing, messy, awkward mass of the population. In the past, we tried to make our protests as populous as possible, on the basis that the more people we had the more powerful we were. Today's green protests get their power from scientific fact rather than from an engaged, agitated throng; they demonstrate on behalf of the planet rather than in the name of a convinced public. Thus their protests can appear aloof and elitist, the very opposite of democratic engagement.</p> <p>If scientific fact becomes the measuring stick of protest, a key justification for political action, then some forms of protest will be implicitly delegitimised. At a time when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/14/greenxenophobes \">some leading greens</a> claim there is scientific evidence that immigration leaves an ugly \"carbon footprint\", what will happen to those of those who want to protest for open borders and utterly free migration? What if we want to demand industrialisation in the Third World in order to increase material equality across the globe? Would such a protest be \"unscientific\", and thus illegitimate?</p> <p>The right to protest is important precisely because it allows the public to take ideas seriously, to have heated debates about the best way forward for a certain workplace, local community or for society itself, and to act on those ideas in the public realm, either by marching peacefully or fighting angrily. New Labour would like to disarm us of this right; it is also being inadvertently degraded by the new caste of Truth-wielding, greener-than-thou protesters who seem to think themselves above us rather than with us.</p>"
