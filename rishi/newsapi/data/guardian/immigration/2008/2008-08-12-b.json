  "<p>One thing is for sure. This week's operation in Georgia has displayed the failure of the west's policy of belligerence towards Vladimir Putin's Russia. The policy was meant to weaken Russia, and has strengthened it. The policy was meant to humiliate Russia with Nato encirclement, and has merely fed its neo-imperialism. The policy was meant to show that Russia \"understands only firmness\" and instead has shown the west as a bunch of tough-talking windbags.</p> <p>Georgia, a supposed western ally and applicant to Nato, has been treated by Russia to a brutal lesson in power politics. The west has lost all leverage and can do nothing. Seldom was a policy so crashingly stupid.</p> <p>Putin would die laughing if he read this week's American newspapers. The president, George Bush, declared the Russian invasion of Georgia \"disproportionate and unacceptable\". This is taken as a put-down to the vice-president, Dick Cheney, who declared the invasion \"will not go unanswered\", apparently something quite different. Bush says that great powers should not go about \"toppling governments in the 21st century\", as if he had never done such a thing. Cheney says that the invasion has \"damaged Russia's standing in the world\", as if Cheney gave a damn. The lobby for sanctions against Russia is reduced to threatening to boycott the winter Olympics. Big deal.</p> <p>Every student of the Caucasus has known since the fall of the Soviet empire that this part of the world was an explosion waiting to happen. The crisscrossing fault lines of ethnicity, religion and nationalism, fuelled by gas and oil, would not long survive the removal of the Red Army and communist discipline. There were too many old scores to settle, too much territory in dispute and too much wealth at stake - rivalries brilliantly portrayed in Kurban Said's classic novel of Edwardian Azerbaijan, Ali &amp; Nino.</p> <p>In every crisis the west craves goodies and baddies. The media finds it impossible to report a modern conflict without taking sides. In Yugoslavia, where a similar clash of separatist minorities occurred in the 1990s, coverage was so biased that Kosovo is still \"plucky little\" and the Serbs can still do no right.</p> <p>In South Ossetia both sides appear to have committed appalling atrocities, and can thus generate a sense of outrage in front of whatever camera is pointed at them. Georgia's government claimed the right to assert military control over its two dissident provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even if they were openly in league with Russia. Equally, Russia felt justified in stopping the consequent evictions and killings of its nationals in these provinces, in which it had a humanitarian locus as \"peacekeeper\".</p> <p>The difficulty is that entitlement and good sense are rarely in accord. Georgia may have been entitled to act, but was clearly unwise to do so. Russia may have been entitled to aid its people against an oppressor, but that is different from unleashing its notoriously inept and ruthless army, let alone bombing Georgia's capital and demanding a change in its government.</p> <p>What is clear is that the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, is a poor advertisement for a Columbia University education. He thought he could reoccupy South Ossetia and call Russia's bluff while Putin was away at the Olympics. He found it was not bluff. Putin was waiting for just such an invitation to humiliate a man he loathes, and to deter any other Russian border state from applying to join Nato, an organisation Russia had itself sought to join until it was rudely rebuffed.</p> <p>Saakashvili thought he could call on the support of his neoconservative allies in Washington. Tbilisi is one of the few world cities in which Bush's picture is a pin-up and where an avenue is named after him. It turned out that such \"support\" was mere words. America is otherwise engaged in wars that bear a marked resemblance to those waged by Putin. It defended the Kurdish enclaves against Saddam Hussein. It sought regime change in Serbia and Afghanistan. As Putin's troops in South Ossetia were staging a passable imitation of the US 101st Airborne entering Iraq, Bush was studiously watching beach volleyball in Beijing.</p> <p>The truth is that the world has no conceptual framework for adjudicating, let alone resolving, these timeless border conflicts. Where poverty is rife, it takes only a clan war and a ready supply of guns for hostilities to break out. The only question is how to stop them escalating.</p> <p>Once such conflicts could be quarantined by the United Nations' requirement to respect national sovereignty. That has been shot to pieces by the liberal interventionism of George Bush and Tony Blair. The result has reinvigorated separatist movements across the world. Small-statism is not an evil in itself: witness its quadrennial festival at the Olympics. But the process of achieving it is usually bitter and bloody.</p> <p>The west's eagerness to intervene in favour of partition, manifest in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Sudan, is more than meddling. It encouraged every oppressed people and province on earth to be \"the mouse that roared\", to think it could ensnare a great power in its cause.</p> <p>The parallels are glaring. If we backed Kosovo against the Serbs, why not back South Ossetia against the Georgians? But if we backed the Kurds against the Iraqis, why not the Georgians against Russia? Indeed, had Nato admitted Georgia to full membership, there is no knowing what Caucasian horror might have ensued from the resulting treaty obligation. Decisions which in Washington and London may seem casual gestures of ideological solidarity can mean peace and war on the ground.</p> <p>I retain an archaic belief that the old UN principle of non-interference, coupled with a realpolitik acceptance of \"great power\" spheres of influence, is still a roughly stable basis for international relations. It may on occasions be qualified by soft-power diplomacy and humanitarian relief. It may demand an abstinence from kneejerk gestures in favour of leaving things to sort themselves out (as in Zimbabwe). But liberal interventionism, especially when it leads to military and economic aggression, means one costly adventure after another - and usually failure.</p> <p>The west has done everything to isolate Putin, as he rides the tiger of Russian emergence from everlasting dictatorship. This has encouraged him to care not a fig for world opinion. Equally the west has encouraged Saakashvili to taunt Putin beyond endurance. The policy has led to war. If ever there were a place just to leave alone, it is surely the Caucasus.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\"><br>simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Saturday August 16 2008.

  "<p>An ice-cream van is an odd platform for a political diatribe, and Mr Softee is an unlikely name for former union hardman Sean Farrell to travel under. But needs must. He was in his late 20s in 1993 when Littleton Colliery closed down, putting him and more than 600 colleagues out of work. It was the last deep mine in the Cannock area of Staffordshire, and Farrell had to earn a living somehow. Getting a job in a local factory was not easy after being branded as \"Young Scargill\" during the miners' strike of the mid-1980s.</p> <p>On a hot summer's day, selling cornets outside a garden centre must seem infinitely preferable to \"crawling around coal faces\", as Farrell puts it. His gleaming white overall is almost confirmation of the point - a telling contrast with the state of his clothes when he emerged from working underground. \"But I don't regret having been down the pit,\" he says, forcibly. \"You couldn't put a price on the time we spent together fighting against the forces of individualism and greed.\" </p> <p>Farrell, now 44, is one of the former miners featured in Littleton, an exhibition of photographs and extensive interviews that opens at Wolverhampton's Light House media centre on Friday and moves to the National Coal Mining Museum, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, in the new year. Watching him serve an Asian family with warmth and courtesy, it comes as a surprise to hear that he briefly became a football hooligan after the strike, when his bitterness against the police was still burning. \"They'd already criminalised thousands of us,\" he claims, \"as the instruments of a political decision to get rid of the NUM [National Union of Mineworkers]\".</p> <p><strong>Political education</strong></p> <p>He was an unusual member of Wolverhampton Wanderers' Yam-Yam Army, insofar as he carried the Guardian to away matches and travelled first class on the train if he could get away with it. On one trip to London, he found himself sitting opposite Norman Fowler, still a Conservative cabinet member at the time. Before they had reached Euston, three businessmen had given Farrell a points decision over Fowler in the resulting lively discussion, and three Yam-Yam \"soldiers\" who had wandered through from standard class, had been reduced to slack-jawed astonishment. \"They didn't know that the union had given me a good political and economic education on day-release at Keele University,\" Young Scargill recalls.</p> <p>He pauses to receive a framed photo of himself from the man behind the Littleton exhibition, photographer Luke Unsworth, who he rewards with a double 99 smothered in raspberry sauce. </p> <p>Unsworth, 37, the son of a local GP, lived in Cannock until he was 10. It was very much a mining area at the time, but the local pits all closed down in the 12 years after he left, making more than 2,000 men unemployed. \"I remember hearing about the Littleton closure when I was away at college,\" Unsworth says. \"So I came back and took some pictures on the last day.\"</p> <p>They look particularly evocative for being in black and white. Most evocative of all, perhaps, are shots of the detritus of working lives brought summarily to an end. A small pile of working clothes, including pit boots and a helmet, lies abandoned on the locker-room floor. \"Turn shower off after use,\" says a sign on soot-streaked tiles.</p> <p>\"Within two months the whole place had been flattened,\" says Unsworth, who went back recently, with Arts Council funding, to find out what happened to those men and to photograph some of them in colour. Three are running successful businesses, but most have jobs that pay lower wages than they earned at the pit. Some are retired through age, others through incapacity brought about by the pressures of digging for coal in difficult conditions.</p> <p>Chris Lilburn, 47, hasn't worked much since 1989, when, still a young man, he had to leave the pit because of a severe spinal condition. He lives close to his former place of employment, in a council house that he shares with his wife Sheena, who is a barmaid at the Littleton Arms, two of his four children, a Bedlington whippet, and two Harris hawks. </p> <p>Scanning the skies for birds was always a traditional weekend pastime for men whose working horizons were cramped and dark. But these brooding raptors are rather more exotic than the average racing pigeon. They look as though they would be more at home perched on a cactus on the Texas-Mexico border than in a small back garden in Staffordshire. Lilburn feeds them a couple of dead chicks, which look horribly like gassed pit canaries, and says: \"I fly hawks as a hobby to keep my mind occupied. My dad kept pigeons. He came down here from Blyth in Northumberland, back in the 60s. Other lads came from Scotland when their pits were worked out.\" He points to a nearby former National Coal Board estate where the roads have Scottish names.</p> <p>These were economic migrants who had \"got on their bikes\" to look for work. But in the end, they and their sons ran out of cycle track. Miners in the Midlands were better placed than most to find alternative employment when the pits closed. Indeed, some former Littleton employees found jobs in the drop forging factories of the Black Country until they, too, started to close down. </p> <p>On the way back from Lilburn's house, we pass the site of the old pit, now a new estate called Littleton Green, made up of starter homes on roads with names such as Colliers Way. Further on, Unsworth struggles to locate the former miners' club because the building is obscured by an Asda hypermarket. \"Doing this 15 years after the closure,\" he muses, \"means that enough time has elapsed to get some perspective.\"</p> <p><strong>Buggering up the planet</strong></p> <p>One example comes on the DVD that goes with the exhibition, which has Farrell reflecting on the role of fossil fuels in \"buggering up the planet\". When I put this to him at the ice-cream van, he says: \"There has never been the political will to back the technology that could make coal clean. </p> <p>\"Remember, too, that we don't really know yet what the legacy of nuclear power will be,\" he adds, before ripping off a piece of kitchen roll and wiping down the counter for the umpteenth time with antibacterial cleaner.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Littleton is at the <a href=\"http://www.light-house.co.uk/\">Light House</a>, Wolverhampton, from August 15 to September 19, and at the <a href=\"http://www.ncm.org.uk/\">National Coal Mining Museum</a>, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, from January 26 to April 26 2009.</p>",
  "<p>Even before the fighting that claimed so many lives, Tskhinvali, the putative capital of South Ossetia, was a pretty miserable place. Stalin Street (really) was its one and only proper thoroughfare; it had a tiny market with a couple of old women selling vegetables and batteries, and billboards celebrating eternal Ossetian-Russian friendship. A couple of miles away, bored Georgians soldiers sat keeping warm around a brazier. </p> <p>When I visited it a few months ago, South Ossetia seemed like the end of the world, not the place that would spark a new war in the Caucasus. It was one of the four so-called \"frozen conflicts\" of the former Soviet Union and, as it had been for years, still very much in the deep freeze.</p> <p>The mood was not much different in Sokhumi, the capital of Abkhazia, to the west. This city by the Black Sea, much of which remains in ruins from the war of the early 1990s, was once the holiday playground of the Soviet elite. Now old men played chess under gently swaying palms in front of wrecked hotels, and I visited a memorial for the Abkhaz soldiers who had died fighting the Georgians. At the Inguri river, where you crossed from Georgia proper, the Georgians had erected a sculpture of a huge pistol pointing north to Abkhazia - but in a futile gesture the barrel had been tied in a knot.</p> <p>South Ossetia and Abkhazia both broke away from Georgia in savage fighting when the Soviet Union disintegrated. The other two \"frozen conflicts\" in this region are Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave wrenched from Azerbaijan, and Transnistria, whose Slav population rebelled against Moldova, whose people and language are closely related to Romania. All are the unhappy legacies of Stalinist map-making, lines drawn in a period when the wishes of people counted for little and the demise of the Soviet Union was beyond imagination. All are unrecognised but exist as de facto states, albeit with support from Russia and, in Nagorno-Karabakh's case, Armenia.</p> <p>Take South Ossetia, which like Abkhazia had autonomous status within Soviet Georgia. Although many South Ossetians live in Tbilisi and elsewhere in Georgia, its people are really connected in terms of family, kin and language with North Ossetia, which is now in Russia, across the mountains to which it is connected through the Roki tunnel.</p> <p>Ossetians speak a language related to Persian and believe (truly) that the King Arthur of British myth was actually an Ossetian. I found billboards in Tskhinvali emblazoned with pictures of men dressed as knights in armour celebrating the 17th anniversary of South Ossetia's declaration of independence.</p> <p>Its population is tiny - somewhere between 22,000, as the Georgians claim, and 70,000, according to the South Ossetians. The numbers vary not least because, as there is no work (and no university) in South Ossetia, many go to Russia and only come home for the holidays.</p> <p>Even before last week, South Ossetia was hardly a candidate to be a viable state, especially as large swathes of it - as much as a third - were held by the Georgians. Only 800 metres separated the centre of one Georgian-controlled village from Tskhinvali. The Georgians had recently built a brand new cinema and sports complex in that village, and roads and infrastructure were being upgraded. </p> <p>The head of the Georgian administration for South Ossetia was a burly former military man who had defected from the separatists. He cut little ice in Tskhinvali, where officials scoffed at his notion of striking a deal and making peace with Georgia. Indeed, their plans were rather more ambitious.</p> <p>\"Our aim is unification with North Ossetia,\" Alan Pliev, the deputy foreign minister of South Ossetia, told me in his broom cupboard of an office. \"We don't know if that would be as part of Russia or as a separate united Ossetian state.\" Juri Dzittsojty, deputy speaker of parliament, says: \"I would prefer there to be an independent and united Ossetia, but today it is not possible. It is safer to be with Russia. The main aim of the struggle is to be independent of Georgia.\"</p> <p>A few hours' drive away, along the road now cut by Russian troops, the Abkhaz dream was a different one. Their goal is simply to hang on to what they have got. And here's the rub. Before the Abkhaz war of the early 1990s, less than 18% of its population were ethnic Abkhaz. Today, of some 200,000 people, this group still constitutes only 45% of its people, and hundreds of thousands of Georgians who left Abkhazia in the 1990s want to return home. The Abkhaz, who are in firm control of the government and of all levers of power, argue that to allow more of these refugees back than they have already permitted would simply be to turn back the clock and to make the Abkhaz once more a small minority in their own homeland.</p> <p>In the foreign ministry of the unrecognised republic I waited to see Maxim Guinja, Abkhazia's deputy foreign minister. Then he came out, and before we talked he tidied away some flags in the waiting room. There had just been a meeting in Sokhumi of the leaders of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria.</p> <p>\"We became 18% because of Soviet rule and Russian before that,\" he explained. Abkhaz were deported to Siberia and Turkey, and Georgians settled here. \"My grandfather was put on a train in 1937 with thousands of others, and the next day a train arrived with Georgian settlers. No one returned from Siberia.\" His dream is that one day hundreds of thousands of Abkhaz - or rather their descendants who fled the Tsarist invasion to Turkey in the late 19th century - will come home. A pipe dream? Maybe, but Guinja said that he had a very clear precedent in mind. Israel did it, so why not Abkhazia?</p> <p>In the meantime, the Abkhaz have to play gingerly with the Russians, whom they distrust as much the Ossetians trust them. \"For Russia, Abkhazia is just a card that can be played,\" I was told by Leyla Taniya, who runs a thinktank in Sokhumi. \"Abkhazia is linked to Russia, and Russia is the only country that actually cooperates with Abkhazia, and today many are afraid this could lead to our political absorption.\" She wants to correct a \"common misunderstanding\" in the west: despite its small size, Abkhazia \"is not a Russian puppet\".</p> <p>It is easy to comprehend why such a misunderstanding should exist. The Abkhaz, like the South Ossetians, have all been given Russian passports and vote in Russian elections, even though their unrecognised statelets are legally part of Georgia. They use the rouble, their people work and study in Russia and they speak Russian at least as much as Abkhaz or Ossetian. Their elderly receive their pensions from Russia. And, as the last few days have helped demonstrate, without Russian military support, it is doubtful whether the breakaways would still exist.</p> <p>Yesterday, Abkhazia began a military operation to take back a strategic sliver of territory held by the Georgians within Abkhazia. They could do this because Russian troops had struck far outside Abkhaz territory, routing the Georgian forces. No wonder everyone was so relaxed when I was in Sokhumi. I went to see Stanislav Lakoba, the Abkhaz official in charge of security. Georgia, I put it to him, was pouring 10% of its GDP into its army, was bidding to join Nato, had intensely courted the US and was demanding that Russia pull its so-called peacekeeping troops out of Abkhazia, 14 years after their deployment. \"Georgia just screams about it,\" he said laconically. \"It would just mean suicide if they attacked.\" He obviously knew what he was talking about.</p> <p>Despite its massive military support for the breakaways, the curious thing is that Russia does not actually want their full secession. It is a case of, \"Listen to what I say, not what I do.\" After battling separatists in Chechnya and beyond for well over a decade, Moscow is afraid of anything that might set a precedent and encourage the break-up of the Russian Federation. It is not the only big power with such concerns: China is nervous about anything that might boost separatist hopes in Tibet or Xinjiang, let alone Taiwan.</p> <p>This year the argument over breakaways and precedents has reached fever pitch, and the reason for that is Kosovo. On February 17, Kosovo, which has a population of some two million, 90% of whom are ethnic Albanians, declared independence from Serbia. Serbia of course rejects its independence, as does Russia, China and indeed the majority of countries in the world, including Georgia. Twenty out of 27 EU states have recognised it, however, alongside the US and other western countries. But in doing so these 45 states seem to have crossed a legal Rubicon. Until then, the only new states in Europe had been the six republics of the old Yugoslavia, such as Croatia or Bosnia, the 15 former Soviet republics and the Czech and Slovak republics. Kosovo is different. Like the four post-Soviet breakaways, it was a province or part of an existing republic. So, argued Serb leaders, it did not have the same right to independence as the republics did. \"Yes, we do,\" argued the Kosovo Albanians. Their struggle, they argued, was based on the legal right of a people to self-determination - just like the Serbs argued in 1991 when they briefly set up a breakaway republic of Krajina in Croatia.</p> <p>Quite simply then, in Kosovo as in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two pillars of international law - that is to say, the territorial integrity of states versus self-determination - stand in stark opposition to one another.</p> <p>Hence Russia's refusal to back Kosovo's independence. \"The threat of a disintegrating Russia - comparable to the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 - is still today seen as a very real threat by the Kremlin and the Russian elite,\" says Pavel Felgenhauer, a leading Russian commentator. \"The west is seen today by many in the Russian elite and public as a threatening force that is plotting to tear Russia apart and rob it of its natural resources. By supporting Serbia's right to veto Kosovo's secession, the Kremlin clearly believes that it is defending Russia's undisputed right to sustain its territorial integrity by any means available.\"</p> <p>Of course, Russia is interested in its territorial integrity, not Georgia's. By supporting Abkhazia and South Ossetia, it has the means to keep Georgia at its mercy and prevent it from following the pro-western path chosen by its electorate. But beyond that, it has little real interest in the breakaway states. Where the EU has poured billions into the reconstruction of Sarajevo and other Balkan cities ruined by wars of the 1990s, Russia has spent not a kopek in rebuilding Sokhumi or Tskhinvali.</p> <p>In September, Serbia will ask the General Assembly of the United Nations to ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to hand down an advisory opinion on whether Kosovo's declaration of independence was legal or not. If this ever happens, the ruling could have tremendous impact - or not, as the case may be. If Kosovo's 1.8 million people can declare independence and be recognised without the permission of Serbia, then so can Abkhazia or South Ossetia, to say nothing of the Republika Srpska (the Serb part of Bosnia), Iraqi Kurdistan and - who knows? - one day perhaps even Catalonia or the Basque country. </p> <p>On the other hand, the ICJ could declare that Kosovo's declaration was indeed illegal - and then what? Not much, probably. In 1975, the ICJ ruled that the people of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara had the right to self-determination. This was disputed by Morocco, which had occupied the country. Now, 34 years later, Morocco, a good friend of the west, is still occupying Western Sahara, most of the population has been driven out and lives in miserable camps in the Algerian Sahara, and the Moroccans have built a wall around the country to keep separatist guerrillas out. No one outside the region cares a hoot about them because, when it comes to these types of conflicts, hypocrisy is everyone's order of the day.</p> <p>What it comes down to is simple: being in the right place at the right time and having the right friends with the right guns and interests. Precedent, for all of the diplomats' fear of the word, is only part of it. It is where you are on the map and what you can get away with that counts. In 2002, on a trip to Iraqi Kurdistan, I was struck by the way the Kurds' homeland had been carved up as the Ottoman empire collapsed. Few Kurds I met then made any secret of their desire not just to achieve independence from Iraq but also to act as a vanguard that would eventually rally Kurds from Iran, Syria, and Turkey into one large Kurdish state.</p> <p>I asked one official if the aim of a Kurdish federal unit in Iraq was to provide an example for Kurds in Turkey and so that later they could join together. \"Yes,\" he said. \"That's the aim.\" Then, embarrassed, he added: \"But don't write that down.\" Musa Ali Bakr, the man who was then in charge of refugees in the Kurdish region of Dahuk, explained that if the Iraqi Kurds moved too quickly their neighbours would strangle them by closing the borders. He then summed up what for me then was the Kurdish dilemma, but I now realise is really the dictum of all successful separatists: \"If you are sick, you visit the doctor. He prescribes the medicine. You take a spoonful three times a day and eventually you are better, you are free. However, if you drank the whole bottle all at once, it would kill you.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tim Judah covers the Balkans for the Economist.

  "<p>Mexico has deployed a hastily formed anti-kidnapping force after public outrage over an increase in the number of kidnappings across the country, and evidence that police officers are among the most vicious perpetrators.</p> <p>The federal government has deployed the new force in five operational centres, which it says has the latest technology and crime-fighting expertise. The unit's 300 agents are also to be paid well and regularly submitted to strict honesty tests, all part of an effort to convince the public that this time they can trust the police.</p> <p>The avalanche of security measures follows the discovery two weeks ago of the decomposing body of the 14-year-old son of a well known businessman. Fernando Mart\u00ed had been killed by his kidnappers and left in the boot of a stolen car despite payment of a ransom of over 5m pesos (\u00a3265,000). </p> <p>He had been abducted in June along with his driver, who's body was discovered soon after. His bodyguard was left for dead but survived.</p> <p>The kidnapping took place after the boy's car was stopped at a police roadblock near the National Autonomous University of Mexico in the south of the capital. Detectives are investigating the involvement of a gang known to involve police officers called La Banda de La Flor (the flower gang), so called because of their ritual of putting flowers by messages. </p> <p>As part of the initiative to crackdown on the crime, President Calder\u00f3n called on all levels of government to \"purge, modernise and professionalise the municipal, state and federal level police forces\".

  "<p>The taxi driver looks doubtful as he drives away. I don't blame him. He has dropped me at what looks like a shabby warehouse on a deserted industrial estate in Birmingham. Can this really be the venue for one of this year's most eagerly awaited opera productions? But the warehouse, formerly the factory floor of the Sherborne rubber company, will shortly be transformed into the setting for Graham Vick's new walkabout production of Mozart's Idomeneo - just as soon as 2,500 tonnes of earth have been delivered. </p> <p>For the moment, it's just a big hangar with mounds of soil spread around. A flat tyre on the earth-moving machinery has put things behind schedule, so the 50 acting extras are rehearsing in the block next door, which is condemned. These actors, and their counterparts in the chorus, are what make Birmingham Opera Company what it is. All are amateurs, recruited from the local community - although, when you see them rehearse a scene of religious ecstasy with assurance and imagination, it's hard to believe they're not professionals. </p> <p>In age, gender and race, Vick's cast represent a cross-section of the city's population - and not one is an opera fan. Or at least, they weren't. Seven weeks of rehearsing - twice a week, alongside professional soloists and an internationally renowned production team - has changed that. Listening to Vick explaining the context of a particular passage, with tenor Paul Nilon singing an emotive illustration, it's not hard to see why: Vick must be one of the most inspiring and eloquent advocates of opera today, with a knack for boiling down centuries of performing tradition to basic principles.</p> <p>Even over a curry after a three-hour rehearsal, Vick still speaks with the passion of an orator, full of the outspokenness that has won him enemies as well as friends during a long career. Why Idomeneo? This 1781 work - in which the king of Crete cheats death at sea by making a bargain with Poseidon, promising to sacrifice the first human he sees on shore, only to find that that person is his own son - is often regarded as problematic among Mozart's operas. \"It's a difficult one to crack,\" admits Vick, adding that, \"It's a great opera, a work of serious genius. The father-son relationship is rich and powerful. But you have to do all the recitatives.\" And, he adds, you have to do them in a way that people can understand - which means singing in English, another thing Vick is evangelical about. </p> <p>Vick's association with Birmingham dates from 1987, when he founded City of Birmingham Touring Opera, a small-scale venture that took challenging work to out-of-the-way places. By 2000, however, \"there were too many BMWs in the car park - and I can say that, because I drive one myself. I had originally intended the company to become site-specific but never managed it, because touring used to be the big god; if you toured, you got funding. But in order to tour, you have to have a product to sell. That wasn't what I wanted.\"</p> <p>And so, in 2001, the site-specific BOC was born. The first production, Berg's Wozzeck, took place in 2001 in a dilapidated warehouse. After that came Fidelio in a big top, Candide in a car parts factory, Monteverdi's Ulysses Comes Home in an ice rink, and Don Giovanni (under the title He Had it Coming) in the disused Municipal Bank. Then, in November last year, Vick transferred the Traviata he had created for the Verona opera festival to Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This involved 300 local extras and was a huge risk, but it paid off: almost 9,600 people saw the show, and 68% of them were first-time opera-goers.</p> <p>So the following month, when Arts Council England announced that it was axing BOC's funding, Vick felt \"disbelief\" - a sentiment shared by many others. BOC had seemed a model of relevant, challenging outreach. A difficult winter followed. \"We had a great deal of support,\" says Vick. \"The appeal was listened to and we got the funding back. So all fairness to the Arts Council for that.\" </p> <p>A certain amount of chaos is perhaps integral to the BOC experience. The volunteers are managed so that around half the people on any one project are newcomers; there is no established team. \"I don't want to create an opera company in that sense,\" says Vick. \"It's a floating, fluid relationship with a city.\" The audience are largely first-timers, who come to support family and friends. \"It offers a conduit, which is the opposite of what you get across an orchestra pit, with an all-white cast and chorus.\" Does Vick consciously cast a proportion of black singers? He pauses. \"Yes. With great care. I consciously set out more or less to match the demographic of the city.\"</p> <p>The BOC model is unique, but Vick has had interest from international companies, keen for him to try something similar with them. They will have to meet his exacting standards: no corners can be cut. \"The fundamental problem opera has,\" he says, \"is that to do it well costs a lot of money.\" So what is the argument for subsidised opera on this scale? \"Without subsidy, it won't exist. Anyone in this show will tell you what opera can do for them that nothing else can. It's a luxury, but so are most things. These events become very important to these people's lives. They buy the CDs, they listen, they go to see other shows.\"</p> <p>So who is Vick doing this for? The professionals? The volunteers? The audience? \"I'm doing it for everybody,\" he says. Including himself? \"Yes, absolutely.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> King Idomeneo is at the Sherborne Building, Ladywood, Birmingham, until August 23.

  "<p>Roy Koerner, more commonly known as Fritz, who has died aged 75, was one of the four members of Sir Wally Herbert's British Transarctic Expedition which, on April 5 1969, stood at the North Pole. It was the halfway point of their dog-sled trip across the Arctic Ocean from Point Barrow, Alaska to the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, a total distance of 3,620 miles. The first surface-crossing of the Arctic Ocean, theirs was only the second confirmed expedition to reach the North Pole. Data collected from Koerner's later work on polar ice characteristics has been used heavily in the recent climate-change discussion.</p> <p>Back in 1968, Fritz and his companions had left Point Barrow on February 21, and the entire crossing took 16 months. It was supplied by airdrops from the Royal Canadian Air Force that allowed them to camp for the winter on the sea ice at a location where, conveniently, the ice drift carried them steadily towards their goal. For Fritz this was more than just a headline-seeking adventure; as a glaciologist he was studying the sea ice, and the result was the first detailed, continuous survey of its thickness and characteristics.</p> <p>Born in Portsmouth, Fritz Koerner attended Portsmouth Southern grammar school, and gained a degree in geography at Sheffield University in 1954. After a brief spell as a teacher, he joined the Falkland Islands Dependency Survey (FIDS; the precursor of the British Antarctic Survey) in 1957 for two years as meteorologist at Hope Bay (now the Argentine station of Esperanza) at the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula. Like almost all FIDS personnel at that time, he learned to drive dogs, and made extensive trips across the sea ice and glaciers; thus, his passion for glaciology was born. It was there too that he first met Herbert.</p> <p>In 1961 he joined the Arctic Institute of North America's multi-disciplinary Devon Island Expedition as glaciologist. Having spent a reconnaissance season on the island's ice cap (covering roughly 3,600 square miles), he wintered at the expedition's base camp at Truelove Inlet (along with Alan Gill, who would later join him on the Transarctic Expedition), and in 1962 set out a radial network of mass-balance transects, stretching hundreds of miles and covering every corner of the ice cap. Such studies are aimed at determining the ice cap's \"budget\", whether it is growing, shrinking or stable. He would repeat most of these transects annually for more than 45 years, along with similar studies of the Agassiz ice cap on Canada's Ellesmere Island and much smaller Meighen Island ice cap in later years.</p> <p>On the basis of his mass-balance studies of another Canadian ice cap, that of Devon Island, Koerner received his PhD from the London School of Economics in 1968. While in London he met his future wife, Anna Kowalczyk, and after she returned to her native Poland, he reached a decision, got on his motorbike and rode to Warsaw, where he proposed to her. They were married in 1964. Anna accompanied Fritz and assisted him on Devon Island.</p> <p>Having joined the Institute of Polar Studies at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, in 1966-67, he was a member of a team that spent the Antarctic summer season at the remote Plateau station near the summit of the Antarctic ice sheet in Dronning Maud Land at a height of 12,000ft. Here he concentrated on snow stratigraphy, and later received the US Antarctic service medal. He was one of the few people to receive Britain's polar medal with both Arctic and Antarctic clasps.</p> <p>In 1969 he and Anna moved to Ottawa, where he joined the Polar Continental Shelf Project (PCSP), a logistics and research arm of the Canadian government, to pursue his glacier studies in the high arctic; he became head of the project's ice core laboratory, and later transferred to an identical position with the Geological Survey of Canada. </p> <p>At PCSP he made oxygen-isotope studies of ice cores, extracted from the Agassiz ice cap, the cores extending from surface down to bedrock. A study of summer-melt layers in the cores revealed summer temperatures from as far back as 11,000 years ago. It is his ice-core data that has been widely used in recent exchanges about global climatic change. </p> <p>The author of more than 70 scientific papers and chapters in books, Koerner missed only a couple of field seasons from 1961 until 2008, when he felt unwell and returned to Ottawa, where he died from colon cancer just two weeks later. From his hospital bed he consulted with his colleagues to ensure that his various research projects would continue.</p> <p>After his retirement in 1999 (although he continued his research as an emeritus scientist at the Geological Survey of Canada), Fritz escorted children on Students on Ice polar cruises. His wickedly irreverent, iconoclastic sense of humour appealed to his young audiences. In the Arctic he also took the Inuit children of Grise Fiord in southern Ellesmere Island on field trips to one of the local glaciers.</p> <p>A regular competitor in the Ottawa-Montreal ski race and keen jogger, Fritz was always very fit. Anna died in 1989 after a prolonged illness. Fritz is survived by his daughters Eva, Davina and Kristina, and son Justin. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Roy Martindale \"Fritz\" Koerner, explorer and glaciologist, born July 3 1932; died May 26 2008</p>",
  "<p>It is too soon to call an end to the oil price crisis that has engulfed global energy markets in the past year, the west's oil watchdog warned yesterday.</p> <p>World oil prices, which have fallen by more than $30 a barrel since the July peak, touched a three-month low yesterday with the International Energy Agency reporting that global oil supplies would be more than adequate to meet a slightly-higher-than-expected increase in demand next year.</p> <p>However, the IEA was cautious about whether the market had now reached a turning point. \"We would hesitate before automatically extrapolating the recent price trend,\" said the organisation. </p> <p>Within hours of the release of the IEA's sober assessment of the outlook for oil, the US Energy Information Administration said US demand had fallen by 800,000 barrels a day in the first half of the year, the largest decline for 26 years. It blamed slower economic growth and higher petrol prices. The EIA also cut its forecast for US oil demand for the third quarter, but revised it upwards for the final three months of the year.</p> <p>The Paris-based IEA had earlier said its \"all other things being equal\" forecast suggested easing fundamentals and potentially higher stocks of crude in the months to come.</p> <p>But it warned that such a scenario was threatened by a number of factors; disruption to supplies from Nigerian and Azerbaijan, storms hitting the Gulf of Mexico and potential delays to projects in Brazil, Canada and Russia.</p> <p>The threat posed by geo-political unrest to world oil supplies was underlined yesterday, when BP closed the Baku-Supsa gas pipeline which leads to the Georgian port of Supsa because of the conflict between Georgia and Russia.</p> <p>Last week the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline, which runs close to Georgia's capital Tbilisi towards the Turkish port of Ceyhan, was shut down because of an explosion unrelated to the conflict. Kurdish separatists claimed responsibility.</p> <p>The IEA said political problems could hold up Iraqi and Russian supply growth and that while the OECD demand could prove weaker than expected, inventories remained \"worryingly flat\" and demand from non-OECD countries, not least from China and the Middle East, could prove higher than expected.</p> <p>\"Add in ever-changing sentiment over Iran, and it looks too early to cite definitively a sea change in the market.\"</p> <p>The IEA said it expected global demand for oil products in 2008 to be virtually unchanged at 86.9m barrels a day and slightly higher at 87.8m barrels for 2009, on demand from outside the OECD area.</p> <p>Opec's effective spare capacity was about 1.5m barrels a day, the IEA said, but should rise later this year and into next.</p> <p>At one point yesterday US crude oil price hit its lowest level since May, at $112.48 a barrel. It then recovered to $116 but subsequently fell back to $113. Back in July it reached a peak of more than $147.</p> <p>\"Demand for Opec oil is going to be lower than its production capacity, so the market is looking forward to seeing an inventory build,\" said Olivier Jakob at trading advisory company, Petromatrix. </p> <p>Latest figures from the US showed a surprise fall in the trade deficit with a $6bn drop in non-oil imports offsetting higher energy costs.</p> <p>US commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez said the lower than expected deficit could prompt the department to raise second-quarter economic growth from its initial estimate of 1.9%. </p> <p>\"It's a very strong month for exports,\" Gutierrez said. \"The growth is coming from Brazil, it's coming from Russia, it's coming from India, it's coming from the Middle East ... It's very broad-based.\" </p> <p>The dollar rose against the euro on news the trade gap narrowed in June, but was then hit by profit taking. </p> <p>Kurt Karl, chief US economist at Swiss Re in New York, said the better than expected figures \"will support growth going into the third quarter.\" </p> <p>However, he noted the narrowing trade deficit was more evidence that the US economy could be in a recession, because it showed consumers were buying less.</p> <p>The falling oil price has brought some relief to US motorists with the price of a gallon of fuel falling below $4 for the first time since late May. The regular Lundberg survey of filling stations found the average cost of unleaded petrol has fallen by 15 cents over two weeks to $3.85. High prices have been causing soul-searching in car-dependent parts of America. </p> <p>In some areas, employers have allowed staff to compress their workload into intensive four-day weeks to reduce commuting costs. Several towns have switched police patrols onto bicycles, charities have had to cut back on meals on wheels and rail services have reported a surge in passenger numbers.</p> <p>Republicans have called for environmentally sensitive off-shore drilling to increase long-term supplies of oil - a policy which Democrats, including the presidential candidate Barack Obama, have reluctantly begun to endorse.</p> <p>The drop in oil prices, technically a bear market after a fall of 20% from the peak, has contributed to a rally on Wall Street.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The <strong>oil price </strong>more than doubled over the past year to peak at <strong>$147 </strong>a barrel in July, as producers had been unable to pump enough crude to cope with increasing demand from booming <strong>China </strong>and <strong>India</strong>. However, rising prices made it economic to boost output from large areas of marginal and highly-expensive reserves such as <strong>Canada</strong>'s<strong> </strong>tar sands. <strong>Opec</strong>, the producers' cartel, has also been pumping at its highest rate since it was created 48 years ago. But the increases in output arrived as demand from <strong>America</strong> slumped as it entered a downturn. Prices have started to fall back. Speculators who were attracted to the energy market by rising prices, have also moved elsewhere.</p>",
  "<p>A poolside row, a fusillade of flouncy inter-partner sniping, and last place in the synchronised high-board dive. This wasn't how 14-year-old darling of the pool Tom Daley's first plunge into the raw, chlorinated water of Olympic competition was supposed to end. Only two weeks ago David Beckham (\"a huge fan\") was offering to coach Daley in the rarefied business of dealing with instant fame and success. All things considered, it's probably fair to say Becks hasn't been on the blower much since Monday's Olympic dive final, in which Daley and his partner Blake Aldridge finished eighth out of eight with an unusually shaky series of leaps. </p> <p>Worse was to follow. After the competition, Aldridge let rip over the simmering tensions with his junior co-diver. \"He had a pop at me before the last dive, when we were sitting down. I saw my mum in the audience and I asked her to give me a call and Tom went to me, 'Why are you on the phone?'\" Aldridge said, coming over Vicky Pollardish in the white heat of Olympic disappointment. \"That's just Thomas - he's over-nervous and that's how it was today.\"</p> <p>In retrospect, the pairing always looked like a snipey fall-out waiting to happen. Partly this is to do with the fundamental - and, to the outsider, immediately apparent - silliness of the synchro dive, a discipline based around jumping into a swimming pool at the same time without splashing much. Then there's the troubling visual aspect of a fully grown, Speedo-clad man performing this peculiar activity with a 14-year-old boy. Plus, adding tragedy to an emotive mix, there's the fact that Aldridge's previous partner, Gavin Brown, was killed in a hit-and-run accident in April last year, after which the pairing with Daley was hastily concocted. Still, if anything can be salvaged from Aldridge's public handbagging of his partner, it is the comforting thought that the pair can now take their place in an ever-expanding roster of curious sporting double acts who have either fumed or festered while trying to put on a public smile. </p> <p>At the more successful end of things, ice-dancing pair Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean managed to keep up a successful on-rink chemistry throughout nearly 20 years of furiously intense and demanding one-on-one professional relations. With Torvill and Dean, the fascination is more about the almost bewildering absence of any kind of sexual entanglement. Most observers of their famous performance, the steamy, bat-winged routine to Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro, assumed the pair were similarly entwined off the skiddy stuff. </p> <p>Oddly, nothing of the sort ever occurred. \"Our commitment to each other was total,\" Torvill said later. \"It was a monk and a nun, both dedicated to a way of life. Sex had no part in the relationship. \"People would ask us when we were getting married, and we just found it easier to keep saying, 'Maybe next year'.\"</p> <p>Inter-partner tension seems to have centred on Dean's obsessive - and rather bossy-sounding - drive for perfection. In 1983 his ambitious plans for a \"levitation\" lift ended up with a practice attempt tearing Torvill's shoulder so badly they had to sit out the European championships. </p> <p>The world of ice-dancing has provided rather more overt drama. Most excitingly, married Russians Alexander Zhulin and Maia Usova didn't make it through the 1994 Winter Olympics after Usova caught Zhulin in an intimate clinch with another Russian dancer. Usova resolved the immediate tension by punching her rival in the face. And that was pretty much that for the pair, on ice and land. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale, Jamie Murray (brother of Andy) managed to captivate the tabloid press with his tactile and giggly pairing with the Serb Jelena Jankovic at Wimbledon last year. Competing through a fug of painfully unresolved sexual tension (more, it seemed, on the side of Murray), the pair won the mixed doubles. After which Murray issued a public invitation to her to spend Christmas with him in Scotland. \"Christmas is a long way off. We have so many things to do before then,\" Jankovic deadpanned. The pair never played together again. Murray's subsequent dissolution of his successful partnership with Eric Butorac (the pair were known as \"Booty and Stretch\") has been blamed on Booty (Butorac) struggling to deal with jealousy over Jankovic. </p> <p>There is something undeniably thrilling about those moments where the painted smile of sporting comradeship fades and we get to see the reassuringly quotidian spats and bust-ups beneath. Manchester United's striking pair Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole managed to form a brilliantly productive on-field partnership while refusing at all times to speak to one another - even during the on-field goal celebration hug - after a relatively minor falling-out some years earlier. The Charlton brothers, Bobby and Jackie, both played in England's 1966 World Cup-winning team. Off the field, the pair's relationship has been openly hostile ever since a long-distant falling out over frosty relations between Bobby's wife and their mother Cissie. </p> <p>The Charltons never went as far as Pakistani cricketers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif. A potent bowling pair on the field, Asif and Akhtar suffered a major setback in their relationship when Akhtar attacked Asif with a cricket bat during a brawl in the dressing room at the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. Cricket seems to breed this kind of thing. Earlier this year, New Zealand player Scott Styris admitted sending his recently retired former team-mate Mark Richardson a series of abusive text messages (sample quote: \"We hope you die choking on your own shit that you speak\") after Richardson had written a mildly critical article in his new role as a journalist. Styris eventually made a grumpy apology. </p> <p>In a further heartening symmetry with real life, these sporting fallings-out often tend to be based in the trivial. More often than not, it boils down to professional jealousy. In last season's formula one championship, tyro Lewis Hamilton endured a bout of no-speaks with his McLaren team-mate and reigning world champion Fernando Alonso, a feud borne out of Alonso's irritation at Hamilton's instant and unrelenting hogging of the centre stage. The pair parted company at the earliest opportunity. </p> <p>As have, to all intents and purposes, Daley and Aldridge. It's hard not to feel slightly sorry for Aldridge. Part of the delicate balancing act in any doubling-up is the stark fact that one of you, like it or not, is always going to be the star. Daley is the real talent here. He may be 14 and \"over-nervous\", but he's also the one staying on in Beijing for another shot at gold in the singles. </p> <p>As Aldridge added, rather tellingly, before slinging his damp rubber skull cap into his suitcase for the trip back to Heathrow: \"Tom's lucky that he has got another chance and I hope he takes a lot of experience from this. Unfortunately, I don't have another chance.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the battle for control of the Arctic's energy resources heats up, the US is partnering with its territorial rival Canada for a cruise to map areas of the oil-rich continental shelf.</p> <p>In addition to the Canadian cruise next month, the US state department is slated to launch a preliminary voyage tomorrow that will use echo-sounder technology to produce a 3D map of the Chukchi Cap, located about 600 miles north of Alaska.</p> <p>The two cruises by the US coast guard cutter ship Healy mark the fourth year of America's efforts to claim a share of the expansive oil reserves in the Arctic. One-fifth of the world's available and untapped fuel is located in the far north, the US government estimates.</p> <p>Data collected from the Healy's cruises will be publicly released and \"provide greater scientific insight into relatively unexplored regions of the ocean,\" the state department said this week.</p> <p>The voyages also could mark a new era of cooperation between the US and Canada, which are vying with Russia and Denmark to control parts of the Arctic seafloor. Russia's planting of a flag on the North Pole last year marked an escalation of the underwater land race.</p> <p>The Healy's findings could further enflame the politically charged debate over drilling in protected areas of the Arctic and the US coasts, depending on the data uncovered by the cruise.</p> <p>But the US-Canada cruise is primarily an alliance to aid both countries' scientific goals. Canada brings a seismic mapping system to the table hat uses sea sediments to measure the seafloor, while the Healy brings superior ice-breaking power to the venture.</p> <p>Even if the US can make a case for ownership of Arctic land beyond 200 miles off the Alaskan coast, ratification of the UN law of the sea treaty is likely necessary to formalise a claim.

The Georgians for tearing up a peace agreement and flattening the centre of an Ossetian town, or the Russians for visiting, and revisiting, similar horrors on the Georgian inhabitants of Gali in Abkhazia and Gori, in the north.</p> <p>In spite of what Georgia says, the most likely outcome of strike and counterstrike will be a return to the borders of both breakaway states, with some changes of the boundary lines. Georgia will have lost its claim over these disputed territories for good and a heavy Russian military presence will seal this territorial settlement for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>But the consequences of a short war in the Caucasus do not stop there. Successive Russian leaders, men lauded as reformers and democrats, as well as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3587717.stm\">today's generation</a> of autocrats, have warned the west about the dangers of Nato's eastward expansion. Whether it was Gorbachev with Thatcher, Yeltsin with Clinton or Putin with Bush, the message was essentially the same: push the line of confrontation eastwards and eventually Russia will push back. This is now what has happened. A sleepy and eminently vulnerable town nestling in the foothills of the Caucasus mountains has been made an object lesson of the limits of western political and military expansion.</p> <p>Russia is not concerned about the fate of breakaway regimes. By rattling Georgia's cage, Moscow is sending a message that reaches far beyond the presidential office of Mikheil Saakashvili in Tbilisi. If you are serious, Russia is saying, about extending Nato membership to Georgia or Ukraine, the price of doing that will be a major western military investment guarding these new borders. Put up or shut up.</p> <p>The Russian prescription for managing the patchwork of rival nationalities in southern Russia and amoung Russia's neighbours belongs to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck\">Bismarck</a> and is firmly rooted in the 19th century. It's about power and spheres of influence.</p> <p>But the western model which blithely assumes that every pro-western leader has almost by definition to be a democrat, also leaves something to be desired. What would happen if the events of South Ossetia were repeated in Ukraine? This is not a fanciful or malicious notion. The flood of proclamations from Moscow and Tbilisi over the last few days all but obscured one small, but significant, announcement from Kiev. In it, Ukraine warned Russia it could bar <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jiafUbbRzef5Bap4RvqbtLjfj_vgD92FC68O0\">Russian navy ships</a> from returning to their base in the Crimea because of their deployment to Georgia's coast. </p> <p>This revisits the long and bitter dispute Russia had with Ukraine over the division of the Black Sea fleet and the agreement to use Sevastopol which runs out in 2017. The Russians want to renew the base agreement and the government in Kiev does not. At issue here is not just the fate of Russia's Black Sea fleet but the identity of Crimea, a vociferously pro-Russian enclave. But it's not just Crimea. The whole industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine is pulled between a Russian and a Ukrainian identity. Even 15 years on, for a Ukrainian living in Donetsk with relatives in Moscow, the border with Russia is a nonsense. In his mind, it should not be there.</p> <p>Putin warned Nato leaders at their last conference that if Ukraine got Nato membership, it would disintegrate as a country. Was he bullying or telling the truth? Probably, a bit of both. If Ukraine became a battleground of competing 19th century nationalisms as Georgia has become, it could easily become a new Yugoslavia. Does Europe or Nato have the troops to police the new boundaries and enclaves of Ukraine that would emerge as a result? Almost definitely not.</p> <p>The counterargument to almost all of the above comes from eastern Europe and the Baltic states. For honourable reasons, and with deeply held beliefs, they argue that Nato's eastward expansion, coupled with the prospect of EU membership, is the sole guarantor of independence. To recognise that Russia sees the protection of Russian-speaking people scattered throughout the region as a casus belli is little more than appeasement, they argue. Trust us, they say. We, the victims of Soviet occupation, know the mentality of our former occupiers well. Stand up to them and they will back down. Force is the only thing Russians understand. A senior Lithuanian diplomat deployed this argument at a private seminar in London recently, three weeks before the Georgian crisis blew up. All Europe needed to do, he said, was to put a token police force in Abkhazia and the Russians would back off. Would he still be saying that now, I wonder?</p> <p>The eastern European model for dealing with a resurgent nationalist Russia has worked for them, although all states are vulnerable to cuts in the Russian oil and gas supply. But that model, I argue, is a recipe for war and disintegration in the former Soviet space. Not because it is Russia's backyard, but because it is Russia's breaker's yard.</p> <p>The fear that lurked in Russian minds when Kosovo's independence was recognised by many European governments, had nothing to do with the Kosovo Albanians or the Serbs, for whom Russia's leaders care little. It had to do with the thought of what would happen to the Russian Federation if Tartars or any other ethnic minorities (of which there are hundreds) did the same. Russia's show of strength in Georgia is the surest indicator of Russia's territorial vulnerability. </p> <p>The west's response to the Georgian crisis should not be to re-erect fresh lines of confrontation through the middle of Ukraine, or along the Caucasus mountain range. It should not be to install \"pipeline police\" guarding the oil pipeline from Baku. It should not be to establish major military bases along that new border: the proposed US missile defence radar in the Czech Republic has a strategic military significance far beyond the reach of the host nation. It should be to localise conflicts, blur divisions, share control of strategic military resources, and keep borders open.</p> <p>This is not appeasement, nor even realpolitik, nor even an abandonment of democratic principles. On the contrary, every time events follow the mindset of the hawks in the Kremlin, Russia's dwindling band of democrats gets smaller still and the possibility of regime change in Moscow is set back another generation. The surest way of keeping hawks in the Kremlin is to keep advancing eastwards. It is a recipe for war, which Europe has no will to fight.</p>",
  "<p>In the conflict in the Caucasus, Russia has plenty of tanks, troops and planes. Georgia has a small army and Mikhail Saakashvili, its voluble and media-friendly president.</p> <p>Saakashvili has waged a one-man battle for public opinion, popping up daily on TV screens as if his words can make a difference against the might of the Russian army. The appearances are short but never fail to yield a sound bite for the world's media.</p> <p>Today, the American-educated Saakashvili sounded almost Churchillian. No matter how much Russia tries to undermine us, he said, we will never surrender. His rhetoric was even starker yesterday when he accused Russia of trying to \"murder a small country\". </p> <p>As if to reinforce the image of \"plucky Georgia\" fighting against the odds, there have been TV images of the Georgian president, wearing a flak jacket, bundled away by his security guards during a visit to Gori as Russian aircraft buzzed overhead.</p> <p>After Russia retaliated with great force to Georgia's sally into South Ossetia last Thursday, Saakashvili has sought to portray the conflict in the most apocalyptic terms, depicting the Georgians as the victims of a resurgent Russia intent on crushing nascent democracies on its border. The doom-and-gloom rhetoric is designed to win world sympathy in a conflict where there is a total mismatch between the Russian and Georgian armed forces.</p> <p>The dashing Saakashvili certainly cuts a more sympathetic figure than the dour Vladimir Putin, the Russian prime minister, or his sidekick, the nondescript president Dmitry Medvedev. Saakashvili's one-man campaign has been effective to a point. His frequent appearances keep Georgia in the news and his statements helps to put his country in the best possible light.</p> <p>His reward has been sympathetic words of support from the US, the EU and Nato. But the west has little to offer other than statements of support for Georgia coupled with denunciations of Russian ruthlessness. The US is on the sidelines, leaving the EU and its current president, the energetic Nicolas Sarkozy, to make the diplomatic running.</p> <p>It is fitting that Saaskashvili has led the propaganda battle as it was his decision to take back the breakaway province of South Ossetia that precipitated the crisis that could spell the return of Georgia to Russian control.</p> <p>So far, Georgians have rallied in support of their leader in the face of the Russian onslaught, but once the dust has settled, they might well decide that having a man all too ready to take risks on their behalf is not such a good idea. Moreover, despite his self-portrait as a democrat, Saaskashvili, who succeeded Eduard Shevardnadze in the so-called rose revolution in 2003, has an authoritarian streak.</p> <p>Although Saakashvili and his small circle of young advisers have won kudos for battling corruption in Georgia and boosting the economy, political opponents have been thrown into jail under his presidency. Last year, he surprised his American backers by declaring a 15-day state of emergency after battles between riot police and demonstrators protesting against the postponement of parliamentary elections. Those critics are quiet for now. But once the crisis subsides, it should come as no surprise if the knives come out once more following Saakashvilis's misadventure in South Ossetia.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's hopes of converting the bronze position they held after the cross country into silver or gold during the final show jumping discipline of the three-day event were always based more on optimism than reality, and they duly had to settle for what will be viewed as a disappointing team bronze behind Germany, who won the gold, and the Australian silver medal winners. However, there was better news for the British later on, when Kristina Cook claimed bronze in the individual event, behind Germany's Hinrich Romeike and American Gina Miles.</p> <p>The Germans were understandably elated. Four years ago in Athens, on an evening of sustained chaos, Germany's Bettina Hoy rode a seemingly flawless round, only to be penalised for crossing the starting line twice. An appeal rescinded that penalty, and Hoy left Athens with both the team and individual gold medals. Then, three days later, the Court for Arbitration in Sport overturned Germany's appeal, leaving both Hoy and her team-mates without any medals whatsoever. To say they were on a mission here would be something of an understatement.</p> <p>Britain had benefited from the ruling, with their team being upgraded from bronze to silver, and Leslie Law winning an unlikely individual gold. But there were no such dramas here. The Germans and the Australians rode quite beautifully, leaving Britain with no chance of closing the gap. This left them with the necessity of protecting the bronze medal against any challenge from Italy, and this they managed comfortably enough with Cook's clear round on Miners Frolic making doubly sure before the Italians self-imploded anyway.</p> <p>However, Britain had arrived here with high hopes of winning their first team gold since the 1972 Munich Games when Richard Meade established himself as one of the all-time great Olympians, winning team and individual gold to add to his team gold in Mexico City four years earlier. To this extent their pleasure at winning a medal was understandably diluted.</p> <p>The absence of Zara Phillips, the reigning world champion, contributed to Britain's less than scintillating showing, her horse Toytown being ruled out earlier this summer when the gelding went lame. Neither did the five British riders perform well in the opening dressage section, and after Sunday's cross-country Germany and Australia already had more than half grip on the gold and silver respectively.</p> <p>Yogi Breisner, the British team manager, had continued to remain optimistic, citing Athens as a night when the impossible became possible. That was never really likely on this occasion, and he and the team knew it.</p>",

  "<h2>Why has fighting broken out?</h2> <p>The South Ossetians and Georgians have been sniping at each other for several weeks, and patience on both sides has finally snapped. Along with Georgia's other breakaway region, Abkhazia, South Ossetia has enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s, but Tbilisi has never recognised the loss of its territory. The dispute between Georgia and the two regions was called \"the frozen conflict\" because the issues remain unresolved, but there was no fighting. The heat began to rise this year when the west recognised Kosovo, against Russia's advice. The South Ossetians and Abkhazians argued that if Kosovo could be independent, then so could they.</p> <h2>What is the basis of the region's claim to independence?</h2> <p>The Ossetians are descendants of a tribe called the Alans. Like the Georgians, the Ossetians are Orthodox Christians, but they have their own language. In Soviet times, the Ossetians had an autonomous region within Georgia. The Georgians say the Ossetians cooperated with the Bolsheviks and tended to be more pro-Soviet. Their ethnic kin live across the border in the Russian region of North Ossetia, so today they feel more drawn to Russia than to Georgia, and many have Russian passports.</p> <p>Abkhazia, on the Black Sea coast, was also an autonomous region of Georgia in Soviet times. It has a mixed population of Abkhaz, Mingrelians, Greeks, Armenians, Russians and Georgians, and a small but significant Muslim minority. Thousands of ethnic Georgians fled their homes in Abkhazia during the civil war in the early 90s and now live as refugees in Tbilisi and Moscow.</p> <h2>Why did Georgia attack in South Ossetia?</h2> <p>On Thursday, Georgian forces launched a surprise attack and briefly took the South Osssetian capital, Tskhinvali. Georgia said it had made the assault in order to stop separatist fighters attacking civilians. The attack followed months of what Georgia described as Russian provocation, including the firing of Russian missiles at Georgian territory. Russia also cut off air service and mail between the two countries, and refused Georgian exports. </p> <p>Georgia may have hoped that with Vladimir Putin, the prime minister, away in Beijing, it could successfully reassert control of Ossetia with a minimum of fuss. If so, it was a colossal miscalculation: the Russians retaliated with massive force and the tiny Georgian army was soon forced to pull back from South Ossetia as Russian forces pressed home their advantage to penetrate Georgia proper.</p> <p>Russia says it has stopped all operations, but there are still reports of military activity.</p> <h2>Why did Russia react so strongly?</h2> <p>Russia says it cannot stand aside because many of the people in the breakaway regions are its citizens. Resorting to apocalyptic rhetoric, Russia has accused Georgia of committing genocide, drawing comparisons with Srebrenica, in the former Yugoslavia, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred by Serbs during the Bosnia war. </p> <p>Georgia, for its part, accuses Russia of meddling in its internal affairs and supporting the separatists, although Russia's peacekeepers are supposed to be in a neutral role. Georgia also accuses Russia of double standards in brutally suppressing its own separatist rebellion in Chechnya while encouraging separatists in Georgia. </p> <h2>What does Russia want?</h2> <p>In the short term, Russia has made no secret of its desire for \"regime change\". Moscow wants a more pliant leader in Tblisi than the US-educated Mikhail Saaskhasvili, America's staunchest ally in the region, who is determined to take Georgia into Nato. He also came into office pledging to reassert control over Georgia's breakaway provinces. More generally, Russia is sending a signal to its neighbours \u2013 which include Ukraine \u2013 that they are still within the Russian sphere of influence, and that there are clear limits to their rapprochement with the west. The line in the sand for Russia is that it does not want Nato in its back yard. Russia has been equally vociferous in resisting the stationing of parts of a US missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p> <h2>What are the wider implications?</h2> <p>The short war has highlighted US impotence in the region, despite its strong verbal support for Georgia. The EU -and particularly the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy - has taken the diplomatic lead, leaving the Americans on the sidelines. Meanwhile, Russia has forcefully made the point that it is not to be trifled with in its own backyard. More broadly, South Ossetia highlights the fact that the world community cannot agree on rules governing the independence of small regions.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336490041\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p><br>Georgia today said it would never allow the country \"to be broken up into pieces\" and accused Russian forces of continuing their offensive after Moscow claimed to have stopped the advance.</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikhail Saakhashvili, said he would regard Russian troops in the breakaway states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as occupying forces.</p> <p>He claimed Russia had been preparing for the crisis in the Caucasus for at least a year, and said its troops and supporters had been deliberately targeting police in an effort to destabilise his country.</p> <p>US-educated and west-leaning Saakhashvili said Georgia would be leaving the Russia-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States, the organisation representing former Soviet bloc countries. </p> <p>\"Those people who are bombing us want to restore the Soviet Union,\" he told reporters in Tbilisi, but the people of Georgia did not want to return to the past and would \"never surrender\".</p> <p>But Russia denied that its forces were still fighting and said Georgia's claims were provocative. </p> <p>Meanwhile French president Nicola Sarkozy, visiting Moscow to try to broker a peace deal, said: \"We are not at peace yet but we are at a stage of temporary cessation of hostilities, which is certainly significant.\"</p> <p>\"The night is young,\" he added, after conceding there is still a lot of work to do.</p> <p>However, his Russian counterpart Dimtry Medvedev had told him Russia had no intention of staying in Georgia.</p> <p>Nato also insisted that Russia's halting military action was an important first step, but said Russian and Georgian troops must return to positions they held before fighting started last week.</p> <p><br>Georgia said it remained \"prepared for everything\" until there was more evidence of a halt to operations. Thousands of supporters, holding red and white Georgian flags, packed a rally to hear further defiance from their president.</p> <p>Before Russia said it had ceased military action, at least five civilians were killed in Gori, which was bombarded by airstrikes, although the Russian general staff denied it was being targeted.</p> <p>Reports from the scene suggested explosions may have been caused by mortar fire and not by bombs dropped by jets, as witnesses first thought.<br>The villages of Ruisi and Sakoringo, well outside South Ossetia where the five-day conflict first flared, had also been hit after the supposed cessation of hostilities, according to Tbilisi.</p> <p>There were also separate reports today of witnesses seeing 135 military vehicles driving through Georgia towards the other separatist province of Abkhazia.</p> <p>The Georgian prime minister, Lado Gurgenidze, speaking to Reuters news agency, said, \"We will need more evidence, everyone in this situation needs a binding agreement. Until that happens, we are mobilised, we are prepared for everything.\" Despite the Russian gesture he said \"there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today\".</p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, who had ordered an end to the fighting, said a full settlement of the conflict could only be reached if Georgian troops returned to their initial positions, were \"partly demilitarised\", and there was \"a binding agreement on the non-use of force\".</p> <p>Earlier, Sarkozy had called for a rapid timetable to be established for each side to go back to positions they held before the crisis. The sovereignty, integrity and security of Georgia must be preserved, he said.</p> <p>Speaking on national television, Medvedev had said Russian forces had punished Georgia and restored security for Russian peacekeepers and civilians in the separatist South Ossetia region.</p> <p>\"The aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses,\" he said. \"Its military has been disorganised.\"</p> <p>Soon afterwards, Russian military officials confirmed that forces would remain where they were until there was a reaction from the Georgian government in Tbilisi.</p> <p>Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn said they would retaliate against any \"provocation\".</p> <p>Denis Keefe, the British ambassador to Georgia, told BBC television: \"If this news that military operations are stopping is correct, then it is what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace.</p> <p>\"This is a beautiful place with a wonderful people.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2008/aug/11/endangeredspecies.wildlife?picture=336356668\">Britain's honeybees</a> have suffered catastrophic losses this year, according to a survey of the nation's beekeepers, contributing to a shortage of honey and putting at risk the pollination of fruits and vegetables.</p> <p>The survey by the <a href=\"http://www.britishbee.org.uk/\">British Beekeepers' Association</a> (BBKA) revealed that nearly one in three of the UK's 240,000 honeybee hives did not survive this winter and spring.</p> <p>The losses are higher than the one in five colonies reported dead earlier this year by the government after 10% of hives had been inspected. </p> <p>The BBKA president, Tim Lovett, said he was very concerned about the findings: \"Average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5% and 10%, so a 30% loss is deeply worrying. This spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers.\"</p> <p><br>The <a href=\"https://secure.csl.gov.uk/beebase/\">National Bee Unit</a> has attributed high bee mortality to the wet summer in 2007 and in the early part of this spring that confined bees to their hives. This meant they were unable to forage for nectar and pollen and this stress provided the opportunity for pathogens to build up and spread.</p> <p>But the BBKA says the causes are unclear. Its initial survey of 600 members revealed a marked north-south divide, with 37% bee losses in the north, compared to 26% in the south. \"We don't know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality,\" said Lovett.</p> <p>The government recognises that the UK's honeybee hives - run by 44,000 mostly amateur beekeepers - contribute around \u00a3165m a year to the economy by pollinating many fruits and vegetables. \"30% fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some \u00a350m and put at risk the government's crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day,\" Lovett warned.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/54440/No-British-honey-by-Christmas-as-bees-suffer\">Honey Association</a> warned last month that English honey will run out by Christmas and no more will be available until summer 2009. It blames the shortage on fewer honeybees and farmers devoting more fields to wheat, which has soared in price but does not produce nectar.</p> <p>The UK's leading honey company is so concerned by the crisis that it has pledged to donate money to honeybee research. From next month, for each jar of Rowse English honey sold in supermarkets 10p will be donated to a fund dedicated to improving the health of the nation's honeybees.</p> <p>Stuart Bailey, chairman of Rowse Honey said: \"We are working with the UK Bee Farmers' Association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of \u00a325,000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases.\" </p> <p>Rowse's clear English honey comes mainly from the borage plant, also known as starflower, which has been grown increasingly as a source of a fatty acid rich in omega-6 for pharmaceutical products. But farmers have planted much less borage this year as ready-processed borage oil is being imported and wheat is more profitable to grow due to the increase in demand for biofuels.</p> <p>Bailey added that the shortage had been exacerbated by an 11% rise in demand for English honey over the last year. </p> <p>Although British honey only accounts for 10% of the 30,000 tonnes of honey consumed in the UK, other major honey producing countries have also been severely hit by poor weather and bee diseases. Argentina is the world's honey pot, producing up to 75,000 tonnes a year - three times that of its nearest rival Mexico. But Argentina has suffered a 27% drop in yield due to droughts and the planting of huge swathes of land with soya beans for biofuel. As a result, there has been a 60% rise in the price of raw honey.</p> <p>In the US, honey yields have been decimated by honeybee loses of 36%, many due to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/08/wildlife.endangeredspecies\">colony collapse disorder</a> (CCD), a mysterious disappearance linked to the blood-sucking varroa mite, lethal viruses, malnutrition, pesticides, and a lack of genetic diversity. CCD has spread to Canada, France, Germany and Italy but has not yet been confirmed by government in the Britain.</p> <p>The BBKA is calling on the the UK government to put \u00a38m over five years into researching honeybee losses and improving bee health.</p> <p>Farming minister, Lord Rooker, has predicted the demise of the honeybee within a decade. Last November, he told parliament: \"We do not deny that honeybee health is at risk. Frankly, if nothing is done about it, the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years.\"</p> <p>Yet the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/\">Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> (Defra) spends just \u00a31.3m on bee health each year- less than one per cent of the bees' value to the economy - with an additional \u00a3200,000 for research.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/\">National Farmer's Union</a> said it was essential for government to increase its funding of honeybee research. \"Research is vital into varroa, bee breeding and the Nosema parasite,\" said Chris Hartfield, NFU horticultural adviser. \"We are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk.\"</p> <p>Defra said a further \u00a390,000 had been allocated to the NBU this year to expand investigations into colony losses. It is currently consulting on a honeybee health strategy, with responses required by the end of this month. </p> <p>A Defra spokesman said: \"Significant public funds are already provided to support this area of work but to ensure this intervention is effective, it it vital that work is driven by a well thought out strategy agreed by all relevant parties.\"</p>",

It orbits at a distance of 148,000 miles from the centre of the gas giant, taking 32.9 hours for each revolution. </p> <p>Despite travelling at an impressive 40,000 miles per hour, Cassini still had time during its pass to take a few snaps. <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/image-details.cfm?imageID=3013\">Nasa scientists are particularly interested in the thermal tiger stripes on the moon's south pole</a> where geysers of water-ice and vapour stream out of fissures into <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_938.html\">Saturn's E-ring</a>. Temperatures at the pole can fall below -201C while the stripes indicate temperatures rising to a relatively relatively cosy -93C.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/cassini-aug08.blog/posts/post_1218483547731.html\">Dr Bonnie Buratti at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena said that one \"hot topic\" was the presence of organic material on Enceladus:</a> </p> <blockquote> <p>The moon is almost pure water ice, but we think we found some light organics during our previous flybys. 'Organics' are materials composed of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, the building blocks of life. With liquid water and the presence of organic material, the conditions on Enceladus may be similar to those in the oceans where life arose on the young Earth.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20080811.html\">data reached Earth shortly after 05.00 (BST) this morning</a>. \"Over the next few days and weeks, the Cassini teams will be analysing the photos and other data to tease out new clues about this tiny, active world,\" said Dr Bob Pappalardo, also at JPL. </p> <p>Cassini is scheduled to make two more flybys in October, passing as close as 16 miles from the surface. </p> <p><a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/image-details.cfm?imageID=3166\">Nasa has a map of Enceladus on its website</a> as well as a collection of recent (and rather grainy) <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/raw-images-list1.html\">raw images from the Cassini-Huygens flyby</a>.

Thousands of supporters, holding red and white Georgian flags, packed a rally to hear further defiance from their president, Mikhail Saakashvili.</p> <p>Before Russia said it had ceased military action, at least five civilians were killed in Gori, which was bombarded by airstrikes, although the Russian general staff denied it was being targeted.</p> <p>Reports from the scene suggested explosions may have been caused by mortar fire and not by bombs dropped by jets, as witnesses first thought.</p> <p>The villages of Ruisi and Sakoringo, well outside South Ossetia where the five-day conflict first flared, had been hit after the supposed cessation of hostilities, according to Tbilisi.</p> <p>There were also separate reports today of witnesses seeing 135 military vehicles driving through Georgia towards the other separatist province of Abkhazia.</p> <p><br>The Georgian prime minister, Lado Gurgenidze, speaking to Reuters news agency, said, \"We will need more evidence, everyone in this situation needs a binding agreement. Until that happens, we are mobilised, we are prepared for everything.\" Despite the Russian gesture he said \"there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today\".</p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, who had ordered an end to the fighting, said a full settlement of the conflict could only be reached if Georgian troops returned to their initial positions, were \"partly demilitarised\", and there was \"a binding agreement on the non-use of force\".</p> <p>French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who is meeting Medvedev today, welcomed Russia's announcement of a halt to the fighting but said a full ceasefire now had to take shape. </p> <p>He called for a rapid timetable to be established for each side to go back to positions they held before the crisis. The sovereignty, integrity and security of Georgia must be preserved, he said.</p> <p>Speaking on national television, Medvedev had said Russian forces had punished Georgia and restored security for Russian peacekeepers and civilians in the separatist South Ossetia region.</p> <p>\"The aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses,\" he said. \"Its military has been disorganised.\"</p> <p>Soon afterwards, Russian military officials confirmed that forces would remain where they were until there was a reaction from the Georgian government in Tbilisi.</p> <p>Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn said they would retaliate against any \"provocation\".</p> <p>Denis Keefe, the British ambassador to Georgia, told BBC television: \"If this news that military operations are stopping is correct, then it is what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace.</p> <p>\"This is a beautiful place with a wonderful people.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> today accused the government of bringing the housing market to a standstill with a \"completely reckless\" briefing about stamp duty.</p> <p>At one of his <a href=\" http://blogs.theguardian.com/politics/2008/08/david_cameron_press_conference.html\">regular press conferences</a> in London the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservative</a> leader told journalists: \"When it comes to the crisis in our housing market they seem intent on making things worse rather than better. </p> <p>\"Their decision to brief out the possibility of a stamp duty holiday was completely reckless.</p> <p>\"Far from bringing up the housing market they've actually frozen it and this tells you everything you need to know about the government: press handling and headlines above what is in the best interests of the country.\"</p> <p>Cameron called the press conference on his return from his holiday in Devon. He has got political engagements this week before resuming his summer break with a holiday in Turkey next week. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> is still on holiday in Scotland.</p> <p>Cameron was speaking ahead of a meeting later today with the National Association of Estate Agents, which has complained that some people have pulled out of property purchases because they want to see what happens to stamp duty in the autumn.</p> <p>Last week a report in the Sun said that the government would abolish stamp duty temporarily later this year in a bid to kick-start the housing market. <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a>, the chancellor, would not confirm the story when he was asked about it in an interview the same day, but he hinted that he was considering changes to the stamp duty regime.</p> <p>The following day many newspapers reported \u2013 on the basis of Whitehall and ministerial briefings \u2013 that Darling was considering deferring stamp duty on purchases worth up to \u00a3250,000. Buyers would still have to pay, but not at the point when they bought a house.</p> <p>Cameron said that his party would hold a seminar on housing policy later today. It will be attended by economists, academics, housebuilders and other experts and it will help inform Tory policy-making.</p> <p>\"We won't be announcing any conclusions today. We won't be briefing our thoughts today. This is a seminar to look at the issues \u2013 it's to engage with the experts to help us develop our policies,\" he said.</p> <p>Cameron also claimed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/12/inflation.creditcrunch\">today's inflation figures</a>, which showed inflation rose to 4.4% in July, were \"yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet\". </p> <p>He went on: \"The most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy. </p> <p>\"Hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them, businesses are cutting back, unemployment is creeping up and this morning's inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet.\" </p> <p>Cameron said the latest rise showed Gordon Brown, as both chancellor and prime minister, \"has not been that effective\". </p> <p>\"After everything we've heard from the prime minister about his fantastic economic record, RPI inflation is 5% today, it was 2.6% in 1997, and CPI is 4.4% today and it was 1.6% in 1997. </p> <p>\"That is not a good record and people are beginning to see that this decade of this chancellor now prime minister's conduct has not been that effective.\" </p> <p>Later, asked about Cameron's comments about stamp duty, Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told the World at One: \"There's a lot of nonsense talked about this. There is always a lot of speculation about taxes. As you well know, ministers do not comment on taxes.\"</p> <p>On the subject of inflation, Cooper acknowledged that price rises were causing problems for people. But she said the government had already cut taxes this year by around \u00a34bn \"to help support the economy at a difficult time\".</p> <p>At his news conference, Cameron also urged the government to adopt a tougher stance towards Russia over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/russia.georgia\">crisis in Georgia</a>.</p> <p>He said the government should consider imposing tougher visa restrictions on Russian nationals travelling to the UK, particularly those associated with the current crisis, and suspension of Russia's membership of the G8. </p> <p>He also suggested that Britain should press for negotiations on an EU-Russia strategic partnership to be suspended and called for an urgent meeting of Nato foreign ministers to discuss Georgia's \"pathway\" to membership of the alliance. </p> <p>\"History has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked, you only store up graver problems for the future,\" Cameron said.</p>",

  "<p><br>Terence Rigby as Pozzo, with Richard Dormer as Lucky, in Peter Hall's 'near-definitive' production of Waiting for Godot. Photograph: Anna Arthur</p> <p>I had a small walk-on part in the life of the actor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/12/television.television\">Terence Rigby</a>, whose death, sadly, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/12/television.television1\">announced yesterday</a>. </p> <p>Back in the 1990s Rigby, who had built up a seductive practice in British theatre and television, suddenly decided to relocate to New York. But his initial application for the green card required by American Equity was turned down because he was too close to his referees: people like Peter Hall and John Gielgud. So, out of the blue, Rigby wrote to myself and Bernard Levin asking us to endorse his application. Whatever we said must have done the trick, since Rigby spent his last decade happily commuting between the US and the UK where the work offers still came in.</p> <p>Why did Rigby suddenly decide to go west? Meeting him five years ago, when he was rehearsing Pinter's Davies in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/aug/26/theatre\">The Caretaker for Bristol Old Vic</a>, I deduced it had a lot to do with his background. Rigby came from the Birmingham suburb of Erdington where his dad ran a two-man firm making hydraulic packings. I had a great-aunt who also came from Erdington and, from my childhood memories, it was a place you'd want to get out of. And you can see how a Brummagem boy, with a love of acting, would have entertained fantasies of the bright lights of Broadway.</p> <p>In reality, Broadway is a bit more like a grotty Birmingham suburb than we care to admit. And Rigby was honest enough to confess that his early years in New York were a struggle. He lived for a while in the apartment of a partying Puerto Rican family with a fire station underneath and a night-club next door. Eventually Rigby got his own tiny New York studio but, even when off-Broadway work came in, life was still tough: he told me that he earned a meagre $286 a week playing in <a href=\"http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&amp;tols_title=SMELLING%20A%20RAT%20(PLAY)&amp;pdate=20020521&amp;byline=By%20BEN%20BRANTLEY&amp;id=1077011431472\">Mike Leigh's Smelling a Rat</a>. But Rigby was sustained by occasional movie work, the loyalty of old mates such as Hall and Pinter, and by his own immigrant version of the American dream.</p> <p>What Rigby's curious career conceals is that he had a vital quality as an actor: physical and emotional weight. It was this that enabled him to play the thuggish Briggs in Pinter's No Man's Land, Stalin in Robert Bolt's State of Revolution, and the bullying Pozzo in Peter Hall's most recent, and near-definitive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/26/theatre\">Waiting for Godot</a>. \"Weight\" is a hard quality to define: Timothy West has it, as did the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/24/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Leo McKern</a>. But what is fascinating about Rigby is that he possessed it from the start, which is why he was a natural for TV cops in series like Z-Cars and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129717/\">Softly Softly</a>, and why he was so brilliant as the boxer, Joey, in Pinter's The Homecoming.</p> <p>I suspect that kind of weight is becoming increasingly rare for a simple reason: because of the abolition of mandatory student grants, fewer working or lower middle class actors can afford to go to drama school. What chance would a young Albert Finney, son of a Salford bookie, have today? Or indeed a young Rigby with his small-businessman background?</p> <p>Obviously there are a lot of good young actors about; but I know, from the begging letters I receive, that many are prevented from pursuing a theatrical career by lack of parental income. So we should celebrate Terence Rigby not only as a fine actor, but as an example of a fast-disappearing breed.</p>",
  "<p>A leading al-Qaida military commander has been killed during several days of fierce fighting in north-west Pakistan, clashes that are pushing the country towards open war with the extremists. </p> <p>Insurgents blew up a bus carrying air force personnel today just outside Peshawar, the capital of the North West Frontier province. The powerful blast killed 14 people and injured 10 more, and left a five-metre crater in the road. </p> <p>According to a Pakistani security official, fighting in the Bajaur region has resulted in the death of militant Abu Saeed al-Masri, identified in local media reports as Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, al-Qaida's commander in Afghanistan. Yazid claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Danish embassy in Islamabad earlier this year, and he has also been linked to the assassination of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in December. </p> <p>A second key al-Qaida figure, Abu Khabab al-Masri - an alleged chemical and biological weapons expert - was killed last month in a US air strike in South Waziristan, another part of Pakistan's tribal area. The presence of Yazid and Masri in Pakistan will fuel claims that the Taliban insurrection in Afghanistan is being directed from Pakistani territory and that the country is being used by al-Qaida as its global operations centre. </p> <p>Bajaur is a hotbed of militancy, run by the Pakistani Taliban number two, Faqir Mohammed. It is thought to be a possible hiding place for al-Qaida's leaders, Ayman al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden. Yazid was an Egyptian who served time in jail with Zawahri after the assassination of the Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. He has been referred to as al-Qaida's third most senior figure, rising up the ranks as other leaders have been killed. He succeeded Abu Ubaida al-Masri, who died of hepatitis, about a year ago. The September 11 Commission described Yazid as the network's \"chief financial manager\" and he may have wired money to the 9/11 hijackers. </p> <p>He recently gave a rare interview to Pakistan's Geo channel, in which he said that \"all Americans are our enemy now, not just the American government\". </p> <p>While attention in Islamabad is firmly fixed on the political drama surrounding the impeachment of President Pervez Musharraf, violence in north-west Pakistan is escalating, leaving the government's stated policy of holding peace talks with militants in tatters. </p> <p>Over the past week fighting has erupted in the Bajaur and Kurram areas along the Afghan border and in the Swat valley in North West Frontier province. </p> <p>In Kurram the fighting has an inter-tribal and sectarian nature that the Taliban is exploiting. The area has a significant Shia population that is threatened by the insurgents, who come from Islam's majority Sunnis. The violence has escalated in recent days but it has been ongoing for the last year. Tribesmen have repeatedly complained that the Pakistani security forces fail to come to their aid, and thousands of local people have fled the tribal territoryinto North West Frontier province (NWFP). </p> <p>Separately, the NWFP provincial parliament passed a near-unanimous vote in favour of impeaching President Musharraf today. The vote, by 107 to four, reveals a complete collapse in support for the president, with even the party led by his former interior minister, Aftab Sherpao, voting against him. The assembly in Punjab province also delivered an overwhelming vote against Mr Musharraf yesterday, in which many of his allies also deserted him. </p> <p>Sherry Rehman, the federal government's information minister, said she expected the impeachment resolution to be moved in the national parliament next week. \"A tidal wave is moving against General Musharraf,\" she said .</p>",

Inchcolm Island</h2> <p>A sliver of land in the middle of the Firth of Forth, Inchcolm Island has been of strategic importance since Roman times right up until the second world war, when it was fortified in the event of an attack on Edinburgh. Visited by St Columba in the sixth century, it's now home to an impressive abbey \u2013 hence it is known as the Iona of the east. Great views of Edinburgh from the beach. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Catch the Maid of Forth ferry from South Queensferry. The trips are three hours in duration, with one and a half hours on shore. Adult \u00a310, child \u00a33.50</p> <h2>3. Hopetoun House</h2> <p>Set in 150 acres of parkland and woodland, with its own deer park, Hopetoun House is one of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in the UK.

Founded in the town in 1908, it's one of many established in the country by Italian immigrants and, to this day, it remains a family business.</p> <h2>10. Glasgow</h2> <p>Sacrilegious though it sounds, a visit to Edinburgh's grittier sister city takes only 50 minutes by train and counts, during festival time anyway, as an oasis of calm with nary a stilt walker, desperate student theatre company or mime artist to be seen. Although there may be the occasional busker on Buchanan Street, known for its shopping, or in the caf\u00e9-dotted streets of the Merchant City, Glasgow could nevertheless provide welcome respite from the crowds of Edinburgh.

  "<p>\"We will never share our homeland and Jerusalem with anyone else.\" So said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/08/thelanguageofwar\">Nadia Matar</a>, de facto shepherd of her flock of acolytes as they marched around the walls of Jerusalem's Old City on Saturday night to commemorate <a href=\"http://wujs.org.il/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=346&amp;Itemid=232\">Tisha Ba'av</a>, the saddest day in the Jewish calendar. </p> <p>Orthodox Jews traditionally mark the occasion by adopting an air of mourning, reading the <a href=\"http://www.ou.org/yerushalayim/tishabav/eicha.html\">Book of Lamentations</a>, fasting and quietly remembering all of the tragedies that have befallen the Jewish people throughout history. However, in the twisted world of Matar and her supporters, the best way to deal with the pain of our historical suffering is to take out our anger on others, namely the Palestinians, in an annual show of force infused with hardline nationalism. </p> <p>Several hundred marchers gathered in the courtyard of the Jerusalem Municipality headquarters on the edge of the Old City, eagerly awaiting Nadia's orders to begin their parade. Despite the unabashedly sectarian nature of the march \u2013 \"The land of Israel for the people of Israel\" was emblazoned across dozens of flags and banners \u2013 the authorities seemingly had no issue with the event taking place. Neither, apparently, did any opposition group \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/24/thesilentmajority\">as I reported last year</a>, the demonstration goes unchallenged by counter-protest.</p> <p>The authorities had even cleared the streets of Palestinians, laying on scores of heavily armed policemen to protect the marchers as they strode defiantly into the heart of East Jerusalem. No matter to them the message of hate being preached by Matar over the microphone; nor the parrot-like cries of her disciples as they repeatedly jeered \"Jerusalem is ours\" to the silent Palestinians watching from behind the police lines.</p> <p>The authorities decided, in their wisdom, to turn a similarly blind eye to the incitement spouted by the raft of speakers who addressed the adoring crowd in front of the aptly-named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions'_Gate\">Lion's Gate</a>. Roaring their righteous anger and whipping the crowd into a nationalistic fervour, they assured their audience that it was the Jews' divine right to take whatever they wanted from whoever they wanted, in order to hasten the coming of the Messiah and the building of the Third Temple. \"It's all ours,\" one man proclaimed into the microphone, to thunderous applause, \"so why should we be scared to say it?\"</p> <p>When the Second Temple was razed by the Romans, the prophet Jeremiah lamented the fall of Jerusalem, describing the defeated city as \"destroyed, and without inhabitants\". The triumph of having retaken Jerusalem by force almost 2,000 years later is, to many orthodox Jews, reason not to fast on Tisha Ba'av, since the city is no longer in the ruinous state as described by Jeremiah \u2013 at least, not from a Jewish perspective. </p> <p>To Nadia Matar, as well as those trailing reverentially in her wake around the Old City walls, the Jewish perspective is the only one that matters, hence her complete inability to see how the Jews' tortured history is repeating itself today, albeit in mirror-image form. The parallels between Palestinian residents of Jerusalem being discriminated against and persecuted by the Israeli authorities and the ignominy suffered by Jews throughout the ages are as clear as day, yet don't make the slightest impression on those for whom Jewish dominion over Greater Israel is everything. </p> <p>When Nadia Matar boasted into the camera that \"we won't share our homeland and Jerusalem with anyone else\", she epitomised all that is so tragic about religious Zionism, the bastard child born of Judaism's illicit union with rampant nationalism. Instead of using the occasion of Tisha Ba'av for quiet contemplation and solemn reflection on the universal aspect of suffering, those marching round Jerusalem loudly declared their intent to focus simply on reminding the world that the Jews are back, and woe betide anyone who stands in their way. </p> <p>That alone should be reason to continue mourning the fate of the Jewish people, despite our having returned to our ancestral home and having dominion over Jerusalem once more. We might think we've been freed from the yoke of oppression, but in truth it's still with us; it just happens that we've shackled it to someone else's necks, rather than they to ours. </p> <p>In a sermon in London yesterday, Rabbi Michael Pollak asked how \u2013 given that Anglo Jewry enjoys a richer, more pampered lifestyle than any other Jewish community throughout history \u2013 Jews could truly understand what suffering feels like. His answer was that one way modern Jews can discover the pain of <em>aveilut</em> (mourning) is through empathising with the suffering of others, past and present, Jewish and non-Jewish. </p> <p>Part of the Jewish experience has been, sadly, to suffer great losses and hardships throughout the ages, but one positive aspect of such anguish is that we are better equipped to identify with others in the same boat; be they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/aug/09/georgia.russia?picture=336376775\">fleeing villagers in Gori</a>, starving children in Harare, or impoverished residents of refugee camps trapped behind Israel's separation wall. Jewish philanthropy has saved countless lives around the world, and improved the lot of innumerable others, but when it comes to Israel, for many Jews there remains an insurmountable blind spot.</p> <p>Until the perspective of Nadia Matar and the other vanguards of religious Zionism changes for the better, there is little hope for those on the receiving end of their actions. And that is a modern-day calamity to befall the Jewish people, and one well worth mourning on such a tragic date in our calendar.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Scroll down for updates</strong></p> <p>With Gordon Brown still on holiday in Scotland, David Cameron is doing his best to seize the initiative. </p> <p>He was on the World at One yesterday with some very robust, gung-ho language about Russia, and he managed to ensure that when Brown's own statement on the crisis was released a couple of hours later, it sounded rather lame. (Although Cameron has the luxury of not having to deal with these people at the moment and, like all western politicians talking tough, he was very vague as to what sanctions he would actually use against the Russians in practice.)</p> <p>He will probably get asked about that this morning. </p> <p>It's started. Cameron is making a statement about the Georgian conflict. He says it looks as if Russia is trying to topple the Georgian regime, and as if it is trying to send a message to Ukraine and the central Asian states to the effect that they cannot afford to defy Moscow.</p> <p>He says the government must take various measures. Has the government summoned the Russian ambassador? Has the government proposed an urgent meeting of Nato foreign ministers? Is the government considering visa changes for Russian citizens? Is it considering calling for Russia to be suspended from the G8?</p> <p>He says that if Russia is allowed to get away with this, they will try similar tactics against other countries.</p> <p>He repeats the line he used yesterday: \"The only language bullies understand is when you face up to them.\"</p> <p>He is moving on to domestic concerns, and the economy.</p> <p>Today's inflation figures are very worrying for people trying to make ends meet, he says. But the government cannot wave a magic wand. </p> <p>On fuel prices, the Tories are considering flexible duty rates.</p> <p>On business, the Tories are looking at changes to insolvency laws.</p> <p><strong>10.30am</strong></p> <p>The government's decision to brief about the possibility of a stamp duty holiday was \"reckless\". It has frozen up the housing market.</p> <p>Cameron says he will be meeting the National Association of Estate Agents this afternoon. The association has asked three times to meet the chancellor, Alistair Darling, but he has refused to see them.</p> <p>The Conservatives are holding a seminar on housing. It will consider policies to free up the market, policies to prevent people having their homes prepossessed and measures that could stop the problem recurring. But the party won't be announcing policies.</p> <p>Then he invites questions.</p> <p><strong>Stamp duty</strong></p> <p>Vicky Young from the BBC asks if Cameron thinks abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers (the Tory policy) is responsible at a time when young people should not be encouraged to buy into the housing market.</p> <p>Cameron does not accept this. He says stamp duty is an issue for first-time buyers. But his plan will not rescue the housing market on its own.</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong></p> <p>Niall Patterson from Sky News asks if Cameron is accusing the government of inaction.</p> <p>Cameron says the government must engage with the issues. There are a series of things the government could do that would send \"a very clear message\" that what the Russians did was unacceptable.</p> <p>Because the Georgian strategy was \"misguided\", some people are unclear as to who is to blame.</p> <p>But Cameron says he is clear that Russia is in the wrong.</p> <p><strong>The next election</strong></p> <p>Graeme Wilson from the Sun asks if Cameron agrees with William Hague when he said last week that the Tories were the \"likely winners\" of the next election.</p> <p>Cameron says he does not use those words. \"There is no complacency\". There is a \"huge difference\" between people saying they want another government and people actually voting for his party at a general election.</p> <p>The Tories still have a \"long way to go\". There will be \"no smugness, no complacency\".</p> <p><strong>10.35am</strong></p> <p><strong>Green taxes/the Glasgow East \"fat\" speech/Preparing for government</strong></p> <p>James Lyons from the Mirror asks about three question in one go. It's probably a record.</p> <p>Asked about the session at the autumn conference called \"preparing for government\", Cameron says that is sensible planning. He says there was a session at the spring conference on preparing for government too. It does not mean he's being complacent.</p> <p>On green taxes, he says green taxes will be offset by tax cuts elsewhere.</p> <p>On the Glasgow speech, in which he said sometimes people were to blame for being fat, he says he stands by it.</p> <p>Lyons asked if he had discussed it with Eric Pickles (the local government spokesman, who is on the large side). Cameron does not comment on Pckles's girth directly, but he says that all members of the shadow cabinet supported it.</p> <p><strong>Georgia/David Miliband</strong></p> <p>Michael White from the Guardian asks about Georgia, and also whether Cameron agrees with Hague's verdict in the interview last week that David Miliband is a bit of a \"geek\".</p> <p>Cameron won't be drawn on Miliband. He claims not to know very much about who is or isn't a geek.</p> <p>On Georgia, he says it would be \"very dangerous\" to allow Russia to intervene in Georgia because of the interests of Russians living in South Ossetia.</p> <p>Mike says the Russians could be seen as having a legitimate interest in what happens in South Ossetia. (I haven't really done justice to his point, but <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/politics/2008/08/michael_whites_political_blog_220.html\">he blogged on this yesterday</a>.)</p> <p>Cameron says there is a difference between having a legitimate interest and invading.</p> <p><strong>Labour leadership</strong></p> <p>Would Cameron like to see Gordon Brown stay in post?</p> <p>Cameron says he has always used the line that it is hard enough to run your own party, without trying to talk about what should be happening in others. He says he has \"no idea\" what will happen within Labour</p> <p><strong>Repossessions</strong></p> <p>Jean Eaglesham from the FT asks if Cameron is in favour of statutory measures to prevent unnecessary home repossessions.</p> <p>Cameron says that is exactly the kind of issue that the party will be discussing at its housing seminar today.</p> <p><strong>10.45am</strong></p> <p>We're going to have to leave it there, I'm afraid, because I'm monitoring it from the TV and the live broadcasts have all dried up.</p> <p><strong>Summary</strong></p> <p><strong>Russia:</strong> More tough talk about Moscow. Cameron even answered my point about \"what would he do?\" with a short list of measures the government could be implementing, or at least considering. His words do leave the official Foreign Office/Downing Street response looking a bit feeble. </p> <p>In the scheme of things this probably did not amount to very much - comments that Brown and Cameron issued yesterday did not get much coverage in the papers today, as far as I could see - but it must be reassuring for the Tories to \"beat\" the government within the news cycle.</p> <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Again, Cameron scored another, easy hit. He criticised the government for damaging the housing market by briefing newspapers last week about the possibility of a stamp duty holiday and he revealed that the Tories are holding a seminar on the subject today. He has not got any policies to announce, but at least the Tories look concerned.</p> <p><strong>The Labour leadership situation:</strong> It's easy to imagine Cameron having something to say about this. He could have taunted Miliband for not standing against Brown, or praised him lavishly. But he chose to stay out of it.</p> <p><strong>That sun tan:</strong> Did you see it? I'm not quite sure how anyone gets a tan that good from a fortnight in Devon, but he certainly looks like a man who's had a good holiday.</p> <p>More politics news comment and analysis at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics\">theguardian.com/politics</a></p>",
  "<p>A radio station banned by the Chinese authorities has filed a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee after the Beijing organising committee (Bocog) failed to issue one of its correspondents with media accreditation.</p> <p>Dhondup Gonsar, who is of Tibetan descent and broadcasts in the Tibetan language on Radio Free Asia (RFA), is yet to receive his accreditation documents despite his application being approved by the IOC.</p> <p>The incident has undermined IOC claims that journalists would have freedom to report during these games. Under Beijing's Olympic contract with the IOC all accredited persons should be granted access to the country.</p> <p>Bocog is responsible for producing the actual accreditation document, which doubles as a visa. Yesterday Bocog said that Gonsar's documents remained \"in process\" and that a decision was \"pending\".</p> <p>IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said the matter had been \"flagged\" with Bocog but could not say when or if the documents would be issued. </p> <p>RFA, a non profit-making organisation sponsored by the US Congress, broadcasts within China via shortwave and on the internet, though its website is usually blocked by the authorities. It is critical of the Beijing regime and those in other undemocratic Asian states.</p> <p>Jill Ku Martin, chief correspondent of RFA's Mandarin service, said today she suspected her colleague had been barred because of his Tibetan nationality. \"We can only speculate as to why it is happening but he is of Tibetan descent and broadcasts in the Tibetan language,\" she said.</p>"
