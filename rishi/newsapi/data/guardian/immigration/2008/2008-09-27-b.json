  "<p>New landlords will have to show their tenants a certificate rating the energy efficiency of their property from Wednesday. Energy performance certificates, or EPCs, are already a mandatory part of the Home Information Pack provided by anyone selling a home but, from 1 October, the certificate must also be available for prospective tenants to review. Existing landlords who are starting a new tenancy will also need to provide an EPC for review.</p> <p>The EPC will give the property an energy rating on a scale from A to G, with A the most efficient. The certificate will also contain recommendations to improve the property's energy efficiency, costs of the recommendations, typical savings per year and an estimated performance rating after improvement. Landlords are under no obligation to carry out any of the improvements.</p> <p>Although the number of people renting properties has increased by 20 per cent in the last three months, the majority of landlords still haven't obtained an EPC for their property ahead of the deadline, says John Heron, managing director of buy-to-let specialist Paragon Mortgages, which is advising landlords to get their EPCs as quickly as possible.</p> <p>EPCs cost from \u00a350 to \u00a3150, depending on the firm carrying out the energy assessment. Failure to comply with the legislation could result in a \u00a3200 fine.</p> <p>Landmark Information Group (<a href=\"http://www.hcrregister.com/searchassessor.html\">hcrregister.com/searchassessor.html</a>) has a list of accredited energy assessors.</p> <p><strong>Fashion stores increase interest on cards </strong></p> <p>Interest rates on store cards are rising, making it even more important for store cardholders to pay off their balances on time. Fashion chains Karen Millen and Oasis have both raised the interest rates on their cards from 24.9 per cent to 28.9 per cent, while Principles has gone from 24.6 per cent to 28.9 per cent. They have also cut the minimum payment required each month from 4 per cent of the outstanding balance to 3.65 per cent.</p> <p>'Some people might think it's brilliant that their minimum payment has been cut, as they could pay less each month, but [doing that] could cost you a lot of money in interest and it will take you far longer to pay off,' says Michelle Slade, analyst at price comparison site Moneyfacts.co.uk. While many retailers offer discounts to those taking out a store card, Slade warns that shoppers should think twice before signing up.</p> <p><strong>Cheap international calls on new free Sims</strong></p> <p>A new pay-as-you-go Sim card is promising to help mobile phone users cut their bills by offering reduced rates on international calls. Lycamobile Sim cards can be slotted into an existing mobile handset when the user needs to make an international call, with costs starting at around 4p a minute.</p> <p>The Sim card comes free when you purchase your phone credit. Users can top up by \u00a35, \u00a310 or \u00a315 online at <a href=\"http://www.lycamobile.co.uk\">lycamobile.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>Last week telecoms regulators in Brussels, who first cut the cost of international calls last summer, also moved against 'rip-off' text charges. The cost of sending an SMS for consumers on holiday or travelling abroad for business will fall by 60 per cent, from a European average of 23p to 9p.</p> <p>The EU's top telecoms official, Viviane Reding, said she was putting the new rules forward because mobile-telephone companies had not responded to her call for them to lower the roaming charges for sending or receiving text messages outside a user's home nation.</p> <p><strong>Overdraft warning for pushy parents</strong></p> <p>Parents are being warned not to stray too far into their overdrafts to fund their children's expectations.</p> <p>According to the latest NS&amp;I savings survey, parents are putting their financial priorities on the back burner so that their children can get ahead. Nearly 30 per cent of parents are going into their overdrafts, taking out a loan or using credit cards because they don't want their children to miss out on the 'best opportunities', such as music and sports lessons, cultural trips or extra tuition. Meanwhile, over 76 per cent have cut down on socialising and over 50 per cent work longer hours to earn more money for their family.</p> <p>Tim Mack, senior savings spokesman at NS&amp;I, says parents need to budget and prioritise to stay in control when contemplating spending on the kids.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Track one:</strong> 'Intro' (2008)</p> <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Nia Jai, featuring Rio Ferdinand</p> <p><strong>Key lyric:</strong> So distorted are his vocals, it sounds as if Rio literally phoned in his contribution to this opening track of Nia Jai's album Black Ice (released by White Chalk, the England player's own label, on 8 October). 'Make sure you don't sleep on this girl,' you can just about hear him say, 'this girl spits out \ufb01y-ah.'</p> <p><strong>Track two:</strong> 'Don't Tread' (2006)</p> <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Clint 'Deuce' Dempsey</p> <p><strong>Key lyric: </strong>Raps the Fulham mid\ufb01elder: 'I make the game ferocious, I got that from my coaches!' Dempsey adopted the street name of 'Deuce' for the track, recorded to promote the USA's World Cup bid in 2006.</p> <p><strong>Track three:</strong> 'Ich Roque' (2004)</p> <p><strong>Artist:</strong> Sportfreunde Stiller featuring Roque Santa Cruz</p> <p><strong>Key lyric:</strong> The Blackburn striker doesn't exactly sing in this German rock song (inspired by his performances for Bayern Munich), but he does gutturally growl the words 'Ich Roque' every so often. Sportfreunde Stiller's song for the 2006 World Cup topped the charts in Germany.</p> <p><strong>Track four </strong>'Shake My Play Mo, Bitch' (2006)</p> <p><strong>Artist: </strong>Djibril Ciss\u00e9</p> <p><strong>Key lyric:</strong> 'Ain't nothing, start fucking!' sings the Sunderland striker in this raunchy \u2013 surprisingly catchy \u2013 tune. 'Let's get this party jumping!'</p> <p><strong>Track \ufb01ve: </strong>'This Is For Real' (2006)</p> <p><strong>Artist: </strong> Morten Gamst Pedersen</p> <p><strong>Key lyric: </strong>The Blackburn winger rolls through rock's cliches ('You've got me down on my knees ...') in a stirring power ballad with his band, the Players.</p> <p><strong>Track six: </strong> 'Dejala Tevez' (2005)</p> <p><strong>Artist: </strong>Carlos Tevez and Piola Vago</p> <p><strong>Key lyric: </strong>The Argentinian's 'urban shantytown' band sing in Spanish, mostly about Carlito's rise to the top. The title of this track translates as 'Leave it to Tevez', but a new song about his love for Manchester United is in the works, entitled 'My Love Affair'. Really.</p> <p><strong>Track seven: </strong>'Skin ' (2007)</p> <p><strong>Artist: </strong>Wills and the Willing, featuring Michael Essien and Didier Drogba</p> <p><strong>Key lyric: </strong> In this toe-curling anti-racism charity song ('Black, brown, yellow, white, pink, red ... we're all the same make!'), the Chelsea duo pop up to say things like 'My name is Michael Essien and I was born in Ghana'. Well, only one of them says that\u2026</p>",

  "<p>Even the writer can't believe his luck. The cast of a film version of British journalist Jon Ronson's acclaimed book The Men Who Stare at Goats sounds too starry to be true. Actor George Clooney, who bought the film rights at the Cannes film festival this spring, has assembled a line-up to rival the biggest of Hollywood blockbusters. Jeff Bridges and Ewan McGregor agreed to star with Clooney in the anti-war satire over the summer, and this weekend Kevin Spacey confirmed he is free to start filming early next month.</p> <p>Spacey, who is artistic director at London's Old Vic, said he would attend the opening night of his fifth season at the theatre on 6 October and then join the cast in New Mexico and Puerto Rico. 'It examines a secret special forces unit in the United States army that was experimenting whether they could achieve the ability to kill the enemy psychically,' he said.</p> <p>Ronson's non-fiction book came out in 2004 to coincide with his television Channel 4 television series Crazy Rulers of the World. It told the improbable story of a secret unit of CIA operatives who had experimented with unlikely methods of tackling the enemy. These included developing homicidal psychic powers; they practiced by concentrating hard on goats, then examining the effect. The team, Ronson discovered, received covert funding from the US government shortly after the Vietnam war.</p> <p>'When I tell people who is going to be in the film, they look at me blankly, obviously not believing me,' said Ronson. 'Or they say, \"I knew if you hung around for long enough something like this would happen for you one day.\" I suspect most also feel slightly sick.'</p> <p>The fictionalised adaptation has been written by Peter Straughan, who has set it in present-day Iraq. Clooney will play Lyn Cassady, a former member of the unit. McGregor plays Bob Wilton, a reporter who travels through Iraq with Cassady in search of a new secret unit working on paranormal powers. Bridges is cast as Bill Django, the programme founder, with Spacey as Larry Hopper, a former psychic soldier running a prison camp in Iraq.</p> <p>In Ronson's C4 documentary, he tried to track down the truth about experiments carried out at America's Fort Bragg, in which a sergeant reportedly stopped a goat's heart by force of will. Ronson eventually found Major General Albert Stubblebine III, the US army's former head of Intelligence and Security Command, who said it was merely lack of focus that had thwarted his efforts to walk through walls. 'There's the wall's space and there's my space. All you gotta do is merge the spaces. But I didn't master it, Jon. I kept bumping my nose. If you really want to know, it's a disappointment,' he said.</p> <p>The documentary proved the impact of the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s on the US military. The founder of the unit, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Channon, had returned from Vietnam determined to find non-violent means of waging war. He came up with the First Earth Battalion, a force that would carry lambs, wear monks' hoods and play soothing music to the enemy through loudspeakers.</p> <p>So if Ronson finds still the stellar cast of the film hard to believe, he should remember that the most bizarre stories often turn out to be true.</p>",
  "<p>The man who has inherited Jorg Haider's mantle as the figurehead of Austria's far right is expected to scoop up a fifth of the popular vote in national elections today in the latest advance for a European party campaigning on anti-immigration policies. </p> <p>The dramatic rise of Heinz-Christian Strache and the once ailing Freedom Party, formerly led by Haider, has accompanied growing Austrian sentiment against foreigners, economic woes and a widespread disillusionment with the two main centrist parties.</p> <p>Today's expected results will be seen as a triumph for Strache, a politician who has made a virtue of being even tougher on immigrants than his party's former leader. Polls have suggested that substantial numbers of the young and elderly, blue-collar workers and middle classes will turn out to vote for the man who strengthened his popularity through slogans such as: 'If you want an apartment, all you need is a headscarf.' </p> <p>In interviews and rallies, Strache has railed against the leading figures of the political establishment, labelling the country's leaders as 'clowns' and 'traitors' who have 'sold out' Austria to foreigners. His old friend Haider - who led a breakaway from the Freedom Party in 2005 - is now called a 'political dwarf'.</p> <p>Since the split, Haider has accused Strache of leading the party ever further to the 'extreme right', an image that Strache has struggled to shake off. When Strache, 39, tried to sue for libel a news magazine that accused him of having neo-Nazi contacts the court ruled in the magazine's favour, saying it had presented an 'adequate factual basis to demonstrate a certain nearness to national socialist ideas'.</p> <p>Strache attended an event organised by Viking Youth in Germany some years ago, a group later banned for its extreme right position.</p> <p>Despite polling that suggests immigration has become an obsession for Austria's electorate, many observers believe the real popularity of the Freedom Party and Strache has its roots in a desire for robust opposition to the coalition of the Social Democrats and the People's Party.</p> <p>'People felt that there had to be an opposition,' says Klaus Poier, of the University of Graz. 'Many people who support the Freedom Party do not necessarily want it to be in government.' </p> <p>Poier and other analysts have also noted that part of Strache's success has been his ability to turn allegations against him into a populist argument (stolen from Haider) that the attacks are against the ordinary people who support him, encapsulated in the slogan: 'They're against him because he's for you!'</p> <p>In one of Vienna's working-class districts last week, one of the immigrants whom Strache has in his sights was scathing. '[Freedom] talks a lot, but never does anything,' said 48-year-old warehouse worker Smail Alilovic, who came to Austria from Bosnia in 1994.</p>",
  "<p>It's 1998 and I'm trying to interview Anna Kournikova. It's a bit like attempting to secure an audience with a world leader, which, Kournikova's handlers would have you believe, she is. Billed as 'the most downloaded female on the planet', she is flanked by a battalion of handlers, agents, managers and other assorted obstructionists.</p> <p>There are months of delays and unreturned calls. When I am favoured with the courtesy of a response, the communication is annoying in the extreme. Can you send questions in advance? Can you embed references to the products of Anna's sponsors in whatever you write? That would really help speed the process! Finally, after more than a year, I am granted a 10-minute session at a hotel in New Jersey where Kournikova is being paid a prince(ss)ly fee to play in a weekend tennis exhibition. Monitored by yet another handler, she spends the excruciating session chomping on pink gum, staring at her nails, and performing a nimble feat of dialogue by giving yes/no answers to questions that begin with the word 'how'.</p> <p>It's 2008 and I'm trying to interview Anna Kournikova. Half an hour before the meeting, my mobile chirps. I steel myself for a call apologising for a last-minute change of plans. But, no, it's Anna - on an unblocked number - confirming that she is running on schedule and if I'm having trouble finding a parking space at the Starbucks where we are scheduled to meet, I can always park at the adjacent Whole Foods. She arrives alone, pulling up in a tasteful but hardly ostentatious car. She makes eye contact. She chews no gum. Ninety minutes into what is more a conversation than an interview, she is still going strong. No, I'm forced to admit, I have not read the book Eat, Pray, Love. 'You really should,' she says. 'It's spiritual, but well written at the same time.'</p> <p>She's 27 now and, while she pretty much looks the same, Anna Kournikova bears only the vaguest resemblance to the one-woman international conglomerate that damn near hijacked women's tennis a decade ago. While she is unwilling to concede that she has retired, she has not played a WTA Tour match in more than five years. The regal prom queen who once remarked to a suitor, 'You can't afford me,' is now recommending literature. The tennis mercenary who allegedly made $50m in off-court income before the age of 18 is now an ambassador for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America - which sounds like so much PR until you learn that in April she went to gritty Tijuana, Mexico, to help open a youth facility.</p> <p>When it's pointed out how little the Kournikova of today conforms to the image she created years ago, she nods her head so forcefully her Gucci sunglasses nearly fly off her face. 'Of course I'm a different person! People say, \"I can't believe how much you've changed!\" What did they expect? People grow, evolve. It would be sad if I didn't change!'</p> <p>Kournikova is now a Ripo - Russian in passport only. She holds a green card and lives full-time in Miami Beach, the port she entered in 1992, when she was a 10-year-old prodigy armed with talent and attitude in equal measure. 'When Anna won a point, it wasn't an achievement,' recalls Nick Bollettieri, her first American coach. 'That was how it was supposed to go. I mean, she was Anna Kournikova.' At 14 she won the Orange Bowl, the top international junior event. In 1997, aged 16, she lost in the semi-finals at Wimbledon to Martina Hingis. The next year, she beat Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Steffi Graf, reached the fourth round of the US and French Opens, and cracked the top 20. Anna Inc. was open for business.</p> <p>The Kournikova phenomenon was a classic case of harmonic convergence. Women's sports - tennis in particular - were growing in popularity, eyed as a promising frontier by sports marketers. The internet enabled fans from Minsk to Minneapolis to access Kournikova in a way they never could, say, Chris Evert. As the global economy kicked in, you could scarcely find a more ideal exponent for it than an exotic Russian who spoke flawless English and performed all over the world.</p> <p>Kournikova embraced it all. A daughter of communism (she was born in Moscow in 1981) took commercialism to new extremes. She endorsed products from watches to brokerage firms to sports bras, virtually every campaign built around her looks rather than her athletic prowess. When she was not pushing products, she was striking come-hither poses for magazines. The pundits could debate whether this was a feminist setback or a feminist triumph. 'What is she supposed to say, \"No, I don't want your money?\" That's like winning the lottery and then saying, \"No, I don't really deserve it,\"' no less than Martina Navratilova once said of Kournikova. Meanwhile, Kournikova was making bundles of cash for her sponsors, her tour, her agents and, not least, herself. Nathalie Tauziat, a higher-ranked but less publicised WTA player at the time, called Kournikova 'a blonde windfall'.</p> <p>But Kournikova's cult of personality exacted a price on her tennis. While the contagion known as Annamania raged and hormonally charged boys showed up en masse at women's tennis matches, an inconvenient truth persisted: Kournikova had never won a singles tournament. Pitted against the hype, her ability had little chance. Distraction was her destruction. In the retelling, Kournikova was the tennis equivalent of the NFL's William 'The Fridge' Perry, a unique physical specimen rather than a creditable athlete. </p> <p>In truth - and this is what gives the story a slightly tragic ring - Kournikova was abundantly gifted. She played whimsical, well rounded tennis and excelled at the net, an area of the court most contemporary players avoid as if it were quicksand. She reached as high as eighth in the singles rankings and in 1999 was the world's top doubles player. But the weight of never having won a title ultimately crushed her. 'I put pressure on myself, especially as I got older,' she says. 'At 16, 17 you have no fear. You don't think or analyse. You just play on automatic. You can get smarter as you get older, but in sports you can be too smart, you know?'</p> <p>Her fragile psyche was compounded by a fragile body. Foot, back and ankle injuries forestalled her career. By the spring of 2003 she was playing low-level events in an attempt to revive her game. That May she withdrew from a match against a 16-year-old arriviste named Maria Sharapova. The following week in Charlottesville, Virginia, she lost to a Brazilian ranked outside the top 300 and has not played a sanctioned match since.</p> <p>Her impact went beyond internet photo galleries. Following the trail blazed at least in part by Kournikova, there are five players in the WTA's top 10 from Russia or the former Soviet Union. 'Anna,' says seventh-ranked Svetlana Kuznetsova, 'showed there was possibility through tennis.' As playing careers go, however, Kournikova's is a case of sizzle beating steak, in straight sets.</p> <p>In assessing her record, Kournikova speaks with such candour and detachment that it's almost as if she is describing another person. 'In a perfect world, would I have won a tournament? Yes. But I wasn't able to string those matches together. Sometimes I got unlucky, and sometimes I just lost.' Regrets? 'Not a thing. Except to be a little stronger physically. Come on, regrets? I grew up a little girl in the Soviet Union playing at a small sports club. Tennis gave me my life.' Does she wish she had reined in the hype machine? 'It's hard. We did the best we could. But there was no blueprint.' And whatever you do, don't lavish her with a shred of sympathy. 'Hey, I took the money. It's simple. If you don't want the attention, don't take the money.'</p> <p>Tennis rivals boxing in the frequency of comebacks, so don't be surprised if Kournikova joins the ranks of the 'unretired'. She works out daily and this spring ran four miles in just under 29 minutes in a charity triathlon in Miami. Though her hands are noticeably free of calluses, she plays tennis a few times a week, sometimes on public courts not far from her waterfront home. In July she played in two matches for the St Louis Aces in the World Team Tennis league. 'Honestly, who knows?' she says. 'I'm young enough to still play. But physically could I take it?'</p> <p>She spends her days living what she admits is a charmed existence. Her parents, Alla and Sergei, divorced in 2004, but Alla moved to Palm Beach, remarried and has a three-year-old son, whose half-sister is all too happy to babysit. 'I get my kid fix,' she says. 'Then I say, \"Here ya go, Mom. See ya.\"' Kournikova is a spokesperson for sports shoe firm K-Swiss. She reads. When the urge strikes, she hits the South Beach clubs. And there are those Boys and Girls Club fundraisers. 'Don't get the wrong idea,' she says.

  "<p>Ed Harris made his directorial debut eight years ago in a biography of Jackson Pollock in which he played the title role. He's now followed this up with a fine western, Appaloosa. This is singularly appropriate. Back in the postwar decade, Pollock's paintings were promoted in the Cold War as an expression of American freedom and individuality, while Pollock was sold to a US public more than a little hostile to abstract art as the archetypal western hero.</p> <p>Pollock was born near Cody, Wyoming, a town named in honour of Buffalo Bill, and drifted around Arizona with itinerant workers before heading east as, in the words of his biographer BH Friedman: 'A hard-riding, hard-drinking cowboy from the Wild West who came roaring, maybe even shooting, his way into New York where he took the art galleries by storm.'</p> <p>Based on a novel by Robert B Parker (creator of the Boston private eye Spenser), Appaloosa not only stars its director, but he's also co-scriptwriter and producer, and sings a Willie Nelson-style song over the final credits. In addition, he's cast his father Bob as a grizzled frontier judge who presides over a murder trial in an improvised court and has one of the film's best lines. 'You got a horse, son?' he asks a witness who's just testified against a ruthless killer. 'Then you better get on it now, ride fast and don't look back.' Yet this is no vanity project. It's a handsome, subtle, sober film, well acted all around, that plays interesting variations on familiar themes, deliberately alluding to High Noon, Rio Bravo, 3.10 to Yuma, My Darling Clementine and Unforgiven.</p> <p>Set in New Mexico in the early 1880s, the film is narrated by Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), a West Point-trained ex-cavalry officer who's given up Indian fighting to become deputy to the hardened lawman Virgil Cole (Ed Harris). For a dozen years, they've been travelling the West, imposing order on new communities, and they're called to the town of Appaloosa by the venal city fathers led by a pompous merchant and saloon owner (Timothy Spall). Their task is to bring to justice rancher-businessman Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), friend of the 21st US President Chester Arthur. Bragg intends to take over the local copper mines, until recently threatened by Apaches, and dominate the territory, and his band of hired ruffians have killed Appaloosa's marshal and two deputies. Cole accepts the job and quite literally before the ink has dried on a contract of his own devising, he and Hitch have killed three of Bragg's men.</p> <p>There follows a contest of will and nerve between Cole and Bragg that leads to a daring arrest, the holding of the rancher for trial, and the dangerous journey by train to the territorial penitentiary. Into Cole's life comes a good-looking widow, Allison French (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger), for whom he falls, though perceiving her contradictions. His hostage to fortune, she's an innocent schemer, not one of the 'whores and squaws' he's previously associated with, but still a puzzling cross between saloon girl and homemaker. </p> <p>Each incident is familiar but smartly handled and given a little twist. There's the pursuit of Bragg and the gunslingers who've kidnapped the widow and sprung him, an encounter with a party of Apache braves, and an outstandingly staged shoot-out in the plaza of an old Spanish town that, like the gunfight at the OK Corral, is brief and deadly. </p> <p>Magnificently shot by Australian photographer Dean Semler (he worked on Dances With Wolves and the TV mini-series Lonesome Dove), the film has an authentic feel without the corrosive cynicism that often tarnishes revisionist westerns. And it's a clean piece of storytelling that dispenses with narrative bridges: the passing of a considerable stretch of time, for instance, is conveyed by the skeleton of a house Cole is building for Mrs French suddenly becoming a comfortable home.</p> <p>But ultimately the most attractive aspect of this film resides in the leading characters and, most especially, the relationship between Mortensen and Harris, so splendid together in Cronenberg's A History of Violence. A variation on Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp, they're complementary, mutually respecting men of honour. Hitch is introspective, articulate, educated, reserved, while Cole is compulsive, explosive, an autodidact who knows little of himself. A running joke involves Cole's search for the mot juste he hasn't quite grasped from his reading of Emerson and other deep authors, and he constantly turns to Hitch for a prompt. This joke is extended to the misspelt sign over the sheriff's office saying 'CITY MARSHALL', which presumably Cole hasn't noticed and Hitch is too gentlemanly to point out.</p>",
  "<p>On 3 May 2005, in France, a man called an emergency hotline for missing and exploited children. He frantically explained that he was a tourist passing through Orthez, near the western Pyrenees, and that at the train station he had encountered a 15-year-old boy who was alone, and terrified. Another hotline received a similar call, and the boy eventually arrived, by himself, at a local government child-welfare office. Slender and short, with pale skin and trembling hands, he wore a muffler around much of his face and had a baseball cap pulled over his eyes. He had no money and carried little more than a mobile phone and ID which said that his name was Francisco Hernandez Fernandez and that he was born on 13 December 1989 in C\u00e1ceres, Spain. Initially he barely spoke, but after some prodding he revealed that his parents and younger brother had been killed in a car accident. The crash left him in a coma for several weeks and, upon recovering, he was sent to live with an uncle, who abused him. Finally he fled to France, where his mother had grown up.</p> <p>French authorities placed Francisco at the St Vincent de Paul shelter in the nearby city of Pau. A state-run institution that housed about 35 boys and girls, most of whom had either been removed from dysfunctional families or abandoned, the shelter was in an old stone building with peeling white wooden shutters; on the roof was a statue of St Vincent protecting a child in the folds of his gown. Francisco was given a single room, and he seemed relieved to be able to wash and change in private: his head and body, he explained, were covered in burns and scars from the car accident. He was enrolled at the Coll\u00e8ge Jean Monnet, a local secondary school that had 400 or so students, mostly from tough neighbourhoods, and a reputation for violence. Although students were forbidden to wear hats, the principal at the time, Claire Chadourne, made an exception for Francisco, who said that he feared being teased about his scars. Like many of the social workers and teachers who dealt with Francisco, Chadourne, who had been an educator for more than 30 years, felt protective towards him. With his baggy pants and his mobile phone dangling from a cord around his neck, he looked like a typical teenager, but he seemed deeply traumatised. He never changed his clothes in front of the others in gym class, and resisted being subjected to a medical exam. He spoke softly, with his head bowed, and recoiled if anyone touched him.</p> <p>Gradually Francisco began hanging out with other kids at break and participating in class. Since he had enrolled so late in the school year, his literature teacher asked another student, Rafael Pessoa De Almeida, to help him with his coursework. Before long, Francisco was helping Rafael. 'This guy can learn like lightning,' Rafael recalls thinking.</p> <p>One day after school, Rafael asked Francisco if he wanted to go ice skating, and the two became friends, playing video games and sharing school gossip. Rafael sometimes picked on his younger brother, and Francisco, recalling that he used to mistreat his own sibling, advised: 'Make sure you love your brother and stay close.'</p> <p>At one point Rafael borrowed Francisco's mobile phone; to his surprise, its address book and call log were protected by security codes. When Rafael returned the phone, Francisco displayed a photograph on its screen of a young boy who looked just like Francisco. 'That's my brother,' he said.</p> <p>Francisco was soon one of the most popular kids in school, dazzling classmates with his knowledge of music and arcane slang - he even knew American idioms - and moving effortlessly between rival cliques. 'The students loved him,' a teacher recalls. 'He had this aura about him, this charisma.'</p> <p>During tryouts for a talent show, the music teacher asked Francisco if he was interested in performing. He handed her a CD to play, then walked to the end of the room and tilted his hat flamboyantly, waiting for the music to start. As Michael Jackson's song 'Unbreakable' filled the room, Francisco started to dance like the pop star, twisting his limbs and lip-synching the words 'You can't believe it, you can't conceive it/And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable'. Everyone in the room watched in awe. 'He didn't just look like Michael Jackson,' the music teacher recalled. 'He was Michael Jackson.'</p> <p>Later, in computer class, Francisco showed Rafael an internet image of a small reptile with a slithery tongue. 'What is it?' Rafael asked. 'A chameleon,' Francisco replied.</p> <p>On 8 June, an administrator rushed into the principal's office. She said she'd been watching a TV programme about one of the world's most infamous impostors: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin, a 30-year-old Frenchman who serially impersonated children. 'I swear to God, Bourdin looks exactly like Francisco Hernandez Fernandez,' the administrator said.</p> <p>Chadourne was incredulous: 30 would make Francisco older than some of her teachers. She did a quick internet search for 'Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin'. Hundreds of news items came up about the 'king of impostors' and the 'master of new identities' who, like Peter Pan, 'didn't want to grow up'. A photograph of Bourdin closely resembled Francisco: there was the same formidable chin, the same gap between the front teeth. Chadourne called the police.</p> <p>When they arrived, Chadourne sent the assistant principal to summon Francisco from class. As Francisco entered Chadourne's office, the police seized him and thrust him against the wall, causing her to panic: what if he really was an abused orphan? Then, while handcuffing Bourdin, the police removed his baseball cap. There were no scars on his head; rather, he was going bald. 'I want a lawyer,' he said, his voice suddenly dropping to that of a man.</p> <p>At the police station, he admitted he was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin, and that in the past 15 years he had invented scores of identities. His aliases included Benjamin Kent, Jimmy Morins, Alex Dole, Sladjan Raskovic, Arnaud Orions, Giovanni Petrullo and Michelangelo Martini. News reports claimed he had even impersonated a tiger tamer and a priest, but in truth he had nearly always played a similar character: an abused or abandoned child. He was unusually adept at transforming his appearance - his facial hair, his weight, his walk, his mannerisms. 'I can become whatever I want,' he liked to say. In 2004, when he pretended to be a 14-year-old French boy in the town of Grenoble, a doctor who examined him at the request of authorities concluded he was, indeed, a teenager. A police captain in Pau noted, 'When he talked in Spanish, he became a Spaniard. When he talked in English, he was an Englishman.' Chadourne said of him: 'Of course he lied, but what an actor!'</p> <p>Over the years, Bourdin had insinuated himself into youth shelters, orphanages, foster homes, junior high schools and children's hospitals. His trail of cons extended to, among other places, Spain, Germany, Belgium, England, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Bosnia, Portugal, Austria, France, Slovakia, Sweden, Denmark and America. The US State Department warned he was an 'exceedingly clever' man who posed as a desperate child in order to 'win sympathy', and a French prosecutor called him 'an incredible illusionist whose perversity is matched only by his intelligence'. Bourdin himself has said, 'I am a manipulator... My job is to manipulate.'</p> <p>In Pau, the authorities launched an investigation to determine why a 30-year-old man would pose as a teenage orphan. They found no evidence of sexual deviance or paedophilia; they did not uncover any financial motive either.</p> <p>'In my 22 years on the job, I've never seen a case like it,' Eric Maurel, the prosecutor said. 'Usually people con for money. His profit seems to have been purely emotional.'</p> <p>On his right forearm, police discovered a tattoo. It said 'cam\u00e9l\u00e9on nantais' - 'Chameleon from Nantes'.</p> <p>'Mr Grann,' Bourdin said, politely extending his hand to me. We were on a street in the centre of Pau, where he had agreed to meet me one morning last autumn. For once he seemed unmistakably an adult. He was dressed theatrically, in white trousers and shirt, a checked vest, white shoes, a blue satin bow tie and a foppish hat. Only the gap between his teeth evoked the memory of Francisco Hernandez Fernandez.</p> <p>After his ruse in Pau had been exposed, Bourdin moved to a village in the Pyrenees, 25 miles away. 'I wanted to escape from all the glare,' he said. As had often been the case with Bourdin's deceptions, the authorities were not sure how to punish him. Psychiatrists determined that he was sane. ('Is he a psychopath?' one doctor testified. 'Absolutely not.') Ultimately, he was charged with obtaining and using a fake ID, and received a six-month suspended sentence.</p> <p>Bourdin and I sat down on a bench near the train station as a light rain began to fall. A car paused by the kerb in front of us, with a couple inside. They rolled down the window, peered out, and said to each other: 'Le Cam\u00e9l\u00e9on.'</p> <p>'I am quite famous in France these days,' Bourdin said. 'Too famous.'</p> <p>As we spoke, his brown eyes flitted across me, seemingly taking me in. One of his police interrogators called him a 'human recorder'. To my surprise, Bourdin knew where I'd worked, where I was born, the name of my wife, even what my sister and brother did for a living. 'I like to know who I'm meeting,' he said. 'I don't trust anybody,' he went on. For a person who described himself as a 'professional liar', he seemed oddly fastidious about the facts of his own life. </p> <p>'I don't want you to make me into somebody I'm not. The story is good enough without embellishment.' </p> <p>I knew Bourdin had grown up in and around Nantes, and I asked him about his tattoo. Why would someone who tried to erase his identity leave a trace of one? He rubbed his arm where the words were imprinted on his skin. Then he said, 'I will tell you the truth behind all my lies.'</p> <p>Before he was Benjamin Kent or Michelangelo Martini - before he was the child of an English judge or an Italian diplomat - he was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pierre Bourdin, the illegitimate son of Ghislaine Bourdin, who was 18 and poor when she gave birth to him, in a suburb of Paris, on 13 June 1974. On government forms, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's father is often listed as 'X', meaning his identity was unknown. But Ghislaine, during an interview at her small house in a rural area in western France, told me that 'X' was a 25-year-old Algerian immigrant named Kaci whom she had met at a margarine factory where they both worked. She said that she could no longer remember his surname. After she became pregnant, she discovered Kaci was already married, and so she left her job and did not tell him she was carrying his child.</p> <p>Ghislaine raised Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric until he was two-and-a-half - 'He was like any other child, totally normal,' she says - at which time child services intervened at the behest of her parents. A relative says of Ghislaine: 'She liked to drink and dance and stay out at night. She didn't want anything to do with that child.' Ghislaine insists she had obtained another factory job and was perfectly competent, but the judge placed Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric in her parents' custody. Years later, Ghislaine wrote Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric a letter, telling him: 'You are my son and they stole you from me at the age of two. They did everything to separate us from each other and we have become two strangers.'</p> <p>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric says his mother had a dire need for attention, and on the rare occasions he saw her, she would feign being deathly ill and make him run to get help. 'To see me frightened gave her pleasure,' he says. Though Ghislaine denies this, she acknowledges that she once attempted suicide and her son had to rush to find assistance.</p> <p>When Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was five, he moved with his grandparents to Mouchamps, a hamlet southeast of Nantes. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric - part Algerian and fatherless, and dressed in secondhand clothes from Catholic charities - was a village outcast, and in school he began to tell fabulous stories about himself. He said his father was never around because he was a 'British secret agent'. One of his primary school teachers, Yvon Bourgueil, describes Bourdin as a precocious and captivating child, who had an extraordinary imagination and visual sense, drawing wild, beautiful comic strips. 'He had this way of making you connect to him,' Bourgueil recalls. He also noticed signs of mental distress. At one point, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric told his grandparents that he had been molested by a neighbour, though nobody in the tightly knit village investigated the allegation. In one of his comic strips, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric depicted himself drowning in a river. He increasingly misbehaved, acting up in class and stealing from neighbours. At 12 he was sent to live at Les Gr\u00e9zilli\u00e8res, a private facility for juveniles in Nantes.</p> <p>There, his 'little dramas', as one of his teachers called them, became more fanciful. Bourdin often pretended to be an amnesiac, intentionally getting lost in the streets. In 1990, after he turned 16, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was forced to move to another youth home, but he soon ran away. He hitchhiked to Paris where, scared and hungry, he invented his first fake character: he approached a police officer and told him he was a lost British teenager named Jimmy Sale. </p> <p>'I dreamed they would send me to England, where I always imagined life was more beautiful,' he recalls. When the police discovered that he spoke almost no English, he admitted his deceit and was returned to the youth home. But he had devised what he calls his 'technique', and in this fashion he began to wander across Europe, moving in and out of orphanages and foster homes, searching for the 'perfect shelter'. In 1991, he was found in a train station in Langres, France, pretending to be sick, and was placed in a children's hospital in Saint Dizier. According to his medical report, no one knew 'who he was or where he came from'. Answering questions only in writing, he indicated that his name was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cassis - a play on his father's first name, Kaci. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's doctor, Jean-Paul Milanese, wrote in a letter to a child-welfare judge: 'We find ourselves confronted with a young runaway teen, mute, having broken with his former life.'</p> <p>On a piece of paper, Bourdin scribbled what he wanted most: 'A home and a school. That's all.'</p> <p>When doctors started to unravel his past, Bourdin confessed his real identity and moved on. 'I'd rather leave on my own than be taken away,' he told me. During his career as an impostor, Bourdin often disclosed the truth, as if the attention that came from exposure was as thrilling as the con itself.</p> <p>On 13 June 1992, after he had posed as more than a dozen fictional children, Bourdin turned 18, becoming a legal adult. 'I'd been in shelters and foster homes most of my life, and suddenly I was told: \"That's it. You're free to go,\"' he recalls. 'How could I become something I could not imagine?' In November 1993, posing as a mute child, he lay down in the middle of a street in the French town of Auch and was taken by firemen to a hospital. La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi, a local newspaper, ran a story about him, asking: 'Where does this mute adolescent... come from?' The next day, the paper published another article, under the headline 'The Mute Adolescent Who Appeared Out of Nowhere Has Still Not Revealed His Secret'. After fleeing, he was caught attempting a similar ruse nearby and admitted he was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin. 'The Mute of Auch Speaks Four Languages,' La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi proclaimed.</p> <p>As Bourdin assumed more and more identities, he attempted to kill off his real one. One day the mayor of Mouchamps received a call from the 'German police' notifying him that Bourdin's body had been found in Munich. When Bourdin's mother was told the news, she recalls, 'My heart stopped.' Members of Bourdin's family waited for a coffin to arrive, but it never did. 'It was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric playing one of his cruel games,' his mother says.</p> <p>By the mid-Nineties, Bourdin had accumulated a criminal record for lying to police and magistrates, and Interpol and other authorities were increasingly on the lookout for him. His activities were also garnering media attention. In 1995 the producers of a popular French TV programme called Everything Is Possible invited him on to the show. As Bourdin appeared on stage, looking pale and prepubescent, the host teasingly asked the audience: 'What's this boy's name? Michael, J\u00fcrgen, Kevin or Pedro? What's his real age - 13, 14, 15?' Pressed about his motivations, Bourdin again insisted all he wanted was love and a family. It was the same rationale he always gave, and as a result he was the rare impostor who elicited sympathy as well as anger from those he had duped. (His mother has a less charitable interpretation of her son's stated motive: 'He wants to justify what he has become.')</p> <p>The producers of Everything Is Possible were so affected by his story that they offered him a job in the station's newsroom, but he soon ran off to create more 'interior fictions', as one of the producers later told a reporter. At times, Bourdin's deceptions were viewed in existential terms. One of his devotees in France created a website that celebrated his shape-shifting, hailing him as an 'actor of life and an apostle of a new philosophy of human identity'.</p> <p>One day when I was visiting Bourdin, he described how he transformed himself. First, he said, he conceived of a person whom he wanted to play. Then he gradually mapped out the character's biography, from his heritage to his family to his tics. 'The key is actually not lying about everything,' Bourdin said. 'Otherwise you'll just mix things up.' He said he adhered to maxims such as 'keep it simple' and 'a good liar uses the truth'. In choosing a name, he preferred one that carried a deep association in his memory, like Cassis. 'The one thing you'd better not forget is your name,' he said.</p> <p>He compared what he did to being a spy: you changed superficial details while keeping your core intact. This approach not only made it easier to convince people; it allowed him to protect a part of his self, to hold on to some moral centre. 'I know I can be cruel, but I don't want to become a monster,' he said.</p> <p>Once he had imagined a character, he fashioned an appropriate appearance: meticulously shaving his face, plucking his eyebrows, using hair-removal creams. He often put on baggy pants and a shirt with long sleeves that swallowed his wrists, emphasising his smallness. Peering in a mirror, he asked himself if others would see what he wanted them to see. 'The worst thing you can do is deceive yourself,' he said.</p> <p>When he honed an identity, it was crucial to find some element of the character that he shared - a technique employed by many actors. 'People always say to me: \"Why don't you become an actor?\"' he told me. 'I think I would be a very good actor, like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone. But I don't want to play somebody. I want to be somebody.'</p> <p>In order to help ease his character into the real world, he fostered the illusion among local authorities that his character actually existed. As he had done in Orthez, he would call a hotline and claim to have seen the character in a perilous situation. The authorities were less likely to grill a child who appeared to be in distress. If someone noticed Bourdin looked oddly mature, however, he did not object. 'A teenager wants to look older,' he said. 'I treat it like a compliment.'</p> <p>Though he emphasised his cunning, he acknowledged that it is not that hard to fool others. People have basic expectations and are rarely on guard for someone to subvert them. By playing on some primal need - vanity, greed, loneliness - men like Bourdin make their marks suspend disbelief. As a result, most cons are filled with logical inconsistencies, even absurdities, which seem humiliatingly obvious after the fact. Bourdin, who generally tapped into a mark's sense of goodness rather than into some darker urge, says: 'Nobody expects a seemingly vulnerable child to be lying.'</p> <p>In October 1997, Bourdin told me, he was at a youth home in Linares, Spain. A child-welfare judge who was handling his case had given him 24 hours to prove he was a teenager; otherwise she'd take his fingerprints, which were on file with Interpol. Bourdin knew that, as an adult with a criminal record, he'd likely face prison. He had already tried to run away once and was caught, and the staff were keeping an eye on his whereabouts. And so he did something that both stretched the bounds of credulity and threatened to transform him into the kind of 'monster' he had insisted he never wanted to become. Rather than invent an identity, he stole one. He assumed the persona of a missing 16-year-old boy from Texas. Bourdin, now 23, not only had to convince the authorities that he was an American child; he had to convince the missing boy's family.</p> <p>According to Bourdin, the plan came to him in the middle of the night: if he could fool the judge into thinking that he was an American, he might be let go. He asked permission to use the telephone in the shelter's office and called the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Alexandria, Virginia, trolling for a real identity. Speaking in English, which he had picked up during his travels, he claimed his name was Jonathan Durean and that he was a director of the Linares shelter. He said a frightened child had turned up who would not disclose his identity but who spoke English with an American accent. Bourdin offered a description of the boy that matched himself - short, slight, prominent chin, brown hair, a gap between his teeth - and asked if the centre had anyone similar in its database. After searching, Bourdin recalls, a woman at the centre said the boy might be Nicholas Barclay, who had been reported missing in San Antonio on 13 June 1994, at the age of 13. Barclay was last seen, according to his file, wearing 'a white T-shirt, purple [trousers], black [trainers] and carrying a pink backpack'.</p> <p>Adopting a sceptical tone, Bourdin says, he asked if the centre could send any more information that it had regarding Barclay. The woman said she would mail overnight Barclay's missing-person flyer and immediately fax a copy as well. After giving her the fax number in the office he was borrowing, Bourdin says, he hung up and waited. At last, a copy of the flyer emerged from the fax machine. The printout was so faint most of it was illegible. Still, the photograph's resemblance to him did not seem that far off. 'I can do this,' Bourdin recalls thinking. He quickly called back the centre, he says, and told the woman: 'I have some good news. Nicholas Barclay is standing right beside me.'</p> <p>Elated, she gave him the number of the officer in the San Antonio police department who was in charge of the investigation. This time pretending to be a Spanish policeman, Bourdin says, he phoned the officer and, mentioning details about Nicholas that he had learned from the woman at the centre - such as the pink backpack - declared the missing child had been found. The officer said he'd contact the FBI and the US Embassy in Madrid. Bourdin had not fully contemplated what he was about to unleash.</p> <p>The next day at the Linares shelter, Bourdin intercepted a package from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children addressed to Jonathan Durean. He ripped open the envelope. Inside was a clean copy of Nicholas Barclay's missing-person flyer. It showed a colour photograph of a small, fair-skinned boy with blue eyes and brown hair so light that it appeared almost blond. The flyer listed several identifying features, including a cross tattooed between Barclay's right index finger and thumb. Bourdin stared at the picture and said to himself: 'I'm dead.' Not only did Bourdin not have the same tattoo, but his eyes and hair were dark brown. In haste, he burned the flyer in the shelter's courtyard, then went into the bathroom and bleached his hair. Finally, he had a friend, using a needle and ink from a pen, give him a makeshift tattoo resembling Barclay's.</p> <p>Still, there was the matter of Bourdin's eyes. He tried to conceive of a story that would explain his appearance. What if he had been abducted by a child sex ring and flown to Europe, where he had been tortured and abused, even experimented on? Yes, that could explain the eyes. His kidnappers had injected his pupils with chemicals. He had lost his Texas accent because, for more than three years of captivity, he had been forbidden to speak English. He had escaped from a locked room in a house in Spain when a guard carelessly left the door open. It was a crazy tale, one that violated his maxim to 'keep it simple', but it would have to do.</p> <p>Soon after, the phone in the office rang. Bourdin took the call. It was Nicholas Barclay's 31-year-old half-sister, Carey Gibson. 'My God, Nicky, is that you?' she asked.</p> <p>Bourdin didn't know how to respond. He adopted a muffled voice, then said: 'Yes, it's me.'</p> <p>Nicholas's mother, Beverly, got on the phone. A tough, heavyset woman with a broad face and dyed-brown hair, she worked the graveyard shift at a Dunkin' Donuts in San Antonio seven nights a week. She had never married Nicholas's father and had raised Nicholas with her two older children, Carey and Jason. (She was divorced from Carey and Jason's father, though she still used her married name, Dollarhide.) A heroin addict, she had struggled during Nicholas's youth to get off drugs. After he disappeared, she had begun to use heroin again and was now addicted to methadone. Despite these difficulties, Carey says, Beverly was not a bad mother: 'She was maybe the most functioning drug addict. We had nice things, a nice place, never went without food.' Perhaps compensating for the instability in her life, Beverly fanatically followed a routine: working at the doughnut shop from 10pm to 5am, then stopping at the Make My Day Lounge to shoot pool and have a few beers before going home to sleep. She had a hardness about her, with a cigarette-roughened voice, but people who know her also spoke to me of her <br>kindness. After her night shift, she delivered any leftover doughnuts to a homeless shelter.</p> <p>Beverly pulled the phone close to her ear. After the childlike voice on the other end said that he wanted to come home, she told me: 'I was dumbfounded and blown away.'</p> <p>Carey, who was married and had two children of her own, had often held the family together during Beverly's struggles with drug addiction. Since Nicholas's disappearance, her mother and brother had never seemed the same, and all Carey wanted was to make the family whole again. She volunteered to go to Spain to bring Nicholas home, and the packing and shipping company where she worked in sales support offered to pay her fare.</p> <p>When she arrived at the shelter, a few days later, accompanied by an official from the US Embassy, Bourdin had secluded himself in a room. What he had done, he concedes, was evil. But if he had any moral reservations they did not stop him, and after wrapping his face in a scarf and putting on a hat and sunglasses he came out of the room. He was sure Carey would instantly realise he wasn't her brother. Instead, she rushed toward him and hugged him.</p> <p>Carey was, in many ways, an ideal mark. 'My daughter has the best heart and is so easy to manipulate,' Beverly says. Carey had never travelled outside the United States, except for partying in Tijuana, and was unfamiliar with European accents and with Spain. After Nicholas disappeared, she had often watched programmes about lurid child abductions. In addition to feeling the pressure of having received money from her company to make the trip, she had the burden of deciding, as her family's representative, whether this was her long-lost brother.</p> <p>Though Bourdin referred to her as 'Carey' rather than 'Sis', as Nicholas always had, and though he had a trace of a French accent, Carey says she had little doubt that it was Nicholas. Not when he could attribute any inconsistencies to his unspeakable ordeal. Not when his nose now looked so much like her uncle Pat's. Not when he had the same tattoo as Nicholas and seemed to know so many details about her family, asking about relatives by name. 'Your heart takes over and you want to believe,' Carey says. She showed Bourdin photographs of the family and he studied each one: this is my mother; this is my half-brother; this is my grandfather.</p> <p>Neither American nor Spanish officials raised any questions once Carey had vouched for him. Nicholas had been gone for only three years, and the FBI was not primed to be suspicious of someone claiming to be a missing child. (The agency told me that, to its knowledge, it had never worked on a case like Bourdin's before.) According to authorities in Madrid, Carey swore under oath that Bourdin was her brother and an American citizen. He was granted a US passport, and the next day was on a flight to San Antonio.</p> <p>For a moment, Bourdin fantasised that he was about to become part of a real family, but halfway to America he began to 'freak out', as Carey puts it, trembling and sweating. </p> <p>As she tried to comfort him, he told her that he thought the plane was going to crash, which, he later said, is what he wanted: how else could he escape from what he had done?</p> <p>When the plane landed, on 18 October 1997, members of Nicholas's family were waiting for him at the airport. Bourdin recognised them from Carey's photographs: Beverly, Nicholas's mother; Carey's then husband, Bryan Gibson; Bryan and Carey's 14-year-old son, Codey, and their 10-year-old daughter, Chantel. Only Nicholas's brother, Jason, who was a recovering drug addict and living in San Antonio, was absent. A friend of the family videotaped the reunion, and Bourdin can be seen bundled up, his hat pulled down, his brown eyes shielded by sunglasses, his already fading tattoo covered by gloves. Though Bourdin had thought that Nicholas's relatives were going to 'hang' him, they rushed to embrace him, saying how much they had missed him. 'We were all just emotionally crazy,' Codey recalls. Nicholas's mother, however, hung back. 'She just didn't seem excited' the way you'd expect from someone 'seeing her son', Chantel told me.</p> <p>Bourdin wondered if Beverly doubted he was Nicholas, but eventually she, too, greeted him. They all got in Carey's car and stopped at McDonald's for cheeseburgers and fries. As Carey recalls it: 'He was just sitting by my mom, talking to my son,' saying how much 'he missed school and asking when he'd see Jason.'</p> <p>Bourdin went to stay with Carey and Bryan rather than live with Beverly. 'I work nights and didn't think it was good to leave him alone,' Beverly said. Carey and Bryan owned a trailer home in a desolate wooded area in Spring Branch, 35 miles north of San Antonio, and Bourdin stared out the window as the car wound along a dirt road, past rusted trucks on cinder blocks and dogs barking at the sound of the engine. As Codey puts it: 'We didn't have no internet or stuff like that. You can walk all the way to San Antonio before you get any kind of communication.'</p> <p>Their cramped trailer home was not exactly the vision of America Bourdin had imagined from movies. He shared a room with Codey and slept on a foam mattress on the floor. Bourdin knew that if he were to become Nicholas and to continue to fool even his family, he had to learn everything about him, and he began to mine information, secretly rummaging through drawers and picture albums, and watching home videos. When Bourdin discovered a detail about Nicholas's past from one family member, he would repeat it to another. He pointed out, for example, that Bryan once got mad at Nicholas for knocking Codey out of a tree. 'He knew that story,' Codey recalls, still amazed by the amount of intelligence Bourdin acquired about the family. Beverly noticed that Bourdin knelt in front of the television, just as Nicholas had. Various members of the family told me that when Bourdin seemed more standoffish than Nicholas or spoke with a strange accent they assumed it was because of the terrible treatment he said he'd suffered.</p> <p>As Bourdin came to inhabit the life of Nicholas, he was struck by what he considered to be uncanny similarities between them. Nicholas had been reported missing on Bourdin's birthday. Both came from poor, broken families; Nicholas had almost no relationship with his father, who for a long time didn't know that Nicholas was his son. Nicholas was a sweet, lonely, combustible kid who craved attention and was often in trouble at school. He had been caught stealing a pair of trainers, and his mother had planned to put him in a youth home. ('I couldn't handle him,' Beverly recalls. 'I couldn't control him.') When Nicholas was young, he was a diehard Michael Jackson fan who had collected all the singer's records and even owned a red-leather jacket like the one Jackson wears in his 'Thriller' video.</p> <p>According to Beverly, Bourdin quickly 'blended in'. He was enrolled in high school and did his homework each night, chastising Codey when he failed to study. He played Nintendo with Codey and watched movies with the family. When he saw Beverly, he hugged her and said, 'Hi, Mom.' Occasionally on Sundays, he attended church with other members of the family. 'He was really nice,' Chantel recalls. 'Really friendly.' Once, when Carey was shooting a home movie of Bourdin, she asked him what he was thinking. 'It's really good to have my family and be home again,' he replied.</p> <p>On 1 November, not long after Bourdin had settled into his new home, Charlie Parker, a private investigator, was sitting in his office in San Antonio. The room was crammed with spy cameras he deployed in the field: one was attached to a pair of eyeglasses, another was lodged inside a fountain pen, and a third was concealed on the handlebars of a bicycle. On a wall hung a photograph that Parker had taken during a stakeout: it showed a married woman with her lover, peeking out of an apartment window. Parker, who had been hired by the woman's husband, called it the 'money shot'.</p> <p>Parker's phone rang. It was a TV producer from the tabloid show Hard Copy who had heard about the extraordinary return of 16-year-old Nicholas Barclay and wanted to hire Parker to help investigate the kidnapping. He agreed to take the job. After Parker spoke with the Hard Copy producer, he easily traced Nicholas Barclay to Carey and Bryan's trailer. On 6 November, Parker arrived there with a producer and a camera crew. The family didn't want Bourdin to speak to reporters. 'I'm a very private person,' Carey says. But Bourdin, who had been in the country for nearly three weeks, agreed to talk. 'I wanted the attention at the time,' he says. 'It was a psychological need. Today I wouldn't do it.'</p> <p>Parker stood off to one side, listening intently as the young man relayed his harrowing story. 'He was calm as a cucumber,' Parker told me. 'No looking down, no body language. None.' But Parker was puzzled by his curious accent.</p> <p>Parker spied a photograph on a shelf of Nicholas Barclay as a young boy, and kept looking at it and at the person in front of him, thinking that something was amiss. Having once read that ears are distinct, like fingerprints, he went up to the cameraman and whispered: 'Zoom in on his ears. Get 'em as close as you can.'</p> <p>Parker slipped the photograph of Nicholas Barclay into his pocket, and after the interview he hurried back to his office and used a scanner to transfer the photo to his computer; he then studied video from the Hard Copy interview. Parker zoomed in on both pictures. 'The ears were close but they didn't match,' he says.</p> <p>Parker called several ophthalmologists and asked if eyes could be changed from blue to brown by injecting chemicals. The doctors said no. Parker also phoned a dialect expert at Trinity University, in San Antonio, who told him that even if someone had been held in captivity for three years, he would quickly regain his native accent.</p> <p>Parker passed on his suspicions to authorities, even though the San Antonio police had declared that 'the boy who came back claiming to be Nicholas Barclay is Nicholas Barclay'. Fearing that a dangerous stranger was living with Nicholas's family, Parker phoned Beverly and told her what he had discovered. As he recalls the conversation, he said: 'It's not him, ma'am. It's not him.'</p> <p>'What do you mean, it's not him?' she asked.</p> <p>Parker explained about the ears and the eyes and the accent. In his files, Parker wrote: 'Family is upset but maintains that they believe it is their son.'</p> <p>Parker says that a few days later he received an angry call from Bourdin. Although Bourdin denies he made the call, Parker noted in his file at the time that Bourdin said: 'Who do you think you are?' When Parker replied that he didn't believe he was Nicholas, Bourdin shot back: 'Immigration thinks it's me. The family thinks it's me.'</p> <p>Parker wondered if he should let the matter go. He had tipped off authorities and was no longer under contract to investigate the matter. He had other cases piling up. And he figured that a mother would know her own son. Still, the boy's accent sounded French, maybe French Moroccan. If so, what was a foreigner doing infiltrating a trailer home in the backwoods of Texas? 'I thought he was a terrorist, I swear to God,' Parker says.</p> <p>Beverly rented a small room in a run-down apartment complex in San Antonio, and Parker started to follow Bourdin when he visited her. 'I'd set up on the apartment and watch him come out,' Parker says. 'He'd walk all the way to the bus stop wearing his Walkman and doing his Michael Jackson moves.'</p> <p>Bourdin was struggling to stay in character. He found living with Carey and Beverly 'claustrophobic' and was happiest when he was outside, wandering the streets. 'I was not used to being in someone else's family, to live with them like I'm one of theirs,' he says. 'I wasn't ready for it.' One day, Carey and the family presented him with a cardboard box. Inside were Nicholas's baseball cards, records and various mementos. He picked up each item, gingerly. There was a letter from one of Nicholas's girlfriends. As he read it, he said to himself: 'I'm not this boy.'</p> <p>After two months in the United States, Bourdin started to come apart. He was moody and aloof - 'weirding out', as Codey put it. He stopped attending classes and was consequently suspended. In December he took off in Bryan and Carey's car and drove to Oklahoma, with the windows down, listening to Michael Jackson's song 'Scream': 'Tired of the schemes / The lies are disgusting... / Somebody please have mercy / 'Cause I just can't take it'. The police pulled him over for speeding, and he was arrested. Beverly, Carey and Bryan picked him up at the police station and brought him home.</p> <p>According to his real mother, Ghislaine, Bourdin called her in Europe. For all his disagreements with his mother, Bourdin still seemed to long for her. (He once wrote her a letter, saying, 'I don't want to lose you... If you disappear then I disappear.') Ghislaine says Bourdin confided that he was living with a woman in Texas who believed that he was her son. She became so upset that she hung up.</p> <p>Shortly before Christmas, Bourdin went into the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror - at his brown eyes, his dyed hair. He grabbed a razor and began to mutilate his face. He was put in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital for several days of observation. Later Bourdin wrote in a notebook: 'When you fight monsters, be careful that in the process you do not become one.' He also jotted down a poem: 'My days are phantom days, each one the shadow of a hope; / My real life never was begun, / Nor any of my real deeds done'.</p> <p>Doctors judged Bourdin to be stable enough to return to Carey's trailer. But he remained disquieted and increasingly wondered what had happened to the real Nicholas Barclay. So did Parker, who, while trying to identify Bourdin, had started to gather information and interview Nicholas's neighbours. At the time that Nicholas disappeared, he was living with Beverly in a small one-storey house in San Antonio. Nicholas's half-brother, Jason, who was then 24, had recently moved in with them after living for a period with his cousin in Utah. Jason was wiry and strong, with long brown curly hair and a comb often tucked in the back pocket of his jeans. He had burn marks on his body and face: at 13 he had lit a cigarette after filling a lawn mower with gasoline and accidentally set himself on fire. Because of his scars, Carey says, 'Jason worried he would never meet somebody and he would always be alone'. He strummed Lynyrd Skynyrd songs on his guitar and was a capable artist who sketched portraits of friends. Though he had only completed high school, he was bright and articulate. He also had an addictive personality, like his mother, often drinking heavily and using cocaine. He had his 'demons', as Carey put it.</p> <p>On 13 June 1994, Beverly and Jason told police that Nicholas had been playing basketball three days earlier and called his house from a pay phone, wanting a ride home. Beverly was sleeping, so Jason answered the phone. He told Nicholas to walk home. Nicholas never made it. Because Nicholas had recently fought with his mother over the trainers he had stolen, and over the possibility of being sent to a home for juveniles, the police initially thought that he had a run away - even though he hadn't taken any money or possessions.</p> <p>Parker was surprised by police reports showing that after Nicholas's disappearance there were several disturbances at Beverly's house. On 12 July she called the police, though when an officer arrived she insisted she was all right. Jason told the officer that his mother was 'drinking and screaming at him because her other son ran away'. A few weeks later, Beverly called the police again, about what authorities described as 'family violence'. The officer on the scene reported that Beverly and Jason were 'exchanging words'; Jason was asked to leave the house for the day, and he complied. On 25 September, police received another call, this time from Jason. He claimed his younger brother had returned and tried to break into the garage, fleeing when Jason spotted him. In his report, the officer on duty said that he had 'checked the area' for Nicholas, but was 'unable to locate him'.</p> <p>Jason's behaviour grew even more erratic. He was arrested for 'using force' against a police officer, and Beverly kicked him out of the house. Nicholas's disappearance, Codey told me, had 'messed Jason up pretty bad. He went on a bad drug binge and was shooting cocaine for a long time.' Because he had refused to help Nicholas get a ride home on the day he vanished, Chantel says, Jason had 'a lot of guilt'.</p> <p>In late 1996 Jason checked into a rehabilitation centre and weaned himself off drugs. After he finished the programme, he remained at the facility for more than a year, serving as a counsellor and working for a landscaping business that the centre operated. He was still there when Bourdin turned up, claiming to be his missing brother.</p> <p>Bourdin wondered why Jason had not met him at the airport and had initially made no effort to see him at Carey's. After a month-and-a-half, Bourdin and family members say, Jason finally came for a visit. Even then, Codey says, 'Jason was standoffish.' Though Jason gave him a hug in front of the others, Bourdin says, he seemed to eye him warily. After a few minutes, Jason told him to come outside, and held out his hand to Bourdin. A necklace with a gold cross glittered in his palm. Jason said that it was for him. 'It was like he had to give it to me,' Bourdin says. Jason put it around his neck. Then he said goodbye, and never returned.</p> <p>Bourdin told me: 'It was clear that Jason knew what had happened to Nicholas.' For the first time, Bourdin began to wonder who was conning who.</p> <p>The authorities, meanwhile, had started to doubt Bourdin's story. Nancy Fisher, who at the time was a veteran FBI agent, had interviewed Bourdin several weeks after he arrived in the United States in order to document his allegations of being kidnapped on American soil. Immediately, she told me, she 'smelled a rat'. 'His hair was dark but bleached blond and the roots were quite obvious.'</p> <p>Parker knew Fisher and had shared with her his own suspicions. Fisher warned Parker not to interfere with a federal probe, but as they conducted parallel investigations they developed a sense of trust, and Parker passed on any information he obtained. When Fisher made inquiries into who may have abducted Nicholas and sexually abused him, she says, she found Beverly oddly 'surly and uncooperative'.</p> <p>Fisher wondered whether Beverly and her family simply wanted to believe that Bourdin was their loved one. Whatever the family's motivations, Fisher's main concern was the mysterious figure who had entered the United States. She knew it was impossible for him to have altered his eye colour. In November, under the pretext of getting Bourdin treatment for his alleged abuse, Fisher took him to see a forensic psychiatrist in Houston, who concluded from his syntax and grammar that he could not be American and was most likely French or Spanish. The FBI shared the results with Beverly and Carey, Fisher says, but they insisted he was Nicholas.</p> <p>Believing Bourdin was a spy, Fisher says, she contacted the Central Intelligence Agency, explaining the potential threat and asking for help in identifying him. 'The CIA wouldn't assist me,' she says. 'I was told by a CIA agent that until you can prove he's European we can't help you.'</p> <p>Fisher tried to persuade Beverly and Bourdin to give blood samples for a DNA test. Both refused. 'Beverly said: \"How dare you say he's not my son,\"' Fisher recalls. In the middle of February, four months after Bourdin arrived in the United States, Fisher obtained warrants to force them to cooperate.</p> <p>'I go to her house to get a blood sample, and she lies on the floor and says she's not going to get up,' Fisher says. 'I said, \"Yes, you are.\"'</p> <p>'Beverly defended me,' Bourdin says. 'She tried to stop them.'</p> <p>Along with their blood, Fisher obtained Bourdin's fingerprints, which she sent to the State Department to see if there was a match with Interpol.</p> <p>Carey, worried about her supposed brother's self-mutilation and instability, was no longer willing to let him stay with her, and he went to live with Beverly in her apartment. By then, Bourdin claims, he looked at the family differently. One time when he was staying with her, Bourdin alleges, she got drunk and screamed: 'I know that God punished me by sending you to me. I don't know who the hell you are. Why the fuck are you doing this?'</p> <p>On 5 March 1998, with the authorities closing in on Bourdin, Beverly called Parker and said she believed Bourdin was an impostor. The next morning, Parker took him to a diner. </p> <p>'I raise my trousers so he can see I'm not wearing a gun [in his ankle holster],' Parker says. 'I want him to relax.'</p> <p>They ordered pancakes. After nearly five months of pretending to be Nicholas Barclay, Bourdin says, he was psychically frayed. According to Parker, when he told 'Nicholas' that he had upset his 'mother', the young man blurted out: 'She's not my mother, and you know it.'</p> <p>'You gonna tell me who you are?'</p> <p>'I'm Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin and I'm wanted by Interpol.'</p> <p>After a few minutes, Parker went to the men's room and called Nancy Fisher with the news. She had just received the same information from Interpol. 'We're trying to get a warrant right now,' she told Parker. 'Stall him.'</p> <p>Parker went back to the table and continued to talk to Bourdin. As Bourdin spoke about his itinerant life in Europe, Parker says, he felt some guilt for turning him in. Bourdin, who despises Parker and disputes the details of their conversation, accuses the detective of 'pretending' to have solved the case; it was as if Parker had intruded into Bourdin's interior fiction and given himself a starring role. After about an hour, Parker drove Bourdin back to Beverly's apartment. As Parker was pulling away, Fisher and the authorities were already descending on him. He surrendered quietly. 'I knew I was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin again,' he says. Beverly reacted less calmly. She turned and yelled at Fisher: 'What took you so long?'</p> <p>In custody, Bourdin told a story that seemed as fanciful as his tale of being Nicholas Barclay. He alleged that Beverly and Jason might have been complicit in Nicholas's disappearance, and that they had known from the outset that Bourdin was lying. 'I'm a good impostor, but I'm not that good,' Bourdin told me.</p> <p>Of course, the authorities could not rely on the account of a pathological liar. 'He tells 99 lies and maybe the 100th is the truth, but you don't know,' Fisher says. Yet the authorities had their own suspicions. Jack Stick, who was a federal prosecutor at the time, was assigned to Bourdin's case. 'I wanted to know what had happened to that little kid,' Stick recalls.</p> <p>Stick and Fisher gathered more evidence suggesting that Beverly's home was prone to violence. They found that officials at Nicholas's school had expressed concern that Nicholas might be an abused child, owing to bruises on his body.</p> <p>One day Fisher asked Beverly to take a polygraph. Carey recalls, 'I said: \"Mom, do whatever they ask you to do. Go take the lie-detector test. You didn't kill Nicholas.\" So she did.' While Beverly was taking the polygraph, Fisher watched the proceedings on a video monitor. The most important question was whether Beverly currently knew the whereabouts of Nicholas. She said no, twice. The polygraph examiner told Fisher that Beverly had seemingly answered truthfully. When Fisher expressed disbelief, the examiner said that if Beverly was lying, she had to be on drugs. After a while, the examiner administered the test again, at which point the effects of any possible narcotics, including methadone, might have worn off. This time, when the examiner asked if Beverly knew Nicholas's whereabouts, Fisher says, the machine went wild, indicating a lie. 'She blew the instruments practically off the table.'</p> <p>When the examiner told Beverly she had failed the exam and began pressing her with more questions, Beverly yelled: 'I don't have to put up with this,' then got up and ran out the door. 'I catch her,' Fisher recalls. 'I say, \"Why are you running?\" She is furious. She says, \"This is so typical of Nicholas. Look at the hell he's putting me through.\"'</p> <p>Fisher next wanted to interview Jason, but he resisted. When he finally agreed to meet her, several weeks after Bourdin had been arrested, Fisher says, she had to 'pull words out of him'. They spoke about the fact that he had not gone to see his alleged brother for nearly two months: 'I said, \"Here's your brother, long gone, kidnapped, and aren't you eager to see him?\" He said, \"Well, no.\" I said, \"Did he look like your brother to you?\" \"Well, I guess.\"' Fisher found his responses grudging, and developed a 'very strong suspicion that Jason had participated in the disappearance of his brother'. Stick, too, believed that Jason either had been 'involved in Nicholas's disappearance or had information that could tell us what had happened'. Fisher even suspected that Beverly knew what had happened to Nicholas and might have helped cover up the crime in order to protect Jason.</p> <p>After the interview, Jason refused to speak to the authorities again without a lawyer or unless he was under arrest. But Parker, who as a private investigator was not bound by the same legal restrictions as Stick and Fisher, continued to press Jason. On one occasion, he accused him of murder. 'I think you did it,' Parker says he told him. 'I don't think you meant to do it, but you did.' In response, Parker says Jason 'just looked at me'.</p> <p>Several weeks after Fisher and Parker questioned Jason, Parker was driving through downtown San Antonio and saw Beverly on the sidewalk. He asked her if she wanted a ride. When she got in, she told him that Jason had died of an overdose of cocaine. Parker, who knew that Jason had been off drugs for more than a year, says that he asked if she thought he had taken his life on purpose. She said, 'I don't know.'</p> <p>Since the loss of her sons, Beverly has stopped using drugs and moved out to Spring Branch, where she lives in a trailer, helping a woman care for her severely handicapped daughter. Recently she agreed to talk with me about the authorities' suspicions. At first Beverly said I could drive out to meet her, but later she told me that the woman she worked for did not want visitors, so we spoke by phone. One of her vocal cords had recently become paralysed, deepening her already low and gravelly voice. Parker, who had frequently chatted with her at the doughnut shop, had told me: 'I don't know why I liked her, but I did. She looked like someone whose life had taken everything out of her.'</p> <p>Beverly answered my questions forthrightly. At the airport, she said, she had hung back because Bourdin 'looked odd'. She added, 'If I went with my gut, I would have known right away.' She admitted she had taken drugs - 'probably' heroin, methadone and alcohol - before the polygraph exam. 'When they accused me, I freaked out,' she said. 'I worked my ass off to raise my kids. Why would I do something to my kids?' She continued: 'I'm not a violent person. They didn't talk to any of my friends or associates... It was just a shot in the dark, to see if I'd admit something.' She also said of herself: 'I'm the world's worst liar. I can't lie worth crap.'</p> <p>I asked her if Jason had hurt Nicholas. She paused for a moment, then said that she didn't think so. She acknowledged that when Jason did cocaine he became 'totally wacko - a completely different person - and it was scary'. He even beat up his father once, she said. But she noted that Jason had not been a serious addict until after Nicholas disappeared. </p> <p>As we spoke, I asked several times how she could have believed for nearly five months that a 23-year-old Frenchman with dyed hair, brown eyes and a European accent was her son. 'We just kept making excuses - that he's different because of all this ugly stuff that had happened,' she said. She and Carey wanted it to be him so badly. It was only after he came to live with her that she had doubts. 'He just didn't act like my son,' Beverly said. 'I couldn't bond with him. I just didn't have that feeling. My heart went out for him, but not like a mother's would. The kid's a mess and it's sad, and I wouldn't wish that on anybody.'</p> <p>Beverly's experience, as incredible as it is, does have a precursor - an incident that has been described as one of 'the strangest cases in the annals of police history'. (It is the basis of a Clint Eastwood movie, Changeling, which will be released in the UK in November.) On 10 March 1928, a nine-year-old boy named Walter Collins disappeared in Los Angeles. Six months later, after a nationwide manhunt, a boy showed up claiming that he was Walter and insisting he had been kidnapped. The police were certain he was Walter, and a family friend testified that 'things the boy said and did would convince anybody' that he was the missing child. When Walter's mother, Christine, went to retrieve her son, however, she did not think it was him. Although the authorities and friends persuaded her to take him home, she brought the boy back to a police station after a few days, insisting: 'This is not my son.' She later testified, 'His teeth were different, his voice was different... His ears were smaller.' The authorities thought that she must be suffering emotional distress from her son's disappearance, and had her institutionalised in a psychiatric ward. Even then, she refused to budge. As she told a police captain, 'One thing a mother ought to know was the identity of her child.' Eight days later, she was released. Evidence soon emerged that her son was likely murdered by a serial killer, and the boy claiming to be her son confessed that he was an 11-year-old runaway from Iowa who, in his words, thought that it was 'fun to be somebody you aren't'.</p> <p>After several months of investigation, Stick determined that there was no evidence to charge anyone with Nicholas's disappearance. There were no witnesses, no DNA. Authorities could not even say whether Nicholas was dead. Stick concluded Jason's overdose had all but 'precluded the possibility' that authorities could determine what had happened to Nicholas.</p> <p>On 9 September 1998, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bourdin stood in a San Antonio courtroom and pleaded guilty to perjury, and to obtaining and possessing false documents. This time, his claim that he was merely seeking love elicited outrage. Carey, who had a nervous breakdown after Bourdin was arrested, testified before his sentencing, saying: 'He has lied, and lied, and lied again. And to this day he continues to lie. He bears no remorse.' Stick denounced Bourdin as a 'flesh-eating bacteria', and the judge compared what Bourdin had done - giving a family the hope that their lost child was alive and then shattering it - to murder.</p> <p>The judge sentenced Bourdin to six years - more than three times what was recommended under the sentencing guidelines. Bourdin told the courtroom: 'I apologise to all the people in my past, for what I have done. I wish, I wish that you believe me, but I know it's impossible.' Whether he was in jail or not, he added, 'I am a prisoner of myself.'</p> <p>When I last saw Bourdin, this spring, his life had undergone perhaps its most dramatic transformation. He had married a Frenchwoman, Isabelle, whom he had met two years earlier. In her late twenties, Isabelle was slim and pretty and soft-spoken. She was studying to be a lawyer.

He said he had never been in a relationship before. 'I've always been a wall,' he said. 'A cold wall.' On 8 August 2007, after a year of courtship, they married at the town hall of a village outside Pau.

A month later, Bourdin called and told me his wife had given birth. </p> <p>'It's a girl,' he said. He and Isabelle had named her Athena, for the Greek goddess.

  "<p>In August 2003, the body of Anthony Hines, a 37-year-old member of Sydney surf gang the Bra Boys, was found at the bottom of cliffs in the suburb of Maroubra. He was naked except for one shoe and had been shot several times in the head. It could have proved a fiddly case for the New South Wales police - trying to find someone without a motive to kill the violent extortionist - but fellow Bra Boy Jai Abberton, then 29, admitted to the killing almost immediately.</p> <p>Two years before, Hines completed a five-year sentence in the town's Long Bay Correction Complex for rape, during which time he had become convinced that Abberton had slept with his long-term girlfriend. Of the two other men Hines suspected of the same deed, one had just been killed and the other beaten to within an inch of his life. On the night of 5 August, Abberton and a female companion, known in court documents as 'BC', were walking to her car near the Coogee Bay Hotel, when Hines sprang from nowhere, forced the pair into the vehicle, took up the front passenger's seat himself and pulled out a gun. 'He'd been a friend of mine since a young age,' Abberton later said. 'So for me, I was spewing that such a good close mate was putting me in a situation like that.'</p> <p>Deciding that Hines was planning for both men to rape the girl - Abberton testified in court that he said: 'We're taking BC back to my house and we're fucking scotching [raping] her' - he began a struggle that culminated in the shooting. Afterwards, Abberton and BC dumped the body at the base of a nearby cliff. No one, least of all the defendant himself, denied that he had pulled the trigger, and so his plea of self-defence rested largely on the fearsome reputation of the victim. 'Anthony Gerard Hines was known widely - and in fact he encouraged this knowledge - as a violent man, a standover man [extortionist] and a rapist,' defence barrister Graham Turnbull told the jury, before moving at least one of them to tears with stories of Hines' cruel behaviour.</p> <p>Jai was in custody on remand for 21 months before the jury acquitted him after just 90 minutes' deliberation - as he emerged from the court, he repeatedly kissed a crucifix and said: 'I always had faith in God.' This period had been made even darker for the family by his brother Koby being charged with accessory to murder after the fact, hindering the police's investigation and attempting to pervert the course of justice. 'Some of my statement was false,' Koby, a professional surfer, later admitted to Surfvillage.com. 'I said that I never seen Jai that night [of Hines' death], but I said that because I just wanted to keep myself away from Jai.' In 2006, Koby was given a nine-month suspended sentence.</p> <p>The family's agonising wait for the verdicts would later make a poignant and compelling focal point to a documentary about the gang called Bra Boys. Perhaps inevitably narrated by Russell Crowe, it has broken box-office records for a documentary in Australia and is now set for release in the UK. Writer and director Sunny Abberton, the oldest of four brothers, had decided long before the murder trial that his family's story would make a great movie. 'Jai's arrest meant we had to make the whole film much more personal, but with definitely no guarantees of a happy ending,' Sunny says. 'But then, we thought, \"Isn't that our lives? Isn't that typical of the story I'm trying to make? The day-to-day struggle of a family in our community? The rise above adversity?\" And so I convinced Jai, \"Look, isn't this exactly what we're trying to show?\"'</p> <p>Seeing his brother's point, Jai continued to participate in the movie but, wary of more controversy, has avoided the media since. Thus, only two of the brothers are at this interview. The 34-year-old Sunny is stocky, eloquent and surprisingly avuncular: no-nonsense bruiser and community-welfare entrepreneur rolled into one. Koby, 29, is one of the world's foremost big-wave surfers (he once beat eight-times world champion Kelly Slater at a showdown in Maroubra) and the gang's pin-up boy: strong jawed with a glassy-eyed insouciance that is complemented nicely by several tattoos bearing the gang's slogan, 'My Brother's Keeper'. Over lunch at a caf\u00e9 in Coogee, metres from where Jai's short but fateful car journey began five years earlier, it becomes ever-more apparent that calling Bra Boys a 'surf-flick' is as over-simplistic as calling The Wire a 'drugs show'.</p> <p>Maroubra - the last syllable of which is key to the gang's name - is an Eora Aboriginal word for 'place of thunder'. It seems appropriate to the Abbertons' turbulent childhood. Their mother, Lynne, was a heroin addict. They have little recollection of their different fathers (although Koby knows his was a bank robber). How aware were they of the dankness of their upbringing? 'I remember being a teenager and me and some mates beating the shit out of mum's drugs dealer,' Sunny says with a laugh. Koby adds: 'I definitely knew heroin was bad and killed you and Mum was addicted to it. I knew what a junkie was, I knew why they were asleep and had shit all over them, and why they were looking terrible. Everyone around us who took heroin was [considered] scum. Older guys at the beach knew what was going on with our mum before we did, and maybe that's why they took us in.'</p> <p>And so, the Abbertons' childhood house quickly lost its status as 'home'. Much of the brothers' time during the Eighties, along with that of scores of other local kids from broken homes, was spent at the nearby home of their grandmother, aka the Bra Boys matriarch or 'Ma'. 'If anyone started Bra Boys, it was Ma,' Koby says in the movie. The rest of their time was spent down at the water, where entry into some kind of gang was inevitable. 'When I was growing up, the beach had seven board-riders' clubs,' Sunny says. 'They were so rough, so localised, fragmented. Australia is really tribal in that way. Go out to the Palace Hotel on a Saturday night and you'll see all these different groups - country boys, visiting footie teams, Aboriginal surfers, mixed race, homeys. Our generation was the first one to kind of bring it all together.'</p> <p>Sunny was inspired to unite the factions in the area by the strong social fabric, spun from deprivation, that he had witnessed in the slums of Brazil and apartheid South Africa in the early Nineties while touring as a junior surf pro. Two decades on, Bra Boys has, he estimates, around 400 members, about 30 of them hardcore, including several top-grade rugby league players - John Sutton, who plays for Russell Crowe's Rabbitohs team, Damon Alley-Tovio, now with Newtown Jets, and Canterbury Bulldogs' Reni Maitua among them. It has all the rites and rigmarole of an organised gang, including a standard-issue tattoo, that good Old Testament slogan, and a masonic-style greeting that, in keeping with their fraternal ethos, involves an affectionate reciprocal clasping of the recipient's upper forearm.</p> <p>Surfing, the brothers say, is the glue that holds together the gang culture. Maroubra, with its vicious rips and jutting rocks, is renowned as one of the city's most technical surf spots; the risks that they took in the water inevitably seem to have crossed over into other areas of life. 'Pushing social boundaries is not new to the boys,' Sunny says in a voiceover segment of the film. 'And it's that same carefree - perhaps careless - attitude that sees the boys push the boundaries in the surf. There's nothing better than being with your brothers and your friends, psyching each other up to see who's going to charge the hardest.' Is it possible the Bra Boys think they're invincible? 'We all grew up trying to go harder in the waves than everyone else,' Koby says. 'So yeah, I got to an elite level, and then realised, \"Fuck, my friends go as hard as these guys if not harder.\"'</p> <p>'When we started to make the film,' says executive producer Michael Lawrence, 'there was a massive riot that lasted three days out inland near Campbelltown [40km south-west of Maroubra]. They were burning their own houses, the riot squad were in there - they were even going to send in the military. So Sunny said, \"I want to send a camera crew out there because that's what happens when you have nothing - that's what Koby and I could've ended up like. We could've been those kids. The ocean saved us.\" The only reason we didn't go and film was it was too dangerous.'</p> <p>I ask both brothers separately what would have become of them if they had had the same childhood, but inland - say, in a similar suburb of Melbourne or Brisbane. The answer they give is, word for word, identical: 'Dead or in jail.' 'I see that everywhere I travel in the world,' Koby says. 'People who have been going through the same stuff we did are normally already in jail.' It's telling that the film concludes with an RIP montage. 'Those guys died in jail, drug overdoses, some were stabbed, shot - we wanted to end by showing the ones that hadn't made it through,' Sunny says.</p> <p>After lunch, Sunny and Koby take a wander around Maroubra. It's a bitterly cold, stormy day, but Koby appears warmed by beer and nostalgia, peacocking happily around, nonchalantly throwing a beer bottle he has just drained into a hedge and reminiscing about his youthful career as a minor vandal with pride. The brothers are obviously close - they have been ever since Koby came to live with Sunny after being hit in the head by a baseball bat wielded by their mother's boyfriend of the time - and their banter is playful:</p> <p>Koby: 'I was at the circus the other night, and thought the clown was going to call me up on stage. I was scared fucking shitless. I'm not scared of 50-foot swells, but I hate those fucking clowns, mate.'</p> <p>Sunny: 'You didn't mind in New York when they pulled you up on stage with those strippers.'</p> <p>Koby: 'That story should stop there...'</p> <p>They pause at a modest redbrick bungalow. 'This is where our mother lived,' Sunny says. As they pose for the camera on the porch, glad to be briefly out of the rain, the current occupant opens the door to check who the intruders are. He clocks who is occupying his doorstep then departs with some furious, obsequious nods of consent. </p> <p>The wind-and-rain-lashed suburb we are touring is the setting of what Sunny calls 'The Struggle', which goes right back to the earliest days of white settlement in Australia. Maroubra is only five bays south of the flush, flash beach-burb Bondi, yet it has continually managed to dodge the shower of wealth that has befallen Sydney's coastal Eastern Suburbs, almost from Captain Cook's arrival in 1770. As Crowe's narration explains in Bra Boys, 100 years after the First Fleet landed, the area's impoverished settlers were forced to live in caves and beach shacks, along with the Aborigines. In 1930, up to 1,000 families were moved from these camps to stark, imposing, government housing. Since then a sewage works, a rifle range and Australia's largest prison - Long Bay, which sits atop a hill in full view of potential inmates - have sprung up to make Maroubra a carbuncle on an otherwise idyllic stretch of coast. 'That's the uniqueness of Maroubra,' Sunny says. 'Next to all this terrible infrastructure we have the ocean, which taught us respect and pushing your body and so on.'</p> <p>It is a place where poverty, domestic turbulence and crime have always seemed to feed each other. 'There's been tension with the police in this area for over 100 years,' Sunny says. 'The first convicts, the early colonisation years - they're our ancestors. Maroubra was the first place where Aboriginals were banned from going in the sea, and much later the counterculture surf movement started because the council passed laws that banned surfing.' He breaks into a giggle. 'The authorities decided to make surfers wear skirts, but larrikins started turning up in bonnets and bows - that law was soon dropped.'</p> <p>Their distrust of authority, which has simmered ever since, boiled over on 22 December 2002 with an incident that features prominently in the movie. That night, professional surfer and Bra Boy Mark Matthews was celebrating his 21st birthday with 300 friends at the Coogee-Randwick RSL Club. On the floor above, two or three hundred off-duty officers from the Waverley Police Force were holding their own Christmas party. It was a volatile mix and, while no one can agree on who lit the touchpaper, the melee that broke out was big enough to draw helicopters, police dogs and riot squads. By the end of it, more than 30 officers were injured.</p> <p>Sunny is incandescent about the media coverage of the incident. 'The press didn't hear about that fight until four days after,' he says, 'because none of the phone calls police made went through the emergency number - they were all from personal mobile phones to other personal mobile phones between the police. They were trying to cover it up, because it was an event where police officers were drinking. Then, there was huge publicity about the eight Bra Boys arrested, but nothing the day that eight were found not guilty.' Police said there were 80 officers at the party by the time of the incident and that they had been unable to call the emergency services. One Bra Boy admitted assault. Rugby league's Reni Maitua had his conviction for assault overturned when the appeal judge found conflicting evidence. No police were charged or reprimanded.</p> <p>Bra Boy John Gannon, meanwhile, says that 'it was just a good old-fashioned brawl' with 'no knives and no guns pulled... It was a fight, we won, and they were licking their wounds.' </p> <p>'People weren't convicted,' says Matthews, 'but it was still costing friends of mine A$30,000 [\u00a314,000] to go to court. They were losing deposits for their home loans, but everyone acts like we got off scot free.' </p> <p>The Bra Boys came off better in the media, however, during the race riots on Sydney's Cronulla Beach around Christmas 2005. The gang mediated in talks between the white-supremacist mobs and the mostly Lebanese 'outsiders' from whom they wanted to 'reclaim the beaches', as their sinister tagline went. Sunny was glad of the chance for the Bra Boys to demonstrate their take on race. 'The papers, prior to us telling our story, were vilifying us as a white Anglo-Saxon racist gang,' he says. 'I mean, they were saying that migrants and ethnic people had been beaten in the area, Asian shopkeepers beaten on the beach - all absolute bullshit. That runs against the whole ethics of what we are, who we are.' Koby adds: 'Like, out west and stuff, you don't get different crews hanging with each other. Maybe it's the same in England. There's not many places where you get black and white guys, 300 of them together, and you know, all loving each other.' </p> <p>The Bra Boys documentary is a chronological retelling of the gang's evolution: talking-heads interviews with members, spliced with archive amateur footage, street battle re-enactment and big-wave action, soundtracked by the obligatory power-chord rap-rock. Critical reactions to it in Australia were polarised, as epitomised by Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton, presenters of the influential ABC show At The Movies. While Stratton was suspicious of the movie being directed by one of its own subjects and deemed it amateurish, Pomeranz thought the subject matter gritty and captivating enough to overlook the accusations that the film was unpolished or self-serving. Either way, it became the most commercially successfully Australian documentary ever following its local release in 2006.</p> <p>The film generated enough media buzz for the gang to become regulars in the tabloids. The headlines tend to be innocuous these days - a successful campaign to rid Maroubra beach front of parking meters, so that the poor can continue to use the beach; rumours of Koby dating Tara Reid (true) and Paris Hilton (shaky), and the brothers giving the latter an impromptu surf lesson on Malibu Beach. But they show no sign of letting up - and Jai's recent suspended sentence for his sixth offence of driving while disqualified probably did not help.</p> <p>Their recent promotional tour in the States saw Koby and Sunny lord it up with Hollywood's glitterati, who apparently saw these rough-at-heel Aussies, with their movie already made and nobody to impress in pursuit of funding, as a breath of fresh air. They made such an impact on the stogie-smokers in the big studios that a Hollywood adaptation of the Bra Boys' story is reportedly in the pipeline, with Mark Wahlberg touted to play Koby and Russell Crowe himself considering the role of Anthony Hines. </p> <p>As for their personal lives, their mother has finally put heroin behind her ('It's only been in the last year that we've been able to sit down and have dinner and a glass of wine together - first time in 25 years,' Sunny says). But despite the film's success, the brothers still find themselves in financial hardship. 'We went bankrupt after the court case,' Koby says. </p> <p>Sunny elaborates: 'We lost three properties, including our grandma's place that she'd worked two jobs all her life for. Koby lost his main sponsor, too.' Koby is also grappling with a charge of assaulting an off-duty police officer in Hawaii - a charge he denies - and, according to the Australian tabloids, repeated rejections of his marriage proposals by his model girlfriend, Tahyna Tozzi. In an attempt to raise funds, the Abbertons have launched a clothing line called MyBrothersKeeper, with fans of the range sometimes known as MBK Soldiers.</p> <p>Still, these are probably the happiest times in the brothers' lives to date. On a sunnier day than today, they and their mates would be board-shorted up and, high on solar rays and Toohey's New, partying hard - which, judging by some of the movie footage, means turning themselves into human infernos and jumping from lofty rock platforms into the sea, sliding lit bangers into mates' bum-cracks, wrestling each other dressed in giant cornflake boxes and diving into wheelie-bins filled with ice and lager. It seems that the spirit of the Bra Boys is unquenchable.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Bra Boys documentary opens in selected cinemas later this month</p>",
  "<p>Raven's Pass finally gained a Group One win with a splendid performance to beat his old rival Henrythenavigator a length in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, giving trainer John Gosden and jockey Jimmy Fortune a notable double at the highest level, with youngster Rainbow View decisively taking the Fillies' Mile an hour or so earlier.</p> <p>Perhaps Gosden was exercising a degree of caution when he suggested in the press last week that the event was to be a stepping stone to the Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita - 'Raven's Pass has not been drilled for this race, in the sense that a planned date at the end of October is of more keen interest' - but his big colt gave the appearance in the paddock of one at the peak of his powers. By contrast, Henrythenavigator was sweating and French challenger Tamayuz did not look in the same league as Raven's Pass, even though he had a verdict over him in France in July.</p> <p>Gosden put that defeat down to 'giving the winner a 12-length start' and also thought with the benefit of hindsight that the tactics had been wrong in the narrow defeat by Henrythenavigator in the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. Yesterday, it all slotted into place, with Fortune - who took the blame for the Sussex defeat - tracking Tamayuz in fourth place as the two pacemakers blazed off at a crazy pace.</p> <p>In the straight, Raven's Pass was able to gain first run on his old rival and, though Henrythenavigator bravely tried to pull alongside him at the furlong pole, he drew away near the finish for a length win. The runner-up had had a rush to reach the course with fog delaying his flight from Ireland and he was blowing hard after the race.</p> <p>After Raven's Pass finished third to New Approach in last year's Dewhurst, Sheikh Mohammed bought a share in him as well as buying the winner, who went on to land the Derby in the colours of his wife, Princess Haya.</p> <p>Raven's Pass was wearing those - perhaps they can be thought of as lucky - green and black silks for the first time here, following the Sheikh's purchase of former owners Stonerside Stable's racing premises in Kentucky.</p> <p>Rainbow View is still American owned and George Strawbridge had made the journey from Pennsylvania to see his filly cement her position at the head of the market for the 1,000 Guineas. For the first time in her short career, Rainbow View had to battle on her way to overcoming a tough opponent in Fantasia. She is on the small side, but, like Raven's Pass, looks likely to have a Breeder's Cup race on her agenda. As her trainer pointed out, and those tempted to back her at 2-1 for Newmarket should note: 'We've got to get through all of the winter and all of the spring.'</p> <p>Eight years ago, Gosden achieved this double with Observatory and Crystal Music, and, though he was not sounding like a man ready to rest on his laurels, he said: 'I have a sense of relief about the filly and a sense of elation about Raven's Pass.'</p> <p>The best bet on today's Ascot card is <strong>Mister Dee Bee</strong> in the nursery at 3.50. He showed an impressive turn of foot when beating a small group on the wrong side of the course in his first handicap at Doncaster last time and should again beat Cook's Endeavour, who raced in the bigger stands' side section, while taking advantage of the weight concession from Secrecy, who looks the main danger.</p> <p>I could have six goes at picking the winner of the Diomed Stakes and not be confident of success. Dark Missile runs the course well and is drawn near front-running Lesson In Humility. King's Apostle has a first-rate chance on his Stewards' Cup second, while Assertive, Edge Closer, Balthazaar's Gift, Sir Gerry, Zidane and Diabolical all have claims. In the end, <strong>Prime Defender</strong> (3.15) is the choice after a good effort at Doncaster.</p> <p><strong>Young Mick</strong> (2.05) ran no sort of race last time, yet so troubled was his passage when fifth at Newbury the time before he should be given another chance at a track where he has four wins in eight runs.</p> <p><strong>Sugar Ray</strong> (2.40) is the only confirmed front-runner in the small field for the Cumberland Lodge Stakes so may be able to spring a surprise wearing a visor for the first time. Fortune should be able to take his horse straight into the lead and dictate the pace he wants to, whereas the other quartet may spend too much time looking at each other. In similar circumstances at Royal Ascot, Sugar Ray was able to bag the Duke of Edinburgh Handicap.</p> <p>At Market Rasen, <strong>Insignia</strong> (4.00) reverts to hurdles after decent efforts in chases, including a fifth in a valuable event at Newton Abbot off a mark 13lb higher than today. He was a close third to well-handicapped Eden Linty off this rating at Chepstow last season.</p> <p>Marcus Tregoning has his horses in good form and <strong>Hall Hee</strong> can make the long trip to Musselburgh pay off in the 4.10.

Unfortunately, the average time for a helicopter rescue crew to arrive on the scene is 45 minutes, which gives you less than a 30 per cent likelihood of making it out alive. </p> <p>These kind of odds are at the forefront of my mind when I find myself buried up to my neck in snow on a remote slope somewhere in western Austria - even though it is only part of a training demonstration and help is readily to hand. The experience is still sobering and, if I'm honest, slightly scary.</p> <p>One cubic metre of snow weighs 500kg and the feeling of helplessness engendered by having it piled on top of you is enough to induce rapid panic. Worse, trying to fight your way free - which feels like a rational response to such a situation - will only make things more fraught. While kicking and shoving creates marginally more space for you in the snow, in the thinner atmosphere of the mountains it proves quickly exhausting. And with each breath you take between exertions, the snow collapses further into the cavity around your body: the more you struggle for freedom the more surely you'll entomb yourself. By the time I am dug free only a few minutes have passed, but I am eager not to repeat the exercise. It is a salutary reminder that we place ourselves in inherent danger each time we venture into the mountains.</p> <p>So far this year, 100 people have been killed by avalanches in the Alps, making this one of the worst years in Europe since the 'Winter of Terror' in 1951, when 649 separate avalanches over three-months in Austria and Switzerland killed 265 people, laying waste to dozens of towns and villages and burying thousands of acres of forest under snow and rubble. </p> <p>The Snow and Avalanche Awareness Camp programme was launched in Austria in 1997 in the hope of reducing the annual death toll. The camps, open to anyone aged over 14, take place on weekends at 16 resorts across western Austria including Mayrhofen, K\u00fchtai and Westendorf and are free - in the hope of encouraging participation, especially among young skiers and snowboarders who are thought to be least likely to heed the hazard signs posted on the edge of the piste. Tuition, day lift passes and specialist equipment are all included, courtesy of corporate sponsors and the regional tourist board. Although it is aimed primarily at Germans and Austrians, anyone can take part and the tutors speak excellent English.</p> <p>I join a small group at Mayrhofen. We begin with a morning of theory in which Robbie Schellander, our guide, talks us through the basic science of avalanches and the common risks involved in going off-piste. He also punctures a few of the more prevalent myths on the subject. So, for the record, I can now report that while avalanches can't be triggered by shouting (the sound waves aren't strong enough to do so) you will not save yourself from one by ducking behind a tree. Trees bend or snap in the face of an avalanche and they can actually help cause them by acting as points of weakness in the packed snow on a mountain slope.</p> <p>In the afternoon, Robbie leads us away from the piste. We take out our collapsible shovels from our rucksacks and dig down until we reach the wet earth and grass beneath, exposing a metre high face of snow. Robbie points out the different strata it contains, including a 15cm tier of soft powder sandwiched between two layers of more densely packed snow.</p> <p>On a steeper slope higher up the mountain, such conditions could lead to an avalanche if the powder layer, unable to bond to the harder snow beneath, were to slide off down the mountain, taking the slab of denser, surface layer snow with it. This type of 'slab avalanche' is the most common form of snowslide, though there are others caused by wind, steep terrain and temperature. But the camp's main lesson is that all avalanches are potentially lethal and best avoided.</p> <p>The camps are about learning to spot the danger signs on a mountain: a ridge bearing a teetering wind lip of snow; a patch of glimmering powder whose ostensibly inviting surface is the only clue to the unstable layers of snow beneath it; the 'hot spots' that can set off manifold fissures across a slope like cracks in a mirror as you ski over them.</p> <p>We also learn what equipment to carry and how to use it if we get into trouble. Above all, that means wearing a transceiver that sends out a constant radio signal of your location and can also pick up that signal from other nearby devices. If you are skiing with a group and only one is left standing after an avalanche, the transceiver could lead them to their buried colleagues. </p> <p>While the programme advocates the importance of safety and preparation, it also stresses the sheer joy of escaping the crowded slopes and heading - with due precaution - deep into untrammelled off-piste terrain. On our last afternoon, we hike up a mountain ridge and stand looking into an empty valley below. From there, we can see the potential danger areas on the mountain face and even the sites of recent small avalanches. We follow a narrow line to avoid disturbing a heavy, steep bank of snow directly below us and drop into solitude and silence, the slope before us untouched and inviting.</p> <p>Overhead, a thin ribbon of cloud drifts across the empty blue sky. On the mountain, nothing moves. For a moment at least, it feels that there is nothing on the Earth to fear.</p> <p>\u2022 Ekow Eshun travelled to Mayrhofen with Inghams (020 8780 4447; <a href=\"http://www.inghams.co.uk\">inghams.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>Novels about migrants are everywhere at present. In the past few months, Aleksander Hemon, Eva Hoffmann and Chris Cleave have all published books with migrant protagonists, and earlier this year Rose Tremain won the Orange Prize for The Road Home, her tale of an Eastern European economic migrant to Britain. Most of these writers can be said to approach the subject with optimism, in that they believe that the goal of making a successful life in a new country is eminently achievable. It's a view that is encouraged by the present-day reality of mass migration, as well as by the other accoutrements of globalisation. Thanks to travel, the internet and satellite television, the boundaries between countries seem more permeable than they used to, and these days when you move abroad you can take many aspects of your old life with you. </p> <p>It remains possible, though, to doubt whether migration can ever be a wholly successful enterprise, and this is broadly what Alaa al Aswany does in his new novel, Chicago. Like his last book, The Yacoubian Building, Chicago is an up-close portrait of an Egyptian community, although this time its members are not the residents of a Cairo apartment block but the students and faculty members of the University of Illinois Medical Centre. Chicago features almost as many characters as The Yacoubian Building did, and once again al Aswany charts their interlinked lives with impressive skill. As has often been pointed out, he is a rather old-fashioned writer, relying on well-crafted storylines and strongly defined characters. No doubt this has something to do with the wide appeal of his work, which sells well in both the Islamic world and the West. </p> <p>This is, however, an altogether darker, less straightforward and more problematic work than its predecessor. By shifting the location to America, al Aswany asks questions of his characters - all but a handful of whom are Egyptian - not demanded of those in The Yacoubian Building. To what extent is the immigrant obliged to remain loyal to his or her old country? Can people ever really cast off the identities into which they were born and become fully paid-up members of a new society? </p> <p>There is nothing trivial about such questions; you could say that the harmoniousness of much of the post-9/11 world depends on their answers. America, a nation of immigrants, is founded on the belief that old attachments can be transcended, whereas Islamic cultures tend to demand a strict obedience of their subjects that persists even when they move overseas. In presenting us with the collision of these two standpoints, al Aswany has written a novel that, if nothing else, feels extremely timely. </p> <p>His characters range in age from early twenties to late sixties, and they meet the challenges of their American life in different ways. At one extreme is Ra'fat Thabit, a professor of medicine, who sees everything about Egypt as 'backward' and has made it his ambition to be 'a complete genuine American, pure and without blemish'. At the other is Danana, the youngish head of the Egyptian Student Union in America, who plays the part of dedicated student while acting as a spy for the Egyptian secret police.</p> <p>Other characters attempt, perhaps more honestly, to inhabit the middle ground. There's Shaymaa, a talented medic from a humble background who falls in love with a fellow student and gradually abandons the strict sexual codes of her upbringing. And there's Nagi, a roguish dissident who embraces the sexual freedoms of America while taking every opportunity to plot the downfall of the Egyptian government. </p> <p>What none of the characters achieves, however, is a satisfactory balance between their Egyptian and American selves. Those who move too far away from their roots pay a heavy price: Ra'fat Thabit's only daughter shacks up with a drug addict, while Shaymaa gives up her virginity to a boyfriend who has no intention of marrying her. Those who cleave to their Egyptian identities don't fare any better: Danana's front of studiousness, for example, is exposed when his professor discovers he has cheated on a research project.</p> <p>Chicago's frequently light tone disguises the overall pessimism of its vision. The book suggests there is no real possibility of successfully transcending the cultural divide; national identities are fixed and impermeable. Any Egyptian who attempts to 'become' American will be condemned to an unhappy life. </p> <p>Al Aswany is perfectly entitled to these views, and he is correct to suggest that immigration is always a struggle. But the pessimism of the novel feels false in one respect, and this has to do with the way in which he presents America. While his understanding of Egyptian culture is subtle and nuanced, his understanding of America is crude. When he ventures beyond the confines of his Egyptian community, he often gets things comically wrong. One scene shows a black woman being publicly subjected to the kind of racism that was no longer possible in Martin Luther King's day; when another character takes a single line of cocaine, this instantly means she is an 'addict'. This is the world of bad Hollywood movies and anti-American propaganda, not of real life.</p> <p>Al Aswany is a realist novelist and so his work depends on us believing that what he is writing is in some sense true, or at least plausible. If one aspect of his vision is unrealistic, that jeopardises the entire edifice. But more than this, al Aswany's presentation of America detracts from his mostly subtle and humane analysis of the big themes his novel grapples with. If you are going to take on the 'clash of civilisations', then it seems important to give both sides of the clash a fair hearing. By depicting America in such a caricatured way, al Aswany makes the gulf between Islam and the West seem even wider than it is.</p>",
  "<p>When I first met Ulrike Meinhof, before she took up the gun, I thought her tender and vulnerable. As The Observer's correspondent in Germany, I had gone to interview her in Hamburg for a left-wing view of the poverty and exploitation hidden behind the shiny 'economic miracle'. I found her in a suburban house, a nervous, pretty woman of 30 with two blonde little girls rolling round her feet.</p> <p>At that time - it was 1964 - she was editing the political journal konkret, and already making a name as one of Germany's most eloquent columnists. Politically, she was a pacifist and committed to the nuclear disarmament campaign, like her strong-minded, idealistic foster mother, Renate Riemeck, who had adopted Meinhof and her sister after the death of their parents.</p> <p>After the interview, we talked a bit. She was having trouble, she confessed, with the Socialist Students' League (SDS), which was trying to cast her out for lack of Marxist vigour. They despised her pacifism. 'They call me a peace-loving egg-pancake,' she said sadly. Both of us agreed that some sort of revolt was brewing, especially in the universities.</p> <p>But neither of us guessed that three years later the SDS would lead a revolutionary upsurge which would shake the state's foundations. Least of all did I - or she - imagine that this shy, self-critical person would become an international symbol of violence when that upsurge weakened and she found herself leading the most feared terrorist group in Germany, responsible for 47 deaths.</p> <p>In 1968, she left her husband and her good job, and moved to Berlin. I was living there, and a message came from Riemeck asking me through a mutual friend to 'keep an eye on Ulrike, because she'll be lonely'. I never got round to looking her up. But she was meeting far more exciting company: Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, who had already been convicted for setting fire to a department store ('the Vietnam experience').</p> <p>Counselling girl delinquents, Ulrike became convinced that they were victims of the system who should be trained to fight and smash it, not to adapt to it. Soon afterwards, when Baader was re-arrested in 1970, Meinhof planned and took part in a daring shoot-out to rescue him and herself went underground.</p> <p>Ensslin urged her to get rid of the children, both then still aged under 10. After first refusing, she gave in. They were spirited out of Germany and dumped in a hippy commune in Sicily. She did not see them again until they visited her in prison two years later.</p> <p>Last weekend, the audience trickling out of Cologne's biggest cinema looked shattered. Earlier, as they waited to see the premiere of The Baader-Meinhof Complex, they had been in high spirits: the city's young, sparky, arthouse mob laughing and sipping white wine.</p> <p>In the cinema, their happy mood drained away. Two-and-a-half hours later, as the credits began to roll, there was at first silence and then only quiet, stunned applause.</p> <p>The film itself is powerful, showing the foul reality of urban guerrilla struggle and what it does to its victims and its perpetrators. But the myth of the Baader-Meinhof group is powerful too, still haunting German imaginations more than a generation later. The young people who see the film now were not born when it all happened. And yet the German past now intrigues them, in contrast to the deliberate deafness of their parents to their own recent history. Other films with a historical basis - Downfall and The Lives of Others - have pulled big attendances.</p> <p>That Cologne audience, utterly opposed to terrorist violence, nonetheless felt a pang of sympathy with the protagonists. Thirty years ago, would they have turned away those terrorist boys and girls if they had come begging for shelter? Would they have called the police?</p> <p>This film provides no easy answers. Many Germans seem to find it admirable, including - surprisingly - the children of some of the gang's victims. Others are outraged, seeing it as a glamorisation of terror. One right-wing critic said bitterly: 'It doesn't clear away the myth... It gives it a new foundation'.</p> <p>The roots of the Baader-Meinhof group (the 'Red Army Faction' or RAF) were in the revolutionary student movement which swept West Berlin and West Germany between 1967 and 1969. While the movement acted mainly through mass demonstrations, permitting only 'symbolic counter-violence against objects', its rage against the American war in Vietnam ('genocide') was incandescent.</p> <p>So was its hatred of the West German state, an economic triumph which had preserved suffocatingly authoritarian structures in the universities and not least in the police, trained to regard all protest as Communist subversion.</p> <p>In West Berlin, I soon began to meet angry young militants who thought that the student movement should stop waving posters at the state and attack it physically. Events soon gave them force. I was there on 2 June 1967, at a demonstration against the Shah of Persia, when the police ran wild and shot dead the student Benno Ohnesorg. And I remember the tears of impotent fury and grief all around me when Rudi Dutschke, the Danton of the SDS, was gunned down by a hyped-up boy screaming 'Communist swine!'</p> <p>So it seemed that there was already a war on. To take up arms against the imperialist killers, to act and fight, seemed to some like an ethical response.</p> <p>One of these radicals was Andreas Baader, an unstable tearaway with devastating charisma and a taste for violence. Born in 1943, he had lost his father in the war and grew up a spoiled child bullying a household of women. As a teenager, he stole motorbikes, wrecked cars and enjoyed pub brawls. In 1963 he moved to West Berlin to avoid military service, became involved in the 'bohemian' political scene and acquired a taste for natty dressing unusual in that milieu. Here he met his true love, the extraordinary Gudrun Ensslin.</p> <p>Daughter of a deeply serious and compassionate Lutheran minister in Swabia, herself highly intelligent and socially conscious, she spent a year at a Methodist college in America, where she was shocked into radical socialist politics.</p> <p>Back in West Berlin, she became totally disillusioned with the ruling Social Democrats and with all conventional morality. In 1968 she met Baader, went fire-bombing stores with him and landed in jail. It was in prison that she met Ulrike Meinhof, who had come to interview her.</p> <p>The culmination of that friendship was the 1970 springing of Andreas Baader. Afterwards the gang, now growing in numbers, went to Lebanon for military training with Palestinian guerrillas. Back in Germany, the shooting war began with a series of spectacular bank raids and clashes with the police, In May 1972 came lethal bomb attacks on American army bases, once accepted as West Germany's defence against Soviet invasion but now seen as integral to the hated Vietnam war. German prosecutors and right-wing newspaper offices were also targets.</p> <p>By now, the 'Baader-Meinhof Gang' was obsessing West German politicians and dominating the media. There were deaths - American soldiers, German policemen and the first Red Army Faction victim: Petra Schelm. She was only one of many young women fighting in the group and leading its 'commandos'.</p> <p>Around the group, there was soon a wide 'sympathiser' network of people who shared the RAF aims, even though they rejected their terrorist methods. Opinion polls showed that one in four West Germans under 30 felt 'a certain sympathy'. In liberal northern Germany, one in 10 was prepared to shelter a RAF fugitive.</p> <p>Soon after the bombings, in June 1972, the police's luck changed. They cornered Andreas Baader and two of his comrades in a Hamburg garage; Baader was wounded and captured. A week later, Ensslin was caught in a Hamburg boutique. The ruthless Brigitte Mohnhaupt was arrested in Berlin and Meinhof was betrayed by her host in a Hanover flat.</p> <p>Baader, Ensslin and Meinhof, with several other RAF fighters, ended up in a specially constructed super-prison at Stammheim, near Stuttgart. But meanwhile the 'second wave' RAF went into action. In April 1975, they stormed the West German embassy in Stockholm, took hostages and demanded the release of the Stammheim prisoners.</p> <p>The siege ended in carnage and failure. The following month, the trial of the Stammheim three, plus Jan-Carl Raspe, began its chaotic and often farcical three-year course. But Meinhof did not see the end of it. Tormented by a sense of failure, and bullied for weakness by Baader and Ensslin, she hanged herself in May 1976.</p> <p>Outside, the 'second wave' was preparing a new campaign, after a group had undergone training in South Yemen. And in 1977 they launched the crescendo of horror and tragedy which is now remembered as 'the German Autumn' - although it began in spring.</p> <p>In April, the chief federal prosecutor, Siegfried Buback, and his bodyguard were killed by motorcycle gunmen (or possibly women) as their car waited at traffic lights. On 30 July, the banker J\u00fcrgen Ponto was fatally wounded by Brigitte Mohnhaupt and Christian Klar in a bungled kidnap attempt, meant to spring the Stammheim survivors. On 5 September, the gang successfully abducted Hanns-Martin Schleyer, chairman of the employers' federation, after killing his driver and escorts.</p> <p>Again, they demanded the release of the prisoners and a plane to fly them to the Middle East. The government stalled. Mohnhaupt persuaded Palestinian militants to hijack a Lufthansa jet. It was done, but no country in the region would accept the plane, which eventually landed at Mogadishu in Somalia. There, on 17 October, it was stormed by German special forces and the passengers released.</p> <p>Next morning, Baader, Ensslin and Raspe were found dead in their cells. The two men had apparently shot themselves with smuggled pistols; Ensslin had hanged herself. A fourth prisoner, Irmgard M\u00f6ller, had stab wounds but survived.</p> <p>Two days later, Schleyer was taken to a wood on the Dutch/German border and executed. Baader, Ensslin and Raspe were buried in Stuttgart among emotional crowds raising clenched fists. For years, the orthodoxy of the German far left insisted that they and Meinhof had been murdered in their cells. Some still believe it.</p> <p>That is where the film ends. But the book by Stefan Aust on which it is based, a revised edition with the same title as the film, takes the story further. The Stammheim deaths were not quite the end of the RAF. Some of them took refuge in East Germany, where they were protected and given new identities by the Stasi. In the 1980s, another string of murders began, targeting mostly industrialists and bankers.</p> <p>It was not until 1998 that the authorities received a bulletin announcing that the urban guerrilla movement was over. The communiqu\u00e9 ended with the words: 'The Revolution says: I was, I am, I will be'....</p> <p>So why are they remembered so acutely, these intelligent young men and women who turned to terrorism? Why did that Cologne audience creep out into the autumn night looking as if they had been mugged? In Britain, such people would be regarded as mere criminals, their gun-slinging career not without glamour but their political ideas of no possible interest. In Germany, even 40 years on, it is different.</p> <p>There is a whole shelf of older movies about Baader-Meinhof, most of them elegiac and to some degree defensive. The Baader-Meinhof Complex sets out neither to condemn or excuse. The method adopted by producer Bernd Eichinger (Oscar-nominated for his work on Downfall) is to throw at the viewer one astonishing scene after another without stringing them together into some psychological narrative. He calls this technique Fetzendramaturgie - the drama of fragments. You and I can put the fragments together into any pattern we please.</p> <p>The main characters - Baader, Ensslin and Meinhof - are allowed to say what they actually did say , especially at the outset of their campaign. And what they said is now repeated with all the professional skill and force of some of Germany's best actors. And the result - an unnerving one - is that the arguments begin to convince.</p> <p>Here sit these nice Cologners from a liberal, reunited, 21st-century Germany, safe inside the eurozone. And yet as they listen to Martina Gedeck as Ulrike Meinhof or Johanna Wokalek as Gudrun Ensslin, they find themselves tempted to agree that they had no alternative but to take up arms.</p> <p>And then the logic leads down into darkness, into places where arguments are no longer about noble ends but about whether you can harden yourself to use terrible means. Meinhof relied much on words by Bertolt Brecht: 'If you could change the world at last/ What would be beneath you? .../ Sink in the dirt,/ Embrace the slaughterer./ But change the world; the world needs it.'</p> <p>They certainly embraced the slaughterers. After those first seven years of urban guerrilla war, 47 people were dead, including most of the group's original members. They sank in the dirt: the murders, especially those in the final 'autumn', had a quality of forced viciousness about them, a revelry in blood, which is truly evil.</p> <p>As for changing the world, they failed. All they achieved was to make West Germany a less tolerant, more paranoid society than it had been before. Laws passed in panic banned all 'radicals' (whatever that meant) from public service. Worst of all, the RAF terror campaign weakened the whole democratic left in Germany. The 'Wanted' posters, with faces crossed out in red as each was caught or killed, blazed on the walls of every police station, railway station, airport or frontier post. The 1968 visions of a new world of freedom, peace and fraternity were themselves driven underground.</p> <p>In notes made in Stammheim, Meinhof tried to explain the RAF's mission. 'Nauseated by the... system, the total commercialisation and absolute mendacity... deeply disappointed by the actions of the student movement... they thought it essential to spread the idea of armed struggle.' They were not so blind, she went on, as to think that they would bring about revolution in Germany, or that they would not be killed and imprisoned. The point was to 'salvage historically the whole state of understanding attained by the movement of 1967/68; it was a case of not letting the struggle fall apart again.'</p> <p>These are words with long echoes in the German past. Not really in the Nazi past, although many foreigners assume that the Baader-Meinhof gang were simply rebelling against the Nazi generation of their parents. Neither Stefan Aust's book nor Bernd Eichinger's film suggests that, and they are right not to. These echoes are from other places in German history: from the tradition of doomed struggle, fighting to the end in order to leave a message for the future.</p> <p>This is about the poet Georg B\u00fcchner's failed revolution in the 1830s ('Peace to the cottages! War on the palaces!'). It is about Eugen Levin\u00e9, who led a Munich revolution in 1919 which he knew was hopeless and was shot for it ('We are all dead men on leave'). It is about the plotters against Hitler, who hoped not to survive but to atone ('For the sake of 10 righteous men, may the city be spared').</p> <p>Those were all better causes than the RAF's. But the idea - the revolution as a message in a bottle, cast into the ocean from a drowning ship - still floats down into the present.</p> <p>The book and the film have the same title. But they are very different artefacts. The book was originally published in 1985 by Stefan Aust, a Spiegel journalist who had known some of the gang before they went underground. He himself arranged the benevolent kidnap of Ulrike Meinhof's small daughters, when he discovered that the RAF had decided to dump them in a Palestinian orphanage.</p> <p>Aust wrote a minutely detailed and closely researched account, which has now been brought up to date to take in new information from the Stasi files and elsewhere. It's especially good on the years at Stammheim, where the authorities committed every possible error, above all by keeping the prisoners in collective isolation as a group.</p> <p>The film, directed by Uli Edel, is also minutely detailed. It's brilliant, it's fearsomely convincing. But then, because this is a film about the perpetrators and not the victims, the sheer power of the telling has upset some citizens. They ask: 'Whose side are you on?' The film-makers would retort that they are on no side, just telling it as it was.</p> <p>Another criticism is that the RAF actors are so good-looking. Were they really so gorgeous? A few certainly were. Meinhof was more attractive than she seems here, while Ensslin - gauntly elegant - was less disco-sexy than Johanna Wokalek makes her. But the point about looks is political. One critic in Welt am Sonntag complained that the screen Baader and Ensslin were like Germany's answer to Bonnie and Clyde - a slander on both movies. But he went on to say that The Baader-Meinhof Complex 'brings to light a repressed truth about the allure of the RAF. Girls with guns are the ultimate desire and fear fantasy of a patriarchal, inhibited society.'</p> <p>Meinhof would have agreed with that. So might Ensslin. A wonderful scene in the film shows her strutting naked in the Lebanese sun, jeering at shocked Palestinian recruits. 'What's the matter? Fucking and shooting; it's the same thing!'</p> <p>In Europe's endless quest for true liberation, the RAF perished on the dirtiest and darkest of short cuts. They deserved to. But it was the same search.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The Baader Meinhof Complex is released on 14 November</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> A revised edition of The Baader-Meinhof Complex by Stefan Aust is published in paperback by Random House on 6 Nov</p> <h2>Red Army Faction: The main players</h2> <p><strong>Andreas Baader</strong></p> <p>Elegantly dressed, charismatic and violent, Baader was one of the founder members of the Red Army Faction who developed a taste for radical politics after moving to west Berlin in 1963.

  "<p>Building types are not what they used to be. I've noticed a trend for building-society premises to become high-concept Cornish pasty shops and have lost count of banks translated into pubs. And galleries are shape-shifting too. </p> <p>Rarely are Eastbourne and Chelsea mentioned in the same architectural (or cultural, social, artistic, sexual, gastronomic) paragraph, but right now the seaside Sussex gerontopolis and the perfumed, Audi-rich hinterlands of Sloane Square are competing with two of the most interesting galleries of recent years. (They'll be joined next year by London's Whitechapel, remodelled to the tune of \u00a310 million.) </p> <p>In Eastbourne, the old carpark site next to the Congress Theatre will soon be a new home for the Towner Gallery. In Chelsea, the drill hall of Pevsner's 'sturdy Tuscan portico' that fronts the 1801 Royal Military Asylum for the Children of Soldiers' Widows (more recently known as the Duke of York's) will next month open as the new permanent home of the notorious, wandering Saatchi.</p> <p>We use the word 'gallery' to describe an art museum because of Italian precedents. In Rome the Galleria of the Vatican displayed earth-bound Papal wealth while in Florence the Corridoio Vasariano was (and is) a splendid overground gallery linking the Pitti with Uffizi, designed to display Medici art with the intention of boggling the minds of visiting ambassadors and supplicants. But makeovers rather than new-build defined the two most interesting London galleries of the late 20th century. The first was The Boilerhouse Project in the Victoria &amp; Albert. This opened in what had been a fetid basement in early 1982. It was made possible by three people. First, Terence Conran who was passionate to proselytise about modern design and willing to put his money where his proselytiser was. Second, Sir Roy Strong, who said to me (I was the third person involved): 'Oooh, just get on with it, darling'. </p> <p>Getting on with it involved stripping back the old boilerhouse yard to make it a coruscating white-tiled box so harshly zeitgeisty that it was used in the credits for The Money Programme on the telly and the part of it that was my office was trialled as background for commercials about headache cures. The Boilerhouse's exhibitions about design made it 'London's most successful gallery of the Eighties', according to Arena. Since Arena was the most successful magazine of the Eighties, this must be true.</p> <p>The second significant gallery of the period was the Saatchi on Boundary Road in London's well-upholstered St John's Wood. This was an old paint factory superbly tightened and brightened by the late Max Gordon, an architect with connections to and influence in the New York art world. (Significantly, it was the same Max Gordon who found the site for Conran's Design Museum, another white box that opened in 1989.) Gordon's Saatchi Gallery was like the most magnificent imaginable SoHo loft.</p> <p>It opened in 1985. Here Charles Saatchi exhibited artists difficult at the time to find in this country: Donald Judd, Brice Marden and Cy Twombly, for example. It was an astonishingly wonderful, dramatic and beautiful place whose influence was only limited because St John's Wood is a lush backwater. Cleverly, Saatchi extended his influence by outreach. After all, if an adman does not understand marketing, distribution and demographics who does? Saatchi properties displayed at the Royal Academy in 1992 created the Young British Artist phenomenon and all the rest was... market-making.</p> <p>The Saatchi Gallery's move to London's County Hall in 2003 was only a mixed success. Although it became central, it lost credibility and energy. Being next to a tacky aquarium and a low-concept permanent Salvador Dali exhibition somehow located Saatchi in circus culture. Moreover, the architecture of County Hall was inappropriate and stifling and, besides, Charles himself seemed to have lost interest. It was rumoured he now preferred go-karting. So the new Saatchi Gallery is a welcome sign of resurrection.</p> <p>Architects AHMM spent three years looking for an appropriate site and, coincidence or not, eventually found one very close to Saatchi's Eaton Square home. It is a fine historic building in a beautiful wooded and grassy setting. AHMM stripped back the innards to reveal the underlying geometry and created 15 spacious new galleries on three floors. They are boldly white, sparely finished and top-lit, designed to create a recessive background for London's reclusive modern Medici. If they are recessive it is not because of a limited budget: none has been declared, but we may be certain Charles Saatchi does not stint himself. Anyway, this sort of recession is surely the right thing because so many art gallery designs - the Guggenheims in New York and Bilbao and the National Gallery extensions in London and Washington - fail because the showy architecture overwhelms the subtleties of painting.</p> <p>The new Saatchi Gallery will be a huge success, but the new Towner Gallery in Eastbourne is perhaps even more interesting since it can enjoy the strange pleasures and atmospheres which attend provincial galleries: many of them still carry that faint aroma of beeswax only barely disguising the shocking radicalism and missionary bohemianism represented by cautious nudes and rumours of subterranean life classes. Londoners, fatigued by excess, may not be shocked by Wolfgang Tillmans (and there is a striking one in the Towner's permanent collection). You can bet someone in Eastbourne will be.</p> <p>The Towner Gallery has a fascinating history. From 1923 to 2005 it was in a fine 18th-century manor house in Eastbourne's Old Town. Its first curator, Arthur Reeve Fowkes, had connections to the St Ives School and, to complement a foundation of topographical pictures, slowly built up a fine collection of English art including Edward Burra, Edward Wadsworth and Christopher Wood. Best of all, the Towner has the world's outstanding collection of Eric Ravilious, a local teacher who for my money was Britain's outstanding 20th-century artist. Because of this, in 1962 The Observer described the Towner as 'the most go ahead municipal gallery' in the country.</p> <p>So when in 2005 it was decided to turn the gallery's home into flats, a mighty engine of grant applications and local authority fixing for a new venue was started up. Curator Matthew Rowe came to Eastbourne from Tate St Ives. A competition was announced through the Official Journal of the European Union. More than 80 entries were received. Rick Mather Architects were selected not least because they were prepared to take Eastbourne seriously.</p> <p>The site is next door to the Congress Theatre, a 1963 landmark of modernismo now Grade II-listed and much admired by amateurs of period concrete. To develop a brief, Rowe travelled with the architects to see some noteworthy new small gallery spaces in Europe: Peter Zumthor's Kunsthaus in Bregenz, 1992 and Herzog and de Meuron's Schaulager in Basel, 2003, among them. Back in Sussex, they built a small jewel. </p> <p>Light is the enemy of art, so the street facade is a mixture of cladding with white-painted concrete and only exiguous daylight-openings. Major structural elements are in exposed fair-faced (that is to say: glass-smooth) concrete: the structure of sometimes daringly spanned posts and lintels is visible throughout. Outside, the square-on facade becomes voluptuous volumes around the side.</p> <p>The Towner design is modest only in the intelligent sense: budget restraints mean that goods and people have to share one giant lift. Visitors are ingeniously led through the levels of the building because the handsome staircase (solid black steel plate where there might have been banisters) rises through one floor at a time and exits at different ends. Through the balcony of the cafe is a view of redbrick and tile-hung late 19th-century Eastbourne. </p> <p>Through the biggest windows in the building: a fine view of the startlingly green championship tennis courts. Rowe has \u00a31m from the Art International Fund to spend on new acquisitions, but Miss Joan Hunter Dunn and I would just as soon see this fine building devoted in its entirety to the delightful and whimsical Eric Ravilious. And topographical watercolours in polite gilt frames would look gorgeous against its severe white modern walls. Still, splendid to have the choice.</p> <p>In the cab back to the station I pondered the nature of galleries. Agreeable spaces, controlled lighting, hints of the incongruous or transgressive licensed by the sanctity of art. Why do I find the Towner perhaps a little more interesting than the Saatchi? Something to do, perhaps, with the dissonant glory of great art in bingo and variety show territory. That mysterious surreal mood caught in Auden's 'Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts' or Eliot's 'Prufrock' in whose room the women 'come and go, talking of Michelangelo'. Eastbourne seems somehow more adventurous: Edward Burra on the South Coast is more of a challenge than Dinos Chapman in Chelsea. 'Oh do not ask \"what is it\"/Let us go and make our visit.' I think we should.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The new Saatchi Gallery opens on 9 Oct (<a href=\"http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk\">saatchi-gallery.co.uk</a>); to see pictures go to <a href=\"http://www.ahmm.co.uk\">ahmm.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>Among the quotations inscribed on the walls of the Scottish Parliament is the following from Walter Scott's The Heart of Midlothian: 'When we had a king, and a chancellor, and parliament-men o' our ain, we could aye peeble them wi' stanes when they werena gude bairns - but naebody's nails can reach the length o' Lunnon.'</p> <p>I often reflected on that quote during the early years of devolution. As a 'parliament-man' returned to Edinburgh, I bore some of the bruises from the modern equivalent of 'peebling', when things were perceived to have gone wrong. But one of the remarkable successes of the SNP government has been to protect itself from the 'stanes', not least by deflecting them in 'Lunnon's' direction.</p> <p>However, following the tumultuous events involving HBOS, the Teflon is beginning to lose some of its non-stick quality. Admittedly, in his first appearance in the Parliament, following the drama of the Lloyds-TSB takeover, Alex Salmond put in a masterful performance. With all his familiar swagger and self-assurance, he lambasted the 'spivs and speculators' and clearly implied that the UK government had been found wanting through its failure to take effective measures to combat short-sellers. What an opportunity to indulge the blame culture, especially if the culprits are in London.</p> <p>Only later did it emerge that the short-selling rate in the day before the HBOS takeover was less than 3 per cent. It was a contributory factor, but not the cause of the bank's downfall. Some of the real causes of weakness lay uncomfortably closer to home.</p> <p>But just as this set of emperor's clothing started to look a bit threadbare, Mr Salmond donned further imperial garb and announced to a Sunday newspaper that as leader of an independent Scotland, he would have acted to save Scotland's oldest bank. Billions of pounds, possibly as much as \u00a3100bn, would have been advanced by a Scottish government to rescue the bank. By Wednesday, Salmond was telling the Parliament that there had been a 'misunderstanding of the reference to the liquidity fund', but it is remarkable how many commentators laboured under that misunderstanding without the First Minister's fleet-of-foot press team putting them right earlier.</p> <p>After a long, sustained honeymoon, the former bank economist has looked much less sure-footed in responding to this major crisis. As a consequence, he has pointed up some key questions which will require answering as he makes his case for independence.</p> <p>For example, what now is the SNP's position on monetary policy in an independent Scotland?</p> <p>The most recent understanding has been that for some time after independence, Scotland would retain sterling alongside the rest of the United Kingdom. But by advocating that billions of pounds would have been made available to HBOS by an independent Scottish government, does Mr Salmond now favour a Scottish central bank and independent currency, with all the additional costs that would entail for those trading with our biggest trading partner south of the border?</p> <p>Even allowing for the possibility of a 'misunderstanding', how sensible is the policy of linking Scotland's currency to sterling? Support may be found in a recent paper for Reform Scotland's Policy Forum. Lawrence White, visiting professor at Queen's University, Belfast, noted that Scotland's exports to the rest of the UK are four times as great as exports to the euro zone. Accordingly, he argues: 'Given its current trading [and labour mobility] patterns, Scotland is more naturally a member of the sterling network than of the euro network.'</p> <p>The downside would be that monetary policy would be in the hands of the monetary policy committee (MPC) of a foreign country, not exactly a manifestation of the newly independent Scotland's sovereignty. While acknowledging that there is no precedent for MPC membership, Professor White does advance a number of reasons why Scotland should have a seat at the MPC table. But surely it stretches political credibility that a government, responsible solely to the remaining UK, should give a seat to independent Scotland, but not to Yorkshire or Wales.</p> <p>Recent events also raise the question of the future of financial regulation in an independent Scotland. In May, during Global Financial Services Week, Finance Secretary John Swinney stated that he didn't wish to undermine the competitiveness of Scotland's financial services sector and admitted that a unified 'UK' regulatory system after independence was undoubtedly an option. That, of course, means decisions affecting a key Scottish industry would be taken by a Parliament in which there would no longer be Scottish representation. But the alternative - a costly additional layer of Scottish regulation - would strike horror in the minds of Scotland's financial services sector. Some may not wait around to experience the consequences.</p> <p>These issues are not the small change of the independence debate - they are fundamental. Yet you will look in vain to find them addressed at all, let alone seriously, in the national conversation. And that takes us to the nub of the debate over a referendum. The question proposed by Salmond's government is not about the terms of independence but solely about a mandate to negotiate. The SNP government is opposed to a subsequent referendum on the negotiated terms.</p> <p>So when referendum protagonists argue that Scotland has a right to decide on its future, what they really mean is that Scotland can decide whether to give Alex Salmond a blank cheque. It would be the biggest blank cheque in Scotland's history since the commissioners were dispatched to London to negotiate the terms of Union.</p> <p>Many of them were peebled on their return.</p>",
  "<p>The financial crisis in recent weeks spread instantly through global markets. Political ideas, it turns out, are less agile at crossing continents.</p> <p>In the US, consensus was soon reached that some form of massive state intervention was required. Disagreement between government and Congress has focused on how far taxpayers should be exposed and what regulations should be imposed on bankers to make a bailout acceptable to voters.</p> <p>In Britain there is no equivalent debate. There have been temporary measures to restore confidence in markets, but no moves to reshape them for the public good. Both the Chancellor and the Prime Minister suggested at the Labour party conference last week that the financiers had lost their way, and perhaps rewarded themselves unduly. But there were no policies to reflect that view.</p> <p>Meanwhile, leading Conservatives have slipped into default positions of laissez-faire orthodoxy. London mayor Boris Johnson published a jaunty paean to the City, shadow chancellor George Osborne opposed the ban on short-selling, David Cameron warned that 'the left' might use financial turbulence as 'an excuse to wreck an important part of the British and world economy'.</p> <p>That was an uncharacteristic lapse into dogmatism by the Conservative leader. Calls for tighter City regulation are not all motivated by reactionary statism. There is a broader revulsion at the culture of financial thrill-seeking that has imperilled the whole economy. Appetite for redress cuts across traditional left-right divides.</p> <p>Neither the Prime Minister nor his Tory rival has expressed what the US political establishment grasped immediately: that the bankers' party is over; that the job in hand is to avert a catastrophe of epoch-changing proportions; that inaction for fear of offending free-market doctrine would be unforgivable.</p> <p>Gordon Brown came close when he said last week that future generations will study the events of recent weeks. He spoke encouragingly of the need for a 'new settlement'. But he did not explain what it would look like, raising suspicions that his strategy is driven as much by fear for his own position as by grand economic designs. He wants people to be in sufficient awe at the gravity of the current situation that they will rally to a leader reputed for gravitas, and reject 'novices'.</p> <p>Mr Brown succeeded at least in putting the opposition on the defensive for the first time in nearly a year. Labour's poll agonies and internal feuds have allowed the Tories to develop their ideas at leisure. It can no longer be said that they do not have policies. They would, for example, use the tax system to support marriage, divert funding on education to anyone willing to set up a new school, introduce elected police commissioners, abolish stamp duty for some first-time buyers, cap immigration from outside the EU.</p> <p>Some of Mr Cameron's plans are not sensitive to economic downturn, but others would be sabotaged by a recession - paying the private and voluntary sectors to find jobs for the unemployed, for example. That only works when there are vacancies to be filled. If the credit crunch leads to large numbers of people losing their homes and their jobs, neither private finance nor charity will provide an adequate safety net. That responsibility will lie with government.</p> <p>More generally, Mr Cameron has summarised his economic credo with the pledge to 'share the proceeds of growth' with the people. (As opposed to spending them on an expanding state.) That was a vague aspiration at the best of times; it is meaningless if the economy is shrinking.</p> <p>The Conservative leader will be judged this week on how nimbly he can adjust his rhetoric to the dramatic changes in the economic climate. That means recognising that the era of unfettered market power might be drawing to a close. The gut resistance in much of his party to any form of regulation or government intervention is a poor guide to how to respond to the current crisis.</p> <p>Radical Thatcherism is not the only Tory tradition, and blind faith in market forces should not be the party's defining feature, as Mr Cameron, to his credit, has acknowledged in the past.</p> <p>He describes his own conservatism as 'compassionate', 'liberal' and 'progressive'. But that has so far been expressed mainly as vague environmentalism and the hope of persuading charities and businesses to shoulder welfare obligations instead of the state. That is not enough.</p> <p>A truly compassionate and progressive view of the challenge now facing Britain would start by acknowledging that financial markets failed. They failed not just because of inadequate regulation, but because individual players in the City lost sight of their obligations to the wider economy and to society. They failed on their own professional terms to evaluate risk, and they failed morally, by demanding freedom from restraint and then abusing it. That should not be a matter of dispute between left and right. It is a matter of fact. Last week Gordon Brown wasted his chance to say it. David Cameron still can.</p>",
  "<p>West Ham's legal team have plenty on their plate at the moment, but they could be forgiven for fearing the club will face a smash-and-grab charge after goals from Carlton Cole and Matthew Etherington enabled the Hammers to nick three points at Craven Cottage.</p> <p>'It was a weird game,' said Fulham boss Roy Hodgson. 'We did some excellent things and I'm happy with the performance yet left unhappy with the result.' Fulham had looked by far the superior side for the first 40 minutes as their crisp passing contrasted starkly with the disjointedness of the visitors. Suddenly, however, basic blunders created openings for West Ham, who at least had the wherewithal to exploit them.</p> <p>First, Paul Konchesky, still reeling from the injustice of his booking for a foul on Etherington moments before, abandoned his post at right-back, allowing Etherington to dash down the wing and deliver a cross that dropped at Cole's feet, via Mark Schwarzer's hand, which he slammed into the net.</p> <p>Two minutes later, a loft over the top from Mark Noble, allowed Etherington through where he beat Schwarzer to the ball and prodded it into an empty net.</p> <p>Things deteriorated even further for Fulham when Andrew Johnson was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for a late tackle on Lucas Neill. Hodgson protested afterwards that the decision was harsh, but acknowledged that his striker could have been dismissed earlier after his late lunge on Herita Ilunga.</p> <p>With Noble growing sufficiently in prominence to become the best of the 11 English players on display for Fabio Capello, West Ham began the second half positively and only fine saves from Schwarzer kept them at bay. That ambition soon dwindled, however, and Fulham regained the upperhand, narrowing the score when Danny Murphy converted a penalty awarded for a handball by Neill.</p> <p>Despite their greater fluidity the home side did not threaten to equalise and through counter-attacks West Ham almost embellished their lead, Cole coming close before substitute Craig Bellamy ballooned the ball over an empty goal.</p> <p>As during last week's defeat at Blackburn, Hodgson declined to make any alterations to his team despite the scoreline. 'I couldn't see anything I could do that would make a difference,' he admitted. 'We needed to keep the full-backs on because West Ham were dangerous on the break and up front Bobby [Zamora] was doing well.'</p> <p>His counterpart, Gianfranco Zola, merely smiled: 'You need a little luck to win.'<br><strong><br>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Richard Allen, <a href=\"http://CravenCottageNewsround.wordpress.com\">CravenCottageNewsround.wordpress.com</a></strong></p> <p>It was a beautiful day at Craven Cottage, except for the result. We started off well and had few chances, but then in five minutes we lost the game after West Ham scored twice and Johnson got sent off. He was a bit unlucky as he was just eager and timed his challenge a little too early. We need more of a killer instinct, as Green barely had a save to make all game, and for everyone's good effort - especially Bullard, who was fantastic - we rarely looked like scoring. Again Hodgson made no substitutes, does he have a problem trusting anyone outside the first XI? Playing with 10 men tired us and we needed fresh legs.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Schwarzer 5; Panstil 5, Hughes 6, Hangeland 5, Konchesky 5; Davies 7, Bullard 9, Murphy 7, Gera 6; Johnson 4, Zamora 5</p> <p><strong>Pete May, Author, Hammers in the Heart</strong></p> <p>With Fulham enjoying the better start, I'd have been happy with 0-0 at half-time, but out of nowhere we scored two. After the Sheffield United debacle this week it was great to get a result. Zola seems to have got the team passing the ball around more and Etherington is really flourishing in his new role behind the strikers. Our fans gave Zamora and Panstil a good reception, although after Panstil fouled Green he got a few boos. Annoyingly, we should never have gifted Fulham a penalty and still lack the killer touch, as we missed three or four good chances to score a third. All in all, though, I am pleased we have 12 points so far and if we get in the Champions League this season it will help pay off our \u00a330m fine.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Green 6; Faubert 6, Upson 6, Neill 6, Ilunga 7; Parker 7 (Boa Morte n/a), Noble 7, Behrami 6, Etherington 8 (Mullins n/a); Di Michele 5 (Bellamy 5), Cole 7</p> <p><em><strong>To take part in the verdict, email<br>fans@observer.co.uk</strong></em></p>",
  "<p>Along with an ancient tin of palm hearts, a porcelain Chinese preserved-ginger jar; a small bottle of Timothy White's, chemist, olive oil; and some saffron 'powder' brought back from Spanish holidays, there also appeared in our kitchen cupboards one day, when I was about nine, a small jar of something called Melba sauce.</p> <p>I was always rootling around in our food cupboards. Standing on a chair to reach to the back of the highest shelf, I had a desperate urge to see what next I could find to stick my finger in/sniff/drink. In particular, I had a fondness for Sarson's malt vinegar, mainly because I really liked the taste - still do - but also for the shock of its sweetish, acidic hit. But this Melba sauce was something else. I think it was the Epicure brand, and quite clearly had been bought at great expense, by Mum, from somewhere like the food hall of Kendal Milne, then Manchester's premier department store. </p> <p>Obviously I would not be able to open this intriguing new treasure until the seal had been broken. So began one of those interminable waits, interspersed with pathetic requests of, 'Mum... when are you going to open the Melba sauce? Mum? When?' until she was close to tearing her hair out. But one Saturday night Mum opened a can of Del Monte cling peaches, tipped them into a cut-glass bowl and very sweetly handed me the jar of Melba sauce to unscrew. She also took from the freezing compartment of the fridge (no such thing as a separate freezer in those days, at least not in our house) a block of Lyons Maid Cornish vanilla. </p> <p>Thick slices of ice cream were placed into matching glass bowls and a half peach perched on top. Until now I hadn't even smelled the Melba sauce, let alone poked a finger inside, but Mum proceeded to pour it over each peach until some dribbled on to the ice cream as well. 'Quick, let's take them to the table before the ice cream melts!' she urged. Well, I almost ran. </p> <p>It goes without saying that I had read and re-read the ingredients, so knew Melba sauce was made from raspberries and sugar. It tasted something like raspberry jam without the bits. I adored its smoothness, its dark ruby colour and its runny, jelly-like consistency as it coated the peach halves. The assembly was tooth-shockingly sweet. 'That, boys, is what is known as Peach Melba,' Mum said. 'Fab!' I cried, copying my elder brother's jargon of the time. </p> <p>Misery, however, came a week later, when it was discovered that the remains of the sauce had been surreptitiously taken in occasional addictive spoonfuls by someone standing on a chair, until no more than a smear was left. I was sent to bed in disgrace. Worse, Melba sauce was never again seen in our cupboard.</p> <p>More than 40 years on, I have often played around with making a nice Melba sauce. Or, at least, one that pleases me. Recently I have been veering more to the taste of that dangerous jar in the cupboard: I want it a touch 'jammy', rather than simply a fresh pink pur\u00e9e of raspberries and sugar that I used to prefer. Apart from anything else, I love the fragrant smell of raspberries cooking. </p> <h2>Sand cake with melba sauce and mascarpone cream</h2> <p>I first ate this remarkable cake in Italy, in 1984, while on holiday with my Australian friend Gay Bilson. It was at the Albergo del Sole, in Maleo, a small town an hour or so south of Milan (I fear the restaurant no longer exists). The late Signor Colombani was the proprietor and cook and a passionate gatherer of traditional, often ancient Italian recipes, of which Sabbiosa con crema di mascarpone must surely be one. It is instantly clear as to why sand cake is thus called: the crumb is so exceptionally fine that the weight of a fork almost falls straight through. The first recipe I tried was a disaster. </p> <p>Although it was in a beautifully photographed book, I have never been quite so sure of the recipes. Then, a few years ago, another recipe was published in a weekend newspaper, so I cut it out and kept it (sadly, my yellowing cutting does not have the writer's name attached). Recently I gave it a go. And what a success! It may take a little while to exactly mimic the original from 24 years ago, but early efforts have greatly pleased. It is particularly good eaten just warm, with Melba sauce and - how Signor Colombani served it - with his gorgeous mascarpone cream.</p> <p>Note: although the original measurements are unaltered, I have slightly adjusted some of the method: I have made three cakes over the past 10 days, using trial and error; in fact, the next time I am going to cook the cake at 150C/gas mark 3 all the time, but cooked for slightly longer. Anyway, please persevere, as a successful end result is very exciting. Serves 6.</p> <p><strong>for the Melba sauce:</strong><br><strong>250g raspberries</strong><br><strong>40g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>juice of \u00bd lemon</strong></p> <p><strong>for the mascarpone cream:</strong><br><strong>150g mascarpone</strong><br><strong>30g icing sugar </strong><br><strong>30ml single cream</strong><br><strong>30ml rum - or, perhaps, raspberry eau de vie </strong></p> <p><strong>for the cake:</strong><br><strong>200g icing sugar, plus extra for dusting </strong><br><strong>200g lightly salted butter, cut into chunks and softened, plus extra for the cake tin</strong><br><strong>2 eggs</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp Cognac</strong><br><strong>200g potato flour </strong><br><strong>1 tsp baking powder</strong><br><strong>fine, dry breadcrumbs</strong></p> <p>To make the Melba sauce, put everything in a stainless-steel pan and slowly warm through. Once the raspberry juices run, simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until quite thick and syrupy. Push through a fine sieve into a bowl and chill.</p> <p>Whisk together the ingredients for the mascarpone cream and also chill. Note: if the cream is too thick, thin with a little milk.</p> <p>To make the cake, place the icing sugar and butter in an electric mixer (or electric hand whisk) and whisk at high speed for about 10 minutes, until very white and fluffy. Gently but thoroughly stir in the eggs and Cognac using a manual whisk. Now carefully add the potato flour, by sifting and folding it in, in 3 or 4 batches. Also add the baking powder at the same time. </p> <p>Generously butter and breadcrumb-dust a loose-bottomed cake tin (spring-form is best), about 18-20cm wide and 5cm deep. Pour in the mixture and cook in the oven at 150C/gas mark 3 for 15 minutes, then at 180C/gas mark 4 for 20 minutes, then switch off the heat and leave in the oven for a further 20 minutes. </p> <p>Remove from the oven and let the cake cool in the tin for 30 minutes. Remove, dust with icing sugar and slice when lukewarm, with the mascarpone cream and Melba sauce spooned over how you will.</p> <h2>Raspberry crumble</h2> <p>I like to serve these in individual shallow dishes for best effect. Serves 2.</p> <p><strong>75g plain flour</strong><br><strong>40g lightly salted butter, plus a little extra</strong><br><strong>30g sugar, plus a little extra</strong><br><strong>250g raspberries</strong></p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4.</p> <p>To make the crumble, place all the ingredients except the raspberries into a big, roomy bowl and deftly rub them together until they're rubbled with tiny bits of butter amid an otherwise sandy texture. </p> <p>Divide the raspberries between two dishes, sprinkle with a little sugar and dot with a few flecks of butter. Using a spoon, carefully cover with the crumble mixture, but do not be tempted to press it down. Dust with a little extra sugar. </p> <p>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until pale golden and the raspberry juice is gently bubbling. Eat warm, with thick, very cold cream.</p> <h2>Raspberry granita</h2> <p>To finish, as simple a recipe as one could imagine. Fragrant, sharp and to the point. The colour shocks, the taste puckers the mouth, and its texture continues - almost - to that very last slushy slurp. Serves 4 generously. </p> <p><strong>400g raspberries</strong><br><strong>250ml water</strong><br><strong>100g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>juice of 1 small lemon</strong></p> <p>Put everything into a stainless-steel pan and bring to a simmer. Cook for a few minutes and then strain through a sieve suspended over a deep bowl. Allow to drip for anything up to an hour. What is needed, particularly, is a sparklingly sweet raspberry juice; do not try and force more through the sieve as this will cloud the juice. Leave to cool, pour into a shallow container, and place in the freezer.</p> <p>Every so often, maybe by the hour, take a fork and bring the semi-frozen pink edges into the middle of the molten ruby pool. Keep doing this until all is pink crystals and the molten ruby pool has disappeared. </p> <p>Serve in chilled glasses and eat with a teaspoon.</p> <p>\u2022 Nigel Slater returns in a fortnight</p>",
  "<p>'A veces la vida es perfecta,' says the advert for Alhambra Reserve beer in the middle of the luggage carousel at Granada airport - 'Sometimes life is perfect.' As we stand wearily in the baggage-reclaim hall, life seems anything but, and yet I'm excited. We're about to have what looks, on paper at least, like the weekend with everything. </p> <p>Of course, Granada is an amazing historic city, with everything that encompasses: restaurants, bars, nightlife, cathedrals and culture, and a huge choice of fabulous hotels. Less well known is that it has its own ski resort, just 30 minutes' drive up the hill. And we're not just talking about a couple of lowly blue runs - there are 88km of slopes and the top lift rises to an impressive 3,300m. </p> <p>Better still, you don't need to take a single day off work. If you live within striking distance of Stansted, you can take Ryanair's Friday-night flight direct to Granada, then fly home, after two full days' skiing, on Sunday night. If you come during the ski season you get to see the city when it's far quieter than in the peak summer months, and room rates, even at the grandest historic hotels, come crashing down. Oh, and if you fancy easing off the muscles after your day on the piste, you can head to the seaside - the beach is only 45 minutes down the road. </p> <p>Thankfully, we don't have to stare at the Alhambra beer advert too long. Ours is the only plane on the tarmac, the terminal is deserted, and our skis and bags come out almost immediately. Picking up our car takes five minutes and, after 20 minutes' drive, we're pulling up to our hotel in the city centre. Just over an hour after landing, we're in our first tapas bar, glasses in hand, and, if not perfect, life is looking very rosy indeed. </p> <p>Next day I feel terrible, as we swing up the mountain roads to the resort. There are regular buses, but it's far better to hire a car and drive yourself, thus also avoiding the need for airport taxis. The journey is only 31km and shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes, but only if you leave early - no later than 8.30am - to beat the crowds, which can cause traffic jams. Despite the lingering taste of rioja, vermouth and jamon serrano in my mouth, it's a fabulous morning - the sun is just rising behind the peaks, throwing down dramatic shafts of light on to the contour-hugging road. </p> <p>In lay-bys, old men are opening stalls selling honey and nuts. We drive past olive and cherry trees and rows of almond trees covered in delicate pink blossom. It's so warm and springlike that it seems astonishing we're actually going skiing, but, as we pass 2,000m, we hit the snowline, and at 2,100m come to the Sierra Nevada ski resort. </p> <p>It has to be said that while Granada is one of Europe's most gorgeous cities, its ski resort is one of the ugliest. There was never an original village here to give focus and charm, and, instead of creating a purpose-built resort with coherent styles and themes, the Spanish have thrown up all manner of modern blocks, jumbled together at random. It's a relief to head up the lifts away from the resort, with Carlos, our instructor, who tells us we're lucky. The previous day wind closed the lifts all day. 'I just got in my car and drove down to the beach instead,' he says with a grin. </p> <p>Carlos also explains that snow conditions are unrelated to those in the Alps. Last winter the Alps did well, the Sierra Nevada less so, but it can be vice-versa, making this a clever alternative. Because of the altitude - most skiing is above 2,600m - the season is long, running from the start of December to the end of April, and the lifts run long hours too, from 9am until a staggered closing between 4.45pm and 5.30pm. </p> <p>There's lots of good skiing here, if few off-piste challenges for real experts. At Borreguiles, there's a super-wide area for beginners, with the terraces of a number of caf\u00e9s directly beneath it in case there's need for a comforting drink. On a ridge above is a huge radio telescope (sited here on account of the clear skies) beyond which are the best runs of all, hidden away in the secluded Laguna bowl. </p> <p>The mountains feel very different to the Alps. Rather than craning our necks up to look at the jagged peaks, we're soon standing on top of the highest mountains for hundreds of miles (hence the occasional wind problem), looking down to the grey hills far below. From the top lift, which stops just short of the peak of Veleta, we can see the olive groves of Cazorla in the north, Granada to the west, and, to the south, the plastic tunnels of Almer\u00eda's fruit farms and the distant sparkle of the Mediterranean. The piste map even marks the Rif mountains of Morocco in the distance; it must be the only resort in the world that can show the mountains of two continents on its map.</p> <p>The other key selling point of this ski area, the southernmost in Europe by a very long way, is the sun. By the time we finish skiing, it's baking hot and crowds of people are soaking up the rays in the strip of bars at the bottom of the pistes. These bars - Cuna, Tia Maria and Parallel - are pretty much identical and don't serve tapas with the drinks, but their terraces face the afternoon sun and straight towards the mountains, so your view isn't blotted by the resort itself. </p> <p>On Saturdays you can relax in a deck chair for a few hours in the afternoon, then head back up for more skiing. From 7pm to 9pm the gondola reopens and the long, sweeping El Rio piste is floodlit for night skiing. But, for us, the pull of Granada is too great.</p> <p>Back in town, we are spoilt for choice for spots to sit and watch the sunset over the mountains we'd been skiing on hours earlier. One excellent vantage point is the grand terrace bar of the four-star Alhambra Palace Hotel. This evening, we give it a miss and park up and wander into the Sacromonte district, famous for its gypsy population and troglodyte houses. The more we walk, away from the centre of town, pressing further up the increasingly steep-sided, narrow gorge alongside the river Darro, the more bucolic the atmosphere.</p> <p>We're aimlessly wandering up the Verea de Enmedio, a winding cobbled lane no more than two feet wide, when we turn a corner to find a widening in the path, leaving enough space for a couple of orange trees to grow. Outside a cave doorway, a little metal table has been set up, from which sangria is being served. A few people sit drinking on a higgledy-piggledy collection of mismatched chairs. Two old gypsy women peel oranges, their skin dark and lined, their eyes dramatically made up. Two kittens play at their feet. Other people straddle the wall, looking past the Alhambra to where the entire city stretches out before them, and, beyond, to the setting sun.</p> <p>There's no sign, but the barman later tells me it's called Bar Chiringuito. I think I've discovered the world's most romantic apr\u00e8s-ski bar. Sometimes, life is perfect after all. </p> <p>\u2022 Extracted from White Weekends, Tom Robbins's book on Europe's best skiing and snowboarding short breaks, published by Bantam Press (\u00a320).

  "<h2>The group</h2> <p><strong>'Find us somewhere fun and lively'</strong><br>Ola Jeruzel, projects co-ordinator, 29, Daniel Cremin, 29, communication executive, and Alex Bakir, 25, market development executive, London</p> <p><strong>The brief: </strong>'We're looking for a ski holiday somewhere fun and lively - there'll be about eight of us - and we like the idea of Italy, probably some time after the New Year. We'll be a mix of beginners and intermediates and want something that's good value, but are not after the very cheapest option.' <br><strong>Budget: </strong>\u00a3600-plus each</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong><br><strong>Ultimate Ski's Eric Kendall:</strong> 'Sauze d'Oulx in Italy was an alpine party mecca through the Eighties that was dragged up to date (a bit) for the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics. With good snow there's wonderful skiing that should suit their group. It's part of the enormous Milky Way ski domain which extends into France if they want a really long day out. The downside is that the area doesn't have the best snow record. </p> <p>'At the other end of the country, much of Italy's S\u00fcdtirol would qualify as lively fun, Austrian-style. There's more German than Italian spoken in most places and standards of accommodation are high. Kronplatz is well worth investigating as the skiing's excellent and the nearby town of Bruneck would provide good evenings out. Neilson (<a href=\"http://www.neilson.co.uk\">neilson.co.uk</a>) has January prices from \u00a3345pp for a week at Pension Prack in Kronplatz, flying from Gatwick.' </p> <p><strong>Ski Club of Great Britain's Betony Garner: </strong>'Italy's a good choice for this budget. Most Italian resorts are less busy than others in the Alps and the food tends to be good and not extortionate. They could try Selva Gardena in the Italian Dolomites or Cervinia in the northwest. All are good for beginners and intermediates. To get the best value they should look at self catering apartments or a catered chalet which is not too fancy. Selva Gardena has amazing scenery and a big ski area which connects to other resorts. Cervinia, which shares its ski area with Zermatt, has many wide slopes perfect for beginners and has a good snow record. The group should definitely be able to find a holiday within budget due to the large number of UK tour operators travelling to these resorts - try Crystal (0871 231 5659; <a href=\"http://www.crystalski.co.uk\">crystalski.co.uk</a>) or Inghams (020 8780 4433; <a href=\"http://www.inghams.co.uk\">inghams.co.uk</a>).'</p> <h2>The solo-learner</h2> <p><strong>'I really want to have a go'</strong><br>Simon Myall, 32, consultant, London</p> <p><strong>The brief: </strong>'I've never skied before and would really like to have a go, but none of my friends are into the idea so I'm thinking of going on my own this winter. Could I join a group trip, or be in a shared chalet so I could meet other skiers? I'd like somewhere that's quite lively with good apr\u00e8s-ski for the evenings, but nothing too built up, and with good ski schools too. I'm open to suggestions regarding the destination.'<br><strong>Budget: </strong>Around \u00a31,000 (could be stretched for something really special)</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong><br><strong>Ultimate Ski's Eric Kendall: </strong>'Going solo is not a problem as group lessons are an easy way to meet people. Simon could consider a specialist teaching outfit such as Inspired to Ski (0845 890 0390; <a href=\"http://www.inspiredtoski.com\">inspiredtoski.com</a>) rather than choosing a resort and relying on local ski schools. There are good ones, but it's a lottery - not just because of the language, but many beginners' classes are set up primarily for children. Another specialist, New Generation (0844 484 3663; <a href=\"http://www.skinewgen.com\">skinewgen.com</a>), has a centre in Courchevel 1850 in France. Simon could stay at Ski Total's Chalet Hotel Coq de Bruy\u00e8re from \u00a3529 per adult for seven nights, flights included. Chalet hotels are a good compromise - more matey than a hotel but without the enforced intimacy of a small chalet, and there is certainly nightlife in Courchevel. Otherwise, there are classic beginner destinations, such as Andorra's Soldeu or Alpbach in Austria. Before he goes, Simon should visit a dry slope or an indoor snowslope such as Xscape at Milton Keynes (<a href=\"http://www.xscape.co.uk\">xscape.co.uk</a>) to get started - and try to get fit in advance.' </p> <p><strong>Alpine Answers' Earl Knudsen: </strong>'The fact that Simon's friends don't want to try skiing should not stop him having a great time learning and meeting others in the same position. We would recommend that Simon stays in a chalet hotel. In the evening he will no doubt meet his fellow learners in the bar to discuss the trials and tribulations of the day. The package we recommend is run by Mark Warner, staying in their chalet hotel Cristallo in Courmayeur, Italy, from \u00a3580 a week in a single room, with flights, breakfast, tea, dinner with wine, and ski hosting. The resort is perfect for first-time skiers; the nursery slopes are gentle and the progression is smooth. The scenery is great and there are plenty of good restaurants on the mountain. The apr\u00e8s-ski is vibrant and there is plenty of nightlife later in the evening.' </p> <p><strong>Welove2ski's Felice Hardy: </strong>'Austria would be the ideal place to learn and has some of the best apr\u00e8s-ski too. I love Kitzb\u00fchel: it's ideal for beginners who quickly learn to tackle the huge number of gentle blue runs in the area. The gorgeous medieval town centre is pedestrianised and offers great nightlife in the evenings. Hotel Tyrol is a club-hotel that works on the same concept as a chalet. Other guests would all be British and Simon would sit at a table with others at dinner. It's 100m from the main square, 800m from the lifts and 30m from the ski bus stop. A week costs from \u00a3445pp for seven nights' half-board and there are no single supplements. A skiers' pack costs from \u00a3269pp and includes a lift pass, ski equipment rental and six days' tuition.

Over the past few years we've been to Arabba in the Italian Dolomites but would like to try somewhere new. We like places where you don't have to spend lots of time queueing. We want a bit of nightlife, but it doesn't have to be the focus, and prefer chalet accommodation. We've never been to Canada or America.'<br><strong>Budget: </strong>\u00a31,000 each</p> <p><strong>The solution </strong><br><strong>Ultimate Ski's Eric Kendall: </strong>'Exploring the world on skis is fun and North America is good for a complete change. Skiing isn't generally chalet-based, neither does it have European-style night-life, though the size of accommodation and amenities tend to impress UK visitors and crowds are usually unheard of. They could try Canada for European-scale mountains and exceptional snow. If they are happy to rent a car they could visit some Powder Highway resorts trying a couple of days in Panorama, Fernie, Kicking Horse or even Lake Louise.

The snow records of both resorts are good, so Sophie should find some runs to challenge her. If they would prefer Europe, then Serre Chevalier in France, formed of four pretty villages, is not as busy as many other resorts, so queuing is rarely a problem, and there is skiing for all levels.

I love the big name resorts such as Val d'Is\u00e8re and Tignes, but these days nothing on-piste holds any real attraction. What I really want is to get off-piste and off the beaten track - somewhere with a bit of character, some steep skiing and some apr\u00e8s-ski. I'd particularly like somewhere where I can take a course to improve my off-piste skiing.

These courses are quite intensive but a lot of fun, as you are in a group with five others. Mountain Tracks have courses for all levels, from those who have never done any off-piste skiing to advanced skiers with extensive off-piste skills. Most of the courses are held in smaller resorts such as Gressoney in Italy's Monterosa area, St Foy in the Tarentaise in France, Zinal in Val d'Anniviers in Switzerland and St Gervais in the Mont Blanc area of France.

  "<p>Peter John has known for years that the change was coming. The elders had foretold it. As a young Eskimo boy he would sit at the feet of his father and grandfather, uncles and great uncles as they arranged themselves in a circle in the qasgiq, the house built of sods dug deep into the tundra and reserved only for the men. Outside, snow would lay thick on the ground and the sea would be a single block of ice. Inside, the heat of the men's bodies would keep young Peter warm. An elder would be chosen to lead the discussion and would sometimes speak uninterrupted for an entire day.</p> <p>It was during these conversations in the dark Alaskan winters that Peter learned about the change coming. A great reversal would happen. The seasons would be turned upside down. The Eskimos from his village and all along the coast of the Bering Sea would never see the winter again. The snow would disappear.</p> <p>The elders were observant, and they formed their predictions by watching the land and sea, not for hours, not for days, but for months and years. And they passed their knowledge down by word of mouth in the village qasgiq.</p> <p>Peter is 72 now, an elder himself. Though he has lost the sight in one eye, he is no less observant than his father and grandfather before him. He has watched the change they foretold come true. In the old days the snow would be piled so high it would reach the top of the schoolhouse in Newtok, his village on the Alaskan coast. Children would use it as a snow ladder to climb on to the roof. Not any more. Most years the snow would lie thick on the ground well into June. Now it can be gone by April, bringing in flocks of geese from the south months before they are due.</p> <p>In the old days he would take the dog teams out in January or February across the pack ice to catch sticklebacks, digging holes through a layer of ice 6ft thick or more. Now it is less than 4ft thick. Then the cold was biting, but there was little wind and the sour dog plant would be covered in frosty icicles. Now the wind blows so fierce the plant is bare. And, most noticeable of all, the land itself is being swallowed up. Years ago, all he could see from his window was land stretching far into the distance. Now the water is at the village edge, moving closer and closer to Peter's house, eating away at the earth. Soon it will be Newtok's turn to disappear.</p> <p>When Peter was a child the elders told him the change was coming. Now Peter is an elder, he tells the children the change is here.</p> <p>The journey to America's first community of global-warming refugees involves a series of stages, each one more bone-rattling than the last. First comes a flight into Anchorage, Alaska's largest town, passing over the humbling magnificence of the Chugach Mountains, whose 10,000ft pinnacles have been smoothed over by glaciers like whitewash over the stones of an old farmhouse. A second flight takes us to Bethel, a regional hub of 5,000 people. It's clear we are getting somewhere now: instead of the usual glossy magazines, the counter at Bethel airport offers waiting travellers a well-thumbed book called The AR-15: Complete Assembly Guide to the Assault Rifle, Volume 2</p> <p>The last stage is a harrowing ride in a Cessna single-propeller plane, the sort that slithers through the air like a puck in a game of ice hockey. It's no comfort that before boarding you are required to tell the pilot how much you weigh. The flight covers hundreds of miles of tundra formed by the Yukon and Kuskokwim estuaries that run into the Bering Sea. In summer, thousands of thaw lakes interconnect with sloughs and streams, producing the pattern of syrup drizzled over a pancake.</p> <p>With a sudden jolt, we land along a gravel strip that sits barely above the water line. There to welcome us is a group of scraggily dressed children playing beside a notice that reads: 'No kids, no bikers, no swimming, no ATV riding allowed at the airport'. </p> <p>We have arrived in Newtok, a village of about 320 people on the southwest coast of Alaska - a location about as remote as can be found. The nearest connecting road is 400 miles away. Without the arrival of the daily plane, the villagers would be almost entirely cut off from so-called civilisation, though that would hardly bother them, as they lead a largely subsistence existence, as had their forebears for 2,000 years.</p> <p>They are Yup'ik Eskimos (not to be confused with the more northern Inuit, who are not Eskimos) and they form the largest group of native Alaskans. Yup'ik means real - and you see why when confronted by the harshness and rawness of their lives. A walk through the village reveals an extraordinary confluence of ancient ways and modernity. Peter John, for instance, lives in a wooden house raised on stilts. Now that he no longer goes out to fish and hunt, he spends his days in an armchair in his neat sitting room. From his window he can see wooden sheds where supplies of herring and salmon are drying for the winter, just as they would have been 1,000 years ago. Scattered about the village are the hides of musk ox and the skulls of walrus and moose, some with antlers 8ft across. Yet parked alongside them are hulking snowmobiles and the ubiquitous ATV quadbikes that roar between the houses.</p> <p>To add to the incongruity, Newtok's 60 houses and communal buildings are sinking and tilting at odd angles. Many are tipping downwards on their southern flank, as though they are kneeling and paying obeisance to the muddy earth. A rickety gap-toothed boardwalk connects the homes, and it too is sinking and bending in great undulations.</p> <p>Peter John's house is about 15 buildings in from the edge of the village. Walk on a further 150ft or so and you come to the Ninglick River, a wide waterway that flows out to the Bering Sea. It is here, at the edge of the water, that the vague sense of things being out of kilter forms itself into a vision of imminent disaster. In front of us a slab of land, not much smaller than Peter John's house, has collapsed and keeled over into the sea, leaving a crevice several feet wide and about 10ft deep between it and the mainland.</p> <p>I jump down into the hole and start scratching around in the mud for an explanation. About 6ft below the surface level of the tumbled earth is a layer of ice, hard to the touch, glistening faintly in the daylight. It looks unassuming, but it tells a story of monumental significance. It is permafrost, and it has been there beneath thousands of miles of Alaska, Canada, Russia and beyond for thousands of years, acting as a solid wall that holds the sea at bay and maintaining the integrity of the land. It also acts as foundations for the roads and buildings that sit upon it, Peter John's house included.</p> <p>But that glistening is ominous. The permafrost is melting. The layer of ice in the crevice in which I stand is weeping, shedding large teardrops that are quickly soaked up by the soggy earth lower down. I can see too what is left behind when the ice melts - nothing but friable soil, as soft and spongy as rum baba.</p> <p>It is this layer of melting ice that has turned Newtok into what one observer described as the Ground Zero of global warming. According to Nasa, temperatures in Alaska have risen more than any other place on the planet in the past 50 years - by some 4F on average, and up to 10F in winter. The Arctic in general has experienced a rate of warming that is double the earth's average, in part as a result of what is known as positive feedback. The brilliant white surface of ice and snow normally reflects most radiation from the sun back into space. But once the ice starts to melt through warming temperatures, the exposed land absorbs the radiation, thus causing further warming and melting. The vicious cycle set in train melts the frozen segment of tundra that forms the permafrost. Reports suggest it is thinning by more than an inch a year, turning a once rock-solid fortress into floppy gunge. </p> <p>It doesn't take much imagination to conceive of the impact on the 90,000 Alaskans who live on top of the permafrost, most of them Eskimos or Inuit. The few roads that exist are now cracking and caving in, like Newtok's undulating boardwalk. Of the state's 213 Alaska Native villages, 184 are severely affected by erosion and flooding. Six have been classed in need of immediate help, and of those Newtok is top of the list.</p> <p>The village has felt the impact in so many ways. The piles on which houses like Peter John's are built used to be driven 8ft down; now they have to go 12ft - and even that isn't enough. As the permafrost melts, so the buildings sink, hence the odd angles. Every year villagers prop up their houses using hydraulic jacks in a futile attempt to level them. The reason the houses are all bowing down to the south now becomes clear: the warmth of the southern sunlight causes a disproportionate melting of the permafrost.</p> <p>The greatest threat comes from the water. The land on which Newtok is built is being swallowed up at an astonishing pace. With no permafrost as buttress, the tundra is as defenceless against the pounding waves as a sandcastle is to the rising tide. In Newtok's case, the waves do most damage in late summer, when they are whipped up in fierce storms that each year seem to grow more angry - a further symptom of global warming caused by changing weather patterns further north. The water undercuts the topsoil until it topples over in enormous clumps like the one I am standing beside. As a result, the sea is marching in the direction of the village at a rate of up to 90ft a year. It has already swallowed up a barge landing where the villagers used to moor their boats. Within two years, the first houses on the outskirts of the community are likely to be consumed, and Peter John's and all the rest will follow suit within a year or two of that.</p> <p>Stanley Tom, the village administrator, the modern equivalent of tribal leader, is spearheading the effort to relocate the entire community to a new home across the water. On the second morning of our visit he takes us out in his aluminium fishing boat to the new site - an island about nine miles to the south.</p> <p>It is here on Nelson Island that America's first global-warming refugee camp is being built. Three houses, neatly arranged on stilts in the style of Peter John's home back in Newtok, are already nearing completion. The villagers built them themselves, with the help of government grants, on land that is high enough up the hillside to be safe from the dangers of climate change - rising sea levels, flash flooding, erosion - for decades, if not centuries, to come. The first three homes have been assigned to village elders, including Stanley's father, Nick Tom. As Stanley shows us around the new houses, with their wood-burning stoves and mail-order catalogue kitchens, he talks of his huge relief that the move has begun. 'The elders are our advisers; they are our resources. We owe it to them to provide them with a life without trouble and worry. I can sleep at night now, knowing my father will be safe.'</p> <p>Also palpable is Tom's excitement about the natural abundance that he sees all around. The new village will be called Mertarvik, meaning 'getting water from a spring' - a reference to the ample supply of drinking water on the island. Wild musk ox have been spotted on the island and in the surrounding waters there is ample summer fishing of white fish, herring and halibut. The hillside on which the houses are rising is covered with bushes bearing berries that form an essential part of the Eskimos' diet. In late July or August they gather nagoonberries, cranberries, crowberries, blue-, black- and red-berries. They mix them with oil rendered from seal blubber and sugar to make akutaq - berry ice cream that is the centrepiece in winter festivities which help to while away the long, dark months. On our way back to Tom's boat he suddenly drops to his knees among a patch of salmonberries and declares them almost ripe and ready to pick. 'Oh man! These are really plump and nice,' he exclaims. 'These are the best! Better than shopping in a grocery store.'</p> <p>Back in Newtok, his excitement at the natural riches of the new village slumps into frustration as he relates the difficulties of organising the evacuation. The relocation of even such a small community has proved a massive undertaking, involving liaison with countless different government bodies and agencies. Tom has clearly had his fill of dealing with bureaucrats. 'There's a lot of pressure on me. The federal agencies are so slow, and I get stressed out. We're stuck in the middle: the old village is crumbling, because no one wants to spend money on a place that is about to move, but the new village isn't ready either.'</p> <p>We are talking over lunch in Tom's house at the far end of the village. Nearby you can still make out the outline of the old qasgiq, where the young Peter John used to sit at the feet of the elders. Tom serves a stew made from wild emperor geese shot by his sons, washed down with tundra tea, an infusion of a local bush that looks like rosemary. The feast fails to improve our host's mood. The worst thing, he says, has been the frequent remarks from outsiders that the villagers should all move to Bethel or Anchorage, or co-locate to one of the neighbouring villages that haven't been so affected by global warming. 'That will never happen. They wanted to move us to a barbed-wire camp in Anchorage, but we can't live the urban life. We are not used to it,' he says.</p> <p>At best, Newtok can expect only ambivalent support from the state authorities in Juneau, 1,000 miles away. Alaska's new lipstick-wearing pitbull megastar, Sarah Palin, is intellectually challenged when it comes to global warming. Soon after she was thrown into the spotlight as John McCain's presidential running mate she said: 'A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. I'm not one, though, who would attribute it to being man-made.' A few days later she tried to retract her statement, but her sentiments as a global-warming denier were crystal clear.</p> <p>The villagers have at least found in one official a powerful advocate. Sally Cox, an Alaska state planner, has rebutted the idea of paying the villagers to move into the cities. 'Often people say: why can't they just relocate, to another village or a town, to spare the government the huge cost of moving Newtok? But they have lived along this coast for millennia; their whole identity is embedded in their surroundings,' she tells me when we meet in Anchorage.</p> <p>Astonishing figures have been put on the cost of moving Newtok. One estimate put the total expense at $130m. Across the state of Alaska, the current bill to repair damage to infrastructure caused by global warming is already put at $3bn, and this could rise, according to some estimates, to $80bn by 2080. Looked at this way, the option of plonking the villagers of Newtok in some urban condo starts to appear more desirable. But Cox dismisses such thinking as alarmist. 'The figures are misleading. We are going to show in Newtok that it's not going to cost anything like as much.'</p> <p>Stanley Tom's point about the villagers being unprepared for urban life is spelled out the night his cousin Margaret Nickerson pays us a visit. She has decided to treat us to a classic Eskimo dinner. She pulls out a plastic bag and empties out an assortment of dried fish - herring, salmon, blackfish, pike, sheefish. She shows us how to eat it, dipping each piece in a bowl of clear yellowy liquid that turns out to be seal oil. As a final delicacy she produces a lump of black shrivelled flesh that resembles beef jerky. It is the dried ribs of a seal.</p> <p>As I chew gingerly on the meat, she tells me that the villagers go hunting for maklak - the bearded seal - every spring. The first catch of the year is marked by a great party where they celebrate by eating the seal's raw liver dipped in seal oil. She goes on to explain that the life of the village is arranged around the seasons. Yup'ik names for the months follow the pattern of hunting. April is Tengmiirvik or When the Birds Come, in reference to the five species of geese as well as tundra swans, ducks and seabirds that they hunt. March is Nayirciq - Birth of Seals. The ice-free summer is a time of fishing and berry-picking, and the autumn of tracking moose and caribou. In late September, before the ice sets in again, there is time to go after the berry-fattened fowl. </p> <p>It is remarkable how much of the traditional Eskimo way of life has survived the wave after wave of outside intervention that has tried to eradicate it. The first wave, from the 1700s, brought Russian fur hunters in search of beavers. Their legacy is still incorporated into the native language. The Yup'ik for white person is Kass'aq, a derivative of Cossack. </p> <p>Russian Orthodox priests gave way to Jesuit missionaries, who left an even greater impression, not least in the diseases they brought. A flu epidemic in 1900 halved the native Alaskan population in just three months. The old church we are using as a dormitory is lined with books on Jesuit theocracy. Local names, like Peter John, Stanley Tom, Margaret Nickerson, are all Jesuit impositions that now take preference over their native Yup'ik names (Peter John's traditional name is Miisaaq, but he rarely uses it). Other artefacts of the Jesuits are the Bible on Peter John's table and his Hohner Special 20 harmonica. He was given the instrument and taught how to use it by the missionaries. He plays it for us, starting with hymn music and then segueing into the Forties classic 'You Are My Sunshine'. </p> <p>There was one other legacy of the Jesuits. They abolished the qasgiq where he used to listen to the elders impart their wisdom. The missionaries considered the communal living quarters an affront to the nuclear family and had it torn down. </p> <p>After religion came education. The Yup'ik people were nomadic until the Seventies, travelling between summer and winter camps. But from 1976 Newtok became a sedentary community under instruction from the education authorities so that their children could benefit from year-round classes. They were taught in English from set texts written thousands of miles away in the big cities of America. Margaret says she remembers having her hands whipped at school because she was heard speaking Yup'ik. 'I used to look up at the teacher as he beat me and think to myself: \"Wait till I'm grown up, then it won't be your turn any more. It will be my turn.\"'</p> <p>Russians, Jesuits, pedagogues. The residents of Newtok are now feeling the impact of a fourth wave of outside interference. Only this time it is invisible: molecules of CO2 pumped into the air from the heavy industrial centres of continental America.</p> <p>It is a cruel irony that the Yup'ik people are among the first US citizens to feel the lash of climate change, as their way of life is deeply ingrained with respect for nature. As children, they are taught that they will be punished if they abuse the animals they hunt. 'Seals, birds, fish - they know what kind of person you are,' says Margaret. 'If they see you are the kind who will make good use of their meat, then they will make themselves available to you to be caught. But if they see you are the kind to waste it and leave it to rot, then they will hide and you will go hungry.'</p> <p>Peter John, sitting in his armchair, says that he was taught similar beliefs by the elders in the qasgiq. 'They would tell me: \"If you come across a sick or dying animal, you must care for it, put it somewhere dry. If you mistreat that animal, it will give you less and less.\"'</p> <p>It is true that the villagers are not blameless innocents in their relationship with the environment. On our way out of Newtok, back at Bethel airport, I notice a poster with a photograph of a magnificent bird soaring over the tundra. 'Help us save the emperor goose,' the poster says. 'It is endangered. Don't hunt it.' Then I remember the feast Stanley Tom cooked for us... emperor goose stew.</p> <p>It is true, too, that Eskimos have enjoyed the spoils of a fossil-fuel economy along with the rest of us. They have traded in their kayaks for motor boats. They have retired their huskies and replaced them with snowmobiles, saving themselves the labour of fishing for sticklebacks to feed the dogs. The combustion engine has allowed them to travel much greater distances over the pack ice in search of seals or caribou, while every week the plane brings in boxes of Cossack food - baked beans, chocolate, Coke - to spice up the repetitive winter diet. </p> <p>But none of that alters the fact that these first American refugees from global warming have been dealt a very poor hand. Most of the greenhouse gases responsible for the melting of the permafrost were pumped into the air not in Alaska itself, but in the industrialised regions of continental America, the 48 contiguous states that the Eskimos call 'lower 48ers'. Alaska is a major oil producer, but you won't find much of the black gold consumed in Newtok. 'Lower 48ers are doing most of the polluting that causes climate change,' says Stanley Tom. 'Compared with them, we are a little tiny scratch on the surface.'</p> <p>There is a wider lesson here for America. If the richest nation on earth cannot cope easily with relocating even such a minuscule community faced with imminent destruction from global warming, what hope is there when climate change really starts to bite? What happens to the 15m people living on the coast of Florida at risk from rising sea levels? Or the millions more in the desert across the American southwest facing devastating droughts?</p> <p>At least there are signs of hope for the residents of Newtok. The state of Alaska has just pledged $3m to build a barge landing and road up to the new site, and once those are in place the heavy work of building the new village can truly begin. The US army corps of engineers and the Marines have both promised to help. Things are finally on the move.</p> <p>Sally Cox is confident that they might be able to meet the target of transferring all Newtok's 320 residents to their new homes by 2012. It will be none too soon, judging by the relentless march of the water. 'If all the pieces fit together, I think we could do it,' she says.</p> <p>Just before we fly out of Newtok a beaming Stanley Tom calls us into his office and says he wants to show us something. He opens a box that has just arrived on the Cessna, and pulls from it a plan of Mertarvik. The map shows the prospective barge landing and a spanking new road curling up the hillside. The new village itself is shown on top of the hill, shaped like a boomerang. In the middle will be the communal buildings: a school, of course, a church certainly, and (whisper it) a communal building imbued with some of the spirit of the old qasgiq. The map shows three small icons like tiny crosses on the edge of the village. These will be the wind turbines they hope will meet most of the community's energy needs; unlike Mephistopheles the villagers have no desire to inflict their grief on others.</p> <p>One other feature of the plan stands out. There, on the hillside beneath the new houses, is an area marked on the map with cross hatches. It has a word stamped over it: Naunnaviit. I ask Stanley Tom what the word means. He replies: 'Berry patches'.</p>",
  "<p>Early in his career, Kevin Costner was compared with those all-American aw-shucks idols of a preceding generation, Gary Cooper and James Stewart. Now he has gone 100 per cent neo-Capra in Swing Vote, a movie for which he's said to have put up much of the money so it could be shown in time to influence this year's presidential election. He plays Bud Johnson, feckless, boozy, unemployed single father of a bright, civic-minded 12-year-old daughter in a small New Mexico town.</p> <p>When he doesn't turn up to vote in the presidential election, she secretly stands in and the voting machine jams.

  "<p>For the past few months an incongruous figure has passed through the airports of the Middle East and Europe: a senior Afghan cleric who defected from the Taliban. Bearded and in traditional dress, he has unsurprisingly needed the help of the Saudi Arabian and British intelligence services - among others - to pass unhindered between capitals. </p> <p>He has always travelled in great secrecy, his movements known only to a few individuals at the highest levels of the Afghan government, in Riyadh and among certain Western allies. His mission: to talk to the Taliban leadership about a possible peace deal.</p> <p>The backing given by the West to these talks is a measure of how badly things have gone wrong in Afghanistan, and how far Western governments are prepared to go to stabilise a deteriorating situation which is costing more in men, money and political capital than they ever imagined. The equally worrying situation in Pakistan, where the Taliban are largely based and where a separate but related insurgency has broken out, has given the initiative a new urgency. </p> <p>That the Saudi Arabians accepted the invitation of the Afghan government to sponsor the initiative this summer is a measure of how concerned those who govern the traditionally leading nation of the Sunni Muslim world are about Afghanistan and al-Qaeda and the consequences they might have for the rest of the Islamic world and beyond. It is also a measure of the esteem in which the Saudis are still held.</p> <p>This is not the first time the Saudi Arabians have brokered talks with the Taliban, and Western powers have been keen to get Riyadh more involved in Afghanistan for some time. The Saudis, along with Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, were the only states to recognise the hardline Islamic militia as rulers of Afghanistan in the Nineties. In 1998 they also nearly concluded a deal with Mullah Mohammed Omar, the reclusive leader of the Taliban, to hand over Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>For the West, the sponsorship of Riyadh is essential. Western efforts to negotiate with the Taliban have rarely brought any durable positive results. The reconciliation process launched by the Afghan government has brought in about 5,000 low-level fighters and a handful of mid-level commanders, but has never had the political backing or resources that was needed for it to become a genuine means of sapping the strength of the Taliban.</p> <p>But these most recent talks also show that, at the very least, some of the Taliban senior command are getting tired. 'They've been fighting for nearly seven years, living undercover, moving regularly, unable to go back to Afghanistan without risking a violent death. Despite the bellicose rhetoric and the successes of recent months, they have lost a lot of people and there is a certain degree of fatigue,' said one experienced Pakistan-based observer.</p> <p>The Saudi initiative has resulted in the submission of a list of demands by the Taliban to Kabul. One problem was that those demands keep changing, said one Afghan source. A second is the question of whether any potential agreement could be made to stick. </p> <p>'We could agree something with the high command that won't be put into action at a grass-roots level,' said an adviser to the Afghan President, Hamid Karzai. </p> <p>The Taliban demands are also unlikely to be acceptable to the Western powers, especially the US, which have bankrolled the effort to stabilise and reconstruct Afghanistan. Hekmat Karzai, director of a think tank in Kabul, said that although discussions with the Taliban 'might not be too difficult... getting the international community on board would be extremely hard'.</p> <p>Another problem would be convincing other ethnic groups in Afghanistan who suffered heavily under the Taliban regime to accept any deal. </p> <p>However, there is increasing acceptance among Western officials and strategists that some kind of political accommodation to at least divide the Taliban may be inevitable. There are also question marks over to what extent Taliban factions may be manipulated by elements within the Pakistani security establishment. However, Islamabad is unlikely to oppose moves to integrate senior Taliban figures into the political process in Kabul. </p> <p>Previous attempts to negotiate with the Taliban have been problematic. A controversial truce in Helmand province, where British troops are deployed, was widely criticised for handing the key town of Musa Qala back to the militants and necessitating a major operation to recapture it. </p> <p>In May, the former Afghan President Burnahuddin Rabbani said he had contacted the Taliban and received 'encouraging responses'. The Taliban published a statement on their website saying they would 'fight until the withdrawal of the last crusading invader', but added that 'the door for talks, understanding and negotiations will always be open' to 'mujahideen' such as Rabbani, who fought the Russians in the Eighties.</p> <p>One problem with the Saudi-sponsored talks so far is that the go-between has been unable to speak directly to Mullah Omar. However, an Afghan source described the initiative as 'a step in the right direction', whatever the result. 'Anything that might be an ice-breaker and might take us forward is welcome,' he said.</p>",
  "<p>In a tournament packed with memorable football, one of the best moments of Euro 2008 came almost at the very end. Eighty-two minutes into the final, with Spain looking for a second goal to kill off an outclassed Germany, Marcos Senna, the midfield workhorse of the Spanish team, picked up the ball in his own half and started to run with it. He effortlessly took it round one, two, three static Germans before passing out wide to the right. Then he kept running, and the ball kept moving sweetly through the team, until it came back to him, directly in front of goal, for a tap-in. But Senna, who has never scored for Spain, pulled up at the last moment, seemingly shocked to find himself so far upfield. When the ball arrived he was a yard short and, with a desperate lunge, swung at thin air and missed it altogether. It would have been the goal of the tournament, and a fitting climax for Senna, who was seen by many observers as the unsung hero of Spain's success, the man whose hard graft had allowed all the flair players around him to flourish.</p> <p>But something else stood out about the moment. It drew attention to the fact that there was at least one black player in the final. You may not think such a thing worthy of notice at an international tournament in 2008. But Senna was the only black player on the pitch, as he had been during Spain's semi-final against Russia, and the quarter-final against Italy. Germany's squad contained one black player, David Odonkor, but he arrived at the tournament still recovering from surgery to his right knee and his only contribution to the final came when he trotted up dutifully at the end to collect a loser's medal. The Russian and Italian squads had no black players at all. The same was true of the Croatia side that beat Germany in the group stages, and would probably have beaten them again in the semi-finals had they not already been knocked out on penalties by Turkey. Were it not for the Turks and for Marcos Senna, the latter stages of Euro 2008 would have turned into a whites-only affair.</p> <p>What had happened to the glorious example set by France's World Cup-winning team of 1998, with players of different colours combining to beat the equally diverse Brazilians in the final? Les Bleus seemed to point the way forward towards a new era of multi-ethnic, multicultural teams dominating the big international tournaments. But though the French reached the World Cup final again in 2006, they lost there to an all-white Italy, and at times Euro 2008 seemed to come from a period long before 1998, certainly once France had been knocked out in the group stages and Holland had flopped in the quarter-finals. As the tournament went on, there were fewer and fewer non-white faces to be seen either on the pitch or in the stands (it did not help that the event was taking place in Switzerland and Austria, two countries that have struggled more than most to adapt to racial diversity).</p> <p>It also did not help that England were not there. England have not taken an all-white squad to the finals of a major championship since the 1970 World Cup, though this is partly due to failing to make it to some tournaments (England would have had all-white teams at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups, had they qualified). This time, the all-white Croatia and Russia teams were there at the expense of a highly talented, racially diverse England side. Part of the problem, as so often in the past, was the manager - the somewhat less talented, extremely white Steve McClaren. The current England team are drawn almost exclusively from the Premier League, the most racially and culturally diverse league in Europe. But there was little of that on display at Euro 2008, either.</p> <p>If this tournament was a showcase for the best of European football, then it was of a very different kind from the Champions League final a month earlier. Nine of Chelsea's 18-man squad for that game were black. Manchester United started with three non-white players, with three more on the bench. It is hard to imagine an all-white team competing against the very best European club sides, who draw their talent from all over the world, regardless of race, creed or colour.</p> <p>Take Zenit St Petersburg, the only club in Europe openly to operate a whites-only transfer policy because, according to their coach, the fans would not accept black players in the team. When the Russian club won the 2007-08 Uefa Cup with a team of only white players, their Dutch coach Dick Advocaat admitted that they had reached the peak of what they could hope to achieve. 'The only players who can make Zenit stronger are dark-skinned,' Advocaat said. 'But for us it would be impossible. I would be happy to sign anyone, but the fans don't like black players.' </p> <p>What Advocaat said was shocking, because of his apparent passivity in the face of the fans' racism, but it was also a statement of the obvious. Football is the ultimate globalised business and any barriers that hold up the free movement of labour are being swept away by the competition to acquire the best players from anywhere they can be found. You cannot expect to compete at the highest level if you are going to be fastidious about who plays for your team. When Zenit paid Dynamo Moscow \u20ac30m this summer for Danny Alves, a 25-year-old midfielder who won his first cap for Portugal only in August, it showed how desperate the search for new talent can become if you rule out black players.</p> <p>Of course national-team football is not the same as club football. Countries can only pick players who qualify as national citizens and this inevitably limits the pool from which they can draw. But it does not need to limit it by much. Marcos Senna, for instance, is not Spanish, or at least not very Spanish. He was born and brought up in Brazil, only moving to Spain in 2002 when he joined Villarreal. Four years later, he acquired Spanish citizenship and was immediately included in Spain's squad for the 2006 World Cup.</p> <p>Cynics suggested that Senna had been fast-tracked into the otherwise all-white Spain side as cover for coach Luis Aragon\u00e9s, who had a reputation for less-than-enlightened views on race after he was overheard describing Thierry Henry as a 'black shit'. But Senna was not just there as window-dressing - he was there to strengthen the team. Moreover, according to John Carlin, a long-time observer of Spanish football and of racial politics, Spaniards are not much bothered either by Aragon\u00e9s's slips of the tongue - and Carlin points out that these tend to sound much worse in translation - or by the racial mix of the team. What they want, as all sports fans want, are winners. Senna speaks Spanish with a distinct Brazilian accent, but no one comments, or minds. He belongs to Spain now.</p> <p>Another native Brazilian, had he not been injured, might also have made an impact at Euro 2008. Eduardo, the Arsenal and Croatia centre-forward whose leg had been shattered during a Premier League match in February, might have been the difference between Croatia doing well at Euro 2008 and actually winning it. 'We missed Eduardo,' Slaven Bilic, Croatia's coach, said after his side lost to Turkey. 'Without him, we had problems in finishing.' Eduardo Alves da Silva was born and brought up in Rio de Janeiro, where he was spotted by scouts for Dinamo Zagreb, who brought him to their youth academy as a 16-year-old in 1999. Three years later Eduardo took Croatian citizenship, and two years after that he started playing for the national team. Croatian fans adore him and do not care that he does not look or sound the same as the other players in the team. The view among Croats is that since they found Eduardo and nurtured him, he belongs to them now - if the Brazilians failed to spot his talent, more fool them. Eduardo has returned the compliment by marrying a Croat and happily embracing his new national identity. </p> <p>Croatia's squad at Euro 2008 looked and sounded to the outside world like natural-born Croats. But some of them aren't. Like many of those at the tournament, the players were drawn from all over. Some were born or brought up in Switzerland (Ivan Rakitic, Mladen Petric) or in Germany (Ivan Klasnic, Robert Kovac) and one, Josip Simunic, was born in Australia and trained at the expense of the Australian taxpayer at the Australian Institute of Sport before choosing at the age of 23 to play for Croatia, the country of his parents' birth. Still, the Swiss and the Germans cannot complain. The Switzerland squad had three players of Turkish descent, plus one born in each of Bosnia, Kosovo and Cape Verde. The Germany squad had three players born in Poland (Miroslav Klose, Lukas Podolski, Piotr Trochowski) as well as the Brazil-born Kevin Kuranji, who could have qualified to play for Brazil, Hungary or Panama before finally opting for Germany. Meanwhile, Germans were very conscious that the Turkey team contained Germany-born players (Hamit Altintop, Hakan Balta) who could just as well have been turning out for them. </p> <p>Focusing on the question of race - where were all the black players? - misses the real story of Euro 2008, which is the relentless breaking down of national boundaries as players (and their parents) move across the globe acquiring multiple national identities along the way. This is where the France team of 1998 may have laid a false trail. Behind the celebration of French success was a kind of inverted racism that often lurks behind celebrations of black success in sport.</p> <p>It is often assumed that teams with a higher proportion of black players will inevitably come to dominate football, as they have other sports, particularly in the United States, because of the greater natural athleticism of black players. This is the thought that often lay unspoken behind the idea that a team from Africa were bound to win the World Cup sooner or later. Once African teams got their act together, so the thinking went, there would be no stopping them. The spectacular success in 1998 of a France side with players from Africa and Caribbean territories such as Guadeloupe seemed to confirm that view. When France went on to win Euro 2000, where Germany, with an all-white team, produced the worst performance at a major tournament in their history (even losing to Kevin Keegan's England), coach Erich Ribbeck was heard to muse in fairly impolitic terms about what had gone wrong. 'We just didn't have the colonies,' he said.</p> <p>Ribbeck was not the only person saying the unsayable at the turn of the century. In 1999 American journalist Jon Entine published Taboo: Why Black Athletes Are Better And Why We're Afraid To Talk About It, which tried to address in non-hysterical terms the rise of black athletes across many sports and any possible connection to biology. Entine drew on statistics from sprinting (at the time he was writing, black athletes held 494 of the top 500 fastest 100metres times), long-distance running, which is disproportionately dominated by Kenyans, and American sports more generally, particularly the NBA, where a racial breakdown that had been 80 per cent white and 20 per cent black during the 1960s had become 85 per cent black by the end of the 1990s. Entine also used football to illustrate his thesis that black players have natural advantages. 'The Netherlands national team,' he wrote, 'which made it to the semi-finals in the '98 World Cup, includes stars from Suriname and is about one-third black. France, the winners, has a large contingent of players of African descent.' He went on: 'As the world playing field continues to level, natural abilities are more likely to come to the fore.' By 'natural abilities', Entine meant the abilities of players who are black.</p> <p>But Entine was wrong, and so was Ribbeck. As football has become a more truly globalised sport, it has not come to be dominated by black players, and it turns out that Germany did not need to have had colonies in order to recover from the humiliations of 2000 (what they needed, among other things, was a better manager). Instead, football has come to be dominated by players whose success is not determined by their skin colour, but by their abilities. Thankfully, football is not like the NBA or the NFL, where affluent whites pay to watch athletic blacks. Football is a sport in which greatness can come from all sorts of surprising places and in which all sorts of skills are valued. Who are the greatest football players of the modern era, the top five never mind the top 500? Perhaps Pel\u00e9, Cruyff, Maradona, Zidane, Ronaldo (the black one, not the white one). What have racial stereotypes got to do with that list, except to be mocked by it? Even now, if asked to pick a world XI to take on all-comers, it would be possible to come up with a convincing team consisting entirely of white players (maybe with Torres and Rooney up front, two of the whitest men on the planet), and an equally plausible team of black players (perhaps with Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto'o leading the line). Football is the world's favourite sport in part because it is a sport that can truly transcend racial differences.</p> <p>Kevin Hylton, the author of a new book, 'Race' and Sport: Critical Race Theory, says that it is all too easy to view sport through outdated and naive racial categories, what he calls 'the binary and static categories of black and white'. We need to get beyond this, he says, and see 'just how dynamic and diverse racial and cultural identities can be'. International football increasingly helps to illustrate this, in ways that Entine entirely missed because he was seeing everything through the prism of American sport, where racial identities are invariably reinforced through sport (basketball is a 'black' sport, as ice hockey is a 'white' sport) rather than being broken down by it.</p> <p>It is true that the division is not always black versus white. Before basketball became a black sport, it was seen as a predominantly Jewish sport, because it was the game impoverished Jews invariably chose as a way out of the ghetto. But this socio-cultural explanation did not stop many commentators looking for a biological explanation. 'The reason I suspect that basketball appeals to the Hebrew with his Oriental background,' a writer for the New York Daily News opined in the 1930s, 'is that the game places a premium on an alert, scheming mind, flashy trickiness, artful dodging and general smart aleckness.' It is worth remembering this when commentators say today that blacks dominate basketball because it is a game that values speed and the ability to jump.</p> <p>It is one of the minor tragedies of American history that the country never properly embraced 'soccer', a sport that might have been best equipped to cut across some of the static and binary racial divisions of American society. When Jon Entine published Taboo, he agreed to take part in a discussion with the Reverend Jesse Jackson on CNN. This was brave of him, and the exchange was not a happy one. Jackson was furious with Entine for reinforcing racial prejudice rather than looking at all the social forces that combine to distort the level playing field of sport. For Jackson, basketball was a sport that did not so much favour black athletes as pigeonhole them. </p> <p>Entine accepted that cultural factors play a large part in determining which sports attract which sorts of athletes, but insisted that to turn a blind eye to the biological differences was simply to ignore the facts. He also acknowledged that it was a mistake to reduce everything to the simple binary of black versus white - the black athletes who dominate sprinting, for example, are of West African descent, whereas the long-distance runners are invariably East African. 'I don't believe in the concept of race, Reverend Jackson,' Entine insisted, 'and I don't think blacks can be lumped into one population because of skin colour.' </p> <p>But Jackson was having none of it. 'The one thing I'm convinced of,' he declared by way of conclusion, 'is whenever the playing field is even, the rules are public, the goals are clear, and there is a work ethic, we all do exceptionally well.'</p> <p>What Jackson needed to prove his case was the example of football, where what he says is demonstrably true. Of course, football has had more than its share of racism and stereotyping blighting the chances of players from different ethnic backgrounds, but when the playing field is even, then anyone can succeed. Kevin Hylton's book has on its cover one of the most famous of all football photographs, the embrace between Pel\u00e9 and Bobby Moore after the Brazil v England game at the 1970 World Cup. Both men are stripped to the waist, both smiling, both displaying an obvious mutual respect. They have different physiques, Pel\u00e9 shorter and more muscular, the blond and pale-skinned Moore taller, skinnier, slightly less athletic-looking. 'I had serious doubts about putting this picture on the cover,' Hylton tells me. 'It's the ultimate binary image, black against white. Also I don't want people to forget the racism that Pel\u00e9 suffered throughout his career, from inside Brazil as well as from the outside world.' Still, it is a wonderful photograph, because of what it says about the scope football provides for players of different types to excel, and to compete on equal terms. There is a similarly celebrated basketball photo from the late 1980s, which shows the black Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and the white Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics facing each other, cautiously but with mutual respect, as befits the two premier players of their era. But that photo seems to come from another age, and to mark the passing of basketball from an era in which one type of player could excel to an era that would favour another. Jordan versus Bird seems to belong to the past, whereas Pel\u00e9 versus Moore is a timeless confrontation in football terms.</p> <p>The peerless Brazil team of 1970 contained players of every different shade of skin. But it also symbolised the racism that lurks in the background of all sports, including football, including in Brazil. The goalkeeper of that team - F\u00e9lix - was white, because Brazil did not pick black goalkeepers, a result of prejudices that lingered on from the disaster of the 1950 World Cup final, which Brazil lost unexpectedly to Uruguay. As David Goldblatt writes in his magnificent history of global football, The Ball Is Round: 'When the time for recriminations did come, the scapegoats were the left-half Bigode, defender Juvenal and goalkeeper Barbosa. All were condemned in the press as cowards, lacking fibre and discipline - and all three were black. Barbosa was singled out for special levels of opprobrium which endured until his poverty-stricken death 50 years later.' Brazil did not pick a black goalkeeper until Dida in 1995. As Goldblatt says of 1950: 'The multiracial, confident, progressive Brazil that [had been] conjured from football was dissolved in an acid bath of racism, self-doubt and self-loathing.'</p> <p>Skin colour matters in football not because of what it says about the abilities of the players, but because of what it can say about the distorted perspectives of people who do not play the game but merely watch it, or administer it, or finance it. Some countries have started looking to Africa to bolster their national teams by encouraging players to change nationality in return for the greater rewards on offer. This is not because African players are naturally better. It is because African players are often more vulnerable to these sorts of offers, and more easily exploited by anyone willing to be unscrupulous about whom they recruit.</p> <p>Tom Vernon, the Manchester United scout in Africa and founder of the Right To Dream football academy in Ghana, says 'the continent is currently being swept for talent' by some national federations looking to naturalise promising young players. The most conspicuous example of this is Qatar, whose Aspire academy has a large budget devoted to hosting trials in every country in Africa with a view to offering the resources of the Qatari Football Federation to the best they can find, and with the prospect of Qatari citizenship included. The attractions of this arrangement for young African players are obvious, particularly when they come from impoverished countries that lack a clear national identity in football terms, or are held back by a corrupt national federation in the country of their birth. 'Still,' Vernon says, 'it's outrageous what's going on.' The ultimate aim of the Qataris is to have a properly competitive team at the 2014 World Cup, though what that will mean in practice is a team that is almost entirely of African origin, with little or no connection to Qatar itself beyond what the Aspire academy has given them. </p> <p>But it is not just the Qataris - other countries have started to fast-track the naturalisation of African players, including some of the smaller European nations. The main motivation here tends to come from big European club sides, particularly in England, who want African players with European Union passports in order to get round potential problems with work permits. The easiest way to do this is to farm the players out to feeder clubs in Benelux or Scandinavian countries, where they can acquire a passport after a brief period of residency, and then be available to move to the UK. But, as Vernon says: 'This also provides a chance for these countries to transform the make-up of their national teams. In some ways, places like Luxembourg are missing an opportunity here.' But if they take that opportunity, they risk a backlash from their own fans, never mind those of other countries, including the African countries of origin of their new players, given the mockery this would make of the idea of belonging to a national team.</p> <p>When it works well, as it has in the cases of Marcos Senna and Eduardo, the naturalisation of overseas players can be a force for good, breaking down prejudices and broadening horizons. But it needs to be handled carefully. The Poles have a record of fast-tracking foreigners into the national team - they did it with Nigeria-born Emmanuel Olisadebe before qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, and they did it again before Euro 2008, with Brazil-born Roger Guerreiro transformed into a Pole just two months before the finals, having only been in the country since 2006. Not only did this smack of desperation, but it stirred up nationalist sentiment in a country where race relations are fragile at best. The racism of some fans should not be a reason for holding back when selecting the best players to turn out for Poland, any more than it should hold back Zenit St Peterburg in the transfer market, but clumsy attempts to play the system can help to generate intolerance instead of overcoming it.</p> <p>What is important, though, is to see that this is not about race, whatever the racists may like to think. It is about the changing face of national identity. The next World Cup will take place in South Africa in 2010. It is not inconceivable that the final could be contested by an all-white European team and an all-black African one. That could appear, in South Africa of all places, to be a retrograde step. But it need be nothing of the sort. It would be a sign that good football teams can be any colour. If an African side do finally win the tournament in 2010, it will not be because Africans are naturally more talented, but simply because the rest of the world have finally allowed the African continent home advantage, the single most important factor in determining the winner of World Cups. </p> <p>Moreover, as Kevin Hylton says, 'we need to look beyond \"whiteness\" and \"blackness\" to see all the diversity that lies behind those static categories'. All-black African teams are no more homogenous than all-white European ones. Players move, their parents move, and countries often naturalise players born or brought up elsewhere. 'West Africa is not so different from Europe,' Tom Vernon says. The boundaries between some of the strongest African teams - Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, Cameroon - can be as fluid as they are in Europe when it comes to player registration and the best sides are often the ones that draw on the widest pool of talent.</p> <p>What about England? To qualify for 2010, England need to emerge from a group with Croatia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Andorra. The England team are long used to suffering racial abuse in eastern Europe and this group looks pretty ominous in that respect - Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan have never fielded a black player between them. During the team's 4-1 win in Zagreb in early September, Emile Heskey was targeted by some in the crowd - with Eduardo out injured, things may be slipping back in Croatia. </p> <p>England have always led the way in fielding multiracial teams - ever since Viv Anderson was first picked in 1978 - but, in some other respects, they are starting to be left behind. Other major European national teams are looking to register players with multiple nationalities as young as possible in their national federations. The Polish FA are trawling German youth teams for possible Poland players of the future. The Germans, realising what they have missed out on, are now actively recruiting among the Turkish community. In Spain, a battle has long been under way for one of the world's most talented teenagers, Barcelona's Bojan Krkic, son of a Serbian footballer and a Spanish nurse. Krkic is a product of the Barcelona youth system that also developed Lionel Messi, a player many Spaniards wish they had claimed as their own after he moved from Argentina at the age of 13.</p> <p>The big English clubs are not in the habit of searching the world for young talent to train up in Britain; instead, they buy in established players from abroad, whose national affiliation is invariably already fixed. So the national team have fewer opportunities to look outside home-grown communities for future England players. But the new influx of immigrants from eastern Europe means that, too, may be about the change. Will the English FA also soon be in competition with the Polish FA to secure talented teenagers born there but brought up here? Like everyone else, the England team are going to have to try to broaden their talent base in any way they can. The current England team member who probably best reflects the sort of diversity we should get used to in the future is Owen Hargreaves, who was born in Canada to a Welsh mother and an English father, and moved to Germany with Bayern Munich at the age of 16, where he remained until his transfer to Manchester United last year. Hargreaves is white, but he is a lot less English than any of the non-white players who have appeared for England over the past 30 years. Almost nothing about the future of international football is simply black and white any more. </p> <h2>Double Identities: The teams they could have played for</h2> <p><strong>Manuel Almunia</strong> Spain and England </p> <p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa </strong>DR Congo and Portugal</p> <p><strong>Jean-Alain Boumsong</strong> Cameroon and France</p> <p><strong>Philippe Senderos</strong> Spain, Serbia and Switzerland</p> <p><strong>Patrice Evra</strong> Senegal and France</p> <p><strong>Colin Kazim-Richards</strong> England and Turkey</p> <p><strong>Patrick Vieira</strong> Cape Verde, Senegal and France</p> <p><strong>Owen Hargreaves </strong>Wales, Canada, England and Germany</p> <p><strong>Gabriel Agbonlahor</strong> England, Nigeria and Scotland</p> <p><strong>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</strong> Bosnia, Croatia and Sweden</p> <p><strong>Kevin Kuranyi</strong> Brazil, Panama, Hungary and Germany</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Runciman's essay on 'Home Advantage' appeared in February's OSM</p>",
  "<p><strong>Oki-Nami</strong><br>6 New Road, Brighton, East Sussex<br>(01273 773 777)<br>Meal for two, including drinks and service, \u00a370</p> <p>A year or so back in Tokyo I ate at a French restaurant of such unremitting awfulness, such gothic catastrophe - think green bean soup with lavender ice cream, and lamb served so thin and pink it looked like sweaty ham - that, in between trying to identify the right waiter to stab with a spoon as an act of revenge, I fell to thinking about the cultural accessibility of different culinary traditions. Or, to put it another way, was it unrealistic of me to hope that Japanese people could cook good French food? This was an uncomfortable thought, verging on prejudice, until I turned it around. Would I eat at a sushi bar run by a bunch of white boys from Wimbledon? Well no, I wouldn't. Or at least I'd get everything I deserved if I did.</p> <p>Here's the point. Japanese food, like open heart surgery, is not something just anybody can turn their hand to. There is a simplicity to it, a minimalism which leaves nowhere to hide. Either you know what you're doing or it's a disaster. Brighton's Oki-Nami is a disaster. I will admit I had my doubts from the off. The chef's name is Mike Dodd. Here, of course, we again confront those uncomfortable questions about whether it is possible to cook well outside of your own culinary tradition. So let's assume nationality really has nothing to do with it, which means we must fall back on the alternative: Dodd runs a really lousy Japanese kitchen. As in, serving some of the worst Japanese food it has ever been my misfortune to eat - or not, because we didn't finish everything.</p> <p>There was one reason for thinking it might not be awful. One of the investors in the restaurant, an attractive white-slatboard space which manages to combine a Japanese and Brighton aesthetic, is DJ Norman Cook. Aka Fatboy Slim. Presumably Cook invested in the restaurant because he likes Japanese food. And presumably that's because, being a wealthy man, he's eaten lots of the good stuff. Whether, given that experience, he's satisfied with what's coming out of this place, God only knows, but I certainly wasn't.</p> <p>First the good things. Most importantly, the fish itself in the sushi was of pretty good quality, well cut, served at the right temperature and competitively priced. There's a nice list of affordable sakes, and the teas are great. After that, oh dear. The rice under the fish was grossly overcooked unto a stodge and served fridge cold. It was like eating slices of yesterday's unsweetened rice pudding. Slices of unagi - eel - which should be grilled just before serving so they are still warm, the skin crisp, the oils running, were also served completely cold. If I wanted to eat frigid, slippery, fishy stuff I'd raid my cat's lunch.</p> <p>This course was at least better than the selection of small plates that followed, all of which reached the table tepid at best. Tempuraed king prawns were like something from the chip shop and left puddles of oil behind on their dimpled plate. Pork dumplings - gyoza - should have been light and crisp. These were hard and solid. If I had thrown one of these at someone I could have done real damage. I was tempted. A stir-fry of mushrooms was a salty, sludgy mess. Worst of all was the chicken yakitori, the skewered meat again served at room temperature under a slick of industrial-tasting sauce which appeared to have been poured on at the end, cold.</p> <p>I couldn't help wondering whether the person who had cooked this had ever eaten the real thing, or whether they had just looked at a picture of the real thing. Or perhaps a five-year-old's drawing of the real thing. It was so far from being right, in the way that Tokyo is so far from Brighton. It was even further from being nice, as was dessert - a claggy green tea cheesecake and, worse still, a millionaire's cake as imagined by a pauper. A brick-like biscuit base. A sludgy layer of caramel, and on top of that a slab of hard, cheap chocolate holding two whorls of sweet whipped cream that looked like they had come from a can. These were desserts served by someone who doesn't like dessert. Or customers. Or life. There are many gags that could be made in a restaurant review involving Fatboy Slim, and doubtless the headline writers on this piece have already done so. So I'll leave it at this. As a DJ Norman Cook has my undying admiration. Right now, as a restaurateur, he sucks.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The actor Paul Newman, who has died aged 83, became so famous for his dazzling looks, and the bluest eyes in the business, that it is impossible to think of him as other than a celebrity. </p> <p>Yet his many faceted, contradictory character renders the star image superficial. He was also a notable producer-director, a racing car enthusiast, a political activist and a philanthropist, counted as the person who had distributed more money - in relation to his own wealth - than any other American during the 20th century.</p> <p>He claimed to be happiest behind the wheel of a racing car and noted that his athleticism found its perfect outlet in this sport. As a producer and co-founder of several companies, he was responsible for many of his own films and directed six features, four of them starring his second wife, Joanne Woodward. One of these gained him an Oscar nomination \u2014 one of eight, although he waited until 1986 for the coveted best actor statuette. He received two other Academy Awards, an oddly premature lifetime achievement award in 1985 and the Jean Herscholt award for his philanthropic work in 1993.</p> <p>It is possible that this work may outlive his other achievements. In 1982 he founded - initially as a modest venture - the company Newman's Own, producing products such as pasta sauces based on his own home recipes. He devoted the company's entire profits - around $250m to date - to causes throughout the world.</p> <p>Newman was actively concerned with some of the projects, including the Hole in the Wall Gang summer camps, devoted to underprivileged youngsters. He never gave up social concerns, and, in 1999, returned to the theatre in the two-hander Love Letters, where he and his wife raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help land conservation in Connecticut.</p> <p>He found time for political activities, including donating $1m to the leftist magazine The Nation, long-term involvement in civil rights issues and support for Democratic candidates. That said, his fame inevitably rested on his screen career. The star of more than 50 features, including 11 opposite Woodward, Newman, with his blue eyes, insouciant smile, and a handsome and eternally slim figure, was the idol of countless fans. His characters, such as the leads in Hud (1963) and Cool Hand Luke (1967) made him internationally famous and allowed him to enjoy the comfortable, although unostentatious, lifestyle available only to the very rich, with a main home in Connecticut, a Manhattan penthouse and a base in California.</p> <p>Newman was born in Shaker Heights, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, the younger son of a sports store owner. His father was of Jewish-German descent and his mother was a Catholic whose family came from Hungary. She became a Christian Scientist when Paul was just five but her new beliefs did not impinge on the family and later in life Newman chose to follow none of their beliefs but, when asked, opted \"for Jewishness because I considered it more challenging\".</p> <p>His acting debut, aged seven, was as the court jester in Robin Hood at school. He left Shaker Heights high school in 1943 and went on briefly to Ohio University, in Athens, where he was expelled, supposedly after an incident involving a keg of beer and the rector's car. </p> <p>His comfortable life and good looks were proving a mixed blessing and wayward behaviour ended in trouble for drunkenness; there were even a couple of very brief stints behind bars. He had a lifelong liking for practical jokes.</p> <p>From 1943 to 1946 Newman served as a US navy torpedo bomber radio operator. He graduated from the liberal arts Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, in 1949 and that year married for the first time \u2014 to Jacqueline Witte \u2014 and returned to Cleveland to manage the family store. His father died in 1950. But his destiny was to be an actor and he and his wife and son moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where Newman attended Yale Drama School. He had ambitions to be a drama teacher, but he was spotted at Yale by New York agents, moved to New York and had a period at the Actors' Studio. He did a lot of television in that decade, debuting in an episode of the science fiction series Tales of Tomorrow in 1952. More importantly, chance led to a highly successful Broadway debut, originally as an understudy, in William Inge's play Picnic (1953-54) \u2014 where he met another understudy, Woodward.</p> <p>By then Hollywood had beckoned, but its call came via one of the most calamitous screen debuts ever recorded. The Silver Chalice (1954) miscast him in a toga, and so dismayed him that years later he paid for advertisements urging viewers not to watch it on television. He learned one valuable lesson \u2014 \"avoid frocks\" \u2014 and concentrated (except for westerns) on modern characters, often those under stress. There were few conventional romantic roles or comedies.</p> <p>Recovery from his disastrous movie debut came back on Broadway in 1955, playing a gangster in The Desperate Hours. There was also plenty of television, including The Battler (1955), a Hemingway adaptation, directed by Arthur Penn, with Newman as a brain-damaged boxer, and a baseball story, Bang the Drum Slowly (1956).</p> <p>Back in Hollywood he had famously lost out to James Dean when Elia Kazan screen tested them both for the lead in East of Eden. But in 1956, following Dean's death, the role of the boxer Rocky Graziano \u2014 earmarked for Dean \u2014 in Somebody Up There Likes Me fell to him. That year, too, he starred as a brainwashed army officer in the post-Korean war drama, The Rack. Even the couple of duds which followed could not take the shine off his success. In 1957 Newman filmed The Long Hot Summer (1958), from a William Faulkner story, alongside Woodward. By January 1958 Newman was divorced from Witte, and had married his co-star.</p> <p>Two more films that year confirmed his stardom. The Left Handed Gun featured Newman as Billy the Kid. They play on which it was based, written by Gore Vidal \u2014 a close friend of Newman and Woodward \u2014 had depicted Billy as gay. This theme became less explicit as the work filtered through TV, where Newman had first performed it in 1955, and in to Arthur Penn's screen version where Billy's relationship with his murdered mentor is left unclear.</p> <p>The same thing happened with Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, where Newman played the tortured Brick opposite Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie. As on Broadway, the homosexual theme was obscured and the reason for Brick's marital chaos never made clear. Newman meanwhile won an Oscar nomination. In 1959 he returned to Broadway, and Tennessee Williams, in Sweet Bird of Youth. After that he effectively abandoned the theatre for 33 years, to the dismay of his wife, who believed that stage discipline would make him less reliant on his charm and the mannerisms that were \u2014 for some critics \u2014 becoming over-familiar.</p> <p>In 1960 Newman starred in Otto Preminger's vast and lumbering epic about the birth of Israel, Exodus. A year later he played a jazz musician in the intriguing Paris Blues.</p> <p>Sadly, over the course of his career Newman worked with few major directors on their best films. His work with Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, John Huston and Robert Altman was on their lesser movies. The great exception was Robert Rossen, whose classic adaptation of Walter Tevis's novel The Hustler (1961) gave Newman his most complex early role and marked a turning point in his career. As Fast Eddie, a poolroom shark, whose innate corruptness leads to a brutal come-uppance, Newman crystallised his screen persona \u2014 a blend of vulnerability and bravado, criminality and redemption \u2014 in a performance of new found maturity. It was left to Bafta to give him its award as best actor, while the Academy passed him over for the second time. It was not until he played Eddie again opposite Tom Cruise in The Color of Money (1986) that he received the Oscar.</p> <p>Rossen aside, Newman fared better \u2014 especially in commercial terms \u2014 with sturdy middleweight talents such as Sidney Lumet, Martin Ritt and Richard Brooks in films where what the critic Andrew Sarris memorably described as \"strained seriousness\" seemed to suit Newman's own demeanour. The Hustler initiated the period that brought Newman fame and fortune, in title roles that became part of cinema legend \u2014 among them Ritt's Hud (1963), Harper (1966), Cool Hand Luke (1967) and Butch in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) with Robert Redford. In 10 years he starred in 18 films, as well as directing his first and best movie, Rachel, Rachel (1968), starring Woodward.</p> <p>Curiosities of that period included a reworking of Kurosawa's Rashomon, retitled Outrage (1964), in which the Japanese bandit is transposed to Mexico. Newman relished another character role in an intelligent western, Hombre (1967), directed by Ritt from an Elmore Leonard story. It was compensation for Peter Ustinov's Lady L (1965) with Sophia Loren, the Hitchcock cold war thriller Torn Curtain (1966), opposite Julie Andrews and the comedy The Secret War of Harry Frigg (1968).</p> <p>He looked far happier in the Indianapolis 500 motor racing drama Winning (1969), by which time his fee for any one of his numerous movies far exceeded the $500,000 he had paid years before to extricate himself from a studio contract. Importantly, the choices he made were his own, even if there were, inevitably, duds along the way.</p> <p>Many characters which he played to popular acclaim were less than admirable. Hud is selfish, Luke arrogant, Harper callous and Butch a killer. Other characters were self-obsessed (the racing driver) or wilful and on the margins of society. To such creations, even mean spirited ones, he brought a strength that made him \u2014 alongside Brando \u2014 the acceptable anti-hero of the period.</p> <p>By the 1970s Newman had become more overtly political. He was one of the narrators of the documentary King: a Filmed Record \u2026 from Montgomery to Memphis (1970), about Martin Luther King, and also in that year starred in the anti-radical right drama WUSA. His support for the King documentary was one aspect of his support for civil rights. He also campaigned against the war in Vietnam and had supported Eugene McCarthy's 1968 bid for the presidency. He was vigorous in his opposition to Richard Nixon and proud of being among the top 20 on Nixon's \"most hated\" list.</p> <p>Newman never lost his commitment to liberal causes, but like his exact contemporary Charlton Heston, whose raucous support for the gun lobby, and the right, diametrically opposed Newman's philosophy, he found that overt politicising sometimes misfired. People came to see him, not always to support the cause. He found greater satisfaction as part of the team involved with his charitable foundation.</p> <p>At the height of his fame Newman formed one of several production companies he was to be associated with. Barbra Streisand, Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen and later Dustin Hoffman joined him to set up the First Artists title in 1969. Each agreed to make three movies and Newman \u2014 possibly with less ego than most of his partners \u2014 fulfilled his promise.</p> <p>In 1972, Pocket Money revived his Luke character in all but name. He then made The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean, distractedly directed by his friend Huston during the early throes of one of his many marriages. Finally, in 1975, he revived the Lew Harper detective in a rather sadistic thriller, The Drowning Pool. Soon after, First Artists was wound up and the actor found himself looking for roles that suited a star now into handsome middle age.<br>His box office credibility had been maintained by two smash hits The Sting (1973), which reunited him with Redford, and The Towering Inferno (1974), where he received top billing.</p> <p>Of his two films with Robert Altman, Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or, Sitting Bull's History Lesson (1976) is by far the more successful, but the bizarre futuristic drama Quintet (1979) ended the decade disastrously, a flop compounded by the awfulness of When Time Ran Out (1980). His fans had not taken to the raucous and foul-mouthed Slap Shot (1977), another work which had indicated Newman's search for more original material.</p> <p>He had returned to direction in 1971, salvaging the outdoor drama Sometimes a Great Notion. The following year he produced and directed a vehicle for his wife and daughter Nell, The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds. He was to render her better service 15 years later when he directed The Glass Menagerie (1987), \"to immortalise Joanne's performance\". His other stints as director were a competently made television film, from the play The Shadow Box (1980), and four years later a more personal work Harry &amp; Son. This movie, which gave him his only writing credit (plus star, producer and director), was a highly charged family drama about the difficult relationship between Harry and his teenage son.</p> <p>The subject was almost too close to Newman, whose first child Scott had died of a drug overdose in 1978. Newman felt deeply distressed by his death and the overwrought Harry &amp; Son meant more to its creator than to the general audience.</p> <p>During the 1980s Newman settled into character roles and in 1981 enjoyed success as a tough street cop in Fort Apache, the Bronx. But the cop, like his crane driver Harry, asked us to believe in Newman as a working-class hero and lacked the credibility he brought to Absence of Malice (1981) and The Verdict (1982). Both earned him Oscar nominations. The latter had a screenplay by David Mamet and presented him with a juicy role as a fading, alcoholic lawyer. A part which, as his director Sidney Lumet remarked, required only minimal research. </p> <p>The star had an acknowledged taste for alcohol and despite giving up spirits in mid-career (with a lapse after his son's death), enjoyed his beer and displayed a deep appreciation of vintage wine. I recall having lunch with him one day at his London hotel suite when he particularly liked a white Burgundy. He called the restaurant and ordered the rest of the case to be put in his refrigerator.</p> <p>Bizarrely, his intense performance in The Verdict failed to gain him an Oscar \u2014 a fact taken harder by his wife than by the star. It was suggested that his politics and residence on the east coast since 1962 had alienated him from the conservative Hollywood establishment. In compensation \u2014 after he had taken a year off to concentrate on his motor racing \u2014 he was awarded, aged 60, an honorary Oscar for his lifetime achievement, normally reserved for the truly venerable within the profession. The following year he chose not to attend the awards ceremony \u2014 only to win best actor for The Color of Money.</p> <p>Alongside the accolades, there were other less successful movies, such as Blaze and Fat Man and Little Boy (both 1989). In the former he starred as Earl Long, the philandering 1950s governor of Louisiana. His necessarily strident performance failed to ignite a dull movie. The second work personalised the story of General Groves, the belligerently professional officer who oversaw the Manhattan Project which developed the allied atomic weapons programme. Duller than either of these was Mr &amp; Mrs Bridge (1990), in which he and Woodward wilted under James Ivory's direction. </p> <p>Newman took a long time out of acting and away from conventional Hollywood. Then, in 1994, he had a villainous supporting role in the Coen brothers' satire on big business The Hudsucker Proxy and the lead in Nobody's Fool. Both reminded audiences of his talent. In the latter, he played a grouch unable to relate to his own son but drawn to his shy grandson \u2014 a touching relationship which, the director Robert Benton noted, drew heavily on Newman's own character. The performance gained him another Oscar nomination. Despite this success, he again stayed away from film work except to narrate Baseball (1994) and a 1997 TV series, Super Speedway.<br>In 1995, aged 70, he took part in the 24-hour Daytona endurance race \u2014 becoming the oldest person ever to complete the event, capping his 1979 success when he and his co-driver finished second in the 24-hour Le Mans race. After Daytona, he agreed to quit professional racing and to the relief of his wife opted for his Volvo.</p> <p>Four years after Nobody's Fool, Benton coaxed him back to the studio to star in Twilight (1998), to play an ageing, cynical private detective with a drink problem. The part was tailor-made for Newman, who brought a gravel-voiced and somewhat melancholy charm to the character. Despite a fine cast, the film had a tired feel to it and showed signs of severe post-production pruning.<br>The movie marked a flurry of activity for Newman and he followed it with Message in a Bottle (1999), a tear-jerker in which he played Kevin Costner's crotchety, alcoholic father \u2014 scooping the best reviews, not least for his commanding presence, but also for a willingness to play his age. He again took third billing to decidedly lesser names in Where the Money Is (1999), proving, if proof were needed, that after decades of stardom he was a dedicated professional first and a star a long way second. </p> <p>Newman returned to a substantial film role in Sam Mendes's Road to Perdition (2002). He was cast atypically as the vicious gang boss Rooney who commits a murder witnessed by the small son of one of his henchmen (Tom Hanks). Set in the 1930s, the movie was heavy on atmosphere and menace, provided by Newman and his contract killer, Jude Law. It brought him yet another Oscar nomination and rave reviews.</p> <p>No roles of similar quality followed, but back on stage he scored a hit in 2002 as the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder's Our Town and reprised it on television the following year, with Woodward as executive producer.</p> <p>His final acting appearance was in the prestige television drama Empire Falls, directed by Fred Schepisi from the award-winning novel by Richard Russo, writer of both Twilight and Nobody's Fool. He was executive producer and won an outstanding actor Emmy.</p> <p>In 2007 he announced, \"I think acting is pretty much a closed book to me.\" Yet his voice could be still be heard on a number of short cartoons, as the character Doc Hudson, both in Cars and Mater and the Ghostlight, and finally the Indy Car Series Preview for 2008, showing that his love of motor racing had never left him. In June 2007, he donated $10m dollars from his charitable foundation to Kenyon College from where he had graduated all those years ago. The endowment created the largest scholarship in the history of the college, but it was just one more act that earned him the justified reputation as one of Hollywood's good guys, as well as one of its greatest actors. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Joanne and their three daughters and two daughters from his first marriage.</p> <p><em>Paul Leonard Newman, actor, born January 26 1925; died September 26 2008</em></p>",
  "<p>In Beirut on September 11, before 22 diplomatic missions, the government of Lebanon and <a href=\"http://www.un.org/unrwa/\">United Nations Relief and Works Agency</a> (UNRWA) launched an appeal for short term relief for some 30, 000 Palestinian refugees displaced by the fighting last year at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/03/syria.lebanon\">Nahr el Bared camp in northern Lebanon</a>. Egypt was the only Arab mission that attended besides the hosts, Lebanon. From UNRWA's Islamic Conference donors, only Iran was present. </p> <p>UNRWA was appealing for nearly US$43m to address the immediate and urgent needs, such as food and shelter, of some of the most disadvantaged people in the Middle East. Not only were their homes destroyed last year, not only did they flee in fear for their lives, not only did they lose almost all of their possessions, but they are also now, in the month of Ramadan, facing the threat of hunger and homelessness. </p> <p>All of UNRWA's funds available at present for Nahr el Bared emergency relief, including a new American commitment of US$4.3m, will be exhausted by the end of October. If no funds are forthcoming in response to the latest appeal, UNRWA will be unable to pay rental subsidies for 3,100 families housed in temporary accommodation. Neither will it be possible to maintain nearly 600 temporary shelters and 11 community buildings. Most worryingly of all, UNRWA will not be able to give food assistance to some 27,000 displaced refugees. What signal does this send to a people dispossessed for more than 60 years? </p> <p>At the appeal launch on September 11, only the United States came forward with new money. More than 90% of the funds pledged so far towards short-term relief for Nahr el Bared have come from Western donors. In addition, of the money pledged for the long-term reconstruction of the camp and surrounding areas, 88% are Western donations. </p> <p>Sadly this is part of a pattern. Luxembourg donates more than any Arab government to UNRWA's regular budget, while Norway gives more to the same budget annually than all Arab governments combined. </p> <p>I hesitate to ask, and I do so only because the refugees are suffering: where are the Arab donors in the face of the alarming reality that will soon be upon us? </p> <p>My question in no way masks heartfelt gratitude towards those in the Arab world who have given to UNRWA so willingly. Organisations, such as the Saudi Committee for the Relief of the Palestinian People, the United Arab Emirates Red Crescent Society, International Islamic Relief Organisation of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Authority for Agricultural Investment and Development, the Qatari Red Crescent Society and Dubai Cares have donated generously to UNRWA, demonstrating that public opinion in the Arab world is far from indifferent to the suffering of Palestinian refugees. The countries that host the refugees \u2013 Jordan, Syria and Lebanon \u2013 and we in the Palestinian Authority, contribute substantially to the welfare of our Palestinian sisters and brothers. And of course many Arab countries generously assist the Palestinian Authority. </p> <p>A year ago the Saudi Arabian government donated to UNRWA $12m for the refugees of Nahr El Bared while the United Arab Emirates donated $5m. Since then, Arab donors (mostly NGOs) contributed $8m, most of which is already spent due to the severity of the emergency. To date, however, Arab governments have not pledged anything to the long-term reconstruction of the camp, the largest single project in UNRWA's history, offering hope for a dignified future to people whose lives have been devastated. </p> <p>Some say that the reconstruction of Nahr El Bared must await clarification of the political situation in Lebanon. This is frankly inhuman. People's basic needs cannot be kept on hold for months or even weeks. </p> <p>The dramatic rise in the price of oil has had a deleterious impact on many. For UNRWA, the resulting rise in food and transport costs has hit hard, threatening the distribution of food to needy households and raising the cost of all UNRWA services. </p> <p>This is yet another reason why I am now compelled, as a Palestine refugee from Lebanon myself, to renew my strong support for the appeal made earlier in September for the displaced refugees of Nahr El Bared. This situation is unprecedented in the recent history of UNRWA. We must do everything possible to avoid the agency being forced by financial necessity to make thousands of Palestine refugees homeless yet again.</p>"
