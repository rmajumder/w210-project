  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>Can cocktails really work with food?</strong></p> <p>It's a tricky one. Not least because of the risks associated with Tom Cruise-style amateur alcohol flinging. Who wants cr\u00e8me de menthe landing in your Yorkshire pud, eh? Still, we who are Nibbles have never shied away from a challenge, so we set off to <a href=\"http://www.theloft-clapham.co.uk\">The Loft</a> in south London, where they've just launched a monthly cocktail dinner menu - \u00a350 a head for four courses and four cocktails. After sinking a beer (to line our stomachs for all the hard liquor to come, strictly medicinal you see), we sat down to await our cocktail fate. </p> <p>Grilled tiger prawns were accompanied by a cocktail of asparagus eau-de-vie, sugar, lemon peel, mint and garden peas, topped with <a href=\"http://www.polroger.co.uk/\">Pol Roger</a> vintage champagne. We examined it suspiciously for a while, and our courage having failed us, we ate a prawn. Then we wagged a mental finger, told ourselves to stop being so unadventurous and took a sip. It wasn't bad, the flavour of the peas was a little too strong, but it went well with the seafood. </p> <p>Next up was roast pork with apple chutney, and a gin-based cocktail with apple juice. Perhaps - unlike the first drink - an obvious combination but again, it complimented the food very well. Could there be something in this food and cocktail combo? Course number three was duck with a potato rosti - and here's where it all got a little too sticky for our palate. The accompanying cocktail of juice, sugar and quince eau-de-vie was one strictly for the very sweet of tooth, while the pudding of warm brownie and ginger cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e with a pear, white cacao and spice cocktail was cream overkill, and we sidled ours over to the assistant editor of 'Class' magazine. </p> <p>Our conclusions? If you're an adventurous drinker, or the tooth fairy, this is the dining experience for you. It's also great value for money. If not, you might prefer to keep your cocktails as a pre or post-dinner tipple. </p> <h2>IN SEASON</h2> <p><strong>Pumpkin</strong></p> <p>Ah, the humble pumpkin in all it's shapes and sizes. It's a wonderful, versatile vegetable, which can be boiled, baked, steamed, roasted or mashed. You can eat the seeds, the flesh and even the flowers of this brightly hued garden character. Nibbles once frequented a health food shop that even used the rind (to be honest, it tasted foul). Sweet or savoury, it goes equally well in a pie - as several million Americans and Canadians will testify every Thanksgiving - as it does in a salad. </p> <p>Not only is the pumpkin nutritionally great, it can also be <a href=\"http://www.yankeehalloween.com/pattern_books/scarysights-det.html\">carved into art </a> (not until October 31 though) or entered into weigh-off competitions. The world record for the largest pumpkin is held by Joe Jutras of Rhode Island. September 2007 who grew a <a href=\"http://www.bigpumpkins.com/viewarticle.asp?id=162&amp;gid=50\">whopping monster weighing in at 1,689 pounds</a>. That's the weight of about ten fully grown people. It has to be moved around with a forklift truck! </p> <p>In fact, the pumpkin is so universally popular that a website called <a href=\" http://www.bigpumpkins.com/\">bigpumpkins.com</a> exists. And if it didn't, we'd probably have to invent it. For those of you feeling inadequate with your normal-sized pumpkins, we suggest following this <a href=\"http://www.deliciousmagazine.co.uk/recipes/Pumpkin_soup_with_Parmesan_1025\">Angela Hartnett recipe</a> for pumpkin and parmesan soup.</p> <h2>CRITIC'S QUOTE</h2> <p><em>England is poised to become the most over-populated country in Europe. It is more crowded than TV studios full of Labour MPs pledging loyalty to Gordon Brown (for now) and more crowded even than Holland, which has long been so groaning with humanity that folk feel obliged to sleep with total strangers.</em></p> <p><em>You are now assailed by a similar enforced intimacy when dining out. Remember the empty acres you used to survey from the table of a decent restaurant? These days, restaurateurs seek a herd of sub-prime starter-diners chomping away from affordable menus at pokey semi-detached tables. If only a restaurant offered a kind of green belt between tables. Oh, for an area of outstanding natural dining.</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2008/08/29/restaurant-review129.xml\">Jasper Gerard visits L'Autre Pied</a>, London, W1</p> <h2>BEST BUY</h2> <p>Searching for gifts for foodie friends and family?

  "<p>The war in Afghanistan spilled over on to Pakistani territory for the first time yesterday when heavily armed commandos, believed to be US Special Forces, landed by helicopter and attacked three houses in a village close to a known Taliban and al-Qaida stronghold.</p> <p>The surprise attack on Jala Khel was launched in early morning darkness and killed between seven and 20 people, according to a range of reports from the remote Angoor Adda region of South Waziristan. The village is situated less than one mile from the Afghan border.</p> <p>Local residents were quoted as saying that most of the dead were civilians and included women and children. It was not known whether any Taliban or al-Qaida militants or western forces were among the dead.</p> <p>Furious official Pakistani condemnation of the attack followed swiftly, amid growing concern that the Nato-led war against the Taliban in Afghanistan could spread to Pakistan, sparking a region-wide conflagration.</p> <p>Owais Ahmed Ghanisaid, the governor of North-West Frontier province, adjoining South Waziristan, said 20 people had died and called for retaliation. \"This is a direct assault on the sovereignty of Pakistan and the people of Pakistan expect that the armed forces ... would rise to defend the sovereignty of the country and give a befitting reply,\" he said.</p> <p>The foreign ministry in Islamabad termed the incursion \"a gross violation of Pakistan's territory\" and a \"grave provocation\" which, it said, had resulted in \"immense\" loss of civilian life.</p> <p>\"Such actions are counterproductive and certainly do not help our joint efforts to fight terrorism. On the contrary, they may fuel the fire of hatred and violence we are trying to extinguish.\"</p> <p>\"This is a very alarming and very dangerous development,\" said a former senior Pakistani official. \"We have absolutely been telling them [the US] not to do this but they ignored us.\"</p> <p>US and Nato commanders say Taliban and al-Qaida fighters use the unruly, semi-autonomous tribal areas of Pakistan to stage attacks on coalition forces inside Afghanistan and create \"safe havens\" where they are immune from attack. Nato and civilian casualties in Afghanistan have reached record levels in the past 12 months in the face of a spreading Taliban offensive.</p> <p>US forces have used missile-carrying drones - unmanned aerial vehicles - to attack militant targets inside Pakistan in the past. But yesterday's assault, involving up to three helicopters and infantry commandos, marked the first time the fight has been taken directly to the enemy on Pakistani soil.</p> <p>Major-General Athar Abbas, a spokesman for the Pakistan army, said Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) had carried out the raid. \"Two helicopters of Isaf landed very early in the morning and conducted a raid on a compound there. As per our report, seven civilians were killed in this raid.\"</p> <p>But a Nato spokesman denied involvement. \"There has been no Nato or Isaf involvement crossing the border into Pakistan,\" a Nato spokesman, James Appathurai, said. There were unconfirmed reports that the incursion was carried out by US Special Forces, which are not under Isaf command and can operate independently. A US military spokesman at the Bagram base near Kabul did not deny an attack had occurred but declined to comment.</p> <p>Tensions between Pakistan's new civilian government and the US have been running high following American accusations that rogue elements in Pakistan's top spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, were feeding classified information on coalition troops to Taliban fighters. Washington has also repeatedly accused Islamabad of failing to do enough to curb militant activity.</p> <p>The strains have been exacerbated by a political crisis in Pakistan following last month's forced resignation of President Pervez Musharraf and the collapse of a power-sharing agreement between the ruling Pakistan People's party (PPP) and Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister. An election to find a replacement for Musharraf is scheduled for Saturday, with the PPP chairman, Asif Ali Zardari, Benazir Bhutto's widower, expected to win.</p> <p>In a further sign of instability, militants opened fire yesterday on prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani's car, in an apparent assassination attempt, near Islamabad. The assailants, firing from a roadside embankment, hit the driver's side window twice. Gilani was not in the car at the time. </p> <p>Today he was due to meet David Cameron, the Conservative leader, who is visiting Pakistan.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/jun/26/afghanistan.pakistan.us.troops\">Watch John D McHugh's video on the struggle for power and influence in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region</a></p>",
  "<p>It was a small notice, in between the ads for childminding and English lessons. \"Free gardening. I will cultivate an abundant vegetable plot for you in your garden and we will share the produce 50/50.\" Then a number. </p> <p>When I got home I looked at my garden - unused, unloved, under wood chip. I looked at Google Earth. Almost half of the 3.1m households in London have a garden. Put together, they would occupy an area roughly the size of the Isle of Wight, and could insulate us against food price hikes and keep us all in fresh vegetables. Most are lawns or crazy paving. </p> <p>The idea of garden-sharing began in cities, among people who wanted to grow fruit and vegetables to eat but didn't have the time, space or confidence. The most obvious solution was to pool resources; for knowledgeable people with time on their hands, but little space, to help the time-poor; and for those - often elderly - with large, unmanageable gardens to get labour in exchange for yield. </p> <p>It started informally with flat dwellers annexing the odd flower bed and gradually it grew. Communal gardens cropped up, gardening groups emerged. Fritz Haeg created an edible estate in the front gardens of a Southwark tower block. Projects such as the Tavistock Garden Share Alliance and pilot schemes such as LandFit and Swapaplot paired up unused gardens with the green-fingered. Suddenly there was a blush of Yahoo message groups, adverts in the local library, communal street sheds and action days. People began to share support and tips at first, then labour, compost, watering duties and harvests. Sales of vegetable seeds overtook those of flowers for the first time since the second world war. </p> <p>The GroFun (Growing Real Organic Food in Urban Neighbourhoods) project in Bristol encourages members to pitch in on each other's gardens and, in exchange, can call an \"action day\" for help in their own garden. Rich Andersen and Valentina Cavallini, self-confessed plant killers, posted an email on the GroFun Yahoo message board for help with their garden. On a sunny Saturday, 10 members set about making raised beds from salvaged bed slats, planting, digging and showing them what to do with their seedlings. They were not experts but they all pitched in and by sunset Anderson and Cavallini had a workable garden with a dozen tomato plants, eight potato and six broccoli seedlings. </p> <p>\"We would never have done it alone. For people like us who haven't done gardening before, there's that barrier of how am I going to start?\" says Anderson. \"Here you have a pool of people who basically break the back of setting up a garden for veggie growing. And then you just have to maintain and care for it.\" The group then becomes a resource, for questions and support. </p> <p>\"Originally, the idea was to have each member producing a single crop that could be swapped systematically,\" explains Nadia Hillman, GroFun founder. But, as she realised, garden-sharing resists administration. It is organic and unorganised (as opposed to disorganised). When harvests happen, members are simply alerted to \"tomato yield\" or \"spinach!\" via a Yahoo post. </p> <p>In London, where locals retain a cautious distrust of their neighbours and face greater space constraints, project Food Up Front concentrates on the front garden. Often overlooked or concreted over, the front garden's orientation can be better than the back: it is highly visible, therefore more sociable, and if you go on holiday you can easily get a neighbour to water the plants without ever having to exchange keys. </p> <p>Residents are assigned a local street rep and given a starter kit, guidance, some high-yield seeds and access to the Project Dirt messageboard, where they can arrange to share watering duties, swap seedlings and plot-hop with members in their area. \"Some 47% of members had never grown food before,\" says co-founder Sebastian Mayfield. \"We encourage them over that initial confidence hump. After that they go off-piste, join up with each other and strike out on their own.\" The movement has 220 members and has engulfed entire streets of south-east London. One neighbour grows potatoes in another's border; and every Monday and Thursday a group of Streatham volunteers work the garden of an arthritis sufferer - growing tomatoes, brassicas, salad greens such as chard and sorrel, potatoes, cabbage and runner beans, and sharing the crops. </p> <p>\"It's very much a community effort,\" says Maya Matthews, a Streatham volunteer. \"You don't know anything when you start out but you're with like-minded people and you all pitch in and work it out together.\" At pub nights, residents discuss peculiarly urban concerns such as how to grow potatoes on concrete (a compost bag, turning up the edges as the shoots grow); why an Ikea container on wheels makes the perfect raised bed (you can wheel it around to chase the sun) and the trials of citrus-growing on a west-facing high-rise.</p> <p>The advantages of garden sharing are evident. It's empowering to reconnect - not just with the soil, but with your community. And to rely on neighbours rather than the hegemony of a supermarket chain that imports 85% of its food (and keeps only three days' worth in store). With household bills rising, fuel prices soaring and washed bags of salad at \u00a31.49, it's a good idea to be able to supplement the supermarket shop locally, and cheaply. \"The benefits are enormous,\" says Hillman. \"You learn skills, enjoy a better quality of life, get outdoors and meet your neighbours. You get to stand in your garden and pick fresh tomatoes rather than sitting in traffic on your way to Sainsbury's. Plus, we will have the edge in an energy-scarce future when everybody else has to learn how to be self-sustaining.\" </p> <p>Community entrepreneurs such as Julie Brown of Growing Communities envisage a future of urban market gardens, a patchwork of micro sites that will supply boroughs with fresh fruit and vegetables for box-schemes from our own backyards. We did it in wartime Britain when concerted communities boosted food production by 91%. We could do it again. We could go out to the garden, brush off the wood chip, and utter that four-letter, most un-British of expletives: \"Help\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Post questions and answers to Ask Leo The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1 3ER <strong>Fax: 020-7713 4366</strong>.

  "<p>Wild cheers often fill the Target Centre in Minneapolis, home to the Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team. Until this week, though, it hadn't usually been because someone had urged the crowd to unite to fight the secret government plan to merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into a single entity, or because they'd mentioned the name of the economist Friedrich Hayek. </p> <p>But these were regular occurrences at the Rally For The Republic, a libertarian counter-convention held just across the river from the official one by the former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. A crowd that organisers estimated at 10,000 screamed and clapped as conservative heroes such as Barry Goldwater and Jesse Ventura took the stage.</p> <p>These were dark times for America - \"the future of the Republic is bleak\", Paul himself warned in a speech during the 10-hour proceedings. But there was solace in coming together to plot the revolution.</p> <p>Exactly what that revolution might entail, though, was unclear. Paul supports what he sees as a strict return to America's constitution, including the abolition of federal income taxes, the Federal Reserve, and most departments of the US government. But his is also an exceptionally broad church. </p> <p>The cable news host Tucker Carlson, who introduced the day's events, remembered first meeting the Texas congressman: \"I didn't agree with his whole outlook,\" he said, \"but he didn't care. He was completely uninterested in having me, or anyone else, sign up to a 30-point programme that was in effect a cult of personality.\"</p> <p>If anything, Paul's is a cult of no personality: the 73-year-old is a diminutive, avuncular presence, courteous without being overly warm, a vessel for his supporters' varying preoccupations. \"People talk about a big tent,\" one supporter said, \"but Ron Paul has taken a razor blade and cut the tent wide open.\"</p> <p>This is one reason why his presidential bid proved a surprise phenomenon, using a well-organised internet campaign to rouse independent-minded voters disaffected with both major parties. But for liberals, discussions with Paul and his supporters are disorienting. They are opposed to the war in Iraq, and to government invasions of privacy, and to the unfettered power of corporations. On the other hand, they oppose gun control, government welfare, abortion, most taxes, and the United Nations - some suspect 9/11 was a US government conspiracy.</p> <p>\"Most of America doesn't really understand the issues the way Ron Paul supporters do, so a lot of them think we're nuts or just extreme,\" said Drew Delavera, a young former Republican from Florida. \"But if they took the time to read the constitution, they'd see we're not so nutty. They'd see we're just going back to the basics.\" </p> <p>To drive home the point, supporters at the rally handed out copies of the Bill of Rights; some wore costumes of the American revolutionary era. (\"No offence,\" said one, Tim Smith, on being questioned in an English accent.)</p> <p>Paul won only a handful of delegates to the official Republican convention, and says the party refused to give him proper access credentials. </p> <p>Not that he seemed to care much: \"I think the two parties have blended together, over many years,\" he told the Guardian. (\"Even Bill Clinton was a more conservative president than George Bush,\" said Howard Phillips, chair of the Conservative Caucus, who spoke at the rally.) </p> <p>Some supporters argued that his defeat in the primaries actually helped. \"If we had sent Ron Paul to Washington, he would still have had to battle the machine of everyone else,\" said Jennifer Riley, from North Dakota. The very-big-tent approach has attracted controversy: Paul was forced to dissociate himself from racist statements contained in newsletters issued under his name, and he refused to return money donated by a supporter with connections to a white supremacist group. </p> <p>\"If somebody sends me money and has a weird belief and I didn't know about it, I don't see that as a big deal,\" he said. \"If they're bad people, why should I give them back their money? I'd rather see us use their money for good things.\"</p> <p>The revolutionaries had descended on Minneapolis from across the country, many travelling in bus charters known as Ronvoys; after the rally they were due to decamp to a Minnesota dairy farm for a six-day festival, Ronstock. Paul seemed quietly thrilled to be the incongruous star of the show. \"The campaign for the presidency is over, but the enthusiasm is not,\" he said. \"It has really only just begun.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Campbell and his family were asleep in their farmhouse in Northern Ireland when the 16-foot blade from the wind turbine crashed through the roof of his home one windy night in January last year. \"It was like a bomb hitting the roof,\" he told the Belfast Telegraph. \"It shattered the tiles and the blade disintegrated itself.\"</p> <p>Campbell was not the only person to see the direct effects of a turbine failure. Just over a year later, in February, a 200ft Vestas wind turbine near the Danish city of \u00c5rhus disintegrated spectacularly in high winds when a blade came loose and smashed into the central tower, causing the whole structure to collapse. The incident was captured on video camera and footage has been viewed thousands of times on <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=c3FZtmlHwcA\">YouTube</a>.</p> <p>Just two days later a turbine close to the town of Sidinge, in Denmark, sent a blade flying more than 300ft before it hit the ground. Keld Boye, a farmer whose land is near the structure, told Danish television: \"I drive my tractor and my wife rides horses out there. Just think if we'd been out there when it happened.\"</p> <p>After Denmark's climate minister demanded an investigation, authorities found the blade loss was caused by a lack of maintenance: regular checks on bolts in the turbine had been neglected. The Danish government announced mandatory service checks for every one of the 5,000 wind turbines in the country.</p> <p><strong>Cracking up</strong></p> <p>Turbines in Britain - there are 2,000, almost all of which are onshore - aren't immune from failure. A 200ft turbine at a wind farm in Kintyre collapsed last November in a 50mph wind. Following that, 26 wind turbines across Scotland were shut down as a precautionary measure while the broken structure was examined. Then the following month in Cumbria, a 100ft steel turbine crashed to the ground.</p> <p>Six months later, in June, as concerns over the incidents last year were receding, a blade cracked away from a 190ft turbine on a Sheffield University research park. Police evacuated the area while engineers allowed the 30ft blade to fall to the ground. The turbine was made by WES, a Dutch company. Earlier that month, the British government had published its renewable energy strategy - with plans to build around 4,000 new onshore wind turbines.</p> <p>The turbines that failed in Cumbria and Scotland were built by Vestas of Denmark, the industry's leading name, which has installed 35,000 turbines globally. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is expected to shortly publish the results of its investigation into the collapses. Vestas said that the collapses were isolated incidents that did not appear to reflect any inherent construction problems.</p> <p>But there is no clear safety standard for the strength of turbines, or their blades. We asked the HSE what legal requirements it has for turbines' strength, or their proximity to homes. It suggested we ask the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ... which said it was probably an HSE issue.</p> <p>So what's the risk of turbine failure? Mike Graham, professor of aerodynamics at Imperial College, says a modern turbine typically spins at 25rpm, which translates to a few million times a year. \"Turbines have to face a lot of force,\" Graham says. \"They are equivalent to the lift forces faced by aircraft in takeoff, and some blades are of comparable size now to the wing of a Boeing 747.\"</p> <p>Unlike aircraft, however, wind turbines operate in \"the lower part of the Earth's atmosphere, where it is very turbulent and wind is more interrupted. Repetitive loading of forces causes cracks. But the industry is well aware of this.\" Engineers calculate the forces and add a safety margin, which is then built into the design.</p> <p>But crucially, manufacturers do not disclose how close to tolerance they make their products, according to Professor Leon Freris, a consultant who is also a member of the board of Ascot Renewco, an insurance company which underwrites policies for turbines. \"The most critical components on a wind turbine in terms of fatigue loading are the blades and the gearbox,\" Freris says. \"The majority of blades at present are made of glass-reinforced plastic.\" They are made to last 20 years, but accelerated fatigue tests, and two years of testing, are standard before new designs are included in products.</p> <p>Errors can be made, though. Earlier this year, Suzlon Energy had to repair or replace almost its entire stock of 1,251 turbine blades, after many developed cracks. The refit is reckoned to have cost the company $25m (\u00a314m).</p> <p>Graham says most wind turbines require gearboxes to enable the slowly turning blades to power fast-running generators: \"It's one of the major problem areas. Gearboxes are big heavy things based at the top of a tower and they are prone to failure. There is a lot of unsteady loading because they operate in wind.\" <br><strong><br>Blown out</strong></p> <p>In Germany - which, with 20,000, has the most wind turbines of any country - Der Spiegel reported last summer on a host of incidents in the previous year. They included one 230ft structure folding in half, two turbines burning down and another two turbines losing blades. Insurers expressed concerns about construction and maintenance, culminating in a report released last year by the German Insurance Association (GIA). It claimed many insufficiently strong turbines were being produced, and that faulty gearboxes and blades were having to be replaced with alarming frequency.</p> <p>The GIA says insurers in the country now see the wind industry as risky: \"Wind turbines are exposed to a high risk - storm, lightning, fire and ice. Also because of the extreme strain on the materials, there are often high damages. The insurance industry demands more time for the development and tests of new constructions, and higher standards for maintenance and repairs.\"</p> <p>Warren Diogo, an underwriter for Ascot Renewco, believes the failed turbine incidents in the UK have been \"insignificant from an insurance perspective due to their remoteness and relatively benign consequences\". But he adds: \"Should these occurrences escalate, causing more severe damage or injury, insurers are likely to more closely scrutinise them.\" Stuart Young, chairman of the Caithness Windfarm Information Forum, which opposes wind farms in north-east Scotland, says: \"They pose unnecessary risks to the public.\" </p> <p>But Charles Anglin of the British Wind Energy Association says: \"In any field of development there are going to be health and safety issues. If there are issues the industry will learn from them. Any piece of equipment can fail. But we have some of the best industry safety records in the world. The UK incidents were due to very particular circumstances. The turbine in Cumbria was 20 years old.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"If the implication is that there has been some reduction in standards because of an increase in numbers, that's wholly unproved and that's not something we would tolerate as an industry. Manufacturers expect extremely high standards of safety. If you look at what happened in Denmark, there was monitoring in the equipment so they were able to clear the area and it was several hours before breakage. There was no danger.\"</p> <p>Vestas, the Danish manufacturer, stresses that its turbines comply with international standards. And standards of construction are not falling, say manufacturers, despite a backlog of orders thought to be worth more than $3bn. Alfons Benzinger of Siemens says: \"We do not see this as being correct and an extremely low number of accidents worldwide support this. Safety has been and will always have the highest priority.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the great UK wind energy gold rush continues. Several schools across the country have submitted plans for smaller urban wind turbines of between 30ft and 80ft tall, following calls in March by Lord Turner, in his role as the government's climate change tsar, for turbines to be built next to motorways and outside every school.</p> <p>Bradford Council in West Yorkshire recently received a planning application for the construction of a 400ft turbine about 300ft from a residential area. Jo Tremere, who lives within a few hundred feet of the proposed site in the suburb of Tong, has campaigned against it. She says: \"We all know that clean energy is needed. But residents around here are really worried. The turbine they are proposing will be bigger than the Statue of Liberty. These things can be dangerous even if they are away from areas of housing. But if a turbine like this collapsed or snapped a blade in a built-up area, then people could die.\"</p>",
  "<p>The media love a good argument, and what better than to pitch polemicists against each other from opposite ends of the spectrum? Thus we are given Bj\u00f6rn Lomborg v Oliver Tickell in a so-called \"climate debate\" (Tickell's apocalyptic view obscures the solutions; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree+environment/climatechange\">Lomborg's stats won't mean much underwater</a>, August 21). Regrettably, we learned from this only that sensible solutions are unlikely to flow from entrenched and extreme positions. Most scientists are amazed and alarmed that the issue of climate change should be treated as an article of faith - something either to be believed or disbelieved - rather than a problem surrounded by a lot of uncertainty. What we got from these two was very misleading.</p> <p>Lomborg claimed: \"A lead economist of the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] did a survey of all the problems and all the benefits accruing from a temperature rise over this century of about approximately 4C. The bottom line is that benefits right now outweigh the costs.\" There have been a few studies of the current effects of climate change (for example, on ice shelf and glacier retreat, and on plants and animals) and the IPCC has concluded these are happening faster than had been expected. But despite what Lomborg says there has been no useful assessment of whether these are beneficial or not, because aggregation of effects involves meaningless trade-offs such as comparing the destruction of Inuit communities with the benefits of ice-freed shipping lanes.</p> <p>Lomborg believes that 4C of global warming \"will not be a challenge to our civilisation\" and derides Tickell, whom he quotes as stating that warming of this amount would bring \"the beginning of the extinction of the human race\". Both of these are heroic conclusions, since there has been no study of the limits to our adaptive capacity. The climate change issue has never been about whether we can survive or not, but keeping damages and costs to a tolerable level. The IPCC concluded in 2007 that we risk billions more people being short of water due to climate change, and hundreds of millions at risk of flooding and hunger. That is a lot of suffering, but not the end of civilisation.</p> <p>There is a strong emerging view, proposed by the IPCC in its latest assessment in 2007, that a careful mixture of mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation will be necessary to meet the challenge of climate change. And this is broadly accepted by governments now striving for agreement by the end of next year. The polarised views of both Tickell and Lomborg miss this completely. We know we cannot avoid some serious climate change (our vacillation over the past 10 years has put paid to that), but we can avoid the worst of it. At a minimum we will have to adapt to about 2C of warming. The choice still available to us is whether we should try to avoid more than this amount of warming. Common sense suggests we should, since we do not really know what impacts the future holds, and we risk repeating the mistake of the movie producer Lew Grade who, looking back on the mounting losses of his film Raise the Titanic, concluded: \"It would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Martin Parry led the 2007 assessment of impacts and adaptation by the IPCC <a href=\"mailto:martin.parry.ipcc@googlemail.com\">martin.parry.ipcc@googlemail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>This week the Royal Society published a special edition of its journal, Philosophical Transactions, dedicated to \"geo-engineering\" interventions to combat global warming. Its initiative deserves to be welcomed, not rejected out of hand. The time may come when we need to geo-engineer in order to maintain our planet in a livable state.</p> <p>Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, made the case against: we should muster serious political will, and equally serious finance, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Using existing and proven clean technologies from wind turbines to concentrated solar power, we need to bring about a worldwide renewable energy revolution. If we do the above, he implied, we will not need any \"outlandish\" or \"outright dangerous\" geo-engineering solutions.</p> <p>He is right in everything he is calling for. In fact, he could have gone further. We need major investments in energy efficiency and conservation, as well as in renewables. We need to bring an end to deforestation and rebuild ravaged forest ecosystems. We also need an agricultural revolution in which farmers draw down excess carbon from the atmosphere into soils, enhancing their ability to retain moisture and nutrients as well as mitigating global warming.</p> <p>But even if we do all the above, can we be sure of preventing climate catastrophe? No. The Earth's climate system is characterised by feedback loops which can amplify even a small initial perturbation. And it seems that following an initial post-industrial warming of 0.8C, one major positive feedback process is already well under way, in the Arctic. </p> <p>Last year saw a record melting of Arctic sea ice. This year, that record has been broken: for the first time in history, the northern ice cap can be circumnavigated. And with melting ice, more sunshine is absorbed rather than reflected back into space. The result is more warming, and more melting. In turn this increases the degassing of methane from Arctic bogs, lakes and thawing permafrost - and methane is a powerful greenhouse gas in its own right, 70 times stronger than CO2 over 20 years.</p> <p>If we rapidly cut our emissions of greenhouse gases, it might bring an end to the \"Arctic amplifier\". Or it might not. It is entirely possible that the melting of the sea ice and the emissions of Arctic methane have already reached a point of no return that will lead to a warming world no matter what we do. It would be imprudent not to insure ourselves against this possibility. </p> <p>This means setting up a global research programme into geo-engineering options. The most valuable options are those that will have immediate effect by directly altering the Earth's thermal balance. Two proposals stand out. First, the introduction of sulphate aerosol to the stratosphere to reflect sunlight. There are fears that this could damage the ozone layer, but then we know that volcanoes routinely discharge millions of tonnes of sulphate into the stratosphere, cooling the Earth without inflicting long-term harm.</p> <p>James Lovelock, who developed the Gaia hypothesis, warns of global acidification as the stratospheric sulphate mist slowly falls to the ground. However this problem is easily solved. We already emit 50m tonnes of sulphur a year, mainly as sulphate from power stations and shipping. This is 10 times more than would be used for geo-engineering purposes, and that could be more than offset by additional cuts in emissions.</p> <p>Better still is the proposal by physicist John Latham and colleagues to raise the reflectivity of marine clouds. This would involve a fleet of wind-powered yachts criss-crossing the world's oceans, controlled by a global network of satellites, blowing out a mist of ultra-fine salty droplets to act as cloud condensation nuclei. Latham's solution promises to be inexpensive, highly effective, environmentally benign, and reversible in a matter of days as the droplets are washed from the sky in rain.</p> <p>One major question is that of who should be responsible for any interventions. The best-placed body is the UN climate convention (UNFCCC), whose major achievement to date is the Kyoto protocol. Its main objective, to \"prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\", by stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations, should be extended to accommodate the possibility of geo-engineering. </p> <p>This would also provide clarity as to the purpose of geo-engineering. Doug Parr decries it as an \"expression of political despair\" that would only produce business-as-usual emissions. Lovelock sees it as a temporary palliative before inevitable disaster strikes. We must make sure they are both wrong. Geo-engineering should be developed strictly as a firefighting capability to maintain long-term climatic stability, not as a substitute for all the other actions we should be taking. </p> <p>If the topic enters into discussions at the UNFCCC meeting in Poznan this December, member states must ensure that the two approaches are firmly linked so that no geo-engineering is permitted unless accompanied by deep and rapid cuts in emissions. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Oliver Tickell is author of Kyoto2 <br><a href=\"http://www.kyoto2.org\">kyoto2.org</a></p>",

Until this week, though, it hadn't usually been because someone had urged the crowd to unite to fight the secret government plan to merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into a single entity, or because they'd mentioned the name of the economist Friedrich Hayek.</p> <p>But these were regular occurrences at the Rally For The Republic, a libertarian counter-convention held just across the river from the official one by the former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. A crowd that organisers estimated at 10,000 clapped and screamed as conservative heroes such as Barry Goldwater and Jesse Ventura took the stage. These were dark times for America - \"the future of the Republic is bleak,\" Paul himself warned in a speech during the 10-hour proceedings. But there was solace in coming together to plot the revolution.</p> <p>Exactly what that revolution might entail, though, was unclear. Paul supports what he sees as a strict return to America's constitution, including the abolition of federal income taxes, the Federal Reserve, and most departments of the US government. But his is also an exceptionally broad church. The cable news host Tucker Carlson, who introduced the day's events, remembered first meeting the Texan congressman: \"I didn't agree with his whole outlook,\" he said, \"but he didn't care. He was completely uninterested in having me, or anyone else, sign up to a 30-point programme that was in effect a cult of personality.\" </p> <p>If anything, Paul's is a cult of no personality: the 73-year-old is a diminutive, avuncular presence, courteous without being overly warm, a vessel for his supporters' widely varying preoccupations. \"People talk about a big tent,\" one supporter said, \"but Ron Paul has taken a razor blade and cut the tent wide open.\"</p> <p>This is one reason why his presidential bid proved a surprise phenomenon, using a well-organised internet campaign to rouse independent-minded voters disaffected with both major parties. But for liberals, discussions with Paul and his supporters are disorienting.</p> <p>They are opposed to the war in Iraq, and to government invasions of privacy, and to the unfettered power of corporations. On the other hand, they oppose gun control, government welfare, abortion, most taxes, and the United Nations; some suspect 9/11 was a US government conspiracy. </p> <p>\"Most of America doesn't really understand the issues the way Ron Paul supporters do, so a lot of them think we're nuts, or just extreme,\" said Drew Delavera, a young former Republican from Florida. \"But if they took the time to read the constitution, they'd see we're not so nutty. They'd see we're just going back to the basics.\" To drive home the point, supporters at the rally handed out copies of the Bill of Rights; some wore costumes of the American revolutionary era. </p> <p>Paul won only a handful of delegates to the official Republican convention, and says the party refused to give him proper access credentials. Not that he seemed to care much: \"I think the two parties have blended together, over many years,\" he told the Guardian. </p> <p>Some supporters argued that his defeat in the primaries actually helped. \"If we had sent Ron Paul to Washington, he would still have had to battle the machine of everyone else,\" said Jennifer Riley, from North Dakota.</p> <p>The very-big-tent approach has attracted controversy: Paul was forced to dissociate himself from racist statements contained in newsletters issued under his name, and he refused to return money donated by a supporter with connections to a white supremacist group. \"If somebody sends me money and has a weird belief and I didn't know about it, I don't see that as a big deal,\" he said. \"If they're bad people, why should I give them back their money? I'd rather see us use their money for good things.\"</p> <p>The revolutionaries had descended on Minneapolis from across the country, many travelling in bus charters known as Ronvoys; after the rally they were due to decamp to a Minnesota dairy farm for a six-day festival, Ronstock. Paul seemed quietly thrilled to be the incongruous star of the show. \"The campaign for the presidency is over, but the enthusiasm is not,\" he said. \"It has really only just begun.\"</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire tycoon and former Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, the man who appeared to believe that he could buy anyone and anything \u2013 including a British premier league football team and Thai justice, is now a fugitive in the UK. He is a wanted man, facing two cases of corruption before the Thai courts, and probable extradition proceedings.</p> <p>But the anti-Thaksin movement in Thailand not only wants to prosecute the former prime minister for fraud and corruption, but is also intent on bringing down the current government in Bangkok, widely viewed as a \"proxy\" regime, composed mostly of the former prime minister's acolytes and supporters.</p> <p>Several days ago, the tenacious anti-Thaksin protest movement the PAD (People's Alliance for Democracy), seized the prime minister's office, <a href=\"http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1428201.php/Thai_army_steps_in_to_restore_order_after_protest_turns_violent_\">Government House</a>, in Bangkok. </p> <p>Airports have also <a href=\"http://www.business24-7.ae/articles/2008/8/pages/touristsstrandedinphuketasthaiprotestsblockadeairport.aspx\">been disrupted</a>, hitting Thailand's tourist industry by leaving thousands of holidaymakers stranded. A frustrated prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, declared a <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24284589-663,00.html\">state of emergency</a> from September 1, empowering the military to dislodge PAD protestors. The latest news is that the government has sought court orders to shut down around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/03/digitalmedia.thailand\">400 websites</a>.</p> <p>Thaksin, who dominated Thailand's politics as elected prime minister for a record five years, is now a wanted man in Bangkok. Ousted by a peaceful military coup in 2006, Thaksin opted for temporary exile in London and bought Manchester City FC. Meanwhile the deposed PM had been under investigation for fraud, corruption and tax evasion, in relation to his actions during his term of office, from 2001-6. By 2007 he had been charged with abusing his position as PM to benefit his business interests, and strengthen his near-monopoly over Thailand's telecommunications industry. </p> <p>After his wife was recently found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, Thaksin sensed that the Thai courts, which in the past had never dared to jail the rich and powerful, might be on the brink of establishing a new precedent. Thaksin had always denied all charges of wrongdoing, but he failed to turn up for his next court appearance and fled back to the UK, issuing a statement that the courts were biased against his family.</p> <p>This has prompted the sensational sale of Manchester City to <a href=\"http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/abu-dhabi-united-group-takes-over-man-city_10092161.html\">Abu Dhabi United Group</a>. It was a shrewd move, with the Football Association about to turn up the heat on whether Thaksin's role at the club fell foul of the requirements that owners and major shareholders should be deemed to be \"fit and proper persons\".</p> <p>Now Thaksin has taken a back seat, becoming honorary director, while still retaining a 30% stake in the club. At the same time he has clearly pulled off a financial coup. Given that \u00a31.2bn of his many assets had been frozen by the Thai courts in 2007, he has probably turned in a handsome profit on the sale. </p> <p>But the Thaksin legend is not just about buying football teams, TV stations and votes from poor farmers at election time. Earlier this year, several lawyers acting for Thaksin were convicted of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7473641.stm\">trying to buy justice</a> when a cake box was discovered in the precincts of Thailand's supreme court. Inside the box, instead of a cake, were bundles of cash, worth around $60,000 (\u00a330,500).</p> <p>If the court in Bangkok convicts Thaksin of corruption in a land deal on September 17, then the attorney general in Thailand will be obliged to proceed with an extradition request. Lawyers for the deposed premier have been preparing papers for that eventuality and filing a request for political asylum.</p> <p>Before anyone begins to feel sorry for him, let us remember that any claim to be a political refugee, hounded by enemies, fails to take into account not only the unscrupulous pursuit of his business greed, but also the thousands of drug suspects affected by his infamous 2003 \"war on drugs\" \u2013 a lethal clean up campaign. At the height of his power, he incited police chiefs and governors to demonstrate rapid success rates, rather than respecting <a href=\"www.hrw.org/reports/2004/thailand0704/4.htm\">human rights</a> and the law.</p> <p>Thaksin still exercises massive influence on the current Thai government, and plots his comeback. The Thaksin legacy has polarised the nation, with most of Bangkok and the middle class wanting to see him behind bars, while the poor majority of the nation see him as the only prime minister who delivered cheap public healthcare and low-interest loans for farmers. </p> <p>In spite of a state of emergency, neither police nor military want to attack the well-connected PAD leaders and so the PM's office is still in the hands of the anti-government protestors. Thailand's coup-prone military is split between the government side, and those top generals who favour the opposition, thus neutralising each other. Some of King Bhumipol's privy councillors are also deeply opposed to Thaksin's influence on the country. </p> <p>The nation's development has been paralysed, caught between the pro-Thaksin rightwing government and the equally conservative PAD, which has metamorphosed from a populist peoples' power movement into an fanatically royalist\u2013led ideology based on the Thai trinity of nation, religion and monarchy.</p> <p>Some PAD leaders even advocate a reduction of democracy, by limiting parliament to only 30% elected by popular vote and rest appointees. Such reactionary nonsense only plays into the scheming hands of Thaksin and further cements his bonds with the common Tao \u2013 the masses.</p> <p>Until this ugly gap between the impoverished countryside and its legions of poor farmers and the huge city of Bangkok's elitist-minded urbanites is bridged, and unified, by one political movement or party, Thailand's deadlock is likely to defy all attempts to break the impasse, and Thaksin's legacy will continue haunt the nation.</p>",
  "<p>The war in Afghanistan spilled over into Pakistani territory for the first time today when heavily armed commandoes, believed to be US special forces, landed by helicopter and attacked three houses in a village close to a known Taliban and al-Qaida stronghold.</p> <p>The early morning attack on Jala Khel killed between seven and 20 people, according to a range of reports from the remote Angoor Adda region of South Waziristan. The village is situated less than a mile from the Afghanistan border.</p> <p>Local residents were quoted as saying most of the dead were civilians and included women and children. It was not known whether any Taliban or al-Qaida militants or western forces were among the dead.</p> <p>Major-General Athar Abbas, a spokesman for the Pakistan army, said Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) had carried out the raid. \"Two helicopters of Isaf landed very early in the morning and conducted a raid on a compound there. As per our report, seven civilians were killed in this raid.\"</p> <p>But a Nato spokesman denied involvement. \"There has been no Nato or Isaf involvement crossing the border into Pakistan,\" the Nato spokesman James Appathurai said.</p> <p>There were unconfirmed reports that the incursion was carried out by US special forces, which are not under Isaf command and can operate independently. A US military spokesman at the Bagram base near Kabul did not deny an attack had occurred but declined to comment.</p> <p>Official Pakistani condemnation swiftly followed the attack amid growing concern that the Nato-led war against the Taliban in Afghanistan could spread to Pakistan, sparking a region-wide conflagration.</p> <p>Owais Ahmed Ghanisaid, the governor of North-West Frontier province, which adjoins South Waziristan, said 20 people had died and called for retaliation by the Pakistani army. \"This is a direct assault on the sovereignty of Pakistan, and the people of Pakistan expect that the armed forces ... would rise to defend the sovereignty of the country and give a befitting reply,\" he said.</p> <p>The foreign ministry in Islamabad said the incursion was \"a gross violation of Pakistan's territory\" and a \"grave provocation\" that had resulted in \"immense\" loss of civilian life.</p> <p>\"Such actions are counter-productive and certainly do not help our joint efforts to fight terrorism. On the contrary, they undermine the very basis of cooperation and may fuel the fire of hatred and violence we are trying to extinguish.\"</p> <p>\"This is a very alarming and very dangerous development,\" said a former senior Pakistani official. \"We have absolutely been telling them (the US) not to do this but they ignored us.\"</p> <p>US and Nato commanders say Taliban and al-Qaida fighters use the unruly, semi-autonomous tribal areas of Pakistan to stage strikes on coalition forces inside Afghanistan and to create \"safe havens\" where they are immune from attack. Nato and civilian casualties in Afghanistan have reached record levels in the past 12 months as the result of a spreading Taliban offensive.</p> <p>US forces have used missile-carrying drones \u2013 unmanned aerial vehicles \u2013 to target militant targets inside Pakistan in the past. But today's assault, involving up to three helicopters and infantry commandoes, marked the first time a direct attack had taken place on Pakistani soil.</p> <p>Tensions between Pakistan's new civilian government and the US have been running high after American accusations that rogue elements in Pakistan's top spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence Agency, were feeding classified information on coalition troops to Taliban fighters. Washington has also repeatedly accused Islamabad of failing to do enough to curb militant activity along the Afghan border.</p> <p>The strains have been exacerbated by a political crisis in Pakistan after last month's forced resignation of President Pervez Musharraf and the collapse of a power-sharing agreement between the ruling Pakistan People's party (PPP) and Nawz Sharif, a former prime minister. An election to find a replacement for Musharraf is scheduled for Saturday, with the PPP chairman and Benazir Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, expected to win.</p> <p>In a further sign of instability, militants opened fire today on prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani's car, in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/03/pakistan.gilani.assassination\">apparent assassination attempt</a>, near Islamabad. The assailants, firing from a roadside embankment, hit the driver's side window twice. Gilani was not in the car at the time. Television pictures showed two clear impact marks on the car's bullet-proof window, which cracked along its length but did not shatter. Gilani's son and a government minister were reportedly in the motorcade.</p> <p>A top security official in Islamabad said: \"This was a warning. They're saying, 'We can get you'. If they could fire bullets, they could also fire a rocket-launcher.\" The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was a protest against military operations against them in the north-west valley of Swat.</p> <p>Gilani was due to meet David Cameron, the Conservative leader who is visiting Pakistan. In a speech, Cameron said the attack was \"another reminder of the permanent threat that terrorism poses\".</p>",
  "<p>Even before the Olympics, China struck fear across the world. To westerners, China steals our shirts and jobs, pirates our technologies and pollutes \"our\" atmosphere. Developing countries are no stranger to such concern - particularly Mexico. </p> <p>A quarter-century ago, China and Mexico were large, one-party, protectionist developing countries. Both chose to reform their economies by globalising them. Mexico's globalisation strategy came straight out of the Washington consensus handbook - they rapidly slashed tariffs and deregulated the state hoping to lure trade and investment. China took a more gradual, government-managed approach to globalisation. Mexico is losing.</p> <p>After signing the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement\">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (Nafta) in 1994 and gaining unrivalled access to the US, things initially looked good for Mexico. Then, in 2001 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1548866.stm\">China entered the World Trade Organisation</a> (WTO). Five years later, China became the United States' second largest trading partner, supplying 17% of all US imports. Mexico came in third with a share of less than 10%.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/DEVEME.html\">2005 Inter-American Development Bank/Harvard University study</a> found that of all Latin American countries, Mexico had the potential to be most hurt by China because Mexico's \"export basket\" (the profile of the types of products it exports) was most similar to China's. In <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=PublicationURL&amp;_tockey=%23TOC%235946%232008%23999639991%23694300%23FLA%23&amp;_cdi=5946&amp;_pubType=J&amp;_auth=y&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=0b65ff37db918affb7df55681098265b\">a paper published in last month's World Development</a> with colleagues from the UN and Tufts University, I found that indeed Mexico was losing ground. We show that over half of all Mexican exports to the US are under \"threat\" from China. Export for export, Mexico is rapidly losing ground in the US market, and China is gaining. This is a looming crisis for Mexico, where 85% of all exports go to the US. </p> <p>Why is China surging so far ahead of Mexico in the US market? After all, it takes 18 days to ship goods from China to the US but no more than 18 hours for most of Mexico. What's more, with Nafta Mexico faces virtually no tariffs for exporting to the US, whereas China's tariffs are close to 6%.</p> <p>The answer: Mexico's approach to globalisation is hands-off, whereas China's is hands-on. Sticking to the orthodoxy of the Washington Consensus, Mexico's relatively high interest rates have led to a persistently overvalued currency. Heterodox China consciously undervalues its currency to subsidise the development of export markets. From 1986 to 2006 the exchange rate of the Mexican peso to the US dollar has appreciated 21%. The yuan depreciated by almost 80% during the same period. </p> <p>The dismantling of Mexican industrial policy is also to blame. Mexico hoped that Nafta would attract foreign firms and trade that would create linkages with the broader Mexican economy and spur growth. They <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/08/usforeignpolicy.colombia\">learned the hard way</a> that such linkages don't happen without parallel public policy. Foreign investment became an enclave by importing 95% of their inputs (many from China!) rather than working with Mexican firms.</p> <p>Alongside the foreign firms that have flocked to China, the government selectively targets key national firms with infrastructure, credit and research and development. This makes Chinese firms attractive partners to global ones and sets the stage for broad-based growth. China had the smarts and space to conduct such policies under WTO and fights hard to keep that space in global trade negotiation. Unfortunately for Mexico, there is a straightjacket wrapped around industrial policy under Nafta.</p> <p>Throw in China's lower wages and Chinese exports become an offer US consumers just can't refuse.</p> <p>Today's high prices (propped up in part from Chinese demand) for Mexican crude oil distract Mexico from the China threat. Yet <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/06/30/MNGAAJN9JG1.DTL\">Mexico's proven reserves may dry up in 10 years</a>. Thus the country will soon have to turn to manufacturing exports as an engine of growth. By that time, China may have taken away the ladder to economic development that Mexico seeks to climb.</p>",

While college still retains the aura of youthful indulgence and excess, toga parties have gone out of style, and student alcohol abuse is a problem that schools are taking ever more seriously. The issue has gained renewed prominence in recent weeks, as more than 100 college and university presidents have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/alcohol.education\">called for a debate about reducing the legal drinking age</a> in the US as a way of curbing binge drinking.</p> <p>In 1984, following a successful campaign by the organisation <a href=\"http://www.madd.org/\">Mothers Against Drunk Driving</a> (Madd), the legal drinking age in the US was raised from 18 to 21. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act\">National Minimum Drinking Age Act</a> accomplished this change indirectly by restricting highway funds to states that did not enforce the higher drinking age. According to Madd, the law has been effective: alcohol-related traffic deaths among 16- to 20-year-olds decreased 60% between 1982 and 2006.</p> <p>Underage drinking is not exclusively a college problem, but colleges receive young people liberated from the restraining influences of their families and communities three years before drinking becomes legal. Rather unsurprisingly, binge drinking is more prevalent at so-called \"party schools\", where alcohol is allowed to flow freely, according to <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/jsad/article/What_We_Have_Learned_From_the_Harvard_School_of_Public_Health_College_Alcoh/2252.html\">a recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health</a>.</p> <p>And, as the saying goes, it's all fun and games until someone gets hurt. Some <a href=\"http://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/media/Journal/136-Hingson.sep.pdf\">1,700 college students die each year</a> in alcohol-related accidents. A 2006 study of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-08-29-campus-fires-cover_x.htm\">deadly fires on college campuses</a> by USA Today found that alcohol was a factor in 59% of them.</p> <p>Many schools have responded by taking a harsher attitude toward student drinking. Shortly after being named <a href=\"http://www.alligator.org/articles/2008/07/29/news/campus/080729_party.txt\">the nation's top party school</a> by the Princeton Review, the University of Florida <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/blogs/paper-trail/2008/8/8/florida-proposal-would-ban-drinking-games.html\">introduced a revised student code of conduct</a> that would ban \"any extreme alcohol consumption activity that constitutes, facilitates or encourages competitive, rapid or excessive consumption of alcohol\" - including such party favourites as keg stands and ice luges.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1828085,00.html\">Beer pong</a>, a popular drinking game in which players attempt to toss ping-pong balls into cups of beer, has been banned at Georgetown, Yale, Tufts, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and other schools. Last fall, even Dartmouth, the game's birthplace, where the party culture dies hard, outlawed water pong, a non-alcoholic version.</p> <p>It's easy to scoff at schools for being overly paternalistic, but they have more at stake than embarrassed dignity or even student safety. Thoughts of potential liability are ever-present in a litigious time. After his son died in 2006 in an alcohol-related fire at the University of Dayton, Kim Cohen sued the school. \"We passed the baton to the University of Dayton. They dropped it, and now we have to carry that loss,\" he told USA Today. \"There comes an assumption of safety. Their inaction cost my son's life.\" The parents of a Rider University student who died last year after a <a href=\" http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/23Rrider.html\">suspected fraternity hazing incident</a> also filed suit, prompting administrators to tighten the school's alcohol policy.</p> <p>The risks are not limited to alcohol abuse, either. The shootings at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University vividly demonstrate what can happen when schools fail to provide the supervision and counselling that troubled students require. The families of those killed at Virginia Tech <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2008/04/11/va_tech_families_agree_to_deal/\">received $11m in compensation</a>, and the parents of MIT student Elizabeth Shin <a href=\"http://www-tech.mit.edu/V121/N70/70shin-article.70n.html\">filed a $27.6m suit</a> against the school, following their daughter's apparent suicide in 2000. Though that case was later <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/04/parents_strike_settlement_with_mit_in_death_of_daughter/\">settled out of court</a>, it put many colleges on high alert.</p> <p>With such large interests of their own to protect, schools' commitment to protecting students may be met with scepticism. Even as colleges introduce new measures to identify students with mental health problems, students who express thoughts of suicide are more likely to be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/education/03suicide.html\">forced to take leaves of absence</a> than to be offered help. In one prominent case, after George Washington University sophomore <a href=\"http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=30692\">Jordan Nott checked himself into the campus hospital</a> in the fall of 2004 for depression that led him to contemplate suicide, he was charged with \"endangering behaviour\" - a violation of the student code of conduct - and received a blunt letter from the dean of students: \"You are hereby suspended from the George Washington University effective immediately.\"</p> <p>Colleges insist that such moves are intended to provide students with the care they need, while protecting the rest of the school community. Whether or not their motives are altruistic, however, the advantages for institutional security are undeniable. As Cornell's deputy counsel Nelson Roth <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1194020,00.html\">told Time magazine recently</a>: \"Once the student is gone or goes home, the individual becomes the responsibility of parents. Our obligation ends.\"</p> <p>The call from college presidents to consider a lower drinking age seems at odds with their efforts to restrict alcohol consumption. But are they opposed to drinking per se or just the manner and place in which it occurs? Instead of having 18-year-old freshmen drink clandestinely in dorms and frat houses, perhaps the schools simply prefer that they drink off campus in bars and nightclubs, where the responsibility for monitoring consumption and the onus of liability will fall on others.</p> <p>Each side of the drinking-age debate has evidence to support its position, but the real issue isn't which set of fatality statistics is more credible and compelling. The central question is how and at what age young people acquire habits of responsible drinking. Should it remain a college rite of passage, or should it begin earlier, under the supervision of parents and other adults? That's certainly a debate worth having.</p>",
  "<p>In 1997 the brilliant sports writer Pete Davies published a book about women's football \u2013 soccer, if you're on the continent to my left \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/03/womensfootball\">about one team in particular</a>. I Lost My Heart To The Doncaster Belles is an account of the struggles and triumphs of a good northern team playing in a minority league. I mention this because at exactly this time I was surrendering my own cherry just 15 miles over the road. And while Mr Davies lost his heart to the Belles, me, I got pucked by the Sheffield Steelers.</p> <p>The South Yorkshire club were the first hockey club I ever followed. Before them, I knew nothing about the sport. The crowd in the Sheffield Arena, the team's home barn, would chant \"Powerplay!\" and I'd have not a clue what this meant. I called the face-off \"kick-off\" and shouted \"good ball!\" at any tape-to-tape pass that didn't pass me by. Even so, ice hockey in the 'House of Steel' was great. Not only that, but it was cheap, and friendly too: eight quid for entry to one of the few places in the city where a 20-something male wasn't likely to get his head kicked in.</p> <p>This Saturday the Steelers will embark on their 17th season, hosting the Edinburgh Capitals at the Sheffield Arena. The two clubs are part of the EIHL (Elite Ice Hockey League, Elite League for anyone not wanting to sound drunk) and are joined by teams in Basingstoke, Belfast, Cardiff, Coventry, Hull, Manchester, Newcastle and Nottingham. With player salaries ranging from \u00a316,000 to \u00a332,000 the league is fully professional; the clubs provide accommodation for their skaters and the skaters help spread the message in the wider communities. Families are encouraged to attend, with packages for two adults and two kids priced at around \u00a340 a game. Needless to say, the Manchester Phoenix are more accessible and more affordable than Manchester United.</p> <p>The standard of hockey played in the Elite League is decent, falling somewhere between that of North America's AHL and ECHL minor leagues. Because of this, attendance numbers are healthy, even robust. The Sheffield Steelers and Nottingham Panthers draw about 5,000 fans per game \u2013 7,000 when they play each other \u2013 as do Belfast; Newcastle, Manchester and Edinburgh pull a couple of thousand each night, close to the capacity of their respective home venues.</p> <p>I do remember that about a decade ago a writer for the football magazine When Saturday Comes described British ice hockey as being a 'Big Mac sport'. The fact that I've remembered this phrase for so long means that it might have some currency. Then again, I am out of practice with regard to the UK game. Researching this piece I was surprised to learn that the Elite League restricts each team to 10 overseas players, thus forging a link between the sport at club and national level. One of the reasons given for establishing football's Premier League was that it would strengthen the England team. Fans of British ice hockey might have to contend with phrases such as 'Big Mac sport', but they've never been lied to quite like that.</p> <p>The reason I'm out of practice with the UK game, by the way, is that I live in London and these days don't very often travel to South Yorkshire. Like all minority sports (and it is a minority sport \u2013 there are more hockey rinks in Toronto alone than in the whole of the UK) the EIHL struggles for national coverage, especially in print. This struggle isn't helped by the fact that the league has no London team.</p> <p>London essentially has two kinds of journalist \u2013 the one who believes the city is the centre of the world, and the one who believes the city <em>is</em> the world. Given this, securing national coverage for a game between the Basingstoke Bison and the Hull Stingrays is a tough draw. Securing a team in London would be a smart move for the Elite League. Not because London is the UK's key 'media market' (although it is) and not because London is the UK's most significant city (although it is). The reason London should have a team is because it might just take hold.</p> <p>A mile or so up the street from me is the Emirates Stadium, home of Arsenal Football Club. Should you find a four-leaf clover growing atop a pile of rocking horse dung and are thus able to buy a ticket, prices start at \u00a348 for Category A games and \u00a333 for Category B. The average age of Premier League attendees is now 40-something, meaning that a whole generation of people are being priced out of the stadiums near which they live. Most of these people will not develop a taste for hockey. But you don't need most of them, just four or five thousand. Build a small arena in '0207' London \u2013 different from the now-defunct London Knights, who were foreign-owned and played out in the Docklands \u2013 and sell the game, cheap, to young people. It might work. It did for me.</p> <p>Just as it did, and is, in cities such as Coventry and Belfast. In the years since I sat confused in the 'House of Steel' I've been fortunate enough to attend enough NHL games that I've now lost count of their number. I've been fortunate enough to find myself in the dressing room of the Philadelphia Flyers, the Washington Capitals and the New York Rangers. I've seen Sidney Crosby score, seen Sean Avery 'monkey dance' in front of Martin Brodeur. I've even watched in amazement as this fruitless obsession of mine actually began to bear fruit, here on theguardian.com.</p> <p>And I owe it all to the Sheffield Steelers, to British ice hockey. For the first time this century, last year I found myself back at the Sheffield Arena. Unfortunately it wasn't to hear the sound of puck on Plexiglas, but rather to interview a band. As I walked the corridors at ice level, I opened the door to the hockey team's empty dressing room. It didn't really matter that the Steelers weren't there. For me, it seemed as if I'd come home.</p> <p>So let me ask this favour: if you get the chance to attend one of this season's Elite League games then please do so. It's not much more expensive than the pictures and you might come home with a souvenir puck, or someone's front tooth. Not only that, but you will be supporting something that is local to you in more ways than geography. Try it once, you never know. I'm not going to say that the experience will change your life, but it certainly changed mine.</p> <h2>Postscript</h2> <p>I am indebted to the Elite League's media liaison Ooficer Andy Costigan and Sheffield Steelers PR hockeypedia David Simms for their help with this column. In terms of predictions, both men tell me that the Steelers, Coventry Blaze and Belfast Giants will be strong this term, and that's good enough for me. Regular readers of this column last season will be, er, delighted to know that today's post is the first of this season's fortnightly dispatches. Same place, two weeks' time, then?</p>",

  "<p>On the walls outside the home of Hussam Khader, in the narrow streets of the Balata refugee camp, posters, graffiti and flags celebrate his release a week ago from an Israeli jail. Alongside them is a newly-painted sign in large Arabic lettering which reads: \"Occupation and corruption are two faces of one coin.\"</p> <p>Last Monday, Khader, 47, was one of 198 security prisoners released by the Israeli authorities as a gesture towards the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. It was the third prisoner release since the latest and still fruitless peace negotiations began a year ago. </p> <p>Apart from two long-serving prisoners, most of those freed last week were young men jailed for attacks on the Israeli military or settlers and who were close to finishing their sentences. But the release of Khader was unexpected. He was a prominent youth leader in the Fatah movement, which is led by Abbas, and a former Palestinian legislator who became an outspoken critic of the late Yasser Arafat and the corruption that surrounded him at the top of the Fatah movement and the Palestinian leadership.</p> <p>Khader is one of several men in a younger generation of Fatah leaders who command support on the streets and who are pushing for major reform within the movement. He still rails against Fatah corruption, though it remains to be seen whether in the months ahead he can bring any significant change to a situation in stalemate. Since his release, thousands of supporters have descended on his small home in the Balata camp, in Nablus, to talk about the future at a time of deep division between the two leading Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas, and deadlock in the peace negotiations.</p> <p>\"The situation has got worse because of the separation and fighting between Fatah and Hamas,\" Khader said. \"We don't have a state yet, but we have two heads in this state and this will push us back to square one in our struggle. It's a very, very dangerous point that we have reached.\"</p> <p>Khader was arrested at his home in March 2003 and convicted of being a member of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the armed wing of the Fatah movement that played a key role in the second intifada, and of helping fund the group through connections to Hizbullah and Iran. He was sentenced to seven years in jail but released after five and a half. It was his 24th time in an Israeli prison - he was first arrested at age 13 for taking part in a demonstration against the Israeli occupation.</p> <p>While he was inside, Fatah lost its dominance to its Islamist rival Hamas, which won elections in 2006 and then took full control of Gaza last year after a near civil war between the two factions. Both sides seem a very long way from returning to an agreement to govern together.</p> <p>\"Hamas missed a historic opportunity to lead the Palestinian people,\" he said. \"They fell into a trap and acted in a cruel and bad way towards the Palestinian people to defend their project.\" Yet, in the past week several senior Hamas leaders, including the deposed prime minister Ismail Haniyeh, have telephoned Khader to celebrate his release. At the same time, he said, problems within Fatah had worsened. \"The corruption is more organised now,\" he said. \"We repeat our mistakes. We never criticise our own experience.\"</p> <p>Others regarded as the young guard in Fatah make a similar argument, the most prominent among them Marwan Barghouti, a leader of the Fatah armed wing who was jailed a year before Khader and who remains in prison. Khader, who said he spent time in talks with Barghouti when they were in the same jails, argues for a new unity government with Hamas and rebuilding of his Fatah movement and says the Palestinians should work towards a two-state peace agreement with the Israelis. \"We can change our situation. We can choose our destiny by ourselves and our failed leaders are not our destiny,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>You've heard the expression 'cool as a cucumber'? Even rusty academics have cemented it into British language \u2013 in dictionaries no less. The definition should say: 'Women who can wear Halston's over-the-knee Misa boots without resembling Julia Roberts circa Pretty Woman. Women with je ne sais quoi \u00e0 la pregnant Cate Blanchett and post-divorce Michelle Williams and, erm\u2026 Daisy Lowe.' </p> <p>Then there are the rest of us. Those with less cool than a tomato. Even on a 'fabulous' day. </p> <p>Somehow, I volunteered to sit beside a letterbox for 12 hours. The article would be called a day in the life of a post box, and I suppose the ridiculousness, and the delusion began there. So Big Boss sent me to the little red box in rural Somerset, driving (or should I say kangaroo-hopping) in a minty green Corsa. I am a serious hard-hitting journalist, I decided, not only with a company car but a shiny new expenses account. </p> <p>Never before have I filled a car with petrol, I realised as Corsa lurched into Texaco. Five minutes later, I had located the petrol hole. Twelve minutes later, the cap still covered it. Looking very businesslike in Nicki Hambleton-Jones mean specs and Ann Klein pencil skirt, I approach a leathery 4x4 driver on the neighbouring petrol pump.</p> <p>\"Erm, hello. Perhaps you could you help me.\"</p> <p>He looked up. Says nothing. </p> <p>\"- with the errr flap thingy, I can't quite open it.\"</p> <p>Damn it, what's it called. Leathery chap frowns slightly. So I say,</p> <p>\"On the car \u2013 the petrol flap.\"</p> <p>He understands. Obliges. Smiles. I glug in the petrol, inwardly proud, and decide he's not that bad looking for a forty-something. </p> <p>Hippy Traveller Friend sparked a relationship on the veg aisle in Somerfield. Well, sort of. After paying for her Munchies and pots of hummus and Lady Grey Twinings teabags at the same checkout for a few months \u2013 his checkout - they met in a party. They struck up a few words about the Matrix, I think. But he didn't ask her on a date until she popped back in to check out his checkout. Their first proper outing was a back-to-back X-Files session and five years on, she still goes to the same Somerfield. (Even though he's now a musician). </p> <p>Yes, sometimes cool is overrated, I decide. Leathery stands behind me in the shop queue and I imagine 4x4 drives through dusty Somerset villages on Sundays. Big Bald Shopman is saying something. I hand over my flashy new business expenses card. He says it again:</p> <p>\"Mileage.\"</p> <p>\"Erm, pardon?\"</p> <p>\"Mileage.\"</p> <p>He says it flat-pan. I wonder if mileage is a freebie or the Nectar Card of Texaco stations. They always mention in the Sainsburys queue, don't they? So I say,</p> <p>\"No thank you.\"</p> <p>He laughs, now. As does Acne Boy on the other till. </p> <p>\"No. I said mileage?\"</p> <p>It's a question now. He rises an octave at the end. So I say:</p> <p>\"I don't know, either.\"</p> <p>\"Where are you going?\"</p> <p>\"Somerset.\"</p> <p>\"On the M5?\"</p> <p>\"Oh no. I can only do A's, not M's.\"</p> <p>They are rocking about laughing now. They explain what mileage is and Leathery is breathing loud through his lips like he's impatient. My skirt feels a bit tight around my belly and the 'sultry' feels more like 'dumpy.' Then he speaks. (A bit Bristolian farmer for my liking). He says:</p> <p>\"You're not a natural are you?\"</p> <p>\"Haha, No. I'm most definitely a natural driver but this is my first time behind\u2026\"</p> <p>He cuts in. \"No, I meant natural blonde.\" And shakes his head a bit. </p> <p>Forget bumbling and the X-Files. There's something to be said for those glossy-haired women who don't spend their hours observing post boxes. Cool women who can carry off Halston Misa boots. Women who can fill up a petrol tank \u2013 in less than thirty minutes.</p>",

  "<p>Somewhere in New York City, there's a bar and a drink with your name on it. The choice is endless: places you go to with friends and places you go to meet new ones. There are bars for breaking up in, and bars for breaking down in. There are dive bars, swill bars and speakeasies\u2026 Your glass will runneth over. Here's the best of the spread:</p> <h2>1.

The conceit here is elixirs, perfumes and apothecaries. Viennese \"mixologist\" Albert Trummer, something of a legend among barmen, has divided his list into nine sections including \"euphoric enhancers\", \"pharmaceuticals\" and \"aphrodisiacs\". However, we'd suggest Trummer's homemade absinthe, which, even if it's not salubrious, is striking. </p> <p><strong>Find it at:</strong> 9 Doyers Street; +1 212 406 0400</p> <h2>4. PDT </h2> <p> <br>Reached through a phone booth attached to a hot dog joint, this East Village speakeasy is like Prohibition all over again. The cocktail list - devised by Jim Meehan, one of the city's best mixologists - is seasonal and includes Witch's Kiss, an autumnal concoction of Italian herbal liqueur Strega, tequila and lemon juice served in a coupe glass. Since opening in 2007, PDT - which stands for Please Don't Tell - has done a good job of being both public and private. There'll be no bar fights here, thank you. Aside from the cocktails and the coolness, the other main draws are the hotdogs, in particular the Wylie Dog by <a href=\"http://www.wd-50.com/\">WD-50</a>'s Wylie Dufresne, which includes a dollop of deep-fried mayo, and the Chang Dog by <a href=\"http://www.momofuku.com\">Momofuku</a> chef David Chang, which comes with hot homemade kimchi on top. </p> <p><strong>Find it at:</strong> 113 St. Marks Pl., New York, NY 10009; +1 212 614 0386; <a href=\"http://www.pdtnyc.com\">pdtnyc.com</a></p> <h2>5. Bb</h2> <p>The small oak-panelled room in Tribeca has room enough for a couple of booths, a long bar and a jazz trio - make that quartet, make that septet - that grows as the night ages and the city's jazz musicians filter in. The Japanese bartenders wear matching vests and maroon dress shirts and are experts at making ice balls, which involves using a large fish-bone knife to carve a block of ice into a perfect sphere. It's best enjoyed with a bourbon or whisky of which Bb has too many to count. </p> <p><strong>Find it at:</strong> 277 Church St, New York, NY 10013; +1 212 219 2970, <a href=\"http://www.bflat.info\">bflat.info</a></p> <h2>6. Russian Samovar</h2> <p> <br>Moscow is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087747/\">on the Hudson</a> but it's also alive and well on West 52nd St. Glass flagons of vodka, infused in house, are lined up like brightly-coloured soldiers: pepper, horseradish, peach, raspberry etc. In the shadowy recesses of the restaurant, you might find Mikhail Baryshnikov, an investor, quietly picking on blini imperial and pelmeni.</p> <p><strong>Find it at:</strong> 256 W.52nd Street; +1 212 757 0168; <a href=\"http://www.russiansamovar.com\">russiansamovar.com</a></p> <h2>7. Bohemian Hall and Beer Garden</h2> <p> <br>At one time there were 800 beer gardens in New York, many catering to Czech and Slovak refugees from the Austrio-Hungarian empire. Now there's only one original hall left. The Bohemian Hall - universally known as the Astoria Beer Garden for its Queens location - is to Slovak beer lovers the equivalent of the magic garden scene in Willy Wonka. There's a large outdoor patio with benches, sausages on the grill, kids running around, and old-time Czechs come together at picnic tables over big pitchers of hard-to-find old-world beers. </p> <p><strong>Find it at:</strong> 29-19 24th Avenue Astoria, New York 11102; +1 718 274 4925; <a href=\"http://www.bohemianhall.com\">bohemianhall.com</a></p> <h2>8. Winnie's</h2> <p>Not entirely wholesome, but, for my money, one of the best bars in Manhattan (maybe the world), Winnie's, in the maze-like streets of Chinatown, is a throbbing dive of karaoke, overly sweet cocktails and good times, where cool kids and Chinatown's own come to sing and sling. </p> <p><strong>Find it at:</strong> 104 Bayard St, New York, NY 10013; +1 212 732 2384</p> <h2>9. Julius</h2> <p>In a West Village that has become dismayingly gentrified and straight, Julius' Bar is unrepentantly old school and gay. The bar opened in the late 19th century. Many of the furnishings - the barrel tables, the footrest made of brass beagles - haven't changed. The clientele are mostly neighbourhood friends who drink at all hours under the thousands of eyes of famous and semi-famous patrons of past and present who gaze down from photographs lining the wall. There's a killer burger, too and, thankfully, none of the frattiness of other West Village bars. </p> <p><strong>Find it at:</strong> 159 West 10th St and Waverly Place; +1 212 929 9672</p> <h2>10. Bemelmans Bar </h2> <p>Some bars are for drinking, some are for people watching. Hotel bars combine the two and none more so than the Bemelman's Bar at the Carlyle Hotel. Like a spiderweb for the rich and dissolute, the bar catches nearby midtown strollers, ladies of leisure, trysting couples, and wide-eyed hotel guests. It is named after Ludwig Bemelmans, the creator of the <a href=\"http://www.madeline.com/\">Madeline books</a>, whose murals of animals mid-frolick adorn the walls of the bar. The drinks - including the addictive Old Cuban, a mojito topped with champagne - are pricey but the people parade is more than worth it. </p> <p><strong>Find it at:</strong> Hotel Carlyle, 35 E. 76th St; +1 212 744 1600; <a href=\"http://www.thecarlyle.com\">thecarlyle.com</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">Oil </a>prices fell below $108 a barrel today after the passing of Hurricane Gustav and as worries over the health of the global economy and the impact on energy demand revived.</p> <p>US crude oil prices fell nearly $2 to $107.71 a barrel this morning after early signs that Hurricane Gustav caused less damage in the Gulf of Mexico than feared. Traders then turned their attention to weakening demand for oil from a slowing economy. Oil has tumbled more than $6 since Friday and is down nearly 30% since the recent record high of $148 a barrel.</p> <p>In London, Brent crude dropped to $107.25 a barrel.</p> <p>\"It's the economy, economy, economy. Everyone's worried about demand destruction,\" said Robert Nunan, a risk management executive at Tokyo-based Mitsubishi.</p> <p>The dollar rose to an 11-month high against a basket of major currencies.</p> <p>Sterling continued to slide after a slate of economic figures reinforced the view that the British economy is slipping into recession and blunt comments from the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/30/economy.alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a>, who warned of the worst slump in 60 years. </p> <p>The pound dropped to its lowest level against the dollar in two and a half years of $1.7703 this morning. Measured against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, sterling is at at 12-year low.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you for that warm welcome. I am honoured to be here. </p> <p>We meet tonight in the wake of a terrible storm that has hit the gulf coast but that hurts all of us, because we are all members of our larger American family. </p> <p>At times like this, we set aside all that divides us, and we come together to help our fellow citizens in need. </p> <p>What matters is certainly not whether we are Democrats or Republicans, but that we are all Americans. </p> <p>The truth is, it shouldn't take a hurricane to bring us together like this. </p> <p>Every day, across our country, millions of our fellow citizens are facing huge problems. </p> <p>They are worried about their homes, their jobs and their businesses; they are worried about the outrageous cost of gas and of health insurance; and they are worried about the threats from our enemies abroad. </p> <p>But when they look to Washington, all too often they do not see their leaders coming together to tackle these problems. </p> <p>Instead they see Democrats and Republicans fighting each other, rather than fighting for the American people. </p> <p>Our founding fathers foresaw the danger of this kind of senseless partisanship. George Washington himself - in his farewell address to our country - warned that the \"spirit of party\" is \"the worst enemy\" of our democracy and \"enfeebles\" our government's ability to do its job. </p> <p>George Washington was absolutely right. The sad truth is - today we are living through his worst nightmare, in the capital city that bears his name. </p> <p>And that brings me directly to why I am here tonight. What, after all, is a Democrat like me doing at a Republican convention like this? </p> <p>The answer is simple. </p> <p>I'm here to support John McCain because country matters more than party. </p> <p>I'm here tonight because John McCain is the best choice to bring our country together and lead our country forward. </p> <p>I'm here because John McCain's whole life testifies to a great truth: being a Democrat or a Republican is important. </p> <p>But it is not more important than being an American. </p> <p>Both presidential candidates this year talk about changing the culture of Washington, about breaking through the partisan gridlock and special interests that are poisoning our politics. </p> <p>But only one of them has actually done it. </p> <p>Only one leader has shown the courage and the capability to rise above the smallness of our politics to get big things done for our country and our people. </p> <p>And that leader is John McCain! </p> <p>John understands that it shouldn't take a natural disaster like Hurricane Gustav to get us to take off our partisan blinders and work together to get things done. </p> <p>It shouldn't take a natural disaster to teach us that the American people don't care much if you have an \"r\" or a \"d\" after your name. </p> <p>What they care about is, are we solving the problems they are up against every day? </p> <p>What you can expect from John McCain as president is precisely what he has done this week: which is to put country first. That is the code by which he has lived his entire life, and that is the code he will carry with him into the White House. </p> <p>I have personally seen John, over and over again, bring people together from both parties to tackle our toughest problems we face - to reform our campaign finance, lobbying and ethics laws, to create the 9/11 Commission and pass its critical national security reforms, and to end the partisan paralysis over judicial confirmations. </p> <p>My Democratic friends know all about John's record of independence and accomplishment. </p> <p>Maybe that's why some of them are spending so much time and so much money trying to convince voters that John McCain is someone else. </p> <p>I'm here, as a Democrat myself, to tell you: don't be fooled. </p> <p>God only made one John McCain, and he is his own man. </p> <p>If John McCain was just another go-along partisan politician, he never would have taken on corrupt Republican lobbyists, or big corporations that were cheating the American people, or powerful colleagues in Congress who were wasting taxpayer money. </p> <p>But he did! </p> <p>If John McCain was just another go-along partisan politician, he never would have led the fight to fix our broken immigration system or to do something about global warming. </p> <p>But he did! </p> <p>As a matter of fact, if John McCain is just another partisan Republican, then I'm Michael Moore's favorite Democrat. </p> <p>And I'm not. </p> <p>Senator Obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead. But eloquence is no substitute for a record - not in these tough times. </p> <p>In the Senate he has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done, nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the Democratic party. </p> <p>Contrast that to John McCain's record, or the record of the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton, who stood up to some of those same Democratic interest groups and worked with Republicans to get important things done like welfare reform, free trade agreements and a balanced budget. </p> <p>Governor Sarah Palin, like John McCain, is a reformer who has taken on the special interests and reached across party lines. She is a leader we can count on to help John shake up Washington. </p> <p>That's why the McCain-Palin ticket is the real ticket for change this year. </p> <p>The Washington bureaucrats and power brokers can't build a pen strong enough to hold these two mavericks. </p> <p>And together, you can count on John McCain and Sarah Palin to fight for America and to fight for you! And that's what our country needs most right now. </p> <p>What we need most is not more party unity in America but more national unity! </p> <p>Especially at a time of war, we need a president we can count on to fight for what's right for our country - not only when it is easy, but when it is hard. </p> <p>When others were silent, John McCain had the judgment to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in Iraq. When others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle, when Barack Obama was voting to cut off funding for our troops on the ground.</p> <p>John McCain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion and support the surge, and because of that, today, our troops are at last beginning to come home, not in failure, but in honor! </p> <p>Before I conclude, I ask the indulgence of those in this hall tonight, as I want to speak directly to my fellow Democrats and Independents who are watching. </p> <p>I know many of you are angry and frustrated by our government and our politics and for good reason. </p> <p>You may be thinking of voting for John McCain but you're not sure. Some of you have never voted for a Republican before and in an ordinary election, you probably wouldn't. </p> <p>But this is no ordinary election, because these are not ordinary times, and John McCain is no ordinary candidate. You may not agree with John McCain on every issue. </p> <p>But you can always count on him to be straight with you about where he stands, and to stand for what he thinks is right regardless of politics. </p> <p>As president, you can count on John McCain to be a restless reformer, who will clean up Washington and get our government working again for you! </p> <p>So tonight, I ask you whether you are an Independent, a Reagan Democrat or a Clinton Democrat, or just a Democrat: This year, when you vote for president, vote for the person you believe is best for the country, not for the party you happen to belong to. </p> <p>Vote for the leader who, since the age of 17, when he raised his hand and took an oath to defend and protect our Constitution, has always put our country first. </p> <p>So, let's come together to make a great American patriot our next great president!</p>"
