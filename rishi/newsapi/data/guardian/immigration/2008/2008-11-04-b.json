However, exit polls later in the day saw voters under 30, the target demographic of the Obama camp, voting at about the same levels as in 2004.</p> <p>That would be a disappointment for the Obama camp, which had been hoping that young voters would buck the tradition of showing enthusiasm for a candidate and then failing to turn out on the day. Exit polls did chart a rise in African-American turnout.</p> <p>The stock market experienced its biggest election day rally in 24 years on expectation of an Obama victory.</p> <p>Independent election monitors reported sporadic instances of delayed openings of polling stations, broken voting machines, ballot shortages, voter confusion and occasional abuse in a number of battleground states including Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Virginia.</p> <p>The McCain camp raised its own charges of irregularities, accusing Black Panther activists holding nightsticks and standing outside Philadelphia polling stations, in an attempt to intimidate white voters.</p> <p>McCain also accused out-of-state Obama volunteers of casting votes in Florida, and of voters casting multiple ballots in Florida.</p> <p>Reflecting the intensity of the campaign, Obama and McCain put in a final burst of campaigning after casting their own votes. </p> <p>Obama made a final dash from his home in Chicago to neighbouring Indiana, which was Republican in 2004. Reporters travelling with him reported that the candidate was in a subdued rather than celebratory mood, perhaps reflecting the news of the death of his grandmother yesterday. </p> <p>Obama told them that whatever happened, the campaign, the costliest in US history at over $1 billion (\u00a3630m) as well as the longest, had been \"extraordinary\".</p> <p>At Obama headquarters in Chicago, a campaign worker described the mood as \"optimistically nauseous\", reflecting both the party's hopes but the lingering fear after Democratic defeats to Bush in 2000 and 2004.</p> <p>McCain, who at 72 would be the oldest ever US president, made late dashes to New Mexico and Colorado, both of which were also Republican in 2004, before returning to his native Arizona to vote. </p> <p>The Republican said he remained in contention - and was hoping for a surprise win. But there was an elegiac quality to his insistence. \"Look, I know I'm still the underdog, I understand that,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You can't imagine the excitement of an individual to be this close to the most important position in the world, and I'll enjoy it. I'll never forget it as long as I live.\"</p> <p>The excitement generated by the campaign translated into high voter turnout, with election officials reporting extraordinary levels of interest - to the extent that authorities in Colorado warned they might not be able to finish the count until tomorrow. <br> The next president will inherit horrendous economic problems that will limit the scope of his ambitions. </p> <p>Obama, in his final rallies, was already tempering his early promise of change with warnings about how he would have to curb some of his more ambitious plans, trying to lower expectations that he would be able to move quickly on health care and education reform.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>6pm:</strong> At 7pm ET, all eyes will be on the news channels as the results start to come in, the pundits sing for their supper and the graphics machines go into such overdrive that small puffs of graphic smoke start puffing out the top.</p> <p>I'll be here, flicking through the channels, trying to decide who's got the sharpest coverage, the flashiest maps, the choicest quotes, the biggest hair and, most importantly, who's going to claim to call the whole election first. </p> <p>If you're watching the coverage on TV, listening on the radio or following on the internet, join me to cover the coverage and democratise the punditry with any choice observances you happen to witness as, try as I might, I can't watch twelve channels at once. (Sadly)</p> <p>Back at 7pm, Midnight or 4pm (depending on where you are). Whatever: in an hour, anyway.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>7:07pm:</strong> The sense of urgency is palpable. And, finally, meaningful. </p> <p>The polls are closing, the pundits are gearing up to actually say real things about real facts. Yes, \"Get READY\" says CNN \"We are about to make a A PROJECTION\" which isn't the most exciting turn of phrase anyone's ever heard.</p> <p>Still, at least from here on in we'll be seeing projections based on real live news. Up to this point they're been sitting around a table, banks of them, five along one desk on CNN, with no less than eight laptops in front of them making urgent pronouncements on what we might just be going to see once those polls have closed (just like they have been for the last six months or more)</p> <p>But now they're closed. In Indiana the projection is that Obama should win. And based on the 4% of numbers that have come back in that state so far, he's lagging behind 49% to McCain's 51%.</p> <p>More importantly, the technology of CNN is lagging behind practically everyone else. Seven foot 2d screens? Really, who cares. If it isn't 3d, no one's impressed anymore, are they?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7:15pm:</strong> Fox News is making a projection that McCain will win Kentucky. Please try to hide your surprise. Their desk has only four pundits, and no laptops at all, though, so what do they know? </p> <p>One of those pundits, however, is a pretty Palin-a-like, complete with bright red jacket; which may be showing some kind of sisterhood and support, but frankly sitting by the muted suits of the other frowning pundits, it's eye-bleedingly bright.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>7:24pm:</strong> \"Jessica, You were a terrific hologram, thanks very much\". Seriously, I take back what I ever said about CNN's coverage. The seven-foot screens were only the beginning. </p> <p>Jessica, you see, was in Chicago, and appeared not by satellite, But By Hologram right there in the middle of the CNN Election Centre. Perhaps a little smaller than she might be in real life, but just as 3D, she talked directly about what was going on there (nothing, but that's not the point, she was a sodding hologram) and how the technology worked (magic) and then she suddenly leant forward and whispered urgently: <em>Help me CNN Election Centre, you're my only hope</em> reached out, and the picture flickered to nothing.</p> <p>I have no idea what it all means, but it's great to see the advances of technology aren't being wasted.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>7:33pm:</strong> According to my local news - as if any of you care - Frank my friendly local anchor is ruling over a lot of really over-excitable local reporters jabbering faster than they ever have in their life. </p> <p>Key points of the election coverage in San Francisco so far, then, include trying to top the queue length of the last correspondent (lines here have been more than TWENTY FIVE minutes long!), saying 'ahhhhhh?' a lot between sentences, and staring into the camera like a startled rabbit.</p> <p>However, I will be keeping an eye on it, if you don't mind, because the possible passing of Proposition 8 - which will ban gay marriage only six months after it became legal; a big talking point here.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>7:43pm:</strong> Back on CNN, one of my IM correspondents (I promise you, I have more laptop screens open than CNN here) Mark C, has observed that Brit Hume looks like a man who hasn't got around to taking off his halloween costume yet - and went to the party dressed as the undead. </p> <p>Meanwhile, we've just had a brilliant snafu on Fox - David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, appeared live via satellite to talk to the immaculately coiffured semi-plasticated Shepherd Smith. </p> <p>\"So David, you've been very busy, and your second child was due yesterday. Any news yet David?\" Said Shepherd<br>\"Well, Charlie, it's too early to be exuberant yet, so I'm cautious\" Said David.</p> <p>What? Well, I mean, childbirth is always a nervous time, but come on, it's your second child! What?</p> <p>After only a couple more questions, it became clear that while Shepherd was talking to David, David was talking to Charlie on ABC and had no idea that Shepherd and Fox had got the feed all wrong. The possibility of people answering questions entirely inappropriately was tantalising, but never quite lived up to the promise, damnit.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7:50pm:</strong> My sister is reporting a man with a magnificent rug on the BBC coverage, can anyone confirm?</p> <p>On CNBC, a table of four pundits (two laptops) keeps splitting into a siz-way shouting match. The fact that some of them are actually sitting next to each other in real life means that they're looking left and right when they shout and, when in splitscreen mode, look like the Brady Bunch. It's brilliant. Quite makes up for the fact that they're shouting \"I think it's WRANG to be a deficit hawk!\" which out of context makes absolutely no sense at all (and doesn't sound like anything the Brady Bunch would say).</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>8:02pm:</strong> With the news from Asta in the comments that NBC is not only making great use of the Rockerfeller Centre Ice Rink for their red/blue map, but also is talking to Ann Curry (\"The same Ann Curry who was once voted America's dumbest TV journalist.\" says Asta) I immediately turn to MSNBC to find stirring horns and many many stars and stripes fluttering in front of the Rockerfeller centre. </p> <p>Nothing interesting happens there, though. Lots of graphics reading 'TOO EARLY TO CALL!' - they're all being very cautious, on every channel, in fact - and really don't want to say anything until they're sure. And probably a very good plan. Does make for slightly less pleasing viewing, though, if we know we're going to have to wait all the way down to the wire to know for sure. <br>I mean, come <em>on</em>; I'm missing a rerun of Gilmore Girls for this.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>8:10pm:</strong> Incidentally, as the second wave of polls close - I should have mentioned earlier: if you're looking for numbers, stats and hard news on the results as they come in, this blog is totally not the one where you'll find those things. You'll be wanting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama6\">Oliver's brilliant blog over yonder</a>. We're purely about touchscreens, satellite links, bad toupees and magic holograms over here. And pizza. Hopefully.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8:21pm:</strong> On CNN, we're cutting by satellite to the places where one loser and one winner will later speak.</p> <p>At Camp Obama, Suzanne Malveaux is shouting into a microphone that they've basically had to stick right inside her mouth to be heard. The last two times they cut to her, they couldn't hear a single word. This time we can hear, at least, the kind of words you can always hear when people have those rock-star microphones, you can hear someone shouting '<em>FUZZ YOFFLE JZUJZ AN OBAMA SCHZH!</em>\" like they're trying to land a fighter plane. The people in Grant Park behind her are yelling and excited. Very VERY excited.</p> <p>Dana Bash is in a ballroom in Phoenix, where a the Phoenix Boy's choir is singing a quiet, mournful number while people stand around and sip wine in a totally plumberesque, unelitist fashion. What's the mood there, she's asked by Wolf Blitzer? Oh, quiet, she says. Realistic. Stoic. </p> <p>Stoic. Interesting word.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>8:42pm:</strong> On Fox, the state is called by a graphic of the faces of McCain and Obama flipping on individual cards like that Victorian optical illusion with a bird on one side and a cage on the other where a spinning thread puts the bird inside the cage. There is therefore a lot more that could be done with this graphic. McCain on one side of the spinning graphic, a beautiful bouncing baby on the other: spin the graphic, McCain kisses the baby. Obama on one side of the spinning card, Bill Ayers on the other, spin the card, 'Bama cavorts with terrorists! Come ON, Fox, you just weren't working hard enough with those now, were you.</p> <p>Meanwhile, they're showing the massive swell of supporters who have turned up to Grant Park in hope of seeing a new president speak later on. \"That's a great turn out\" the anchor and correspondent agree. \"Barack Obama; lucky with the weather. AGAIN.\"</p> <p>Yes. That's why those people are there. It's not raining.</p> <p>Anyone curious about the BBC toupee question, meanwhile, can enter the debate on a more informed level by looking at the screengrab someone's helpfully uploaded for me <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrbiggs/3003525421/\">here</a>. I say it IS. What do you say?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9:18pm:</strong> If I'm informed one more time on one more channel that 270 is a magic number, I may take 270 pencils, and stick one up a single nostril on 270 news anchors. </p> <p>At the moment, as the polls close but remain too close to call and the map fills up with 'Dunno Yet Yellow', the battle of the touchscreen against the CGI is on. On CNN, voter analysis with crazy hands on a touch-sensitive whiteboard reveals things that people either knew already or can't analyse - apparently 52% of people said that race was a motivating factor and, in a seperate question, 53% race made no difference to their vote at all. </p> <p>MSNBC, meanwhile, presents the staes so far from entirely within a virtual sentate. Virtual columns and a virtual whiteboard (that's almost exactly the same size and shape as CNN's REAL whiteboard, but weirdly higher-tech because it's completely non-physical) surround the man who stands by a real podium - one real laptop in front of him - pointing at the whiteboard behind him that isn't there.</p> <p>And yet none of them is saying anything wildly different. And most of them, with great anticipation and breathless portent, are barely saying anything at all.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9:35pm:</strong> Katie Couric - and I can't believe we've neglected her so far, apologies to all her fans - is being more strident on CBS than anyone I've so far seen. \"Obama's on 190 votes, on his way to 270\" (270? Really? Is that an important number, then?) \"and the presidency; John McCain's running out of ways to win. This is election night in USA\" she says, sounding a little bit like she's called it already.</p> <p>She also has great hair.</p> <p>ABC's on the streets of New York, amid the crowds in Times square, shouting happy shouts to keep themselves warm. At least I <em>think</em> that's why they're doing it, unless they've secretly been listening to Katie Couric.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9:48pm:</strong> You know what's an important number, as well as 270? 3. Three is, as De La Soul once said, a magic number. Because the channels don't want to call things until they feel completely sure ... but then most of them seem to feel sure enough to call it once 3% of precincts in any particular state have declared.</p> <p>On ABC, they're going further than Times Square. Correspondent for the Continent of Africa (I think that's her official title) Dana is in Kenya, in Kogelo, in fact, the ancestral home of the Obama family. </p> <p>We're told, before we speak to her, that the world's press have descended on this tiny, rural community, and we can see the towns people gathered behind Dana on plastic chairs wearing colourful baseball caps, faces lit by something just off screen.</p> <p>Before we cut to Dana (by live satellite link), the studio has a question: \"Just how accurate are the results they're getting there? Are they getting results at all yet? Are they at all up to date?\"</p> <p>And how are they getting those? Is it by smoke signal? Or by carrier pigeon? Or perhaps - call me crazy - by Live Satellite Link?</p> <p>Sadly Dana cannot hear us, ABC's feed keeps cutting out.</p> <p>\"In this tiny village, where there are usually only less than 500 people, there is actually a LARGE SCREEN where they are actually watching INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION and the results are actually coming in, as quickly as they are over there, and they're actually CHEERING as the results come in from each state!\"</p> <p>Are they? Actually? In AFRICA? Madness!<br>Well, they can't be watching it on ABC, then, their feed is shonky. They're probably tuned to the CNN - or someone else with the 3% rule.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9:56pm:</strong> \"We're going to take a break, while we eat cookies, and then we'll be right back\"</p> <p>CNN may have holograms, ABC definitely has a Correspondent for the Continent of Africa: Fox has biscuits someone's brought in, decorated to look like a high-def widescreen TV tuned immovably to Fox News.</p> <p>I can't help but wonder if, as I flick through the channels, I'm always <em>just</em> missing the really awesome technological advances in television graphics.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>10.05pm:</strong> Ok, it's 10pm on the East Coast, Silly AM in the UK and almost Pizza O'Clock at my house, and on twitter I'm seeing lots of people calling it already. Iowa for Obama, they say, and with California and other big blue states yet to be called, the internet is starting to buzz with early calls.</p> <p>\"Every time they call it for Barack, we take a shot\" says <a href=\"http://twitter.com/TinaFey/status/990699933\">Tina Fey on Twitter</a>. I like the woman's style, but I hope someone else is driving her home, because she's going to be HAMMERED in a minute.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>10:39pm:</strong> It's remarkable when you flick over and see the local channels who don't have the big network billions to throw at fancy graphics. It feels like you're travelling back in time, like suddenly they'll cut to the weather and someone will start placing large magnetic clouds on gaudy-coloured maps. These flat 2D images of a giant USA, states coloured a stark RED or a BLUE with no sense of sensitive aesthetic judgement involved. </p> <p>Hell, on ABC the maps may be flat but they're shaded, county by county throughout the state, redder where the vote is stronger, fading to a gentle pastel pink blush where the Rebulicans won but only barely. It's a mottled, marbled view of the major election on a macro scale, and as the analysts take their magic pens and scrawl illustrative circles and arrows and marks on the screen, it somewhat feels like someone's taking a felt tip to a Georges Seurat painting.</p> <p>Well, kinda.</p> <p>Anyway, as they're moving through, rushing from delicately shaded red state to delicately blushing blue one, it means very little at all - would be great if you could stop and look in depth, but there is not time, for depth, just impressive graphics, my friends. So it basically, at this speed, means feck-all.</p> <p>Looks purdy, though.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>10:49pm:</strong> I'd be doing some more channel-flicking if I hadn't got rather stuck staring at Katie Couric. She really is remarkable. Looking, I mean. There's just something ethereal about her. And I'm trying to decide what that is, so I'm having to watch correspondent after correspondent in split screen interviews until I can see someone next to her in real life to decide.</p> <p>Because if she's always in soft focus, that's one thing, and all very well. So then whoever sat next to her would also be in soft focus, and we would know.</p> <p>But it's almost more than that. It's almost as if she looks like she's <strong>always</strong> in soft focus. So if you met her in person, you'd just be overwhelmed by the fact her features are all slightly blurred. <br>Perhaps she has a soft downy fur covering her that diffuses the light from the cameras?<br>Or perhaps, like a beautiful pumpkin lantern, she has some kind of softly flickering internal light source?<br>Or maybe she releases a fine mist of steam into the air around her, to create a more flattering focus for her face at any angle they might catch?</p> <p>Whatever it is, it's remarkable. Please, let's drink to Katie Couric.</p> <p>Or, perhaps, to Obama. Who, from the returns starting to dribble in ever faster, seems to be pulling off a pretty crushing win. The people in Grant Park in Chicago seem to be feeling it, though. A million of them, standing and waiting. A million? Really? Wow.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>10:56pm:</strong> The internet is buzzing with the rumour that all the networks will call it officially at 11pm ET. That's four minutes from now.</p> <p>I'm excitedly waiting, and desperately trying to decide quickly which channel to watch it on. They're all much of a muchness, but Fox may be sweetest, I suppose...</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>11:02pm:</strong> AND THEY'VE CALLED IT. </p> <p>Every single network, has it on big screens BARACK OBAMA ELECTED PRESIDENT.</p> <p>CNN with shots of a cheering Grant Park, Fox with glasses tipped to the end of the nose and a mournful face. MSNBC has college students cheering and children jumping up and down in Times Square, on ANC the noise is deafening.</p> <p>This is, frankly, a very exciting thing to watch.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>11:13pm:</strong> \"There's always celebration on one side or the other\" says ABC, with great analytical flair \"but I've never seen anything like this\"</p> <p>On CNN, they're quoting from Martin Luth King Jr and from the constitution.</p> <p>On Fox they're talking about Bill Ayers ... but then moving on to say what a promising figure Obama is and how they've thought so all along.</p> <p>MSNBC are doing a marathon voiceover over crowds of cheering people in Grant Park (\"<em> ... And the remarkable thing about the fact that the analysis will prove that the crowds came out in numbers like were never before imagined when they thought about what kind of numbers might possibly be imaginable at such a time and in such an occasion when ...</em>\" Oh, God Bless rolling news)</p> <p>And on the comedy network Stephen Colbert has a parrot on his shoulder.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>11:24pm:</strong> The camera has been lingering on The Reverend Jesse Jackson having a cry in the crowd at grant park for around four minutes now.</p> <p>In fact, the only thing that could possibly make them cut away, makes them cut: </p> <p><strong>A concession speech by John McCain.</strong></p> <p>\"A few minutes ago, I had the honour of calling Senator Obama ...\"</p> <p><em>BOOOOO, BOOOOOO!</em> says the crowd, quietened only slightly by the soft padding hands of John McCain.</p> <p>\"... and congratulating him\"</p> <p><em>Booooo! BOOOOO!</em><br>Pad pad. </p> <p>He talks about Booker T Washington and the importance of bridging differences, moving on, and supporting the new president whoever they may have supported up till now.</p> <p>\"We have failed. And those we fell short, the failure was mine, not yours\" he says, voice cracking. Before thanking Cindy, the children, and his mother. HIS MOTHER? Seriously?</p> <p>He thanks Sarah Palin, and the crowd goes absolutely wild. Palin 2012 it is, then? She stands next to him, and cries a little. She's going to speak too, right?</p> <p>\"Thank you, and God Bless you and God Bless America\" he ends a gracious and diplomatic and delicate concession speech before leaving and hugging a lady we can only assume to be his mother (as she is about 238)</p> <p><strong><em>U! S! A! U! S! A!</em></strong> Chants the crowd, as crowds will on these kinds of occasions. Will Sarah speak now? I hope she will. I'll miss her so very, very much.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>11:46pm:</strong> Anderson Cooper, whose name sounds like a firm of accountants, and Wolf Blitzer, whose name sounds like a helicopter hunting trip holiday company from Alaska, are filling time before the President Elect - and that would be Mr Barack Obama (who sounds like a piece of designer wooden furniture) - comes on stage and makes his victory speech. <br>There's very little rolling news can add to this moment now. <br>It's momentous without any help.</p> <p>And so that's where I should leave you, and point you over to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\">Oliver's main liveblog</a>, as unless the graphics start exploding or the hologram comes back (I'm not sure they can afford for the hologram to come back, otherwise they'd all have just done it via hologram all evening, it was that cool) there's not much more I can say.</p> <p><strong>Thank you, and good night.</strong></p> <p><em>Thanks for reading, and for your comments. And to those who have supported President-Elect Obama in any way, shape or form, congratulations. I'm going to go and raise a slice of pizza and a glass of very nice wine in your honour.

  "<p>Doesn't it seem odd that it'll soon be over -- this insane, historic, aggravating, stirring, inspiring, profoundly moving and ridiculous thing that's been a part of our lives for so many months? But the final rallies have taken place, and in a few hours, barring the completely unforeseen, it really will end, amid guaranteed scenes of intense emotion. More than enough has already been written and said about the momentous nature of the choice America faces in this election, and the decision that all the polls suggest it's going to make, so I won't add to that for now. I'll just say this: I'll be liveblogging right here in a short while (at <strong>6pm eastern, 11pm UK time</strong>), bringing you all the presidential results and highlights of the congressional elections as they happen, along with reports from our team in Chicago, Phoenix and elsewhere, and I hope you'll join me.</p> <p><strong>The basics</strong></p> <p>Daniel Nasaw's most excellent guide to the evening is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/04/us-president-election-guide\">here</a>, and I added some thoughts about when and how we can expect the various states to be called tonight <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama5\">here</a>. Oh -- and I just remembered that CNN will be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/30/uselections2008\">interviewing holograms</a>; on any other evening this would surely be the most exciting thing imaginable.</p> <p><strong>Paths to victory</strong></p> <p>The simplest way to look at where we stand tonight is probably this: Barack Obama should win all the states John Kerry won in 2004, despite John McCain's efforts to grab Pennsylvania and (a longer shot) New Hampshire. If he does win the Kerry states, he needs only Florida or Ohio and he's won 270 electoral votes. But before we hear results from those states, we'll almost certainly hear from Virginia: if Obama wins there, he doesn't need Florida or Ohio so long as he gets one of the other battlegrounds -- Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, New Mexico, Nevada or North Carolina. (We won't know for sure that he's won, of course, until the Kerry states come in for the Democrats, so the networks will definitely wait for Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, and maybe the others -- not that McCain is going to win California in any remotely credible universe.) If Obama wins none of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, he can certainly still win, but he'll need a combination of those other battlegrounds as well. </p> <p><strong>When will we know?</strong></p> <p>The big problem in constructing any kind of timetable for the night is that we don't know the gap between the closing of polls in a given state, and the calling by the networks: a state closing first doesn't mean it'll be called first, and Florida, especially, will probably keep us waiting. But here's a rough idea of the first half of the evening. At <strong>6pm/11pm</strong>, polls begin to close in <strong>Kentucky and Indiana</strong> (though not in the whole state till <strong>7pm/midnight</strong>); then at 7pm/midnight polls close in <strong>Virginia, Georgia</strong>, and most of <strong>Florida</strong> and <strong>New Hampshire</strong>. Kentucky's a shoo-in for McCain, but Obama is only trailing slightly now in Indiana and Georgia. If either state isn't quickly called for McCain, he's in for a very bad night; should Obama win Indiana, he's in for a landslide. (Results from the west of the state, which is Obama territory near Chicago, will arrive later than in the Republican east.) If Obama wins Virginia alone among all these early states, McCain is going to need to do very well among the tossups, or seize Pennsylvania. </p> <p>At <strong>7.30pm/12.30am</strong> polls close in <strong>Ohio</strong> and <strong>North Carolina</strong>. An Ohio win effectively hands Obama the election, though you'd want to wait for <strong>Pennsyvlania</strong> to be sure; polls close there at <strong>8pm</strong> as they do in 17 other states plus Washington DC, including the swing state of <strong>Missouri</strong>. </p> <p>Got all that? If McCain doesn't win Pennsylvania, and the polls suggest he won't, he'd have to win every single tossup state in order to squeak to victory. So it's perfectly likely this will all be over by about <strong>9pm/2am</strong>. But some people probably said something similar in 2000...<br> <strong>House, Senate, governors</strong></p> <p>I'll bring you highlights of these, at least until we know the identity of the president. Democrats, who lead in the Senate 51-49 (relying on Joe the Lieberman), might get 60 seats -- a filibuster-proof majority, making a Democratic president's work much easier -- for the first time in a generation. They control the House 235-199; if they make gains of 20 or more, we can call that a landslide. Eleven governorships are up for grabs, but it's only North Carolina and Washington where things are close. Democrats currently hold them both.</p> <p><strong>Join in</strong> </p> <p>I want to know where you are, how you're marking tonight, what you're eating and drinking, how you're feeling, what your gut's telling you -- all that stuff. And you might as well tell me, in the comments, because I'm certainly going to be telling you. (I also have fantasies that somebody's following this blog from Vanuatu, or Antarctica, or Pitcairn, so can you please pretend that you are even if you're not?) In an emotional return to the beer consumed during the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama\">first presidential debate liveblog</a>, all those weeks ago, my choice tonight is <a href=\"http://www.sierranevada.com/\">Sierra Nevada</a>. History, plus beer, here in a little while. </p> <p><strong>6.15pm</strong> (all times eastern from now on): So, polls in most of Indiana and half of Kentucky have closed. In the earliest national exit poll data, which has been dribbling out for a little while now, more than 60% said the economy was their main voting issue. 67% worry about being able to afford healthcare. It's all very different from the \"values\" focus of 2004. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/election.president/index.html\">Here's more.</a> Karl Rove is burbling away on Fox at the moment; he says it's the first time since he was 18 years old that he hasn't been directly involved in a presidential election...</p> <p><strong>6.21pm</strong> From the comments: nice to know we're being read in the San Francisco Obama phonebank headquarters, while commenter <strong>evalgoiavot</strong> notes: \"I just watched three epidsodes of battlestar galactica back to back to relieve the tension. I DEMAND CERTAINTY! and also more whisky.\"]</p> <p><strong>6.29pm</strong> For ceremonial reasons, let's mark the first results of the election, even though they're completely meaningless: with fewer than one per cent of votes in, Obama leads McCain 55%-44% in Indiana, while McCain, amazingly enough, leads in Kentucky.</p> <p><strong>6.47pm</strong> OK, back after brief technical issues. Apologies. 13 minutes until polls close in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. Many fantastic comments. </p> <p><strong>6.55pm</strong> The first state exit polls, which are leaking in various places, look a fair bit tighter than some of the polls. Leads of 4%, 2%, 1% and 1% respectively for Obama in PA, VA, FL and OH. But we know there are <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/ten-reasons-why-you-should-ignore-exit.html\">lots of reasons to distrust exit polls</a>, right?</p> <p><strong>6.56pm</strong> Judging by the comments, almost all of you have better food and drink than me tonight. Thanks for that. Also, where are CNN's holograms -- huh?</p> <p><strong>7.00pm</strong> Polls close in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/steve-schmidt-remarks-on-straight-talk-air/?xid=rss-page\">Here</a> are the final words on the McCain campaign from McCain's senior strategist Steve Schmidt, although to be honest I'm not sure what the heck they mean. \"Crossing the finish line head up\"? </p> <p><strong>7.01pm</strong> CNN and others call <strong>Vermont</strong> for Obama and <strong>Kentucky</strong> for McCain. Entirely unsurprising! So we begin our electoral college vote count:</p> <p><strong>Obama 3 McCain 8</strong></p> <p><strong>7.10pm</strong> MSNBC predicts a House composition of Dem 261 Rep 174 -- a Democratic landslide -- though there's a significant margin of error to that. Meanwhile: the fact that we don't yet have a call on Indiana is surely a sign that it's going to damn close, isn't it? (Oh -- yes, indeed, the networks and AP agree that it's \"too close to call\", as opposed to simply too early to call. So much for my astonishing Punditry Insight.) Mark Warner, the Democrat, is expected to win the Virginia senate seat he's contesting against Jim Gilmore, which makes a Senate net gain of one.</p> <p><strong>Senate Dem net gain +1</strong></p> <p><strong>7.14pm</strong> Let the record show that Wolf Blitzer is, now, finally, talking to holograms on CNN. They look like slightly worse versions of the holograms in Star Wars, and while they probably look amazing to Wolf they just look like superimposed images to everyone else. Money well spent, CNN!</p> <p><strong>7.23pm</strong> Crowds have begun streaming into Grant Park, Chicago, from where I expect soon to hear from Jonathan Freedland; everybody's running madly for a front-row position. I wonder if any of them <a href=\"http://current.com/items/89474691_will_trade_sex_for_obama_tickets\">got them on Craiglist in highly suspicious circumstances</a>? McCain leads 53% to 46% with 2% of precincts in; McCain leading 51% to 48% in Indiana with 12% in. Mike Tomasky <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-indiana\">has thoughts</a> on the Indiana situation...</p> <p><strong>7.29pm</strong> OK, real news. Official demographic exit polls, extrapolated to the statewide vote -- a very unreliable exercise -- put Obama at 54%-45% in Virginia and 52%-46% in Indiana. Remember, in 04 the exits said Kerry had won...</p> <p><strong>7.30pm</strong> Polls close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia; Fox calls <strong>West Virginia</strong> for McCain, which would be Obama 3 McCain 13 -- nobody else is following suit yet.</p> <p><strong>7.35pm</strong> Dan Glaister checks in from outside the Frank Lloyd Wright Ballroom of the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, where McCain will hold his election night party (although not necessarily attend it, oddly). Two cleaners just left the ballroom. \"Where are all the people, then?\" one said. \"I thought there'd be lots more people than this,\" the other replied. A thrilling atmosphere of excitement, then.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell's seat in Kentucky is too close to call -- a bad sign for the Republicans, and a hint that the Democrats might be in with a shot of their 60-majority goal.</p> <p><strong>7.41pm</strong> Obama;'s at 57%-42% with 80% of precincts reporting, in \"the most bellwether county in the country,\" Vigo County, Indiana, which apparently <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/indiana_dems_taking_comfort_fr.php\">has only gone against the national result twice since 1892</a>. Make of it what you will. I'm opening my first beer, but not in a celebratory or commiseratory fashion -- anyway, I'm neutral and unbiased, right? -- but because... well, just because. </p> <p><strong>7.45pm</strong> Networks project <strong>McCain to win South Carolina</strong>. [Clarification: for the purposes of the running total, I'll count as called a state that's called by two of the main networks or by a main network and AP, and of course I'll keep you up to date with conflicting opinions, as with Fox on WV.]</p> <p><strong>Obama 3, McCain 16</strong></p> <p><strong>7.51pm</strong>: Some analysis of exit polls from Ohio and North Carolina, <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/11/north_carolina_and_ohio_exit_p.php\">courtesy of Marc Ambinder</a>: \"In Ohio -- more than 85% say they're worried about the economy; only 16% of Clinton voters are supporting McCain; The share of the black turnout is higher than in 2004; Obama's getting 98% of them. White men and white women are backing McCain -- but very narrowly -- only by three to four points in the exit polls. Obama lost non-college white males by nine points -- that's an improvement over John Kerry's performance.\"</p> <p><strong>8pm</strong>: Polls close in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, DC, Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Missouri. Pennsyvlania's the big question, of course, while Missouri is the other to watch. Stand by for a whole bunch of easy calls. </p> <p><strong>8.01pm</strong>: <strong>Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, DC called for Obama, Oklahoma and Tennessee to McCain. ME, which splits its votes, Obama 3 McCain 1 (CNN)</strong></p> <p>which makes it...</p> <p><strong>Obama 77 McCain 34</strong></p> <p>NBC calls Pennsylvania and New Hampshire for Obama, too, making it 103 - 34, and marking the failure of McCain's efforts to make Pennsylvania the centrepiece of his last-ditch campaigning in recent weeks. Oh, and now AP too:</p> <p><strong>Obama 103 McCain 34</strong> Obama takes Pennsylvania. Given the fact that we have essentially none of the precincts reporting, this is indicative of a very big win. </p> <p>And Alabama is too close to call? Wow.</p> <p><strong>8.13pm</strong>: In Phoenix, some Young People are singing a song, while wearing blazers. It's all very nice and very Republican. Joe Biden, meanwhile, has been elected senator for Delaware, which is going to be slightly awkward if he becomes vice-president too. Still, he has a fallback, I suppose. And Jeanne Shaheen, the former New Hampshire governor, seems to have won her race against the incumbent John Sununu, who was always incredibly vulnerable. </p> <p><strong>Senate Dem net gain +2</strong></p> <p><strong>8.22pm</strong>: Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=pennsylvania_goes_for_obama_al#110645\">has some exit polls</a> I haven't seen, projecting crazy wins for Obama in Florida, Ohio and Virginia. As he points out, they're probably wildly inflated, if remotely accurate at all...</p> <p><strong>8.25pm</strong>: Ah, <em>marvellous</em>: problems with voting in West Palm Beach, Florida, where absentee ballots, at any rate, appear to require voters to join two boxes together by drawing another box, which is more like a Mensa puzzle than a ballot paper. </p> <p><strong>8.30pm</strong>: Slightly late with this, sorry, but the networks are projecting that Elizabeth Dole, who spent the last part of her campaign accusing Democratic challenger Kay Hagan of being <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/atheist-baiter_dole_didnt_have.php\">on the side of the evil godless atheists</a>, has been seriously defeated in North Carolina.</p> <p>Polls are closing in Arkansas, which McCain's going to win. </p> <p><strong>8.35pm</strong>: Arkansas, Alabama for McCain...</p> <p><strong>Obama 103, McCain 49</strong></p> <p>...and hints that Georgia is about to go to McCain, too.</p> <p>OK, I'm <strong>moving to a new thread</strong>: please go <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\">here.</a></p>",
  "<p>Ban Ki-moon, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\">UN secretary-general</a>, is to travel to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congo\">Congo</a> in the coming days to press for an end to the \"catastrophic\" conflict in the east of the country as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/04/congo-nkunda\">the Tutsi rebel leader, Laurent Nkunda, threatened to attack Goma and then march across the country</a> after the government rejected direct peace negotiations. </p> <p>The UN today described the defence of Goma a \"red line\" and France called for the peacekeeping operation in eastern Congo to be strengthened with better troops and a stronger mandate.</p> <p>But UN peacekeepers could do no more than hide in their bases as heavy fighting between Nkunda's forces and Hutu rebels flared again around Rutshuru, the town north of Goma seized by the renegade Tutsi general last week, despite a ceasefire.</p> <p>The UN refugee agency said that it has found three of its camps near Rutshuru destroyed and empty, and that it is searching for the 50,000 people who were living in them. </p> <p>The Congolese administration today said it is only prepared to negotiate collectively with all rebel groups, which include Rwandan Hutu extremists and local militias. </p> <p>In response, Nkunda threatened to take his war all the way to the country's capital, Kinshasa.</p> <p>\"If they refuse to negotiate, it will mean they will be ready to only fight and we will fight them because we have to fight for our freedom,\" he told Reuters today.</p> <p>\"Goma is just a place to pass through ... When they force us to come down to Goma we won't stop there. People must be serious, otherwise there's no turning back.\" </p> <p>Militarily, all that stands between Nkunda and his seizure of Goma are several hundred UN peacekeepers after government troops fled the rebel advance. </p> <p>But an assault on the town would almost certainly draw a strong international reaction and create problems not only for Nkunda, but neighbouring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/rwanda\">Rwanda</a>, which is widely perceived as backing him. The UN says it witnessed Rwandan forces firing tank shells into Congo during the fighting last week. </p> <p>The head of UN peacekeeping, Alain Le Roy, said on a visit to Goma today that his forces would do all they can to defend the town from attack by the rebels who have halted their advance within sight of the outskirts.</p> <p>\"Our priority is Goma - to make sure Goma is a red line,\" he said.</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, called for the UN peacekeeping mission to be given more troops and a stronger mandate. He said the force, mostly made up of Indian soldiers in the eastern part of the country, needs \"more of an offensive capability\".</p> <p>\"We need different soldiers, and different rules of engagement,\" he said.</p> <p>But some diplomats say that what is needed is a greater political will by major powers to pressure Congo and Rwanda into ensuring existing peace agreements, which require the disarmament of Nkunda's forces as well as Hutu rebels and other groups, are upheld. </p> <p>Ban announced that he will travel to Congo, Rwanda and other regional capitals in an effort to bring an end to the conflict that has dragged on for more than a decade in one form or another and claimed millions of lives, mostly through the knock-on effects of war such as disease and hunger. </p> <p>\"The conflict along the Rwanda and Congolese border has gone on too long and (with) catastrophic consequences,\" said Ban.</p> <p>The UN chief <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/04/congo-obasanjo-african-union-rwanda\"> named the former Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo</a>, as his special envoy to the region.</p> <p>Ban's intervention comes as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africanunion\">African Union</a> prepares to call an urgent regional summit to confront the Congo crisis.</p> <p>The UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, today said it is trying to establish the whereabouts of tens of thousands of people forced from its camps by the fighting of recent weeks. </p> <p>\"Many have reportedly joined friends and relatives in nearby villages, while others have sought shelter in churches and public buildings,\" the UNHCR said. </p> <p>\"UNHCR staff reported that en route to Rutshuru they passed Kibumba, a makeshift site some 40km north of Goma. The team described the site as empty and destroyed, as if nothing had existed there before. The camp was a spontaneous site that housed at least 26,000 displaced persons, most of whom are now at Kibati camp north of Goma.\"</p> <p>Kibati is now home to about 65,000 people who have fled their homes in recent fighting, many of them sleeping in the open with no shelter from heavy rains. Aid agencies say they fear a cholera or typhoid outbreak.</p>",

  "<p>England have flown north to the rugby league hotbed of Newcastle for their last World Cup pool game against New Zealand on Saturday in desperate need of a lift. Jamie Jones-Buchanan may just be the man to provide it.</p> <p>The unsung Leeds forward, who is probably still best known for the huge beard he grew during the 2007 season even though he shaved it off for charity more than 12 months ago, is the obvious choice to pep up the pack that received a pummelling in Sunday's 52-4 defeat by Australia in Melbourne, even though it was in the backs where England were most blatantly second best.</p> <p>However, it is his engagingly positive attitude that could offer the most to a squad that has had little to smile about over the past couple of weeks. \"I'm an enthusiastic guy - sometimes too enthusiastic, some of the lads tell me,\" Jones-Buchanan said today after playing a game of British bulldog then signing a few dozen autographs at a windswept schools rugby league festival near the Newcastle Knights ground where the great Andrew Johns used to play, and where England will face the Kiwis. \"But that's me, how I like to live my life with a smile on my face. Whether I'm playing rugby or knocking around the hotel I might as well bring some energy up.\"</p> <p>He admits that smile disappeared for a few hours during and after the mauling at the Telstra Dome, which he watched from the stand with the other non-playing members of the squad. \"The Australians generally tend to look down on us a little bit and obviously as an Englishman you've got a lot of pride in your country whether you're playing in a game or supporting the lads as I was last week. So it affected me as much as anybody else. It's hard when some of the commentators and press are saying pretty demeaning things at times. It affects us all, not just the guys who played, so I'm smarting a little bit as well. But I'm sure we'll get another opportunity to play them in this competition.\"</p> <p>That will depend on the result of the semi-final in Brisbane on November 15, almost certainly against New Zealand. Theoretically this weekend's game is of far lesser importance, as only an unthinkable Papua New Guinea victory over Australia the following day could prevent both teams reaching the last four. But Jones-Buchanan agrees that after their efforts so far in the tournament England must improve.</p> <p>\"It's a massive game for us,\" added the 27-year-old, normally a second-row although he is likely to spend some of the match at prop after Maurie Fa'asavalu was ruled out with his hand injury. \"We've got to get our performance right and then obviously kick on in the semi, and I'm sure we'll do that.\"</p> <p>Jones-Buchanan's only previous Test appearance came as a substitute as Great Britain completed a 3-0 whitewash of the Kiwis in Wigan last autumn, a series that encouraged so much optimism about England's World Cup prospects. \"I enjoyed that, but that's the honeymoon over, you know, it's broken the ice. \"I think they probably will be a bit tougher [than last year] because it's a lot closer to home for their NRL lads, and it's us who have done the more travelling. But that's external to us, we've got to rise to the occasion ourselves. The flaw in this competition is if you just get through to the semi and win two games you've got the cup.\"</p> <p>Jon Wilkin has also been ruled out of the New Zealand game - although not for the rest of the tournament, the St Helens forward insisted yesterday, even though his face is still swollen after his cheekbone was damaged against Australia. England's coach, Tony Smith, who enjoyed the unusual experience of following his elder brother Brian on to the training field at Newcastle today after the former Hull and Bradford coach conducted the Knights' first pre-season session, also suggested that the unrelated Leeds wing Lee Smith will return after recovering from the foot injury he sustained against Papua New Guinea.</p> <p>The Kiwis, meanwhile, had a day off today which the majority of them chose to spend watching the Melbourne Cup in women's clothes.</p>",
  "<p>He may well inspire a dance that's worth 40m <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=LpocrqvP2Yg\">YouTube hits</a>, but that doesn't mean Soulja Boy Tell 'Em is an expert in race relations. At BET's Hip-Hop Awards wrap event last week, the 18-year-old Atlanta rapper shocked the crowd by coming out in favour of slavery. </p> <p>The shock statement came when BET correspondent and former Rolling Stone contributor, Tour\u00e9, asked various stars which historical figure they most hated. After Soulja Boy failed to give a response, Tour\u00e9 tried to prompt him, saying \"Others have said Hitler, bin Laden, the slave masters ... \" at which point Soulja Boy said: \"Oh wait! Hold up! Shout out to the slave masters! Without them we'd still be in Africa. We wouldn't be here to get this ice and tattoos.\"</p> <p>The stars were answering questions based on the Proust Questionnaire, a series of questions popularised by French writer Marcel Proust. An adapted version appears regularly in Vanity Fair magazine. </p> <p>\"I thought [the Proust Questionnaire] would be a way to get beyond image and into who they really are,\" wrote Tour\u00e9 on his <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-10-30/a-rapper-salutes-the-slave-trade/\">Daily Beast blog</a>. \"Most of the guys gave good, thoughtful, intelligent, sensitive answers.\"</p> <p>The rapper's fans have claimed Soulja Boy's youth as an excuse, although many bloggers have been more critical. As 4 Cryin Out Loud asks, \"How old was Ice Cube when he first emerged and was writing rhymes for Eazy - like 16?\"</p>",

  "<p>\"You are not moving. You are not metal!\" cried Trivium's singer. You could almost feel sorry for them. Supporting Slayer - and appeasing Slayer's diehard fans - is notoriously difficult at the best of times. As for supporting these veterans when they decide to play their 1986 masterpiece Reign in Blood in its entirety - well, any group would be on a hiding to nothing. Still, Trivium's MySpace-generation thrash kept younger members of the audience entertained while the more jaded headbangers grumbled at the bar, and the barrage of dry ice and strobe lights went a long way to disguising any self-doubt that might have struck the band.</p> <p>By contrast, Slayer's only concession to stagecraft was a gaudy computerised backdrop. If you've ever wondered what their scary, satanic skulls would look like viewed through the prism of Christmas bling, this was your chance. But this was never about the spectacle; it was about the songs. South of Heaven, Chemical Warfare, Necrophiliac - it was a set list most metal bands would kill for. (\"We had joy, we had fun, we had Seasons ... in the Abyss!\" teased frontman Tom Araya, before another oldie was blasted out.) Yet these were mere window-dressing for the main event. </p> <p>From Angel of Death to the closing Raining Blood, the only clue that this ferocious half-hour album dated back more than 20 years was how effortlessly it was played. Even with something as visceral and immediate as thrash metal, it takes time to get this good, and Slayer were nothing short of superb. With squealing guitars shredded to within an inch of their lives, and blood once again \"raining from a lacerated sky\", the apocalyptic finale thundered to a close. </p> <p>A shell-shocked crowd stood for a moment, then filed towards the exits. There was no encore. How could there be? What could possibly follow that?</p>",
  "<p>A worker is ignored by a colleague when they are not at their desks. Is it time to say something?</p> <h2>The problem</h2> <p>We work together almost every day, and I thought we got along really well. Our relationship is professional, but there's a bit of good-humoured banter in there too. But whenever I see this colleague of mine away from her desk - in the sandwich shop, on the bus, even in the corridor - she totally blanks me. Why is she snubbing me? I think it's really rude and it makes me worry that she hates me, or perhaps she thinks my work isn't up to scratch. </p> <h2>The worker's view</h2> <p>You need to stop being so self-obsessed. Unless you actually think that you are not a nice person or that you are indeed no good at your job.</p> <p>If someone snubbed me in this way, I would consider it rude on the face of it, but I have the confidence to assume it to be his or her problem. Maybe your colleague is painfully shy, and does not have a natural instinct to make eye contact, smile and say hello. And I wouldn't rule out a more practical problem, such as a problem with their eyesight.</p> <p>Your problem does beg the question: why haven't you asked the person what the problem is? You clearly have issues with communication and assertiveness too.<br><strong><em>Karen Devine, conduct manager</em></strong></p> <h2>The expert's view</h2> <p>She may be very shy outside the professional world and she might even be questioning whether you like her. Make an advance to turn her from a colleague into a friend: invite to drinks or for supper. If she isn't interested, you will know your relationship is professional rather than social.</p> <p>But you should never snub people in this way - the essence of manners is to treat other people as you would like to be treated yourself. So even if you are not at work, when you see a colleague you should say hello and smile. At least give a wave or a nod.</p> <p>There are things you can do to overcome shyness at work. Walk in with a smile in the morning and greet people by name. Even if they don't all respond, this way you have already broken the ice for the day and you get into a routine of friendliness. Remember that there are two body-language tricks to appearing confident: eye contact and a brisk, erect walk.</p> <p>If you struggle with this still, confide in someone else - one of the chattier people in your office - that you are shy. You don't want people to think you are aloof.<br><strong><em>Rachel Holland is the founder of <a href=\"http://www.rha-manners.co.uk\">Rachel Holland Associates</a></em></strong></p>",
  "<p>Twelve years ago, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/dolly/\">Dolly the Sheep</a> became the first mammal to be cloned from a living cell. Yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/nov/04/cloning-mice-frozen-mammoths\">scientists announced another first: the birth of cloned animals from frozen cells</a>. In this case, the clones were produced from mice that had been kept in the deep freeze for up to 16 years.</p> <p>At first glance it might seem a curious, if macabre, development. But the work by Japanese researchers at the <a href=\"http://www.riken.go.jp/engn/index.html\">RIKEN research centre in Yokohama</a> is important. It opens the door, if not fully, to \"resurrecting\" extinct species that many scientists thought were gone forever.</p> <p><a href=\"http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/tech/cloning/cloningrisks/\">Cloning is among the blackest of arts</a>. Unskilled technicians have a miserable success rate and even the best achieve only a minuscule number of live births for the number of attempts they make. It can so easily go wrong.</p> <p>And that is why the Japanese research, published in <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, is so interesting. Most scientists thought that cloning would not work with frozen cells, because as ice crystals grow in the cells, they rupture cell walls and generally damage the delicate structures inside. </p> <p>What Sayaka Wakayama and colleagues have showed is that even when cells have been damaged by ice crystals, it is sometimes possible to find intact nuclei - which contain the cell's DNA - which can be used to create healthy clones. The nucleus is simply transferred to an empty mouse egg to fertilise it.</p> <p>The Japanese team created four clones. One died of breathing difficulties shortly after birth, another was cannibalised by its foster mother. The other two grew to adulthood and are seemingly healthy.</p> <p>So how could the technique be used? Some of the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1082776/Cloning-grave-Scientists-create-new-life-mouse-frozen-16-YEARS.html\">more fanciful media reports</a> suggest it will usher in an age when it is commonplace for people to have their brains plunged into a deep freeze upon death in the hope that someone might want to clone them later on. That would be a very odd thing. The clone would of course look very similar, and might even have some familiar behavioural traits, but in every other sense it would be just another human being, shaped by a different environment and experiences. We will probably have enough people in the future to rule out any deep desire to bring back anyone who hoped to live on in the deep freeze.</p> <p>But this research might be relevant to humans in other ways. Perhaps cells from major organs could be frozen while we're still young and cloned in old age to make healthy tissues to replace damaged or diseased parts. </p> <p>In the medium term, though, the research will mostly excite scientists who are trying to bring species back from extinction. <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/blog/shortsharpscience/2007/07/baby-mammoth-discovery.html\">Remains of woolly mammoths</a> have been uncovered in the Russian permafrost and these may contain intact cells that could be used to create a clone. Perhaps the sabre-toothed tiger could also be resurrected? </p> <p>Serious hurdles remain, however. To create a cloned embryo you need a surrogate egg for the DNA and then a surrogate mother to carry it to term, but where do you find a female if a species is extinct? One option with the mammoth may be to create a hybrid by injecting the mammoth DNA into an elephant egg. Whether the embryo would survive until birth is a question scientists are keen to answer.</p> <p>Despite the difficulties ahead, there is reason to be hopeful. The Japanese scientists have already overcome one major hurdle, giving fresh impetus to others in the field. With effort, scientists could use this controversial technology to change the face of life on Earth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday November 5 2008. We said the clones were produced from mice that had been frozen for 16 months, rather than 16 years. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The Legal Services Commission (LSC) is the government body responsible for providing legal representation to people who cannot afford to pay for it themselves. It currently employs around 1,700 staff in its London headquarters, 12 regional offices in England and one office in Wales, and provides legal aid to more than two million people each year. </p> <p>Part of the Ministry of Justice, the LSC provides two services; one for people bringing civil cases, such as family law, housing and immigration matters, and another for defendants in criminal cases. </p> <p>The LSC has been under intense financial pressure in recent months. Following a review of the legal aid system by Lord Carter in 2006, it began moving towards a \"market-based system\" that involved stringent budget cuts. The LSC has been stating repeatedly since 2006 that its spending levels were unsustainable and that \"fundamental reform\" would be necessary if the organisation were to cope with its role of delivering legal aid in future. </p> <p>One of the most controversial areas of reform has been a system of fixed and graduated fees for lawyers doing legal aid work. There were fears earlier this year that proposed fee cuts for barristers, which caused criminal barristers to strike, would put high-profile cases such as the Rhys Jones trial in jeopardy. The government last month retreated on those proposals, raising fees again by 5%.</p>",

  "<h2>First blood to Obama</h2> <p>And so here we are. In accordance with tradition, voting opened at midnight eastern time, or 5am UK time, in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire today, and closed moments later, after the village's residents had gathered to cast their ballots in the ballroom of a local hotel. They voted overwhelmingly for Obama - by 15 votes to six. </p> <p>By the time the rest of America has voted, election officials expect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama2\">the biggest turnout in the nation's history</a> -130-140 million voters, compared with 121 million in 2004, Ewen MacAskill writes in the Guardian today, bringing this gripping and unprecedented campaign to a close at last. Obama is well ahead in all the major polls, and there seems little doubt he will gain the 270 electoral college votes required to win. The question more frequently asked is whether he'll win by a landslide.</p> <p>The Democrats also seem on track to gain seven or eight more seats in the Senate, where they already hold 51 - a victory that could make governing effectively far easier for Obama than for some of his predecessors. Whatever happens tonight, the election campaign \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/us/politics/04memo.html\">has rewritten the rules</a> on how to reach voters, raise money, organize supporters, manage the news media, track and mould public opinion, and wage - and withstand - political attacks,\" writes Adam Nagourney in the New York Times The day brought sadness for Obama, though, in the midst of his rising confidence. His paternal grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, who raised him from the age of 10, died of cancer in Honolulu, a day before the nation voted on her grandson's candidacy. </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>A light day of campaigning.

Each state has a fixed number of votes based on its population size.</em></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> The Democratic candidate's poll lead in several of the states George Bush won in 2004 gives him greater opportunities to reach this figure. A win in Virginia, where polls close at midnight GMT, would suggest Obama is on course for victory in some previously Republican states. A win in two of the big three swing states of past election cycles \u2013 Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2013 would all but guarantee him the White House.</p> <p><strong>McCain:</strong> The Republican candidate's route to the Oval Office is much narrower. Among the states Bush won in 2004, at least six are leaning towards Obama and several others are toss-ups. In addition to the safe Republican states, McCain's most likely victory will come if he can hold Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and Missouri, and take Pennsylvania or some combination of New Hampshire, Iowa, New Mexico and Colorado.</p> <p>Regardless of when one candidate reaches the magic 270 electoral votes needed to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uselections2008\">win the presidency</a>, the night contains enough subplots and intrigues to keep insomniac politicos occupied late into the night.</p> <h2>11pm GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong>Kentucky</strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/indiana\">Indiana</a></strong>. </p> <p>Kentucky is sure to hand McCain its eight electoral votes, but Obama has surged in the polls in Indiana (11 electoral votes) and threatens to be the first Democrat to win the state since Lyndon Johnson's landslide defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964. If Obama can overcome Indiana's deep-seated conservatism, it indicates that economic concerns have outweighed cultural ones and Obama can expect a landslide victory.</p> <h2>Midnight GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/florida\">Florida</a></strong>, <strong>Georgia</strong>, <strong>New Hampshire</strong>, <strong>South Carolina</strong>, <strong>Vermont</strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/virginia\">Virginia</a></strong>.</p> <p>Florida (27 electoral votes) was the site of the 2000 voting-counting fiasco in which the supreme court gave the state \u2013 and therefore the election \u2013 to Bush. It is a must-win for McCain but last-minute legal tussles and discrepancies in the voter rolls may delay results. </p> <p>McCain remains popular among Florida's military voters and the culturally conservative north of the state. Obama did not campaign here in the Democratic primary race, but nevertheless pulled ahead of McCain in mid-September when the US economy began tanking in earnest.</p> <p>Georgia (15 electoral votes) is a usually staunch Republican state but threatened by Obama in this election. Propelled by unprecedented enthusiasm among the state's black voters, Obama has pulled within striking distance. An Obama victory here would upend 40 years of conventional thinking about race in southern politics. Virginia (13 electoral votes), another state once part of the slave-owning confederacy, has not backed a Democrat since 1964, but demographic changes, especially in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC, have given Obama an advantage.</p> <p>South Carolina (eight electoral votes) is safe for McCain and Vermont (three electoral votes) will back Obama. New Hampshire voters have a long-held fondness for McCain \u2013 he won the state's Republican primary in 2000 and this year \u2013 but Obama made a surge in the polls mid-September and is likely to capture the state's four electoral votes.</p> <h2>12.30am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ohio\">Ohio</a></strong> and <strong>West Virginia</strong>.</p> <p>If Obama wins Ohio (20 electoral votes) he has the election, but even if he takes only North Carolina (15 electoral votes), McCain's options are seriously limited. Both are toss-up states where Obama maintained a slight lead in polling going into election day. West Virginia (five electoral votes) will go to McCain. </p> <p>(One hurdle to a decisive result: Ohio has been the scene of bitter partisan legal wrangling over the voting process. If election officials, Democrats and Republicans can agree who is eligible to vote, where voting machines should be allocated, and which votes should be counted, expect a smooth night. <br>If the campaigns call out the lawyers, we may not see decisive results from Ohio tonight.)</p> <h2>1am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in 18 states (plus Washington, DC) awarding a total of 205 electoral votes. </p> <p><strong>Connecticut</strong>, <strong>Delaware</strong>, <strong>Illinois</strong>, <strong>Maine</strong>, <strong>Maryland</strong>, <strong>Massachusetts</strong>, <strong>Michigan</strong>, <strong>New Jersey</strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a></strong> and <strong>Washington, DC</strong> will likely go to Obama, giving him 113 electoral votes. </p> <p><strong>Alabama</strong>, <strong>Kansas</strong>, <strong>Mississippi</strong>, <strong>Nebraska</strong>, <strong>Oklahoma</strong>, <strong>South Dakota</strong>, <strong>Tennessee</strong> and <strong>Texas</strong> should give McCain their combined 81 electoral votes.</p> <p><strong>Missouri</strong> could go either way. Bush won the state twice \u2013 but so did Bill Clinton. If Obama wins the state's 11 electoral votes, he can start popping champagne corks.</p> <h2>1.30am GMT</h2> <p><strong>Arkansas</strong> will send its six electoral votes to McCain. Clinton's home state voted for him twice but Democratic candidates since then - Al Gore, John Kerry and now Obama - have been a poor fit with the state's rural and socially conservative mould.</p> <h2>2am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/minnesota\">Minnesota</a></strong>, <strong>New York</strong>, <strong>Rhode Island</strong>, <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/colorado\">Colorado</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newmexico\">New Mexico</a></strong>, <strong>Wyoming</strong>, <strong>Louisiana</strong> and <strong>Arizona</strong>.</p> <p>Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island and Wisconsin should go to Obama, handing him 55 electoral votes. Colorado and New Mexico are leaning towards Obama, and he could pick up these two from the Republicans, for an additional 14 votes. Wyoming and Louisiana should give McCain another 12, although Obama has made late polling gains in Louisiana (nine electoral votes), which has one of the largest African American populations in the country.</p> <p>Last week polls showed Obama gaining swiftly in Arizona, McCain's home state. If Obama takes Arizona's 10 electoral votes, McCain may want to leave politics for good. (The scenario occurred in 2000, when Gore lost Tennessee to Bush.)</p> <h2>3am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong>Idaho</strong>, <strong>Montana</strong>, <strong>Utah</strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iowa\">Iowa</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nevada\">Nevada</a></strong> and <strong>North Dakota</strong>.</p> <p>Idaho, Montana and Utah will send McCain 12 more electoral votes. Iowa should vote for Obama, giving him seven electoral votes. Obama could also take Nevada from the Republicans, for five more electoral votes. North Dakota (three electoral votes) has not voted for a Democrat since 1964, but if Obama is having a very good night he may take this too.</p> <h2>4am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong>California</strong>, <strong>Hawaii</strong>, <strong>Oregon</strong> and <strong>Washington</strong>.</p> <p>If you're still up at this hour, you may watch the states above send their combined 77 votes for Obama, possibly putting him over the 270 needed to win the election. </p> <h2>5am GMT</h2> <p>Polls close in <strong>Alaska</strong>.</p> <h2>How it works</h2> <p>Television stations and the Associated Press, America's leading news agency, are under tremendous pressure to call the results early. They base their predictions on incoming vote tallies, divining the results from precinct-by-precinct results, plus exit polling, and identifying trends where possible. The model works in states where one candidate wins by a sizeable margin, but in close races news organisations must wait until most of the precinct totals are in. Sometimes this can take a while.</p> <p>News junkies will be watching to see which news network calls the election first. The television networks face a dilemma \u2013 they want to declare a winner early but have memories of the disputed Florida vote of 2000 and are fearful of calling it wrong. No editor or news executive wants a replay of the 1948 election, which ended with Harry Truman holding a copy of the Chicago Tribune that bore the banner headline \"Dewey Defeats Truman\".</p>",
  "<p>As America goes to the polls, Guardian America editor <strong>Michael Tomasky</strong> looks back at a momentous campaign, and explains which states to watch for tonight as the results are announced.</p> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee meet tomorrow to discuss a big cut in the cost of borrowing. Economics correspondent <strong>Ashley Seager</strong> explains why some banks are reluctant to pass on an interest rate cut from the Bank of England.</p> <p>Education editor <strong>Polly Curtis</strong> looks at the schools adjudicator's report into admissions compliance, which reveals widespread flouting of the rules, particularly by faith schools.</p> <p>ITV chief <strong>Michael Grade</strong> has called for a crackdown on foul language after the 9pm watershed on television, reports <strong>Matt Wells</strong>, presenter of our Media Talk podcast. </p> <p>Oxfam aid worker <strong>Rebecca Wynn</strong> describes the refugee crisis on the border of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p> <p>And <strong>Martin Wainwright</strong> canvasses the opinion of black youngsters in Leeds on the possibility of Barack Obama being elected president of the United States.</p>",
  "<p>Canvassing for Obama in the Florida Keys: Conch Harbour, Pecan Lane, Rose Lane, Hurricane Alley \u2013 every street I canvass I get the same story. For instance: I ask for James \"Two Star\" Scott, a name on the list of registered voters given to me by the Obama campaign office. And I am told: \"He comes and goes.\" Finally out of exasperation I ask: \"Comes and goes! What do you mean he comes and goes?\"</p> <p>Turns out that all these guys are boat captains who come and go: to Bermuda, Bahama, Key Largo. I am in Key West and the references are all Caribbean. I am 80 miles from Havana and 124 miles from mainland America. To get here we drove over miles of ocean linked by Keys, the spectacular archipelago of islands off southern Florida: Sugarloaf Key, Duck Key, No Name Key, where anti-Cuban guerrillas trained in the 60s.</p> <p>The pace for volunteers here isn't as hectic as in the mainland offices but there is a sense of urgency. We are told that we need to deliver the Keys for Obama in order to balance the Republican vote in the northern I-4 corridor of Florida that stretches from Tampa to Orlando.</p> <p>Hence the days spent walking up and down the island to ensure every registered Democrat votes. Fifty per cent have already done so under the early voting scheme and the numbers so far are favouring Obama approximately 60-40 in the Upper Keys; in the Lower Keys it is reversed to McCain 60-40. The scales could tip either way. </p> <p>Part of the reason Florida is in play at all is because of the campaign's tremendous field-based effort to build voter lists through the \"Votebuilder\" data-bank, and because of the Democratic national committee's <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/a/party/a_50_state_strategy/\">50-state strategy</a> under Howard Dean's leadership. In addition to the GOTV effort, the Obama campaign is taking no chances on election day: lawyers are being sent to every polling station to make sure there are no dirty tricks this time around.</p> <p>Though in Key West, the <a href=\"http://www.keysnet.com/news/story/29904.html\">hanky panky</a> seems to be of a different sort. The Sheriff has just been outed for doing \"nooners\" with his secretary; someone running for a district Mosquito Board turns out to have been <a href=\"http://www.kwtn-blue.com/2008/10/jailed-bug-board.html\">a porn star</a>; constitutional amendment No 2 takes away healthcare benefits and other protections for unmarried partners but has been misleadingly worded as the \"Florida Marriage Protection\" amendment.</p> <p>The reason any of this is relevant is because all these issues are on the ballot list, where in the Keys, in addition to picking the president, you also get to voice your opinion on eight constitutional amendments and on candidates running for everything from the Mosquito Board to sheriff, circuit judge to Congress.</p> <p>I am not having much luck with my list of voters. The next one I meet tells me that he can't vote because he has a felony for laying out crab traps. I think he must be pulling my leg, so I ring up the Obama office to check. Turns out that in Florida even once you have served your time you have to apply to the governor to have your rights reinstated. Without that permission you can't vote, among other things.</p> <p>There seem to be quite a few people just out of prison here. Along with a vibrant gay community, Cubans, Jews, a lot of retirees, an old Bahamanian community of blacks and whites who have been here for over 150 years, and other \"conchs\" (islanders who have been here here for generations).</p> <p>In the midst of my canvassing, I naughtily sneak in a 20-minute break to check out the 19th century house of one such conch, <a href=\"http://www.heritagehousemuseum.org/html/jessie.htm\">Miss Jessie Porter</a>, famous for her dinner parties with guests such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallulah_Bankhead\">Tallulah Bankhead</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc9.htm\">Tennessee Williams</a>, <a href=\"http://www.timelesshemingway.com/faq/faq1.shtml#briefbio\">Ernest Hemingway</a> and Robert Frost. Key West is a great place to relax. The streets are lined with palms, banyans, bougainvilleas and hibiscus, the clapboard houses have southern-colonial style wrap-around lace porches, elaborate confections in pastel pinks, violets and pistachios. Laid back during the day and a carnivale atmosphere in the evenings, pina coladas and Key Lime pies.</p> <p>We are very spoilt volunteers. An Obama supporter who owns a hotel, appropriately named Eden House, is putting us up. In this Floridian Art Deco hotel from the 1920s, we have a hammock outside our room, a book on Buddhism on our bedside table, palm trees and an azure sky to admire. People see us with our Obama signs and beckon us into their shops to chat about politics. Mr Johnson of the Johnson Grocery Store, a Bahamanian in his 50s whose family has been here for generations, gives me a postcard on which he writes: \"Nur, god bless you.\" On Duval Street, a teenager who is too young to vote and is working at an ice cream parlour gives me a vanilla custard ice-cream in support of Obama.</p> <p>What will we do once the election is over? It has been a gift outright to see America in this way. These words are in my mind, as I have just read <a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-gift-outright/\">The Gift Outright</a>, the poem that Robert Frost wrote at Miss Jessie's house and recited at John F Kennedy's inauguration. Now, so as not to end on some soppy note, back to knocking doors for Obama.</p>",

  "<p>Most people will be too carried away by the relentless action in the latest Bond film to notice the background, but design-minded viewers will find it more exciting than most. It's unlikely to go down as the best Bond ever, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\">Quantum of Solace</a> wins hands down when it comes to best architecture. </p> <p>Perhaps it's because he's Swiss, but director Marc Forster certainly has an eye for a good building, usually a piece of hard-edged European modernism with a conveniently flat roof. A key location, for example, is the <a href=\"http://www.truevenue.com/en/locations/detail.php?id=973\"> Festival House Bregenz</a>, in Austria - a dauntingly sophisticated ensemble of steel cladding and huge glass windows that opens out on to a spectacular open-air amphitheatre facing the lake, with the stage in the middle of the water. Designed by Austrian architect <a href=\"http://www.dietrich.untertrifaller.com/project.php?id=161&amp;type=KULTUR&amp;lang=en\"> Dietrich Untertrifaller</a>, it's the perfect venue for a covert mid-opera meeting of arch-villains. It's also great for crane shots, tuxedo-clad shootouts, and the odd rooftop punch-up. Forster seems to have passed up on another local landmark, mind you: the <a href=\"http://www.kunsthaus-bregenz.at\"> Kunsthaus Bregenz</a>, designed by his revered compatriot Peter Zumthor. Perhaps it just didn't have enough places to plug in a Klieg light. </p> <p>Elsewhere we get a precarious chase over the terracotta tiled roofscape of Siena, a brief tour of London's Barbican, some grand colonial buildings in Panama, even a car chase through Italy's Carrara marble quarry - birthplace of Rome's Pantheon, among others. Topping the bill, though, is the <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/bond/Residencia.html\"> ESO Paranal Residencia</a> in Chile, where the traditional climactic rendezvous between Bond and his nemesis takes place. In reality, this stunning building is a hostel for astronomers at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere. Designed by German architects Auer and Weber it's a fine choice: a long rectangular strip of a building, sunk into the barren landscape that contains a splendid indoor garden and swimming pool lit by a 35-metre glass dome. Being situated in the middle of the Atacama desert, 2,400 metres above sea level, it's a place very few of us are likely to ever see inside for real, so here's your chance. Be dazzled by the rhythmic concrete facades! Thrill to the earth-toned interiors! Swoon over the long internal perspectives. Salivate over the minimal detailing! Then watch it all get blown to smithereens!</p> <p>Yes, almost inevitably, the building does not survive its encounter with Bond, and as he saunters away from its smoking ruins, it occurred to me that few buildings ever do. Bond movies invariably end like Quantum: with 007 single-handedly trashing not only the plans of would-be world dominators but also their hideouts, which is a pity because most of them are rather splendid. Think of the stupendous submersible lair of Stromberg in the Spy Who Loved Me with its circular underwater windows and 2001-style furniture, the hollowed-out volcano in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/\">You Only Live Twice</a>, the vertiginous control room in Moonraker, the elegant, if structurally unfeasible, ice palace in Die Another Day, and so forth. Some of the low-rent Bond baddies settle for oil rigs and such, but whatever the villain's crib of choice, you can guarantee it's going to get exploded. Those villains tend to put a great deal of effort into their bachelor pads, recruiting tasteful but evil architects, contractors, interior designers etc - it can't be easy. Then along comes Bond. The villains are the creators; Bond is the destroyer. He's basically an enemy of architecture. </p> <p>Even beyond the villains' lairs, Bond is a menace to the built environment. Think back to Casino Royale. For once there was no hideout at the end, so what does Bond do? He demolishes a priceless Venetian palazzo instead, not just smashing it up but actually sinking it into the lagoon. That seemed like an awful lot of damage to inflict in the name of a $150m theft, or whatever it was. How much would it cost to repair that building? Probably more. It's a similar story when it comes to historic cityscapes in Quantum of Solace. The chase across the rooftops of Siena leaves plenty of tiles in need of replacement, and culminates in Bond and his quarry crashing through a skylight, swinging about on pulleys and knocking over statues inside some antiquated chamber. </p> <p>If Bond has a problem with architecture it can probably be traced back to his creator, Ian Fleming, who was certainly no fan of modernism. He even went as far as to name one of his best baddies after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jun/03/film.hayfestival2005\"> Erno Goldfinger</a>, architect of London's Trellick Tower among others. Goldfinger the architect was apparently a neighbour of Fleming's in Hampstead, and the conservation-minded author was incensed when he demolished two Victorian houses to build his now-classic modern villas on <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-2willowroad\">Willow Road</a>. So he returned the insult by lending Goldfinger's name to his fictional gold-loving megalomaniac. Another, less-controversial version of the story has it that Fleming played golf with Goldfinger's wife's cousin, but either way, poor Erno tried and failed to stop Fleming appropriating his name, and had to bear the association for the rest of his life.</p> <p>Fleming's views on Le Corbusier were equally scathing, according to associates. In fact, on closer inspection, what is the archetypal Bond villain if not a modern architect? He is usually on a mission to \"improve\" humanity by wiping out the messy status quo and replacing it with some orderly, rational utopia of his own design. In Moonraker it's Hugo Drax who wants to start civilisation afresh in space. In the Spy Who Loved Me, it's Stromberg, who tries to wipe out the world's cities and create his own underwater world of Atlantis. \"The only hope for the future of mankind,\" he says, echoing Le Corbusier. \"We all have our dreams,\" responds Bond, resolving to ensure Stromberg's scorched-earth vision remains just that - a dream.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339281535\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/gallery/2008/11/03/elrod1.jpg\" alt=\"James Bond: Elrod House which was featured in Diamonds Are Forever.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The archetypal villain interior ... Elrod House, which was featured in Diamonds Are Forever. Photograph: Alan Weintraub/Arcaid/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The association between evil and modernism runs through many Bond movies. In Diamonds Are Forever, Sean Connery is taught a lesson by Bambi and Thumper in John Lautner's beautiful Elrod House in Palm Springs - all futuristic concrete domes, dynamic diagonals and circular furniture. Villain interiors are often modelled on similar modernists. <a href=\"http://www.jamesbondwiki.com/page/Osato's+Office?t=anon\">Osato's spacious office</a> in You Only Live Twice is rather Corbusier in Japan. Goldfinger's \"rumpus room\" is distinctly Frank Lloyd Wright, as is Hugo Drax's behind-the-waterfall lair in Moonraker, whose Mayan-patterned relief panels resemble those of <a href=\"http://www.ennishouse.org/\"> Wright's Ennis House</a>. The association continues in Quantum of Solace. When they find a mole within MI6, where do you think he lives? London's Barbican centre, of course. What kind of house does Bond himself live in, I wonder? Does he even have one?</p> <p>If Bond is the scourge of modern architecture, the movies at least have a champion in the form of Ken Adam, production designer extraordinaire. He was the man behind most of the classic Bond villain headquarters - from Dr No to Moonraker, and he designed and furnished them with great skill and devotion, as a <a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500514146.mxs?5fe86a50875617acbcdaad9d1d171810&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\"> new book from Thames and Hudson</a> details. Adam studied architecture in London before the second world war, and he deserves to be considered one. Inarguably, he created some of the most memorable spaces of the modern era. Usually, we look at buildings in a city and wonder what they look like inside. Adam's spectacular interiors do the opposite, inviting us to wonder what the buildings look like on the outside. In reality of course, most of them were just flimsy sets in Pinewood studios whose ultimate fate was to be dismantled or blown up (like the Venetian palazzo in Casino Royale, and the interior of the Paranal Residencia in Quantum of Solace), but Adam's designs have been as influential as any \"real\" pieces of architecture.</p> <p>Bond might deploy his licence to trash with worrying abandon, but his motive should be seen less as a grudge against modern architecture and more an extreme form of criticism. He makes a mockery of buildings' functions and pricks the pomposity of their designers. Flat rooftops become platforms from which to dangle henchmen by their neckties; tall chimneys are there to drop wheelchair-bound villains down; corridors become racetracks, balconies vantage points, buildings as a whole turned into giant climbing frames, their carefully designed details relegated to mere footholds and escape routes. Perhaps that's just fanciful thinking on the part of someone who writes about architecture for a living, but as I loosen my bowtie, unholster my revolver and mix a stiff vodka martini, I can't help but identify with him.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Name your three desert island must-have ingredients</strong></p> <p><strong>Harry Parr</strong>: Leaf gelatine, so that we could turn anything on the island into jelly - from coconuts to pineapples.

We've been using this amazing gin called <a href=\"http://www.bulldoggin.com/\">Bulldog</a> which has something called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longan\">dragon eye</a> in it. And gaffer tape, because it's surprisingly useful in cooking. We like to create a total impression and gaffer tape is needed for that.</p> <p><strong>Harry Parr</strong>: I used it to make an Egyptian escalator in my house.</p> <p><strong>What would you have for your last supper? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Ooh, we know this one - it's a meat snowman. You know how you can get three-bird roasts? Well, what if you got a twelve-bird roast and then on top you put an eight-bird roast and then for the head a three-bird roast? And you could give it facial features as well. We've actually got ambitions to make one for Christmas. [B&amp;P proceed to lengthily discuss how they would cook the meat snowman.]</p> <p><strong>What foodstuff would you put in Room 101? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Harry you're quite passionate about this \u2026</p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: Coriander.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Well, what's wrong with it?</p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: It's unpleasant.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite table? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: I would say ours because there's probably nothing comparable to it in terms of sheer exuberance. </p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: We like the <a href=\"http://www.thehawksmoor.co.uk/drink.htm\">Hawksmoor</a>. They do these amazing huge fishbowls of cocktails that are all stacked up ready for drinking. </p> <p><strong>What's your poison? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Spirits and whisky.</p> <p><strong>Which book gets you cooking? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: In truth, Hunter S Thompson's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Loathing-Harper-Perennial-Modern-Classics/dp/0007204493\">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas </a>- he doesn't actually eat much but the sheer consumption in it, the vivid picture of excess that Hunter S Thompson paints, makes me want to get creative.</p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Food-Processing-Technology-Principles-Publishing/dp/1855735334\">Food Processing Technology</a>.

He's the husband of Ruth Rogers. And we'd have to have some babes - maybe the Pussy Cat Dolls. They probably wouldn't eat much. Maybe we should have Girls Aloud?</p> <p><strong>What was your childhood teatime treat? </strong></p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: The foot-long fishfingers at Little Chef.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: I can't compete with that.</p> <p><strong>What would you cook to impress a date? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: We're working on this, actually - we want to do something on food that induces a 'state of being'. So if you could choreograph a meal, we'd have something to begin with that lifts everyone into a state of lively conviviality: maybe a foam, definitely something light and spicy. Then for the main course we'd move onto the aphrodisiacs - I've heard banana works well but I don't know about having it as a main, maybe we could use coffee or chocolate. </p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: We could have something more obvious like oysters or asparagus, too. </p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Then our final course would have a soporific effect - so the date couldn't get away. Maybe a turkey and lettuce jelly ...</p> <p><strong>Who would you most like to cook for? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: John Prescott. We want to create a Roman banquet for him complete with a vomitorium. </p> <p><strong>What was your most memorable meal? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: I was seven years old and we were visiting the US. I was taken to a place called Medieval Times. It was a formative experience. There was jousting and you ate with your hands. Even though I was cheering for the green knight and he failed to win the hand of the fair maiden, I saw the future and it was food. And they called the female waiting staff 'wenches'.</p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: At P\u00e9trus.</p> <p><strong>What was your biggest food disaster? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: We held an event a couple of weeks ago which 60 people had paid to attend, and we wanted a smoky effect. We were pumping out smoke and we set off the fire alarms. Unfortunately, they weren't linked to the fire brigade and no one could figure out how to turn then off. In a mad panic we went round and undid every single one and took out the batteries. Then the next day we had to go and put them all back again. It was quite irritating.</p> <p><strong>What's the worst meal you've ever had? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Two Saturdays ago we had been working very, very hard and we decided to give ourselves a break and go out for dinner. We were walking along the Thames Embankment and saw a place called Ned's Noodles which had fabulous graphics showing the culinary delights which awaited us. Unfortunately, the food was totally inedible. It was turgid, congealed, grot - we ordered five different variations of noodle and each one tasted exactly the same.</p> <p><strong>What's the most outlandish thing you've ever eaten? </strong></p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: A gilded sausage. Sam won it in a hot dog-eating contest.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Zebra jelly. It had the flavour of zebra meat, with cream and blackcurrant used to make the black-and-white stripes. </p> <p><strong>Who's your food hero/food villain? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: My food hero is Antonin Car\u00eame [said to be the creator of haute cuisine, Car\u00eame cooked for Napoleon, George IV, Tsar Alexander I and Baron Rothschild] - he was the king of chefs.</p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: Our villain ... shall we say it, Sam? Yes, let's piss off [the TV company] Optomen. Our villain is Valentine Warner. He seems like a perfectly nice chap but really, what is the point of him? Hugh's been telling people to eat seasonally and locally for ages.</p> <p><strong>Nigella or Delia? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Nigella for me, she's hot.</p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: Delia.</p> <p><strong>Vegetarians: genius or madness? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Madness! Totally rubbish! Why would you deny yourself something so delicious? </p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: AND they can't eat our jelly.</p> <p><strong>Muesli or fry-up? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Fry-up, although we could make the muesli into a sort of hash brown and fry it.</p> <p><strong>Starter or pudding? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Both. But we like the expressiveness of pudding and the fact that it can be much more impressive. Like flaming puddings for instance - you can't do that to a starter. We like pudding theatre.</p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: Three courses actually isn't enough. I think we should have more, we should have dinner <em>\u00e0 la Fran\u00e7ais</em>: several courses on the table all at once.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: We do like banquets.</p> <p><strong>What's the best/worst thing about the British food scene? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: The best thing is how we manage to mix high-end and low-end cuisine so well. Our takeaways and our haute cuisine are both great. The worst is probably the guilt that people associate with food - we have such a small-minded, nasty attitude to eating. For example, I find that people will metaphorically smack their own wrists and then go and eat the 'naughty' choccy bar. It's horrible. We think everyone should eat more and just enjoy themselves.<br> <strong>What's the next big thing? </strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Figurative food: food that's in the shape of something else [B&amp;P make jelly moulds that are scale models of famous buildings]. We've read about a food mountain in the 1800s that was almost life-size and had children dressed as raggedy shepherd boys coming out of caves within it and singing to people as they ate bits. We'd like to have a go at that and maybe float it down the Thames. There would be health and safety issues with using children in the food mountain, though. Anyway, it's basically another way to engage people and introduce them to new flavours and sensations.<br> <strong>What would you do if you weren't architectural foodsmiths? </strong></p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: I'd be an inventor who made up ridiculous problems that don't need solving.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: I'd have liked to work on a super tanker. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax\">Panamax</a> one.</p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: What's a Panamax? Have you just made that up?</p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: No, they were made purely to fit down the Panama Canal with a foot spare on either side. They're massive. I'd spend my time running laps of the deck.</p> <p><strong>Make a wish</strong></p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: I wish that there was an alcohol fountain in London.</p> <p><strong>HP</strong>: I wish that people ate as much as they did in the 19th century.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong>: Yes, and I wish for more eating competitions in the UK.</p> <p>\u2022 Sam Bompas and Harry Parr together are <a href=\"http://www.jellymongers.co.uk/about.html\">Bompass and Parr</a>, architectural foodsmiths.

  "<p>Healthy mice have been cloned for the first time from dead mice that had been frozen for several years, raising the possibility, scientists say, of \"resurrecting\" extinct animals such as mammoths from their frozen carcasses. </p> <p>The clones were produced from dead mice kept at -20C for up to 16 years by a group of scientists in Kobe, Japan. After thawing the mice, researchers collected nuclei from cells in their brain tissue. These were then injected into empty eggs from which the DNA had been removed, to create cloned embryos. A second round of cloning used stem cells from the embryos that grew into four mouse clones. </p> <p>Nine further clones were created by mixing the cells of different embryos, according to research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. </p> <p>So-called \"Dolly the sheep\"-style cloning has previously been achieved using live donor cells from which DNA was transferred to eggs. Cloning from thawed frozen cells was thought to be difficult because ice crystals formed in frozen cells could damage the DNA, making cloning of long-dead animals impossible.</p> <p>The scientists, led by Dr Teruhiko Wakayama from the Centre for Developmental Biology in Kobe, wrote: \"We have demonstrated here that healthy cloned mice and chimeric clonal mice could be obtained by nuclear transfer using donor nuclei from cells obtained from bodies frozen without cryoprotectants for up to 16 years.\" </p> <p>Other sources of frozen nuclei, such as white blood cells, could be as useful for cloning as brain tissue, said the scientists. </p> <p>The research raises hopes that the cloning technique could be used to resurrect extinct animals frozen in permafrost, such as the woolly mammoth, Wakayama told New Scientist magazine. </p> <p>\"It would be very difficult, but our work suggests it is no longer science fiction,\" he said.</p>",
  "<h2>Healthcare</h2> <p>Barack Obama would require companies to cover all Americans regardless of their health. For those who do not receive coverage from their employers, he would create a registry of private health insurance plans and offer coverage through the government. Employers would be required either to provide health insurance or pay into a pool to support the national plan. He would subsidise coverage for low-income Americans.</p> <p>John McCain's plan would encourage Americans to purchase their own insurance coverage rather than get it from their employers. He would offer a tax credit to individuals who do so, but would tax the value of employee health benefits. He would allow people to purchase health insurance plans from any state in the country, pre-empting state-level coverage regulations.</p> <h2>Taxes</h2> <p>Obama would allow President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy to expire but would cut taxes for low- and moderate-income Americans and senior citizens. He would also increase some payroll taxes for Americans who make more than $200,000 per year (or $250,000 for married couples), and increase the maximum tax rate on capital gains.</p> <p>McCain would make Bush's tax cuts permanent and increase the tax deduction for dependents. He would also trim the corporate income tax rate. On the whole, McCain's tax plan would reduce federal revenue by $4.2tn, compared to $2.9tn for Obama, according to the Tax Policy Centre.</p> <h2>Iraq</h2> <p>Obama has pledged to begin withdrawing US combat troops from Iraq immediately, and would have all troops out of the country within about 16 months.</p> <p>McCain was a staunch proponent of the war and the later troop \"surge\". McCain was criticised earlier this year for saying US troops could be in Iraq for \"100 years\", but in May he proposed a plan to heavily cut back the US presence by 2013.</p> <h2>Housing market and economic stimulus</h2> <p>Both candidates voted in the Senate for the government's $700bn rescue plan which intended to inject liquidity into the US credit market. </p> <p>Obama further proposes tax breaks for companies that create jobs, extending $25bn to fund road and school construction and maintenance. He would also allow Americans to withdraw from tax-free retirement accounts without penalty until 2010, and would institute a 90-day moratorium on home foreclosures.</p> <p>McCain would spend $300bn to purchase mortgages that have outstripped the value of the home they are attached to, replacing them with fixed-rate loans reflecting the reduced value of the property. He would reduce taxes on retirement account withdrawals until 2010 and would not require retirees to withdraw from retirement accounts if they would face a penalty.</p> <h2>Abortion</h2> <p>John McCain supports overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 US supreme court decision which prohibited states from banning abortion. He believes that states should then pass laws outlawing the procedure.</p> <p>Barack Obama supports women's right to choose abortion and has proposed federal funding for comprehensive sex education and to improve awareness of emergency contraception.</p> <h2>Immigration</h2> <p>Both candidates support a comprehensive immigration reform plan that would establish some path to legal status for the roughly 12 million illegal immigrants living and working in the country. They would both increase the number of visas for low-skilled workers and bolster border security and enforcement.</p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>Obama favours direct, high-level talks with Iran but says if Tehran refuses to give up its nuclear programme, he will step up economic pressure and seek to isolate the regime further.</p> <p>McCain has signalled he will not significantly depart from Bush's policy. He has called for broad sanctions against Iran and a South African-style divestment campaign to persuade Tehran to drop its nuclear programme.</p> <h2>Israel</h2> <p>Obama maintains he is firmly committed to maintaining strong US-Israel ties, including military and economic aid. He would continue US support for a two-state solution, although he caused a stir in June when he said Jerusalem should be the capital of Israel.</p> <p>McCain has pledged to increase military aid to Israel. He has said that the Palestinians are \"badly served\" by Hamas, but he appears willing to broker negotiations. </p> <h2>Energy</h2> <p>Both candidates favour expanding production of biofuels such as corn-based ethanol. Both back expanding nuclear energy usage, but Obama stresses that any new nuclear capacity must be accompanied by adequate environmental and security safeguards. </p> <p>McCain has enthusiastically called for an increase in oil drilling, especially off US coastal waters. Obama initially opposed increased drilling but now says he would consider it as part of a broader energy package that included environmental protections.</p> <p>McCain proposes a $300m prize for the successful development of a plug-in electric car. Obama would offer a tax-credit to purchasers of high-tech energy-efficient vehicles.</p> <h2>Guant\u00e1namo Bay</h2> <p>Both candidates would close the camp. Obama has criticised the system of military tribunals established by Bush, but has offered few specifics on how he would handle prisoners there. McCain supports the tribunals and has vowed to overturn a court ruling granting prisoners the right to contest their detention.</p>",
  "<p>The magic of Bootle and one of Europe's largest scrapheaps have lost Liverpool a lucrative contract with cruise ships bound for the Amazon and other exotic destinations. Tour operator TUI Travel is withdrawing its liner Thomson Celebration from a berth nicknamed the Costa Metallica by holiday reps frustrated with the pace of progress in cleaning up the industrial shoreline of the Mersey.</p> <p>The move, at a time when recession is threatening the holiday business and cruises in particular, means an estimated \u00a34.5m loss in port fees for the once-bustling river. It follows a couple of trial cruises based at Bootle's Langton Dock earlier this year, one of which spent three days moored by the scrapyard because of heavy seas and bad weather.</p> <p>TUI's planned programme of 30 cruises from Liverpool, which would have taken in Greenland and continental European ports, was the city's biggest passenger shipping operation since the heyday of transatlantic liners ended in the mid-1960s. Its withdrawal, to a new base likely to be either on the Tyne or at Southampton, follows prolonged negotiations with the city and Peel Holdings, which runs the Port of Liverpool. Although The Thomson Celebration's 1,300 passengers could enjoy the attractions of this year's European capital of culture, the cruises had to start from the modest Bootle docks rather than the famous Pierhead. The new \u00a317m Pierhead terminal is designed to take only \"port of call\" cruises rather than ships needing a permanent base.</p> <p>David Selby, director of cruising for TUI, blamed a collapse in hopes of using the new terminal while regeneration of the lower Mersey continues on both banks. He said: \"Naturally, we were disappointed that so many local people have not had the opportunity to use such a great facility.</p> <p>\"Customer satisfaction is of paramount importance to us. Therefore, Thomson Cruises felt that it would not be able to offer the quality of service its customers have come to expect if obliged to sail out of Langton Dock. This being the case, it was decided not to continue with this itinerary.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Liverpool city council said that the Pierhead terminal was bound by European competition laws because public money had been used to build it. He added: \"It is also limited to 'port-of-call' ships because it does not have customs or immigration facilities. These are provided by Peel Ports at Langton Dock.\"</p> <p>Liverpool's year in the cultural limelight has been given extra glitz by cruise visits, including one from the QE2 on its farewell tour. Recent renovation has restored much of the infrastructure which the city installed in the Cunard era, when ships such as the Mauretania and Lusitania sailed from the Mersey.</p>",
  "<p>My mother Elsbeth Ganguin, who has died aged 86, arrived in the Manchester suburb of Fallowfield in 1948, a German immigrant with three young children who could speak no English, to join her husband, also a German refugee. Nazi taunts were neither unknown nor unexpected, although our Jewish neighbours were very welcoming.</p> <p>Yet through determination, stubbornness and ability, my mother got herself a series of technical industrial jobs, and, in 1960, became the first woman to join the Manchester Guardian's industrial staff. She got her first byline in 1961, and moved to the London office later that year, before joining the Financial Times in 1963. She subsequently became an industrial and labour correspondent, and, in her later years at the FT, specialised in industrial training topics. Harold Wilson once offered her a cigar \"to keep her quiet\" during a meeting at No 10; on another occasion Robert Maxwell (to her disgust) put his arm around her and said: \"We immigrants must stick together.\" </p> <p>Born in Nordhausen, in central Germany, Elsbeth and her younger sister spent a lot of time at their well-connected grandparents' house in Darmstadt after their parents divorced when she was 10 years old; they were frequently implored to be kind to the little boy (Prince Philip) they played with as his \"home life was so sad\". Their mother's second marriage meant a move to Hungary in 1933, where Elsbeth stayed until 1938, when she enrolled to study chemistry at the Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt. She met my father, Karl Otto (always known as Peter), who was doing a doctorate in photographic science, at a student tea dance in April 1939 and, impulsive as ever, married him that October. </p> <p>During the war, my father initially served in an anti-tank unit. In 1941, he was recalled from the Eastern front to continue his work at the Agfa plant at Wolfen. Immediately after the war, my father learned of a Soviet plan to move Agfa scientists from what was to become East Germany to Russia to work on colour film research. </p> <p>The next day our family fled to west Germany; my mother with her baby daughter Kathrin left with the help of the Americans; my brother Peter and I were taken to the border in a yeast van, from where my grandmother took us by sledge through the snow. My father escaped on foot. In 1947 he was offered employment by ICI in the UK to work on colour film under the British government's Darwin Scheme for the \"employment of German specialist scientists\". He moved to Manchester, leaving my mother and her children in British military government-approved accommodation in Bad Godesberg. </p> <p>An immigrant she may have been, but Elsbeth was proudly British. She retired from the FT in 1972 but continued to contribute articles. After my father's death in 1987, she moved to Surrey and led a quieter life of reading, gardening, swimming and travelling. </p> <p>She is survived by her children, four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>Jimmy Carl Black, who has died of cancer aged 70, was drummer and sometimes lead vocalist with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention between 1965 and the group's bitter break-up in 1970. The Mothers created concerts and albums that mixed pop-Dada, 1950s doo-wop, jazz, schmaltz, Stravinsky, Var\u00e8se and Webern. Black was to the fore as Lonesome Cowboy Burt, a highlight of Zappa's 200 Motels movie (1971). He was the man who introduced himself as \"the Indian of the group\" on the band's album, We're Only in It for the Money (1968), and was a central figure in If We'd All Been Living in California, a dialogue on corporate finances on Uncle Meat (1969).</p> <p>Black, who inherited Cheyenne blood from his mother, was born in El Paso, Texas, but grew up in nearby Anthony on the New Mexican border. He was a soloist in his high school band's brass section, \"but I realised that there was no chance in rock'n'roll for a trumpeter, after Elvis Presley appeared at El Paso Coliseum in 1955. When I saw the effect he had on those women, I thought, 'Man. That's what I want to do!'\"</p> <p>Though he could strum a guitar and had had piano lessons, Black bought a drum kit and practised by playing along mostly to black rhythm and blues records. While serving in the US air force, he joined a country and western trio, Them Three Guys, and, following demobilisation in 1958, played mainstream pop with the Surfs and then the Keys - with whom Black recorded Stretch Pants (1962).</p> <p>Two years later, he moved to Los Angeles, and formed the Soul Giants, who played LA dance halls. When the guitarist was drafted into the army, he was replaced by Zappa, who told the band, according to Black, that \"if you guys learn my music, I'll make you rich and famous\".</p> <p>\"He took care of half of that promise,\" said Black, \"because I'm damn sure I didn't get rich.\" Renamed the Mothers of Invention, the group followed Zappa's masterplan to a qualified prosperity via concerts and, later, albums. \"Frank made me aware of modern classical stuff,\" said Black, \"and very patiently taught me all those complex rhythms and time signatures.\"</p> <p>But Black became increasingly unhappy about Zappa's control. He resented the enlistment of a second drummer, and Zappa claiming authorship of tracks such as If We'd All Been Living in California. \"I never knew he'd taped it at a band meeting,\" he complained. \"I wasn't credited. Everything was 'written, arranged and produced by Frank Zappa'. Then a week after a successful tour, he called us together and said, 'I've decided to break up the band. Your salaries have stopped as from last week.' It was a big shock. I had five kids to feed.\"</p> <p>Postscripts to Black's tenure with Zappa embraced his role in 200 Motels, and an exhumation in 1981 of his character in it, Lonesome Cowboy Burt, for Harder Than Your Husband on Zappa's You Are What You Is album.</p> <p>In 1972 Black had success with two albums as leader of Geronimo Black, named after his youngest son. But by 1974 a Melody Maker interview was conducted in Winebel's Donuts, where he was, indeed, making doughnuts.</p> <p> He then moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, released a solo album, Clearly Classic, which achieved minimal circulation, and joined a Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band world tour.</p> <p>Black then settled in Austin, Texas, where he established the Gentlemen of Colour, a building-and-decorating business with Arthur Brown, the English star of the 1960s Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The firm flourished for 10 years - as did an artistic liaison which was to culminate in an album of R&amp;B standards, Brown, Black and Blue (1980). Black was also performing with Eugene Chadbourne - \"the free-est form guitar player I've ever met\" - and the Grandmothers, initially, former Mothers band members fronted by the Italian guitarist and Frank Zappa lookalike Sandro Oliva. Their CDs included a concert recorded in 1998 at London's Astoria theatre.</p> <p>Increasing success in Europe led Black to move to Vicenza, Italy with his then wife, a schoolteacher with the US army. After her death, he moved to Germany, home of his second wife Monika. In 1995 he began playing with the Muffin Men, the best British interpreters of the work of Zappa and Beefheart. Black was on the road with the group as recently as 2007. Assisted by Roddie Gilliard of the Muffin Men, he was working on an autobiography, For Mother's Sake.</p> <p>He is survived by Monika, three sons and two daughters.</p> <p>\u2022 James Carl Inkanish Black, drummer and singer, born February 1 1938; died November 1 2008</p>",
  "<p>It was a weird Commons committee meeting. The three men charged with getting us out of the financial mess - the chancellor, the governor of the Bank of England and the chairman of the FSA - were summoned by MPs to answer questions sent in by members of the public. It was like a radio phone-in gone horribly wrong.</p> <p>\"Ted Whitton,\" declared John McFaul, chairman of the Treasury committee, \"wants to know 'where has all the money gone?' \"You expected him to add: \"You're on the air, caller\", though of course Mr Whitton was somewhere out in email land.</p> <p>The question was thrown to Mr Darling. He started to waffle. He waffled at immense length. He waffled about problems shared everywhere in the world, extraordinary circumstances, Northern Rock, measures in place, special liquidity scheme ... On and on he droned. Mr Darling's talent is to make the greatest financial crisis of the past 100 years seem like a minor disagreement over a no-claims bonus.</p> <p>If I were Mr Whitton I'd have been at home screaming: \"Answer the sodding question, will you?\"</p> <p>A Mr Gavin Elliot had sent a query. Didn't the \u00a337bn bail-out show that regulation had failed utterly? Lord (Adair) Turner of the FSA wasn't falling for that one. He produced a series of technicalities like a leaf-blower designed to blast Mr Elliot into the nearest compost heap. \"Boom in credit expectation ... capital adequacy regimes ... dynamic provision of capital requirements.\"</p> <p>At one point he insisted that the FSA had used \"extreme stress-tests on the assets of the banks\". He didn't entirely explain. Perhaps members of the FSA creep up behind the assets with blown-up paper bags and go \"bang!\"</p> <p>Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank, said glumly that the bail-out was \"not meant to protect the banks, but to protect us from the banks\". So things were even worse than we thought.</p> <p>Two more questions were read out. I was waiting for someone to say: \"Worr I wanna know is, why didn't Spurs sign Harry Redknapp earlier?\" Or, \"they ban Christmas cribs in school, but the council pays for Diwali lights. To me, that's political correctness gone mad!\"</p> <p>Mr Darling was in philosophic mood. A Mr Gordon Walsh wanted to know why he hadn't been more aware of multinational problems. \"I accept responsibility for everything I am responsible for,\" the chancellor replied, a remark so runic you'd barely make it out on an Anglo-Saxon palimpsest.</p> <p>By this time the committee had grown tired of reading out the punters' questions. I had to sympathise. Where would it end? Would people be allowed to shout down from the public gallery during prime minister's question time?</p> <p>\"Oy, Gordon, what about all these so-called asylum seekers, then?\" Mind you, that's the sort of question plenty of MPs put, though perhaps a little more gracefully.</p> <p>Lord Turner tried, in vain, to persuade everyone that the FSA hadn't been completely blind to the problems of Northern Rock. Things had looked perfectly tickety-boo. This, it turned out, was in spite of the fact that the bank had given 125% mortgages to some people whose total income consisted of Boots discount tokens and Big Issue sales.</p> <p>With the radio audience dwindling fast, Lord Turner killed off the show with \"counter-cyclical capital requirements\", \"capital arbitrage\" and \"reducing the amplitude of the credit cycle\". He finished us all off by announcing \"sometimes the wisdom of crowds is deeply unwise\" - an aper\u00e7u worthy of the master, Donald Rumsfeld.</p>",
  "<p>Democrats are increasingly confident that the US congressional election today will see them extend their majority in the House of Representatives and reduce the Republicans in the Senate to an ineffective rump. Polls yesterday suggest that the Democrats stand to take not only the White House, but will win seven or eight more seats in the Senate, where they already hold 51 of the 100 seats.</p> <p>A Congressional victory on that scale would help Barack Obama to avoid the fate of some of his predecessors, whose legislative plans have often been blocked by hostile Republicans.</p> <p>The Democrats, fighting the congressional race with almost as much intensity as the White House battle, poured millions of dollars into the campaign at the weekend. Obama diverted some of his funds into key Senate and House races in places such as Georgia. Democrats in Senate races had spent more than $67m, against $33.7m by the Republican candidates, as of the end of last week.</p> <p>Despite Congress reaching levels of unpopularity that rival that of President George Bush, voters surveyed by pollsters blamed the economic crisis on Republicans, rather than Democrats, who seem likely to hang on to the gains they achieved in the 2006 mid-term elections. The Democrats may fall just short of the 60 Senate seats needed to prevent the Republicans mounting legislation-blocking tactics such as filibustering.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia, said the Democrats should not become hung up on the 60 figure, and that it would not matter if they failed to reach it. \"The Republicans who are left are going to be irrelevant for the first year of the Obama administration. The Republicans will not have a major role to play,\" he said.</p> <p>He said the concentration on reaching the 60 mark was overdone, because some moderate Republican senators would probably vote with the Democrats, or face trouble being re-elected.</p> <p>Another potential problem facing a Republican rump, according to the political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, is that it could be more conservative than the existing Republican Senate group. According to their analysis, the Republicans most at risk of losing their seat are mainly those on the more moderate wing. A more rightwing Senate grouping might find it harder to attract voters from the centre ground in the congressional mid-term elections in 2010.</p> <p>The three Senate seats most likely to switch from the Republicans to the Democrats today are Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado. Others the Democrats hope to take include Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Oregon.</p> <p>One of the biggest victims of a Democratic rout in the Senate could be Elizabeth Dole, the conservative senator for North Carolina. Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent in Minnesota who famously clashed with the British parliamentarian George Galloway at a Senate hearing on Iraq, is facing a close race against the Democratic candidate, the comedian Al Franken.</p> <p>To reach the filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate, the Democrats will need to take Georgia, Kentucky or Mississippi. That is mainly why Obama announced last Friday that he would begin advertising in Georgia. The state may prove beyond him, but the big turn-out of African-Americans in the state, attracted by his candidacy, offers an outside chance of a Senate upset.</p> <p>In the races for the House of Representatives, where the Democrats have held control since 2006, the party is expecting to extend its lead by a further 25-plus seats.</p>",
  "<p>Berliners went wild that day, 19 years ago. The impossible had happened. The Wall had come down. It was November 9 1989. I wasn't there. But I was there on that same date in 1938, 70 years ago. Germans went wild on that day, too. They let loose an orgy of destruction. The synagogues were set ablaze. Jewish shops were smashed up and pillaged. Jewish men were rounded up, beaten up, some to death, many sent to concentration camps. What eventually followed was unthinkable. The streets that night were strewn with broken glass. The Germans called it Kristallnacht, the night not of broken glass but broken crystal, to symbolise the \"ill-gotten Jewish riches\" Germans would now take from them. Never mind the many Jewish poor. Never mind that Jews such as my grandparents were Germans as deeply patriotic as any of their neighbours.</p> <p>My Christian father, born to Jewish parents, was in 1938 forbidden, as all Jews were, to continue working as a doctor. From a small provincial town we fled to Berlin with one aim, common to thousands of Jews at that time, to find asylum anywhere beyond the reach of Hitler. An only child, six years old, I was given refuge by kindly non-Jewish friends. Life in their basement flat bore no horrors for me. I simply wondered why I was not allowed to go to school. </p> <p>My parents had gone underground. My non-Jewish mother had resisted the pressure to divorce her husband and quit a marriage defined by the Nazis as rassenschande, racial disgrace. My father, hoping not to be picked up on the street, as many were, trudged from consulate to consulate, wearing the miniatures of his two iron crosses won in the first world war. Ruefully he said: \"In 1918, as a German officer, I fled from the French. Twenty years later, I am fleeing from the Germans.\" </p> <p>Now a visa was priceless. The state had confiscated our bank account. We could not bribe our way to safety. With that visa, Nazi Germany could say good riddance. If Kristallnacht had a definable purpose, beyond its pure explosion of hate, it was to make the Jews go away. But, except for the few who had somehow rescued great wealth, the world did not want them.</p> <p>The day of the great pogrom started much like any other. But a rare treat was in store. My mother came to take me for a walk. As a non-Jew she was not directly threatened. Berlin was bathed in autumn sunshine. We walked to the </p> <p>Tauentzienstrasse, Berlin's Regent Street. For me, the big city was full of wonder - until terror struck. Trucks pulled up at exact intervals. Jack-booted men wielding wooden clubs ran up and down the street and began to smash the windows of the Jewish-owned department stores. My mother grabbed hold of me. We fled. I was soon back in a safe place. My parents left Berlin before the day was out and were hidden in Leipzig by a sympathetic member of the Nazi party. In times of crisis, people are not always what they seem to be.</p> <p>The search for asylum became more desperate. It took us another three months. Many were not so lucky. Nations met at Evian on Lake Geneva to discuss the plight of Germany's Jews but shrank from their responsibility. No effective policy emerged. At least the Australian delegate was frank: \"We have no race problem and we don't want to import one.\" He and many others around the world bought into Hitler's fanciful racial doctrine. Antisemitism was not just a German aberration. \"Why should we import a problem the Germans are so keen to get rid of?\" By early 1939, Britain felt \"we have done our bit\". President Roosevelt firmly refused to increase the American quota.</p> <p>Our choice narrowed down to Venezuela and New Zealand. The New Zealand government's attitude was like that of its neighbour. Jewish applicants were told explicitly: \"We do not think you will integrate into our society. If you insist on applying, expect a refusal.\" My father did insist. The barriers were high. Either you had a job to come to, at a time of high unemployment, or you had to produce two wealthy guarantors and in addition bring with you, at today's values, \u00a32,000 per head. We were only able to take that hurdle thanks to the generosity of a remarkable Frenchman, a friend of a distant relative. This was the sort of money most refugees could not possibly raise. At a total of 1,000 German, Austrian and Czech Jews, the New Zealand government drew the line. We were lucky. My grandmother, who hoped to follow us, was not. It was too late. She did not survive the Holocaust. Like many others, she chose suicide rather than the cattle-truck journey to Auschwitz. Britain, thanks to a group of persistent lobbyists, at the last moment agreed to take a substantial number of Jewish children. Most were never to see their parents again. Their contribution to British life was significant, now that the stories of the kindertransport are being told.</p> <p>I tell my story on this anniversary not just for its historic and personal interest, but because it brings into sharp focus the far from humane attitude of Britain, the European Union and many other rich countries to the asylum seekers of today. True, there are now international conventions that did not exist in 1938, but they are seldom obeyed in spirit or in letter. The German sentiment \"send them away\" has given way in Britain and in many other parts of Europe to \"send them back\", sometimes to more persecution and even death. Lessons from history are seldom learned. </p> <p>Dr Peter Selby, president of the National Council of Independent Monitoring Boards, has written with justifiable anger of his experience of Britain's immigration removal centres at ports and airports, which are prisons in all but name. We lock up children, separated from their parents, hold detainees for indefinite periods, and many are made ill by the experience. Those who advocate tougher immigration policies, such as Frank Field's Migration Watch, are accountable, writes Selby, for the coercive instruments - the destitution and detention - that are already being used and will be used even more to enforce it. This is not quite our 1938, but the parallels are deeply disquieting.</p> <p>An even sadder consequence of this story of anti-Jewish inhumanity is that many of the survivors who fled to Palestine did so at the expense of the local people, the Palestinians, half of whom were driven into exile and their villages destroyed. Their children and children's children live in the refugee camps that now constitute one aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian impasse that embitters Islam and threatens world peace: all that a consequence of Nazi terror and indirectly of the Christian world's persecution of the Jewish people over many centuries. </p> <p>With fear bred into every Jewish bone, it is tragic that today many Israelis say of the Palestinians, as once the Germans said of them: \"The only solution is to send them away.\" However understandable this reaction may be, to do so, or even to contemplate it, is a denial of all that is good in Judaism. To create another victim people is to sow the seeds of another holocaust. When, in the 1930s, the Right Rev George Bell, Bishop of Chichester, pleaded in vain for active British support for the German opposition to Hitler, many accused him of being anti-German. The opposite was true. He did not tar all Germans with the Nazi brush. Today, those of us who offer our solidarity to the minority of Israelis working - in great isolation - for justice for the Palestinian people, are often accused of being antisemitic. The opposite is true. It is a tragic parallel.</p> <p>November 9 is deeply etched into German history. On that day in 1918 the Kaiser abdicated. Germany had lost the first world war. Five years later to the day, Hitler's followers were shot down in the streets of Munich. The Nazis, year by year, celebrated their martyrs. Then came 1938: Kristallnacht. Berlin's Holocaust Memorial and other memorials in many German towns and villages, where once the synagogue stood, are mute reminders of what began that day. But the significance and the shame of that day stretches far beyond those who set the synagogues alight. Who, we need to ask, are the victims now, both near and far, and what is our response? </p> <p>\u2022 Canon Dr Paul Oestreicher is a former chair of Amnesty International UK</p>",
  "<p>Picture a primary school in a deprived area of Manchester, where a third of the 450 pupils are considered \"at risk\". Add to that a tragedy involving children from the school, followed by the removal into immigration custody of a nine-year-old boy, at a time when teachers say he was showing signs of recovering from the trauma of his life in the country of his birth.</p> <p>You might imagine such a school to be sombre. From the outside at least, Gorton Mount primary creates that impression - but after a day spent with staff and pupils, it is clear that this is a happy place.</p> <p>Manchester is known as the asbo capital of the UK, and Gorton, where the Channel 4 series Shameless was filmed, has more than its share of problems. Staff say they are as likely to give advice to parents on debt management and nutrition as on academic progress.</p> <p>Carol Powell has been head of Gorton Mount since 2002. In August, when we first spoke, Powell was embroiled in consultations with lawyers and activists, trying to prevent the removal to Iran of a nine-year-old pupil who, along with his mother, brother and sister, had been placed in a detention centre. (The family is now free and the boy is back in class.) Two weeks before, Powell had attended the funeral of a Gorton parent, who had died under a train. The head was also involved in several child protection cases.</p> <p>When Powell took over Gorton Mount, she became the seventh head in six years and the school was in special measures; 66% of pupils are entitled to free school meals. Then, as now, more than 40 languages were spoken and pupil mobility is high. One boy had been to 17 primary schools before arriving at Gorton Mount, because his mother was running away from an abusive partner.</p> <p>Powell oversaw 20 changes of teaching staff in the first two years and now cannot speak highly enough of the team she has around her. Describing them as \"super professionals, inside and outside school\", she says they \"put their own needs on hold in favour of the needs of the children\".</p> <p>According to Hew-ting Yuen, who has taught there for five years: \"All learning starts with the child's emotions. We offer them trust and constant support, and my door is still open to children I taught last year and the year before.\"</p> <p>Steve Williams is a learning mentor. At 42, it is his first job in education. He left school with no qualifications, but says his own experiences (he is African-Caribbean, brought up in a tough, mainly white, area of Manchester) helps him to guide children through similar minefields. He is full of praise for the head, saying she \"orchestrates the ethos of caring that runs throughout the school\".</p> <p>Powell says her team includes every member of staff, including the caretaker and lunchtime organisers. Two of the latter, both local women, have been promoted to learning mentors. One, Dee Malloch, 35, is now studying for a Open University degree and says she is \"learning along with the children\".</p> <p>The other, Sharon Egan, lives on a council estate that borders the school and often acts as a go-between if problems arise with parents. Egan specialises in attendance problems, and tells of visiting the home of one pupil who was not in school. \"The landlord wanted the family out, so he took all the windows out, there was a hole in the bathroom wall and the place was freezing,\" she says.</p> <p>This is where the school can step in. The play therapy room is a pivotal point of Gorton Mount. Two days a week, Christine Taylor, a childcare consultant and therapist, treats children who have suffered trauma. A bright, jumbled room, it is littered with toys and, says Taylor, the child is in \"charge of the play\".</p> <p>Although she does not speak of individual cases, the playroom was crucial in picking up the pieces of a catastrophic episode in the life of Gorton Mount.</p> <p>In April last year, a 12-year-old girl, a former pupil, was shot dead by her 16-year-old brother. The killing was a terrible accident; the boy had found a gun hidden in the family's garden and had been playing with it, close to his sister and eight-year-old twin sisters, when it went off. The twins attended Gorton Mount and, before being imprisoned for three years after pleading guilty to possessing the weapon, the dead girl's mother told the Guardian that the twins had received play therapy at the school and described the staff as \"brilliant\".</p> <p>I suggest to the head that critics might say the emphasis on emotional needs is at the expense of academic achievement. Powell points out that children who lead chaotic lives are usually too anxious to be taught and need an ordered atmosphere before they can start to learn. </p> <p>I joined pupils for lunch in the dining hall. Two eight-year-old boys, Brendan and Connor, were swapping stories about their weekend. Connor who wants to be a mechanic, thinks the school is \"mint\", while Brendan says the teachers are nice and friendly. Asked if she likes school, seven-year-old Kierra declares she \"loves it\". Ten-year-old Kaylum thinks the gardening and piano lessons are the best, and I ask him to name his favourite piece of music. He thinks for a moment. \"Ode to Joy. That's by Beethoven, you know.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barclays has sent me a letter inviting me to \"treat\" myself to a Barclaycard Goldfish. What a nerve. The name Barclays has been poison to me ever since it allowed my mother's savings to shrink like a stabbed balloon, and blagged her into taking out a five-year bond in her 90s. Now it is hellbent on stuffing its executives with monster bonuses, even if it means borrowing squillions from the Gulf states at inflated interest; we are plunging into recession and on the brink of beggary, and here it is egging me on to spend more money. And it is not even my bank.</p> <p>So I read the Goldfish blurb carefully - about four pages of big print and numerous pages of teeny-weeny print, because perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps there really is something worthwhile about this credit card, which offers \"unlimited rewards as you spend\". And 0% \"balance transfers\", but with 2.9% \"handling charge\" - 2.9% of what? I ring and ask. It's an 0844 line, so it's costing me 20p per minute, says the Goldfish person. While I'm at it, I ask what \"touch your card to the reader\" means. Apparently it means that if you want fast service and wish to spend less than \u00a310, you just touch the thingy with your your card, no need for a pin number, and grab your coffee, snacks and the contents of convenience at top speed. And can any robber who snatches your card do it, too? No, answers the information person - probably 20 more pence while he thinks about it, then I ring off. </p> <p>Why waste more money when there is a page clarifying the terminology. \"'We', 'we' [sic] or 'us',' it explains, means Barclays Bank plc ... [and] \"'You' or 'you' [sic] means you, the individual ...\". Rosemary and I studied this for ages to work out whether it was gibberish or we were stupid. We often do this with documents, but found this section to be more or less total toss. </p> <p>Has Barclays no shame? Have any of the immensely rich any shame any more? Are they aware of the boiling hatred welling up in millions of breasts, and do they ever try talking to one of the ordinary people in the street? Because if they did, they'd find that you only have to mention bonuses, banks and greed to any passer-by, and they will each turn at once into Mount Krakatoa, pouring out molten fury. I know because I've conducted my own little survey, saying \"bonuses\" out loud to shoppers, cashiers, to people on buses, at the vets and doctor's, on my dog walkies, and the result is always the same: like pricking the tiniest hole in a big, swollen abscess - something nasty bursts out. </p> <p>Perhaps our government should tap into this rich vein of hatred and outrage, and make sure the bonuses really do end, the banks stop taking the piss, exorbitant executive pay is taxed at 99% and that Roger Jenkins, who brokered Barclays' Middle East funding deal, together with his wife in her mink poncho, will be crammed into the stocks, pelted with Goldfish cards and publicly shamed. If all that could happen before the next general election, then I predict a Labour landslide.</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson is launching a scheme to get Londoners </strong>growing vegetables in 2,012 new places in time for the Olympics. What a heavenly idea. All unused spaces are to be used: wasteland, old railway yards, canal banks, school and hospital gardens, roadside verges and flat roofs. The roofs alone would add up to 24 Richmond parks. And help will be available. Roof owners will be provided with tools and compost. Marvellous. Imagine the transformation: no more scrubby bits of ground spattered with weeds and rubbish, no sea of concrete - just sprouts, tomatoes, beans and carrots as far as the eye can see. It'll be just like the Dig for Victory campaign in the second world war, with the population cooperating for the common good. </p> <p>It's a noble aim. But isn't it a bit late? I feel rather bitter about this plan, thinking of all the lovely green bits that have gone: the bulldozed hospitals such as Friern Barnet and Athlone House in their acres of grounds, all sold and turned into poncey new homes; the school playing fields flogged off for more flats and offices; the extensive prison gardens barely ever used, while the prisoners rot indoors, banged up 22 hours a day; the endless acres of front gardens all paved over to park the cars because it costs too much to park on the roads, or because no one can be fagged with a front garden; and worst of all, those lovely Manor Garden allotments which were flattened to make way for the dreary Olympic site. The plot-holders begged to be allowed to stay and produce food for the athletes - just what Boris is dreaming of - but the brutish London Development Agency wouldn't hear of it. </p> <p>Now those gardeners are stuck in a waterlogged dump in Waltham Forest, where they can hardly grow anything. </p> <p>But let's not be negative. Perhaps Boris will succeed and turn London into a sustainable city, because it needs to be. Without imports, London would run out of food in three days, and then what will we do with all those athletes? So I hope that Boris, backed by Sustain, will bring those allotments back, green all the flat roofs and revive all the wasted spaces, so that the atmosphere and the view will improve, risk of flooding will be reduced, street markets will be bursting with home-grown local products, hospitals and prisons will feed themselves, and children will join in and learn that chips come from potatoes. I hope that Boris's dream comes true, and if it does I will vote for him over and over again.
