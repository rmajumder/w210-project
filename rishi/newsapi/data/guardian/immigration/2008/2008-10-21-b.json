  "<p>Placed in prison and dispatched to the Eritrean army for his faith in Pentecostal Christianity, 18-year-old Mussie Haile remembers escaping from a military base and crossing the border to Sudan by foot. \"It took me three days because I was hiding in the day and walking at night,\" he recalls. </p> <p>In December 2006, he arrived in London and went into foster care. Six months later, he was handed a digital camera and invited to compose a visual documentation of his new life in the capital, with the assistance of photojournalist Crispin Hughes. Fourteen young asylum seekers and refugees, originating from Afghanistan to Angola, were also teamed up with a photographic mentor and asked to engage in a three-month-long dialogue with their newfound surroundings.</p> <p>A series of intimate thoughts and images are recorded in New Londoners: Reflections on Home, a book launched this week at the Tate Modern. Affectionate portraits of social workers as well as observational, community photographs, illustrate the refugees' integration at play, while forlorn landscapes and symbolic objects offer an introspective view of life through a newcomer's lens. </p> <p>\"I haven't been alone before,\" says Haile, who lives in Ilford and has secured refugee status for the following five years. While we look through a collection of his selected photographs: an ironing board, a bowl of pasta, a self-portrait conveying a state of pensiveness, he explains: \"I wanted to clarify my loneliness and to describe how the way of life changes from time to time or from place to place.\"</p> <p>Hughes observes how most of the captions accompanying Haile's images make reference to a former life in the Zoba Maekel district of Eritrea. \"I think he's got a poetic sensibility,\" Hughes adds. He recalls how in the book, Haile describes a ceiling lamp as \"a bulb with protection\". \"It's a bit like the Martian School of Poetry; you see a familiar object and you describe it in a way that's unfamiliar and give everybody a new view of things. Somebody like that can show us things about our own society and make us question our presumptions about our own life, and partly, our own affluence.\"</p> <p>Drawn to the project as someone with roots in community photography, Hughes was careful not to allow the mentorship to get confused with any sort of therapeutic relationship. \"So I never at any point asked probing questions to Haile about his trauma or his background and he seemed perfectly happy to treat this as a job to be done sort of thing,\" says Hughes.</p> <p>While other participants established a deeper bond with the medium of photography \u2013 in some cases setting out related career goals \u2013 Haile saw it more as a gift to offer. \"I want to participate in a friend's wedding, to make them happy. I want to share my skill with whom I want,\" he says. </p> <p>PhotoVoice, an organisation that encourages vulnerable groups to express themselves through photography, worked on the New Londoners project with east London-based Dost, which supports vulnerable children through education, advocacy and therapeutic support, as well as creative outlets. Dost's founder and director, Yesim Deveci, listens to a more confident, ever focused Haile as he outlines his plan to study medicine after completing his GCSEs at Havering College.</p> <p>Of his photographic journey, Deveci says: \"For me, it doesn't look so much like Mussie has changed but that he has more tools to use now.\" </p> <p>Similarly, New Londoners: Reflections on Home can hopefully inspire understanding and integration.</p> <p>\u2022 New Londoners: Reflections on Home is available at the <a href=\"http://www.photovoice.org\">PhotoVoice website</a>. Images from the book can be purchased at the preview evening of the Affordable Art Fair in Battersea Park today</p>",
  "<p>Is there a metaphor for the fortunes of the Australian cricket team in the global economy, I wonder? Think of all the boom times, when opponents were routinely dispatched with such ease that it must have become tedious. It was certainly no time to be a Pom turning up in Australia, hearing as we did each time the patronising plea \"Jeez mate, I hope you blokes can put up a bit of a show this time.\"</p> <p>Well, remember the good days because there will be fewer of them in the future - the recession is here and it would not have needed Robert Peston to forecast it. The quality of the Australian player base seems to be eroding as fast as the Suffolk coastline while Cricket Australia is said to be so devoid of funds (not yet bankrupt but heading that way, I was told recently by someone who would know) that they need to cling on to the coat-tails on any Indian deals they can to stay afloat. They are in hock to Lalit Modi now.</p> <p>The defeat in Mohali should have come as a surprise to no one, only its magnitude. India's victory by 320 runs was the largest, in terms of runs alone, inflicted by them on anyone in 76 years of cricket history, and 98 runs better than their previous best against Australia, three decades and a thousand Tests ago. Only five times previously have Australia fared worse than this week.</p> <p>Of course this does not immediately render the wearers of the Baggy Green as a bunch of duffers. These things are relative, and it is only the second defeat suffered by Australia in 27 Test matches (I don't count the International Cricket Council exhibition thing in 2005, I'm afraid) since the Ashes series of that year.</p> <p>But there has been a trend: 18 matches won and one drawn up to the start of this year; three won, three drawn and two lost (both to India) since then. The old Australia, or even a fairly recent one, would have taken the first Test in Bangalore and steamrollered a win. They could do it in their sleep. Instead they allowed India off the hook. Zaheer Khan, was it, who commented that he had never witnessed an Australian team play so defensively? That would have hurt.</p> <p>The reasons for the decline are for the most part self-evident. No team can afford to lose a whole bunch of giants in such a short period and expect things to stay the same: Steve Waugh, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist are irreplaceable. Justin Langer and Jason Gillespie are both not far behind. It is possible to go back further and point to the retirement of Mark Waugh as the moment that a downturn began for when it is the fractions of percentage points that make a difference, the loss of the finest slip fielder of them all must by definition lead to a lowering of standards.</p> <p>Without those ingredients, and with nothing close to replacements, it was always going to be necessary to re-evaluate the way games would be played. Gilchrist for example, the great get-out-of-jail card, allowed batting bravado higher in the order. With Warne and McGrath, successive captains rarely lost control. These are pragmatic times for most teams and Australia are back in the pack with the pragmatists.</p> <p>It must be such a struggle for Ricky Ponting, who inherited the family business on the downturn. The impetus and aura from a decade of superiority has kept things rolling, but the captain is surely too long in the game not to have had an underlying concern. Many of them have manifested in the last few weeks on the subcontinent: the flawed character that has been seen in Andrew Symonds; the lack of a credible spin option (Cameron White's delivery into a different postcode, as his team lost control in Mohali, could have happened to anyone with sweaty hands but it is still a pratfall); Matthew Hayden's bullying dominance heading for an inevitable end; Ponting's own struggles particularly against the inspired youngster Ishant Sharma.</p> <p>Injuries are kicking in and further disrupting, and while the Indian seamers have reverse-swung the ball wickedly there is little evidence that Troy Cooley, the Australia bowling coach, has revealed to his own pacemen the secrets that he was employed to impart. The edge seems to have gone from Brett Lee too, his well-publicised spat with the captain the other day just further grist to the mill of a side in turmoil.</p> <p>There are still two Tests to go against India and the chance remains that Australia can turn things around, but you would not bet on it. Ponting simply has not got the bowling and it will need more than runs to take this series. A dose of realism rather than blind optimism garnered from deeds of the past would help as well. A month or so ago, another outfit, pre-eminent in its field, thought itself omnipotent. And look what happened to Lehman Brothers.</p> <h2>Then and now</h2> <p><strong>The old invincibles</strong></p> <p><strong>Batsmen</strong></p> <p>Justin Langer (Test batting average 45)<br>Mark Waugh (41)<br>Steve Waugh (51)<br>Damien Martyn (46)</p> <p><strong>Wicketkeeper</strong></p> <p>Adam Gilchrist (Test batting average 47)</p> <p><strong>Bowlers</strong></p> <p>Glenn McGrath (Test bowling average 21)<br>Jason Gillespie (26)<br>Shane Warne (25)</p> <p><strong>The current line-up</strong></p> <p><strong>Batsmen</strong></p> <p>Simon Katich (Test batting average 39)<br>Mike Hussey (67)<br>Michael Clarke (45)<br>Shane Watson (42) </p> <p><strong>Wicketkeeper</strong></p> <p>Brad Haddin (Test batting average 33)</p> <p><strong>Bowlers</strong></p> <p>Peter Siddle (Test bowling average 44)<br>Mitchell Johnson (32)<br>Cameron White (51)</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's path to the presidency narrowed further yesterday with reports that he was giving up on Colorado, a day after a campaign blitz in the battleground state by his running mate, Sarah Palin.</p> <p>The signs of retrenchment for McCain came on a day when Barack Obama was consumed by family concerns. The Democrat is to take a 36-hour break from the campaign tomorrow to visit his seriously ill grandmother in Hawaii.</p> <p>The first reports that McCain had given up on Colorado were carried by CNN on Monday. \"Gone,\" one adviser said. Other campaign officials, while denying they had given up on the state, told CNN they were lessening their reliance on a win in Colorado to take the White House.</p> <p>The campaign was also downgrading its chances in Iowa and New Mexico.</p> <p>The Republicans were hoping to hang on to all three states, which George Bush narrowly won in 2004.</p> <p>But with McCain's limited resources against the fundraising juggernaut of the Obama campaign, the Republican has had to make tough decisions on which battlefields to defend.</p> <p>Obama's lead in Colorado is a more modest 5 points, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. But he has a huge advantage over the Republican in organisation, with 51 field offices in Colorado, compared with a dozen for McCain.</p> <p>\"The McCain campaign, having taken public financing, just can't play everywhere now. They don't have the resources to do that,\" said Bule Sewell, a former chair of the Colorado Democratic party.</p> <p>Obama is also outspending McCain by $300,000 (\u00a3177,000) a week on advertising.</p> <p>McCain's hopes of victory rest on holding on to Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, Missouri and Nevada - as well as taking Pennsylvania. But Obama is even or ahead of McCain in the first seven states and has a 12-point lead in the last.</p> <p>Campaign officials yesterday tried to douse speculation McCain was pulling the plug on Colorado, where Democrats believe that the Republican could be swamped at the polls by the enthusiasm among younger voters and Latinos. However, such decisions are usually kept secret. Last month, McCain faced severe criticism for announcing he was pulling out of Michigan, another battleground.</p> <p>Palin made three campaign stops on Monday in Colorado and McCain is due there on Friday. But the campaign has barely had any advertising presence on radio or television in the state. </p> <p>\"We see the race tightening both internally and in public polling,\" said Jill Hazelbaker, his national communications director. \"We are within striking distance in the key battleground states we need to win.\"</p> <p>Michelle Obama will take a turn as the Democratic headliner on Friday, while her husband is in Hawaii. She is to make campaign stops in Akron and Columbus, Ohio. Her husband is cancelling a rally in Iowa and Wisconsin to visit his grandmother.</p> <p>Obama's absence is unlikely to hurt his campaign. In a campaign of this magnitude and duration, it is not clear how much personal appearances boost a candidate so close to polling day.</p> <p>Obama could also get a sympathy boost for taking time out to visit his white grandmother, Madleyn Dunham, 85. It allows him to demonstrate a commitment to family. He was largely brought up by her.</p> <p>His campaign released photographs of a young Obama with Dunham on his graduation from high school.</p>",
  "<p>The issue of food labelling has always been a tricky one. The traffic-light system, introduced last year by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), shows at a glance the amount of sugar, salt and fat in a particular product, but so far it is voluntary for food producers, plus it requires some work and prior knowledge on the consumer's part. The food industry wants to keep the Guideline Daily Amount system, which shows the percentages of GDA of salt, sugar and fat each portion contains, but health campaigners say this is too complex. Early next year, a study comparing the two is due to report to the FSA. Meanwhile, in the United States a new system could change the way food is labelled for ever.</p> <p>Dr David Katz, a nutritionist and the former director of medical studies in public health at Yale University, who now runs the university's Prevention Research Centre, is the brains behind the Overall Nutritional Quality Index (ONQI), commercially known as the NuVal system. The idea is simple - the higher the score given to a foodstuff, the more nutritious it is. So, broccoli scores the highest, at 100 (as do blueberries, oranges and green beans) while ice pops and fizzy drinks get only one point. Foodstuffs score high for dense amounts of nutrients such as vitamins and protein, but lose marks if they also contain baddies including added sugar, salt, saturated or trans fats. Lobster, for example, scores lower than tinned peaches because it is fairly high in sodium and doesn't provide as much Omega 3 fats as other fish. The crackers, which score a shocking two points, are \"saltine\" crackers, a generic American white-flour cracker with added salt, sugar and trans fat. \"Empty calories,\" says Katz.</p> <p>So far, three supermarket chains in the US have adopted ONQI, with another 15 to 20 companies planning to get involved next year. Katz hopes that it will eventually be used in up to 7,000 stores across the country. </p> <p>Katz came up with ONQI when he and a number of other nutritionists were invited by the US secretary of health to submit one idea each to combat obesity. Katz wanted to create a single measure of nutritional quality and apply it to every food product sold in supermarkets (research and ONQI score allocation is ongoing). When the government didn't take him up on his proposal, Katz got funding to develop it from a local hospital (no investment from the food industry was involved). </p> <p>\"I have long been aware that it's all very well giving people advice when they come to see me, but it can be difficult for them to follow in the real world,\" he says. \"You say to people, 'Eat a healthy diet,' or 'Eat a Mediterranean diet,' but nobody chooses a diet, they choose foods. You're in the bread aisle in a supermarket and you know that wholegrain bread is more nutritious, but you're bombarded with so many different types vying for your attention - 'fortified with vitamins', 'good source of fibre'.

  "<p>It is one of the biggest workforces in the UK. Yet the estimated 1.4 million staff who deliver social care to people at home or in residential settings have also been one of the most invisible - and neglected. But things might be about to change - service providers around the country, as well as many of the local authorities that commission services, say they are facing a recruitment and retention crisis - a crisis that could threaten the very basis of the government's personalisation agenda.</p> <p>\"This is serious,\" warns one learning disabilities provider. \"The market is tougher at the moment than I've known it in 30 years in the business.\"</p> <p>The government also seems to have woken up to the seriousness of the situation and is planning to launch a new social care workforce strategy later this year. So what is the scale of the problem?</p> <p>Although there are difficulties throughout the sector, the most acute problem affects the care workers at the bottom end of the staffing pyramid - those working in care homes or in people's own homes, who make up nearly two-thirds of the workforce. It is widely accepted that their workload is becoming increasingly complex, yet the rewards are desperately low. According to figures from Skills for Care, the sector's training and skills body, a care worker's average hourly pay last year was just \u00a36 - 48p above the then minimum wage.</p> <p><strong>High turnover</strong></p> <p>Not surprisingly, it is proving ever more difficult for homes and agencies to hire staff. And when they do find someone, the strong likelihood is that they will be gone again within a couple of years. The turnover rate among care assistants in care homes is running at around 25% a year and in home care it rises to over 28%, meaning the average employer will have to renew their workforce at least every four years.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the population ages and the government's personalisation agenda is implemented, the demand for social care is growing inexorably. Some estimate that the current workforce will need to nearly double by 2025 to cope with the demand.</p> <p>Yet a number of factors seem to be conspiring to make recruitment tougher, rather than easier. A chief cause for concern is the recent decision by the government's Migration Advisory Committee (Mac) not to include social care on the list of shortage occupations to be exempted from immigration restrictions which would prevent non-EU care workers taking up permanent jobs in the UK.</p> <p>Care providers have increasingly come to rely on migrant labour to fill the gaps in the workforce. Around one in five domiciliary workers comes from abroad, for instance, and in London this rises to over two in five. \"This is a timebomb we're sitting on,\" says Jo Cleary, co-chair of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services's workforce development network. \"Mac's decision could seriously harm our ability to recruit desperately needed care staff and damage our ability to care properly for large numbers of vulnerable people.\"</p> <p>Providers are also facing a range of additional costs, including new statutory holiday entitlement (expected to add 2% to the wage bill) and the probability of VAT being added to agency costs. Further, there is uncertainty over an EU ruling which appears to count sleepover duties as part of working hours. Interpreted strictly, this could cause turmoil for both care homes and 24-hour home care.</p> <p>So far there is little evidence that local authorities are taking these extra costs into account in their contracts with private providers. Indeed, last year, 38% of authorities failed to increase their contract fees at all.</p> <p>That has inevitable consequences, says Lesley Rimmer, chief executive of the United Kingdom Homecare Association. \"The independent sector have been pilloried for being a low pay employer but they can only pay what they are given under contract by the local authorities. Authorities have much higher in-house rates of pay for their own staff, whereas they don't seem to feel the same rules apply for independent providers.\"</p> <p>The differentials created by this approach also lead to a huge amount of \"churn\" in the market, with staff frequently moving jobs in search of relatively small pay increases. \"This is costly in terms of recruitment and induction costs, but you're also going to lose the continuity of care for clients - and that's perhaps the most important thing,\" says Rimmer.</p> <p>Just about everyone agrees low pay lies at the heart of this crisis. \"There needs to be a wholesale approach in terms of higher status for people working in this sector, rewarding them for their training, and one of the central ways to do that is to raise their pay,' Rimmer argues,</p> <p>Skills for Care chief executive Andrea Rowe points out: \"The personalisation agenda means [NVQ] level three will have to be the core level for most staff. But at the moment employers only pay 33p more for level three compared to level two - that's no incentive in terms of reward.\"</p> <p>Rowe thinks low pay could actually be attracting the wrong people into the job. \"I have a theory that people come into the workforce because they can and because there are no entry requirements. Then when they get in we hit them with all this regulation and registration and some people think: this is not what we're wanting.\"</p> <p>That in turn leads to rapid turnover, which can fatally undermine planning, continuity and good, long-term care. The sector needs to be much more open about what the demands of the job are going to be, says Rowe. \"We need to focus more on the right sort of people who will see this as career development and a real job.\"</p> <p><strong>Targeted recruitment</strong></p> <p>Social care needs also to reach out urgently to new areas of recruitment such as men, who currently make up only 15% of the care workforce, and those who have been informal carers at home. \"I don't think we do enough to target recruitment to carers at the moment,\" Rowe says. \"Many people care as part of their life cycle and then may think: I want to do that as work afterwards. I don't think we capture that reservoir of people with that experience.\"</p> <p>For this reason the fact that the social care workforce is relatively old - the mean average age is 42 - could be part of the solution, not a problem. Indeed, Rowe thinks the average could rise in the future as more people in their 60s and 70s find the work an attractive option.</p> <p>For social care, the credit crunch may contain a silver lining. For a while at least, recruitment problems could lessen as the swelling ranks of the unemployed become less fussy about what work they do. Latest, provisional figures from Skills for Care already indicate some falls in turnover and vacancy rates. \"I would have thought that at the moment the situation is easing slightly,\" Rimmer says. \"But let's be under no illusions. It's only temporary and doesn't affect the underlying position.\"</p>",
  "<p>Darek is a 30-year-old Polish builder who lives in Ealing, west London. Like a million or more of his compatriots, he rushed to the UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">when Poland joined the EU in 2004</a>. He works hard, but his foppish British boss, Peter, wants him to work harder. \"If I had wanted it to take five days I would have hired Brits. But I had three days, which is why I hired you,\" Peter tells Darek.</p> <p>The scenario may be familiar to people in towns and cities across Britain but Darek is not a real migrant worker. He is one of the lead characters in Londynczycy (Londoners), a big budget Polish drama series which follows the lives of a group of Poles as they seek their fortune in London. The show is the first Polish attempt to tackle the post-accession wave of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/immigration\">immigration</a>, which has seen many of Poland's brightest young people relocate to Britain, where they often end up working in badly paid jobs for which they are vastly overqualified.</p> <p>Other key characters are Mariola, a 25-year-old who has come to London with a suitcase full of blonde hair dye and skimpy outfits and two goals: to become a star and to marry a rich English gentleman. She is confident of success. \"Polish girls are in right now,\" she tells her friend Asia, a 19-year-old who has abandoned her sleepy farming village to get mixed up in the narcotics trade in \"Londyn\". </p> <p>Peter, the hapless English boss, would agree. \"They have this sexy Slavic thing going on,\" he tells Darek, demanding to be introduced to some \"hot and easy\" Polish women in return for a reprieve from his impossible building deadline.</p> <p><strong>Competitions</strong></p> <p>Due to start tomorrow in a primetime slot on TVP1, Poland's answer to BBC1, it is perhaps the most hyped TV show in recent memory in Poland. Billboards featuring the legend \"Wielka Brytania, wielke nadzieje\" (Great Britain, Great Expectations) have been plastered all around the country, featuring four of the lead characters against the backdrop of the union flag. Polish radio stations in the UK and Poland have run wildly successful competitions offering listeners the chance to be extras - quite a prospect, given the pedigree of the cast. </p> <p>Robert Wi\u00e9ckiewicz, is well known in Poland for playing hardmen, but here he takes the role of downtrodden Marcin, a 40-something history teacher who follows his wife and son to London, but can't get a job, and ends up drinking cans of Lech on the capital's benches. Another star name is Gr\u00e1zyna Barszczewska, Poland's answer to Helen Mirren, who plays Nina, who arrived in London during the second world war and now helps the new wave of Poles by renting them cheap rooms.</p> <p>Most Poles will admit that until now, most of their indigenous TV drama has been pretty tawdry-looking stuff churned out for very little money. But with a budget of 13.5m zloty (\u00a33m), Londoners has been able to up the ante, filming its interior shots in Poland, where studio space is still very cheap, and splurging on flashy exteriors shot on location in London. There are scenes at Wembley stadium, on the London Eye, at the South Bank Centre and at other less postcard-familiar spots around the capital including Victoria bus station, a Polish deli and a Western Union money transfer outlet.</p> <p><strong>Racism</strong></p> <p>Visually, Londoners recalls a smart, urban show like Queer as Folk. Its gritty storyline, which tackles racism, homophobia and exploitation, wouldn't look out of place on EastEnders, and its strangers-in-a-strange-land set-up, complete with builders, is reminiscent of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. Its producers, Twilight Films, which is based in Ealing Studios, are currently trying to sell the show to a British channel, which isn't as preposterous as it might sound. Over half of the dialogue is in English, which will be subtitled for the Polish audience.</p> <p>According to Andrzej Szajna, London-based producer of the series, the writers spent three weeks talking to Poles living in Finchley, north London, to come up with the storylines. \"All of the scenarios are based on true stories they were told,\" said Szajna last week on set in Richmond, south London.</p> <p>He is adamant that while Londoners is no advert for Britain, showing as it does Poles falling on very hard times, it offers a favourable picture of British people. \"The baddies are all Poles. It is Polish people who are screwing over other Poles, which is so often the case in real life. There is one scene where there is a girl looking at adverts in a shop window, and a few other Poles come up and say they can help her find a good job in return for \u00a3100. You hear stories like that all the time.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday October 25 2008. Poland joined the EU in 2004, not 2005 as we said in the article above. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Until recently, the word oligarch invariably conjured up the name of one rather rich Russian businessman, Roman Abramovich. The owner of Chelsea FC had become virtually synonymous with Russia's elite, embodying its foibles, excesses and passions. But in recent weeks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oleg-deripaska\">Oleg Deripaska</a>, a 40-year-old metals tycoon and a friend of Abramovich, has dominated the headlines. This year Deripaska overtook Abramovich as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>'s richest man. In May Forbes Russia magazine estimated his fortune at $28.6bn (\u00a317bn). </p> <p>Deripaska's wealth derives from ownership of the world's largest aluminium producer, UC Rusal. In an interview with the Guardian last year, he shrugged off the suggestion he was Russia's leading tycoon. Asked how much he was worth, he replied: \"I don't know.\" But Deripaska's rise has not been without controversy. There have been claims - denied by the oligarch - of links to organised crime. In 2006 the US state department revoked his American visa. Deripaska has also been involved in a series of legal cases in the US and London, where a former partner, Michael Cherney, is suing him for $4bn in the high court.</p> <p>These acrimonious disputes date back to the 1990s when, as Deripaska puts it: \"The country was in a sort of decay.\" The Soviet Union had just collapsed. A new class of businessman - the oligarchs - ruthlessly carved up Russia's freshly privatised state industries. These included oil, gas and aluminium. Deripaska became embroiled in the struggle for control of an aluminium smelter in Sayanogorsk in Siberia. The battle was so vicious, and so corpse-strewn, it became part of privatisation legend, and dubbed the \"aluminium wars\". </p> <p>He dismisses claims that at one point his enemies tried to blow him up on a mountain road using a grenade launcher. \"It's a joke,\" he remarked. But his reputation for ruthlessness dates from this period when - it's not entirely clear how - he managed to overcome the local mafia.</p> <p>Like many super-wealthy Russians, Deripaska is a keen Anglophile. He has a \u00a320m house in Belgravia. He speaks fluent idiomatic English, learned while he studied theoretical physics at Moscow's state university. Deripaska's young son and daughter have also mastered the language, thanks to their English nanny. Asked about his view of the British, Deripaska said: \"They are very honest and decent people, very well educated.\" His also has interests in the UK: in 2006 his investment company Basic Element bought the ailing British van-maker LDV.</p> <p>Like many oligarchs, Deripaska has humble origins, growing up in a village in southern Russia with his widowed mother, an engineer. As a boy, he milked his family's cows and fed the ducks. </p> <p>He graduated just as science funding in post-communist Russia collapsed. Instead of physics, he went into business. In 1993-4 he accumulated a 20% stake in a Siberian aluminium factory. In 2000 Abramovich bought most of the holdings in Russia's aluminium industry and merged them with Deripaska's company. They created Rusal - Russian aluminium. Abramovich later sold his stake to Deripaska, leaving Deripaska the undisputed tsar of one of the world's most lucrative industries. </p> <p>Along the way, he has demonstrated a knack for cultivating the rich, powerful and important. In 2001 he married Polina Yumasheva - daughter of Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff Valentin Yumashev. Deripaska is also close to Vladimir Putin. At home Deripaska has keenly obeyed the key rule of the authoritarian Putin era: don't meddle in politics. As a result, his fortunes have prospered.</p>",

Hawkes decided to go for a swim after heading to the beach for a post-lunch coffee with his wife. His bride, Danielle, said strong undercurrents had carried him out to sea. She said: \"One minute he was OK and the next he was being pulled away from me.

The company says only pre-1900 antiques with small amounts of ivory such as tables with small inlays or pianos with ivory keys will be allowed. Items with a \"significant amount\" of ivory, regardless of age, such as buttons, chess sets, and jewellery will not be permitted following the company's discussions with the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the conservation organisation WWF.<br><strong>James Meikle</strong></p> <h2>Guant\u00e1namo detainee faces new charges</h2> <p>All charges against Binyam Mohamed, the British resident held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, have been dropped by the US military but new charges are likely to be brought shortly and he remains in solitary confinement. The so-called convening authority, Susan Crawford, said the charges had been dropped \"without prejudice\" but new charges were to be framed within 30 days. Mohamed, 30, an Ethiopian asylum seeker, has claimed he was tortured to obtain a confession.

The farm, built by energy company Centrica, will produce power for 130,000 homes, raising the total electricity generated from offshore wind in the UK to 590MW, enough for 300,000 homes. The UK has overtaken Denmark, which has 423MW of offshore wind turbines.

  "<p>\"Our failure to resource the asylum processes has caused untold human misery,\" said Phil Woolas, the immigration minister. And he's right. But might the problems go beyond money? Could some of it be attitudinal? Take recent events at Yarl's Wood detention centre, where officials have been breaking their own rules by depriving asylum-seekers of a book advising them of their rights. The guide, which collates publicly available information on legal, medical and relevant human rights issues, has been confiscated from at least two who wanted to challenge their detentions. One, Mercy Wanjiku, from Kenya, had hers taken away last Tuesday, which somewhat hampered her attempt to meet an appeal deadline on Friday. She didn't see it again until Thursday, by which time the Black Women's Rape Action Project had reported the confiscation to the police, saying the confiscation amounted to theft. Officials tell us these were isolated incidents and that a contractor is culpable; but all things being equal, Ms Wanjiku will be on a plane tomorrow. As if the odds weren't stacked enough. </p> <p>\u2022 So in the course of a jolly to Corfu, George Osborne failed to spend as much quality time with Rupert Murdoch as he intended, ignited a row over what he did or didn't say to Oleg Deripaska - and now he may have trashed his relationship with the Rothchilds, one of the best-connected families in the world and donors of note to the Tory party. What a star. What a trip. </p> <p>\u2022 But enough jollity: there is something very wrong in the world of Melanie Phillips. This is her lament on <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk\">spectator.co.uk</a>. \"You have to pinch yourself - a Marxisant radical who all his life has been mentored by, sat at the feet of, worshipped with, befriended, endorsed the philosophy of, funded and been in turn funded, politically promoted and supported by a nexus comprising black power anti-white racists, Jew-haters, revolutionary Marxists, unrepentant former terrorists and Chicago mobsters, is on the verge of becoming President of the United States. And apparently it's considered impolite to say so.\" Luckily, she said it. </p> <p>\u2022 What are we to make of revelations that special branch opened a file in 1968 on the poet Adrian Mitchell? A previously classified report on a Youth CND demonstration against the Vietnam war records that \"Adrian Mitchell recited one of his poems, the meaning of which was largely unintelligible.\" Other material suggests there was further reporting. Some references are redacted even now. Mitchell tells us that he probably excited interest after attending a Communist party wine and cheese party for peace at Oxford. \"I wasn't a communist, but I like wine,\" he says. \"And cheese. And peace.\"</p> <p>\u2022 But then many have spent the year trying to make sense of 1968. This month, at a seminar, the University of Salford will try. \"We are still waiting for the political nomination of these opaque events to be completed,\" the blurb says. \"But we are not merely waiting; we are eager to come to grips with this excess and therefore to pursue the related tasks of politically unfolding its consequences and philosophically operating its contemporary articulation with ruptures produced elsewhere and thinking the re-emergence of new possibles and thus the very possibility of a true politics.\" Who wrote this? Sarah Palin?</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, as the world cries out for an economic summit along the lines of that so famously staged at Bretton Woods in 1944, we pay tribute not to Keynes, for everyone does that, but to Jean Gregory, his personal assistant, whose shorthand notes of the great man's pronouncements played a pivotal role in the success of this historic event. Now 89, she is loth to make too much of her role, but her son Ben tells us that \"as Lord Keynes spoke so quietly, most of his input was probably read from her typing later\". Without it, there's no telling how the industrialised world would have coped. She says that the in-joke at the conference was the cry, \"Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your Keynes\", which is hardly a showstopper but it was of its time, and helped put the world back on track. We could say the same of Jean.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The long-running legal battle between the British government and the Chagos islanders over their eviction from their homes in the Indian Ocean nearly 40 years ago will reach its conclusion in the House of Lords this morning. </p> <p>The law lords will deliver their ruling on whether the surviving islanders have the right to return, after being removed from the archipelago to make way for the US base on Diego Garcia.</p> <p>Nine Chagossians flew in from their current homes in Mauritius yesterday, joining exiles who have settled in Crawley to hear the judgment of Lords Bingham, Hoffman, Rodger, Carswell and Mance.</p> <p>Today's ruling is the last stage of a lengthy legal battle launched in the name of Olivier Bancoult, one of the evicted islanders, in 1998. </p> <p>Both the divisional court and the court of appeal have ruled in favour of the Chagossians' right to return to the outer islands, which do not include Diego Garcia, but the Foreign Office appealed against those judgments in the Lords. \"We remain hopeful that once and for all there will be a conclusion that will see justice for the Chagossian people,\" said Bashir Khan of the Chagos Refugees Group UK. </p> <p>Britain took the Chagos islands from France in the Napoleonic wars and, under a 1971 immigration ordinance, removed the inhabitants compulsorily so that the main island in the archipelago, Diego Garcia, could be used as a US base. After the evictions, which took place over a number of years, the islanders were exiled to Mauritius and Seychelles, more than 1,000 miles from their homes, where many slipped into poverty and drug and alcohol addiction. While only a small number say they would return to the islands to live, they have argued that all Chagossians should be granted the right to return.</p> <p>The law lords were told in the hearing in July that Diego Garcia had been regarded by the US since 9/11 as \"a linchpin for the UK's allies\". The US has claimed that even allowing the Chagossians to return to other islands presents a security risk.</p> <p>The Foreign Office argued in the hearing that allowing the Chagossians to return would be \"precarious and costly\".</p>",
  "<p>News that a respected international analyst like the OECD had reported that inequality and poverty \"fell faster in the UK\" than in any comparable country in the first half of the decade briefly led BBC news bulletins yesterday before being blown away by August high jinks on Corfu. </p> <p>But the Watergate maxim \"follow the money\", which George Osborne invoked in his Corfu defence, also applies to poverty. Though few voters seemed to be listening, James Purnell, the works and pensions secretary, put out a statement claiming that the OECD's findings show \"a real change for the better in reducing inequality\" - thanks to progressive taxation, active efforts to get people back into work and the impact of redistributive policies on working families.</p> <p>In his decade as chancellor, Gordon Brown was as wary of using the \"R for redistribution\" word as he now is to use \"R for recession\"; hence the Tory \"stealth tax\" jibe. And the OECD verdict is not wholly flattering. Yes, income inequality rose in 2000-2005 in Canada, Germany, Norway and the US, where George Bush was cutting taxes for the rich, while it fell in Mexico and UK.</p> <p>Income poverty and child poverty fell. But the OECD, often critical of Britain's unbalanced, finance-driven economy, notes that it remains a country of low social mobility, highly unequal incomes and jobless households. All are bad for social cohesion, education and health.</p> <p>Did Labour miss a trick in not trying harder to trumpet this modest success all the same, perhaps because Brown has told Whitehall that the fight against global economic collapse is the only fight that currently matters? It would seem so. Mark Pearson, an OECD report author, calls the change \"quite remarkable.\"</p> <p>Purnell's department knew the report was coming and now claims it proves that the UK is \"in the forefront of the battle against poverty and inequality\". An exaggeration, but OECD's emphasis on skills, education and jobs all chimes with Brown's agenda since 1997. </p> <p>But poverty analysts in thinktanks like the Institute for Fiscal Studies still urge caution. Brown has been very lucky in the OECD's 2000-05 choice of years, they say. In 1997, Brown stuck to inherited Tory spending plans, squeezing benefits and pensions while the stock market boom pushed up the incomes of the rich until the dotcom bubble burst. </p> <p>After 2000 his tax credits scheme came on stream. Together with the New Deal drive to get the long-term unemployed back to work it boosted the income of families with kids. After the 95p pension rise controversy, pensioners also got help. Tax revenues remained unexpectedly buoyant, helping to finance better schools and the NHS; they help reduce inequality too.</p> <p>So the poorest - those below 60% of the median post-tax household income (\u00a319,646 in 2006-07) - gained ground on the middle class. The rich motored on. By general consent among experts, that modest progress has probably stalled since 2005 as those tax revenues faltered. Alistair Darling's 2008 budget was good for poor children. But the long battle against poverty is far from won.</p>",
  "<p>A little shudder went through me every time they said it. \"President Obama's first priority will be this,\" they would begin. Or, \"The Obama administration will find that ... \" Travelling in the US last week, I lost count of the pundits, experts and Democratic insiders I heard speak with such confidence. And each time they did, I felt the urge to mutter: \"Presuming he wins.\"</p> <p>Call it superstition, but it's one rooted in years of unhappy experience. After the British general election of 1992, or the Al Gore and John Kerry defeats of 2000 and 2004, the centre-left has surely learned that you don't count your chickens till they're hatched, squawking and deep into middle age. Which is why I won't believe an Obama presidency is possible until the morning of November 5 - and even then I'll wait till inauguration day on January 20, just to be sure. </p> <p>This is not fully rational. But who said elections are rational? They call it political science, but there's all too little that's scientific about it. Otherwise you could weigh the data and draw definite conclusions about what is about to happen. But politics doesn't work like that. </p> <p>Rationally, I know, every indicator points to a clear victory, if not a landslide, for Barack Obama. He is ahead in the polls, including in most of the key battleground states that will determine the winner. John McCain has now given up on Michigan, Iowa, Colorado and New Mexico - and is betting everything on taking Pennsylvania, a state even Kerry managed to hold four years ago. McCain's path through the electoral college is now narrow and perilous. </p> <p>What's more, he is low on ammunition. He has just $47m to spend, while Obama raised more than three times that amount, breaking every record, last month alone. In the air war of TV advertising, McCain is coming under saturation bombardment: for every ad he runs, Obama has three, four, even eight. </p> <p>Just as important, Obama is outgunning McCain on the ground. He has field offices, staffed up and teeming with volunteers, in the unlikeliest of places - small towns that cannot remember the last time anyone remembered them. Fivethirtyeight.com's Sean Quinn has been dropping in on those and on the McCain operation and describes a stunning contrast. Not only do Obama's offices outnumber McCain's by four to one, but the latter are often empty or near-empty, filled with lines of unused phones, just one or two people making calls. Quinn added up the number of McCain volunteers he had seen in six states - and it equalled the number working for Obama in the single town of Durango, Colorado. </p> <p>The intangible signs are just as positive for Obama. The endorsement by Colin Powell got all the attention, but the Democrat has also won the backing of conservative newspapers, from the Houston Chronicle to the Idaho Statesman. No one pretends such endorsements swing elections, but they tell you something about the prevailing wind. </p> <p>And yet I still won't say this election is over. For one thing, there is no precedent for this contest: an African-American nominee for a major party is a first. We simply don't know if the notorious Bradley effect - whereby more voters tell pollsters they plan to back black candidates than actually vote for them - will bite on November 4. Last week senior Democrats were telling me to look at the Tennessee senate race of 2006. Pre-election polls showed the African-American Democrat, Harold Ford, behind by three points - and he lost by three points. The polls got it right; ergo, the Bradley effect is dead.</p> <p>But this is a presidential race; it's different. A pessimistic gut instinct tells me that older, white voters across Appalachia could break for McCain, putting Ohio and West Virginia in his column. Perhaps McCain thinks the same and that's what's prompted him to bet everything on Pennsylvania. With a relentlessly negative message in this last stretch, powered by robocalls suggesting Obama pals around with \"domestic terrorists\" and by fliers photomontaging Obama's face with that of Osama bin Laden or subtly linking him to 9/11, Republicans believe they can plant just enough fear that Obama is an alien, un-American stranger - \"Not who you think he is,\" says one leaflet - to make November 4 a very long night. Meanwhile, if Democrats grow complacent, and young voters don't turn out, believing victory is already in the bag, those Republicans could be proved right.</p> <p>But let's say I'm too much of a worrier and that we should trust the objective data - let's dare ask the question now exercising the chatterers in Washington and beyond. What would an Obama presidency be like? </p> <p>The first, depressing thought is that, if the result is close 13 days from now, Republicans will seek to challenge Obama's very legitimacy. That sounds far-fetched: after all, George W Bush only won in 2000 thanks to a single vote on the supreme court and the Democrats did not hesitate to salute him as the commander in chief. But Republicans play by different rules. Recall the treatment meted out to Bill Clinton. He won fair and square in 1992 and again in 1996, but that did not stop Republicans using every means to cast him as essentially unfit for high office - culminating in the impeachment effort of 1998. They will surely follow the same approach towards a President Obama. Indeed, they're doing it already: last week McCain campaign manager Rick Davis claimed a \"cloud of suspicion\" hangs over the election, because of Obama's links to Acorn, a grassroots group accused of trying to register bogus voters. That sounds a lot like a party preparing either to make a legal challenge to a close result - or to brand the eventual winner as illegitimate. </p> <p>If Obama wins big, that will be a harder case to make. Then what? Some Democrats are growing excited at the prospect of what could be the strongest, most progressive administration since the Lyndon Johnson landslide of 1964. That may not be wholly delusional. On current projections, the Democrats are on course to win both the House and perhaps a filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate. Obama would have the muscle to drive through a truly radical programme. </p> <p>Still, the voice of caution nags. First, the precedents are not encouraging. Both Clinton and Jimmy Carter were greeted by a fully Democratic Congress - and both got snarled up early. If the smoothness of his campaign is any guide, Obama will be a savvier operator than either of those two predecessors. But the danger is real. </p> <p>Second, Obama could be constrained by a simple fact: the cupboard is bare. After years of profligacy and Bush's ballooning deficits, there is too little money around for a raft of government projects that would cost dear. </p> <p>And yet, Obama has made clear that he holds the Keynesian view that a recession is precisely the time to start spending money. What's more, the banking crisis has so thoroughly discredited the laissez-faire approach to free markets, that the public mood is conducive to a shift leftward. One US historian suggests Americans only allow a dramatic expansion in government after a great rupture: FDR was preceded by the crash of 1929, LBJ by the Kennedy assassination of 1963. If that's true, then Obama might indeed prove to be, as Powell predicted, a \"transformational president\". </p> <p>See, even I'm at it now - getting way ahead of myself. Of course Obama has the potential to do all kinds of great things, but we're not there yet. First, he has to win. <br><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\"><br>freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The death of Jack (Jean Louis) Kerouac at the age of 47 brings the beat generation officially to a close. Just a year ago Neal Cassady, the real life prototype of Kerouac's fictional hero Dean Moriarty of \"On the Road\" died in Mexico. Now there is only Allen Ginsberg.</p> <p>Kerouac was the inventor of the \"beat generation\"; at least he invented the label. He used it in a conversation with the writer John Clellon Holmes and Holmes later used it in a novel. The expression was then hymned in a headline [in] the New York Times Literary Magazine.</p> <p>\"On the Road\" was not published until 1957, although it was written in 1952. Kerouac had been lionised a bit in New York for his first novel \"The Town and the City\" which he had lived with a long time.</p> <p>But between \"The Town and the City\" and the tremendous fame of \"On the Road\" in 1957, there were five years when he could not find a publisher. Kerouac at that time, poor and hoboing around, seemed to have a grand period, writing what many people consider his best novels: \"Dr Sax,\" \"Maggie Cassidy,\" \"Visions of Cody,\" \"The Lonesome Traveller,\" producing two books a year.</p> <p>It was a literary flowing rather like the few years in which William Faulkner wrote \"Sanctuary,\" \"As I Lay Dying\" and \"Light in August.\" But it was the publication of \"On the Road\" that made him famous and he never lived down that book.</p> <p>People identified him with the fast-driving characters, while in fact Kerouac was a slow and nervous driver. His novels afterwards sank at times into a swamp of self-indulgence.</p> <p>But there is something lovely about his best work, particularly \"Dr Sax\" and \"Maggie Cassidy\" where he is able to bring to life, in the warmth of his own French-Canadian relatives, those brown milltowns of New England (he was born in Lowell, Massachusetts). So, too, when he was travelling across the country he would turn up long lyrical passages about the then vanishing and now perhaps disappeared America: that America of old hotels, railroad sidings, and lunch counters with steaming coffee urns. His feeling for this vanishing America was in its own way as true as Melville's feeling for the sea or Mark Twain's for the Mississippi.</p> <p>In spite of his rugged athletic appearance, the boney Breton face with the black curly hair, his friends have for almost ten years now been regularly predicting his death, a death as much from the final draining of the spirit as anything else.</p>",
  "<p>A \"perfect storm\" could be building for US election day on November 4 because of a combination of sky-high voter interest, new ballot machines and a shortage of poll staff, the independent Pew group warned yesterday.</p> <p>The Washington-based group set out a long series of problems still facing the US despite reforms aimed at avoiding a repeat of the 2000 and 2004 debacles.</p> <p>The launch of the 77-page report came as legal clashes over voter registration and hours-long queues formed outside booths set up for early voting in states across the US. Voting is now underway in 46 of the 50 states, though election day is still almost a fortnight away.</p> <p>Virginia, a battleground state, said it will step up security at polling booths on November 4. Election officials fear trouble because of passions aroused by the election, by long queues, or by people being told they are not eligible to vote.</p> <p>Doug Chapin, director of Pew's electionline.org, said: \"People talk about meltdown. It is over-optimistic to think that 130 million people can vote and something does not go wrong ... We have spent eight years sorting the plumbing, but on November 4 we are going to crank up the system.\"</p> <p>The excitement created by Barack Obama could result in a record turnout, with African-Americans and young voters, both previously less likely to vote, predicted to cast ballots in large numbers this time round. New voters are registering in record numbers in almost every state.</p> <p>Officials in Virginia recently ordered 200,000 more voter registration forms.</p> <p>Thousands of lawyers are being recruited by Obama and John McCain to police polling booths, offering advice to supporters denied the vote or challenging the eligibility of rivals.</p> <p>Pew is one of the most respected research organisations in the US, and publishes annual updates on the state of the election process.</p> <p>Yesterday's report, Election preview 2008: what if we had an election and everyone came?, says: \"Eight years after the uncovered problems in the 2000 election and more than five years after the creation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, millions of Americans will head to the polls on November 4 in what many are predicting will be the highest-turnout election in recent memory.</p> <p>\"Like the infamous Nor'easter that sank the Andrea Gail, another perfect storm may be brewing, only this one has the potential to combine a record turnout with an insufficient number of poll workers and a voting system still in flux.\"</p> <p>Election officials are struggling in some places to recruit the tens of thousands of extra staff that will be needed.</p> <p>Another problem for election officials is the electronic voting systems introduced in many states after the \"hanging chads\" controversy in Florida in 2000.</p> <p>The report notes that voting machines bought only six years ago have been replaced in Florida, California and other states after officials and Congress became concerned about security and reliability.</p> <p>Some states and counties have returned to paper, but with optical scanners that should theoretically allow for faster counting. This amounts to the third change since 2000.</p> <p>One of the biggest flashpoints is voter registration, particularly in states such as Ohio, Indiana, Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Missouri.</p> <p>Chapin said there is fierce litigation in Indiana and Georgia, where new rules require voters to show photo IDs. Republicans claim this it aimed at preventing vote fraud, while Democrats argue it is a form of voter suppression.</p> <p>The report identifies 11 states where there could be problems on election day, along with Washington DC: Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia.</p> <p>Officials are encouraging early voting and absentee ballots to try to relieve the pressure on November 4.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 23 2008.

  "<p>Hamas is receiving a steady revenue licensing illicit tunnels in Gaza's south to smugglers and business people who are importing fuel and other items from Egypt to meet shortages created by Israel's blockade of the Palestinian territory. </p> <p>Hundreds of tents covering entrances to tunnels - big enough to transport through everything from cows to industrial-size air-conditioners - have mushroomed along Gaza's border with Egypt.</p> <p>Many tunnels are also rigged with plastic pipes, siphoning Egypt's heavily subsidised fuel into Gaza where drivers have had to resort to running their cars on cooking oil because Israel cut petrol, diesel and gas supplies to a bare minimum. </p> <p>One fuel station operator, who did not want to be named, said that in the first 19 days of October he imported 313,000 litres (68,860 gallons) of diesel and 161,500 litres of petrol through the tunnels.</p> <p>\"Every day I send my truck to [the border town of] Rafah,\" he said, adding that he was earning 3.5 shekels (55p) on every litre of Egyptian fuel compared with half a shekel on same amount of Israeli fuel.</p> <p>Israel imposed the blockade to weaken Hamas's control of Gaza after the Islamist group ousted their more secular rival, Fatah, 15 months ago. While the siege has brought the territory's economy to a halt, it has done little to weaken Hamas, which has cashed in on the tunnels' business. </p> <p>Smuggling has become a lucrative and entrenched part of the economy. Omar Shaban, a Gaza economist, estimates that smuggling comprises about 90% of market activity in the territory and is worth around $30m (\u00a318m) to $40m a month.</p> <p>He said: \"The tunnels are integrated into the economy. We have a new economic structure now, a new business community.\"</p> <p>One owner, whose tunnel lies within 200 metres of an Egyptian watchtower, operates 24-hours a day, importing \"everything you can imagine\".</p> <p>Last month, Hamas began charging tunnel owners a 10,000-shekel annual licence fee. Most tunnels are located in Rafah, and its mayor, Issa al-Nashar, said there are now about 400 of them. Other sources, however, estimate the number is closer to 600 - and that the fees comprise 20% of the Rafah municipality's revenue. </p> <p>Nashar said the tunnel owners make $10,000 a day and that he wanted to charge much more. \"But we had a discussion with some of the tunnel owners and we agreed on 10,000 shekels,\" he said.</p> <p>Hamas security forces patrol the tunnels, while the municipality has set up a committee to collect the fees. Rafah also requires the owners to pay 1,000 shekels for electricity and is now pressurising them to sign contracts promising to pay up to $40,000 to the families of tunnel workers killed on the job. Forty people have died working in the sandy, unreinforced underground passages so far this year.</p> <p>In a siege-distorted economy - with an estimated 20% inflation rate, 98% of industry forced to close and unemployment at 45% in the first six months of 2008 - the majority of ordinary Palestinians are yet to benefit.</p> <p>Abu Wajdi is one of around 6,000 workers who have flocked to Rafah in search of a job. He is paid only 900 shekels a month, but says he is risking his life because he is a \"patriot\". \"We are participating in lifting the siege. We are trying to fill the market to meet the needs of our people,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Behind London's Royal Exchange, someone recently created an art installation titled In Loving Memory of the Boom Economy. A mock-up of the roadside shrines that commemorate fatal car accidents, it was sprinkled with faked farewells to company cars and freshly repossessed houses - thereby dramatising two facets of the downturn: the zeitgeisty idea of high rollers plunged into penury; and the way in which events in the markets have been reported by too many overexcited voices - as a quick farewell to the good times with all the shock of a sudden bereavement. </p> <p>On the ground, there's plenty of evidence that the British transition from boom to bust has actually been much slower. As early as March 2003, the Consumer Credit Counselling Service was warning: \"If there is a shock to the economic system then a lot of people are going to get caught out.\" Three years later, it reported that the number of middle-class families (those with at least one member earning more than \u00a330,000 a year) seeking help with debt had almost tripled since 2003, and that this sea change was concentrated in the home counties. </p> <p>This week's big story might be record levels of borrowing by the state, but beyond the irresponsibility of the banks, it's the state of household finances that defines the moment. Including mortgages, collective personal debt in Britain has ballooned to \u00a31.35 trillion: more than the UK's GDP and a figure that brings to mind not so much the debt of the socially excluded but a middle manager in an M25 dormitory town, increasingly aware that the holidays in Orlando and his-and-hers motors are part of an impossible dream. </p> <p>As the downturn bites and fear kicks in, all this is feeding into something remarkable: a quietening of the rhetoric of aspiration and the blurring of social divisions. If as many as two million people are on the dole by Christmas, everything will become even clearer. A kind of social mobility will have returned, with a cruel twist: the momentum will be in the opposite direction to that fretted about by our politicians. </p> <p>One of the most telling aspects of the boom years was the way in which supposed prosperity hardened class divides. The super rich inhabited their own sealed-off orbit, and the advantages of a private education became even more pronounced; the uneasy stand-off between haves and have-nots was symbolised by the accelerated growth of gated private housing developments. Consider also a caricatured dichotomy that still defines too much of the national conversation - the one that separates the property-owning, conspicuously consuming Britons who allegedly want to \"get on\", from the millions who live more precariously, and at least in part depend on benefits. On one side, weekend visits to the shopping centre, \"chav\" jokes and an attachment to Tesco's Finest; on the other, the rattle of small change and regular trips to the local Poundstretcher.</p> <p>Which brings us to a very telling spate of recent news items, and proof that things are changing. At the upper-middle end of the social hierarchy, one thinks of stories of financiers standing sheepishly in jobcentres and parents withdrawing from private education and going back to the state sector (the Sunday Telegraph has anxiously predicted a 5% drop in numbers at private schools, \"which could mean dozens closing\"). Meanwhile, in middle-class lives in which the downturn registers as a matter of quiet worry rather than panicked downsizing, there's the ubiquity of thrift - and the season's endlessly recycled story of the stampede towards discount supermarkets. </p> <p>Focusing on shopping habits while some people talk about great historical turnarounds might seem like frippery, but it shouldn't. In recent years, the big retail chains have carved up the market along class lines, and thereby built inequality into our townscapes. As if to underline the salience of where we do the weekly shop, in the wake of the 2005 election Labour party high-ups began using the names of supermarkets to denote particular kinds of voters: Waitrose people were those who studied school league tables and fed the political class's mania for marketising the public services; Morrisons types were best catered for via shrill messages on crime and immigration and assurances that the state's safety net was intact. Presumably that model has been sidelined: as belts tighten, and the latter chain continues a never-ending promotion it calls the Price Crunch, we may all be Morrisonians now. </p> <p>All this, of course, does not amount to some great moment of national levelling. The language of class will always blare from TVs and newspapers. Still, something is up, and Britons are being nudged closer together by debt, job insecurity, and the realisation that the welfare state has its uses. At a time when so many old certainties are being overturned, you might like to think of it as yet another commonplace being turned on its head: millions of people staring anxiously into a cold and cash-strapped winter, and keeping down with the Joneses.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.harris@theguardian.com\">john.harris@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain's </a>path to the presidency narrowed further today with reports that the Republican was giving up on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colorado\">Colorado</a>, a day after a campaign swing through the battleground state by his running mate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>.</p> <p>The signs of retrenchment for McCain came as a new poll showed Barack Obama steadily increasing his lead since mid-September. </p> <p>The poll, by the Pew Research Centre, gave Obama 52% against 38% for McCain among registered voters, his widest margin yet. Pew said its finding suggested a general lack of confidence for McCain and his judgment.</p> <p>McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate was a key factor in that loss of confidence, as was the Republican's age. </p> <p>The encouraging news for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> arrived on a day when he was consumed by family concerns. The Democrat is to take a 36-hour break from the campaign on Thursday to visit his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/barack-obama-campaign-grandmother-illness\">seriously ill grandmother in Hawaii.</a></p> <p>The first reports that McCain had given up on Colorado were carried by CNN on Monday. \"Gone,\" one adviser said. Other campaign officials, while denying they had given up on the state, told CNN they were lessening their reliance on a win in Colorado to take the White House.</p> <p>The campaign was also downgrading its chances in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iowa\">Iowa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/newmexico\">New Mexico</a>.</p> <p>The Republicans were hoping to hang on to all three states, which George Bush narrowly won in 2004.</p> <p>But with McCain's limited resources against the fundraising juggernaut of the Obama campaign, the Republican has had to make tough decisions on which battlefields to defend.</p> <p>Obama's lead in Colorado is a more modest 5 points, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. But he has a huge advantage over the Republican in organisation, with 51 field offices in Colorado, compared with a dozen for McCain.</p> <p>\"The McCain campaign, having taken public financing, just can't play everywhere now. They don't have the resources to do that,\" said Bule Sewell, a former chair of the Colorado Democratic party.</p> <p>Obama is also outspending McCain by $300,000 (\u00a3177,000) a week on advertising.</p> <p>McCain's hopes of victory rest on holding on to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/virginia\">Virginia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/northcarolina\">North Carolina</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, Missouri and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nevada\">Nevada</a> as well as taking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>. But Obama is even or ahead of McCain in the first seven states and has a 12-point lead in the last.</p> <p>Campaign officials today tried to douse speculation McCain was pulling the plug on Colorado, where Democrats believe that the Republican could be swamped at the polls by the enthusiasm among younger voters and Latinos. However, such decisions are usually kept secret. Last month, McCain faced severe criticism for announcing he was pulling out of Michigan, another battleground.</p> <p>Palin made three campaign stops on Monday in Colorado and McCain is due there on Friday. But the campaign has barely had any advertising presence on radio or television in the state.</p> <p>\"We see the race tightening both internally and in public polling,\" said Jill Hazelbaker, his national communications director. \"We are within striking distance in the key battleground states we need to win.\"</p> <p>Michelle Obama will take a turn as the Democratic headliner on Friday, while her husband is in Hawaii. She is to make campaign stops in Akron and Columbus, Ohio. Her husband is cancelling a rally in Iowa and Wisconsin to visit his grandmother.</p> <p>Obama's absence is unlikely to hurt his campaign. In a campaign of this magnitude and duration, it is not clear how much personal appearances boost a candidate so close to polling day.</p> <p>Obama could also get a sympathy boost for taking time out to visit his white grandmother, Madleyn Dunham, 85. It allows him to demonstrate a commitment to family. He was largely brought up by her.</p> <p>His campaign released photographs of a young Obama with Dunham on his graduation from high school.</p>",
  "<p>On Sunday I was invited to dinner with my partner in the Maryland suburbs of Washington DC. We were alerted in advance this enclave might feel a bit foreign \u2013 meaning that, unlike most of downtown DC, this family was solidly Republican. Indeed, a McCain-Palin lawn sign stood firmly planted in their lawn, the family minivan was plastered with McCain-Palin stickers and the hostess wore a <a href=\"http://www.aspendesigns.com/mccain-pins.html\">McCain-Palin pin</a>.</p> <p>There was no reason to comment: the atmosphere was convivial and friendly, the conversation meandered for nearly two hours before it rolled around to the election. But when it did come up - one guest at the dinner party sheepishly admitted he had forgotten to register to vote, which in the Washington metropolitan area is akin to forgetting to enroll a child in school - the conversation took an uncomfortable turn. What followed was more anthropological than intellectual. Rather than a nuanced conversation on campaign strategy, or policy decisions, this was a clash of civilizations. The hostess demanded the table to provide \"one single reason to vote for Obama\". Her rhetoric \u2013 and tone \u2013 began to rise. I held my tongue (very unusual for me), as I didn't know the family. <br> This was the grinding sound of the two Americas sliding up against each other like tectonic plates. The whole interaction was unsettling. It's one thing to flip over to Fox News, or laugh at Sarah Palin impersonations. It's another to consider how deep the fissures in the country still are - Colin Powell's endorsement of Obama not withstanding. On the way out, as the hostess kissed us goodbye, she said: \"May the best man win.\" And then she couldn't resist a final twist. \"Good luck,\" she said, \"in your socialist country if it's your side that wins.\"  What is this new nefarious trope of socialism? It's come up recently in Sarah Palin's rallies \u2013 in Roswell, New Mexico, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/10/19/politics/fromtheroad/entry4531388.shtml\">Palin raised the spectre</a> around the false character of Joe the Plumber: \"Senator Obama said he wants to, quote, spread the wealth. What that means is he wants government to take your money and dole it out however a politician sees fit,\" she said, \"But Joe the Plumber and Ed the Dairy Man, I believe that they think that it sounds more like socialism\u2026. Friends, now is no time to experiment with socialism.\"</p> <p>Later, at a press session in Colorado, Palin defended her comments. \"There are socialist principles to that, yes,\" Palin said, referring to Obama's tax proposals. \"Taking more from a small business or small business owners or from a hard-working families and then redistributing that money according to a politician's priorities - there are hints of socialism in there and that's why I don't fault or discredit Joe the Plumber for bringing that up, asking if that is socialism.\" Socialism has become another code word like \"liberal,\" for being \"anti-American.\" In the Palin universe, there is nothing between libertarianism and anti-Americanism. Government projects are \"socialist\". It's clear she hasn't spent much time in Europe. <br> Two days earlier, Michele Bachman - a Republican representative from Minnesota (not a state known for conservatism) - all but called for a <a href=\" http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/huac.htm \">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> to investigate into the actions of her colleagues in the House of Representatives. Chattering on to <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" ejiqm_7yaui\" \">Chris Matthews </a> about the \"troika\" of \"liberal\" and \"anti-American\" representatives and Senators who should be the subject of a \"penetrating expose\" by the media to find out who is truly pro-American. (and in the days since it's become clear she's subsequently dulled own <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/31261989.html\">chances of re-election</a> this fall) <br> This is all very worrisome. Beyond Bachman's dehistoricized, blithe call to grill her colleagues on their patriotism, do these politicians really believe that government officials are <em>anti</em> American? The continuation of this trend towards whipping up Americans to distrust other Americans will fester long after this election is over.</p>",

Election officials fear trouble because of passions aroused by the election, by long queues or by people being told they are not eligible to vote.</p> <p>Doug Chapin, director of Pew's electionline.org, said: \"People talk about meltdown. It is undeniable that the election system is going to face its biggest-ever test.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It is over-optimistic to think that 130m people can vote and something does not go wrong ... We have spent eight years sorting the plumbing but on November 4 we are going to crank up the system.\"</p> <p>The pressure is mainly because the excitement created by Barack Obama could result in a record turnout, with African Americans and young voters, both traditionally notorious for failing to vote, predicted to cast ballots in large numbers this time round.</p> <p>New voters are registering in record numbers in almost every state.</p> <p>Election officials in Virginia recently ordered 200,000 additional voter registration forms.</p> <p>Thousands of lawyers are being recruited by Obama and John McCain to police the polling booths, offering advice to supporters denied the vote or to challenge the eligibility of rivals.</p> <p>Pew is one of the most respected research organisations in the US, and<br>publishes annual updates on the state of the election process.</p> <p>Today's report, Election Preview 2008: What if we had an election and everyone came?, says: \"Eight years after the uncovered problems in the 2000 election and more than five years after the creation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, millions of Americans will head to the polls on November 4 in what many are predicting will be the highest turnout election in recent memory.</p> <p>\"Like the infamous Nor'easter that sank the Andrea Gail, another perfect storm may be brewing, only this one has the potential to combine a record turnout with an insufficient number of poll workers and a voting system still in flux.\"</p> <p>Election officials are struggling in some places to recruit the tens of thousands of extra staff that will be needed.</p> <p>Another problem for election officials is the electronic voting systems introduced in many states after the \"hanging chads\" mess in Florida in 2000.</p> <p>The report notes that voting machines bought only six years ago have been replaced in Florida, California and other states after election officials and Congress became concerned about security and reliability.</p> <p>Some states and counties have returned to paper, but with optical scanners that should theoretically allow for faster counting. This amounts to the third change since 2000.</p> <p>One of the biggest flashpoints is voter registration, particularly in states such as Ohio, Indiana, Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Missouri.</p> <p>Chapin said there is fierce litigation in Indiana and Georgia, where recently-adopted rules require voters to show photo IDs. Republicans claim this it aimed at preventing voter fraud, while Demococrats argue that it is a form of voter suppression.</p> <p>There is also conflict over whether students can vote in the counties where they are attending university or whether they should be registered in their home states.</p> <p>Chapin said that one of the reasons why elections were such an issue in the US was that, unlike other democracies where organisation is done centrally, they are handled at state and county level.</p> <p>The report identifies 12 states where there could be problems on election day because of lack of poll workers, new voting machines or voter registration rows: Washington DC, Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia.</p> <p>Officials are encouraging early voting and absentee ballots to try to relieve the pressure on November 4.</p>",
  "<p>The \"theft of wardrobe doors\" scenario has, apparently, become a familiar tale among extradition lawyers. The story goes like this: carpenter fits wardrobe doors, his client fails to pay, so the carpenter removes the wardrobe doors. </p> <p>Such a chain of events would be unlikely to trouble the UK's criminal courts. Or anyone, frankly. Even if the disgruntled client were to press charges against the obstinate carpenter, and even if there were evidence that wardrobe doors had indeed been removed against their owner's will, the Crown Prosecution Service would still have to apply the test of whether it served the public interest to prosecute. Uprooting the honest carpenter with no history of offending from his hardworking family life over a dispute about payment would be unlikely to pass.</p> <p>If, however, the events took place in Poland and the carpenter was a Polish national now living in Britain, a different ending emerges. Under the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm\">European Arrest Warrant</a> system (EAW), EU members including the UK now extradite citizens of other member states back to where they came from with few questions asked. The idea is to simplify criminal proceedings within the EU, the presumption being that, from one European human rights-bound state to another, suspected criminals will surely receive humane treatment and a fair trial on their return. </p> <p>In some cases, this has happened. The UK has been able to extradite foreign suspects wanted for serious crimes in other EU countries. Similarly UK citizens at large in the EU zone have been returned for investigation into crimes at home. </p> <p>Less predictable, however, has been Poland's use of the EAW to request a breathtaking number of extraditions for cases described by judges and lawyers alike as trivial. By \"trivial\", they mean <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/20/immigration-extradition-poland-lithuania-law\">allegations</a> of theft relating to wardrobe doors, a pedal bike, or a dessert. Each case requires specialist extradition agents from Scotland Yard, extradition solicitors, barristers, interpreters and precious court time before one of only five judges in the country able to hear extradition cases. The Metropolitan Police have had to start chartering regular planes back to Poland just to cope.</p> <p>The explanation for this seemingly bizarre use of state time and resources lies in the Polish system of \"compulsory prosecution\" or <em>zasada legalizmu</em>. All allegations of crime in Poland must be investigated, and once reasonable suspicion has been established, all offences must be prosecuted. Investigation requires the presence of the suspect and, if the suspect has made his way to the UK, extradition is required.</p> <p>Harmonisation of criminal justice systems within the EU is a long way off and in the meantime Poland is entitled to its own system of charge and prosecution. Nevertheless, this apparent clash of attitudes towards prosecution is having a very clear effect. The British courts are struggling to cope. The sheer number of Polish extradition cases, a \"huge volume\" of which, according to the Met Police, relate to the kind of one-off, minor offences that would not be pursued had they taken place here, seems wildly disproportionate. </p> <p>But more than that, these cases raise questions about the principle of an extradition system based on \"mutual trust\" \u2013 described by a judge as \"the important underlying assumption ... that member states, sharing common values and recognising common rights, can and should trust the integrity and fairness of each other's judicial systems\". </p> <p>Although Polish law is apparently proving the most annoying challenge to this doctrine, it is my no means the most serious. Other former members of the Eastern bloc have been working hard to push the concept of \"mutual trust\" to its absolute limit. Bulgaria and Latvia, for example, have repeatedly been accused of violating basic human rights standards by providing detention facilities with no exercise or natural light, no toilet facilities except a bucket shared among numerous detainees, infestations of fleas and scabies and food shared with mice and rats. </p> <p>Poland does not stand accused of violating rights on this scale. It is simply flooding the courts at a time when they are already struggling to cope with a massive shortfall in funding \u2013 a situation which looks unlikely to improve in the near future. In the era of \"tough choices\", do we really want to persist in extraditing Poles for stealing desserts? And if so, at what cost?</p>",
  "<p>There are perhaps not a few citizens of the world disappointed that there have been no credible sightings of erstwhile Masters of the Universe defenestrating themselves from the Temples of Mammon on Wall Street. One reason could be that the windows are now sealed and air-conditioned, offering no access to the ledges.</p> <p>The other could be that they have looted the \"pre-need\" funeral plans that would pay for their interment. Last month, a little-noticed casualty of the financial crisis was National Prearranged Services, which <a href=\"http://www.katesboylston.com/NewsPage.aspx?newsID=1437\">shuffled off</a> its corporate coil, leaving in doubt some 200,000 customers who had paid in advance \"pre-need\" for what the industry equally coyly calls \"end of life\" services.</p> <p>Another organisation in Colorado, the Neptune Society was <a href=\"http://www.katesboylston.com/NewsPage.aspx?newsID=1451\">charged with skimming the funds</a> this month.</p> <p>Paul Krugman took time off from dusting off his tux for the Nobels to make <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/in-the-long-run-we-are-all-dead/\">tangential reference to the connection between the death industry and the credit crisis</a> in his blog. He cites the very conservative Daily Mail inveighing against the British labour government because the credit crunch has made it slow in paying out funeral grants to the families of <br>the impoverished deceased. It highlights the decadence of a welfare state for American conservatives \u2013 socialised death care as well as healthcare \u2013 no wonder the British Empire fell!</p> <p>I should declare an interest. I once wrote a column advocating \"synergistic dialectical investing\" and as a joke invested my annual <br>pension contribution in <a href=\"http://www.sci-corp.com/SCICORP/home.aspx\">Service Corporation International</a>, the world's biggest chain of funeral homes, and <a href=\"http://www.philipmorrisinternational.com/pmintl/pages/eng/default.asp\">Philip Morris</a>, on the grounds that death and taxes are inevitable, and tobacco would help them both along.</p> <p>As an investment, the joke has paid off six-fold, but SCI has not done as well as I anticipated. This month the credit crunch <a href=\"http://www.katesboylston.com/NewsPage.aspx?newsID=1452\">killed off its takeover bid</a> for the second biggest chain of morticians, Stewart.</p> <p>From cradle to grave, the credit bust has no end of ramifications. Overcoming it will be a stiff task.</p> <p>It raises the question about the billions of dollars put aside pre-need by Americans in the confident expectation that it will pay for them to be gutted, pickled in toxic fluids and sealed in expensive caskets with (as I recall in one trade publication) \"a lifetime guarantee\".</p> <p>Can they really trust the finance industry not to assume that since you cannot take it with you, we may as well take it from you now? Hoping that someone will follow in my footsteps when we did a quick and clean funeral for my father (at his request), it is not an issue that deeply concerns me, except for the environmental consequences of stuffing sealed toxic capsules below ground in a country where millions are dependent on wells tapping the ground water.</p> <p>However in the public interest I approached the <a href=\"http://www.fea.org/\">Funeral Ethics Association</a> whose Lisa Carlson advised pre-needers not to bother, \"unless you are reducing assets to the level to get Medicare\". Better to plan ahead she said, while her organisation also advocates cheaper, greener, DIY burials - where the law allows.</p> <p>The death industry in the United States has lobbyists almost as tenacious as Wall Street's in Washington. Embalming, morticians, concrete vaults and all sorts of expensive ghoulish accoutrements are compulsory in different states. Carlson herself is being <a href=\"http://www.katesboylston.com/NewsPage.aspx?newsID=1427\">sued</a> by Thomas Lynch, author and poet of the mortuary slab for comments she has made about the industry and his business.</p> <p>Ms Carlson does not say so, of course, but if you are not worried about funeral costs, those who are about to die can happily run up huge credit card charges and leave them swinging for the bailiffs to try to shake down the urn afterwards. Now that is real pre-need planning. But do be careful. My father tried it, and paid an insurance premium on his Visa card. They noticed and came a-knocking.</p>",
  "<p>The US environmental movement is failing \u2013 by any measure, the state of the earth has never been more dire. What's needed, a leading environmentalist writes, is a new, inclusive green politics that challenges basic assumptions about consumerism and unlimited growth.</p> <p>All of us who have been part of the environmental movement in the United States must now face up to a deeply troubling paradox: Our environmental organizations have grown in strength and sophistication, but the environment has continued to go downhill, to the point that the prospect of a ruined planet is now very real. How could this have happened?</p> <p>Before addressing this question and what can be done to correct it, two points must be made. First, one shudders to think what the world would look like today without the efforts of environmental groups and their hard-won victories in recent decades. However serious our environmental challenges, they would be much more so had not these people taken a stand in countless ways. And second, despite their limitations, the approaches of modern-day environmentalism remain essential: Right now, they are the tools readily at hand with which to address many pressing problems, including global warming and climate disruption. Despite the critique of American environmentalism that follows, these points remain valid.</p> <h2>Lost ground</h2> <p>The need for appraisal would not be so urgent if environmental conditions were not so dire. The mounting threats point to an emerging environmental tragedy of unprecedented proportions.</p> <p>Half the world's tropical and temperate forests are now gone. The rate of deforestation in the tropics continues at about an acre a second, and has for decades. Half the planet's wetlands are gone. An estimated 90 percent of the large predator fish are gone, and 75 percent of marine fisheries are now overfished or fished to capacity. Almost half of the corals are gone or are seriously threatened. Species are disappearing at rates about 1,000 times faster than normal. The planet has not seen such a spasm of extinction in 65 million years, since the dinosaurs disappeared. Desertification claims a Nebraska-sized area of productive capacity each year globally. Persistent toxic chemicals can now be found by the dozens in essentially each and every one of us.</p> <p>The earth's stratospheric ozone layer was severely depleted before its loss was discovered. Human activities have pushed atmospheric carbon dioxide up by more than a third and have started in earnest the most dangerous change of all \u2014 planetary warming and climate disruption. Everywhere, earth's ice fields are melting. Industrial processes are fixing nitrogen, making it biologically active, at a rate equal to nature's; one result is the development of hundreds of documented dead zones in the oceans due to overfertilization. Freshwater withdrawals are now over half of accessible runoff, and water shortages are multiplying here and abroad.</p> <p>The United States, of course, is deeply complicit in these global trends, including our responsibility for about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide added thus far to the atmosphere. But even within the United States itself, four decades of environmental effort have not stemmed the tide of environmental decline. The country is losing 6,000 acres of open space every day, and 100,000 acres of wetlands every year. About a third of U.S. plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. Half of U.S. lakes and a third of its rivers still fail to meet the standards that by law should have been met by 1983. And we have done little to curb our wasteful energy habits or our huge population growth.</p> <p>Here is one measure of the problem: All we have to do to destroy the planet's climate and biota and leave a ruined world to our children and grandchildren is to keep doing exactly what we are doing today, with no growth in human population or the world economy. Just continue to generate greenhouse gases at current rates, just continue to impoverish ecosystems and release toxic chemicals at current rates, and the world in the latter part of this century won't be fit to live in. But human activities are not holding at current levels \u2013 they are accelerating, dramatically.</p> <p>The size of the world economy has more than quadrupled since 1960 and is projected to quadruple again by mid-century. It took all of human history to grow the $7 trillion world economy of 1950. We now grow by that amount in a decade.</p> <p>The escalating processes of climate disruption, biotic impoverishment, and toxification, which continue despite decades of warnings and earnest effort, constitute a severe indictment of the system of political economy in which we live and work. The pillars of today's capitalism, as they are now constituted, work together to produce an economic and political reality that is highly destructive environmentally. </p> <p>Powerful corporate interests whose overriding objective is to grow by generating profit (including profit from avoiding the environmental costs their companies create, amassing deep subsidies and benefits from government, and continued deployment of technologies originally designed with little or no regard for the environment); markets that systematically fail to recognize environmental costs unless corrected by government; government that is subservient to corporate interests and the growth imperative; rampant consumerism spurred by sophisticated advertising and marketing; economic activity now so large in scale that its impacts alter the fundamental biophysical operations of the planet \u2014 all combine to deliver an ever-growing world economy that is undermining the ability of the earth to sustain life.</p> <h2>Are environmentalists to blame?</h2> <p>In assigning responsibility for environmental failure, there are many places to lay blame: the rise of the modern, anti-government right in American politics; a negligent media; the deadening complexity of today's environmental issues and programs, to mention the most notable. But a number of observers have placed much of the blame for failure on the leading environmental organizations themselves.</p> <p>For example, Mark Dowie in his 1995 book Losing Ground notes that the national environmental organizations crafted an agenda and pursued a strategy based on the civil authority and good faith of the federal government. \"Therein,\" he believes, \"lies the inherent weakness and vulnerability of the environmental movement. Civil authority and good faith regarding the environment have proven to be chimeras in Washington.\" Dowie argues that the national environmental groups also \"misread and underestimate[d] the fury of their antagonists.\"</p> <p>The mainstream environmental organizations were challenged again in 2004 in the now-famous The Death of Environmentalism. In it, Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus write that America's mainstream environmentalists are not \"articulating a vision of the future commensurate with the magnitude of the crisis. Instead they are promoting technical policy fixes like pollution controls and higher vehicle mileage standards \u2014 proposals that provide neither the popular inspiration nor the political alliances the community needs to deal with the problem.\" </p> <p>Shellenberger and Nordhaus believe environmentalists don't recognize that they are in a culture war \u2014 a war over core values and a vision for the future.</p> <p>These criticisms and others stem from the fundamental decision of today's environmentalism to work within the system. This core decision grew out of the successes of the environmental community in the 1970s, which seemed to confirm the correctness of that approach. Our failure to execute a dramatic mid-course correction when circumstances changed can be seen in hindsight as a major blunder.</p> <p>Here is what I mean by working within the system. When today's environmentalism recognizes a problem, it believes it can solve that problem by calling public attention to it, framing policy and program responses for government and industry, lobbying for those actions, and litigating for their enforcement. It believes in the efficacy of environmental advocacy and government action. It believes that good-faith compliance with the law will be the norm, and that corporations can be made to behave and will increasingly weave environmental objectives into their business strategies.</p> <p>Today's environmentalism tends to be pragmatic and incrementalist \u2014 its actions are aimed at solving problems and often doing so one at a time. It is more comfortable proposing innovative policy solutions than framing inspirational messages. These characteristics are closely allied to a tendency to deal with effects rather than underlying causes. Most of our major environmental laws and treaties, for example, address the resulting environmental ills much more than their causes. In the end, environmentalism accepts compromises as part of the process. It takes what it can get.</p> <p>Today's environmentalism also believes that problems can be solved at acceptable economic costs \u2014 and often with net economic benefit \u2014 without significant lifestyle changes or threats to economic growth. It will not hesitate to strike out at an environmentally damaging facility or development, but it sees itself, on balance, as a positive economic force.</p> <p>Environmentalists see solutions coming largely from within the environmental sector. They may worry about the flaws in and corruption of our politics, for example, but that is not their professional concern. That's what Common Cause or other groups do. Similarly, environmentalists know that the prices for many things need to be higher, and they are aware that environmentally honest prices would create a huge burden on the half of American families that just get by. But universal health care and other government action needed to address America's gaping economic injustices are not seen as part of the environmental agenda.</p> <p>Today's environmentalism is also not focused strongly on political activity or organizing a grassroots movement. Electoral politics and mobilizing a green political movement have played second fiddle to lobbying, litigating, and working with government agencies and corporations.</p> <p>A central precept, in short, is that the system can be made to work for the environment. In this frame of action, scant attention is paid to the corporate dominance of economic and political life, to transcending our growth fetish, to promoting major lifestyle changes and challenging the materialistic values that dominate our society, to addressing the constraints on environmental action stemming from America's vast social insecurity and hobbled democracy, to framing a new American story, or to building a new environmental politics.</p> <p>Not everything, of course, fits within these patterns. There have been exceptions from the start, and recent trends reflect a broadening in approaches. Greenpeace has certainly worked outside the system, the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club have had a sustained political presence, groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund have developed effective networks of activists around the country, the World Resources Institute has augmented its policy work with on-the-ground sustainable development projects, and environmental justice concerns and the emerging climate crisis have spurred the proliferation of grassroots efforts, student organizing, and community and state initiatives.</p> <p>But organizations that were built to litigate and lobby for environmental causes or to do sophisticated policy studies are not necessarily the best ones to mobilize a grassroots movement or build a force for electoral politics or motivate the public with social marketing campaigns. These things need to be done, and to get them done it may be necessary to launch new organizations and initiatives with special strengths in these areas.</p> <p>The methods and style of today's environmentalism are not wrongheaded, just far, far too restricted as an overall approach. The problem has been the absence of a huge, complementary investment of time, energy, and money in other, deeper approaches to change. And here, the leading environmental organizations must be faulted for not doing nearly enough to ensure these investments were made.</p> <p>America has run a 40-year experiment on whether this mainstream environmentalism can succeed, and the results are now in. The full burden of managing accumulating environmental threats has fallen to the environmental community, both those in government and outside. But that burden is too great. The system of modern capitalism as it operates today will continue to grow in size and complexity and will generate ever-larger environmental consequences, outstripping efforts to cope with them. Indeed, the system will seek to undermine those efforts and constrain them within narrow limits. Working only within the system will, in the end, not succeed \u2014 what is needed is transformative change in the system itself.</p> <h2>Environmental protection requires a new politics</h2> <p>This new politics must, first of all, ensure that environmental concern and advocacy extend to the full range of relevant issues. The environmental agenda should expand to embrace a profound challenge to consumerism and commercialism and the lifestyles they offer, a healthy skepticism of growthmania and a redefinition of what society should be striving to grow, a challenge to corporate dominance and a redefinition of the corporation and its goals, a commitment to deep change in both the functioning and the reach of the market, and a powerful assault on the anthropocentric and contempocentric values that currently dominate.</p> <p>Environmentalists must also join with social progressives in addressing the crisis of inequality now unraveling America's social fabric and undermining its democracy. It is a crisis of soaring executive pay, huge incomes, and increasingly concentrated wealth for a small minority, occurring simultaneously with poverty near a 30-year high, stagnant wages despite rising productivity, declining social mobility and opportunity, record levels of people without health insurance, failing schools, increased job insecurity, swelling jails, shrinking safety nets, and the longest work hours among the rich countries. In an America with such vast social insecurity, economic arguments, even misleading ones, will routinely trump environmental goals.</p> <p>Similarly, environmentalists must join with those seeking to reform politics and strengthen democracy. What we are seeing in the United States is the emergence of a vicious circle: income disparities and influence to wealthy constituencies and large businesses, which further imperils the potential of the democratic process to act to correct the growing income disparities. Corporations have been the principal economic actors for a long time; now they are the principal political actors as well. Neither environment nor society fares well under corporatocracy. Environmentalists need to embrace public financing of elections, regulation of lobbying, nonpartisan Congressional redistricting, and other political reform measures as core to their agenda. Today's politics will never deliver environmental sustainability.</p> <p>The current financial crisis and, at this writing, the response to it, reveal a system of political economy that is profoundly committed to profits and growth and profoundly indifferent to people and society. This system is at least as indifferent to its impacts on nature. Left uncorrected, it is inherently ruthless and rapacious, and it is up to citizens, acting mainly through government, to inject values of fairness and sustainability into the system. But this effort commonly fails because progressive politics are too enfeebled and Washington is increasingly in the hands of powerful corporate interests and concentrations of great wealth. The best hope for real change in America is a fusion of those concerned about environment, social justice, and strong democracy into one powerful progressive force.</p> <p>The new environmentalism must work with this progressive coalition to build a mighty force in electoral politics. This will require major efforts at grassroots organizing; strengthening groups working at the state and community levels; and developing motivational messages and appeals \u2014 indeed, writing a new American story, as Bill Moyers has urged. Our environmental discourse has thus far been dominated by lawyers, scientists, and economists. Now, we need to hear a lot more from the poets, preachers, philosophers, and psychologists.</p> <p><em>James Gustave Speth is author of The Bridge at the End of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability and dean of the Yale University School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies.

  "<p>The momentum of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>'s presidential campaign has penetrated Republican heartlands and led to a growing number of once-safe red states being considered winnable.</p> <p>Obama's legions of volunteers and campaign staff have made deep inroads in North Dakota and Missouri - states that have not voted to put a Democrat in the White House since 1964 and 1996 respectively.</p> <p>Polling in North Dakota, a sparsely populated prairie state with a rugged frontier conservatism, puts Obama in a dead heat with his Republican rival, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>.</p> <p>In Missouri - a much older state with large metropolitan areas around St Louis and Kansas City and a rural white conservative base - Obama has edged ahead of McCain in seven out of 10 major polls since early October. The most recent, released yesterday by Fox/Rasmussen, shows him at 49% to McCain's 44%.</p> <p>Should Obama's lead in Missouri and North Dakota hold, their combined 14 electoral votes would give Obama a strategic cushion in the electoral college and free up some of his campaign war chest for spending elsewhere. If Obama wins these states he will enter office with a strong national mandate for his policies.</p> <p>\"It's mathematically irrelevant,\" says the liberal blogger and Democratic internet organising pioneer Markos Moulitsas Zuniga of North Dakota. \"But politically it would be huge. It would show Republicans that they aren't safe anywhere, not even in their supposed strongholds.\"</p> <p>Polls indicate Obama has won support for his plans to handle the economic crisis. He has a large advantage over McCain in campaign funds and volunteers, enabling him to buy more advertising, staff the telephones and send people doorknocking for support.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Obama juggernaut has overwhelmed long-held assumptions about the viability of a Democratic candidate in states like North Dakota, Virginia and North Carolina. In 2000, the Democratic presidential geographical base was limited to the liberal north-east and west coasts, and the traditionally progressive states of the upper mid-west.</p> <p>In 2004, John Kerry lost ground, ceding New Mexico and Iowa to George Bush, and Democrats feared that the Republican party's appeal to culturally conservative voters had crystallised, locking out the Democrats from large swathes of the south and mid-west.</p> <p>Obama won the Democratic nomination in part on a promise to redraw the electoral map with his appeal to young voters, blacks and independents sick of Bush Republicanism. He was aided by efforts of the Democratic party's chairman, Howard Dean, who pledged to revive dormant party organisations in conservative states like Oklahoma.</p> <p>Obama has been helped by his long and bitter primary battle with Hillary Clinton. By the time he staggered over the finish line in June, he had built massive volunteer organisations in Republican states such as North Carolina. Once he had the nomination secured, his campaign redirected these resources to the general election battle with McCain. Democrats registered hundreds of thousands of new voters across the country.</p> <p>At first, the election race seemed to follow the geographic groove cut by Bush and his successive opponents Al Gore and Kerry, with the fiercest battlegrounds in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>But it soon became clear Obama was competitive in Colorado and New Mexico, where he has maintained a substantial polling lead boosted by his popularity with Hispanic voters. By mid-September, when the US banking system appeared on the verge of collapse, Obama had pulled ahead in Virginia and was pressuring McCain in North Carolina.</p>",
  "<p>China today issued a wanted list of eight alleged terrorists, calling for their arrest and extradition for plotting attacks on the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>A spokesman for the public security ministry said the men, all Chinese citizens, were members of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which seeks independence for the restive north-western region of Xinjiang.</p> <p>The region saw its worst violence for years in August, with 33 people killed in a spate of attacks around and during the games. No one claimed responsibility but China blamed Uighur separatists. Muslim Uighurs make up around half of Xinjiang's population and many object to religious restrictions and Han Chinese immigration.</p> <p>Before the Olympics, security officials claimed to have foiled planned attacks. Few details were given of the alleged activities of the men named today.</p> <p>\"The eight are all key members of the ETIM, and all participated in the planning, deployment and execution of all kinds of violent terrorist activities targeting the Beijing Olympics,\" said Wu Heping, a spokesman with the ministry of public security.</p> <p>He gave no indication of where the men might be, but called on foreign countries to arrest and extradite them to China, adding that they posed a threat to security and stability across the region as well as domestically.</p> <p>The list identified 37-year-old Memetiming Memeti as the head of ETIM. Another man has the alias Saifula, which was used in a videotaped message released in July, in which a group calling itself the Turkestan Islamic Party threatened anti-Olympic attacks.

So when the New Mexico Republican Party <a href=\"http://www.koat.com/politics/17736001/detail.html\">announced</a> that it had found evidence of 28 possibly fraudulent votes being cast in a local Democratic primary earlier this year, it was a serious claim. The National Review's Jim Geraghty was particularly scathing about one of the obviously made-up names of the fake voters: \"Duran Duran.\" \"The person who is 'Duran Duran',\" he <a href=\"http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MzBjMzc0ZmRhMzI4OTY0ZTg1MmNjOTBkYTBlYTkxZTU=\">wrote</a>, \"almost certainly voted under their real name, and thus got two votes in the primary.\" But then ACORN produced evidence that the 28 voters in question were real, and the New Mexico GOP <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/rnc_on_new_mexico_voter_fraud.php\">abruptly backed off</a>. Because it <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/right-wing_pundit_on_voter_fra.php\">turns out</a> that there really is a Duran Duran <a href=\"http://www.whitepages.com/search/FindPerson?extra_listing=mixed&amp;form_mode=opt_b&amp;post_back=1&amp;firstname_begins_with=1&amp;firstname=duran&amp;name=duran&amp;street=&amp;city_zip=albuquerque&amp;state_id=NM&amp;localtime=survey\">listed in the Albuquerque phonebook</a>. Even so, Republican anti-fraud operatives expect to spend election day in New Mexico keeping an eye out for bad Eighties blow-drys and people wearing blazers with the sleeves rolled up, since they're all too aware that DD bassist John Taylor has <a href=\"http://blogs.tampabay.com/80s/2008/10/duran-duran-lov.html\">already pledged his support for Obama</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Until recently, oligarch was a byword for Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea FC. </p> <p>But over the last 12 months, Oleg Deripaska, a 40-year-old metals tycoon, has dominated the headlines. </p> <p>According to Forbes magazine, in May he overtook Abramovich as Russia's richest man, with a $28.6bn (\u00a316.8bn) fortune. </p> <p>His extraordinary wealth is based on the ownership of the world's leading aluminium company.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian last year, he shrugged off the suggestion he was very well off. Asked how much he was worth, he replied: \"I don't know.\" Recently, he has been a high-profile victim of the credit crisis.</p> <p>Deripaska's friendship with British politicians has placed him at the centre of controversy. He has met the business secretary, Peter Mandelson, when Mandelson was the EU's trade commissioner. </p> <p>Moscow's Pushkin cafe, an elite pre-revolutionary restaurant favoured by Russia's elite, was one dinner venue.</p> <p>Also present, according to a political blog written by Mandelson's former special adviser Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, was Nathaniel Rothschild, a friend not only of Mandelson but of the shadow chancellor, George Osborne. </p> <p>According to today's Times newspaper, Rothschild says Deripaska entertained Osborne on his yacht in Corfu last summer. </p> <p>Andrew Feldman, the Tory party's chief fundraiser, was there. Feldman tried to solicit a \u00a350,000 donation for the Tories from Deripaska, it is alleged, though this is denied.</p> <p>Deripaska had his multi-entry visa revoked by the US in mid-2006. He has been involved in legal cases in the US, and in Britain a former business partner, Michael Cherney, is suing him in the high court.</p> <p>The cases date back the 90s. It was then, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, that a new class of businessmen - the oligarchs - ruthlessly carved up the country's newly privatised state industries. </p> <p>Deripaska was involved in the struggle for control of an aluminium plant in Sayanogorsk, Siberia, which became part of privatisation legend, described as the \"aluminium wars\". </p> <p>He dismisses claims that at one point his enemies tried to blow him up on a mountain road using a grenade launcher.</p> <p>Like many super-wealthy Russians, Deripaska is an Anglophile. He has a \u00a320m house in Belgravia and speaks fluent idiomatic English, learned when he studied at Moscow state university. his young son and daughter have mastered the language, thanks to their English nanny.</p> <p>He has business interests in the UK: in 2006 his investment company, Basic Element, bought the ailing British van-maker LDV.</p> <p>Deripaska has no plans to live in Britain, and has denied rumours he was at one point interested in buying Arsenal. \"It's not my thing,\" he said of football last year.</p> <p>Like many oligarchs, he came from humble origins, growing up in a small rural village in southern Russia with his widowed mother, an engineer. </p> <p>By 1993-94, he had accumulated a 20% stake in a Siberian aluminium factory. </p> <p>In 2000, Abramovich bought most of the holdings in Russia's aluminium industry and merged them with Deripaska's company. They created Rusal - Russian aluminium. Abramovich later sold his stake to Deripaska, leaving him the biggest player in one of the world's most lucrative industries.</p> <p>Deripaska has shown an uncanny knack for cultivating the rich, powerful and important. He is well connected inside Russia: in 2001 he married Polina Yumasheva, the daughter of Boris Yeltsin's powerful chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev, who is married to the late president's younger daughter, Tatyana. </p> <p>Deripaska is very close to Vladimir Putin, Russia's powerful prime minister.</p> <p>What is unclear is why Deripaska would want to cultivate the Tories - even assuming that they will form the next government. </p> <p>In his Guardian interview, Deripaska made it clear that Britain was of little strategic interest to him. His global empire, he explained, was based on smelters, hydro-electric dams and cheap Siberian power. \"I'm dealing with industrial things, and Britain is a post-industrial economy,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>I didn't really have a horse in the Boston-Tampa series, and I don't watch baseball until the playoffs. So Sunday night was the first time I saw David Price in action. The rookie Tampa Bay Rays relief pitcher got his team out of a jam, striking out Jason Varitek among other accomplishments, and preserving TB's victory and ascent to the World Series against Philly.</p> <p>As I watched Price, I thought: This guy is the Obama of baseball. He's young, gamine, in a light-skinned black man (might even be bi-racial), \"inexperienced,\" but cool as an ice cube under pressure.</p> <p>Then lo and behold, what happened yesterday? Obama had an event in Tampa where <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/other/10/21/1021davidprice.html\">he was introduced by...David Price!</a> Life's always interesting.<br></p>",
  "<p>Why is the politics of immigration such a mess?. Yesterday <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Woolas\">Phil Woolas</a>, Britain's new immigration minister, sat beside his Dutch opposite number and said that immigration policy needs a rigorous counting in and counting out of everyone who enters Britain. His Dutch colleague would have been bemused as it is impossible to count who enters and leaves the Netherlands because there are no longer any borders there. Even if Europe gave up on the free flow of people and tried to reintroduce stringent frontier controls it still would not work.</p> <p>When I worked in Geneva 25 years ago at a time when passports were checked at main borders there were still dozens of small roads going from France into Switzerland which had no permanent border checks on them. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement\">Schengen</a> \u2013 the system that allows Europeans to move about freely \u2013 was introduced not in a fit of Euroliberalism but because the system of trying to stop and examine the papers of every car, lorry, bike, or walker crossing the hundreds of thousands border roads of Europe had become impossible.Today most cars drive across Swiss border controls without any check.</p> <p>Britain actually was a forerunner with its mini-Schengen with Ireland. Even though Ireland is a sovereign republic with policy that over the decades has been at times inimical to Britain, no British politician \u2013 even during the worst of the IRA terror attacks \u2013 suggested imposing border control or passport checks on Irish citizens coming into Britain.</p> <p>Recently, the Lib Dems in South Yorkshire distributed a xenophobic newsletter attacking a Labour councillor of Danish origin who has lived in Britain for 24 years. The Lib-Dems described her as \"non-British\" in a cheap BNP-style dog whistle to local voters. Yesterday in the Commons, <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/\">UKIP</a>'s sole parliamentary representative, Bob Spink, wanted to know how many \"non-British\" people there are in the workforce. Tories fell in behind the UKIP man and shouted at ministers about the level of this new category of \"non-Brit\" who work here.</p> <p>The answer is that we cannot know unless we want to start counting every Irish, American, Australian, Canadian and other foreigner all the time. The queues at our airports are surely long enough as it is without insisting on another long line for everyone who catches a Ryanair or Easyjet holiday flight to be registered.</p> <p>There are 300,000 \"non-Brit\" sudents at our universities providing an economic lifeline to stretched university finance as well as creating new cohorts of young men and women who, one hopes, will appreciate their stay in Britain and become economic and political friends of Britain when they go home.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.zpwb.org.uk/en\">Federation of Poles</a> produced a dossier of Daily Mail headlines this year which described Poles in lurid, hostile, xenophobic language. Migration Watch constantly attacks foreigners in Britain. Yet now the Poles are going home fast. The easiest way to cut immigration is to have a recession.</p> <p>Britain has 24,000 foreign-owned firms according to a parliamentary answer I recently received. I would like to see that figure go up and when I am abroad at economic conferences I promise foreign investors they will be welcome in South Yorkshire despite Lib Dem and BNP xenophobia.</p> <p>But if all the language from top Tories is about limiting the presence of foreigners in Britain and ministers echo that refrain, why on earth should anyone come to a country where the media-political discourse is so hostile?</p> <p>Britain's economic comparative advantage under Blair and Brown is that we are the most internationally open of EU nation states. We create new barriers and type-cast \"non-Brits\" as the unwelcome other at our peril.</p> <p>After the Russia's invasion and dismemberment of Georgia, David Cameron said he wanted to punish Russian businessmen visiting Britain with heavy new visa restrictions. Given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/21/conservatives-partyfunding\">today's news</a> about the Tories and the oligarchs, Mr Cameron may regret his comments. But as a strong critic of Russian geo-political bullying I welcome the presence of 150,000 Russians in Britain adding and spending wealth in our country. The dispute with Russia is with the neo-authoritarian Kremlin. The wider and deeper the Russian economy grows the better and while Mr Cameron today has questions to answer about George Osborne and Russian billionaires Britain should not seek to punish Russian economic actors.</p> <p>If I believed there were easy measures that would reduce asylum seeker backlogs, send back the economic migrants who abuse the asylum rules, or reduce tensions when my constituents hear languages they cannot understand, practices they do not share, or ways of life they cannot understand, I would embrace them.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the Daily Mail described Britain as an over-crowded island which should prevent German Jews from emigrating here. Then our population was 30 million. Today it is twice that but still only 10% of UK land surface has dwellings on it. And with a bigger population we have become richer and freer. </p> <p>The Tory idea of a population limit is not far off Canute telling the tide not to come in. We have raised the age at which people can marry. Our brothels and massage parlours pullulate with teenage girls trafficked into Britain to satisfy ever-increasing demand for paid-for sex. But we cannot marry a non-EU citizen until he or she is over 21. Again, as with English language lessons (as if the 800,000 Brits in Spain were expected to speak Spanish) I have no objections but these are surface scratching measures.</p> <p>Britain has to be open for business, for ideas, for people. The immigration debate as defined by the Tories, the Daily Mail, Migration Watch and the BNP is about shutting down Britain.</p>",
  "<p>CNN's John King was <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/20/mccain-camp-looking-for-way-to-win-without-colorado/\">reporting this fascinating news</a> last night:</p> <blockquote> <p>(CNN) \u2014 The McCain campaign is looking at an Electoral College strategy heading into the final two weeks that has virtually no room for error and depends heavily on a dramatic comeback in Pennsylvania, which hasn't backed a Republican for president in 20 years.</p> <p>While Iowa, New Mexico and Colorado are still officially listed as McCain target states, two top strategists and advisers tell CNN that the situation in those states looks increasingly bleak. Iowa and New Mexico always have been viewed as difficult races, but the similar assessment of Colorado reflects a dramatic shift for a campaign that had long counted on the state.</p> <p>\"Gone,\" was the word one top McCain insider used to describe those three states.</p> </blockquote> <p>I've been writing, as my attentive readers know, that Iowa and New Mexico are looking pretty blue-ish. But I haven't been saying that about Colorado. If one assumes it is blue as well, that changes the math/maths a lot. Consider.</p> <p>Again, start from the presumption that Obama will win all the states Kerry won in 2004, which is today a reasonable presumption. That's 252 EV's. Iowa (7) and New Mexico (5) take him to 264. Colorado (9) takes him to 273 and makes him president (270 wins it).</p> <p>So, if you're in the McCain camp and you think the three states in question are gonzo, what do you do? You <em>have </em>to look for a blue state to pick off. Given that it makes sense to aim at Pennsylvania. It has 21 EV's. McCain is behind there now by double-digit margins, but if he can somehow swipe it away, then Obama's path to 270 gets a lot more complicated.</p> <p>Now, the interesting part. The implication of focusing on Pennsylvania means that McCain is going to focus on arguments that he thinks will be especially suited for Pennsylvania, right? Since it's heavily working class and partly Appalachian and quite rural, this may mean more Ayers, more socialism -- and it may mean the reintroduction of Rev. Wright, which McCain said he wouldn't use. And a lot of it will probably be last-minute and/or under the radar.</p> <p>The Obama people need to persuade the Clintons to spend the last week of the campaign in the state to keep it nailed down. I have seen 12-point leads dissipate in two weeks.<br></p>",

In 2004, the media declared itself <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10492-2005Jan14.html\">astonished</a> to see voter turnout break 60% for the first time since 1968. This year, local politicians are projecting an 85% turnout in the Santa Fe area. </p> <p>Even if they're being overly optimistic (and they probably are), it's remarkable to think that this many Americans are actually dedicated enough to their candidate - or scared enough of the other guy - to haul themselves off to the polls. </p> <p>After witnessing the Democratic political rally that took place in Santa Fe, it's also hard not to think that most of candidates running for office are still probably unworthy of this kind of devotion from their constituents. The event was supposed to whip up enthusiasm and lead the crowd to the polls. It turned out that the voters needed no leading - they knew exactly what they were about - and nothing they found at this local rally was likely stir up much enthusiasm, anyway. </p> <p>The Democratic candidate for the senate is Tom Udall, son of Jack Kennedy's Interior Secretary Stewart Udall and nephew to the Arizona congressman, Morris Udall. The former state attorney general and congressman seems like a perfectly decent mainline Democrat. He is big on <a href=\"http://www.tomudall.com/economy\">alternative energy</a>, but he also supports places like <a href=\"http://www.democracyfornewmexico.com/democracy_for_new_mexico/2008/06/tom-udall-votes.html\">Los Alamos</a> and Sandia National Labs, which are leaders in nuclear weapons research. </p> <p>Udall, who's <a href=\"http://www.democracyfornewmexico.com/democracy_for_new_mexico/2008/10/new-rasmussen-p.html#more \">expected to win</a>, couldn't do worse than the retiring Republican, Pete Domenici, who was best friend to the nuclear industry and is largely responsible for its highly subsidised revival, and who was responsible for decades of handouts to mining companies. While racking up his abysmal environmental record, the powerful Domenici has carried water for Republican administrations since the days of Richard Nixon, and was recently implicated in the scandal surrounding the firing of New Mexico's US attorney, David Iglesias.</p> <p>Still, it seemed a shame that Tom Udall, like the rest of the local politicians at the rally, couldn't offer these determined voters much beyond the usual cliches, thin on details or concrete promises. The Democrats, Udall assured listeners, would bring \"real change,\" turn around our struggling economy, provide \"affordable\" health care, and bring our troops home from Iraq - but he didn't say much about how or when. When our cameras cornered Udall and he heard the word \"Guardian\", the candidate launched into an enthusiastic account of his student days at Cambridge. When Marc Maron pushed him to describe his solution to the financial crisis, Udall turned and fled. </p> <p>As each candidate or official mounted the rostrum, one young voter standing near our crew whispered in my ear, \"pussy\". They were \"all a bunch of pussies,\" he said, who \"when push comes to shove won't stand up\" for healthcare, be against the war, or against Wall Street. Most of the crowd seems to like the congressional candidates well enough, but what's clearly drawing most of them here is some combination of disgust with the Republicans and enthusiasm for Barack Obama. </p> <p>Nevertheless, 2008 promises to be a banner year for Democrats in New Mexico, representing what could be a real partisan power shift in the state's national-level elected officials. Along with Domenici's Senate seat, one or possibly even two House seats could flip from the Republicans to the Democrats. It's quite possible that these crowds of determined voters will end up turning the state's entire congressional delegation blue.</p>",

  "<p>Good news, if true, from the OECD that the gap between Britain's rich and poor has been closed by Labour's efforts to help people struggling at the bottom. But let's concentrate today on the gap between the rich and the very rich in the shape of high jinks this summer on Corfu. </p> <p>It's what the OECD report jauntily calls \"the Hello! magazine factor\" and members of the cast include Peter Mandelson, Lord Rothschild's heir, Nathaniel, George Osborne and Oleg Deripaska. Nat and George used to be chums, real ones, members of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford together and stuff. But not any more by the sound of it. What a hoot!</p> <p>Still puzzled? As you may not yet have heard (it's only just emerging on the radio news bulletins) there has been a terrific falling out as a result of the disclosure that Mandelson went for drinks and even stayed on the vulgar yacht owned by Deripaska - Russia's Mr Aluminium \u2013 when it was parked off the Greek island in August.</p> <p>The soon-to-be business secretary's holiday activity first surfaced last month when George Osborne, shadow chancellor, told chums (who told the Sunday Times) that Mandelson had been \"dripping poison\" about Gordon \"joined at the hip\" Brown when the pair lunched in a Corfu taverna.</p> <p>No surprise there; Mandelson does gossip, both malicious and kinder versions. So does Osborne. What came next was more serious: the suggestion that Mandelson's \"friendship\" with the colourful Russian plutocrat placed him in a potential conflict of interest. </p> <p>Why? Because Mandelson was then EU trade commissioner and the commission was then investigating Comrade Aluminium's colourful business practices, not least allegations of \"dumping'' products on EU markets ie selling below cost. The commission later ruled in his favour, but it now transpires that Mandelson has known Oleg since 2005.</p> <p>As the newspapers love to say when skating on thin legal ice \"there is no suggestion that anyone acted illegally\". What's more, I believe them. There is usually \u2013 not always, but usually \u2013 less to these \"scandals\" than meets the eye. In joining the other Tory papers in recycling this rubbish the Mail falls back on the \"question of judgment\" line. Mandelson denies all and falls back on his right to privacy.</p> <p>What happened overnight is that Rothschild has <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4982254.ece\">written an angry letter to the Times</a>, complaining about the \"acres of coverage\" the paper \u2013 and its Sunday sister \u2013 gave to the Mandelson angle and disclosing that Osborne also invited Andrew Feldman on board the gin palace for that drink.</p> <p>Andrew Who? Andrew Feldman, good mate and tennis chum of David Cameron at Brasenose College Oxford, textile manufacturer (not directly, he gets other people to make the stuff) and now three-days-a-week chief executive of the Tory party.</p> <p>Jolly exciting and all that. But so what? Well, Rothschild's letter twists the knife in, claiming that Feldman may have \"solicited a donation\" from Mr Aluminium, who is not in a position to get out his chequebook because he is a foreigner. It's not allowed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/21/conservatives-partyfunding\">The Tories deny it</a>.</p> <p>The BBC has just started reporting the story as I type and its correspondents \u2013 Nick Robinson and Robert Peston \u2013 have confirmed the basic facts and repeated them. </p> <p>At some disputed point there was a discussion about a donation (\u00a350,000?), possibly through a UK-owned firm, though the Conservative party denies that it was solicited or discussed on the gin palace. The distinction is important. So is the date.</p> <p>Some rough lawyerly exchanges seem to have marked the discussions with the Times and Rothschild's first draft \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4982254.ece\">published online</a> - was amended before publication in today's paper. But the BBC is reporting that Rothschild says he has a witness to what he heard, a witness who would be prepared to testify if anything came to court.</p> <p>That's not likely to happen. High profile civil court cases are mostly for criminals, the greedy, mugs and poor people who are misled by contingency fee lawyers advertising on Sky. </p> <p>The really rich rarely need to go down that road and usually manage to fend off attempts by the public authorities \u2013 EU regulators included \u2013 to bring them to account. A pity, but there it is.</p> <p>What does this all tell us? Mainly that Rothschild, 37, scion of Europe's greatest banking family for two centuries and a very rich financier in his own right \u2013 it helps to have a little capital to start off with - does not take bad behaviour lying down. </p> <p>Ex-Mandelson aide (later a Guardian executive) Benjamin Wegg-Prosser blogged the other day that Osborne might regret becoming a \"blabbermouth\". Indeed. The Rothschilds are very grand as well as very rich and not easily pushed around.</p> <p>Interestingly, Nat Rothschild, heir to the \u00a3750m fortune of Lord Jacob Rothschild OM, is not New Labour. Earlier this year it emerged that Lady R donated \u00a3190,000 to the Tories, all of which was passed on to run Osborne's office. The shadow chancellor was criticised for accepting money indirectly \u2013 where it was less than transparent - though the standards watchdog concluded he meant no harm.</p> <p>Even more interesting, not reported in the Times, is the role of Rupert Murdoch here. Was he on Corfu for this bling-fest? Of course, he was. Concentrate! Rupert hosted a dinner on Corfu to mark his daughter Elisabeth's 40th birthday. Mr Aluminium and Lord Pete were both present. Natch!</p> <p>But Murdoch is precisely the kind of rich schmoozer who does do political business over drinks and is in a cat-and-mouse relationship with political elites the world over. </p> <p>As I never tire of saying, he's a Republican in Washington (at least until November 4) and a crypto-communist in Beijing. Hey, it's all business, and if you have to whack the Dalai Lama's Gucci shoes in the process, so be it.</p> <p>So the Osborne-Rothschild spat falls within his personal orbit. If his papers get the OK to run with the story \u2013 both anti-Mandelson and now anti-Tory \u2013 then Rupert is still playing his each way bet, his cat-and-mouse game with British politicians. </p> <p>They're the mice, by the way. Does Cameron need this in a major economic crisis? Does Gordon Brown? No.</p>",

The stage lasts until the human develops a cough, when this happens part of the your colony of germs is coughed out onto the humans hand.<br> <br>(Stage 2) (Time trial)<br>This stage is more challenging as you have to make it to a surface or object before the human can wash his hands! You can either leap to a surface guided by the wind or when the human touches a surface move directly onto it.<br> <br>(Stage 3)<br>There will be optional surfaces each with there own benefits e.g. door handle will be small but will come into contact with many humans, the kitchen sink will be larger with more chances to grow but there will be a higher risk of being attacked by good bacteria i.e. soap! Once you make it onto a new surface or object its time to start evolving into a stronger and more dangerous germ colony! Relying on environmental conditions e.g. other liquids mixing with your germs, food crumbs, other germs that you can join up with and form a super germ colony and most importantly temperature. Having taken over the object/surface completely, grown in strength and numbers,You will have achieved Virus status! The game then develops, suddenly something falls from the sky into your germ world, a huge \u00a310 note! having used all the resources available your germs infest the \u00a310 note (possibly time trial) just seconds from it being picked up and put into the humans wallet.<br> <br>(Stage 5)<br>This is were the game switches to world infestation mode.<br>Since moving onto the \u00a310 note the super virus germ colony is now in your control as you try and spread the virus from the \u00a310 note into supermarkets and banks and global companies until there is a global epidemic in which the humans do not know how to cure!<br>You are now the King germ, you are the most evolved germ there is. You are no longer a microscopic liquid based life form, you are now a tiny being with arms and legs with a lot of aggression to be unleashed apon the human race! Now decided if you want to sell the cure to the humans or enslave them forever with illness!<br> <br>You Decide.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andrew Ireson</strong> for The Gaia Game</p> <blockquote> <p><br>In this game you start by terraforming an initially \"dead\" planet, creating an atmosphere that can sustain life. However, the planet goes through cycles of ice-ages, meteor strikes, deadly volcanic erruptions and tsunamis, meaning that all higher life forms suffer routine extinctions. The challenge is to evolve intelligent life which can develop the means to escape the planet before the next extinction. However, as more intelligent species develop, so their activities have an ever more dramatic impact on Gaia's natural cycles, which may be benefitial or determental. Its a race between evolution and Gaia's lifecycle. The species that escapes the planet successfully can then go on to colonise another planet, and the process repeats.</p> <p>You control a team of human scientists who arrive on the planet on a spaceship, and live in a small self-sustaining bio-dome. Your team and their descendants are thus immune from the earlier existinctions. You control the activities of the scientists, who must find ways of modifying the planets atmosphere, temperature, hydrology and ultimately biology.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Matthew Ruigrok</strong> for Pumpkin Harvester</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Summary - Have you got green fingered aspirations, but don't want to get muddy feet?

You start off as a tiny sapling on the forest floor and must race against competing trees / plants and other hazards to grow through various stages of growth and development.<br> <br>What you do: Playing like a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up, you have to guide your sapling's growth upwards through the big bad rainforest.<br> <br>Rival trees are constantly springing up and will chase after you in pursuit of the sunlight (at the top of the level), so keeping your speed up by staying ahead of rival vegetation is the core facet to the gameplay.<br> <br>Along the way, you'll encounter all sorts of wildlife that will try to land on your tree and slow your progress. Initially you'll encounter small insects, but as your tree gets bigger, birds, squirrels and even monkeys will clamber onto your tree, weighing you down and hindering your rate of ascent. You can fend off invading animals by firing seeds, nuts and fruit at them.<br> <br>\"Lives\" take the form of different branches for your tree \u2013 if one gets overwhelmed by rival trees, play switches to another branch until your tree is \"dead\". On completion of each level, you \"level up\" by growing an extra branch (extra life) or trade that for a strength or speed bonus to help you through the next level.<br> <br>Power ups come via raindrops which fall down and will give you key bonuses if you can catch them:<br>- \"Leaf me alone!\" - sprout a leaf to either side of your stem/branch to put an obstacle in the way of pursuing plants, slowing them down;<br>- \"Lord of the Rings\" - add another ring to your trunk: this increases your strength and reduces the negative effects of wildlife landing on you;<br>- \"Audrey II\" \u2013 evolve a carnivorous flower to eat the invading insects and animals. Complete with a funky song, natch.<br>- \"Miracle Gro!\" \u2013 a speed-enhancing drug. Beware: this could see you banned from the Gro-lympics for life.<br> <br>In true shoot 'em up fashion, the aim of the game is to get the highest tree (score) possible!<br> </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Geoff Burgess</strong> for his first person shooter</p> <blockquote> <p><br>A first-person shooter in which all the enemies evolve against you. Day and night cycles represent multi-generational evolutionary leaps, as surviving monsters cross-breed to mingle attributes.</p> <p>In the day cycle monsters jump, fly, swim and crawl over the landscape towards you: You blast them as best you can.</p> <p>In the night cycle the survivors interbreed, taking characteristics from each parent (and additional random mutations): the resultant generation attacking the next day. The new monsters may not be able to walk but will have huge teeth; they may fly right at you but be unable to inflict damage. The key factor is that their parents are the ones you allowed to live; the ones you couldn't kill.</p> <p>For example: If you aren't good at water sections and close-combat, the next generation will be sharp-clawed swimmers.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338817901\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>They were once bitter rivals in Florida for the Democratic party's presidential nomination. But Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton hugged, kissed and joined forces in Orlando last night to launch a concerted three-day push to win over undecided voters in the key swing state.</p> <p>The two made a rare joint appearance at a public rally attended by an estimated 30,000 wildly enthusiastic supporters to begin a frantic final two weeks of campaigning before the November 4 election.</p> <p>The politician Obama once accused of \"stirring it up\" in Florida, for attending a fundraiser there against an agreement between them not to, was suddenly his new best friend. </p> <p>Introduced to the stage as the \"Iron Lady\", Clinton delivered a forthright endorsement of her one-time opponent's credentials for the White House and urged the voters who swept her to an ultimately meaningless victory in the state's Democratic primary to campaign anew for Obama. \"It's a mad dash for the finish line and we cannot take a single vote for granted,\" she said. \"If you knocked on doors for me, knock on doors for Barack. If you made calls for me, make them for Barack.\"</p> <p>By way of reciprocity, the mutual appreciation continued as Obama took to the podium immediately afterwards to deliver a 30-minute speech tilted strongly towards Florida's legions of working-class voters. He hugged her warmly, thanked her for her support and for introducing him as \"America's next president\", and announced that: \"Hillary Clinton shattered barriers to inspire millions,\" he said. \"I'm proud to call her my friend.\"</p> <p>Hugely popular in Florida, Clinton's presence confirmed Obama's unleashing of his heavy weaponry in a late attempt to seize a state won by George Bush in each of the last two elections.</p> <p>For three days this week, Obama, his wife Michelle, Clinton and senior Democrat Bill Richardson, the New Mexico governor, were due to make at least 20 campaign appearances in the state from Pensacola in the north to Miami in the south.</p> <p>Earlier yesterday, Obama spoke in Tampa as Clinton campaigned in West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale. Tonight, Obama will address voters in Miami, home to a majority of Florida's half million or so Cuban-Americans, who are traditionally Republican-leaning.</p> <p>In Orlando last night, thousands of disappointed supporters remained locked outside as Obama and Clinton swept in for their party's biggest public rally of the campaign in Florida. </p> <p>The Amway Arena is the regular home of the Orlando Magic basketball team, but Obama was casting spells of his own as he worked a keen audience, many of whom had queued since daybreak for a spot near the front.</p> <p>\"I remember watching tapes of Martin Luther King speaking years ago, and Barack Obama is the only one I've heard since who I believe when he says what he says,\" said Marsha Lawson, a 65-year-old grandmother from Winter Park, near Orlando, who arrived at 6am with her two daughters. \"Obama will be good news for us. I was going to vote today, but it can wait until tomorrow. I had to be here.\"</p> <p>With two weeks of early voting already under way in Florida, and opinion polls pointing to a clear Obama lead, Clinton urged supporters not to be complacent. \"We cannot falter, we cannot stop, we cannot take a single vote for granted,\" she said. \"Let's begin our march to take our country back. Now is the time to close the deal on Barack Obama, and close the book on eight years of failed Republican leadership.\"</p> <p>Aside from the cheering hordes, a raft of good news greeted the Democratic candidate as he arrived. Figures released yesterday showed his party has 600,000 more registered voters in Florida than the Republicans, overturning a 370,000 deficit from four years ago. </p> <p>With an overall electorate of more than eight million, it is Florida's undecided voters that Obama is chasing rather than those he knows he has. But it was an encouraging day for the Democrats to hear Erin VanSickle, the Republican state party spokeswoman, admit that: \"Florida is a blue state when it comes to registration.\"</p> <p>Additionally, four of the latest five opinion polls give Obama anything from a two to five-point advantage over Republican rival John McCain in Florida, a lead he has held since only the beginning of this month.</p> <p>As the assembled thousands in the packed open-air arena shouted their approval, Obama delivered a stinging attack on McCain. \"Florida is crying out for change,\" he said. \"I can take two more weeks of John McCain's attacks, but America can't take four more years of failed economic policies.\"</p> <p>The so-called I-4 corridor, named for the east-west motorway through the central Florida heartland from Tampa to Daytona Beach, is rich in working-class votes and the Democrats are sure they can win most of them. Alongside Joe the Plumber live Joe the Theme Park Worker, and Joe the Rocket Engineer, and in the current economic climate many are worried about their jobs.</p> <p>More than 3,500 jobs will be lost at the Kennedy Space Centre at Florida's Cape Canaveral over the next two years as the space shuttle fleet is retired, and Obama hopes a planned extra $2 billion investment in Nasa will ease things for the space agency and its workers. </p> <p>That news was welcomed by a group who call themselves the Obamanauts, a group of workers in the space industry in central and east Florida who are hoping their candidate will bring forward America's plans to resumed manned spaceflight after 2010. \"Obama's plans will help retain the aerospace workforce in Florida and around the country,\" said Tim Bailey, a space education consultant from Titusville and leader of a group that has modified Obama's official campaign logo to give it an intergalactic flavour.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Obama said he was determined to address Florida's unemployment rate, at 6.6 per cent half a point higher than the national average and the worst figure in the state for 14 years. He said he also has his sights set on Florida's soaring rate of repossessions, second only to California in the US.</p> <p>Working class votes from Florida are the key to \"bringing sunshine to Washington,\" Obama told the crowd, while Clinton added that she had devised a new slogan for Florida: \"Jobs, baby, jobs,\" a chant that quickly gained in popularity.</p>"
