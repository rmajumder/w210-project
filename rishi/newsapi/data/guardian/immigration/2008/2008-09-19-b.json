  "<p>Meet Lauren and Heidi and Whitney. They're interchangeable blondes who whine their way through MTV's bogus reality show, The Hills. There's a brunette as well; her name is Audrina. Maybe if they had personalities we might be able to tell them apart; their boyfriends seem to have problems distinguishing between them as well, which sometimes leads to friction between the friends.</p> <p>Though I'm too busy trying to work out which is which to notice their clothes, these girls are frequently hailed as fashion icons. Lauren launched her own clothing line in March this year. Heidi launched hers in April. Lauren, or Whitney, works at Teen Vogue. Heidi (or is it Audrina?) is an event planner. Whitney, or possibly Lauren, works at People's Revolution, which has to be the most ironically hilarious name for an LA-based fashion PR firm ever.</p> <p>Could these vapid prom queens be any shallower and more annoying? The funny thing is, we're supposed to care about the daily nail-parings of these jumped-up cheerleaders, pom-pom girls, jock-chicks, Queen Bees, pampered princesses. Even if you've never been anywhere near LA, you know exactly who they are. They're the characters you always hated when they were in teen movies. And now they're everywhere \u2014 not just in teen flicks but in rom-coms and horror movies, on TV shows, popping out of magazines and newspapers, plastered all over the internet. We can't get away from them. The cheerleaders are running amok.</p> <p>Once upon a time, the prom queen was a despised figure of fun, or a malicious teenage despot whose mission in life was to torment geeky classmates who didn't fit the mould. In days gone by, she would invariably get her comeuppance: blown to smithereens (Carrie) or poisoned (Heathers) or stabbed (Halloween) or flattened by a truck (Mean Girls). Or, at the very least, she would be humiliated. But not any more. Now the cheerleader is indestructible \u2014 literally so in the TV show Heroes. The jock-chicks have trampled in their Jimmy Choos all over their more simpatico sisters to usurp the role of heroine and survivor. The Final Girl in today's slasher movies is no longer Jamie Lee Curtis, girl next door, one of us; in the remake of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre it's babelicious, belly-button-baring Jessica Biel. And yes, I know Paris Hilton gets a pole through the head in House Of Wax \u2014 but it's another braindead blondie, Elisha Cuthbert, who gets to emerge unscathed for the finale.</p> <p>Ironically, I think we can lay some of the blame for the prom-queen plague at the feet of smart shows like Buffy The Vampire Slayer, which didn't just turn the stereotype upside-down by making her an honorary geek and social outcast, but also introduced the then-novel idea that hot blondes who looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar weren't necessarily snotty bitches to be hissed at but heroines, worthy of our respect.</p> <p>The heroine of Gossip Girl, the horribly addictive TV show that comes across like Cruel Intentions Lite, is precisely the sort of rich, popular girl who would once have been the she-villain, but now we're supposed to care about her tribulations on the Upper East Side or in the Hamptons. Even rich bitch Ashley Tisdale in the High School Musical films is a softie whose comeuppances inconvenience her for about, ooh, five seconds before she's singing and dancing again. Seriously, where's Carrie when you need her?</p> <p>Maybe it's a side-effect of the Bill Gates syndrome \u2014 the geek inheriting the earth, and getting his choice of chick along with it. Young male nerds who, pre-internet, would have been social and romantic non-starters, now find themselves forming the dominant demographic, dictating movie content and taste for the rest of us. And naturally their preference is not for their geeky female counterparts, but for the sort of hot totty that, in real life, wouldn't give them the time of day. Look at the Judd Apatow school of young male-orientated comedy, in which creepy, charmless no-hopers like Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill get it on with cheerleader types. As if.</p> <p>But if the male nerds end up with the prom queens, who's left for the geeky girls to get off with? Don't worry, it's not a problem; there are no geeky girls any more. Snippy Ellen Page in Juno and chubby Nikki Blonsky in Hairspray are exceptions that prove the rule. It's as though there's been a cosmetic pogrom; the prom queen has so utterly ousted her homelier rivals that, nowadays, Hollywood's idea of a girl-nerd is Katherine Heigl in 27 Dresses, or Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada, or Jessica Alba in Good Luck Chuck. But just look at them: if these actresses are nerds, then I'm Angelina Jolie. And I can assure you I'm not.</p> <p>On those occasions when we do get ourselves a glimpse of genuine fem-geek, her physical \"flaws\" are exaggerated to such an absurd degree it's like fancy dress (see Ugly Betty). And there's an unspoken movie rule that geeky girls have to undergo a prom-queen makeover before the final credits. In upcoming movie The House Bunny, blonde bombshell Anna Faris (whom we'll give a free pass because, unlike some of the actresses I've mentioned, she is very talented) teaches a sorority house of female brainiacs how to dress like hookers so they can attract boys. Which is apparently preferable to being clever.</p> <p>The makeover is endemic in real life (or what passes for real life in places like LA) as well. There must be countless young actresses who, like Lindsay Lohan, have reinvented themselves as cheerleaders, replacing their quirks with long blonde hair extensions and plasticated body parts. At least Lohan has, or had, a modicum of talent; unlike, say, Jessica Simpson, an actress so dumb she can't even play a dumb blonde convincingly \u2014 though she is lucky enough to have a film-producer dad.</p> <p>But we can't just blame cheerleader-itis on the wish-fulfilment fantasies of young male nerds. Young women are increasingly colluding in their own Barbiefication \u2014 falling over themselves to have surgery to remake themselves in the image of idols who seem to resemble live-action incarnations of Disney's cartoon princesses. It's a modern epidemic that seems to have picked up speed after the remodelling of the Disney Channel in 2002 and the rise of mini-heroines like Lizzie Maguire, Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus, but it's not confined to Disney.</p> <p>Films, TV shows and magazines aimed at teenagers are constantly peddling the message of \"being yourself\" \u2014 so long as it's a self that cleaves to the three Fs of fashion, fame and fuckability. But just watch the frantic back-pedalling if the sexuality gets too explicit, as with Annie Leibovitz's photographs of Miley Cyrus for Vanity Fair.</p> <p>And the clone-like aspect is emphasised by the popularity of sister acts: Hilary and Haylie Duff or the freaky-looking Olsen Twins (whose hollow-eyed goth pose can't conceal their privileged princess personae).</p> <p>Otherwise, it's as though an entire generation of young womanhood has adopted Reese Witherspoon's dumb prom queen send-up in Legally Blonde as a role model. Witherspoon was also responsible for one of the more sinister cheerleader portraits of the 1990s; in the sociopolitical satire Election, she played the ultimate schoolgirl overachiever, the terrifying Tracy Flick, last glimpsed climbing into a limo with an important Republican. It's all too easy to imagine Tracy being captain of the school basketball team, head of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and runner-up in the Miss Alaska beauty pageant. For what is Sarah Palin if not a brown-haired Tracy Flick, 25 years on? Yes, the prom queens are taking over the asylum, and if America doesn't look sharp it really is going to find itself saddled with the cheerleader from hell.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The House Bunny is out Oct 10, The Hills, Oct 5, 8pm, MTV1</p>",
  "<p><strong>What's going for it?</strong> <br>Time was, England's most northerly city was considered the edge of civilisation. Now the only skirmishes tend to be on match day at United or occasionally in the bars of Botchergate. More of a town than a city, with a historic centre, with a castle, cathedral and links to that most fashionable of Roman emperors, Hadrian. Glorious, wild countryside in every direction. Low unemployment, low crime rate, the only decent collection of shops for miles. Carlisle is etched in the memory after the floods of 2005, but some good came of all this, with millions being spent on flood defences, new schools and colleges, and a much-needed bypass.

  "<p>Five minutes ago, Emily Mortimer was Anna Karenina in Prada lace; before that, she was Holly Golightly in Balenciaga silk. But, for the minute, she is Emily, in a denim miniskirt and black T-shirt, perched on a stool and eating salad from a plate on her lap. I am about to launch into my first questions, which interview etiquette demands must be about the subject's latest project, in order to get this, the premise for the encounter, out of the way before getting down to the serious business of nosiness. By way of preamble, while I am still fiddling with my tape recorder, we are chatting about interviews in general. </p> <p>\"The thing about interviews,\" Mortimer says, \"is you know perfectly well people don't really want to listen to you bore on about your job. Even though that's supposedly what they're interviewing you about. There's a cursory few questions at the start when they politely ask about the film, but you know they're not going to put hardly any of it in. The article will be all personal stuff. And with the British media you have to be slightly on your guard because you know that the dopiest, most embarrassing thing you say will be the first thing they print, top of the page, in bold. So you end up presenting a kind of counterfeit version of yourself to the world, with soundbites and jokes.\" She stops, looks up from her salad and smiles her winning smile. \"Anyway! Do start.\" </p> <p>Touch\u00e9. As opening moves with which to wrong-foot nosy journalists go, this takes some beating. But then Mortimer has never been your average ditsy starlet. Her father, to whom she is extremely close, is Sir John Mortimer QC; she was studying English and Russian at Oxford when the agent mother of a friend spotted her in a student production of The Trial, and went on to cast her in a TV production of Catherine Cookson's The Glass Virgin. In her 20s, as well as carving out a lucrative niche playing (in her words) \"posh Sloanes\" - culminating in Perfect Girl, whom Hugh Grant meets at a W11 dinner party, in 1999's Notting Hill, she wrote a very funny fictional fortnightly column, An Actress's Life, for the Telegraph.</p> <p>It is not difficult to see why Mortimer kept getting cast as the English rose. There is something rather old-fashioned about her: the alabaster skin, hair that looks distinctly un-blow-dried, and head-girlish speaking manner. Today's vogue among young female celebrities is to converse with the press in a stream of anodyne faux-intimacies and half-baked pop-psychological theorising, all looped together with \"likes\" and \"y'knows\". Mortimer, by contrast, will begin a sentence (\"I think that...\") and then pause, leaving a silence in which you can sense her editing her words in her head, before committing them concisely to the tape recorder in that distinctive half-rasping, half-squeaky voice. </p> <p>Just under a decade ago, at the moment when she seemed pigeonholed playing nice posh girls, Mortimer's life changed tack. She ditched her prim image by appearing nude in 2001's Lovely &amp; Amazing and moved to LA, where she announced her arrival in Hollywood with roles opposite Bruce Willis (The Kid) and Samuel L Jackson (The 51st State). In January 2003 she married an American actor, Alessandro Nivola; their son, Sam, was born nine months later. </p> <p>Mortimer lived in LA for six years. Moving to a city she once called \"a beauty parlour at the end of the universe\" was a neat trick to escape being for ever John Mortimer's daughter. It was, as she puts it, \"nice to be somewhere where you are not defined by your background, by the school you went to. I have a fear of being defined, of being one thing. That feels deadly.\" There are, she says, \"lots of good things about LA. Where we lived in Echo Park, you can sit in your garden and see a hummingbird and a coyote, and at the same time there's a helicopter circling overhead after someone who's done something dastardly. It's all rather exotic.\" </p> <p>Like many bluestocking-ish women, Mortimer has a semi-secret fascination with the sunnier, shinier side of life represented by California and its girls. (One of her teenage passions was to watch ice dancing on television.) Nonetheless, the positivity of America can grate on her English sensibilities. \"I did an interview recently where the journalist put thousands of exclamation marks after everything I said. Most of the quotes that were attributed to me were things I had more or less said, but with all these exclamation marks, so it was all 'Martin Scorsese's so sweet!!!!!' Oh God, please don't let Martin Scorsese read that. I sound idiotic.\" </p> <p>After two years in LA, she says, it dawned on her \"that this might be my life, that I might never get home, that I might be an expatriate. Somehow I just didn't see it coming, which is actually quite thick of me considering I married an American.\" After \"railing against it\" for a while, she has made peace with her new life and is working towards joint citizenship, which she is hoping will come through before November so she can vote for Obama. Two years ago, she relocated to Brooklyn (\"very nice, a lot like Queen's Park\") primarily in order to be a few hours closer in flight time to her family, and particularly her father, who at 85 is no longer in robust health. </p> <p>It is her father to whom Mortimer owes her cheerfully unmodish taste in literature. Her favourite book is Great Expectations (\"terrifying, brilliant, heartbreaking\"); her dad, she says, is \"a Dickens nut\" and the taste rubbed off on her. When in need of airport or beach reading, she prefers the nursery-pudding jollity of PG Wodehouse to chick lit. \"In fact, this is embarrassing, but I have hardly read a book written after 1950. I'm reading Doris Lessing's The Golden Notebook [1962] right now, and that's about as contemporary as I get.\" </p> <p>Her father's advocacy of prison reform - \"he always spoke very highly of murderers\" - has inspired her to volunteer at a women's prison in Brooklyn. \"I know it's not a sexy subject, prison reform. It's not starving children or polar bears, it's people who have fucked up. But to me it's a measure of civilisation, how we deal with prisoners - people who have no voice, who are not deemed worthy of respect. But I don't want to make it sound like I think I'm saving the universe or something. And I'm doing it partly for myself - it makes me feel more connected to America, doing something like this.\"</p> <p>This spring, Mortimer took a terrifying plunge into Manhattan life with a theatre role in Parlour Song, a play by Jez Butterworth. It was, she says, \"very, very scary - every single night\". She won rave reviews: the New York Times described her as \"a sly stunner\". She has not been slacking on the film work, either, and will soon have a slew of cinema releases. First comes Redbelt, which is \"a sports movie - like Rocky, but directed by David Mamet, and all about jujitsu\". Then there's Pink Panther 2, and Transsiberian, directed by Brad Anderson, which she says was great fun to film (\"when you're jumping between train carriages, you really feel like you're in a movie\"). And she has just finished Ashecliffe, a Scorsese film with Leonardo DiCaprio, which she loved \"because in a Scorsese movie everyone from the clapper loader to the costume designer is the absolute master of their art. It's a class act.\" Next up are roles opposite Andy Garcia and Steve Buscemi. </p> <p>But while on the Paris set of Pink Panther 2, Mortimer had a humbling experience. \"There were all these very famous people in this film, but they'd all gone home. It was raining, and there was one lonely photographer standing outside the trailer. I had my curlers in and he papped me and I was thinking, 'Well, obviously this is outrageous and invasive but, gosh, I guess I've arrived.' And then the make-up girl, who was holding an umbrella over me to protect my hair from the rain, pulled it lower to shield my face from him. And the photographer - who was English - shouted really sarcastically, 'Yeah, like she's so fucking famous.' I thought, 'You can't do that! You can't pap me and then abuse me for not being famous enough!'\" It's a classic Mortimer soundbite: self-deprecating, crisply told and with a keen sense of the absurd. And on that note she is whisked off to make-up to be transformed, fittingly, into a modern-day Jane Austen heroine, dressed in Alexander McQueen.</p>",
  "<p>Cannes may be the high watermark of the film festival year, but there are other places that, though they have a lower international profile, have higher returns in the way of local beauty spots, cheaper prices, and better food and service. Best of all, they offer a chance for the general public to see the films on offer. </p> <p>The Torino (Turin) festival which began in 1982 was recently taken over by Italian director Nanni Moretti (Caro Diario, The Son's Room), and has become less cutting-edge but more of an all-encompassing celebration of world cinema with an emphasis on emerging film-makers.</p> <p>This means the main selection might be a bit of a punt for the casual filmgoer; unlike festivals in San Sebastian (Spain) and Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic), Torino doesn't tend to platform the bigger hits from Cannes and Venice, so there's quite a big element of chance - you're as likely to end up with a quietly searing Japanese drama as a laugh-out-loud American indie. It's a buff's event, with a focus on directors, although two years ago that meant there was a chance to see Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette and Clint Eastwood's Flags Of Our Fathers. Unlike Cannes, there's little red carpet palaver and more audience engagement, so it's worth staying put for the Q&amp;As afterwards. In recent years these included John Landis, Claude Chabrol and Hollywood legend Ernest Borgnine. Something Torino does very well is retrospectives, and this year it will showcase two heavyweights: directors Roman Polanski and Jean-Pierre Melville (famous for his crime dramas with Alain Delon). But be warned, English subtitles are not always a given.</p> <p>This year there's also a UK retrospective called The British Renaissance, featuring such early 80s classics as the Terence Davies Trilogy, Stephen Frears's My Beautiful Laundrette and Bill Forsyth's Local Hero, plus a special TV tribute to Dennis Potter (The Singing Detective). It's likely that some of those directors will attend the screenings, another reason to cough up the \u20ac10 or so for a ticket (2008 prices have yet to be unveiled, but go on sale from November 10).</p> <p>Befitting a more casual festival, there aren't the flamboyant parties of Cannes and Berlin, but it's worth keeping an ear to the ground for receptions and cocktail parties that will be packed with industry people. Stars tend to be of the Italian variety, but they'll drive the crowds wild even if you don't recognise the likes of Maria Grazia Cucinotta (buxom star of Il Postino). The lavish opening and closing parties are held at the fabulous Cinema Museum, with amazing views of the mountains and city, but the venues for the festival itself are usually pragmatic (three fairly new multiplexes). Sightseers will find a glorious art deco movie palace called the Lux on Turin's main thoroughfare, which, sadly, has been closed for quite a few years now. </p> <p>The real plus of this festival, though, is the city itself: exceptional food and wine, world-class art museums, the fabulous Cinema Museum, which houses a collection of rare movie memorabilia, including 300,000 posters, and possibly the best shopping for men's clothing in Italy, which in itself is saying something. </p> <p>It's just a fantastic city to stroll around in, and if the fog comes in, the piazzas become as cinematic and atmospheric as anything you're likely to see on the big screen.</p> <p><strong>Festival</strong> <a href=\"http://www.torinofilmfest.org\">torinofilmfest.org</a>, Nov 21-29.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong> <a href=\"http://www.Ryanair.com\">Ryanair.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.flythomascook.com\">flythomas cook.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.easJet.com\">easJet.com</a> fly to Turin.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong> The Boston Art Hotel (0039 011 500359, <a href=\"http://www.hotelbostontorino.it\">hotelbostontorino.it</a>, doubles from \u20ac115) is decorated with works of contemporary Italian painters including an exhibition in the garden which hosts an aperitif party every Thursday. <br><strong>Damon Wise</strong></p> <h2>Reykjavik </h2> <p>The Icelandic film festival has been generating a buzz since it was founded in 2004, due to its bold slate of unconventional indie film from artists on the rise, fascinating talks and master classes by such film-makers as Atom Egoyan (Oct 4) and critics like Gerald Peary (Oct 2). Movie tickets cost \u00a36, talks up to \u00a315, though some are free. This year Paprika Steen, the Danish actress who has just finished directing her second film, will be making an appearance. The World Changes section of screenings and talks takes a look at environmental issues. </p> <p>After catching the latest wave at arthouse cinema Tjarnarbio, visitors can retire to one of the city's infamous bars on Laugavegur street, such as late-closing Sirkus. The international culture-vultures who attend also relish the chance to soak in the balcony hot tub at the Sundh\u00f6llin pools (where films are sometimes shown) on Bar\u00f3nsst\u00edg street, a great place to recover from the festival parties.</p> <p><strong>Festival </strong><a href=\"http://www.eng.riff.is\">eng.riff.is</a>, Sep 24-Oct 5.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong> <a href=\"http://www.icelandexpress.com\">icelandexpress.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.icelandair.com\">icelandair.com</a> fly to Reykjavik</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong> 101 Hotel (00 354 5800 101, <a href=\"http://www.101hotel.is\">101hotel.is</a>) Iceland's first boutique hotel-cum-gallery, has sleek rooms and a buzzy bar with doubles from \u00a3198 pn. </p> <h2>Warsaw</h2> <p>Poland's main film event is a trip through time and political realities, with screenings at the behemoth Palace of Science and Culture, a towering \"gift from the Soviets\", as festival director Stefan Laudyn describes it. Amid worn marble stairs and crystal chandeliers, film cognoscenti gather for a well-chosen collection of some 180 films (90% with English soundtrack or subtitles), and mostly the first or second features of film-makers from around the world, with tickets at \u00a33-\u00a36. </p> <p>The crowds enjoy the excuse to visit this increasingly fashionable city, which features stacks of clubbing and dining venues. One of the hippest, Sense (sensecafe.com), has a ground glass round bar and attracts gorgeous locals.

Its hosting of Glen Hansard and Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1 performing Falling Slowly well before they won an Oscar for the ballad (heard in the indie hit \"Once\") is typical of Moffom's forward thinking. Concerts, screenings and \"cine-concerts\"- musical accompaniment to films - fill out the turn-of-the-century Lucerna arcade on Wenceslas Square, one of the last remaining art nouveau gems in the district.

The town still features a classic bronze statue of a Soviet war hero within view of the film festival's main venue, the hulking communist-era Kulturn\u00ed Dum, the community hall every town once used for lectures on the dangers of capitalism. These days it's the scene of a cheerier prospect: grabbing a Pilsner Urquell and settling into your creaky wooden seat to catch the freshest new documentary films around, in the company of connoisseurs like Sean Farnel, programme director of Toronto's Hot Docs international festival. With its 2008 motto \"Thinking Through Film\", this small-scale event features hastily assembled tents for lawn parties (it can get rainy in autumn), and cobblestone streets with crumbing baroque facades to go with its screenings of films like Marcela, a three-decade chronicle of an average Czech woman's life and travails, and last year's winner, a probing look at north Bohemian border town life, A Town Called Hermitage. </p> <p>Filmmakers and audiences meet to chat and sample Jezek beer, fresh from the local brewery, where festival parties and buffets laden with smoked meats are held. </p> <p><strong>Festival</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dokument-festival.cz\">dokument-festival.cz</a>, Oct 24-29, tickets \u00a32.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong> Fly to Prague, as above.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong> Hotel Gustav Mahler (+567 320 501, <a href=\"http://www.hotelgmahler.cz\">hotelgmahler.cz</a>, doubles from \u00a330), a former Dominican monastery with thick, stucco walls just off the town's main square, is where the international film types gather. </p> <h2>Cottbus, Germany</h2> <p>Ranked one of \"50 unmissable film festivals\" by Variety, Cottbus has for years been a hotbed for movie scouts, who come to catch up on the best new work from the former eastern bloc. With eight film sections, including this year's Baltic film focus, tributes, shorts, and films for children and youth, the event transforms this otherwise sleepy hamlet into a microcosm of movie talent. The focus is more on inspiring film than inspiring venues (the staid Stadthalle Cottbus does the job) and Cottbus demonstrates what a former East German industrial town looks like in the 21st century. </p> <p>That said, it's a friendly town, with lots of traditional beer-halls and hundreds of films you're not likely to see anywhere else for \u00a33-\u00a36. If you can picture yourself in a vintage thriller like The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, you'll adapt very well to the tidy, slightly sinister aspect of this place (it's made much warmer by the packs of film geeks from all over Europe who gather here, of course). </p> <p><strong>Festival</strong> <a href=\"http://www.filmfestivalcottbus.de\">filmfestivalcottbus.de</a>, Nov 11-16.</p> <p><strong>Getting there </strong><a href=\"http://www.Ryanair.com\">Ryanair.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.airberlin.com\">airberlin.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">easyjet.com</a> fly to Berlin, one hour from Cottbus.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong> Waldhotel (0049 355 87 640, <a href=\"http://www.waldhotel-cottbus.de\">waldhotel-cottbus.de</a>, doubles from \u00a363) is rustic, woodsy and affordable, with a spa, wellness centre and discounts for festivalgoers, just a short walk from the venues. </p> <h2>Tallinn Black Nights</h2> <p>The Baltic's largest film event of the year is held in the region's most atmospheric port city. The best screenings are at the Kino Sappro, the city's top arthouse cinema, while the Animated Dreams mini-fest celebrates the proud local tradition of dissident cartoon making. </p> <p>The old town gets dark early, but that adds appeal to its cosy bars and traditional dining halls like Vanaema Juures on Rataskaevu street. Meanwhile, the new generation of Estonian and Russian media folk mingle at the Seduction discotheque on Viru V\u00e4ljak. It's a trendy city these days, and works hard at being fashionable - which makes the focus on independent film from around the region, priced for students, bohemian types and foreign film scouts, all the more appealing. </p> <p><strong>Festival</strong> <a href=\"http://www.poff.ee\">poff.ee</a>, Nov 13-Dec 7, tickets \u00a32.50-\u00a35.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong> Uniquestay Hotel Tallinn (0037 2660 0709, <a href=\"http://www.uniquestay.com\">uniquestay.com</a>, doubles from \u00a398 pn) has \"Zen\" rooms featuring Jacuzzis and earthy, designer features including sandstone colours and sauna. </p> <h2>Branchage International Film Festival, Jersey</h2> <p>Jersey's first foray into the celluloid festival circuit (named after the twice yearly official inspection to see if islanders are trimming their shrubbery) aims to break the mould with exotic screening locations, live soundtracks, art exhibitions and burlesque dancers. A mix of movies, from The Wicker Man, backed by live nu-folk music, to Suroosh Alvi's Heavy Metal in Baghdad and an acclaimed series of shorts, are being shown at eclectic venues around the island including second world war German tunnels, derelict magistrates' cells and Jersey's opera house. The Festival HQ, the box office for the \u00a36 screenings, is a striking 19th century spiegeltent - intricate hand-made canvas pavilion with mirrors, wood and leaded glass - which will also serve as a social hub, hosting lectures, parties and a major burlesque cabaret bash on Saturday night.</p> <p><strong>Festival</strong> <a href=\"http://www.branchagefestival.com\">branchagefestival.com</a>, Sept 25-28.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong> St Helier's stylish Club Hotel and Spa (01534 876500, <a href=\"http://www.theclubjersey.com\">theclubjersey.com</a>, doubles from \u00a3155 pn) is home to the Michelin-starred Bohemia.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong> <a href=\"http://www.Bmibaby.com\">Bmibaby.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ba.com\">ba.com</a>. <br><strong>Will Tizard</strong></p> <h2>How to bluff it as a film-fest buff</h2> <p><strong>What to wear</strong></p> <p>For men: skin-tight black polo necks and thick-rimmed glasses, accessorised with a copy of Cahiers du Cinema and a look of metaphysical angst. To pull this off, you have to be whippet thin and desperately good-looking, but it's de rigueur to try anyway. The majority just look doughy (all that sitting down), grumpy (all that arthouse) and crummy (all those biscuits). On the upside, a bit of body odour does wonders for safeguarding your personal space (all that queuing). </p> <p>Women must wear a skirt whose shortness is in direct proportion to the enormity of their sunglasses. Even at Sundance, where it snows. </p> <p>Whatever your gender you must be either very pale (for that screening room veteran look) or walnut tanned (particularly in Cannes, where the Eurotrash look gains you instant access to yachts). </p> <p><strong>What to carry</strong></p> <p>Anyone in an even faintly official capacity at a film festival will be issued a branded courier bag in which to lug around daily kit. But they're so desperately ugly the form is to junk them ASAP - even though they are, in fact, fantastically useful. So if you haven't been able to get your paws on one, they are available in every good wastepaper bin. And with a lick and a polish, might just impress your friends once you're back home.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong></p> <p>If someone else is paying, a swanky hotel (which is where all the real action goes on). But even the most rabid B&amp;Bs get booked very quickly so leave it too late and you may be left with the end of a sofa or, even, a park bench. Still, temporary homelessness can be turned to your advantage: call your tent an installation, shower in public, mumble something about climate change and - ta da! - you're the talk of the town. </p> <p><strong>Who to quote</strong></p> <p>The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, natch. Also any critic so obscure no one else will have heard of them (if in doubt, make a vaguely Ukrainian name up). Wandering around with a copy of that day's Variety speaks a thousand words. No need to actually wade through it. </p> <p><strong>What to eat</strong></p> <p>Nothing, if possible. Canapes if you must. Pastry when you feel faint.</p> <p><strong>What to drink</strong></p> <p>Ros\u00e9 may be sniffed at in the UK, but it's a staple of film festivals, even those outside France. Failing that, something they might glug in a western: a whiskey sour, or a quart of moonshine. Gimmicky cocktails are to be refused at all times: I once went to a Paris Hilton party in which they were serving nothing but eggnog in goblets shaped like enormous sperm.</p> <p><strong>Catherine Shoard, editor of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">theguardian.com/film</a> </strong></p>",
  "<p>What is this? The Day Of The Action-Bozos? Last week a new Vin Diesel epic exploded upon the world like a pustule rudely lanced, followed this week by Death Race, more of the same dreck from Jason Statham. What's next? A Van Damme/Dolph Lundgren/Steven Seagal revival? My heart can't stand it.</p> <p>Diesel and Statham are both marquee figures in two or more action-bozo franchises: The Transporter, Crank, In Defence Of The King and Whatever Guy Ritchie Does in the case of The Jayce; with xXx, The Chronicles Of Riddick and The Fast And The Furious (yeah, he's back for the sequel to the threequel) comprising three tentpoles of the Diesel empire. And each has at least two more franchise sequels currently in the pipeline. </p> <p>Now, while I have some patience for Statham (Crank is some kind of undiagnosably demented masterpiece, and The Bank Job is nice, though it doesn't exactly stretch him), I see Diesel as the ideal movie star for the post-intelligent world foreseen in Mike Judge's Idiocracy - the perfect face to go with that American-Moronic dystopia. In that world, all movies will be like xXx or Babylon AD or The War; every star will make a movie opposite Jet Li; every movie hero will be an ermined pimp-daddy, a porn star, a catwalk fashion icon, an undefeated Ultimate Street Fighter and a noted Destroyer Of Supervillains. And all of them will adhere to Diesel's Code Of The Bouncer, which he once articulated thusly: \"Shut your mouth, watch your back, and keep working 'til your ass falls off.\"</p> <p>We become stupider and more bestial the longer we're forced to watch them. Likewise, the separate action-bozo oeuvres of Ice Cube, DMX, Milla Jovovich and all the second-rankers and second-raters. They come with their own directors, guys who specialise in this kind of undifferentiated action-emptiness, like Paul WS Anderson - whose back catalogue is as calamitous as Alan Smithee's - and his Gallic doppelganger Mathieu Kassovitz (and I say this as a fan of La Haine who wonders what the hell happened). The result is a film landscape that calls to mind the arid, dispiriting wasteland that was the latter part of Charles Bronson's career - all cheap vengeance and bullshit frontier justice, the ceaseless adoration of brute strength and an allergy to any kind of intelligence or nuance.</p> <p>Taking a cue from the grandaddy of the action-bozo genre, I say we take these stars and directors, add their ageing forebears to function as a kind of officer class - the whole Van Damme-Seagal-Lundgren Axis Of Idiocy that feasted so long on Arnie's leavings - and intern them all on some prison island, like the sealed-off Manhattan in Escape From New York. Then we tool them up with chain guns and plasma cannons, set the cameras rolling, and let them have at it forever and a day, or down to the last action-bozo standing.</p> <p>Let them pretend they're remaking The Dirty Dozen or Aliens or Resident Evil 43 until the end of time, and they'll never even notice the rest of us have disappeared.</p>",
  "<p>Every Coke has a Pepsi, every Visa a MasterCard. Who do you support in the Boat Race and why? Don't you dare tell me you couldn't give a fig either way: it's Oxford or Cambridge, at some point one must develop a preference, for whatever reason. It's Harvard or Yale, Harpic or Domestos, AA or RAC, PC or Mac. Binary tribalism: Gilbert and Sullivan wrote a song about it.</p> <p>In the world of serious SLR photography, the choice has always been between Nikon or Canon. The single lens reflex (SLR) camera is best defined as being the sort of camera where what you see is what you shoot. As the initials tell you, it is a single lensed entity, a lens that can be changed with a twist of its bayonet. A clever mirror ensures the viewfinder's image is more or less congruent to that of the lens. The SLR is the choice of photojournalists, paparazzi, sports photographers - anyone who needs fast, accurate shooting. The camera goes up to the eye and will be manufactured (with apologies to Pentax, Olympus, Leica and Minolta) by Nikon or Canon. A huge range of Nikkor F-mount lenses for the Nikon and EOS EF lenses for the Canon have built up over the years; they are forwardly and backwardly compatible with new DSLR and old SLR bodies, but not across the brands. An EOS won't fit a Nikon body nor a Nikkor a Canon. There are issues with older Canons and with some Nikon auto focus lenses, but generally speaking, this broad description is correct. A profitable war zone where two major powers continue to joust.</p> <p>One of the most active battlefields within this world is that of the entry level DSLR. Many people with ordinary compact digitals decide, after a while, that they are ready for the Real Thing. Serious professional kit is wildly expensive, but there is the mid-priced range for the prosumer (yes, isn't that a lovely word?), and finally there is the \"My First SLR\" category, hotly contested because once a toe is dipped into either the Nikkor or EOS pool, it is unlikely the customer will change: too much will have been invested in the lenses.</p> <p>Canon has had its reliable 400D and 450D and Nikon their excellent D40 and D60 models available as entry level DSLRs for some time, but I have been spending the past week in the company of Canon's new 1000D (aka the Rebel XS or Kiss F), which I will come straight out and say I adore. It does everything you could hope to welcome a newcomer to the field of SLR photography.</p> <p>New DSLRs are exceptionally annoying: the outlay is far from insignificant and it is galling when, six months after you've taken the plunge, a new one comes along. I won't claim that Canon will never improve on the 1000D, but I can recommend the plunge being taken here and now. For about \u00a3400 you get one hell of a lovely camera. It is astoundingly light (some people will dislike that; I happen to love it), manageable and friendly. With four-stop image stabilisation, a 10.2 MP sensor, a customisable menu, an integrated anti-dust self-cleaning system, a large enough LCD display (albeit slightly smaller than other models), excellent Pro software, the Digic III processor used in higher-end models, SD and SDHC (but not Compact Flash) memory card compatibility and just about all the features you would expect on a prosumer model (no spot metering though, which some users will miss), it is superb value for money. It reacts quickly in Jpeg mode and, most importantly, takes fantastically high quality, low noise photographs using a gigantic permutation of manual and automatic settings. A true pro would wish for faster responses when shooting RAW, but for the rest of us, this is The One. All the convenience and ease of a compact is there, but underneath lies the potential of a real grown-up SLR. If you do buy one, give yourself time slowly to learn about real photography. Be warned: as in music and painting, no gadget can replace talent. For what it's worth, I have Mr Magoo's eye for a shot.</p> <h2>Initials of the week</h2> <p><strong>DSLR</strong> Digital single lens reflex.</p> <p><strong>SDHC</strong> Secure digital high capacity memory cards. </p> <p><strong>RAW </strong>An uncompressed, unprocessed image file.

  "<p>It was the plastic teapot sweetly proffered by my two-year-old daughter, Mery, that finally made me decide to take a break from the booze. \"Glass of wine, Mummy?\" she asked, head cocked to one side, all big blue innocent eyes. At the time I was slumped on the sofa, reading three-day-old Sunday papers and trying hard to suppress the rising self-loathing erupting from the pit of my queasy stomach. Once again I had quaffed much too much wine: about six very large glasses of house white, with the girls - or rather thirtysomething fellow mums - during a five hour session at the village local, an evening that culminated in me being thrown out for telling the French chef that he couldn't cook. </p> <p>I don't remember much after that. I've no idea how, or at what time, I staggered home, although my husband smugly reports he heard a \"terrible crashing about at 1am\".</p> <p>I have long suspected that I am becoming a cliche: Cotswold resident, thirtysomething, ex-career lady now slack housewife, mother of three, commuter husband, seeks solace avec chardonnay bottle. Rather horrifyingly, my profile echoes the secret wino as portrayed in the government's latest anti-binge drinking TV adverts: the rioja-guzzling mummy who doesn't notice the units clocking up, believing her habit is normal and innocent.</p> <p>There were other telltale signs of a casual habit spiralling out of control. My diary started to take shape around predicted hangovers - I knew if I was going out somewhere that the following morning would be a write-off. I'd also started to have two bottles of wine open at the same time so my husband would be confused by my alcohol consumption. Even I must acknowledge that such subterfuge hints at addiction. Or at least that I was a binge boozer. According to the International Centre for Alcohol Policies,...#65279; binge drinking is the practice of consuming more than four drinks in one sitting. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong: I can spend a booze-free night. What I can't do is have just one drink. The first is so very nice I'll always want another. And now those two have made me feel all warm and politely woozy, it would be a shame to bypass a lovely third or, indeed, a fourth. Half a bottle or 4.5 units later, a binge drinker is born. This happens, if I'm honest, about five nights a week. Although if I'm in a more social setting, I will go for an all-out \"bonkers binge\".</p> <p>Finally the shame, self-doubt, doomed liver, despairing husband, empty purse and guilt over the corruption of my own children's playtime rituals led me to surrender to a period of abstinence from alcohol. I had to climb on that wagon. This is how it went.</p> <p><strong>Week one</strong></p> <p>I approach day one of Giving Up Booze with trepidation. Do I really have a problem? Maybe cutting down is an option ... Am I just normal and paranoid? Should I get my liver weighed or scanned or whatever it is one does for motivation? How fat is my liver - as overweight as I am (I have a surplus stone)? Will giving up change my essential me-ness? Oh my God, I might become boring! Etcetera. </p> <p>Actually, Monday's fine. I often don't drink on a Monday so I manage that. Tuesday is like another Monday, so that's cool. Smugness sees me through Wednesday. Thursday finds me on some mad high of abstemiousness; this is the longest I've been without alcohol since my last pregnancy (two years): now that's a sobering thought. Friday is a bit of a black spot because I feel that frisson of excitement one gets at the start of the weekend but without the traditional toast of an extra large \"mummy's juice\". I battle on with a chilled glass of mineral water, fantasising about how fit and slim I will be by morning.</p> <p>I wake up no more obviously goddess-like than when I went to bed, but I do feel supersonically invigorated after my regular three-mile Saturday morning jog. Usually I procrastinate and it often feels like a slog, depending on what I've drunk the night before.</p> <p>We take the kids to the Horrible Histories theatre at lunchtime, which is a welcome distraction, except for the interval when I have a bit of a teary moment recollecting the V&amp;T I would usually be enjoying, with its playful tinkle of ice on glass and maybe even a slice and swizzle stick. So demented is my ensuing frustration that I go ballistic booing an Awful Egyptian in the second half. My seven-year-old, Molly, not known for rectitude, gives me a worried and slightly embarrassed look. </p> <p>By Sunday I notice that Steve, my husband, also hasn't had a drink this week. Yes, he confirms, he is also knocking booze on the head \"for a while\". Typically, he does things quietly, while I threaten loudly, advertising to the world my intention to write a novel/diet/do impressive stuff, obviously setting myself up for failure. But not this time. </p> <p><strong>Week two</strong></p> <p>I feel incredibly virtuous, but am suffering terrible tension-derived jaw ache, my teeth stubbornly refusing to unclench without the reward of a Cinzano moment. And my dreams have become strange fitful affairs: last night I had a vivid dream in which I was sipping a glass of chilled chardonnay. Even in my sleep I could sense the icy sugariness hitting my brain and untapping my blocked-up hypothalamus, the bit of the brain that houses the endorphins, poor little fellas trapped in there like that. I'm cringeing as I confess this, but I had to get up and remove the two bottles of wine left over from Christmas chilling in the fridge and shove them in the utility room by the tumble dryer so they'd warm up and stop haunting me. I can't abide warm white wine. </p> <p>Experiencing bouts of manic fidgetiness, I decide to redirect my energies into bringing order and cleanliness into the dysfunctional explosion of clutter we call home. I also take up drinking coffee. It has a kick, so is perfect for us semi-addicted types who find functioning under our own steam a bit of a chore, but if I'm at all hungover the thought of coffee makes me nauseous in the extreme. Anyway, as I'm not drinking, coffee has become my new thing. Although obviously not just coffee: mine's a latte with an extra shot please, barista. Caffeine and tidying, it's my Stepford Wife phase and I'm rocking it. The children skip around the house, marvelling at its tidiness. Syd, my boy, aged four, has a friend round and proudly points out the fine detailing on his hitherto obscured-by-toys Argos carpet. It has a lovely cityscape on it.</p> <p><strong>Week three</strong></p> <p>A feeling of decrepitude has snuck over me this week. For starters, I look absolutely ruddy awful. I'm sleeping loads, in a near coma, a deep, deep dribbly sleep. When I wake I'm as puffy as Mrs Puff (of SpongeBob SquarePants fame), with huge grey saddlebags resting under my bulbous eyes. First thing Tuesday morning I catch myself in the mirror and I look especially bad, as if I've aged a decade overnight, and I have sprouted three huge, evil, yellow-headed spots, which have made themselves comfy among the chin bristles. Clearly the booze had been having some kind of pickling effect on my system and I'm going into a Dorian Gray-style meltdown. Maybe it's the toxins escaping, but do they have to leave via my face?</p> <p>As if the whole ugly thing wasn't bad enough, I have spectacularly failed to lose much weight - a ton of deprivation and a few measly pounds lost. Which, of course, was good news in one way: it meant that, contrary to my fears, it wasn't wine that was making me cuddly, although the carb-craving hangovers can't have helped.</p> <p>Anyway the whole ugly/fat thing got to me. Normally I'd have a drink and forget about it, but since that's not an option I sink into a bit of a funk instead. Defiantly I make Nigella's pork in cider for tea, which, of course, involves buying a 50p can of Strongbow from the bargain bin of the supermarket. I knew as I bought it that an hour later I would glug some from the can. And indeed I do. It tastes absolutely rank and all I feel is deep shame that I am reduced to furtively guzzling warm cider in the kitchen while I'm supposed to be making supper. Steve asks what we're up to at the weekend. \"Not drinking,\" I reply sullenly. He looks surprised. Obviously life's the same happy event for him, with or without booze. Usually I look forward to the weekend: the Friday night drink, the gastropub visits, the celebratory the-kids-are-asleep pop of the Saturday night bottle ... all gone. I feel a bit lost.</p> <p>We take the kids to Country World for the day on Saturday. It's pelting with rain, but we race around playing crazy golf, panning for gold, feeding goats and marvelling at the residents of Guinea Pig Village (\"the largest in Europe\"). The great thing about kids is that even the naffest places become a hoot, and our brilliant family day gives me a boot up my self-pitying jacksie and puts a bit of perspective on the whole business of giving up. My beloved children are all the motivation I need. </p> <p>However, that doesn't mean I'm not gagging for a drink after our day trip. Stopping at Pizza Express on the way back I have a wobbly moment when the waiter offers us the wine list. I make do with a cappuccino, which I bolt down, and immediately order another. Even the waiter gives me a worried look when I order a third.</p> <p><strong>Week four</strong></p> <p>There is nothing quite as effective as the tedium of domestic servitude for driving a poor woman to drink. Housework is largely pointless: it's like the mythical, endlessly replenishing wine glass; as you drain the mess from one room, somewhere down the hall another bubbles over with discarded clothes, mouldy crockery, waste paper, sticks and general kids' squalor. There's no point in tidying, it'll only get messy again. I was fooling myself and can never hope to keep on top of the demented mess that is our home. I feel so much better now that I've succumbed to its squalor. My husband says he misses my manic efficiency.</p> <p>Then two days short of a month of abstinence, I go to an innocent-sounding PTA meeting. But there is wine. </p> <p>I get totally blotto, end up in the village pub, and can't remember getting home. The next day I feel shaky. I get in the car to drive the toddler to nursery and am sick into my own lap and on to the steering wheel. I sit there, not quite sure what to do with my lap-puddle of puke. I realise I can't drive and that I am a wretched individual. My sunny toddler sits strapped in her seat waiting for the car to start. I have reached a nadir. </p> <p>Alcoholics can never drink again once they have stopped because they can't be trusted. A friend of mine hasn't had a drink in 15 years, but he had got so bad that he had to spend two weeks in hospital after snorting dry cleaning fluid. At least my depravity hasn't sunk quite so low. I didn't want to quit drinking altogether, but I was beginning to wonder, for the sake of the kids, if I could ever be a mere casual tippler.</p> <p>I resolve to give myself another chance. These are my new rules: </p> <p>1) No drinking at home except on very special occasions, and never more than four glasses; 2) When out, remember not to drink so much that I behave too foolishly or can't remember what happened the next day.</p> <p><strong>Week five</strong></p> <p>Uh-oh. I am invited to the NME Awards, infamous for scenes of rock'n'roll excess. This is the test. I've attended many times - in a former, more carefree, life I was a journalist on the NME, and I've always got bladdered there. I've done things in toilets that have forced me to go into hiding for a whole week at a time. When I was invited this year I hesitated - could I be trusted? There would be copious amounts of free booze, celebs to accost, dancefloors to make a giant prawn of myself on. I realised that this was it. If I can't obey my own new rules, then it will be a life of sobriety for me, from here to eternity.</p> <p>On arrival I am presented with a Monkey Shoulder, whisky mixed with ginger beer and lime. It is delicious, and I happily slurp down a second. But that's it, until right at the end of the ceremony when, new drinking sophisticate that I am, I opt for a mandarin vodka and tonic. I feel warm and chirpy, sociable but not scarily over-friendly. </p> <p>Some time after dawn the next morning, I poke open a slightly bleary but perfectly functioning eye and spot a wilted daffodil strewn across the pillow. It takes a faltering second to remember where it came from: ah yes, Frank Carter from indie-punk outfit the Gallows presented it to me after his turn at the awards. I remember everything, I have no cringey recollections, just a fuzzy feeling of bonhomie. </p> <p>Also on the pillow rests my baby girl's darling head, abloom with tousled golden curls. I breathe in her sugary mustiness and don't feel sick at all. I am totally hangover-free. </p> <p>Job done ... for now.</p>",
  "<p>Since the UK immigration box-tickers stopped Lee Konitz, the eminence grise of understated alto-sax improv, from fulfilling his London gigs this month, maybe it reinforces the British scene's appreciation of its good fortune in possessing Martin Speake - an altoist with Konitz's quirkiness of melodic line, fondness for understatement, and enthusiasm for putting himself in constantly changing contexts. Speake came up in the prize-winning Itchy Fingers in the late 1980s, and his allegiances seemed to be the methods of the 1950s Cool School, and a little of Art Pepper. More recently, he has explored extremes of jazz. These gigs promote Speake's latest record, Generations, an absorbing visit to the standards.

  "<p>They are billed as Spain's new celebrity chefs but while Sister Liliana and Sister Beatriz appear weekly on television sets in Spanish living rooms they are not allowed to leave the convent where they live as cloistered nuns.</p> <p>The two nuns are the stars of a hybrid reality and cookery show called Taste of Heaven in which they teach viewers the secrets of the handmade cakes, pastries and desserts for which the country's convents are famous, and which many sell. They are also shown going about their other tasks and pastimes at the convent of the Concepcionistas Franciscanas in Segovia, central Spain, including singing, praying and basketball.</p> <p>\"It was a good opportunity to show to people what a contemplative life is, and to share our recipes,\" they said.</p> <p>Plum cake, rice mousse, custards, apple sauce, ice-cream and almond cakes are all on a list of recipes in which divine inspiration is given as an added ingredient.</p> <p>The nuns, aged 24 and 69, will share their recipes with viewers over the coming three months. Unlike other television chefs, however, they will not enjoy the slick studio sets often seen as an essential part of the genre. They film their show in the convent's spartan kitchens, using the simple - and sometimes ageing - instruments, gas rings and ovens at hand.</p> <p>Liliana, the younger of the two, does most of the presenting, though Beatriz is given to occasionally barking out orders. \"She is a bit temperamental,\" Liliana said. \"I am more peaceful.\"</p> <p>The nuns appear on Canal Cocina, a cable channel that includes Jamie Oliver among its international assortment of chefs. Beatriz has been behind the convent walls since 1948, when she began learning recipes handed down over hundreds of years. Liliana is a Colombian who entered the convent at 16.</p>",
  "<p>Dry ice billows forth. Doomy notes reverberate. From the shadows, some pale young men slowly emerge, wearing black clothes. This is very much the scenario you imagine with White Lies, a London group who announce themselves with a single called - try this, Kaiser Chiefs - Death. Gothic the group already are. Having built some impressive soundscapes, songs like Unfinished Business apply them to Interpol-like domestic tales. In theory, it's grand and emotional rock. In practice, they remind you of another gothic story. With the sound of Editors, and the pop sense of the Killers, White Lies are very nearly a young indie Frankenstein.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Club Ifor Bach, Cardiff, Sun 21; Night And Day, Manchester, Mon 22; Rough Trade East, E1, Tue 23; Little Civic, Wolverhampton, Wed 24; Bodega, Nottingham, Thu 25; Leadmill, Sheffield, Fri 26</p>",
  "<h2>Can I cover myself against airlines going bust and Eurotunnel fires</h2> <p>Contrary to most buyers' beliefs, the overwhelming majority of travel insurance policies do not cover scheduled airlines going to the wall. The Post Office, Swiftcover and the little known Karma insurance are the only insurers picking up the pieces in Zoom-styles bankruptcies.</p> <p>However, you can buy a \u00a34 policy to add to your current one that will pay \u00a35,000 if your travel firm goes bust. InsureFor, the internet insurer, offers a standalone policy covering supplier failure. It promises to provide an alternative holiday or a replacement journey in the event of major travel disruption or a business failure. </p> <p>InsureFor's annual worldwide cover costs \u00a38 per person. Single trip cover is just \u00a34 per person. You can claim up to \u00a35,000 less a \u00a350 excess if supplier can't provide the holiday services you paid for. </p> <p>The policies should particularly appeal to independent travellers who book their own cheap flights and hotel rooms direct, as well as regular users of low-cost airlines. If you already have a standard travel policy, there's nothing to stop you buying this cover on top. Go to InsureFor's subsidiary website, <a href=\"http://www.supplierfailurecover.com\">supplierfailurecover.com</a>. </p> <p>We got quotes for a family of four for worldwide annual multi-trip insurance from <a href=\"http://www.karmainsurance.com\">karmainsurance.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.postoffice.co.uk\">postoffice.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.swiftcover.com\">swiftcover.com</a> that include airline failure. The prices ranged from \u00a372 to \u00a3126.</p> <h2>Which airline is most at risk of going bust?</h2> <p>According to the betting firm Paddy Power, which enterprisingly has opened a book on just this issue, Alitalia is the clear favourite (odds of 5-4) followed by SpanAir at 3-1. Other firms on the receiving end of bets are Skyeurope and FlyGlobespan - both 5-1. AirBerlin is currently 7-1 and Wizz Air is 14-1. Just because an airline is on this list, it does not mean it is in trouble - check out <a href=\"http://www.Paddypower.com\">Paddypower.com</a>. If you are booked with an at-risk airline, make sure you are covered - particularly if you booked using a debit card.</p> <h2>And which is least likely to?</h2> <p>Interestingly, the giant no-frills airlines, Ryanair and Easyjet, are not considered at any risk of failing - you only get odds of 100-1 (the same as British Airways) that they'll fold. And the airline which the bookmakers think is the least likely to go bankrupt? Vatican Airlines, at 500-1. But Paddy Power will also offer you 1000-1 odds that Air Force One, the US President's plane, will be permanently grounded. </p> <h2>For what are you covered?</h2> <p>Anyone buying a holiday (flight and accommodation) from a tour operator or travel agent is automatically covered in the event the firm goes bust under the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (Atol) - the financial protection scheme for UK tour operators.</p> <p>If you are in the middle of your package holiday when the company goes down, the Atol scheme, overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority, will pay for you to be repatriated - and any hotel bills you were entitled to under your original booking. If your holiday is yet to happen, Atol will refund all the money you have paid, although you may have to wait a few weeks/months.</p> <h2>What about travel agents on the web?</h2> <p>Anyone buying a flight and hotel package bought from a website would be covered by the Atol rules. However, all flights purchased directly from an airline's website or from a travel agent which is booking the flight directly on your behalf are NOT. It is imperative to pay by credit card - or if you must, a Visa debit card - or have suitable insurance (see below).</p> <h2>What about credit card cover?</h2> <p>Assuming the flight cost more than \u00a3100, the credit card company is jointly liable to provide the service. If the airline fails, you will be able to reclaim a full refund of the flight from the card provider. If you're abroad when the airline fails, your credit company should pay half the total fare you originally paid, and is responsible for the cost of getting you home. Even if the cheapest fare you can find to get home is \u00a3500 - the credit card company has to pick up the bill \"to put you back in the same position that you would have been had the airline not failed\".</p> <h2>Do I need insurance if I only buy package holidays?</h2> <p>No - you can rely on the Atol scheme.</p> <h2>Debit cards - any cover?</h2> <p>Visa debit card users may be partially covered. The issuing banks have been processing \"chargebacks\" but you only get the money you lost - and you have to get yourself home. Anyone booking flights only using a Maestro or Connect debit card will lose their money - and will have to pay to get home.</p> <h2>What about discount flights bought from agents?</h2> <p>To further complicate matters, the Atol scheme will cover some (discounted) flights bought from travel agents - where the ticket was previously registered, and is effectively being sold on. Agents booking flights from airlines on your behalf don't offer cover. When buying a discounted flight from an agent, ask if the ticket sale is covered by Atol rules. You should be given an invoice with an Atol number on it.</p> <h2>Are holidays going to become more expensive? </h2> <p>Probably. Remaining operators will be able to start pushing up prices. </p> <h2>Should I buy holiday money now?</h2> <p>Not unless you spend colossal amounts. The hot money is on sterling weakening against the dollar a little further, but holding its ground against the euro. Analysts reckon that the crunch will hit continental Europe with full force later this year, sending the euro spinning.</p>",
  "<h2>Should I be using my debit card or am I better off with a credit card? Can I cover myself against airlines going bust and Eurotunnel fires?</h2> <p>With businesses going down quicker than a Trident submarine, there's never been a more sensible time to use a credit, rather than a debit, card when buying items costing more than \u00a3100. </p> <p>Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 means your credit card company is jointly liable, along with the retailer or trader, if something goes wrong with goods or services you paid for costing between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000. In short, if the firm goes under, the credit card company has to pay you back. The protection applies to credit card purchases made from companies or websites situated overseas, but cash withdrawals are not covered. Nor are credit card cheques. </p> <p>You can even claim if you put less than \u00a3100 on your credit card, as long as the goods or services you paid for actually cost more. Check out the case of David Marsh. </p> <p>Barclaycard reimbursed him the \u00a315,326 he thought he had lost after a web-based car dealer went bust prior to delivering his Toyota Prius.</p> <p>He agreed to pay Newcardiscount.com \u00a316,326 for the Prius, putting down a \u00a31,000 deposit on Barclaycard. He paid the balance by electronic transfer from his bank account. </p> <p>But the car was never delivered, and it emerged Newcardiscount had gone into administration. \"I thought we had lost our money but the administrator suggested we apply to Barclaycard - despite the fact that we had only paid the deposit by card. \"</p> <p>Marsh says the refund process was rather torturous - there were a huge number of forms. After a long wait, Barclaycard this week reimbursed all the money. </p> <p>\"I'm still not entirely clear how it works, but I'm mighty glad it does. I'll definitely be paying for everything with my credit card in future,\" he says.</p> <h2>I only have a debit card. Am I still covered? </h2> <p>Although debit cards are not covered by Section 75, you do have some protection. All Visa debit and credit cards are covered by its chargeback rules, so you can claim your money back for the same reasons as Section 75, for example, if goods aren't delivered or aren't as they were described. </p> <p>Visa Europe said: \"Visa chargeback regulations allow banks to recover money paid on all Visa debit, credit and prepaid cards from the retailer's bank, if goods or services are not delivered or are not as specified.\"</p> <p>Visa chargeback claims must be made within 120 days of the purchase or from the date the goods or services were due to be delivered. </p> <h2>So which credit card should I use when I head off to Bluewater?</h2> <p>The hot credit card at the moment is the American Express Platinum Moneyback card, which pays new cardholders 5% cashback, on up to \u00a34,000 spending during the first three months. Once this intro offer expires, its rates are tiered, paying a maximum 1.5% cashback. For spending up to \u00a320,000 the next best is the Egg Money card (not the standard Egg card). It pays 1% cashback on everything you buy, though the pay-out is capped at \u00a3200 a year. If you buy a lot of petrol, the Citi-Shell credit card is offering a 6p per litre discount using its cards in Shell garages for 60 days and then 3p per litre after that. You get 1% cashback on all other purchases.</p> <h2>If I use a credit card won't I get hit by nasty interest charges?</h2> <p>Not if you're smart. Lots of people now use their credit cards to buy everything, paying it off at the end of each month with a standing order that automatically debits their bank account. Assuming you've got the money, you'll incur no interest charges.</p> <h2>Is there any time when I shouldn't use a credit card?</h2> <p>With some of the so-called low-cost carriers applying absurdly high charges to anyone paying with a credit card, this is a case for using a debit card, and buying extra travel insurance to cover the failure of the airline for \u00a38 a year.</p> <h2>How do I go about getting my money back? </h2> <p>To make a credit card claim using Section 75, you can download an example template letter and get more detailed advice and guidance from <a href=\"http://www.consumerdirect.gov.uk\">consumerdirect.gov.uk</a> and 0845 404 0506.</p> <h2>Does the credit crunch mean there are bargains to be snapped up?</h2> <p>Look no further than new and used cars. The car trade is currently slower than a Robin Reliant with a flat tyre and dealers are taking silly offers just to keep the bank manager off their backs. Only super-minis are selling - big cars and 4x4s are at the lowest prices for years. Porsche sales during August were down more than 50%. If you've always longed for one, you may not get a better chance. Try <a href=\"http://www.cargiant.co.uk\">cargiant.co.uk</a> for used car deals and <a href=\"http://www.honestjohn.co.uk\">honestjohn.co.uk</a> for a list of cheapest deals on new cars. </p> <h2>What other bargains are out there?</h2> <p>With the property market in the doldrums, retailers who rely on house sales to bring people through the doors are prepared to do more than most for a sale. Furniture, carpets kitchens, bathrooms, even big TVs are all in a buyer's market. Shop around, haggle hard, and be prepared to walk away. And only pay with a credit card. </p> <h2>Should I be rushing to Aldi?</h2> <p>It's no surprise that local newspapers are full of ads showing how a family of four can eat for \u00a38. All the supermarkets have been forced to react to the so-called Aldi effect - the rise of the discount supermarket - by appearing to reduce prices. In truth, food prices in the UK soared 10% in the year to August as retailers pass on rising commodity costs. Expect to see plenty more fake discounting.</p> <h2>I'm already living on lentils, what else can I do?</h2> <p>If you're on your fourth bowl of dahl of the week, you've probably been through your personal finances with a fine-tooth comb. If you haven't, do it now. Plenty of households can save up to \u00a31,000 a year by cutting out waste. Switching car and home insurer can easily save \u00a3400. After that, switch to a cheaper broadband supplier, ditch the paid-for TV service, or that unused gym membership. Go through your monthly spend and you'll be amazed what you can cut. </p> <h2>I've just been made redundant. Where can I get a cheap suit?</h2> <p>Hot on the heels of the Asda's \"court appearance\" suit, Aldi has launched the \"credit crunch\" whistle. Its pinstripe business suit costs \u00a324.98 - trousers cost \u00a37.99 and jacket \u00a316.99. Aldi says it is washable, durable and unlike most cheap suits it is not 100% polyester.</p>",
  "<p>Amanda Knox got her first taste of the media storm she has created on Tuesday morning in a corridor in the bowels of Perugia's 15th century court house.</p> <p>The most notorious suspect in the killing of British student Meredith Kercher was on her way to a pre-trial hearing on her first public outing since her arrest. Photographers were desperate for a shot of the fresh-faced woman from Seattle, whose MySpace photos have fuelled coverage for 10 months.</p> <p>After those months in jail, Knox wore a white cotton blouse with lace trim and a trace of make-up over a tan acquired, presumably, during her one hour a day in the courtyard.</p> <p>\"Soap and water: the new Amanda,\" screamed the Italian press, suggesting the 21-year-old, Jesuit-educated student had thought long and hard about her wardrobe. Francesco Maresca, a lawyer representing Meredith Kercher's family, had no doubts. \"She came in looking like an angel, but it didn't work.\"</p> <p>It will now be up to the judge, Paolo Micheli, to decide whether there is enough evidence to send Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 24, to trial for the murder of her fellow student and housemate. Kercher, 21, a Leeds University student from Coulsdon, south London, was found semi-naked with her throat slashed, covered with a duvet in her locked bedroom on November 2.</p> <p>Sollecito, 24, an IT student who met Knox at a classical music concert, has sat his final exams in jail since his arrest.</p> <p>A third suspect, Ivory Coast migrant Rudy Guede, 21, who was arrested after fleeing to Germany, confessed to visiting Kercher on the night of her death and has now asked for a fast track trial, held beyond closed doors, which will deliver a verdict by the end of October, around the time Micheli will decide whether to send Knox and Sollecito to a full trial. All deny murder.</p> <p>On Tuesday a slimmed-down Knox was happy to hum Beatles tunes in court and hand out sweets to her lawyers. But she will reportedly attempt to dispel the image that a thousand articles and blogs have bestowed on her as a man-eater, as \"Foxy Knoxy\", the dope smoker who wrote short stories about rape and initially told police that she hazily remembered being in the house.</p> <p>She now claims she was with Sollecito, empathising over the death of his mother, on the night of Kercher's death.</p> <p>Knox's lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, will try to demolish the credibility of forensic evidence including Knox's blood and alleged footprints left at the cottage on the night of the murder. Investigators have not been idle either, presenting evidence of a bloody print of a knife left on Kercher's bed which could match a kitchen knife found at Sollecito's house which bears, they claim, traces of Knox's and Kercher's DNA.</p> <p>A homeless man, Antonio Curatolo, this week told British television that he saw Knox and Sollecito lurking near the scene of the crime on the night of November 1. In a twist, it has emerged Curatolo was a key witness in a murder trial involving a Tunisian who murdered his girlfriend in Perugia in 2001. </p> <p>Another witness lawyers are keen to discredit is Hekuran Kokomani, an Albanian who says he saw Knox, Sollecito and Guede in the street, but cannot be sure if it was on the night of the murder. Kokomani will take the stand at the opening of Guede's trial on September 26, an event Guede has prepared for by firing off a letter from his cell, denying he is a drug dealer, addict and criminal: \"What next? That I am a terrorist?\" </p> <p>Compared with the flow of letters and prison diaries from the accused and the TV appearances made by Knox's parents, Meredith's parents and sister Stephanie have restricted themselves to short tributes to her. \"Meredith was such a genuine person that when you think of her now and see her friends, you don't need to say anything, you only need to smile,\" said Stephanie, before the family got their first glimpse of Knox and Guede in court on Tuesday. </p> <p>The Kerchers have kept faith in the investigation, despite the leak of gruesome crime scene photos, part of a steady flow of titbits which has turned Kercher's murder into what Sollecito called \"a nightmare reality show\".</p> <p>After this week's hearing Italian television broadcast grainy mobile phone video footage, taken in secret inside the courtroom, of Knox humming during a pause in proceedings, proof of how fascination has built around the girl who has been discussed so much and photographed so little.</p>",
  "<p>The crisis over contaminated milk in China grew yesterday after government tests found the industrial chemical melamine in liquid milk produced by three leading dairy companies.</p> <p>The scandal had been thought to be confined to tainted milk powder, blamed for the deaths of four infants and illnesses in 6,200 others. </p> <p>But about 10% of liquid milk samples taken from Mengniu Dairy Group and Yili Industrial Group - the two largest dairy producers in China - contained melamine, according to a report by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine posted on the agency's website. Milk from Shanghai-based Bright Dairy also showed contamination.</p> <p>The agency will find out the reason for adding the melamine and punish those responsible, the notice said, adding that all the batches which had tested positive were being recalled.</p> <p>Hong Kong's two biggest grocery chains removed all milk made by Mengniu from shelves. On Thursday, the chains had recalled milk, yoghurt, ice cream and other products made by Yili. </p> <p>In Singapore, the sale and import of all Chinese dairy products was suspended yesterday after several items tested positive for a toxic chemical, widening a crisis over tainted food in China. </p> <p>Starbucks said that its 300 cafes in mainland China had withdrawn milk supplied by Mengniu. The company said no employees or customers had fallen ill from the milk.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Mengniu's chief executive officer, Niu Gensheng, vowed to create a clean dairy product market, saying \"if this thing cannot be properly dealt with, I'll resign,\" according to the financial magazine Caijing.</p> <p>The scandal began with complaints over milk powder by the Sanlu Group Co, one of China's best-known and most respected brands, but it quickly became a much larger issue as government tests found that one-fifth of the companies producing baby milk powder had melamine in their products.</p> <p>Though most of the dairy products involved are sold domestically, two of the companies exported products to five countries in Asia and Africa.</p> <p>On Friday, regulators for consumer product safety in the US, EU and China met to discuss safety issues and agree a joint strategy.</p> <p>In China, thousands of parents have filled hospitals, many hovering over infants hooked to IV drips after drinking formula tainted with melamine, which can lead to kidney failure. </p> <p>Some 1,300 babies, mostly newborns, remain in hospital, with 158 suffering from acute kidney failure.</p> <p>The crisis has raised questions about the effectiveness of the tighter controls China promised after recent safety scares over contaminated seafood, toothpaste and a pet food ingredient also tainted with melamine. </p> <p>In 2004, more than 200 Chinese infants suffered malnutrition and at least 12 died after being fed fake formula that contained no nutrients.</p>",
  "<p>\"The author of that taut masterpiece, Brokeback Mountain, has produced some disappointingly broken-backed novels,\" said <strong>Peter Kemp</strong> in the Sunday Times, reviewing Annie Proulx's Fine Just the Way It Is. \"In the short story, a form that demands selectivity and spareness, she comes into her own.\" \"These are meticulous, wonderfully actualised descriptions of small lives lived in a place that is lonely and unchanging, and heartbreakingly beautiful, and that is trying to kill you,\" wrote <strong>Sam Leith</strong> in the Daily Telegraph. \"In Proulx's Wyoming, your past is never over, and you are very unlikely to die anywhere so peaceful as a bed,\" observed <strong>Archie Bland</strong> in the Independent. \"This is relentless, barren and possibly malevolent country, and the real achievement of Fine Just The Way It Is is to transmit characters' strong sense of the conspiracy of their environment.\" Or, as<strong> Tim Adams</strong> put it in the Observer: \"This is the territory Proulx stakes out for herself. Who needs hell when you have Wyoming?\"</p> <p>\"What novelists call territory is one of the defining elements of fiction,\" said <strong>Russell Celyn Jones</strong> in the Financial Times. \"It is often so sacred to the writer, and so hard won, that it becomes a constant in their work . . . But it cannot be said of Andrew Miller. Each of his five novels embraces quite different territories. His latest, One Morning Like a Bird, is a rather exquisite Japanese imitation . . . yet the risk for such an audacious chameleon lies in the comparison he may face with the real deal: to writers who own their territory ethnically.\" \"The frank simplicity of Miller's prose, and his search for truth in the reality of the quotidian feels (to this western reader) convincingly Japanese,\" wrote <strong>Helen Brown</strong> in the Daily Telegraph. \"Miller places his words and plot developments carefully, like the smooth grey pebbles of a Zen garden.\" \"There are moments of delicate prose that clearly reach for the painterly effect of a Japanese screen,\" said <strong>Harriet Paterson</strong> in the Sunday Telegraph, \"but they are too sporadic to create an overall texture.\" \"The prose has been reduced in favour of a quieter, more brittle voice,\" wrote <strong>Natalie Sandison</strong> in the Times, \"that fits its aesthetic and works as an intellectual project but lacks the irresistible pull and flow of his previous novels.\" </p> <p>\"AN Wilson thinks the second Elizabethan age is when the United Kingdom lost its mojo,\" said <strong>Sam Leith</strong> (again) in the Spectator, reviewing Our Times. \"We gained material comfort but lost our identity as a nation . . . The established institutions of church and crown crumbled about us, the empire vanished and the skids went under the Union. Mass immigration brought a dissolving cultural pluralism. There is no longer, as Wilson sees it, a 'Britain' about which you can meaningfully say anything much at all.\" \"There is far too much bile in Our Times,\" wrote <strong>Roy Hattersley</strong> in the Times. \"But despite that blemish - cynical readers may say because of it - the story is told with a verve that catches the excitement of a turbulent era.\" \"The book often descends into fogeyish diatribe,\" said <strong>Piers Brendon</strong> in the Sunday Times, \"as if it were striving to become an extended think-piece for the Evening Standard. Moreover, written in far too much of a hurry, it is unpolished, repetitious, incoherent and woefully inaccurate.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Is gold still a safe haven and will the price now soar?</h2> <p>In just four hours after the US government bailed out AIG, the gold price jumped $60 an ounce - a rise of 12% - as jittery investors pulled their money out of risky equities and piled into the traditional safe haven. Some commentators are now predicting it will soon recover to the $1,000 an ounce peak it hit in March, and then go even higher.</p> <p>But memories of the last great boom still haunt the market. In 1980, gold hit $850, but what followed was a painful two-decade-long bear market. Not until 2001 did the price bottom out, at $250. Sadly, that was also when Gordon Brown was selling off Britain's gold reserves, achieving an average price of only $275 an ounce.</p> <p>Anybody who bought in March this year is also suffering hefty losses, with the bullion price 25% off its peak and the share price of gold mining companies down even further. Adrian Ash of BullionVault says: \"With US bonds yielding virtually zero, gold is looking very attractive.</p> <p>\"In general, it does well during periods of negative real interest rates, such as in the 70s, and a lot of people say we're heading that way again.\"</p> <p>There are various ways to buy gold:<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Funds: money goes into gold mining companies.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> ETFs: Exchange Traded Funds.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Coins: a full sovereign was selling for \u00a3112-\u00a3114 this week.</p> <p>Think that you might cash in on the soaring gold price by selling your old gold ring or watch? Plenty of scrap merchants (try Hatton Garden in London) will pay around pounds \u00a34 a gram. They'll even buy your old gold tooth. But don't go pulling it out - that old tooth of yours will probably fetch little more than a fiver.</p> <h2>Who gets the prize for \"I told you so\"?</h2> <p>In May 2007, when the property market was still fizzing and the stock market flourishing, Britain's leading \"star\" investment manager, Anthony Bolton of Fidelity, sold nearly all his bank and financial stocks, stating publicly that banks were risking defaults on a scale not seen for decades. He said a major correction in markets was inevitable, and criticised banks for stumping up billions in cheap credit for deals where the risks were not being priced in.</p> <p>Perhaps the most stoically pessimistic voice has been David Kauders, who runs a small financial advice business in Reading. He has been telling his investors for years that Britain's debt-fuelled prosperity is a mirage, that shares are wildly over-valued and the only safe home for your cash is government bonds.</p> <h2>Should I sell my shares?</h2> <p>Tough one. This week the FTSE fell below the 5,000 level for the first time since June 2005. Few people are willing to call the bottom of the market while banks are creaking so badly. </p> <p>The FTSE dropped to 3,500 after the dotcom crash, and commentators are unanimous in calling this a far worse crisis. One positive sign is that the yield (the annual dividend income) on leading shares is now higher than the yield on government bonds. That's a rare occurrence (usually during times of maximum market distress) and is often the sign of an impending recovery. But don't bet the house on it. </p> <p>At Societe Generale, strategist Albert Edwards says we're in an \"ice age\" in which equities could fall another 60%. \"We continue to find a growing number of people who agree that the current situation looks increasingly similar to Japan's post-bubble disaster. Actually, it's much worse,\" he says. Kauders says prepare yourself for dramatic interest rate falls, and predict gilts at 1% within five years.</p> <h2>Are collectables a better bet than shares?</h2> <p>\"Banks fall over, art triumphs,\" Sir Norman Rosenthal, former exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy, said this week after Damien Hirst's two-day auction at Sotheby's took off like a rocket. The hot money seems to be pouring out of hedge funds and into pickled unicorns and winged pigs.</p> <p>Chateau Margaux is not far behind. Fine wines have risen in price by 9.5% so far this year, according to the Liv-ex 100 Fine Wine Index. </p> <p>But if City bonuses plunge, the fall-out on collectables is likely to be severe. </p> <h2>I have \u00a37,000 in a shares ISA. Is it at risk?</h2> <p>Yes. The average UK equity income is down 19% over the past year, and the biggest fund used by small investors, Invesco Perpetual Income, is down 14%, so many people have already taken a hit. Unit trusts and investment trusts are not at risk of total collapse in the style of Lehman Brothers. Even if they are run by a financial institution which collapses, assets are always carefully ring-fenced and held in custody.</p> <h2>I want safety, not risk. Where do I invest?</h2> <p>Corporate bond funds are not totally safe - most have lost a couple of percent in value over the past year - but are a decent safe haven. Top performing funds include those from M&amp;G, Standard Life, Fidelity and Prudential. When interest rates fall, as they are predicted to do, they tend to perform relatively well. Another option is mix bonds and equities into a single fund. Big players include Invesco Perpetual's Distribution fund, Axa Global Distribution, Threadneedle Equity and Bond Defensive and JP Morgan's Cautious Total Return fund. </p> <h2>Are the things that blew up Lehman's and AIG sitting in my investment fund?</h2> <p>Highly unlikely. Most unit trusts and investment trusts are \"plain vanilla\" funds which don't use derivatives. But in recent years a few have begun to use hedge-fund style strategies which may expose them to greater risk. keep a close eye on \"exchange traded funds\". </p> <p>These have become a popular and cheap route for investors wanting to track not just share prices, but also commodities, especially gold. </p> <h2>If a unit trust goes under, what compensation do I get?</h2> <p>Investment funds are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, and payouts are more generous than for deposits at banks. The maximum is \u00a348,000 per person, made up of 100% of the first \u00a330,000 and 90% of the next \u00a320,000. Offshore investments are covered if you received advice from an firm authorised by the FSA. Firms outside the European Economic Area are unlikely to be covered.</p> <h2>I rely upon share dividends. Will they be paid this year?</h2> <p>Mostly yes, but in some cases no. A Merrill Lynch survey this week found that fund managers think that forecasts on corporate profits are hopelessly optimistic.</p> <p>Dividends from the banks will be shot to pieces, but there's plenty of \"safe haven\" sectors such as food, supermarkets, telecoms, oils and pharmaceuticals where profits are relatively immune from the credit crunch.</p> <h2>I bought a 'guaranteed' investment bond. How safe is the guarantee?</h2> <p>Only as good as the party issuing the guarantee. Given the near-collapse of a giant insurer such as AIG, the quality of these guarantees may be limited. Another risk is that guaranteed products frequently use derivatives to secure their return, and these may not turn out to be as safe as once promised.</p> <h2>I bought a property fund two years ago, which is doing badly. Is it time to bail out?</h2> <p>It's not looking good. Merrill Lynch says real estate is the sector currently most disliked by fund managers. Most of the money in property funds is invested in office blocks in the City and elsewhere, which are severely exposed to the fallout from the financial sector. After property, the next most hated sectors in the UK are technology, banks and retail. Globally, investors are also pulling away from emerging markets, commodities and Europe, where the risks of recession are now rising fast.</p> <h2>Will sterling fall further?</h2> <p>Again, the prognosis isn't good. Financial services make up a large part of Britain's economy, the housing market is tumbling, and households are massively indebted. They are all good reasons for selling sterling. But the other major currencies are little better; many commentators are saying that the euro is heading for a fall, while the dollar has already risen against sterling and may not have much further to gain.</p>",
  "<p>Union leaders yesterday buried the hatchet and rallied to Gordon Brown's side ahead of the party conference, claiming that his promise to clean up the City was a clear sign he was throwing off the shackles of \"New Labour\".</p> <p>Derek Simpson, the joint general secretary of Unite, Labour's biggest affiliate, also claimed triumphantly: \"The rump of \u00fcber Blairites that had called for a leadership election have no roots in Labour and have failed to win support for their coup - their grip on the party is slipping, and not before time.\"</p> <p>Denouncing so-called forces of conservatism within the party, Simpson claimed the existence of the rebel faction had been the main obstacle to a change in policy on housing, the NHS, and job and pension security. \"The rebels' rump had been calling for the same ideology and policies that had allowed big city bankers to gamble away our future prosperity.\"</p> <p>In an unrestrained assault, Simpson claimed: \"The spectacle of the political has-beens and never-weres queuing up to criticise the prime minister over the last few weeks has been pitiful.\"</p> <p>He hailed Brown for saying stronger regulation of the financial sector was essential and for recognising the struggle that millions of families faced with their winter household bills. \"There is a real sign now that Gordon Brown will throw off the shackles of New Labour and win back disaffected Labour voters.\" </p> <p>Simpson's outspoken attack came as Unite prepared to reveal that its outlay, to help Labour develop a more sophisticated direct mailshot service aimed at key marginal seats, had reached \u00a32m. </p> <p>Unite, looking at the close links between the unions and Democrats in the US, is also trying to invigorate its potentially key activists by regularly canvassing members by phone and email in all the marginal constituencies. </p> <p>In Glenrothes, the site of a byelection for Brown in November, Unite activists are already regularly phoning their 4,000 members. The union has also surveyed 100,000 of its members by post and phone in marginal seats to check out the disaffection with Labour and the issues likely to bring them back to the fold.</p> <p>The union survey revealed that 77% of its members had voted Labour at some point, but now only 40% backed the government as opposed to 23% who claimed to be Conservatives. Asked to rank issues in order of importance, those surveyed put immigration top (25%), hospitals second (22%) alongside crime, then the economy (19%), followed by pensions, housing and education. The high number citing immigration was regarded as an embarrassment in some parts of the union, but others saw the issue as a symbol of a wider resentment against unfairness.</p> <p>Labour leaders are expecting the conference to reveal a big swell of support for Brown, following the attacks from rebels, and in recognition of his handling of the financial crisis. But they admit that the tests for him will come in the content of his speech on Tuesday, and in his ability to keep his parliamentary party united afterwards. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, ruffled feathers in the cabinet when she openly backed the Democrats in the US presidential election during an appearance on BBC Question Time. One cabinet source said it was not acceptable for the deputy leader to call for party discipline and then veer away from the agreed position of neutrality. </p> <p>The day after his speech the prime minister is going to New York for a meeting of the UN special general assembly where he will see several key leaders, including George Bush and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to discuss the financial crisis. He is also expected to discuss the possibility of kick-starting the world trade talks, though few expect any progress until after the US elections in November.</p>",
  "<p>A far-right group was forced to abandon a press conference launching a campaign against plans for a new mosque and Muslim immigration in the German city of Cologne yesterday, when protesters targeted them with stones and paint.</p> <p>\"Mosques are shooting out of the ground like mushrooms\" and \"headscarves are flooding our streets\", were among the inflammatory statements the Pro-Cologne group used to drum up support for its three-day \"Anti-Islamisation Conference\".</p> <p>But the talks were disrupted early on when stone-throwing protesters pelted a boat on the Rhine River, the stage for the opening press conference, eventually forcing organisers to scrap the event. Windows were smashed and police arrested six people.</p> <p>Nearby around 500 of the protesters formed a human chain to defend the site where the city plans to build the mosque, Germany's largest, complete with two 55 metre-high (180ft) minarets.</p> <p>Pro-Cologne has run a vociferous campaign against the development, winning it a degree of local support and some seats on the city council.</p> <p>According to organisers, the aim of the conference was to forge a \"European, patriotic, populist rightwing movement\" by uniting far-right speakers and supporters from across Europe. Among plans for yesterday was a tour of \"multi-ethnic hotspots\".</p> <p>German government officials spoke out against the talks, saying it would be divisive for the city where more than a third of the 1 million residents are not German, but mostly of Turkish origin. \"Such an event organised by populists and extremists in Cologne is damaging to the good cooperation between the city and its Muslim citizens,\" Gabriele Hermani, a spokeswoman for the interior ministry, said.</p> <p>Islamic nations, including Iran, also called for the event to be banned, saying it reflected a \"growth of anti-Islamic sentiment in Europe\".</p> <p>Counter-protests, organised by charities, Muslim groups and trade unions, are expected to dwarf tomorrow's far-right demonstration at the site of the new mosque, which is the centrepiece of the Pro-Cologne rally. </p> <p>In what police described as one of their \"most difficult assignments\", 3,000 officers from all over the state of North Rhine-Westphalia were being sent to Cologne. Yesterday, police arrested protesters on both sides and stepped in to shield a man of foreign appearance who was chased by far-right protesters.</p> <p>The rally has put Cologne at the centre of a heated debate in Germany about Islam and integration, to the dismay of mainstream politicians.</p> <p>Cologne's mayor, Fritz Schramma, sent a strong message to the city to shun the far-right: \"Shut your windows and doors, lower your shutters,\" he said. \"Make it clear to Pro-Cologne and its camarilla: You are not welcome in Cologne.\"</p>",
  "<p>'Alto Al Desplazamiento\" - Stop The Gentrification - reads the colourful mural by Mexican artist Hector Duarte. It adorns one of many lavish buildings between the 16th and 18th streets in Pilsen, Chicago's most up-and-coming neighbourhood. What's surprising is that it was painted back in 1994, when Pilsen, on the city's Lower West Side - historically rather isolated - had been in economic decline for years. </p> <p>There's one man who can be blamed and praised in equal measure for the dreaded \"G\" word. As far back as the 1970s, local property developer John Podmajersky began converting old warehouses into cheap studios for creatives and turning abandoned alleys into communal courtyards. Now, however, it buzzes mostly with \"white artsy types and a recent influx of yuppie bastards\", according to local artist Nat Ward. And it's fair to say that the family business, taken over by Podmajersky's son (also John) in 2000, while effectively dominating the art scene (and hosting \"open house\" events, see 4), has won both friends and foes: reviving an area means raised rents, alas, causing some of the original artists and other residents to move away. </p> <p>But then Pilsen has always been characterised by transience. Named after the city in Bohemia by Czech immigrants in the mid 19th-century (who built Pilsen's St Procopius Church and the Schoenhofen Brewery), in the 1920s it gave way to an influx of Mexicans who gave the area its current character with murals advocating civil rights. It's this prevalent Mexican culture, as well as the more recent galleries, that make a stroll along the 18th a genuine thrill. Every two or three storefronts is a taqueria (family Mexican restaurant). Houses are painted bright colours or decorated with large plastic floral arrangements, while men in cowboy hats and rodeo shirts, or mariachis in elaborate outfits, play in the street as they make their way between restaurants for weekend gigs. </p> <h2>1. The National Museum of Mexican Art</h2> <p>Founded in 1982, NMMA is the nation's largest Latino arts institution and a vital component of Pilsen's culture. Don't miss Mexicanidad: Our Past is Present, a permanent exhibition exploring the history of Mexico in five stages, as well as the tradition behind the murals in Pilsen (for mural photos see <a href=\"http://tamalechica.blogspot.com/2008/07/pilsen-murals-walking-tour.html\">tamalechica.blogspot.com</a>). The museum is also the focus of the annual Day Of The Dead festival (Nov 1 &amp; 2), with a preceding exhibition each October, and is where the yearly procession ends. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 1852 W 19th Street, at S Damen Avenue (001 312 738 1503, <a href=\"http://www.nationalmuseumofmexicanart.org\">nationalmuseumofmexicanart.org</a>).</p> <h2>2. Cafe Jumping Bean </h2> <p>\"Chicago's most inviting coffee shop,\" is what they say. And jumping is the right word as, with its orange walls, pink chairs and quirkily-painted tables, it's not only eye-boggling but packed to the rafters. Try the liquados, Mexican drinks made with milk, sugar, ice, and fresh fruit (the mango is yummy). Sculptor Kenneth Morrison designed the space and built the counter, in exchange for \"a year's free coffee and bagels\". Owners Eleazar and his sister Sylvia are also a great source of info about what's going on in the neighbourhood, particularly among the Mexican artistic community. It also has monthly shows of local artists. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 1439 W 18th St (+312 455 0019).</p> <h2>3. OMD </h2> <p>Vintage stores abound in an area of few chains. Revolver (1524 W 18th St, +312 226 4211), a second-hand record shop, is a must for those wishing to re-enact High Fidelity moments (the movie was filmed in Pilsen, after all), but the epicentre of hip, according to locals, is OMD, which flogs designer garb, fragrances, and T-shirts by local designers Sharp Chicago, bearing emblems such as \"Kiss Me I'm Mexican\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 1419 W 18th St (+312 563 9663, <a href=\"http://www.omdchicago.com\">omdchicago.com</a>).</p> <h2>4. Vespine</h2> <p>\"Chicago has a structured and non-structured art scene,\" says artist Derek Erdman (<a href=\"http://www.derekerdman.com\">derekerdman.com</a>). \"Here people support renegade galleries but it's still a big enough city to have a respected official gallery scene.\" Most East Pilsen galleries fall into the former category, including the acclaimed Vespine - specialising in emerging artists - which is open on Fridays and Saturdays, but closed (or appointment only) Monday to Thursday. One of the best times to visit is for the free \"Second Fridays\" (second Friday of each month, 6pm-10pm) when every gallery opens up for browsing. Even more enjoyable is the Annual Artists' Open House (this year Sept 26-28, Friday 6pm-10pm, Sat and Sun noon-7pm) in which a host of local bands perform and the whole community turns out to party. Both are organised by Podmajersky jnr.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 1907 S Halstead (<a href=\"http://www.vespine.org\">vespine.org</a>) Second Fridays/Annual <br>Open House <a href=\"http://www.chicagoartsdistrict.org/events\">chicagoartsdistrict.org/events</a>_main.asp.</p> <h2>5. Skylark</h2> <p>\"My advice to a brave tourist in Pilsen,\" says local artist Nat Ward, \"is to walk around the neighbourhood before sunset, wandering into any dive bar you see, then come back later to the ones where you got the warmest welcome.\" If that sounds too much like hard work, one place you'll fit right in with the black-jeaned, shaggy-haired hipster types is Skylark, a boho bar at the southern edge of Pilsen and the gallery scene. It's a huge room with a 1930s bar on one side and booths on the other, not to mention seriously skilled bartenders. The menu offers pub-style burgers, tater tots (hash browns) and specials such as leg of lamb or pan-seared maki with mango rice.

May St Caf\u00e9</h2> <p>Despite its simple interior and BYOB policy, chef Mario Santiago's \"gourmet seasonal\" blend of American, Mexican and Puerto Rican has been earning rave reviews. Particularly recommended is the brie-and-pear quesadillas, spicy shrimp diabla pasta, salmon with lemon butter and chipotle-tequila cream sauce, and pumpkin or mango flan. If it's a credit crunch feed you're after, head to 1103 West 18th Street for the street vendors' awesome elotes (corn on the cob with mayonnaise, butter, crumbled chihuahua cheese and cayenne pepper) and diabolitos (a layered tamarind drink that is hot and salty and sweet).</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 1146 W Cermak Rd, 18th Pink Line, (+312 421 4442, <a href=\"http://www.maystcafe.com\">maystcafe.com</a>).</p>",
  "<p>Having saddled four of the last eight winners of the John Smith's Ayr Gold Cup, Dandy Nicholls is the trainer synonymous with Scotland's leading sprint handicap. But, from far fewer runners in the race, Karl Burke has also established a good record and he can register his third big-race win today with Confuchias.</p> <p>Burke has not had a runner in the Ayr Gold Cup since 2000, but he completed a 1-2 in 1998 to follow up his victory four years earlier. <strong>Confuchias (3.30)</strong> was Irish-trained last season, when his best performance came in testing ground at Newcastle where he beat Appalachian Trail and Fonthill Road in a Group Three sprint. </p> <p>Well handicapped on that form, the four-year-old showed he was ready to show his best for the Burke stable when finishing fourth in the Great St Wilfrid at Ripon last month. He was first home on the stands' side but no match for Tajneed, Valery Borzov and Tamagin, who dominated the finish on the favoured far rail. </p> <p>Low numbers came out best in yesterday's Silver Cup here. There is no guarantee the pattern will be repeated, although last year's winner Advanced could go well as he will get a lead from his front-running stablemate Tamagin on the far side.</p> <p><strong>Ayr 2.20</strong> Danehill Destiny is the form choice but she could be isolated from her low draw. Near the stands' side, <strong>Riotista</strong> can make a bold bid, having run a good third behind Madame Trop Vite on only her second start. She is by Captain Rio, whose progeny revel in soft ground. </p> <p><strong>Newbury 2.35</strong> Marine Boy, so impressive on his debut here, may not have been suited by softer ground in the Gimcrack Stakes next time. He may well bounce back, but will have to be at the top of his game to get the better of <strong>Gallagher</strong>, who had Lord Shanakill back in third spot when making Bushranger pull out all the stops in the Group One Prix Morny. </p> <p><strong>Ayr 2.50</strong> Heavy ground specialist Zero Tolerance will be popular, but it is worth taking the chance that <strong>Underworld</strong> handles conditions. The gelding had a dreadful run when not beaten far at Chester last time. </p> <p><strong>Newbury 3.10</strong> This galloping track can bring out the best in Rose Street, who looks the danger to <strong>Ask The Butler</strong>. He is unbeaten in three runs over this distance since joining Luca Cumani and performed better than ever when winning a strongly contested handicap Sandown. </p> <p><strong>Newbury 3.45</strong> Winner of three of his four starts over this course and distance, <strong>Green Manalishi</strong> looks worth following in his current form. </p> <p><strong>Newmarket 3.50</strong> The step up to 10 furlongs is not expected to prove a problem for <strong>Grande Annee</strong>. Jeremy Noseda's progressive filly looks capable of defying the handicapper again.</p> <h2>Ron Cox's tip of the day</h2> <p><strong>Nasri</strong> 2.05 Newbury</p> <p>Brian Meehan had the option of running this colt in the Group Two Mill Reef Stakes on this card, but he leaves that to Gallagher and can pick up this valuable prize with Nasri, who looks leniently treated off 83. The form of his course-and-distance win has worked out, with runner-up Definightly, who reopposes on the same terms here, going on to win next time at Folkestone.</p> <h2>Horse sense</h2> <p><strong>Cumani's Presvis makes plenty of each-way appeal</strong></p> <p>Presvis (3.10) may not be first choice in the betting among trainer Luca Cumani's three runners in the John Smith's Handicap at Newbury today, but our Newmarket contact rates this four-year-old an excellent each-way bet.</p> <p>Peter Chapple-Hyam runs a useful prospect in Gibb River, but the colt may not be sharp enough first time. That is not the case with Splendorinthegrass (4.20). Roger Charlton's juvenile has done good work with some of the stable's recent winners.</p> <p>Skanky Biscuit (1.35) is the one to note in the Newbury opener. His trainer, Brian Meehan, should also go close with Nasri (2.05) and Gallagher (2.35). Cat Junior has the form to win the John Smith's Conditions Stakes, but Jeremy Noseda's Acclaimed (4.55) could be a bit special. Late news from Newmarket yesterday suggested stable companion Without Prejudice should not be opposed in the 2.10.</p> <p>Montbretia (3.15) should be spot on for her return to action at Newmarket. She has looked strong in recent work, a remark which also applies to unraced stablemate Alpha Tauri. Ave and Red Spider are other two-year-olds to note.</p> <p>Mannlichen (1.45) is expected to be suited by the testing ground at Ayr. Conditions are certainly right for Zomerlust (4.05), who was balloted out of the Ayr Gold Cup. Over jumps tomorrow, there is a strong word for Cortinas (3.50) at Uttoxeter, and Tuanku (2.00), a recent winner on the Flat, is expected to make a winning bow over hurdles at Plumpton.</p> <p>Mia's Boy is virtually ignored in ante-post betting on the Cambridgeshire, but we are advised to put Chris Dwyer's four-year-old on the short-list. Mia's Boy shaped well after a lay-off when fifth behind Virtual at Doncaster last week.</p> <h2>Seen and heard</h2> <p>Spiritofthewest, backed from 100-1 down to 33-1, landed one of the gambles of the year on an eventful afternoon at Beverley on Wednesday. The colt is trained by Stewart Parr, whose landlord Willie McKay was there to greet the winner, who runs in the colours of owners Bezwell Fixings. What rotten luck Parr was denied the chance of a double when Haajes, owned by McKay, was unable to run in the following race, jockey John Egan having discarded the horse's saddle on the way to the start when he reported Haajes had gone lame.</p> <p>By sheer good luck, no one was seriously injured when Bespoke Boy ran loose in the paddock prior to Haajes' intended race. The panicked horse might well have caused even more dramatic copy from reporters - Bespoke Boy finally ended up in the grandstand, but was only a foot or so away from entering the press room.</p> <p>Jumps trainers open days are well under way, and it will be a busy time in the Lambourn valley tomorrow when Nicky Henderson, Charlie Mann and Henrietta Knight all open their doors. Exciting prospects such as Petit Robin will be on parade at Henderson's, but there is likely to be as much interest in the stable's new jockey signing, Barry Geraghty, who will be in attendance on a blank day for racing in Ireland.</p>",
  "<p>In this presidential election, the west is supposed to be a <a href=\"http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/out_west_land_of_opportunity_for_the_democrats/C530/L37/\">battleground region in presidential politics</a>. That's not a bad assumption, given the <a href=\"http://pollster.com/\">polls</a>: New Mexico tilts towards Obama; Colorado, Montana, and Nevada are deadlocked; and Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, and Arizona tilt towards McCain.</p> <p>Barack Obama is taking the region seriously. In Montana, for example, his campaign has at least <a href=\"http://www.flatheadbeacon.com/articles/article/the_ground_game/5106/\">16 offices</a>, the candidate has visited the state five times and his vice presidential selection, Joe Biden <a href=\"http://www.abc2news.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=82486a57-0e9b-4b14-97f4-28c1b0a9d5a0\"> visited the state</a> shortly after the Democratic convention.</p> <p>So what did candidates say in their respective conventions to woo western voters?</p> <p>While access to, and rights to use, water is probably the biggest issue affecting westerners, both candidates steered clear of that particular issue. And probably wisely so \u2013 <a href=\"http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761589807/water_policy_in_the_american_west.html\">water rights in the west</a> is a big, tangled, bureaucratic mess and a very sensitive topic. When John McCain called to renegotiate water rights among Western states, for example, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12697.html\">all hell broke loose</a>. \"Over my cold, dead, political carcass,\" said Colorado candidate for Senate, <a href=\"http://www.bobschafferforsenate.com/\">Bob Schaffer</a>. And that was the Republican candidate.</p> <p>Energy is a close second to water as an issue in western states. Most of the west was founded on, and continues to support itself by, the extraction of coal, oil, gas and timber. Because much of the western lands are state owned, leasing state land brings revenue to the state, usually to its rural school systems. Add that to the fact that the base of the western Democratic party was forged in the unions working in western mines and lumber mills, and there's tremendous pressure on both parties to ease environmental restrictions and promote drilling and mining. </p> <p>The Republicans, who receive much of their support from the corporate entities that run these industries, are strong advocates for drilling. In her speech at the Republican convention, Sarah Palin touted her state's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/us/politics/11pipeline.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1221837170-H161Vik77+NqW1k9l3otbg\">plan to construct natural gas pipeline</a> as a gain for US energy independence. She offered up her state's oil fields for drilling to aid in the cause against terrorism. When Republican presidential nominee John McCain during his <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/09/john_mccains_acceptance_speech.html\">nomination acceptance speech</a> promised to \"drill new wells offshore and drill them now,\" the Convention crowd interrupted him with a chant of, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhvRQyRdVEI\">\"drill, baby, drill\"</a>.</p> <p>The Democrats took a softer tone, but they still promoted the use of oil and coal in US energy independence. Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer was assigned the task of explaining the Democrats' energy policy, and did so in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNHysr_IluI\">a speech</a> that brought the Convention to its feet. He outlined a program that promoted alternative energy sources and conservation \u2013 but also promoted domestic drilling and the use of clean coal. Likewise, Barack Obama promised to \"tap our natural gas reserves\" and use \"clean coal\" as part of a plan to complete energy independence within a decade.</p> <p>Still, the thrust of the Democrats' message was that alternative energy and conservation should play a central \u2013 not subservient \u2013 role in a future US energy policy. Schweitzer's speech laid out a vision of a diverse set of energy sources for America that included wind, solar, geothermal and hydrogen in addition to coal and oil. Also, conservation is key. As Schweitzer put it, \"Barack Obama understands the most important barrel of oil is the one you don't use\". Obama reiterated his desire to center an energy plan around alternative energy sources, along with biofuel and nuclear power and conservation in part through increased mileage standards for cars.</p> <p>That doesn't play out as poorly as you'd think in western states. Because alongside the pressures in places like Montana, Wyoming and Colorado to drill and mine, a conservation ethic has emerged \u2013 to the Democrats' benefit \u2013 that seeks to protect the states' quickly vanishing wild places. As political writer David Sirota recently pointed out in the New York Times, the recent history of Republican-backed unfettered drilling has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/magazine/18wwln-phenomenon-t.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogi\">driven westerners to the Democratic party</a>, because Democrats \"have found success recasting environmentalism as a defense of threatened water supplies, fishing spots and hunting grounds\". If drilling and mining brings revenue, then a Democratic party with a conservation ethic needs to propose use of state lands that both generates revenue and preserves the west's open spaces, lest the region fall back into the hands of pro-corporate conservatives who argue that environmentalism costs jobs. </p> <p>And that's where alternative energy sources come in.</p> <p>The high plains of the Rocky Mountains offer two resources that promise to make it the center of future of alternative energy production: <a href=\"http://thefraserdomain.typepad.com/energy/2008/05/land-for-larges.html\">wind and switchgrass</a>. Eastern Montana, for example, is one of the windiest spots in the country. If the state can build the infrastructure of high-transmission power lines to transfer the energy produced by gigantic wind farms, the state could become a major supplier of clean energy. Likewise, Montana's climate supports the kind of grasses used in the production of <a href=\"http://www.carboncommentary.com/2008/01/14/71\">cellulosic biofuels</a>, the alternative to corn-based biofuels. Harvesting switchgrass would require neither irrigation, or force our food supply to compete for corn, and it could ease the country's switch from a fuel-burning transportation infrastructure.</p> <p>The Republicans' cries of \"drill, baby, drill\" harkens back to the 1980s, when conservatives pointed to economically depressed mining and timber communities and successfully pinned the blame on environmentalists seeking to protect endangered habitat. Now the question is whether westerners will fall back into old habits and vote to bring back the oil rigs, or will they grasp the conservationist and long-term approach of the Democratic plan? </p> <p>I'm guessing the latter. Not out of any nod towards collective human intelligence, but because today's economic climate in the west is vastly different than in the 1980s, when the Republican rhetoric was so successful. In fact, during the recent economic downturn, the job rate in the west was still relatively unaffected: in this <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/state_unemployment/\">CNN June report</a>, the Dakotas, Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico all ranked in the top ten for unemployment rates. Montana was close behind at fifteen and Colorado finished in the top half. </p> <p>Still, while employment is up, so is the cost of living. What's likely to be at the top of westerners' minds isn't jobs, but the rising cost of housing, healthcare and food.</p>",

McCain is particularly going after Latinos living in battleground states. The 30-second TV ad is airing in three key southwest states where a big turnout by Latinos could help swing the election: Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. </p> <p>Coming late in the campaign, McCain's ad constitutes the worst kind of pandering. Here's a man who went against his party's wishes to co-sponsor the bill in the first place, then, in an apparent move to pander to conservative white voters, has consistently disowned the bill on the presidential campaign trail, repeatedly saying that he wouldn't vote for it if it came up again. Now he has changed his tune again - apparently hoping that the Spanish-language ad hits home with Latinos but goes unnoticed by the mainstream. Ironic.</p> <p>Four years ago, the Republicans deep-sixed Democratic candidate John Kerry by labelling him a flip-flopper on important issues, but it is McCain who could teach a course on the subject.</p> <p>The Spanish ad may work on some Latino voters, but it won't be enough to sway most, who overwhelmingly decry the current administration's brutal enforcement policies, including <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/us/26raid.html\">workplace raids</a> in which thousands of illegal workers have been rounded up and summarily dumped in detention centres to await deportation. The feds have racked up a few thousand arrests via the raids, but have wreaked untold havoc on Latino families. Parents and their US-born children have been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/17/AR2007031701113.html\">separated</a> due to the raids and deportations, which are covered extensively on the same Spanish-language TV networks on which McCain's ads are running. I'm betting those images are a lot more powerful.</p>",
  "<p>1O DOWNING STREET <br>LONDON, SW1A 2AA </p> <p>THE PRIME MINISTER </p> <p>Dear colleague, <br> As we head to our conference in Manchester, our focus is upon helping <br>the British people come through this turbulent economic time, and on our defining mission of building a fairer Britain \u2013 winning the fight for Britain's <br>future. <br> <br>This week's international financial turbulence has shown that we are <br>going through a period of extraordinary global change that is taking us <br>into a new world. In this country we will take the tough, decisive action <br>necessary to protect the stability of the economy and to get the financial <br>system moving, as we have done this week and as we did with Northern <br>Rock. <br> <br>Our first task is immediate support for hard-pressed families struggling <br>with the impact of this global financial turbulence. That is why this month <br>we have been helping families with: <br> <br>\u2022 A comprehensive \u00a31 billion housing package that helps first- <br>time buyers; a one-year Stamp Duty holiday for all homes costing <br>under \u00a3175,000; and to help vulnerable homeowners in difficulty, <br>a new mortgage rescue scheme and a more generous safety net <br>to help prevent repossessions. <br> <br>\u2022 Help for families to reduce their energy bills \u2013 not just this <br>winter but permanently \u2013 with a \u00a31 billion increase in our national <br>programme for household energy efficiency. We have pledged to <br>increase: <br>a) the winter fuel payment by \u00a350 to all pensioners (and an <br>extra \u00a3100 for the over 80s) this winter; <br>b) eleven million older and vulnerable people will be eligible for <br>free loft and cavity wall insulation and other energy saving <br>measures that could save them up to \u00a3300 a year in their <br>energy bills. Every household will be eligible to get at least <br>50% off energy saving insulations. <br>c) Cold weather payments for the most vulnerable from \u00a38.50 <br>to \u00a325 a week. <br> <br>And we will encourage people to save an average of \u00a3150 per <br>household on pre-payment meters and \u00a3100 for households on <br>standard credit by switching suppliers and moving to direct debit, <br>in addition to the up to \u00a3300 of savings they can make through <br>energy efficiency measures. To make sure people across the <br>country can take advantage of the help on offer and save as much <br>money as possible, we will run a national TV and press information <br>campaign to publicise what help is available. <br> <br>\u2022 A \u00a3120 family tax cut that begins to come into force this <br>month. <br> <br>And as we face the challenges that change brings, we must restate the <br>case for our party and values. Fairness matters more at a time of <br>profound change such as this. <br> <br>Fair rules, fair chances, and a fair say for everyone: that is the new <br>deal for this new world. <br> <br>Fair rules with our tough measures to punish and prevent crime; with <br>neighbourhood policing a reality in our local communities; the new points <br>based system for immigration and new tougher, but fairer rules for <br>citizenship; and welfare reform so that those who can work, do work. <br> <br>Fair chances by investing in education and skills for all our people; help <br>for older people; and new support for parents to help ease the pressures <br>of bringing up children. <br> <br>And a fair say for all with a new approach to public services to give <br>parents, patients and the public greater control over the services they <br>use; a new wave of NHS reform to make the National Health Service a <br>personal health service; and accelerated schools reform. <br> <br>As we work to build a fairer Britain, we face a Conservative Party that <br>has changed its image, but has not undertaken a serious reappraisal of <br>policy or ideology. They have followed a deliberate strategy of avoiding <br>difficult policy choices but when they do make decisions, we see their <br>instincts still lead them down the road of policies that are unchanged and <br>unfair: <br> <br>\u2022 On tax, their first priority is to divert \u00a31 billion to the 3,000 richest <br>estates in Britain; <br> <br>\u2022 On levels of investment in public services, David Cameron says <br>the differences between Labour and the Tories will be 'dramatic' <br>and 'fundamental'. And they have committed to cuts to Sure Start <br>and to cut \u00a34.5 billion from school building plans; <br> <br>\u2022 And on tackling poverty, they refuse to commit to Labour's target <br>on child poverty and the means by which we are cutting child <br>poverty. <br> <br>I am confident that we can come through this difficult time and meet the <br>challenges we face a stronger, more secure, and fairer country than <br>before. <br> <br>And that we can show people more clearly that the choice at the next <br>election will be between a Conservative Party which still believes in <br>helping the few and not the many; and a Labour Party which believes in <br>fairness and opportunity for all and has the policies to deliver them. <br> <br>Yours sincerely, <br> <br>GORDON BROWN MP</p>",

Institutions that fail to follow the rules risk a ban on receiving international students.</p> <p>Students will also have to meet new criteria before they can travel. These include registration of their fingerprints, sponsorship from a registered institution and proof that they can financially support themselves and their families. They are barred from working while they are studying, but those who graduate from universities will be allowed to work in the UK for up to two years.</p> <p>\"It is right that foreign students wanting to take advantage of our world class universities and colleges must meet strict criteria,\" said the immigration minister, Liam Byrne. \"By locking people into identity with ID cards, alongside a tough new sponsorship system, we will know exactly who is coming here and crack down on bogus colleges.\"</p> <p>Students wanting to enrol on courses of less than six months, such as those offered by English language schools, will continue to apply for student visitor visas.</p> <h2>Australia offers East Timor learning help</h2> <p>The Australian government has refused East Timor's request to be included in a guest worker programme, but offered a package of education support projects, including help with English language teaching, to compensate south-east Asia's poorest country.</p> <p>Leaders of both countries announced the education, training and employment scheme in Canberra last month. The training will focus on relieving the problems of mass youth unemployment. Australia will also send specialists to Dili to help improve the quality of the country's politicised civil servants.</p> <p>The East Timorese government's willingness to accept help from Australia to raise English language levels is evidence that the debate in the country about whether Portuguese or English should take precedence as its second language has swung against the former colonial tongue.</p> <h2>NZ language schools enjoy exchange-rate bounce</h2> <p>English language schools in New Zealand have bucked the general mood of economic gloom by reporting a second year of rising foreign student spending.</p> <p>The government's statistics office has reported that spending by foreign students at English language schools increased by NZ$7m ($4.5m) in the year to March 2008.</p> <p>The sector says that the growth is partly due to the lower value of the New Zealand dollar, which has attracted South Korean students in particular.</p>",
  "<p>By way of <a href=\"http://londonsays.org/?p=214\">London Says</a>, the business case for immigration <a href=\"http://www.london-first.co.uk/documents/Immigration_briefing_FINAL.pdf\">made (pdf)</a> by London First:</p> <blockquote> <p>In recent years, a flexible labour market has enabled us to recruit workers internationally to make up for the shortfall in London's workforce caused by skills shortages and a declining working age population. Migrant workers fill roles essential to maintain London's world city status.</p> </blockquote> <p>It worries about the new restrictions on non-EU migrants, wants the points system better explained, the London workforce upskilled and better data to help the boroughs cope. The stats are interesting: 40% of immigrants come to London which has grown by 800,000 people since 1998; nearly 400,000 jobs have been created in this time of which nearly 90 percent have been filled by people born outside the UK; nearly a third of London's population were born overseas and by 2026 there could be over a million more people living here. A world in one city indeed. </p>",
  "<p>Standing in the kitchen of a small apartment in outer-suburban Melbourne, Htoo and his wife Gana are reading aloud from an English textbook, helped by their volunteer tutor Narelle. The language is clear and easy to understand, but when they put the book away and sit down to speak about their progress with learning English, things get much more difficult.</p> <p>With the help of a translator, Htoo and Gana explain that they, like thousands of refugees belonging to the Karen ethnic group, fled Burma in 1990. They spent 15 years in a refugee camp on the western border of Thailand, where their daughter was born, before being accepted for resettlement in Australia in 2007. </p> <p>In many ways they are the new face of Australia's long-running Australian Migrant English Programme (Amep) which, 60 years after it was founded, is struggling to deliver functional English to a changing, and swelling, cohort of arrivals. Amep has seen client numbers increase from 37,000 in 2004 to more than 50,000 this year, a third of whom are resettling under the programme's humanitarian stream. </p> <p>This changing demographic has sparked a major review of the Amep programme that will lead to a complete re-tendering for provision of teaching services from 2010. In a discussion paper released in July, the recently renamed Department of Immigration and Citizenship reports that: \"An audit undertaken by Ernst &amp; Young in 2007 noted that the current strategic goal and objectives of the programme do not align.\" </p> <p>Htoo and Gana have completed the standard 510 hours of tuition provided for all non-English-speaking- background (Nesb) migrants, but are clearly having trouble communicating in spoken English. </p> <p>Michelle de Courcy, senior lecturer and postgraduate coordinator for Tesol at the University of Melbourne, said this was a familiar scenario: \"The decoding skills required for reading aloud are relatively easy to acquire, and we often encounter Karen people with very large and complex vocabularies, but not the links required to put them together for interpersonal communication.\" </p> <p>The Amep review discussion paper notes: \"A major criticism of the Amep is a lack of distinction between client groups and a 'one-size-fits-all' approach in providing English tuition.\" </p> <p>De Courcy, who with the Australian Council of Tesol Associations is making a submission to the Amep review, explained: \"The Amep programme may have been appropriate for earlier highly schooled, highly literate cohorts, but you have to look at exactly who is making up the classes \u2014 a good example is the Sudanese migrants arriving in the past few years. You need to look at whether they're from southern Sudan, the Dinka, whose language doesn't really have a written form, or those from the Muslim north who have to be literate in Arabic to be able to read the Koran.\"</p> <p>Another facet of the problem is that the programme has long been promoted as a pathway into employment, despite the fact that 56% of migrants arrive under the \"family\" stream and many of them are too old to work. This is now being addressed in the Amep review, which proposes to create two distinct pathways: \"Settlement for Employment Participation\" and \"Settlement for Social Participation\".</p> <p>Perhaps more importantly for groups such as the Karen, the review discussion paper raised the issue of the number of hours of tuition that will deliver basic functional English. </p> <p>It stated: \"The 510 hours entitlement is not based on any estimate of the time needed to reach proficiency in English. It was derived by averaging the hours that Amep clients spent in the programme irrespective of educational background.\" It also notes that Canada and the UK \"do not cap the number of hours of English language training offered to eligible clients\".</p> <p>The report cites recent research that suggests \"the learning of another language requires on average 1,800 hours\". While this is a laudable objective, such a large and expensive increase in hours for 50,000 migrants a year looks unlikely.</p> <p>Where government funding falls short, charities do their best to bridge the gap. In the case of Htoo and Gana, and the four other adult Karen with whom they share their weekly classes, the charity is The Smith Family, which runs a language programme known as Each One Teach One (Eoto). </p> <p>While the scheme itself is not new \u2014 it was founded in Sydney in 1971 largely to help socially isolated migrant women \u2014 it is now attempting to expand in Melbourne to help refugees falling through the Amep net.</p> <p>Since 2006 it has expanded into five of Melbourne's poorer suburbs, funded through individual and corporate donations and with all tutoring done on a volunteer basis. \"Finding the tutors is the ongoing issue,\" said Eoto coordinator, Lisa Miller, \"though we'll never run out of students.\"</p> <p>In addition to face-to-face tutoring, it links students to English speaking \"mentors\" by phone, sending each a copy of the same book to read aloud during three 20-minute sessions a week. \"One big problem is that they need a landline to call their mentors, which many of them can't afford. Some have mobile phones, but the calls are expensive. That's a huge frustration, because we can achieve so much just for the cost of a phone call,\" said Miller.</p> <p>Eoto volunteer tutors complete a six-week, part-time training course before teaching. Htoo and Gana's teacher Naralle works for an insurance company by day and teaches the Karen group one evening per week. </p> <p>\"Their reading and writing is very good, so I'm going to start to focus more on conversation,\" she said. </p> <p>\"For me, it's about giving something back to the community, but I also get a lot of insight into their culture. I've travelled in south-east Asia and I hope to go and work in the camps my students come from.\"</p>",
  "<p>I was born and raised in hurricane country, on the Gulf Coast of Texas. Each hurricane leaves its own fingerprint on landscapes and lives, but some things remain the same. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/13/naturaldisasters.usa\">Hurricane Ike</a> is no different</p> <p>If you ever want to know what the end of the world might look like, hurricanes give you a pretty good window into human behaviour. Unlike the wildfires of California, tornadoes of Oklahoma, blizzards of Michigan or droughts of the southwest, Hurricanes are unique among natural disasters because they tell you that they are coming.</p> <p>The national media descends on coastal communities hoping to be perfectly positioned at the exact point of maximum devastation and calamity, anticipating the destruction and loss of human life as if it is some type of sporting event. Maybe it is for them.</p> <p>Television personalities, such as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200506/pappu\">Geraldo Rivera</a> of Fox News, stand precariously among the crashing waves that precede the storm's arrival, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywtQOyzjwQ\">describing what we can all clearly see</a> with out own eyes, without the dramatic voice-overs. For his efforts during Hurricane Ike, Geraldo was rewarded when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J52xbx2__OY\">video of him falling face first</a> into the surf off Galveston Island went viral on the internet hours before Ike made landfall. Geraldo and hurricanes is becoming <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTknW1btHaM&amp;feature=related\">annoying national tradition</a>.</p> <p>While the national media clamours for destruction on a massive scale, the truth is that hurricanes typically take their greatest toll after the storm has passed, when the glare of national media attention has faded away. One can only wish that instead of frolicking in the surf in the hours before Ike hit, the media had spent more time telling people that the waves crashing ashore were less of a danger than the generators, chainsaws and candles sitting in viewer's homes. These things aren't as sensational as storm surges and 100mph winds, but they are just as deadly.</p> <p>In Ike's aftermath, entire families are getting sick and dying in their sleep from the carbon monoxide poisoning caused by <a href=\"http://www.kten.com/Global/story.asp?S=9005672\">gas-powered generators</a>. As of Tuesday, more than 30 people had been <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6004564.html\">treated for carbon monoxide poisoning</a> in Houston. <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6006107.html\">Two Houston men died</a> when they ran their gas-powered generator in the kitchen. In Beaumont, an hour and a half east of Houston, 10 people were rushed to the hospital for carbon monoxide poisoning, seven adults and three young children. They too were <a href=\"http://www.kten.com/Global/story.asp?S=9005672\">running the generator inside the house</a>. That number will continue to grow. No matter how many times officials <a href=\"http://www.kplctv.com/Global/story.asp?S=9004307&amp;nav=0nqx\">tell people not to run generators</a> indoors, people continue to do so.</p> <p>Generators aren't the only post-hurricane killers. People are ding in house fires because of <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6006107.html\">unattended candles</a>. They are being seriously injured cutting down trees and cleaning up debris. The fact that someone owns a chainsaw in no way qualifies them to chop down or remove trees that can weigh thousands of pounds. Even when qualified, tree cutting is still dangerous. One of the first Ike fatalities was <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6008126.html\">10-year-old Joel Smith</a>. He was killed when a tree fell on him when his parents were cutting it down in preparation for the storm.</p> <p>Many people are killed in one fell swoop when the Gulf of Mexico surges ashore, but more people will die in the aftermath day by day when the methods they use to cope with the storm kills them instead.</p> <p>After every storm, local AM radio still is the absolute best source of information. We used to huddle around when we were children listening to what was going on in the world beyond out neighbourhood. Unlike most televisions, which require electricity, radios can function on battery power. In addition, most television anchors and reporters appear to be auditioning during hurricane coverage, hoping that thrusting about in hurricane-force winds might propel them to some bigger more prominent position. Like Geraldo or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx7-8Rv62LU\">this idiot from the Weather Channel</a> who was blown into shrubs while standing outside in hurricane force winds. I had to chuckle when I saw a dancing bear ruin a live shot while some reporter was doing their best dramatic voice over <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKwMiExUKXg\">describing the destruction of a fishing pier</a>.</p> <p>Local AM radio is the exact opposite. The focus is on getting information from residents who have been affected by the storm. The drama of radio isn't some fabricated television shot by a producer, but listening to ordinary citizens report how their lives have actually been impacted by the storm. Information about gas, lights, ice, flooding doesn't come from some cub reporter from out of town. It comes from the little old lady who calls in to say there's water filling her front yard. Internet streaming allows anyone to listen to local radio even when they've evacuated out of radio range. My parents have been listening to KLVI.com, which covers our hometown. Local AM radio is all hurricane coverage all the time. It will be for weeks.</p> <p><em>This is the first of a two-part article on the aftermath of Hurricane Ike in Texas. Part two will appear tomorrow.</em></p>",

Photograph: PR</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last Sunday, I had a hangover. Nothing unusual in that, you might say, particularly for someone with personal experience of more than one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/sep/17/drugsandalcohol.health\">nine types of heavy drinker</a>; I often have a hangover on a Sunday. Except, this time, I had taken deliberate precautions. I had, I thought, an <a href=\"http://www.alibidrink.com\">Alibi</a>.</p> <p>A new-ish \"active pretox drink\", Alibi's makers, Solution Sciences Ltd., are careful not to sell it, explicitly, as a hangover prophylactic. They make no extravagant claims for Alibi's ability to ward off nausea, headaches and self-loathing. Instead, it's billed, rather coyly, as having been, \"developed to prepare your body to receive and process toxins quickly and efficiently\".</p> <p>However, its target customer is obvious enough: 20 and 30-something professionals who still drink like students, but who don't have time to waste in recovery. As the Alibi website puts it: \"From the bar on a night out to the boardroom the morning after ... Alibi gets your body ready to be at your best.\"</p> <p>Personally, I'm unconvinced. I tested it out over a couple of weekends and, while these were hardly laboratory conditions, results were distinctly mixed.<br><br>First time out, I downed a can midway through two nights of heavy drinking and not a lot of sleep. Come Sunday evening, I must admit that I did feel rather perkier than I normally might. I actually had the energy to reach for the remote and turn <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapheap_Challenge\">Scrapheap Challenge</a> off. Remarkable stuff. But was that residual lift down to Alibi's 600% RDA dose of vitamin B12 or was it pot luck? Was it science or psychosomatic? Was it down to taking on <a href=\"http://www.alibidrink.com/ingredients.html\">100mg of succinic acid</a>, or because I'd been drinking in pubs which clean their pipes properly? Who knows.</p> <p>Certainly, the second time I tried it - prior to six pints and several large brandies - I felt resolutely bleugh all the next day. They may be selling Alibi in <a href=\"http://www.harveynichols.com/output/Page1.asp\">Harvey Nichols</a>, but, less glamorously, I didn't come round until I'd had a half-time pie at the football. Of course, some of Alibi's <a href=\"http://www.alibidrink.com/about.html\">herbal extracts</a>, like the 280mg of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2003/dec/28/shopping.foodanddrink\">milk thistle</a> in each can, may be more about protecting your body long-term, than making sure you feel zingy the next morning. But, really, what use is that? If I was some sort of health freak, I wouldn't be drinking in the first place.</p> <p>No. What I was looking for was a solid steel hangover shield; a guaranteed get-out clause; a miracle. And, whatever Alibi is, it isn't that. The only thing I can tell you with any certainty, is that it tastes quite nice, like lime Lucozade, but with a slight medicinal tang. </p> <p>But, then, what did I expect? \"No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover,\" concluded <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/331/7531/1515\">a 2005 paper published in the British Medical Journal</a>, which very much chimes with my own dedicated research. Over the years, I've tried everything to ward off the inevitable - lining my stomach with milk; boosting myself with Berocca; smoking / not smoking, taking paracetamol before staggering to bed - all to negligible effect. </p> <p>The only things that do genuinely seem to help are: walking a few miles home to burn off some of the alcohol, and drinking plenty of water through the day before. Even then, some hangovers just feel like fate. One night, you can drink 10 pints and wake up all sunny. On another, you can drink half a bottle of wine and feel like Bacchus has embedded an ice-pick in your eye.</p> <p>As regards the latter, it seems that everyone <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/food/features/hangover-remedies-put-to-the-test-08-08-28_p_1.html\">has a different favourite form of self-medication</a>. According to <a href=\"http://www.moderndrunkardmagazine.com/md_faq.htm\">Modern Drunkard magazine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.moderndrunkardmagazine.com/issues/08_05/0805_kingsley.htm\">Kingsley Amis</a>, who wrote three books on drinking, swore by a cure-all morning after mix of Bovril and vodka, known as a Polish Bison. The Scottish rely on Irn Bru of course, while hard partying New Orleans has developed its own hangover soup, <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/holidays/newyearsday/hangovercures\">Yaka Mein</a>. </p> <p>Personally, I swear by bananas; Alka-Seltzer; long walks; and in rare moments of dire emergency - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/07/foodanddrink13\">a seriously bad move though it is</a> - the hair of the dog. It's not big and it's certainly not clever, but sometimes another drink, a good Bloody Mary or a small light lager, really is the only way forward.</p> <p>But what about you? Do you have any failsafe harm reduction techniques? Or pre-session habits that make you feel better? And what about remedies for <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2187387/pagenum/all/\">hangovers themselves?</a></p>",
  "<p>If the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">economic crisis</a> does become this century's Great Depression, how will art be changed? That seems hard to answer without also considering politics. In the 1930s art was divided between Left and Right, as well as between modernist and realist. It mattered more where you stood than how you painted. Jackson Pollock, Arshile Gorky and other American socialists were influenced by realism and pictorialism and the mural tradition of revolutionary Mexico, but ended up finding their own voices as abstract artists. The realism of <a href=\"http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=Walker%20Evans&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi\">Walker Evans</a>'s photographs of rural poverty, John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, or in this country George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier makes us think of Depression-era culture as serious, truthful, shorn of illusions - and many might like it if we got more art of that kind now. But hang on. </p> <p> </p> <p>The Depression was also the era of Salvador Dali's kitsch surrealism and, more seriously, of fascism and its cultural excesses. The Nazis had their own answer to economic catastrophe. In Leni Riefenstahl's film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcFuHGHfYwE&amp;feature=related\">Triumph of the Will</a> formerly unemployed Germans march with the shovels they've been given to work on autobahn-building. With the Nazis' corporate solution came art like Riefenstahl's - irrational, fantastic, disturbingly powerful. </p> <p>Of course in the 1930s there was another alternative - the USSR. The Communist alternative has however been crushed by history, and is not coming back. Those on the Left who see opportunity here will soon be disabused. Instead, the terror of capitalism in crisis without the alternative of Marxism is that irrational alternatives will flourish. We are more likely to get a new Riefenstahl than a new Walker Evans.</p>",

But in the sense of the Congress today, they know that there are very, very hungry domestic markets that need that oil first,\" Palin said. \"So, I believe that what Congress is going to do, also, is not to allow the export bans to such a degree that it's Americans that get stuck to holding the bag without the energy source that is produced here, pumped here. It's got to flow into our domestic markets first.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But when it comes out of the mouth of the person who <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-nelson/mccain-thinks-palin-knows_b_125830.html\">knows more about energy than anyone in the United States</a>, I say you better listen pal. Molecule flagging is a very serious, insidious, hidden issue in America today. And not just in the realm of energy. Small-town librarians who permit books about gays on the shelves, for example; can't it fairly be said that their molecules have flagged beyond the point of redemption?</p> <p>Hilzoy spends <a href=\"http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/09/energy-expertis.html\">two paragraphs</a> trying to take Palin's statement seriously, and it fares no better under that generous light:</p> <blockquote> <p>But let's pretend this is a serious statement, and consider it seriously. Who do we presently export oil to? Well: in 2007, the two main recipients of our oil were Mexico and Canada, who between them received some 170,716,000 barrels of what the Energy Information Administration calls \"petroleum and products.\" That's nearly a third of our exports. But guess what? When you look at the analogous table of imports, who turns up in first and second place? Canada and Mexico again! They sold us 1,455,280,000 barrels between them in 2007, or about eight and a half times as much as we sold them. If you check crude oil alone, it turns out that all our exports in 2007 went to Canada, which was also our number one supplier, selling us nearly seventy times as much crude oil as we sold the Canadians.</p> <p>Do you think that they would keep on selling us all that oil if we unilaterally stopped selling oil to them? Maybe they would, and maybe they wouldn't. Do you think Sarah Palin knows the answer? I hope so. It would be pretty strange for the nation's foremost expert on energy to come out in favor of an embargo without knowing whether or not it would cost us nearly 1.3 billion barrels of \"petroleum and products\" a day year (oops), including about 19% of our total crude oil imports. Annoying our neighbors so much that they cut off our oil supplies would, I suppose, be one way of helping us achieve energy independence, but it doesn't seem like a particularly good idea.</p> </blockquote> <p>But of course Palin is America's leading energy authority.<br></p>",
  "<p>The crisis over contaminated milk in China widened today when tests showed that three of the country's leading dairy firms had also been affected.</p> <p>The growing scandal has been blamed for the deaths of four infants, while a further 6,200 babies have become ill.</p> <p>Initially the scare - caused by the presence of melamine, a chemical normally used in plastics - was thought to have been confined to powdered milk.</p> <p>However, today's test results showed that around 10% of liquid milk samples taken from the Mengniu Dairy Group Co and the Yili Industrial Group Co, China's two largest dairy producers, were found to contained melamine. </p> <p>Milk from the Shanghai-based Bright Dairy also showed contamination.</p> <p>The results of the tests were reported by China's general administration of quality supervision, inspection and quarantine. </p> <p>A statement on the organisation's website said it would \"strictly find out the reason for adding the melamine and severely punish those who are responsible\", adding that all batches of milk to have tested positive for the chemical were being recalled.</p> <p>Grocery chains reacted to the news by withdrawing all liquid milk made by Mengniu from their shelves. </p> <p>Stores in Hong Kong cleared their stores of the affected products. Yesterday, milk, yogurt, ice cream and other products made by the Yili Industrial Group Co were withdrawn.</p> <p>Meanwhile Starbucks said its 300 cafes in mainland China had withdrawn all milk supplied by Mengniu.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the Mengniu's chief executive officer, Niu Gensheng, vowed to create a clean dairy product market. He told a financial magazine he would resign if the scandal was not properly resolved. </p> <p>The contamination scare began with complaints over milk powder produced by the Sanlu Group Co, one of China's best-known and most respected brands.</p> <p>It quickly became a much larger issue when government tests found that one-fifth of companies producing baby milk powder had melamine in their products.</p> <p>Although most of the dairy products involved are only sold domestically, two of the companies exported their products to five other countries in Asia and Africa.</p> <p>Regulators for consumer product safety in the US, EU and China met to announce a joint initiative on consumer safety issues.</p> <p>\"The situation underscores the need for these kinds of conversations. We must have confidence that we can reach out to our Chinese and EU counterparts ... whenever we encounter problems,\" Nancy Nord, the acting chair of the US Consumer Product Safety commission, said.</p> <p>Thousands of worried parents and their children have filled hospitals in China since the scare began.</p> <p>Melamine, a toxic industrial chemical, can cause kidney stones and lead to kidney failure. </p> <p>Suppliers of some milk products are believe to have tried to cut costs by adding the chemical to watered-down milk.</p> <p>Around 1,300 babies, mostly newborns, remain in hospital because of the contamination, with more than 150 suffering from acute kidney failure.</p> <p>Police in the northern Chinese Hebei province, where Sanlu is based, have so far arrested 18 people in connection with the contamination crisis.</p>",
  "<p>I do not want an arranged marriage. I do not want to even get married. But I am Asian, female and second-generation British. I have a partner and we live together. And yes, he has met my father and all of my extended family. My father has met his parents. And they share a work ethic, an understanding of Britain, and of world events that means learning about each other's cultural background only enriches all our lives to a deeper level. You see, my partner and his family are not Asian; they are from the UK, and they are white.</p> <p>Last Saturday writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/13/family1\">Ziauddin Sardar</a> rolled out the familiar manifesto extolling the virtues of arranged marriages as a means of keeping community values alive. The piece revealed some deep prejudices that can't be left unchallenged.</p> <p>First, the tone is of teaching a lesson in social studies to a mysterious other: the \"you\" addressed is \"people in Britain\", specifically, white people, whose family life is in a \"state\". (First complaint; Asian people live in Britain, are part of British society and read the Saturday Guardian too.) The writer implies that non-Asian, non-arranged marriages end in divorce, and that in white culture, adolescents binge drink, form gangs and perpetrate violence. Not so, the writer tries to argue, in Asian culture which has extended families and arranged marriages to keep people moral. Again, sorry to state the obvious, but British Asian teenagers binge drink too. They get in fights and they belong to gangs, but they probably don't tell their parents</p> <p>They also don't tell if they snog each other or lose their virginity ignobly in the middle of the day in their mate's university room because their dad is picking them up from college before it gets dark. In fact, many Asian young people live a double life to an unhealthy extent, lying to the point of living in a state of denial, not because they don't honour their parents, but because honesty about who you are and what you are doing takes second place to traditional Asian society's perceptions of what is right and proper behaviour. It's a hypocrisy that hides everything from the odd bottle of WKD on a night out, right down to secret abortions. Asian extended families, for all their virtues, perpetrate this culture of silence to a minute degree, because the behaviour of each person in the structure represents the moral probity of the whole.</p> <p>So while you might get support from everyone when you do what they think is right, you risk losing a lot if you reject the standard. The divorce rate might indeed be lower in arranged marriages, but its not because they \"work\" as Sardar puts it, its also because people are brought up to believe they shouldn't divorce even if they are emotionally, intellectually and physically, unfulfilled within the union.</p> <p>The second problem with the piece was that the dirty history of arranged marriages was covered up. Traditionally women were bought and sold as commodities, to increase the wealth and mutual benefit of each family involved. From her father's house to her husband's parents' house, the younger and more able to bear (male) children, the better. </p> <p>Some things may be different now; rather than trying to gain loyalty by association, or new plot of land in exchange for a daughter, for the Asian diaspora, arranging marriage is motivated by fear. A deep fear that language, culture and traditions will die and family bonds will break. But this fear is essentially fear of the \"other\"; it is evident in many refugee or immigrant cultures worldwide. It is enshrined in the tenets of some religions that you cannot marry \"out\" without losing your identity. It's a way of keeping things \"pure\" and it's a lesson that stalks young British Asians from childhood.</p> <p>Because, as is well documented in many cultures, women are the traditional custodians of patriarchal ideals in families. Using powerful, ancient stories that contain implicit warnings, they protect and pass on concepts such as purity to their children, especially girls. So it's disingenuous to argue that because women are the \"practitioners\" of the ancient art of arranging marriages it is therefore not a misogynistic tradition. </p> <p>Is it too much to hope that bringing up young people to be aware of their culture and traditions but able to make choices without pressure from any group in society, might mean they keep the best of their heritage, enrich it with diverse influences, and jettison the rest? Sardar's research into \"<a href=\"http://www.foyles.co.uk/display.asp?K=9781862079311&amp;aub=Ziauddin%20Sardar&amp;m=28&amp;dc=37\">Balti Britain</a>\" seems to suggest this is thankfully and slowly beginning to happen. But the \"other\", in terms of race, religion or ethnicity (forget same-sex partners) is still, according to Sardar, far from welcome in the Asian family.</p> <p>It's a shame he holds this view, and that he, in keeping with his role as head of his family, takes it on himself to be the voice of one community to another. I was brought up to respect my parents, speak Hindi, make chapattis and be grateful for aloo gobi sandwiches in my school packed lunch. My favourite music includes Ravi Shankar and tunes from Bollywood movies. I've met a man who shares this taste in music, wants to learn Hindi; we hope to be able to afford to have my father and his parents live with us, or near us, one day if they want to, and will look after them in their old age. We don't know what the future will bring but we do know that it's up to us to make it work and our families will support us in this, and in whatever we decide.</p> <p>The models of modern arranged marriage and Asian extended families are not a cure for white western cultural \"ills\". To suggest they are is at best misguided, at worst dangerous, complacently ignoring as it does the problems inherent in the Asian system. Do we, if \"we\" as a community exist, need someone to speak for us, to you, whoever you are; you who are not \"us\"? Looked at that way, it feels like there's still a long way to go.</p>",

  "<p>Norrebro, the neighbourhood in Copenhagen where I grew up, has for years been plagued by criminal youth gangs whose members are increasingly drawn from the Turkish, Pakistani, and Palestinian communities. </p> <p>It wasn't always like this; indeed Norrebro used to be seen as an example of how integration in Denmark was working \u2013 but that's not the case any more. As competition for the lucrative drug trade has increased, there is a sense of fear and mistrust between the communities and integration is non-existent. </p> <p>To exacerbate matters, for weeks Copenhagen has witnessed an intensifying war between the notorious motorcycle group, Hells Angels, and the drug gangs. Bullets have flown and many residents are abandoning the troubled area. </p> <p>Compounding the drug turf wars is a nasty streak of racism. The Hells Angels are currently recruiting prospects to \"rid Denmark of the Muslim menace\". Meanwhile, their opponents are seeking new members to \"eliminate those who want to eliminate us\". </p> <p>A network of violent gangs is operating around town, directly targeting the \"fortresses\" where Hells Angels hang out. The Angels' <a href=\"http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/article569114.ece\"> response </a> is typically unrestrained: \"Hells Angels are a motorcycle club that bothers no one, but if someone steps on our toes we'll stamp back with a vengeance,\" they said on a website. </p> <p>Despite these claims, the Angels are no angels. For years they fought an armed war with another motorcycle gang, the Bandidos, vying for control of Copenhagen's criminal markets. Scores of dead later, the conflict cooled down. </p> <p>If the original motorcycle gangs consisted of misfits, this is even more true of their new enemies. Isolated from society, these kids' only claim to self-esteem is violence. Several well-meaning local groups and individuals have tried to reach out to these youngsters, but all attempts have failed and many of those who tried have had to move out of the neighbourhood, fearing for their personal safety.</p> <p>Copenhagen and Denmark has turned into a hotspot for racial tension. Immigration is the single most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/04/denmarklosestolerance\">populist political issue</a>. Affluent Denmark has dramatically failed when it comes to integration. With Europe's most stringent immigration laws, an insistence on monoculture and assimilation, the once-pragmatic Danes have increasingly isolated themselves. </p> <p>The famous Danish photographer, Jacob Holdt, who in the 1970s documented racism in the US and said in today's Politiken newspaper: \"Denmark is today more racist than America.\"</p> <p>Frightening indeed, and a largely self-created problem. The current centre-right government \u2013 supported by the nationalistic and right wing Danish Peoples party \u2013 has since 2001 marginalised and stereotyped immigrants. </p> <p>The troubles on the streets of Norrebro can be traced back to that approach. This is not to defend or excuse the community's violent response \u2013 parts of the area are now a total no-go area and even the Danish Broadcasting Corporation is staying away from certain trouble spots as journalists have been threatened with beatings if they film in the area.</p> <p>How did it come to this? Denmark has been through a decade of years of unprecedented economic growth. Our society is much fairer than the British with far fewer class divisions. As we say in Danish: \"Why didn't we fix the roof while the sun was shining?\"</p> <p>The answer, unfortunately, is that there was no will to do so. An unwelcoming host will usually find he has impolite guests. This is the case in Copenhagen right now and it is hard to see how things will change.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Good morning and welcome to what, surely, is a Brussels bureaucrat's wet dream: three days of sweet European Union harmony where, for a change, we stick one to Uncle Sam. But while Europe are justifiable favourites for the 37th Ryder Cup - they're unbeaten since 1999 and all their team is in the world's top 50- don't discount the impact of a Kentuckian crowd fuelled by moonshine and patriotic fervour. It could go down to the wire.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>While you're waiting for play to begin ...</strong> why not peruse our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/interactive/2008/sep/16/rydercup2008\">interactive guide of the Valhalla course</a>, read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/18/rydercup.golf1\">Mike Adamson's predictions for the foursomes</a>, or take in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf2\">Richard Williams' verdict on Nick Faldo and Paul Azinger</a>? Or, alternatively, you could try to beat the office record of 33 in Mini Putt 2 by clicking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/27/games.toys\">here</a> and scrolling down the page to the golf section of our Greatest Internet Sports Games.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Dawn at Valhalla ... </strong> and the European supporters are already singing 'There's only one Nick Faldo!' Not everyone is impressed with the European team captain, mind. \"Does anyone actually like Faldo?\" splutters Darren Ford. \"He's an odd choice for captain seeing as he's completely lacking in charm and grace, has an unwarranted arrogance to rival Johnny Borrell and has all the man management skills of Graeme Souness.\" He did win six majors, Darren. Borrell has written one half-decent song.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1.05pm BST</strong> There are lots of yee-haws and cheers as Phil Mickelson, Anthony Kim, Padraig Harrington and Robert Karlsson arrive on the first tee. It's already a feisty atmosphere and it's only 7.05am. God knows what it will be like come Sunday afternoon. Padraig steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1.06pm BST</strong> ... and hits a steady iron straight down the middle of the 448-yard par 4, first. But he's quickly outdone by Mickelson, who pulls out his one wood, snorts in the Valhalla air, and cracks a perfect drive 50 yards past Harrington. Cue loud chants of 'USA! USA!'</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1.10pm BST</strong> Superb approach from Karlsson at the first; his approach is within 10 feet.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1.11pm BST</strong> Mickelson's booming drive has put Kim just 110 yards from the hole. He steps up, wriggles his wrists and hits a shot that only <em>just</em> clears the bunker and lands about 15 feet from the flag.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1.13pm BST </strong> Mickelson for birdie. He spends a good 30 seconds standing over the ball before sending it a foot wide of the hole. It's conceded, which means Harrington has a putt to Europe one up ...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1.15pm BST</strong> ... which he does with the minimum of fuss. Harrington and Karlsson are one up after one.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1.18pm BST</strong> \"The Ryder Cup makes me proud to be a European,\" says David Michaels. \"Give me the Euro over the pound any day. Let's sign up for the single currency right now. Who is with me?\" Not my colleague Barry Glendenning, who claims he wants the Americans to win because of his dislike of Nick Faldo. Let's see if three days of 'USA! USA' changes his resolve ...</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1.21pm BST</strong> The second match Paul Casey &amp; Henrik Stenson v Justin Leonard &amp; Hunter Mahan gets underway. Casey hits a corker which finds the middle of the fairway; Leonard finds the light rough but should be OK.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1.24pm BST</strong> Both the US and Europe find the light rough with their drives on the 505-yard par-4 second. \"When did sporting success have anything to do with popularity?\" asks Andy Moore. \"British sport is littered with popular losers, Faldo's reputation seems to be based on a steadfast refusal to not be one of them. Also along with Faldo's six majors he is also the winner of the most points of any European in Ryder Cup history. I should imagine he knows a thing or two about winning it.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.27pm BST</strong> Stenson on fire! He's fired his approach on the first to within 12 feet.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.29pm BST</strong> Mickelson and Kim have the advantage on the second: Mickelson's approach goes to within 15 feet; Harrington is at least twice as far with his.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.31pm BST</strong> Europe could be about to go up in the second match too. The Americans are 25 foot away in three; the Europeans closer in two. \"There's been a disappointing lack of sarcastic commentary about the identikit wives of the American team this year,\" says Ben Mimmack. \"Have they started showing signs of individualism or has the joke worn thin I wonder?\" Give it time Ben.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.33pm BST</strong> Mahan misses his par putt, Casey rolls his birdie attempt to within six inches: it's enough for Casey and Stenson to go one up after one.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.35pm BST</strong> Both Kim and Stensson miss their birdie putts at the second. The Europeans make Mickelson putt out, which he does with the minimum of fuss. Harrington and Karlsson remain one up after two.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.38pm BST</strong> Europe's superb early start continues in the third match - Stewart Cink &amp; Chad Campbell v Justin Rose - as Campbell thumps his drive at the first into the deep stuff, while Rose finds the edge of the fairway.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.40pm BST</strong> Meanwhile to your emails, where Jim Butler wants to know if \"anyone has a link to a video of our Dear Leader Nick's speech yesterday? Since the Office is long finished, I could do with a good cringe-fest.\" Well?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.42pm BST</strong> Harrington's tee shot at 206-yard par 3 third is Reanimator II disgusting: it's in the deep stuff and, despite repeated efforts, isn't able to be hacked out. Eventually the Europeans concede, which means the first match is now all square.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.44pm BST</strong> Meanwhile Gary Naylor is unhappy. \"The role the wives play in the Ryder Cup appears to be predicated on the belief that the last forty years or so of cultural, social and political change never actually happened,\" he writes. \"I really hope that a gay golfer will make the team for 2010, so we can see a Ken amongst the Barbies.\" I'm pretty sure gay golfers have made previous Ryder Cup teams Gary: they're just not openly gay (and given golf's inherent conservatism can you blame them?)</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.46pm BST</strong> Poulter's approach to the first drifts to the left, leaving Rose a 20-footer to win the hole. He makes several practice putts, steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.47pm BST</strong> ... and sends it just wide. Cink makes his two-far par putt to leave the third match all square after one.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.49pm BST</strong> There's better news for Europe in the second match as Leonard and Mahan bogey the second to slip to two down. Meanwhile here's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv-VErBMFW0\">some video of Faldo yesterday</a>.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.52pm BST</strong> The fourth match - Kenny Perry &amp; Jim Furyk v Lee Westwood &amp; Sergio Garcia - gets underway. Westwood blitzes his drive down the fairway, Furyk gets on the smooth stuff too, eventually, after a short bound in the light rough.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>1.55pm BST</strong> This from the wires: apparently Paul Azinger attended a \"pep rally\" in downtown Louisville last night where he urged spectators to be their \"13th man\", telling them \"you can cheer when they (Europe) miss putts\". This could be a very raucous weekend indeed ...</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.57pm BST</strong> Shot of the day so far from Harrington, who sends his approach to the 375-yard par-four to within five feet. But immediately it's bettered by Mickelson, who flicks it to within four feet from the light rough.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.59pm BST</strong> Karlsson makes his birdie putt ... although it rattles around the cup before sinking and, somewhat surprisingly, tells Anthony Kim he does have to putt out. The first match remains all square after four.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>2.01pm BST</strong> There are boisterous chants of 'USA! USA!' as Leonard birdies the par-3, third to leave Stenson and Casey one up after three.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>2.03pm BST</strong> Meanwhile on the first, Westwood strolls in a 12-footer for birdie to move Europe one up after one in match four.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 2.05pm BST</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim A/S Harrington/Karlsson (after four)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Stenson/Casey 1 up</strong> (after three)<br>Cink/Campbell A/S Rose/Poulter (after one)<br>Perry/Furyk v <strong>Westwood/Garcia 1 up</strong> (after one)</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>2.07pm BST</strong> After some adventures on the second, Rose glides in a 10-footer for par which earns Europe a half.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2.09pm BST</strong> Casey and Stenson are in trouble on the par-3 third, but Stenson's par putt from the edge of the green means the Americans have to putt out from four feet to win the hole. Mahan steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.10pm BST</strong> ... and makes it to leave the second match all square after four.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.12pm BST</strong> Meanwhile a question from Mike Hatcher. \"Sean, how deep is the deep stuff? US Open style, or wet Carnoustie?\" It's pretty mild, Mike. \"I also have an argument to settle re: Faldo vs Monty,\" he adds. \"If you could only have one, who would you pick in your team (in their respective pomps)? I'd have Monty, because I think he'd be more inspiring for the rest of the team - despite him being almost as much of an arse as Faldo obviously is.\" Anyone?</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.15pm BST</strong> After a sensational tee shot by Rose at the par-3 third, Poulter taps in a three-foot putt to put Europe up in the third match.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.17pm BST</strong> But Westwood and Garcia miss the chance to go two-up at the second when Garcia's putt slips past the hole.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2.19pm BST</strong> \"I was wavering until Faldo's speech last night before finally deciding to hope the Americans win,\" says Niall Glynn. \"The following comments were too stupid to be offensive but still highlight that he is little more than a charmless cretin. On Padraig Harrington he said that: 'he had hit more golf in practice than potatoes planted in Ireland'. He then turned to Graham McDowell and asked him whether he was from 'Ireland or Northern Ireland.' Seriously Sean, what a dick.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.21pm BST</strong> Drama at the 500-yard, par-4 sixth! The Americans have the advantage on the green, with Harrington having a birdie putt of 40 feet and Mickelson less than half that. But Harrington makes his attempt, Mickelson lips out, and Europe are now one up in the first match.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 2.25pm BST</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim v <strong>Harrington/Karlsson (1 up) </strong> (after six)<br><strong>Leonard/Mahan (1 up)</strong> v Stenson/Casey (after five)<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Rose/Poulter 1 up</strong> after four<br>Perry/Furyk v <strong>Westwood/Garcia 1 up</strong> (after three)</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>2.26pm BST</strong> The loudest cheer of the day comes as local Kentucky boy Kenny Perry sinks a 50-footer for birdie at the 3rd. Garcia misses his putt from 15-feet and the final match is suddenly all square.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2.28pm BST</strong> An ice-cold par putt from Poulter keeps Europe 1 up in match three. \"So Azinger's encouraging the American spectators to be louder and more patriotic?\" asks Nick Parish. \"Good grief. Isn't that like encouraging Joey Barton to show a bit more of his aggressive side?\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>2.30pm BST</strong> Harrington finds the rough at the monster 601-yard par 5 seventh and Karlsson can only hack out. \"Re: Faldo v Monty. I'd go for Monty every time,\" says Jamie Kennedy. \"You never know he might actually lamp a spectator one of these days and you couldn't get a better stage than the Ryder Cup in the US to do that.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.34pm</strong> The Americans are also having some adventures on the seventh, but despite Kim's five-wood going into a high bank about 100 yards from the flag, Mickelson is able to send his approach to within 15 feet. They have the advantage here ...</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.37pm BST</strong> \"Why is anyone worried about whether Faldo is a bit obnoxious or not?\" asks Gary Naylor. \"I hate sport's slick public relations stuff, thanking the sponsors, following the spun script, executing the media training gameplan blah, blah, blah. I doubt that I'd select Faldo or Monty were I planning a dinner party, but that's not the point is it? The Ryder Cup is great because although the players like to win, they really hate to lose, which produces gladiatorial combat. There's room for nice guys in that scenario, but more room for the likes of Seve, memorably described by Alan Partridge <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-5KUaeMaw\">here</a>. Why can't a player be nice <em>and</em> competitive, Gary? Most of the British medallists I spoke to during the Olympics didn't seem to have a problem doing both ...</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.39pm BST</strong> A huge fist-pump from Justin Rose as he makes a 15-footer at the fourth to put Europe 2 up in the third match.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.42pm BST</strong> Superb golf from Europe: Garcia and Westwood have gone back up in the fourth match while Harrington has made an 18-footer for par to stay one up in match one.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 2.45pm</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim v <strong>Harrington/Karlsson (1 up</strong> (after seven)<br>Leonard/Mahan A/S Stenson/Casey (after six)<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Rose/Poulter 2 up</strong> after five<br>Perry/Furyk v <strong>Westwood/Garcia 1 up</strong> (after four)</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.48pm BST</strong> \"So who's playing well Sean?\" asks Mark Cruise. \"Harrington in the first game? Anyone being propped up by their partner?\" Harrington has missed a couple of fairways and greens but has putted like a dream; Garcia is Highland Toffee solid; Rose and Poulter are playing well as a team. For the Americans, Kenny Perry seems to be struggling - the huge putt on the third, apart - and so does Anthony Kim.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.51pm BST</strong> The Kentucky crowd are certainly taking Azinger's advice to heart: after Karlsson's putt at the eighth lips out, which brings the first match back to all square again, there are loud claps and whoops. Given some face paint and a few Tomahawks it could almost be the Battle of the Little Big Horn.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>2.54pm BST</strong> Meanwhile Padraig Harrington is being treated by the physio for a neck problem. \"Neck knacked, Paddy whacked,\" sighs my colleague Barry Glendenning.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>2.56pm BST</strong> Oh dear oh dear oh dear. First Paul Casey finds the water at the seventh - much to the delight of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/apr/04/golf.lawrencedonegan\">Americans</a>. And then so does his partner, Henrik Stenson.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>2.59pm BST</strong> Cink and Campbell have the chance to pull a shot back at the sixth but Cink slides an eight-footer for birdie past the hole. The Americans body language as they leave the hole is about as sunny as Bolton in February.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.04pm BST</strong> Anthony Kim, who is still struggling away, finds the bunker at 10 but Mickelson hits a marvellous recovery to five feet. \"Can any of your American readers answer the following question,\" asks Richard Decker. \"Sarah Palin: why?</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 3.10pm BST</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim A/S Harrington/Karlsson (after 10)<br><strong>Leonard/Mahan 2 up</strong> Stenson/Casey (after eight)<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Rose/Poulter 2 up</strong> (after six)<br>Perry/Furyk A/S Westwood/Garcia (after six)</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.13pm BST</strong> There's been a huge swing in the last five minutes: the Americans secured a par on the 10th following Mickelson's bunker chip, while Harrington missed an 18-inch tiddler to square the hole. Then Furyk made a huge birdie putt to put pressure on Garcia, who dabbed his 15-footer for par wide. So both sides lead in one match, while the other two are all square.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.15pm BST</strong> \"I think Richard Decker's question is wrong,\" says Benjamin Hendry. \"It should be 'Sarah Palin: How?'

Garcia, from six yards closer, sends his shot over the back. Advantage USA.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.23pm BST</strong> Meanwhile Gary Naylor is back. \"It's perfectly possible to be nice and successful, but there are reasons why this combination is relatively rare. High level success in sport demands dedication, self-denial, ruthlessness and a fierce will to win. They sit on top and eventually (for many) drown out all the qualities that one needs merely to enjoy sport: teamwork, generosity of spirit, respect for oneself and one's opponent. It seems perfectly logical to me that the higher up the sporting food chain one goes, the fewer nice guys and gals one might meet. Who do you want to enjoy a drink with and who do you want playing for your life of these pairs? Ronnie O'Sullivan and Jimmy White; Shane Warne and Ashley Giles; Nick Faldo and Jean van de Velde?\" </p> <p>Having met a few sports people in my time, Gary, I suspect that there is a closer relationship between money/high public attention (particularly at an early age) and nastiness, particularly when it comes to footballers.

After yet another poor tee shot from Karlsson, this time on the 215-yard par 3 14th, Harrington can't get a horrible-positioned chip to within 40 foot.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.16pm</strong> More genius from Mickelson. Kim's tee shot landed high on the bank above the green; Mickelson had to land his chip right on the fringe and allow the slope to lead it gently down to the hole. Somehow he did it: the US are within six feet, Europe more like 50.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.18pm</strong> \"Pandering to Paul Broughton's head-in-the-sand isolationist war cry to keep things ignorantly frothy; how exactly does a Spaniard [Miguel Angel Jimenez] end up ginger?\" asks Darren Ford.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.20pm</strong> Leonard misses a makeable putt to win the hole on 12, which would have put the US two up in the second match. Meanwhile Harrington makes a six-footer for bogey on the 14th.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>4.21pm</strong> Kim makes his par, to bring the US back to one shot in the opening match. It's <em>this</em> close right now: Europe are up by one shot in two matches, the US are up by one shot in the others.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.23pm</strong> Garcia slides a 15-footer for birdie past the hole; Perry has a putt from an almost identical position but it begins to wheeze a foot or so before the cup and eventually dribbles just wide. A let-off for the Europeans. \"Re: Ginger Spaniards. Darren Ford should know that the Celts came from Spain originally (remember Celta de Vigo?),\" says Rob Lewis.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>Latest scoreboard at 4.26pm BST</strong></p> <p>Mickelson/Kim v <strong>Harrington/Karlsson 1 up</strong> (after 14)<br><strong>Leonard/Mahan 1 up</strong> Stenson/Casey (after 13)<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Rose/Poulter 1 up</strong> (after 11)<br><strong>Perry/Furyk 1 up</strong> v Westwood/Garcia (after 10)</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>4.28pm BST</strong> \"Paul Broughton might be bored to tears with what Guardian readers have got to say about the US election but I'm bored to tears with Naylor and his prattling. Are there no other contributions worth posting?\" asks James Calder. Reader, the floor is yours.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>4.29pm BST</strong> The Americans are on the charge! Campbell and Cink make par at the 12th from 15 feet, which will leave Rose with a four-footer for a half.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>4.32pm BST</strong> Rose makes his par to keep Europe one up after 12 in the third match. Meanwhile Leonard and Mahan are now two up after 14 in their match against Casey and Stenson.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>4.35pm BST</strong> Westwood hits a stunning approach to the par-four 11th but Furyk is equal to it. It'll be a putting contest. \"Who's Faldo going to drop for the fourballs Sean?\" asks Mike Hatcher. \"Sounds like Karlsson is wilting (maybe the erratic Stenson is a better bet in fourballs anyway).\" Karlsson, Casey and Stenson are all candidates, Mike.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>4.37pm BST</strong> More woe for Europe! First Rose hits a straightforward approach at 13 into the water; then Kenny Perry makes a 20-footer for birdie on 11.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>4.39pm</strong> Garcia misses his birdie putt at 11 and so Perry and Furyk are now two up in the final match. Cue loud chants of USA! USA! Speaking of which, this from Tony Scott. \"I have nothing against the Yanks, but that chanting of 'U-S-A, U-S-A' every time one of the American players so much as farts does get a bit tiresome sometimes. Much like the old gem 'Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oi, Oi, Oi'.

Coming off the 12th, the Europeans were three up; now Harrington has a 20-foot putt on the 16th to square the hole. He steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>4.46pm BST</strong> ... and nails it! Superb from Harrington. Absolutely superb. That's his third long-distance save this match and it keeps the first match level.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>4.49pm BST</strong> \"Not sure if this has been given the courage it deserves, but Hunter S Thompson is, after Mohammad Ali, Lousiville's most famous son,\" points out John in Belfast. \"And even though he shot himself in the face a few years ago, it would be safe to assume what he thought of the Presidential election and Sarah Palin \u2013 good on hunting and random gunnery \u2013 bad on the future of the Presidency.

That's why we log on.\"</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>4.51pm BST</strong> Another superb drive from Mickelson at the 477-yard par-four 17th, while Harrington has pulled his drive far left. No one knows it is, which isn't a positive sign.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>4.53pm BST</strong> The American charge continues! Poulter is unable to make a 60-footer for par and Europe are now one down in the third match. Looking at the scores, Europe are down in three matches and all-square (but in trouble) in the other. They could be 4-0 down at the end of the foursomes if they're not careful.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>4.55pm BST</strong> At last some joy for Europe as Garcia rolls in a 20-footer and Perry, from 15 feet, misses. The Americans are now just one up in the final match.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>4.58pm BST</strong> Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan make their par at the 16th to win 3 &amp; 2 and <strong>put America ahead by 1-0</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>5.01pm BST</strong> Harrington and Karlsson somehow par the 17th; Harrington hit a lovely bunker shot to within three feet and Karlsson <em>just</em> made the putt. Meanwhile this from one of our American readers. \"I'm glad our patriotism upsets you,\" says Seanc245. \"Suck it you Limey [very bad word]stick.\" Good day to you too.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>5.03pm BST</strong> Have a spare minute?

He rolls his first one close and the Americans concede.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>5.09pm</strong> Drama at the par-five 18th as both Kim and Karlsson find the bunker with their drives. Harrington thins Europe's second barely 120 yards, while Mickelson stuffs his approach into a greenside bunker.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>5.11pm</strong> \"I hope Faldo has the good sense to put McDowell out with Harrington this afternoon,\" says Cathal O'Flaherty. \"Karlsson is a corpse at this stage, hope he can finally get it together for the final hole!\" Speaking of which, Karlsson has a 92-yard approach to the flag. He's got a sand wedge in his hand ...</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>5.12pm</strong> ... and sends the approach to 15 feet. What can Kim do from the bunker?</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>5.13pm</strong> Kim fluffs it! His ball climbs out of the bunker and falls back into the rough. Now it's Mickelson's turn ...</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>5.14pm</strong> ... he lands five foot from the hole. Harrington will have one putt to win the match and at least two to tie. He's mulling over it now.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>5.15pm BST</strong> It's on it's way ... it's looking good ... but his putt slips to the left and slides a foot past. Anthony Kim has a five-footer to tie the match.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>5.17pm BST</strong> What balls! Kim makes his putt to ensure the opening match finishes all square.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>5.19pm</strong> Meanwhile Garcia has had a shocker on the 15th: he fired an easy approach into the drink and Europe ended with a six. They're now two down in the final match.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>5.20pm</strong> \"As an avid golfer raised in Kentucky, I'd like to categorically state that we're not all wackjob patriots,\" insists David Smith. \"I've been supporting (and wagering on) the Europeans since Kiawa Island and I have no intention of voting for the Palin-McCain.

Poulter has a tough approach - but overclubs and sends it 40 yards past the hole.

Now it's Campbell's turn ...</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>5.42pm BST</strong> ... and he hits the second-best shot of the day (only behind Mickelson's wedge on 14) to send the ball within 12 feet. Poulter and Rose have it all to do now.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>5.44pm BST</strong> \"Are you doing your minute by minute from Louisville, Sean?\" asks Sam Gracie. I wish Sam.

The Europeans are just inside the Americans, but they've taken a shot more.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>5.50pm BST</strong> Cink steps up to win the 3rd match for the United States. He has two putts here from 15 feet, but he's just knocked it four feet past.
