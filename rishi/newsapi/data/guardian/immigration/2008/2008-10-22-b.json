  "<p>Once it was the Kremlin that came begging to people like George Osborne for cash. In the old cold war, it secretly sold off the Soviet Union's gold reserves to pay for desperately needed grain imports. Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin sought bail-out after bail-out from the west, strongly backed by Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Now it is the other way round: Russia sits on a vast pile of cash, and we are selling principles and self-respect.</p> <p>Even before the financial crisis, London was the global leader in the respectability business: offering rich Russians the chance to turn their ill-gotten billions into prestige. Whether you wanted an entree to high society or to popular culture, British go-betweens and highly paid PR barons were willing to provide it. Buy a football team, sponsor a charity, or make a hefty donation to a posh boarding school - and you suddenly gain the right upmarket cachet. In exchange for what are to them trivial amounts of cash, the numerous oligarchs bought priceless respectability and safety. As fugitives from Russia found, Britain is a safe place - police and bodyguards work smoothly together; Russian extradition warrants count for little.</p> <p>In retrospect, that respectability was sold rather cheaply. With the war in Chechnya and imposition of state control on Russia's once pluralist media still in full swing, the British establishment decided that Russia under Vladimir Putin was a place to do business. The Russian tycoons - some of them ex-gangsters or ex-KGB - were seen as at worst a bit roguish. Tony Blair went for nights at the opera with his \"friend\" Mr Putin, the undertaker of Russia's political freedom. Britain's elite - the Rothschilds and Murdochs, even minor members of the House of Windsor - hobnobbed lavishly and sometimes lucratively with the \"new Russians\". </p> <p>Those who found their eyebrows rising or their stomachs heaving were told not to be so fuddy-duddy. Surely we should be glad that Russia was now roughly on the right track: rough capitalist diamonds are better than communist coals. Those who refused to play along soon got discreet warnings about the litigiousness of London's new elite.</p> <p>The banks, accountants and law firms joined the rush to the trough. Instead of upholding the principles - however shaky - on which our financial system is based, they have entered into the fray of Russian business, and connived in its attempts to subvert and evade those principles. Companies that are little more than criminal conspiracies, stealing billions of dollars from the Russian people for the benefit of unnamed shareholders, have their accounts signed off by our finest auditors. Top lawyers help them to conceal their identities and bombproof their business models. Bankers handle the cash and manage the dense web of offshore companies that conceal a trail pointing tantalisingly back to the Kremlin.</p> <p>In the shadows of Whitehall, officials are aghast at the way in which Russian money is buying friends and influence in our politics, public administration, independent regulatory bodies and businesses - particularly energy. All three parties have parliamentarians who are loyal members of the Kremlin chorus. British Tories, for instance, supported an attempt to make the former KGB man Mikhail Margelov president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe. </p> <p>But the Lib Dems, and particularly Labour, have little to be proud of either, as the fracas over Oleg Deripaska shows. It is not just the unsolicited non-donation to the Conservative party that is so shocking. It is that anybody claiming respectability in British public life thought it appropriate to have even social dealings with oligarchs like Mr Deripaska - who rose to power and riches first in the aluminium business in the 1990s, which witnessed some terrifying violence, and then at the court of Mr Putin.</p> <p>But even so, it cannot have escaped the notice of Peter Mandelson or George Osborne that Mr Deripaska is a man unable to enter the United States. A private briefing from the FBI - easily arranged in London - would have revealed that American officials are unhappy with some of Mr Deripaska's business associates.</p> <p>Mr Deripaska's defenders point out that he has never faced any criminal charges and blame his visa difficulties on unsubstantiated allegations from rivals. Moreover, Mr Deripaska has himself denied any wrongdoing in this and other controversies. </p> <p>A brief chat to informed British officials should have made it abundantly clear to Messrs Osborne and Rothschild, as well as Lord Mandelson, that dealings with Mr Deripaska should be limited, formal and cautious.</p> <p>The British governing class has not just mislaid its moral antenna. It has also forgotten that Russia is a national security threat: a point underlined repeatedly and publicly by MI5. Nato is now making contingency plans to defend its members from Russian attack for the first time since the end of the old cold war. Yet on the home front, we seem to have surrendered without a fight.</p> <p>\u2022 Edward Lucas is the author of The New Cold War: How the Kremlin Menaces Russia and the West <br><a href=\"http://edwardlucas.blogspot.com\">edwardlucas.blogspot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Phil Woolas is absolutely correct to say that the real failure on immigration is the government's record on clearing the backlog of asylum cases (We have lost people's trust on immigration, minister admits, October 21). It is extremely difficult for people to get into this country legally to work, or as a spouse or dependent. When people talk of an influx, what they are really referring to are illegal immigrants and those seeking asylum. It costs around \u00a340,000 a year to keep an adult in detention. It is in everyone's interests, including the applicant, to remove as soon as possible. Making the administration more efficient is the key. Again the minister is right, if the UK Borders Agency needs more money, people or other resources to speed up processing and removals, it must be provided with that. Introducing a cap on legal immigrants or other changes in legislation is unnecessary and will have no real impact.<br><strong>Keith Vaz MP</strong><br>Chairman, home affairs select committee</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Thursday October 23 2008. Mr Vaz meant to say it costs around \u00a340,000 a year to keep an adult in detention, not \u00a340,000 a day. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Don't worry. You can be happy. All you have to do, according to government thinktank Foresight, is follow its five-a-day programme of social and personal activities, and mental health and wellbeing shall be yours. Just as you should aim for a quintet of fruit and vegetables daily, you should now be aiming every day to connect with others, take some exercise, learn something new, take notice of your surroundings and get involved with your neighbours and local community. Manage all this and you will emerge - or so the theory goes - with a psyche as sleek and healthy as your bowels.</p> <p>My own theory is that nothing is more likely to add to the sum of human misery than excessive interaction with others, enforced exercise and a daily stare round the bleak and desolate environs in which most of us live, but perhaps that just goes to show that I need to sign up to the government plan and sluice my psyche free of the cynicism, antipathy and scepticism currently gunging up its works. So for one day only, I gave it a shot:</p> <h2>1. Connecting with friends, family, colleagues and neighbours<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338908562\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/22/mangan460.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Mangan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucy Mangan chatting with Shirley Barry, a member of her local community.

I work from home, so have no colleagues immediately to hand. My sister lives in Bristol and hates me. I've been trying to connect with my father for 34 years and he's still not interested, while if I become any more closely connected to my mother there is every chance that we will become one indivisible being, to - I assure you - absolutely no one's mental benefit. </p> <p>I ring round my friends but they are all very thoughtlessly in full-time employment and quite firmly resistant to the idea of interrupting their working lives to improve mine. </p> <p>This is the trouble with Pollyanna-style advice, of course. It generally presupposes a level of disposable income and leisure time that most people find laughable. Still, God and thinktanks love a tryer, so I head out to see if I can find some neighbours.</p> <p>I find 72-year-old Shirley Barry sitting on a bench in the sun, reading a book and minding her own business. Odd as it feels, I approach her. Is she willing to chat to, if not strictly a neighbour, a fellow local inhabitant of Beckenham? She is. \"I wasn't expecting an encounter,\" she says. \"I've lived here for 35 years and the Beckenhamians don't normally speak unless introduced.\" I'm from Catford, originally, I explain. She moved here from Hampstead and we are soon deep in conversation about the strange north-south London divide. \"I think it's because they used to keep all the unpleasant industries below the river,\" she muses. \"Gluemaking, bonemashing - the great stinks. I think it's lingered in the consciousness. But,\" she grins, \"I'm Welsh. We'll talk to everyone in all directions.\"</p> <p>Talking to Shirley doesn't just make me feel good. She makes me feel there is hope for humanity. I might start disturbing people on benches on a regular basis. Score one to Foresight.</p> <h2>2. Learn something new </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338908978\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/10/23/Mangan3.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Mangan happy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Learning to spatchcock a chicken.

Most of human unhappiness occurs during the school years when you are forced to learn new skills, facts and subjects all day with only occasional success. </p> <p>I could try, I suppose, at last to discover how to work out the area under a graph, if not precisely why, but Foresight suggests mending a bike, learning a musical instrument or trying new recipes. I have a bike but it is in full working order and it seems counterproductive to break it on purpose. I check the house for forgotten grand pianos and abandoned oboes, but find none. Cooking it is.</p> <p>Don't judge me, but I've always wanted to spatchcock a chicken. I print what seem like very clear instructions off the internet, but soon have to enlist the help of a husband.</p> <p>\"'Place chicken on a flat surface breast-side down.' Is the breast the top bit?\"</p> <p>\"Do you mean, when it's running about or when it's packed in its thingy?\" he says.</p> <p>\"When it's how you buy it from the supermarket.\"</p> <p>\"Because when it's running about, its breast is at the front.\"</p> <p>\"Yes. I understand that. Most breasts are at the front. It's almost the definition of the word. But is a supermarket chicken upside-down or back-to-front or what?\"</p> <p>\"Pull all its legs out from the body and we'll see how it must have walked when it was alive. Before it became this poor, plucked, pallid affront to humanity.\"</p> <p>\"OK. I still don't get it. Go and look on the internet.\"</p> <p>\"There's a video on YouTube. You're doing it all wrong. Turn it the other way. Cut down its backbone. No, its backbone. From its neck - no, its neck - to its bum.\"</p> <p>\"Now what?\"</p> <p>\"Now turn it over. And flatten it out.\"</p> <p>I have learned something new. I feel good. But bad for the chicken.</p> <h2>3. Be active</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338909136\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/10/23/Mangan2.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Mangan happy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing tennis with her mother.

I loathe exercise more than I can possibly say, so the sheer pleasure I get from our game takes me entirely by surprise. Exercising outdoors is an entirely different experience from running on the treadmill at the gym or flinging yourself about in a fuggy hall as an aerobicised automaton shouts incomprehensible instructions. The air! The space! The freedom! I cannot lie. It really is uplifting. And it has the further inestimable benefit of allowing me to smash a ball at my mother's head and pretend it was an accident. Truly, a giant step to happiness.</p> <h2>4. Take notice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338909082\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2008/10/23/Mangan1.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Mangan happy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kicking leaves in the park. Photograph: Teri Pengilley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"What is this life if, full of care,/We have no time to stand and stare?\" William Henry Davies, writer of these famous lines, was a one-legged vagabond, so if he could stand, stare and find beauty in the world, it behoves us all to have a go. </p> <p>Foresight recommends noting the beauty of the quotidian as well as the exotic and savouring the present, so on the way to the tennis courts in the local park, I try to discern the artless beauty in the skipful of rubbish outside an abandoned shop, the bell-like clarity of the children's voices in the school playground (which survives, by the way, even when they are shouting \"Throw the ball, dickhead!\" at a tiny, hapless figure clearly destined for a lifetime of panic attacks and bad life choices) and, in keeping with seasonal tradition, kick a pile of bronzed leaves in the park. A host of ageing dog turds underneath adhere firmly to my foot for the rest of the way. </p> <p>In the park, things become easier. Even in the middle of the urban sprawl, even in the middle of this unspeakably rotten modern age, find a few trees together with a stretch of grass and suddenly, despite all mankind's best efforts, you have beauty. And, just as we are about to leave, we see a flock of the parakeets that have inexplicably established themselves over the last few years in this corner of said urban sprawl settle in the largest oak tree - the quotidian and exotic in one charming prospect. </p> <p>And because I am savouring the present, I do not think about how they are driving out native species and how soon we will have to begin a serious programme of culling the lime-green interlopers. Nor do I dwell on the fact that this portion of Foresight's advice seems to amount to \"Be happy - stop thinking.\" They would be very proud of me, and my shit-covered shoes.</p> <h2>5. Helping friends and strangers</h2> <p>I can't find any strangers to help. The only ones I see are walking musclebound dogs that they are clearly itching to set on people. I go back to see if Shirley needs her shopping carried or something, but she is gone. I hit the phone again.</p> <p>Eventually, I get through to a friend who is in need of comfort. She is sitting in a Herfortshire A&amp;E with her toddler son who greeted the new dawn by climbing out of his cot and bouncing off the radiator below. \"He looked like he's been stabbed in the head,\" she wails. \"There was blood everywhere!\"</p> <p>\"But head wounds always bleed a lot, don't they?\" I say. \"Unless you can see brain, he'll probably be all right. And there are all sorts of carpet cleaners available nowadays. The room will be as good as new if you get scrubbing as soon as you're home.\" It feels good to help.</p> <p>So how do I feel at the end of the day? I feel better. If I - and almost more importantly, all my friends and family - could find the time and inclination to do it all every day I'm sure I would feel better still. But it remains for all but a fortunate few - whom I suspect are quite happy enough already - essentially unworkable advice. You might as well instruct the nation to live in the 1950s: surely the last time there was any hope of living this way en masse. As long as you were north of the river, of course.</p>",
  "<p>Growing inequality in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/america\">US</a> cities could lead to widespread social unrest and increased mortality, says a new <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations\">United Nations</a> report on the urban environment. </p> <p>In a survey of 120 major cities, New York was found to be the ninth most unequal in the world and Atlanta, New Orleans, Washington, and Miami had similar inequality levels to those of Nairobi, Kenya Abidjan and Ivory Coast. Many were above an internationally recognised acceptable \"alert\" line used to warn governments. </p> <p>\"High levels of inequality can lead to negative social, economic and political consequences that have a destabilising effect on societies,\" said the report. \"[They] create social and political fractures that can develop into social unrest and insecurity.\"</p> <p>According to the annual State of the World's cities report from UN-Habitat, race is one of the most important factors determining levels of inequality in the US and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/canada\">Canada</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338897074\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/22/MEGACITIES_2310.gif\" alt=\"megacities\" width=\"461\" height=\"502\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>\"In western New York state nearly 40% of the black, Hispanic and mixed-race households earned less than $15,000 compared with 15% of white households. The life expectancy of African-Americans in the US is about the same as that of people living in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China</a> and some states of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/india\">India</a>, despite the fact that the US is far richer than the other two countries,\" it said.</p> <p>Disparities of wealth were measured on the \"Gini co-efficient\", an internationally recognised measure usually only applied to the wealth of countries. The higher the level, the more wealth is concentrated in the hands of fewer people. </p> <p>\"It is clear that social tension comes from inequality. The trickle down theory [that wealth starts with the rich] has not delivered. Inequality is not good for anybody,\" said Anna Tibaijuka, head of UN-Habitat, in London yesterday. </p> <p>The report found that India was becoming more unequal as a direct result of economic liberalisation and globalisation, and that the most unequal cities were in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/southafrica\">South Africa</a> and Namibia and Latin America. \"The cumulative effect of unequal distribution [of wealth] has been a deep and lasting division between rich and poor. Trade liberalisation did not bring about the expected benefits.\"</p> <p>The report suggested that Beijing was now the most egalitarian city in the world, just ahead of cities such as Jakarta in Indonesia and Dire Dawa in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ethiopia\">Ethiopia</a>. </p> <p>In Europe, which was generally more egalitarian than other continents, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Slovenia were classed as the most equal countries with Greece, the UK and Spain among the least. \"Disparities are particularly significant in the cities of eastern Europe, larger Spanish cities and in the north of England,\" it said. </p> <p>It documents the seemingly unstoppable move of people away from rural to urban areas. This year it is believed that the number of people living in urban areas exceeded those in the countryside for the first time ever, but the report says there is no sign of the trend slowing. </p> <p>\"The dramatic transition between rural and urban communities is not over. Urbanisation levels will rise dramatically in the next 40 years to reach 70% by 2050,\" it predicts.</p> <p>The most dramatic urbanisation has been taking place in China, with many millions of people moving from the countryside to cities. The report says 49 new cities have been built in the past 18 years. The rapid transition to an urban society has brought great wealth but also many negative results. </p> <p>\"China has attained some of the deepest disparities in the world with urban incomes three times those in rural areas. Inequalities are growing, with disproportionate rewards for the most skilled workers ... and serious problems for the unemployed and informal workers.\"</p> <p>Urban growth rates are highest in the developing world, which absorbs an average 5 million new urban residents a month and is responsible for 95% of world urban growth. The report predicts that Asian cities will grow the most in the next 40 years and could have 63% of the world urban population by 2050.</p> <p>Tokyo is expected to remain the world's largest mega city, with 36.4m people by 2025. But Mexico City, New York, and Sao Paulo could give way in the league table to Mumbai, Delhi and Dhaka. Kinshasa and Lagos are the two African cities expected to grow the most, with each adding more than 6 million people by 2025.</p> <p>Rather than countryside to city movement, which has marked rapid population growth in the last 40 years, the UN expects more people to move from city to city. </p> <p>Capital cities in particular are attracting much more of countries' investments and are growing fast. Some are becoming home to nearly half a country's population. </p> <p>But the report also identified what it believes is the emergence of a new urban trend, with many cities now shrinking in size. The populations of 46 countries, including Germany, Italy, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/japan\">Japan</a> and most former soviet states, are expected to be smaller in 2050 than they are now, and in the past 30 years, says the report, more cities in the developed world have shrunk than grown.</p> <p>It found that 49 cities in the UK, including Liverpool and other old industrial centres in the north of England, and 100 in Russia reduced in size between 1990 and 2000, mainly because of unemployment. In the US 39 cities are smaller now than they were 10 years ago. </p> <p>The reasons for the decline of cities was mostly economic, but the report says that the environment is now an important factor. </p> <p>Air quality and pollution from mines, power plants and oil exploration have been responsible for population losses in India, Mexico and Africa, it says. \"Cities tend to struggle most with health-threatening environmental issues, such as the lack of safe water, sanitation and waste.\"</p>",
  "<p>From the mid-1930s, the arrival in Britain of \u00e9migr\u00e9 architects fleeing Europe was to have a profound and lasting effect on the course of architecture and design. Some, such as Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger and Peter Moro, arrived fully trained. Others, such as Stefan Buz\u00e1s, who has died aged 93, belonged to a later generation who were trained here but demonstrated the value of a good, central European education. His solid grounding in cultural values, combined with a modernist aesthetic, produced highly original buildings that brought sophistication and elegance to functional forms, and in doing so helped to raise design standards across the UK.</p> <p>Stefan was born in Tapolca, Hungary. On his mother's side, the family were wine producers from the Lake Balaton area. His father, a lawyer and idealistic Jewish socialist, was involved in the 100-day communist government in Budapest in 1919 and, when the Horthy counter-putsch routed the communists, the Buz\u00e1s family were forced to flee to Vienna, where Stefan was educated. He studied at the Technische Hochschule faculty of architecture, perhaps influenced by his uncle, Mano Lessner, a talented architect. However, in the spring of 1938, as the political situation deteriorated, Stefan was sent to Britain. He never saw his parents again.</p> <p>He lived briefly at Lawn Road flats, Hampstead, north London, a famous example of early modernist architecture and a haven for many refugee intellectuals, and before long he entered the Architectural Association school, where he formed lasting friendships with Oliver Cox and Leonard Manasseh. Another early friendship was with Michael Ventris, who famously deciphered the Linear B script.</p> <p>He graduated in 1940, and soon after began what was to become a long and happy association teaching at the architecture department of Kingston School of Art, where he met, and subsequently worked with, Eric Brown on several interiors and exhibition stands. </p> <p>In 1942 Stefan married the opera singer Joan Mills, with whom he had two daughters. In 1948, with a group of contemporaries, including Fello Atkinson and Dick Maitland from the Architectural Association, he set up James Cubitt &amp; Partners. Among the practice's early works were two projects designed by Stefan which, in the grey days of the 1950s, made an impact out of all proportion to their size: the South African tourist office and Qantas Airways next door, both in Piccadilly. Their sophistication and elegance set a standard of design against which other work in this field would be judged. In an article by Atkinson for the Architectural Review entitled The Disappearing Shopfront, these were the key images, and a prescient indication of how the appearance of our high streets would be changing.</p> <p>In 1951 Stefan designed and built a pair of small houses on adjoining plots at Ham Common, Surrey, one for his family. These were widely considered to be exemplars of the purest modern domestic architecture. Although now altered, they were on the visiting list of the 20th Century Society. For the Festival of Britain in 1951, he designed a section on earth sciences in the Dome of Discovery, an oasis of order and clarity in the confusion of that interior. This was followed in 1952 by the design of the Weather Window for the Time Life building in Bond Street. Beautifully detailed, with graphically presented electronic forecasting, it neatly reflected the English obsession with that subject.</p> <p>As the practice grew, it produced a string of fine buildings, including many schools for Hertfordshire under the direction of CH Aslin, the county architect. As the Cubitt partnership expanded, particularly in Africa, with offices opening in Accra and Lagos as well as Singapore, its buildings, especially those designed by Stefan, encapsulated the best functional design aspects of the modern movement and helped establish the practice's reputation. Tropical architecture at that time was flowering, with lightweight structures, gridded facades with louvred screens and balconies added to the new vocabulary, producing an elegant and functionally efficient form.</p> <p>Working in these parts of the world had its drawbacks. Expensive offices had to be set up and the fees from foreign governments and their administrators were often delayed interminably. This resulted in severe strains on the practice which started to affect the partners, who began to work in some degree of isolation. In 1955 Stefan took a year's sabbatical in the US as visiting professor in the architecture department of the University of North Carolina, where he met and formed a close friendship with the architect/engineer Eduardo Catalano. </p> <p>Back in England, he resumed working for the Cubitt partnership and in 1965, the year he left the practice, it won a major commission for the Cummins engine factory in Darlington, County Durham, designed in association with Eero Saarinen. Three years prior to this he designed the interior of the new Manchester airport. This was followed by interiors for the Standard Bank premises in Northumberland Avenue, London, and that year he and I were included in a group of four British architects, each commissioned to design a room-setting for a typical modern house at the British Exhibition in Stockholm. The pair of us opened a joint office in 1965.</p> <p>We collaborated on various projects before he retired in 1992, including interior designs for the new London offices of the merchant bankers Schroder Wagg, and then Lazards, and a series of interiors for the QE2 liner. Latterly he designed treasuries at Chichester and Norwich cathedrals, which will remain as a memorial to a highly original and sensitive architect. </p> <p>Never personally ambitious, Stefan was, when occasion demanded, decisive and outspoken. His natural fluency in languages and a gift for friendship made him a much loved companion, here and abroad. He had a strong affinity for Italy, aided by his admiration for the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa, with whom he shared a love for Sir John Soane's Museum, for which he wrote a guide book. A lifelong socialist, he detested the Thatcherite credo and the destruction it wrought on so many of the qualities he admired most in his adopted country. He became my father-in-law when his daughter Kate and I were married in 1966.</p> <p>He was a fellow of the Society of Industrial Artists and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1961.</p> <p>His marriage ended in divorce, and he is survived by his daughters.</p> <p>\u2022 Stefan Buz\u00e1s, architect and teacher, born January 16 1915; died October 2 2008</p>",
  "<p>Navel-gazing commentators in American journalism schools love to lament the dumbing-down of US political culture, but recently they've had no cause for complaint: the focus of debate has been the very nature of reality itself. At a campaign stop last week, Sarah Palin congratulated her audience for living in \"the real America\", and spoke of her love for \"the pro-American areas\" of America, a truly mindbending concept that may cause injury if you reflect on it for too long. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as John McCain watches the once solidly Republican state of Virginia slip out of his grasp, the latest campaign talking-point is that northern Virginia - the Washington suburbs where the Democratic vote is strongest - isn't \"real Virginia\" at all. Naturally, such distinctions enrage liberals, who resent the idea that not voting Republican equals a lack of patriotism. But the McCain/Palin definition of \"reality\" caught up with a prominent Republican too this week when Nancy Pfotenhauer, a senior McCain adviser, told a TV interviewer that she herself, Pfotenhauer, lived in a part of Virginia that she didn't consider to be real, whereupon she immediately vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving only an empty studio chair and the faint aroma of absurdity.</p> <p>Perhaps she's gone to \"the celebrity land\", another mystical world invoked by Palin this week. \"We were on the bus today, we were making a list of who are some celebrity singers who could come out and help us, and gosh, for the life of us, the pickins were slim there!\" the Alaska governor told a crowd. \"Who's quasi-conservative out there in the celebrity land?\" The correct answer to this question is \"the actor Robert Duvall and that guy from Metallica\". But that's hardly the point: Palin's apparent ability to perceive all these multiple dimensions raises the serious possibility that she is operating from a plane of intelligence so elevated, so completely inaccessible to all but a few of the world's leading superstring theorists, that it wrongly appears to the rest of us very much like immense stupidity.</p> <p>Contrast Palin's fondness for \"the real America\" with the disdain for reality demonstrated by the anonymous George Bush aide who famously described the president's critics as belonging to \"the reality-based community\". (\"We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality,\" the source told the journalist Ron Suskind in a now legendary 2004 New York Times article.) Which is more worrying: that the Bush White House believed reality could be ignored, or that Palin thinks her opponents aren't real? Actually, don't answer that.</p> <p><strong>Making sure people show up at the polls on election day </strong>is crucially important work, of course, and one hesitates to mock any well-meaning effort to get out the vote. But can we make an exception for Ben &amp; Jerry's, the ice-cream company whose ostentatious stance of corporate community-mindedness as a marketing tool is almost as annoying as the cutesy names of their flavours? Fresh from getting free publicity from Cherries for Change, their pro-Obama repackaging of Cherry Garcia, the firm has launched a voter-reward campaign offering a free scoop of ice-cream for anyone who can prove they voted on November 4. \"Show us your 'I Voted' sticker, a photo of you in front of your polling station, do the I Voted Dance, or just tell us you voted!\" the company's website proclaims excitedly. Which would be a marvellous democracy-enhancing wheeze were it not for the fact that offering any kind of recompense for a vote where federal candidates are on the ballot is an offence under US law. \"If I were Ben &amp; Jerry's lawyer, I'd tell them to shut this down,\" writes Rick Hasen, an expert on voting legislation at Loyola law school in Los Angeles, and also, it would appear, a crotchety spoilsport who probably just needs a few more scoops of New York Super Fudge Chunk and a big hug.</p> <p><strong>Another voter-reward scheme that may be in breach of </strong>the law: John McCain's daughter, Meghan, has told New Hampshire voters that if her father wins there she'll have the state motto, Live Free or Die, tattooed on to her body. Not many things are to John McCain's credit at the moment, but one of them is the fact that he's letting his daughter join him on the campaign trail without dictating what she says to the press - a far cry from Chelsea Clinton's message-repeating appearances, let alone Mitt Romney's five sons, who during the primaries ran a strictly on-message and vaguely terrifying weblog, the Five Brothers Blog, in support of their disconcerting father. Meghan McCain, who runs an entirely amiable website at McCainBlogette.com, has called Barack Obama \"cute\", reported drunken evenings in karaoke bars on the trail, offered candid thoughts on her father's campaign strategies (Mike Huckabee as vice-president, she noted months ago, was \"not gonna happen\"), and spoken of the perils of dating a supporter of eccentric libertarian superhero Ron Paul: \"He collected Barbie dolls. I called my girlfriends after and was like, 'That's weird, right?'\" </p> <p>Turns out that there is a straight-talkin', likable maverick named McCain after all. What a pity they nominated that short-tempered, impetuous, negative-campaigning demagogue instead!</p> <p><strong>This week Oliver watched</strong> Sarah Palin's appearance on Saturday Night Live: \"She said almost nothing, so it was a triumph.\" <strong>He also spent</strong> far too long reading rightwing American blogs: \"You wouldn't believe the things I've heard about Michelle Obama. Which is just as well, because most of them are completely made up.\"</p>",
  "<p>Your poster series last week described Trevor McDonald as becoming the \"first black British newsreader\" in 1973, and Moira Stuart as becoming \"Britain's first black woman news presenter\" in 1981 (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2008/oct/13/black-history-month-timeline\">The Black History Timeline, October 13-17</a>).</p> <p>Not taking anything away from my excellent colleagues, I must put history right and state that in 1968 I made headlines in British newspapers when I was appointed one of three on-camera reporter/interviewers on Thames-TV's daily evening show, Today with Eamonn Andrews. </p> <p>It was the first time a black person had appeared on British TV in a non-entertainment role and, as I had been a journalist all my professional life, I enjoyed the job which involved interviewing everyone: Prime Minister Harold Wilson, movie star Michael Caine and round-the-world yachtsmen, as well as ordinary people in newsworthy situations.</p> <p>After nine months, though, my contract was terminated and I was told that the producers were under pressure from viewers who called in daily to say, \"Get that n****r off our screens.\" My producer tried to break it to me gently, but it still hurt, especially when I was replaced by an Australian girl.</p> <p>My next job was in a similar capacity with ATV-Birmingham's Today show, aired during a time when Enoch Powell had made black immigration a major issue. I could not get a hotel room in that city and had to return each night to London and commute each morning by train back to Birmingham, until I finally got a room at the YWCA.</p> <p>I remember having to listen without reacting when the production staff asked: \"What 'wog' story are we doing today?\" Or: \"If black people are so equal, how come they never painted the Mona Lisa?\"</p> <p>I was once sent to do a story where I had to swim one lap of a pool. I am a good enough swimmer to have swum Jamaica's Cross the Kingston Harbour race when I was 15; but as I knew I would be going on camera later that day, I kept my head and hair above water. Later that evening I sat and watched as the story unfolded: black people don't swim as well as whites because they won't put their heads underwater. </p> <p>I also remember coming back to the studio after doing a story on a miserably cold day to find that Enoch Powell had just left after doing a live interview on condition that \"the black girl\" was not there.</p> <p>My next (and most pleasant) job was as research assistant with the BBC Man Alive series produced by Desmond Wilcox. But after a few months, Chris Blackwell and Perry Henzell offered me a job as a public relations officer for the first Jamaican film, The Harder They Come, and I decided it was time to return home permanently in 1972.</p> <p>I have since continued my career as a journalist, writing columns, doing TV and radio broadcasts and making eight films, on issues of culture and black history. I am quite proud of having achieved this milestone in British race relations and I hope to publish my story one day.</p> <p>\u2022 Barbara Blake Hannah is an author, music journalist and film-maker, and a former senator in the Jamaican parliament<br><a href=\"mailto:jamediapro@hotmail.com\">jamediapro@hotmail.com</a></p>",

Even as the global financial crisis melts our pension funds and employment prospects like a blowtorch, it's not the end of the world. Spare a thought though for timid trainspotter Tim, hero of this delightful, deadpan Aussie sci-fi comedy, who stumbles into the apocalyptic cult-next-door during a powercut. To escape the imminent cataclysm they need a live sacrifice, and if they can't find a willing virgin, an unwilling infidel in pyjamas will do. Will Tim be their ticket off this doomed world to the Threbelian Galaxy? Deft, droll and lightly dusted with wacky, not wearisome CGI, it's the perfect antidote to those bank bail-out blues.</p> <h2> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2gBZwsXx8g\">Last Time in Clerkenwell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aniboom.com/video/295432/The-Black-Dogs-Progress/\">The Black Dog's Progress</a></h2> <p>Alex Budovsky's Royal Legion of Birds marched through the London film festival's international animation programme this week, and by some miracle (or oversight), the Clerkenwell cuckoos are also viewable online. In this crisp and catchy second instalment of his bird blitzkrieg, the worldwide Legions team up to battle an alien invasion of owls, wielding their secret weapon: the unstoppably infectious \"Abap-Boo\u2013Pudup \u2013 Boop-Poo\" chorus from Cloud Cuckoo Land by The Real Tuesday Weld. Enjoy how restlessly inventive Budovsky's retro woodcut graphics are, sending your gaze scuttling across the screen. Then pair this with a look at animator Stephen Irwin's accomplished and darkly disturbing The Black Dog's Progress, another monochrome oddity that makes your eyes work overtime. Black Dog's pen-scratched story is told ingeniously in looped scenes on simultaneous flipbook animations that track the horrors of his life on the streets, until the scribbled screen is humming with menace. Visually and emotionally unsettling, it's a highly original piece (with a nod to Hogarth) that is strictly adult fare.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ifc.com/video/Web-Series/Young-American-Bodies/1529447711\">Young American Bodies: Episode One</a></h2> <p>Despite being the brainchild of Joe \"Hannah Takes The Stairs\" Swanberg, this hugely popular angst-and-sex indie soap opera is as much soft-core as mumblecore, with plenty of full-frontal frolics on show. Yet its thoughtful cinema-verite style, faithfully tracking the awkward real-time conversations and knotty romances of a flat full of Chicago twentysomethings, elevates it way above the web's current rush of \"naked co-ed\" drama series. Keeping the performances as real as the characters' dilemmas, Swanberg directs, writes and stars as geeky, lovelorn Ben, crankily in love with the neurotically promiscuous Maggie in this opening series. Cybercinema is currently hopelessly in thrall to its quirky Cassavetes-lite style, dawdling pace, and awkward couplings, and so will you be.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.depict.org/shortlists/232\">DepicT: Happy Families \u2013 Mr Peep The Womanizer</a></h2> <p>Even the busiest office drone amongst you can spare a lunchtime to fossick through the 90-second wonders in DepicT 2008's short film competition. Suck 'em and see, and vote online to crown your favourite in the Encounters short film festival in Bristol on November 22. They are all pretty tasty, but we are championing Mole Hill's eccentric rhyming take on the well-loved Victorian card game, whose charming but cruel story of how a peeping tom's eyes run away with him is executed in a wonderful, wobbly parody of the original John Jaques illustrations. And if you haven't already seen No-One Is Illegal, George Sander Jackson's fluid, haunting animation of a Malawian asylum seeker's agonising trip through the system, make sure to remedy this oversight immediately. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.funlittlemovies.com/turbodates.html\">Turbo Dates: Men Are From Mars</a></h2> <p>Wading through the high-profile comedy sites that have launched recently, Cybercinema has been almost invariably disappointed. FunnyOrDie UK has been, well, deathly, to date, and so far Seth McFarlane's Comedy Cavalcades are one-gag wonders from the guy behind The Family Guy. So we were happy to fall over this tucked-away test site for a series of uniformly sleek and witty playlets spoofing speed dating, created by Pirates of the Caribbean scribe Terry Rossio with Jocelyn Stamat. This time around, Courteney can't figure out the oddly robotic Brad, who claims to have come from a far galaxy for mating purposes (\"Let us trade secretions. The Federation allows your roommate to join us!\"). Is he a nerdy social misfit trying to weasel a threesome, or can she really save humankind with a hook-up? </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/relevance/search/IN%C3%81CIO/video/x1h4j3_tarantinos-mind?from=rss\">Tarantino's Mind</a></h2> <p>To celebrate production commencing on Inglorious Bastards, we've been brushing up our Tarantino trivia with this chic, well-crafted two-hander. Brazilian directing duo 300ml make very canny use of clips (and City of God star Seu Jorge) to create a unified field of conspiracy theory for Tarantino's movies, as a pair of fanboys engage in heated debate in a Rio diner as to whether his movies are actually one giant epic, divided into several episodes. Reflect on whether The Bride and Mia Wallace are actually the same person, if that famous Pulp Fiction twinkling briefcase contains the Reservoir Dog diamonds, why Roger Federer and Tarantino are never seen together, and make your own mind up. Don't overlook the supremely elegant paper structure listing Tarantino's recurrent obsessions that constructs itself under the opening credits, or we will have to get medieval on your ass.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.atom.com/funny_videos/president_bear_1/\">President Bear: Episode 1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.atom.com/funny_videos/president_bear_2/\">Episode 2</a></h2> <p>Oprah may be backing Obama, and Sylvester Stallone endorsing McCain, but this month Cybercinema is rooting for President \"Grizzly\" Anderson, star of Atom's comic spoof. After a medical emergency demands that his brain be transplanted into a bear (\"They're stern yet cuddly, and native to America\") the president finds his approval ratings way down. Can he conquer his urge to eat the White House press corps, and maul his ambitious vice-president like a lost hiker? Or will those prank calls on the hotline phone about \"lost pic-er-nic baskets in Jellystone Park\" get him roaring at the Russians? Either way, he's got our vote.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>There's a case to be made for Dirk Kuyt being Liverpool's player of the season so far.</strong> He rescued them from potential embarrassment against Standard Liege. He set up the winner against Manchester United. And he's scored four in the last three. So what do you think has happened here, then?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Former Liverpool pair Luis Garcia and Flo-Po start:</strong> Franco, Seitaridis, Perea, Joshua, Antonio Lopez, Camacho, Maniche, Luis Garcia, Simao, Forlan, Sinama Pongolle.<br>Subs: Bernabe, Pernia, Heitinga, Raul Garcia, Aguero, Paulo Assuncao, Miguel.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Dirk, however, is on the bench. And why on earth did Benitez spend \u00a37m - <em>\u00a37m!!!</em> - for Andrea Dossena?</strong> Reina, Arbeloa, Carragher, Agger, Dossena, Mascherano, Alonso, Benayoun, Gerrard, Riera, Keane.<br>Subs: Cavalieri, Aurelio, Pennant, Kuyt, Babel, Leiva Lucas, Darby.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Claus Bo Larsen (Denmark)</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Kick off, incidentally, is at:</strong> 7.45pm. But you knew that already.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>The Dirk Kuyt Love-In begins now:</strong> \"Sure he hasn't always been pretty or flashy, and I've obviously cursed his name on several occasions, but why do the Kop faithful, myself included, look down on Kuyt so much?\" wonders John Scott. \"Clearly he finishes, which is more than we can say for others out there on the pitch.\" There's also the fact that <em>[MBM hack pops on Titfer of Piety and Righteousness at staunchly Presbyterian non-jaunty angle in order to witter on about old-school values]</em> he doesn't gad around nightclubs, choosing instead to stay indoors with his wife and raise money for his poor-kiddies charity. Sniff.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Meanwhile, in case this gets boring, which, well, y'know, why not pop over to our Food and Drink blog and enjoy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/allegra-mcevedy-kitchen-clickalong\">Allegra McEvedy's vegetarian kitchen clickalong</a>?</strong></p> <p>Now, don't be embarrassing yourselves, make sure you bring a bottle.

Benayoun tries to get on the end of a long ball but is, unbelievably, pulled back by the referee for strong-arm tactics in the Atletico box.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Neither team has put more than two passes together yet. \"My brother Drew and I have devised the theory that the more awful and confounding Kuyt plays, and the more you hurl abuse at him, the more likely he is to pop up and score a crucial goal,\" Ty Kreft. \"Just a theory, but we've put it to the test many times this season and our findings are very interesting indeed.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> You want 'em? We got 'em! Our televisions are down. Well, they're not down, but for some reason all the channels on our in-house system are suddenly showing dodgy dating channels and general bongo. Maybe the Guardian Towers janitor is feeling particularly lonely tonight. You don't get this sort of farce with Allegra McEvedy.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>There is one box which still works, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/22/championsleague-chelsea-roma\">Smyth</a> had already blagged it.</strong> Many apologies.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 min: GOAL!!! Atletico Madrid 0-1 Liverpool.</strong> Yes, apparently this has happened, Robbie Keane the scorer. Hold on, let me wrest the controls of Special Box off Smyth, perhaps I can find out what went on. This is a farce for which we can only apologise.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 min, now I've found out what happened:</strong> A lovely sidefooted through ball from Gerrard to Keane, who races clear and slips the ball confidently past the advancing Leo Franco. There's a question that Keane was <em>just</em> offside, but a lovely finish so let's give him it. Dirk Who?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Dossena taPLEASEkes the ball up on the leINSERTft, cuts inside and pasYOURses to Alonso, who advaSKYnces towards the area and takes a wild swipVIEWINGe at goal. The effort is a good ten feCARDet over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Right, we're back. Gerrard curls in a lovely low cross from the right. Keane is clear in the centre and should hammer the ball home from six yards, but manages to let it sail between his legs and harmlessly away. Meanwhile it appears I have given you a bum steer re tasty tonic wines. \"The last time I looked Buckfast was a mere \u00a35.29 in Morrisons,\" reports Chris McFarlane. \"Tell me your supplier and I'll flog it to the winos here in Glasgow for a healthy profit.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Right, I'm now on a new machine with a working television in front of it. (It's a <a href=\"http://www.bairdone.com/tv12b.gif\">Baird One</a>, fact fans.) I won't be able to log in and pick up any of your emails until half time, however. Seeing the only one I've printed in the last 23 minutes has been about the price of Buckfast, I don't think anybody's losing out here.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> There's no point me trying to wing it, I'm going to have to go with some received wisdom from Sky. God help us all. Atletico have, essentially, achieved absolutely nothing of note so far. Liverpool should be 2-0 up, not 1-0, while the only danger to Reina's goal has come right here, right now, Arbeloa heading weakly back to his keeper with Forlan in close attendance.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> I'm now back on my computer (don't ask) but the picture is still switching on and off intermittently. Poor Scott's a-cold! It does mean I can pick up your emails again, though. \"It's a shame you are missing this Scott because Dossena is playing out of his skin and well justifying the money,\" reports Stephen Bowden. \"Just went past five players and has generally had the most accomplished performance at left back you'll ever see. (This is not true of course, he's not worth seven pounds let alone seven million.)\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> You still here?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>38 min: COO! MOVING PICTURES FROM A MAGIC LANTERN!</strong> The TV's back on, just in time to see Riera booked for diving in the Atletico box. Antonio Lopez sticks his back-heel out, Riera looks to stumble over it, does so, and is reprimanded by the referee. He'd have done better to stay on his feet and take a dig, because there would have been space and time to do so.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Flo-Po slips a ball down the inside-left channel for Simao to chase after. He's upended by Arbeloa, who is booked for his lunge. Simao gets up to take the free kick himself, and lifts it harmlessly into Reina's arms. \"You print your emails?\" asks Colm Devlin, pouncing on my pain. \"Given the parlous state of all things technological at Guardian Towers, wouldn't you be better off transcribing them? Like Bubbles in Ab Fab?\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Maniche goes down in the box under a non-existent challenge from Benayoun. He's booked for this shameful nonsense. Jamie Woods has been thinking awhile about Liverpool's bottle-green tops (well, there's been nothing better to do): \"So is that where the peculiar English expression 'to bottle it' comes from? Because when you think about it, to bottle something should mean to preserve its qualities for a long time. And Liverpool have been crap since approximately 1991.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Atletico Madrid 0-1 Liverpool.</strong> That was fun! Wasn't it?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Mildly Amusing Sky Viewing Card / Technical Problems Joke dept:</strong> \"Keano or your dodgy Sky card: which one is more annoying?\" asks Stephen Bell. Your Sky card stops working for European matches which is the opposite of Keane who has technical issues in the Premiership.\" Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Stephen Bell, he'll be here all week!</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> Kun Aguero is on for little Luis Garcia. The second half starts as the first finished, with Liverpool in the ascendancy. Gerrard nearly springs Keane clear of the Atletico back line, in a facsimile copy of the build-up to the goal, except the ball is clanked away from danger by Perea, and Keane is not in an offside position.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Benayoun breaks clear down the right. Keane is free in the centre. It's going to be some cross if Keane is found, though... and that ain't some ball. Atletico are looking shaky at the back.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Well, if Keane's goal was offside, then this levels things out. Gerrard springs the Atletico back line with a lovely little reverse pass into the area. Benayoun is clear in the centre of the box and dinks cleverly into the net - but the whistle is blown for offside, outrageously so.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> This is getting ridiculous now. Flo-Po sets Forlan clear, and he's one on one with Reina. He should score - but doesn't get the chance, the linesman flagging for offside. He was <em>miles</em> onside, an utterly outrageous decision. \"Sorry to have to say this,\" writes K Weithaler, \"but I can actually remember Magic Lantern shows - cue ageist smart remark - and the scenes changed a lot quicker than you guys manage.\" Bah!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>53 min: THE LOVELY DIRK KUYT COMES ON!</strong> Keane has groin knack - not great news for the upcoming Chelsea clash at the weekend. \"Technical problems my arse,\" writes the suspicious (and foul-mouthed) Charlie Wilson. \"You and Smyth are both sitting in the pub swigging buckets of 9.8% ABV Restorative Health Provider, aren't you?\" This is textbook libel, right here!</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Benayoun bursts clear into the Atletico area but can't get his shot in and he's closed down. Then, down the other end, Forlan burst clear and - the terrible decisions just keep on coming - hammers a shot past Reina into the bottom-right corner of the net. That's a brilliant goal, and of course it's ruled out for offside. Carragher was way out of position and playing him on by a good two yards.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> This is all Atletico now. Simao hammers a low, hard shot from the left-hand edge of the Liverpool box. Reina fingertips it brilliantly, turning it onto his left-hand post. The ball bounces back across the face of goal and is scrambled away.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Liverpool are a complete shambles at present. They can't keep hold of the ball at all. To this end, Gerrard's 73-yard raking balls are deemed to be superfluous, Babel replacing him.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Agger - not Alonso, Agger - tries a shot from just inside his own half. It's on target, but not powerful enough to beat the backtracking Leo Franco.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Benayoun streams forward with Kuyt but a promising looking move flounders when a pass gets stuck under the latter's boots.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Liverpool are putting a stop to Atletico's gallop at the moment, stroking it around nicely around the centre of the park. The crowd, only minutes ago in a wild frenzy, have quietened down significantly.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Liverpool string ten or 12 passes around the front of the Atletico box. It's finally played in towards Riera but intercepted by Perea - who slices it wildly in the air. Neither Riera nor Kuyt are quick enough to pounce, and the ball's eventually shanked to safety.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Arbeloa shoulder charges Simao to the ground. The free kick into the area is wonderful, right into the mix, forcing Carragher to head the ball across the front of goal. Luckily for Liverpool, the ball somehow goes behind every single advancing Atletico forward - otherwise, six yards out, they would have been bound to score.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Simao feeds Forlan in the Liverpool area. The former Manchester United striker has space and time to turn, but dilly-dallies and is eventually crowded out. Atletico are coming back into this game again.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Three changes. Two of them this very minute - Miguel coming on for Flo-Po, Lucas coming on for Xabi Alonso - and one of them a couple of minutes back - Raul Garcia replacing Camacho.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Liverpool had a chance to wrap this game up here, but managed to balls up the situation majestically. Benayoun had the ball on the edge of the area with Kuyt in acres just to his left. A simple ball shifted wide would have seen the striker clear on goal, but Benayoun hesitates and Kuyt is flagged offside. To pop the slapstick cherry atop the comedy cake, Kuyt falls over chasing the ball anyway, doing one of those soft-shoe shuffles set in silent movies to a xylophone trill before inevitably hitting the deck.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Liverpool appear to have weathered the Atletico storm for the second time in this half.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Maniche latches onto a big up-and-under. He's one-on-one with Reina, but offside, for once a correct decision.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>83 min: GOAL!!! Atletico Madrid 1-1 Liverpool.</strong> Carragher lets a long ball down the right wing bounce. It lets Forlan in, and the striker rolls the ball across the area past Arbeloa and towards Simao who is free. Simao changes feet from right to left and, just before Carragher lunges in, hammers a delicious shot into the bottom-right corner. That had been coming, then it hadn't, then it had, then it hadn't, but it, er, probably had been overall.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> That was nearly the winner for Atletico. Forlan overhits a cross from the left, but the dipping ball is met sort-of-sweetly by Miguel, who volleys into the ground, the powerful effort bouncing up and heading for the top-right corner. Riena does wonderfully well to claw the ball away for a corner. Which is, Premier League style, wasted.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> And <em>that </em> was nearly the winner for Liverpool. Agger sends a raking 40-yarder to Kuyt down the right. The resulting cross is wonderful, and finds the head of Babel, diving in the centre, six yards out. He should score, but doesn't, heading wide right. Lovely football from Liverpool, and there's not been much of that this half.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Aguero breaks down the right and pulls the ball back towards Forlan; Mascherano is tracking back and hacks clear for a corner. The corner's wasted, but the move was worth mentioning as were it not for Mascherano, that might have easily been the winner. This is quite a finish to what has been a slightly disappointing game (the bits I've seen, anyway).</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Atletico Madrid 1-1 Liverpool.</strong> Well, Liverpool will be disappointed with the result, after holding onto the lead for so long, but on balance the result was fair enough. Apologies for the utter nonsense during the first half, by the way, but what can you do.</p>",
  "<p>If the saying that an hour is a long time in politics is true, then news that Barack Obama had cancelled rallies in the Midwest to visit his sick grandmother in Hawaii should have given John McCain some serious time to try to inflict damage on his Democratic opponent.</p> <p>Not so it seems. Suzanne Goldenberg writes in today's Guardian that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-johnmccain-colorado-barackobama\">McCain has \"given up\" on Colorado</a>, just a day after a campaign blitz in the battleground state by his running mate, Sarah Palin.

The $150m Obama raised in September represents only a part of the financial advantage he has amassed, says the Washington Post. </p> <p>He and the Democratic party committees supporting his campaign have $164m remaining in their collective accounts. Only a quarter of the $600m Obama has raised so far has come from small donations of $200 or less. Rich donors who have reached donation limits can contribute more through a Committee for Change.</p> <p>\"We kept running into donors who had maxed out to Obama Victory who wanted to do additional money and had the capacity to do it and were eager to do it,\" says Alan Kessler, a Philadelphia lawyer and fundraiser for the committee. Full steam ahead.</p> <p>Obama may not have to worry about his dollar count, but his vote count may be a different matter.

A \"perfect storm\", as Ewen MacAskill writes in today's Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008\">building in time for election day</a> on November 4. A combination of sky-high voter interest, new ballot machines and a shortage of poll staff could see another debacle. Remember Florida? Virginia is stepping up security at polling booths on November 4 for fear of unrest from angry people in queues and those unable to vote. Thousands of lawyers, yes lawyers - it is the US after all - are being recruited by Obama and McCain to police polling booths.</p> <p>The 12 states that could have problems on election day, according to a report by the Pew group, are Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia and Washington DC. </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama will be in Virginia and Indiana on Wednesday and Thursday before heading to Hawaii until Saturday. He has cancelled rallies in Madison, Wisconsin and Des Moines, Iowa. McCain returns to New Hampshire then on to two rallies in Ohio with his running mate, Sarah Palin.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>According to the Pew Research Centre, Obama leads 52% against McCain's 38% - his widest margin yet. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News sounding has him opening a 10-point lead over his Republican opponent, while the averages worked out by <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com\">realclearpolitics.com</a> has him on 50.2% to McCain's 43% - a 7.2-point lead. </p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/21/uselections2008-barackobama\">Tomasky talk: Obama's grandmother</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/virginia-uselections2008\">Video: Younge America - who wants to be a Carilionaire?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-newmexico\">Video: Road trip, day 10: Frontier politics in Albuquerque</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008-michelleobama-cindymccain\">First ladies: Michelle and Cindy square up</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/22/obama-mccain-kerry-clinton\">Jonathan Freedland: Obama hasn't won it yet</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/22/uselections2008\">Ballot debacle predicted for November 4</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/22/palin-clothes-spending-ha_n_136740.html\">Huffington Post: Palin's $150K fashion shopping spree</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2008/10/rat_meet_sinking_ship.html\">Mother Jones: Rat, meet sinking ship</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/21/AR2008102102255.html\">Washington Post: Michael Gerson - The irony of Obama</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blogs/edcut/374010\">The Nation: Voter registration flashpoints</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/opinion/22dowd.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">New York Times: Maureen Dowd - What moved Colin Powell</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://voices.kansascity.com/node/2493\">Midwest voices: Shame on McCain and Palin for using an old code word for black</a></p> <h2>Quotes of the day</h2> <p>\u2022 On revelations that the Republican National Committee spent more than $150,000 on clothing and make-up for Sarah Palin: \"With all of the important issues facing the country right now, it's remarkable that we're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses\" - Republican spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt</p> <p>\u2022 \"It shows that Palin ain't like the rest of us ... the plumber's wife doesn't go to Nieman's or Saks\" - Democratic strategist Tom Matzzie</p>",
  "<p>It was founded by Benito Mussolini to promote Italian culture and over the years has played host to Ben Hur, Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York and many of Federico Fellini's best-known films. Now Rome's famous Cinecitta studios is to enter a new era after the <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994391.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">Italian government confirmed it is to sell its final stake</a> in the complex, meaning it will be entirely under private control for the first time.</p> <p>Cinecitta was set up by the Italian dictator in 1937 and was bombed by the allies during the second world war. Its 22 soundstages, including the legendary Studio 5 where Fellini worked, cover more than 2.1m square feet. </p> <p>In the 1950s Cinecitta was briefly nicknamed \"Hollywood on Tiber\" after playing host to a number of large-scale US productions, including Ben Hur and Quo Vadis. More recent productions include Spike Lee's Miracle at St Anna and Abel Ferrara's Go Go Tales. </p> <p>The privatisation process began in the 1980s after the studios came close to bankruptcy, but Silvio Berlusconi's government is now selling off its final 24% stake - with offers from outside Italy welcome - in a move which does not come as a surprise. Berlusconi's administration has taken a rather dim view of film-oriented spending since returning to power in May. The Rome film festival, which was founded only in 2006, has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/30/festivals.romefilmfestival\">threatened with budget cuts</a> by the Berlusconi-backed Gianni Alemanno, the city's new mayor and former neo-fascist youth leader. His campaign's print ads carried the slogan, \"Alemanno, for less cinema and more security\" - a reference to his central plank of fighting illegal immigration and cutting down the festival's costs.</p>",
  "<p>This comes a little late, because as you may know I've been in rehab / on a Kabbalah journey / ghost-designing Peaches Geldof's new fashion collection.</p> <p>But like it or not, this column likes to run the odd feelgood story, particularly since it turned out all our money is on fire and anything remaining is going to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/21/lloydstsbgroup-executivesalaries\">used by some guy who wears pink shirts and cufflinks with jeans to the pub at the weekend</a> to buy a Porsche come bonus season. Seriously, bankers: this is <em>so</em> not over. This hasn't even <em>started</em>.</p> <p>Anyway, trust the source of much-needed joy to be the marvellous George Hamilton, who Lost in Showbiz has adored forever, and who is just bringing out his autobiography \u2013 the charmingly indiscreet Don't Mind If I Do. As part of his promotional tour, George dropped in on US talkshow The View last week, where he casually revealed the following:</p> <p>\"When I was very young, 12, I had a relationship with my stepmother. She was about 28, 30. My father never knew about it. It was very normal. She didn't make me feel bad about it.\"</p> <p>\"Was I molested?\" he twinkled merrily in response to the hosts' spluttering. \"Damn, I'm down for it again!\"</p> <p>\"From my point of view it wasn't something so crazy,\" George then mused. \"I don't think it warped me in my life\u2026 It went on for a short period of time, when I was 12, and then strangely enough when I was of age and I was an actor in Hollywood I met her again. She was as beautiful, and we had a sort of follow-up.\"</p> <p>Majestic. Even the detail is weapons-grade Hamilton glamour \u2013 his stepmother initially approached the precocious tween in \"an ice-blue peignoir\" \u2013 and it's difficult to argue with his final verdict on the matter. </p> <p>'There was nothing film noir about it, \" he concludes, \"other than the hard fact that I had just betrayed my father and had sex with my stepmother.\"</p> <p>Of course, this revelation keenly evokes the words of Chazz Michael Michaels from the world cinema classic Blades of Glory. \"Troubled childhood?\" that lone wolf demands. \"If you call being a nine-year-old kid with a 35-year-old girlfriend troubled\u2026\"</p> <p>Anyway, George is to be thanked for this moment of hilariously off-colour levity, and we hope to see much more of him as the days darken.</p>",
  "<p>Chagos islanders evicted by the British government in the 1970s today lost their long-running battle to return to the Indian Ocean archipelago.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/24/politics.topstories3\"> islanders had previously won the right to return</a> to all islands except Diego Garcia, the main island, where there is a US military base.</p> <p>The 3-2 <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd081022/banc-1.htm\">ruling today by the law lords</a> overturns the islanders' victory and is the final stage of a legal battle that started 10 years ago.</p> <p>Lord Hoffmann ruled the government was entitled to legislate for a colony in the security interests of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>The US state department had argued that the islands might be useful to terrorists.</p> <p>Lord Hoffmann said: \"Some of these scenarios might be regarded as fanciful speculations, but in the current state of uncertainty the government is entitled to take the concerns of its ally into account.\"</p> <p>He rejected the argument by the Chagossians' lawyers that the government did not have the power to remove their right of abode in what is now known as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). \"The law gives it and the law may take it away,\" he said.</p> <p>Lord Rodger and Lord Carswell agreed. Lord Bingham and Lord Mance dissented.</p> <p>Olivier Bancoult, the evicted islander who put his name to the legal bid when it started in 1998, said after the ruling: \"We are deeply disappointed but of course we fight on. We are consulting our legal team to see what we can do.\"</p> <p>Bancoult urged ministers to read the statements of the dissenting judges. \"They should put an end to the shameless victimisation of Chagossians and adopt a lawful policy of facilitating our return to our homeland.\"</p> <p>Britain took the Chagos islands from France in the Napoleonic wars. In 1971 the British government used an immigration ordinance to remove the inhabitants compulsorily so Diego Garcia could be used as a US base.</p> <p>Both the divisional court and the court of appeal had previously ruled that the Chagossians could return to the outer islands. The Foreign Office appealed against those judgments to the law lords.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, David Miliband, welcomed today's judgment as a vindication of the government's decision to appeal. </p> <p>\"We do not seek to excuse the conduct of an earlier generation. Our appeal to the House of Lords was not about what happened in the 1960s and 1970s. It was about decisions taken in the international context of 2004.</p> <p>\"This required us to take into account issues of defence [and] security of the archipelago and the fact that an independent study had come down heavily against the feasibility of lasting resettlement of the outer islands of BIOT.\"</p> <p>In his dissenting judgment, Lord Bingham declared as void and unlawful a 2004 order to declare, without the authority of parliament, that no person had the right of abode in the Chagos islands.</p> <p>The power to legislate without going to parliament was \"an anachronistic survival\", he said. \"The duty of protection cannot ordinarily be discharged by removing and excluding the citizen from his homeland.\"</p> <p>Lord Mance said factors relied on as justifying the order were based on a \"remote and unlikely risk\" of large-scale resettlement of the outer Chagos islands.</p> <p>Richard Gifford, who represented the Chagossians, said: \"It has been the misfortune of the Chagos islanders that their passionate desire to return to their homeland has been caught up in the power politics of foreign policy for the past 40 years.</p> <p>\"Sadly, their struggle to regain their paradise lost has been dismissed on legal grounds, but the political possibilities remain open for parliament the British public and the international community to continue to support.\"</p> <p>The law lords were told during the hearing in July that Diego Garcia was regarded by the US since the 9/11 terrorist attacks as a \"defence facility of the highest importance ... a linchpin for the UK's allies\".</p> <p>The Foreign Office argued that allowing the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/01/humanrights.usforeignpolicy\"> Chagossians to return would be a \"precarious and costly\" </a> operation, and the United States had said that it would also present an unacceptable risk to its base.</p> <p>While there were \"undeniably unattractive aspects\" to what had happened to the islanders in the 1970s, that was no longer what the case was about, Jonathan Crow QC, for the foreign secretary, told the lords. \"The Chagossians do not own any territory,\" Crow said. \"They have no property rights on the islands at all. What is being asserted is a right of mass trespass.\"</p> <p>Ten years ago the Chagossians began legal action for the right to return, and <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/04/ewenmacaskill\"> in 2000 the divisional court ruled their eviction illegal </a>. The foreign secretary at the time, Robin Cook, agreed they should be allowed to return to all the islands except Diego Garcia. But after the September 11 attacks in 2001, the US said Diego Garcia had become an important base for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p>In 2004, the UK government issued orders in council that negated the court's ruling, but two years later the high court ruled in favour of the Chagossians. In May last year the government lost again at appeal. In November the lords granted the government leave to appeal but ordered it to pay all legal costs, regardless of the decision.</p> <p>A recent study found the small number of islanders likely to want to return to the archipelago permanently would be able to make a sustainable living.</p> <p>The study, backed by the Let Them Return campaign and written by John Howell, a former director of the Overseas Development Institute, suggested there were \"no physical, economic or environmental reasons\" to prevent resettlement on the islands of Peros Banhos and Salomon.</p> <p>Howell suggested about 150 families - fewer than 1,000 people and about a quarter of those entitled to go back - would want to return. Eco-tourism and fish exports could provide jobs and income. The total cost to the UK of resettlement would be about \u00a325m, the report said.</p>",

  "<p>Our new immigration minister, Phil Woolas, has passed his time in parliament as an unremarkable New Labour apparatchik. Like many former presidents of the National Union of Students his career path doesn't seem to have been unduly held back by principle. But one thing has singled him out and that is a visceral line of rhetoric on race and immigration. The BNP have a big presence in his Oldham constituency and he apparently decided years ago that, while he would contest the BNP electorally, politically it was safer to pander to their views. On one occasion Woolas rushed to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/minister-calls-for-veilwearing-teaching-assistant-to-be-sacked-420313.html\">condemn a Muslim teacher</a> for wearing a veil (without waiting for the industrial tribunal finding).</p> <p>Now as immigration minister he has adopted a keynote rightwing policy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/18/immigrationpolicy-immigration\">setting a limit on immigration</a>. This is pernicious. People do not distinguish between asylum seekers, economic migrants, the dependents of people lawfully settled here and even bona fide British citizens (like the writer) who happen to be non-white. And, as Phil Woolas knows perfectly well, he has no power to stop people seeking asylum, which would be in breach of our obligations under the European convention on human rights. There is freedom of movement within the European Union so he cannot stem that flow of economic migrants. And British residents have the right to bring their wives and children in, whatever their colour. So for Woolas to raise expectations that he can somehow cap, or even reverse, the number of immigrants in the country is futile. </p> <p>Worse is the way that Woolas is peddling every rightwing half-truth about immigration. He claims that the government has \"to face up to voters' concerns about the level of immigration\". But the truth is that the government has done little else but pander to white fears on the subject. Since 1997 the government has passed seven separate pieces of legislation on immigration and nationality, all designed to make the system tougher. Woolas claims that it is \"too easy to get into this country\". Tell that to my constituents who wait years to be joined by their partners or dependents. Or explain this to the young children detained for months in detention centres for no other crime than being the offspring of asylum seekers. The truth is that the legislation has never been more draconian, and asylum seekers and would-be migrants have never had fewer rights. If the numbers of migrants continue to rise it is because of the \"pull factor\" of an (up until now) booming but deregulated economy sucking in cheap labour. And there has been a global rise in the millions seeking asylum from war, pestilence and famine. </p> <p>We all know that a recession <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/immigration-immigrationpolicy\">leads inexorably</a> to a rise in racism and xenophobia, but a cap on immigration is not the answer.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 21 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Immigration</strong><br>The government was accused by shadow immigration minister Damian Green of being in \"chaos\" over the policy following a series of outspoken comments by immigration minister Phil Woolas. </p> <p>Green said Woolas had admitted that the government's policies had been \"a disaster\".</p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, branded Tory immigration policy as a \"ragbag of half-baked ideas\". Later Woolas said it was important that the issue was debated without anyone's motives being questioned. He quipped: \"I suspect that it will not receive as many column inches as short interviews over the weekend but that is just the nature of the beast,\"</p> <p><strong>Small businesses</strong><br>Small businesses are facing the greatest threat Britain has seen for more than 70 years, the shadow business secretary, Alan Duncan, warned. He said the prognosis was \"dire\" and many firms were already predicting that economic pressures were going to \"drive them to extinction\". Duncan attacked the \"folly\" of Gordon Brown, who did not save money for the \"bad times\" during his decade-long reign as chancellor.</p> <p>Business minister Pat McFadden said: \"Faced with the threat of severe financial instability, this government has acted to restore stability to the banking system and in so doing we have protected the essential foundation upon which small and medium-sized businesses operate.\"</p> <p><strong>Thames estuary airport</strong><br>The transport secretary, Geoff Hoon, dismissed the idea of building a new airport in the Thames estuary as \"simply not practical\". He said environmental concerns and the risk of aeroplanes hitting birds were just two reasons why such a project could not go ahead.</p> <p><strong>knife crime in Cryodon</strong><br>The army should be drafted in to patrol the streets of a London borough to try to stop a spate of knife killings, independent Andrew Pelling (Croydon Central) urged. He called for the solution in a bid to prevent further deaths in his constituency and increase respect for the authorities. Croydon had a \"justified reputation\" as having the highest number of deaths caused by knives in the UK, he claimed.</p> <p><strong>Black Police Association</strong><br>The decision by the Black Police Association to discourage black and Asian people from joining the Metropolitan Police was an \"absolute disgrace\", Tory Philip Hollobone (Kettering) protested. Junior equality minister Maria Eagle said the BPA was a \"self-organised group\" that was entitled to say what it wished about the experience of black people in the police.</p> <p><strong>Intelligence and security committee</strong><br>Former Foreign Office minister Kim Howells has been appointed to head the committee overseeing spies and security services, the prime minister said. Howells lost his role as Middle East minister in this month's reshuffle. He takes over as chairman of the cross-party intelligence and security committee from former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, now housing minister.</p> <p><strong>Electrification of the Midland main line</strong><br>Hoon pledged to look \"very closely\" at the case for electrification of the Midland main line. Labour's Sir Peter Soulsby (Leicester S) said only by electrification could \"significant improvements\" be made to services on the route.</p> <p>The transport secretary, who represents Ashfield, said he took a \"close personal interest\" in the line, as a regular user of it. \"I certainly share my predecessor's enthusiasm for electrification.\"</p> <p><strong>Rail nationalistation</strong><br>Labour's Rob Marris (Wolverhampton SW) pressed the case for rail nationalisation, saying that to improve services and reduce congestion \"we should nationalise the railways - just as we are doing with the banks - by not renewing the franchises as they fall due\". Mr Hoon said: \"I'm sorry you take that view of the contribution made by train operating companies. I probably would, on balance, resist your invitation.\"</p> <p><strong>Non-jury inquests</strong><br>Government plans for non-jury inquests and \"specially appointed\" coroners, withdrawn from the counter-terrorism bill, came under renewed attack from Tories and Liberal Democrats. Security minister Lord West of Spithead confirmed last week that the withdrawn clauses would be included in legislation next session.</p> <p>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for Lib Dems, stressed the need for an independent coroner and jury for those shot dead by police or who had died in custody. \"It is critical for the confidence of society that it is not seen that it was some executive decision followed by an 'executive' inquest.\" For the Tories, Lord Kingsland, said: \"I share many of the hesitations expressed by Lady Miller.\"</p> <p><strong>Foreign seafarers' pay</strong><br>Ministers were urged to plug a legislative \"loophole\" that allows foreign seafarers, sailing between British ports, to be paid less than \u00a32 an hour. Labour's Gwyn Prosser (Dover) called for the \"exploitation\" to be ended by ensuring such workers were entitled to the minimum wage. Shipping minister Jim Fitzpatrick said: \"Any changes to minimum wage legislation would need to be consistent with international law. We are trying to address this question.\"</p> <p><strong>Driving instructors convicted of sexual offences</strong><br>A loophole allowing driving instructors convicted of sexual assaults to continue teaching pupils must be closed, Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie (Dunfermline and Fife W) demanded. His driving instructors convicted of sexual offences (suspension) bill would allow immediate suspension from the register of instructors convicted of sex attacks. It gained its first reading but stands no chance of becoming law.</p> <p><strong>Paul Myners</strong><br>City minister Paul Myners, former Marks and Spencer chairman, took his Lords seat.</p> <p><strong>NHS direct</strong><br>Each call made to NHS Direct last year cost the taxpayer more than \u00a325, it emerged. Figures disclosed by health minister Ben Bradshaw showed the average cost to the public purse of calls to the health advice line was \u00a325.53. With 4,858,000 calls in 2007-8, the total cost added up to \u00a3124,024,740.</p>",
