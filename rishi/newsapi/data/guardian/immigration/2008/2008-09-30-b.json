  "<p>The world will have to take drastic action within two years to reduce greenhouse gas pollution if it is to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a new study warns.</p> <p>Weeks before world leaders meet to discuss the next big international treaty on cutting emissions, the scale of risk posed by failing to act rapidly is spelt out today by the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre.</p> <p>The study shows that cutting global emissions by 3% a year from 2010 offers the only possible hope of avoiding a global temperature rise of more than 2C - widely recognised as the threshold beyond which the worst impacts of sea level rise and drought become a significant risk.</p> <p>In the early years, at least, responsibility for such deep cuts in emissions would have to be borne by the UK and other rich countries, which are responsible for most of the historic build-up in emissions. </p> <p>It raises the prospect of far-reaching changes, including a rapid spread in community renewable energy and wave and tide power, improvements in public transport, big shifts to cycling and walking and changes in diet. It would also lead to huge pressure for the UK to abandon plans for a third runway at Heathrow and new coal-fired power stations.</p> <p>The warning from the Hadley Centre is likely to cause widespread concern, especially as the Met Office has a reputation for taking a cautious approach. It advises the UK government, the United Nations and other governments and businesses.</p> <p>Writing in today's Guardian, Vicky Pope, the Met Office's leading adviser on climate change to the government, warns that failure by governments to agree to \"large and early\" cuts or to meet those targets in future \"could have worrying and significant consequences for the world's climate\".</p> <p>Such a deal will be regarded as all but impossible by many experts as the 2010 deadline is soon after a big international meeting in Copenhagen in December next year, when the UN hopes a treaty will be signed.</p> <p>Andy Atkins, executive director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"Tactically we have to point out the opportunities and make it clear to them we have to act.\"</p> <p>Others called for the Met Office's warning to spur the UK and other countries to more urgent action at the big UN meetings in Poznan, Poland, in December and in Copenhagen at the end of next year, when a replacement for the Kyoto protocol is due to be agreed. </p> <p>So far, leaders of the G8 group of leading industrial nations have signalled support for a 50% cut in emissions, but have not pledged higher targets for their own countries. </p> <p>\"The new science should raise our ambition levels rather than [make us] back off,\" said Paul Cook, advocacy director of the development charity Tearfund. \"It's a big shift but it's do-able.\"</p> <p>The Hadley Centre analysed three possible agreements to cut global emissions, ranging from \"early and rapid\" to \"late and slow\" cuts, and compared them with what would happen if no action were taken. It found that if cuts begin in 2010 and quickly reach 3% a year then the most likely mid-range forecast temperature rise would be 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This is based on cutting emissions by 50% globally by the middle of the century, as advocated by the UN and accepted by many national governments. </p> <p>By comparison, an \"early but slow\" decline, beginning in 2010 but at a more modest level of 1% a year, would lead to likely temperature rises of 2.9C by the end of the century, and a \"late and slow\" decline beginning in 2030 would generate likely temperature increases of 4C by 2100.</p> <p>At 2C, scientists have warned that at least one fifth of species are at risk of extinction and 1 to 2 billion people could suffer increased water stress; above 2C plants and soil significantly reduce the amount of carbon they absorb; and above 4C experts warn there is a danger of passing a \"tipping point\" at which methane release from permafrost and the collapse of big ice sheets accelerate the problems.</p> <p>The Met Office's researchers also looked at what would happen if reductions began later but were then steeper: \"It looked very like the 'early but slow' [scenario],\" Pope told the Guardian. The reason delays cause greater impacts is that in the intervening years carbon would build up in the atmosphere, where it remains for a century.</p> <p>Even more worrying than the \"most likely\" central projections are the \"worst case outcomes\", says Pope. Even for the optimistic \"early and rapid\" cuts there was a chance the temperature could rise by 2.8C - and any delay in making cuts ran the risk of the global thermometer coming close to or exceeding the crucial 4C figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338146091\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/30/EMISSIONS2_0110.gif\" alt=\"EMISSIONS2_0110.gif\" width=\"476\" height=\"526\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Professor Bob Watson, chief scientific adviser for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said the results showed the urgency of an international agreement at the UN's conference in Copenhagen. \"If we act now, maybe we have got a fighting chance,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>As well as a new breed of musicians, the British pop and rock music upheaval of the 1960s produced a clutch of young music business moguls who created their own rules as they went along. One such was Bryan Morrison, who has died aged 66 after two years in a coma following a polo accident. Morrison was closely associated with the careers of Pink Floyd, the Bee Gees and, later, the Jam and George Michael. He was equally successful in applying his showbusiness nous to polo, which he helped to revolutionise as a club owner and player.</p> <p>The 1980s new romantic musician and club owner Richard Strange once described Morrison as \"visually conforming to the most crudely drawn caricature of a cigar-chomping East End Jewish wide-boy\" while in fact being \"a self-educated man of astonishing flair and instinct, charismatic and confident to the point of arrogance\". Morrison's cockney accent belied his lower-middle-class background as the son of an accountant from Hackney, east London. </p> <p>At school he excelled at art and design and he went to study at the Central School of Art at the beginning of the 60s. He was a contemporary of Dick Taylor, a guitarist who had rehearsed with future members of the Rolling Stones before forming his own R&amp;B band, the Pretty Things. During 1963 the group built up its reputation on the London club and student union circuit, and Morrison was prevailed upon to assist the Pretty Things' move into a full-time musical career.</p> <p>Morrison's skills as a salesman brought the group more engagements and a recording contract. He soon took on other clients and over the next five years the Bryan Morrison Agency became one of the leading London booking agents for R&amp;B and progressive rock, as well as organising tours for US acts. He also became the exclusive booker for such \"in\" London clubs as Blaises, the Cromwellian and the Revolution, in Bruton Street, Mayfair, above which he had his office. Among the groups who passed through its doors were Fairport Convention and the Incredible String Band and, at one stage, the future polo associate of the Prince of Wales was the agent of choice for the underground bands of Notting Hill such as Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Deviants and the Pink Fairies.</p> <p>Pink Floyd was the most important band represented by the agency in the mid-1960s and Morrison helped to start their recording career when he invited Norman Smith of EMI Records to attend a performance at the UFO Club. Soon afterwards, he made his first fortune by selling the agency to Nems, the company originally formed by the Beatles manager Brian Epstein. Morrison and his staff joined Nems and one of his associates, Steve O'Rourke, went on to become Pink Floyd's manager.</p> <p>For some time after the founder member Syd Barrett left the group, Morrison helped to look after his business interests. As Barrett's behaviour became more erratic with the onset of mental illness, Morrison managed his royalties and arranged some of his final music press interviews that took place at Bruton Street. In later years, as the cult around Barrett grew, Morrison, often brusquely, tried to protect his privacy. His continuing regard for Syd was evident in his choice of Crazy Diamond (from the Pink Floyd song about Barrett) as the title of his own memoirs, which remain unpublished.</p> <p>During the 1970s, Morrison focused on his music publishing interests. As well as songs by Barrett, he published compositions by Paul Weller of the Jam, and by the Bee Gees, one of which was the B-side of the multi-million-selling single Night Fever. However, his biggest coup came in the early 1980s, when, with a new partner, Dick Leahy, he signed a publishing contract with two suburban lads recording as Wham! Morrison Leahy Music went on to publish all the Wham! hits and many of George Michael's solo songs.</p> <p>By this time Morrison had discovered the second great passion of his career. He once described the first time he attended a polo match as \"eight guys tearing down the field like maniacs whacking the ball about. My heart leapt and I was hooked.\" He became an accomplished player, one of the few amateurs to attain a handicap of three. He joined the Guards Polo Club but was appalled at its facilities, \"horrible 1950s drab with a single, crummy, ice-cold shower.\" When his suggestions for improvement were instantly rejected, he bought a former racing stables in Berkshire and designed his own club. The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club opened in 1985 and has been credited with making polo a fashionable pursuit. Its members have included Prince Charles and his sons, and the Duchess of York's father, Major Ronald Ferguson, was the club sponsorship manager. The polo club has been valued at \u00a312m and, in 2004, the Sunday Times rich list calculated Morrison's personal wealth to be \u00a360m.</p> <p>He was less involved in the music business in his later years, although his Morrison Music purchased a majority stake in Snapper Music, the British licensee of the Sun rock'n'roll catalogue, in 2005. The following year a polo accident left him in a coma with severe brain injuries. He did not regain consciousness. </p> <p>Morrison is survived by his wife Greta, a former model, his son Jamie, a polo player, and his daughter Karina, a film-maker.</p> <p>\u2022 Bryan Morrison, music publisher and polo club owner, born August 14 1942; died September 27 2008</p>",
  "<p>Zeus once let fly two eagles from the ends of the world: one from the east and one from the west. They soared high over oceans, mountains, forests and plains, until they met at the very centre of the earth, its omphalos, or navel. On this spot, a temple to Apollo was dedicated, the home of the Delphic oracle, where those who wished for insight into their past, present or future might come to consult the god. The questioner would be led into the temple's dark heart. In the gloom, the visitor would more sense than see the Pythia - the laurel-crowned woman who acted as the sacred conduit for the god's communications. In a trance, amid the heady fumes of burning laurel and barley, she would begin her utterances: divinely inspired fragments that the priests would interpret and fashion. But as the inquirer passed under the temple colonnade, before he stepped into the inner sanctum itself, he would have seen some letters carved into the portico: gnothi seauton - \"know thyself \".</p> <p>This extraordinary challenge to achieve self-knowledge still rings out commandingly. It captures one of the things that is most exciting about ancient Greece: from the writings of its greatest thinkers and authors what stands out is an almost visceral need to question, to probe, to debate, to turn accepted opinion on its head - whether the subject of inquiry is the state of the human heart or the nature of justice.</p> <p>The intellectual achievements of the ancient Greeks were quite simply extraordinary. They shaped the basic disciplines and genres in which we still organise thought: from poetry to drama, from philosophy to history, from natural history, medicine and ethnography to political science. We have been inexorably moulded by ancient Greece: the way we think about right and wrong, about the nature of beauty, goodness and knowledge; the way we conceive of what it is to be a mortal being amid the immensity of the universe; the way we talk about the past, and our ambiguous relationship with war; the way we discuss politics and citizenship. The tracks that lead back from our world to the Greeks' are narrow, meandering, sometimes virtually rubbed out or invisible - but they are there. What the Greeks did and said still casts light on what we say and do; by looking at the Greeks we can understand more about ourselves. The Greeks, in short, can help us answer their own challenge of \"know thyself \".</p> <p>The world of \"ancient Greece\" was certainly not confined geographically to the Greek mainland, nor was it a single entity. There were Greek settlements dotted all around the Mediterranean, from Marseilles in the west, to the coast of Asia Minor in the east. In fact, many of the most glamorous intellectuals of ancient Greece came from the coastline of what is now western Turkey. Nor is \"Greece\" (in Greek Hellas) a term that would necessarily have been widely understood. The Greek world was made up of hundreds of politically independent, often disputatious city-states, each with separate systems of government, locally distinct religious cults, even different calendars and names for the months of the year. </p> <p>When we think of \"ancient Greece\", we tend to be drawn to just one of these hundreds of city-states, and at one particular time: Athens in the fifth century BC. This is perfectly understandable, as during its flowering of power between the routing of the Persians in 479 BC and its own crushing by Sparta in 404 BC, it was a magnet for writers, artists and thinkers from all over the Greek world, and the scene of the most exciting intellectual revolution that the world has ever witnessed. The Athenians have always made the most noise; and they left us an abundance of literary masterpieces, not least the great dramas of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, written for performance at the Athenian festival called the City Dionysia. Still, it is best to remember that the Athenians weren't the only Greeks, nor were they even \"representative\" Greeks. </p> <p>So, it is worth thinking about ancient Greece because it brings us a perspective on the way we live now, from our politics to our sense of history. And reading the Greeks is also a source of unbounded enrichment and pleasure. But even more important than all this, perhaps, is the idea of \"ancient Greece\" not simply as a specific place or a time, but a realm where the imagination, the emotions and the intellect can roam free. We will never completely grasp ancient Greece. An enormous wealth of literature, art, architecture and other artefacts have survived but, for every survival, there are a thousand losses. We have 20 dramas by Euripides, but we know that his complete works numbered 90 plays. For Aeschylus, we have seven out of 90 extant. And for Sophocles, just seven out of 123. Works that were seen as masterpieces in antiquity are nothing but dust, ashes and the occasional quote in other texts.</p> <p>For me, the writing of Plato acts as a wonderful metaphor for our relationship with ancient Greece. Plato did not write in the form of treatises; he did not propound theories, even. His philosophy is almost always written as dialogues between two or more speakers: its very form encapsulates disagreement, debate and provisional answers rather than unshakeable dogma. Incompleteness, as it were, is at its heart. In the same way, knowledge of ancient Greece is fugitive, fragile, difficult to grasp. When the mind travels to ancient Greece, it embarks on a quest - an idea CP Cavafy, the great modern Greek poet, put beautifully in his poem Ithaca, which takes the idea of Odysseus' homecoming: </p> <p>When you set out for distant Ithaca, <br>fervently wish your journey may be long, - <br>full of adventures and with much to learn.</p> <p>And, as we set out on that long but rewarding journey towards Ithaca, we will come closer to answering that ancient challenge: gnothi seauton</p> <h2>Do you speak more Greek than you think? </h2> <p><strong>Spartan</strong><br>As in, \"Tarquin, I know the minimalist look is right up your street, but don't you think the room looks a little spartan with the actual floorboards removed?\"</p> <p>Simple, severe, lacking in comfort: that does in fact pretty much sum up what we know about the life of the Spartans. Despite its position as a Greek military superpower, the place had none of the kind of impressive architecture that would have overwhelmed the eye of a fifth-century visitor to Athens. Famously, Sparta also lacked walls or fortifications (it demonstrated that the inhabitants were such butch soldiers they didn't need nancy-boy walls to keep them safe). But being \"Spartan\" also meant adhering to a system of iron discipline, with boys taken out of their families for military training at the age of seven and, uniquely for ancient Greece, girls also given an education and athletic training - the better, presumably, to give birth to warrior sons. This was the background that produced the toughies who, vastly outnumbered, held off the Persians at Thermopylae, until all 300 were slaughtered. Dedication, bravery and suicidal bloodymindedness are thus also Spartan virtues.</p> <p><strong>Laconic</strong><br>As in, \"Darling, I know being a teenage boy is all about communicating in grunts, but if you could descend from your laconic monosyllables occasionally, I'd be terribly grateful.\"</p> <p>Laconia was the region of the Peloponnese that Sparta controlled; \"laconic\" refers to another Spartan quality: a severe, economic, and sometimes dryly witty way with words. </p> <p><strong>Aegis</strong><br>As in, \"Don't worry, Henry, the animal care comes under the aegis of the National Donkey Protection League, which I am sure has impeccable standards.\"</p> <p>Frankly, the aegis - a symbol of divine power - has always struck me as one of the weirdest things about the Greek gods. I can do no better than quote the Oxford Classical Dictionary, which describes it as an \"all-round bib with scales, fringed with snakes' heads and normally decorated with the gorgoneion\". (Gorgoneion being classicist-speak for the head of the Gorgon Medusa.) The aegis, the entry helpfully adds, may sometimes be tasselled. I have also heard it described as looking like a sporran.</p> <p><strong>Thespian</strong><br>As in, \"Brenda has marvellous talents as a thespian, you know. You should see her Lady Bracknell.\"</p> <p>Thespis was the man who, according to Aristotle, \"invented\" Greek drama, adding a prologue and speech to what had previously been a choral performance. </p> <p><strong>Herculean</strong><br>As in, \"Cleaning the bathroom and kitchen floors, Muriel, seems to me to be a labour of Herculean proportions.\"</p> <p>Hercules is the Romanised name of Heracles, the greatest of all heroes, and one of the few mortals to attain the status of a god. The labours, set him by Eurystheus, king of Argos, were 12 in number. Heracles had something of a problem with madness and mass murder: the labours were done to expiate the killing of his wife Megara and their children, which he committed in a bout of insanity visited on him by the goddess Hera. Another story has him killing the father and brothers of his girlfriend Iole. To purify himself, he worked for the queen of Lydia, Omphale, for three years. The twist was that he had to do this as a woman - spinning and weaving, in drag, a scene vividly depicted on a Roman well-head in the Townley Collection of Roman antiquities in the basement of the British Museum.</p> <p><strong>Tantalising</strong><br>As in, \"I've just caught a tantalising glimpse of Frank's homemade apricot ice cream and I can't wait to taste it.\"</p> <p>From Tantalus, one of the very first generations of mortals. Invited by the gods to dine on Mount Olympus, he decided to kill, cook and serve up his son Pelops to see whether his hosts would detect the forbidden food (as you do). Demeter, distracted by her grief for her daughter Persephone, was the only immortal who tucked in, polishing off a shoulder. The gods reconstructed Pelops and brought him back to life, with a prosthetic shoulder made from ivory. Tantalus's eternal punishment in the Underworld was to stand in a pool that drained away when he tried to drink from it and beneath branches groaning with fruit that drew away when he reached for them. A tantalus is also a lockable stand for a set of decanters. You can see the booze, but you can't get at it without the key ...</p> <p><strong>Colossal</strong><br>As in, \"I'm heading for a colossal overdraft. Drinks on you, I'm afraid.\"</p> <p>From the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the seven ancient wonders of the world. In 305 BC, Rhodes was attacked by the Macedonian Demetrius Poliorcetes and successfully saw off a year-long siege. Demetrius abandoned his siege equipment on the island, and the grateful Rhodians used the proceeds from the sale of all that to erect a 33m statue to their patron, Helios, the sun god. However, it stood for only 56 years; an earthquake in about 226 BC undermined the statue at the knee. Even in ruins it still excited visitors, such as the Roman writer Pliny, who noted that its thumb was too big for most men to be able to clasp in their arms, and that its very fingers were bigger than most ordinary statues. The Statue of Liberty is inspired by the Colossus of Rhodes.</p> <p><strong>Draconian</strong><br>As in, \"Miss, don't you think punishing smoking with a public flogging is a bit draconian?\"</p> <p>Draco, by tradition, set down the first Athenian law code in 621 or 620 BC, the first time the city's laws had been put in writing and displayed in public. Evidence is thin as to what these laws comprised: but according to tradition, it was the death penalty for pretty much everything. One Athenian in the fourth century quipped that Draco wrote his laws in blood rather than ink. \"Draconian\" is always a negative word in English, but you could argue that setting forth a state's laws in public for the first time was, in its way, a reforming measure ... though Draco's code was itself reformed soon enough, in 594/3 BC by Solon, who repealed everything except the law on homicide.</p> <p>The boy's name Draco, for understandable reasons, has failed to take off: though it was famously pulled into service by JK Rowling for one of her most memorable baddies, the sinister Draco Malfoy. This is not surprising, given that JK studied classics and French at Exeter University and is rumoured to have based Dumbledore on the splendidly bearded Peter Wiseman, Exeter's classics professor emeritus.</p> <p><strong>Ostracise</strong><br>As in, \"I should think you'll be completely ostracised from the golf club, Derek, if you go anywhere near it in those trousers.\"</p> <p>Ostracism was a method by which, through the Athenian democratic reforms introduced by Cleisthenes in 508 or 507 BC, a citizen could be exiled for 10 years after a majority vote in the assembly. The name of the chosen man was written on a shard of pottery, an ostrakon. Nearly 200 ostraka have been found in an Athenian well, with the name Themistocles written on them in a very few hands. Presumably he was at the receiving end of a carefully orchestrated campaign.</p> <p><strong>Odeon</strong><br>As in \"What's on at the Odeon? I quite fancy catching 300 again there. Nothing I like better than a pumped-up Spartan wearing leather knickers.\"</p> <p>The notable cinema chain is named, ultimately, for one of the great buildings on the slopes of the Acropolis, the odeion, or music hall (and in fact, there were odeia in other Greek cities, too). The Athenian odeion was a square hall with pillars supposedly made from the masts of Persian ships taken at the battle of Salamis in the Persian wars. Men and boys' choral competitions, part of the festival called the City Dionysia, were held there, as well as previews of the main tragic plays. Popcorn was not served.</p> <p><strong>Hoi polloi</strong><br>As in, \"Ivy says she can't bear to go shopping on a Saturday. The town centre is just too full of hoi polloi, apparently.\"</p> <p>Hoi polloi is Greek for \"the many\", meaning the ordinary people. Used with more than a soup\u00e7on of snobbery in English. To say \"the hoi polloi\", incidentally, is strictly speaking a gaffe, since it means \"the the many\" as hoi is the definite article.</p> <p><strong>Platonic</strong><br>As in, \"Susie's relationship with David is purely platonic, you realise.\"</p> <p>The sort of admiring, passionate but asexual regard for young men that Socrates engaged in. Alcibiades slept one night under a cloak with Socrates, according to Plato - but, he said, it was just like sleeping with a brother or a father. Socrates just wasn't interested in going all the way. You could see this as a metaphor for his pursuit of knowledge: it's about the quest, not the consummation.</p> <p><strong>Cynical</strong><br>As in, \"I'm fed up with you lot being cynical grouches. Let's bring in a bit of joy, people!\"</p> <p>A philosophical school, or, more accurately, way of life, practised from the fourth century BC. Diogenes, who supposedly lived in a barrel, was the most famous Cynic - the word probably derives from the Greek for dog, so cynicism means \"doggishness\". It seems that adherents tried to live in accordance with nature, seeing animals as exemplars of anxiety-free living, and eschewing ambition, power, material possessions, even education. Diogenes once famously masturbated in the street. Our word \"cynical\" thus takes a bit of leap from its ancient origins.</p> <p><strong>Stoical</strong><br>As in, \"Martha has been tremendously stoical since her house burned down and she lost her job.\"</p> <p>Stoicism, founded in the fourth century BC by Zeno of Citium, was an extremely significant philosophical school. Empiricism and materialism were key features; in the realm of ethics, freeing oneself from emotion and living in accordance with human nature (which for Stoics was indivisible from human reason), was of great importance. Virtue, argued Stoics, was sufficient for happiness.</p> <p><strong>Sceptical</strong><br>As in, \"The government claims it's going to have London ready for the 2012 Olympics, but frankly, I'm sceptical.\"</p> <p>\"Sceptic\" was a label introduced in the first century BC to describe the position of philosophers who held no doctrine and suspended judgment on, well, everything. Particularly lively debates ensued with the materialist Stoics </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 It's All Greek to Me</strong> by Charlotte Higgins is published by Shortbooks, priced \u00a312.99.

  "<p>Sarah Palin is the world's most famous \"hockey mom\" - a big vote-winner with the mothers of some 350,000 American hockey-playing young people. In the UK, though, the term means nothing to most of us. Only a minority of kids play ice hockey. Unfortunately, that now includes my 10-year-old daughter Miranda.</p> <p>To begin with I was rather thrilled with the idea of something so offbeat, and Miranda was bowled over: the ice, the speed, the padded body armour. The helmet with built-in facial cage. The \"pelvic box\" to protect her ovaries from a lethal flying puck. </p> <p>Then the club secretary sidled up. \"It's a big deal, being a hockey mum,\" she said sternly. \"Are you sure you're cut out for it?\" </p> <p>It took a while for the full horror to dawn. First, the cost. The gear has so far set me back at least \u00a3500 and playing fees are \u00a3600 a year. But this is dwarfed by the time and dedication required. Hockey moms, I am assured every week as I stand freezing by the ice for two hours, only exist for their kids' involvement in the sport. Not me, I want to scream: I've got a full-time job and three other children (in fact, Sarah Palin is the only hockey mom I've ever heard of with more kids than me). </p> <p>But ice hockey seems designed to reinforce traditional stereotypes (Palin critics, take note). Each week by the rink I see rows of boys sitting passively while their mothers lace up their boots. When I told Miranda to get her own kit on, I was admonished by another \"mom\" who said I had to tie her boots or she might fall over. When I asked if I could deposit her for Saturday's match and collect her after, I was eyed as some kind of traitor. \"The team needs our support!\" said my fellow hockey mom. \"We've all got to holler!\"</p> <p>Now, Sarah Palin may have the time, the money and the commitment for all this, but I fear it's got me beat. I'm dreaming of the day Miranda decides to quit. Mind you, when I said that to a fellow \"mom\", she laughed. \"The kids who do this, they never give up!\"</p>",
  "<p>On June 11 1982, Lance Corporal Rai - a drummer with the 1st Battalion, 7th Gurkha Rifles - almost lost his life during the final assault on Port Stanley. Seriously injured, he received five pints of blood donated by British soldiers, and the skin that was grafted upon the hole in his back was taken from one of his fallen comrades.</p> <p>Rai retired from the regiment before July 1997 and was refused a visa on the grounds that his application \"failed to demonstrate strong ties to the United Kingdom\".</p> <p>Mr Justice Blake said of Falklands veterans such as himself that it seemed \"curious\" for the Home Office to conclude that the islanders had sufficient connections with the UK to be allowed residence \"but those who risked their lives and limb to bring them their freedom did not\".</p> <p>From his home in Nepal, he said of the judgment: \"I am very very happy. I heard that we had won and I am feeling good. I would like to thank the British people who have helped us. I will apply for my visa because I absolutely want to come to the UK. I have been waiting such a long time. In the course of this legal action, seven of my fellow Gurkha veterans have died waiting and this makes me very sad. I want my visa to be processed very soon.\"</p> <p>Rai still struggles from the pain in his side caused by the artillery and he believes he is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, something for which there is no treatment in his home country. \"I hope that by finally being allowed into the UK I might find some peace, that the doctors will treat me and I will become better,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Human Rights</strong></p> <p>Cherie Booth was heckled yesterday when she defended the Human Rights Act at a fringe meeting. </p> <p>She was given a generally polite reception by the audience. But they expressed their disapproval loudly after she clashed with Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, over the HRA. They were on the panel at a fringe meeting organised by the Sun on \"fixing broken Britain\". </p> <p>\"We need to tear it up and start again,\" Grayling said. Blair said he was being \"specious\". As she tried to say that the HRA was there to protect fundamental rights such as the right to life, some activists heckled her but she went on to defend the act. \"We should be proud that in our country we do not have an elected dictatorship, and that the courts are there to protect individual rights. And, yes, that does apply to the most unpopular people, whether they are criminals, whether they are Gypsies, whether they are illegal asylum seekers, because in the end we are a decent society and we believe that everybody is entitled to respect and that has to be policed on our behalf.\" </p> <p><strong>Development</strong></p> <p>A Conservative government would set up a \u00a340m a year fund to help innovative charities and campaign groups step up the fight against global poverty, the shadow international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, will announce today.</p> <p>In a move designed to illustrate the opposition's commitment to development, Mitchell will say that some of the money spent by the government in fast-growing countries such as China should be reallocated to seedcorn investment in projects struggling for cash. The fund would reward entrepreneurs devising novel ways of reaching the poor.</p> <p>\"We will invite British non-governmental organisations [NGOs] and charities to take the lead,\" Mitchell will say. \"They will come to us with plans to reduce poverty. The money will go to those proposals which are effective, accountable and focused towards clear, measurable outcomes.\"</p> <p>The Department for International Development currently funds a range of NGOs from its \u00a35.6bn budget, but Mitchell believes that the system is too bureaucratic and demand for government support exceeds supply. </p> <p>To balance risk in the portfolio, the so-called Poverty Impact Fund would also support well-established projects with a proven track record of reducing poverty. </p> <p><strong>Sharia courts</strong></p> <p>The Conservatives accused the government yesterday of being \"silent\" on sharia courts, which they said must be given no authority over criminal and family law matters in Britain.</p> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, made the criticism as he warned that the government had neglected the threat of radicalisation. \"For all its tough talk on terrorism, the government is dropping the ball on security and radicalisation,\" Grieve said. \"Lax on fanatical preachers. Silent on sharia courts ... Sharia courts can be given no authority over criminal and family law.\"</p> <p>But Grieve, who told the Guardian last week that multiculturalism had downplayed the identity of \"long-term inhabitants and failed to provide a coherent identity for second and third-generation immigrants\", believes that sharia courts can have a role. He likens them to the Jewish Beth Din - acceptable because their rulings do not conflict with English law.</p>",
  "<p>Vinton Gray \"Vint\" Cerf is a very distinguished, kindly, silver-haired gentleman in a three-piece suit, so perhaps I shouldn't expect him to ride to our rescue with six guns blazing, but I'd settle for a small pearl-handled silver pistol. I want to know who is going to clean up the internet now that it's full of scammers, spammers and criminals running zombie networks, while its connecting pipes are clogged up with porn-to-porn file swapping.</p> <p>Sadly, Cerf doesn't have a silver bullet, either. \"It's every man for himself,\" he says, grinning. \"In the end, it seems every machine has to defend itself. The internet was designed that way.\"</p> <p><strong>Aiming high</strong></p> <p>And he should know. In the early 1970s, Cerf co-designed the TCP/IP protocol suite on which internet communications are based, and was founding president of the Internet Society.</p> <p>He led the team that engineered the first email service to run over the internet; he chaired Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers; and he has been working with Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Interplanetary Internet (<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/vint2\">bit.ly/vint2</a>). It may be a case of \"tomorrow, the stars\", but the here-and-now can seem a bit of a mess.</p> <p>Cerf points out that \"like every medium, the internet can be abused. When we think about it, we can commit fraud locally and internationally using the telephone system and postal service. We can perpetrate a variety of crimes, and in every instance where we have had a technology like that, ultimately society has said: 'There are certain constraints, certain behaviours we will consider to be antisocial. We may not be able to prevent this happening, but we will choose to have consequences if we catch you.' </p> <p>\"This question comes up annually at the internet governance meetings. So I won't be surprised if there are national and international agreements reached about certain unacceptable behaviours on the net, and they will be enforced to one degree or another.\"</p> <p>However, Cerf is also convinced that it's the internet's openness - in allowing people with new ideas to do their thing without getting anyone's permission - that is the main source of its power.</p> <p>\"So I have this almost schizoid hope that we deal with some of the abuses in the net and, at the same time, we don't lose this very open environment, so that information-sharing remains as open as it has been,\" he says.</p> <p>One example is Google, a company that Cerf - now 65 - joined three years ago as Chief Internet Evangelist. \"Google wouldn't exist if Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] hadn't just built this thing and tried it out. The same is true with Jerry [Yang, co-founder] at Yahoo,\" says Cerf.</p> <p>The internet hardly needs an evangelist now. However, it still needs defending, and Cerf has been putting the case for \"net neutrality\" - a hot topic for US politicians, who are being lobbied by the phone companies. </p> <p>\"We're expecting new legislation,\" he says. \"I think there should be very strong measures to prevent anti-competitive actions, so I'm actually very sanguine about the passing of legislation in the United States.\"</p> <p><strong>Traffic cops</strong></p> <p>He says Google's aim is to ensure open communications, which means equally open to different technologies and different types of traffic. However, limiting the amount of traffic each person uses is a different matter. \"As long as you get the capacity you're paying for, that's a form of fairness,\" says Cerf. \"It's orthogonal to net neutrality.\"</p> <p>As the publicly recognised \"father of the internet\" and winner of a Turing and other awards, Cerf also opens doors for Google. Last Wednesday he spent the morning talking at the British Computer Society before visiting the Guardian for a Q&amp;A with a couple of dozen staff over a sandwich lunch. He started out by showing us his dancing programmable Sony MP3 player, Rolly, which shows we can now put computer power wherever we need it, he says. It's really an ice-breaker to show he's not stuffy.</p> <p>Suffice it to say that Cerf doesn't think the net will be brought to its knees either by botnets or spam. \"Spam is a problem, but we can filter it,\" he says, and its demands on capacity are \"small relative to the bits carrying images and video\". As for the zombies, he points out that \"the botnet herders don't want to destroy the internet: they need it to make a living. We may not think it's acceptable, but that's their motivation.\"</p> <p>He also doesn't think the net is going to exhibit any form of consciousness. \"I don't believe we will see grow out of the network the kind of intelligence that sounds like a Fred Hoyle science fiction novel,\" he says. However, \"even if the internet is not intelligent and aware, it will feel more intelligent than it does today. But it's fair to say that if you want the system to do things you care about, you have to let it know what you care about. You have to give up some information voluntarily.\"</p> <p><strong>House of cards</strong></p> <p>Afterwards, over a coffee, I raise the spectre of the \"two-tier internet\" that some companies would like. There could be, for example, a trusted, controlled \"overnet\" for commercial and business use, and an \"undernet\" where anything goes. </p> <p>\"It's probably not wise to design systems that assume that a particular subset is trusted,\" says Cerf. \"I don't mean to say you shouldn't try, but every machine that can be compromised is a potential hazard. A machine that was OK yesterday is certainly not OK today: it may have ingested an infected memory stick. At the very least, you have to keep validating it. My bias right now tends to be 'It's every man for himself' - you need to be suspicious whether you're inside the trusted cloud or not, and when it fails, the house of cards tends to collapse.\"</p> <p>But the continuous validation of known sources is not something for which the internet provides much help. \"The idea of a virtual private network was not part of the original design,\" says Cerf, with a grin. \"It was actually an oversight. It didn't occur to me that it would be useful until afterwards.\"</p> <p>Of course, no one foresaw just how big, or how pervasive, the internet was going to become. In the end, we should probably be grateful the designers opted not for control but for freedom.</p> <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 65</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Graduated Stanford University, 1965, BS in Mathematics; MS in Computer Science, UCLA; PhD in Computer Science, UCLA</p> <p><strong>Career</strong></p> <p><strong>Includes</strong> assistant professor, Stanford University; US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); vice-president, MCI; founding president of the Internet Society; visiting scientist, Nasa; chairman, ICANN; chief internet evangelist, Google</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married to Sigrid; two sons</p>",
  "<p>Tim Fortescue, who has died aged 92, enjoyed a parliamentary interlude in his long career in the food industry and as a colonial civil servant. He was Conservative MP for the marginal seat of Liverpool Garston for two terms from 1966 until 1974. He stepped down just before it was captured by Labour in February 1974, as one of the additional seats which enabled Harold Wilson to enjoy a third term in office.</p> <p>A shrewd and observant man, in 1971 Fortescue learned from constituents about the industrial chaos at Ford's Halewood plant, long before it reached the motor company's top management, and brought it to public attention. But such political sensitivities were largely hidden during his parliamentary stint by the Commons silence imposed on him by his service as an assistant whip (1970-71) and senior whip (1971-73).</p> <p>While an MP, he opposed hanging and was one of 10 Tory MPs to vote against Labour's curb on Commonwealth immigration, a suitable attitude for one formerly in the colonial service. He found more congenial his following decade as the secretary general of the Food and Drinks Industries Council from 1973 to 1983, for which service he was appointed CBE.</p> <p>This later preoccupation with the food industry was not his original intention. Born Trevor Victor Norman Fortescue, in Chingford, Essex, he was educated at Uppingham school, in Rutland, and King's College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages. Graduating in 1938, he opted for the colonial service and was posted to Hong Kong as a magistrate. Imprisoned there by the Japanese invaders between 1941 and 1945, he stayed on until 1947 when he joined the infant Food and Agriculture Organisation in Washington. He then resumed colonial service in Kenya, but returned to the FAO in Rome in 1951.</p> <p>He became chief marketing officer for the Milk Marketing Board of England and Wales in 1954. He then went to work for Nestl\u00e9, first in Switzerland, then London.</p> <p>When he decided on politics, Fortescue found it easy to find his parliamentary seat after Richard Bingham stood down from Garston to become a judge. Fortescue retained the seat with a 3,970 majority in 1966. Initially he took a considerable interest in aviation, becoming secretary of the Tory MPs' aviation committee. After resigning as a whip he took strong exception to Edward Heath's proposal for a Maplin Sands alternative to Heathrow, a proposal now being revived by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Anthea, and a son and daughter of his first marriage.</p> <p>\u2022 Trevor Victor Norman \"Tim\" Fortescue, politician and marketing executive, born August 28 1916; died September 28 2008</p>",
  "<p>Syrian and Lebanese political leaders have traded angry accusations after terrorist bombings in both countries fuelled fears of a new crisis between them.</p> <p>Saad Hariri, leader of the western-backed Sunni Future Movement, lashed out at Bashar al-Assad after the Syrian president warned that northern Lebanon had become \"a base for extremism and constitutes a danger for Syria\".</p> <p>Hariri retorted that it was Syria that was \"a clear and direct threat\" to Lebanon, bluntly accusing Damascus of \"infiltrating extremists to north Lebanon to carry out terrorist attacks targeting the Lebanese army and civilians\". Last week thousands of Syrian troops reportedly gathered on Lebanon's northern border, sparking concerns of a large-scale incursion.</p> <p>Seven Lebanese, including four soldiers, died on Monday in a bus bomb attack in Tripoli, the country's second-largest city. Similar to a bombing in August, it was widely blamed on Fatah al-Islam, an extremist Sunni group the Lebanese military fought last year in a nearby Palestinian refugee camp, Nahr el-Bared. Lebanese sources insisted it has, or had, links to Syrian intelligence.</p> <p>On Saturday, 17 people died in a suicide car bombing near Damascus - Syria's worst terrorist incident in more than 20 years. Officials said it had been carried out by a \"Takfiri\" group - standard terminology for al-Qaida - and hinted that the perpetrators came from Iraq, where the US military \"surge\" has put al-Qaida under pressure. </p> <p>Analysts suggested the Damascus attack may have been an act of retaliation, after the Syrian government, anxious to improve its image in the west, tightened control of its long border with Iraq. The apparent target was a Syrian intelligence office near the Shia shrine of Sayyida Zeynab, where many Iraqi refugees live. </p> <p>Syrian opposition sources have claimed that one of the victims was an intelligence officer, fuelling speculation about whether the bombing was linked to some internal squabble.</p> <p>\"It is possible that there is no connection between the incidents in Tripoli and Damascus,\" said Nadim Shehadi, a Middle East expert at Chatham House in London. \"But the perception in Lebanon is that terrorists who cross the border and blow themselves up are sent from Damascus. And in Syria, they are keen to show that Lebanon cannot function without them and that when they were in charge there they managed to keep a lid on all these terrorist groups.\"</p> <p>Assad's comments have heightened concerns that Syria could have designs on its smaller neighbour. </p> <p>In Beirut, Hariri denounced the deployment of Syrian troops along Lebanon's northern borders. He urged the international community not to allow Syria to intervene in Lebanese affairs under the guise of fighting extremism.</p>",

  "<p>I couldn't pass up the opportunity to stop by my local Starbucks in North Carolina last Saturday to get a tall brew and chat with the group of Obama supporters who use it as their headquarters for weekly neighbourhood canvassing operations.</p> <p>There was a certain sense of foreboding in the air. Rumours of <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/news/companies/wachovia_citigroup/index.htm?postversion=2008092908\">Citibank's takeover of Charlotte-headquartered Wachovia</a> were already rampant, and whenever your home state's flagship bank gets bought up at firesale prices, you just know that <a href=\"http://charlotte.bizjournals.com/charlotte/stories/2008/09/29/daily21.html\">layoffs are imminent</a>, and it makes folks nervous. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">financial debates in Washington</a> had taken on new and suddenly very personal aspect. This wasn't mere politics any more. This was about survival.</p> <p>There were at least seven or eight volunteers congregating outside in the cool autumn morning, and as one pair would leave, canvassing packets in hand, a few more would show up ready to get to work. It was an excellent place to hear these Obamanauts wax rhapsodic about their candidate.</p> <p>For an allegedly fanatical band of supporters blindly following a charismatic leader, they were strangely critical of Obama's performance in Friday's <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=us:g/3-0&amp;fp=48e2a9ea7c54e7ae&amp;ei=kl_iSPi3JaSwQ5fc9PoG&amp;url=http%3A//www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama&amp;cid=1252657626&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRMCzjysjTx0o6-F3qmt9GNtflPQ\">presidential debate</a>. Indeed, over the course of an hour, every single one had virtually pages of criticism about the debate. Obama talked too much about taxes. He didn't talk enough about taxes. He spent too much time on the war and the surge. He didn't hit the war hard enough. He didn't go after McCain enough. He was too sharp on McCain. He showed far too much deference to his opponent. He was far too insolent to his opponent. His answers sounded too polished and practiced. His answers weren't flowing naturally and freely - why didn't he practice more? The consensus was clearly that Obama did OK, but he should have done better \u2013 with each of his supposedly obsessive supporters knowing exactly what he should have said. </p> <p>The impressive thing about the Obama people was their dedication. They were not so much blinded by hope and audacity as they were cynically recalling the last few tainted presidential elections and vowing never again to suffer through something similar. After that, it was \"fill in the blanks\".</p> <p>Each had a particular hot-button issue: immigration, universal healthcare, a return to justice and the rule of law, governmental competence, the wars, the deficit, the defence of science or just an intense desire for revenge on the Bush administration. The Obamanauts were all well versed in policy and ready to make impassioned arguments to any who would listen. Far from being enamoured of their candidate, they were all convinced that Obama wasn't doing nearly enough with policy on X, and if he really wanted to win all he had to do was Y.</p> <p>Few other cultures can project the sense of righteous indignation that an American \"armchair quarterback\" can when it comes to national politics. Despite having obviously planned this for years, built a dynamic and amazingly stable political organisation, pioneering new and innovative strategies and tactics, deftly handled the gruelling two-year-long primary process, and successfully raising record amounts of campaign contributions without overtly selling out to any industry or special interest group, Obama wasn't quite on point for these folks. Even the most stalwart Obama supporter was certain that they, and they alone, knew the secret to convincing a jaded electorate that Obama was the best choice for president. </p> <p>All the volunteers but one, I should say. Just as I was leaving, one of my original <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/03/theobamadads\">Obama Dads</a> arrived. He's an African-American guy just a few years younger than me, but he had a haggard expression as he stumbled toward the promise of coffee and an afternoon of pounding the pavement for Obama. We'd lost touch over the last few months as our other commitments kept us out of active campaigning \u2013 kids will do that to you. But after swapping new Wachovia rumours, I was surprised that he had no complaints about the debate, no blanks that needed to be filled in order to make it the perfect campaign. </p> <p>\"He's kicking butt, and everyone needs to just back off,\" he suggested. \"He knows what he's doing. These guys are just so scared of losing that they don't remember what winning feels like, that's all. Look at McCain at the debate. Remember he's 72 years old. Remember who his running mate is. I'm not worried.\" </p> <p>That raises the question of why he was out here. Offhandedly I mentioned how tired he looked, and he revealed with a weary grin that his wife had given birth to a new baby girl a week ago. </p> <p>I was shocked. A week-old newborn, and one kid already destroying the house, and he was spending valuable sleeping time on a pretty Saturday volunteering to talk to occasionally grumpy strangers in a predominantly white neighbourhood about the election. I was mystified, and said as much.</p> <p>He didn't hesitate to show me a picture of the new kid on his phone \u2013 a pretty baby, for the record, as far as newborns go. And she had beautiful big brown eyes that were copied straight from her mama. How could he leave an adorable face like that for this? \"It's because I have a week-old baby girl that I'm volunteering,\" he explained earnestly. \"There's too much at stake to depend on other folks to do it. She's my responsibility, so this is my job.\" His voice was strong, if weary, and utterly resolute. Just the kind of thing you want in a volunteer.</p>",

  "<p>Ministers like nothing more than playing to the gallery by praising the courage of our armed forces.

It was graphically illustrated by a high court judge who, in a damning ruling on Tuesday, <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ghX5g8b-2F_Y2ihEssSr59KwEUTw\">condemned as unlawful </a> the way Gurkha veterans had been treated, specifically the way they have been refused the right to settle in Britain if they retired before 1997.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2786991.stm\">Gurkhas</a> may have fought and risked their lives for Britain in every single armed conflict since the second world war, yet they had failed to demonstrate they had \"strong ties\" to Britain.</p> <p>So argued the Home Office with the full backing of the Ministry of Defence. The 1997 cut-off date was decided on the spurious grounds that before that date Hong Kong was the Gurkhas' base. After the former colony was handed back to China, the UK became their base.</p> <p>For more than 60 years, the Gurkhas have formed a brigade of the British army. the number of veterans prevented from settling here amount to about 2,000.</p> <p>Mr Justice Blake noted that when the government imposed the 1997 cut-off date, Tony Blair, then prime minister, had stated:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Gurkhas have served this country with great skill, courage and dignity ... They have made an enormous contribution not just to our armed forces but to the life of ths country ... </p> </blockquote> <p>David Blunkett, the home secretary, said he was keen to ensure we recognised \"their role in the history of our country and the part they played in protecting us\". The 13 VCs and many other bravery awards spoke for themselves, Blunkett added.</p> <p>The judge noted how after the invasion of the Falklands by Argentina and the subsequent conflict, nationality laws were amended and the islanders were entitled to become full British citizens. He continued, referring to the role of the Gurkhas in the Falklands war:</p> <blockquote> <p>It would be curious if the Home Office had concluded that the islanders themselves who may have stayed put for many years were regarded as having a close enough connection with the United Kingdom but those who risked their lives and limb to bring them their freedom did not. This would seem to irrationally subvert the historic debt that the prime minister and the home secretary spoke of.</p> </blockquote> <p>One of the reasons why the Gurkha vets were deemed to have insufficiently strong ties with the UK was that, unlike British army soldiers from Commonwealth countries who are generally given indefinite leave to remain here, Gurkhas were discharged in Nepal, their country of origin. Geoff Hoon, the former defence secretary, claimed this was demanded by the Nepalese government. That assertion, said Blake, was misleading. And it was \"plain wrong\" to suggest, as ministers had done, that Nepal was opposed to Gurkha vets settling in Britain.</p> <p>The judge exposed what he called the lack of clarity and consistency in the way ministers applied their immigration policy and used their power of discretion. He might have used much stronger language. And the struggle is not over yet. It may not be necessary to \"quash the policy itself\", he said, just the way it was applied. But it is not only a question of lawfully applying a policy. \"Moral debt\", as Blake himself suggested, comes into it too.</p>",

  "<p>The son of former Liberian president Charles Taylor ran a security force in his father's government with a brutal agenda marked by the beating, burning and beheading of people opposed to his rule, a federal prosecutor said Monday during a landmark torture trial in Miami.</p> <p>Charles \"Chuckie\" Taylor Jr, born in Boston and raised in Orlando, Florida, was tapped by his father to command an anti-terrorist unit called the Demon Forces that cut a man's penis with a sharp knife before dumping him in a dirt pit, Justice Department prosecutor Christopher Graveline said in opening statements.</p> <p>\"You will hear witness after witness tell about the fear they felt when they heard that name,\" Graveline said, referring to the nickname, \"Chuckie,\" that Taylor went by in Liberia from 1999 to 2003 when he served as a security-force boss.</p> <p>The Miami criminal case - taking place at the same time the father<br>faces a war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands - marks the first US prosecution of torture committed in a foreign country. Taylor, a 31-year-old U.S. citizen, is charged with conspiracy, torture and carrying a firearm during a violent crime.</p> <p>Taylor's court-appointed defence attorney depicted his client as an innocent man who helped protect his father's government against rebels seeking to overthrow it.</p> <p>The defence argued that witnesses wrongly accused Taylor of torture in an attempt to get out of the impoverished, violent African nation.</p> <p>Assistant Federal Public Defender John Wiley said if this case were a newspaper headline it would read: \"Desperate and disgruntled Africans accuse American to escape war-torn Liberia.\"<br>He said some are seeking protected status such as asylum in the United States in exchange for their testimony against Taylor.<br>If convicted of the horrific allegations - burning victims' flesh with molten plastic, shocking their genitals with an electrical prod, ordering the beheading of one victim with a knife - Taylor would spend the rest of his life in prison.</p> <p>Taylor was charged under a 1994 law that permits the federal government to prosecute anyone suspected of carrying out torture outside the United States as long as the suspect is a US citizen, legal resident or is present in this country, regardless of nationality.<br>He was arrested on false passport charges when he arrived in Miami from Trinidad in March 2006.</p> <p>Taylor's goal in the alleged conspiracy was to \"strengthen the power and authority\" of his father's presidency and to \"eliminate actual and perceived opponents and threats to his administration by means of torture,\" according to the indictment.</p> <p>The indictment accuses him of using Liberia's antiterrorist unit to seize, imprison, interrogate and mistreat those opposed to his father's government \"by acts specifically intended to inflict severe physical pain and suffering\".</p> <p>The Taylor trial is expected to last up to eight weeks, said district judge Cecilia Altonaga. Prosecutors will call government agents as well some of the seven alleged victims cited in the indictment.<br>Taylor's attorneys also plan to put on a defence, saying they will call witnesses to testify he did not commit any acts of torture.<br></p>",
  "<p>Sometimes what makes a foreign band successful in Japan is not simply the qualities that made them stars elsewhere, but the way in which they reappropriate aspects of Japanese culture. It shows that, not only does the spirit of the nation influence them, but if they wanted to, they could give everything up and embrace life in Japan. This cultural exchange can often be subtle, such as when bands issue Japanese translations of their lyrics with album sleeve notes. On other occasions, however, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=jb32d3xr2Us\">the attempt at crossing over is a little more blatant</a>.</p> <p>But don't knock it \u2013 it's certainly an improvement on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merry_Christmas,_Mr._Lawrence\">Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence</a>. Anyway, somewhere in between those two benchmarks of sleeve notes and Scat Ultraman are Weezer, who played a huge gig in a warehouse at Osaka port last weekend. The event was billed as \"The Weezer Festival\", perhaps a little optimistic seeing as there was precisely nothing to distinguish it from a standard gig. Supported by ace Japanese indie icons Asian Kung-Fu Generation, Cuomo &amp; co played a show as alien to audiences back home as a decent tune is to the Courteeners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338131095\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2008/09/30/rivers.jpg\" alt=\"Turning Japanese: Rivers Cuomo\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rivers Cuomo from Weezer.

Things got stranger when he then led the crowd through a sing-a-long of, er, various Japanese nursery rhymes. The girl next to me (a trucker from Nagoya recently fired for drinking on the job) told me enthusiastically, \"This is why Japan loves Rivers,\" and it seems Rivers loves Japan too. He has a Japanese wife, Kyoko Ito, who he met when she came to see one of his early solo gigs in 1997. </p> <p>He spoke to the crowd with an admirable proficiency in their native tongue, and even indulged in the peculiar aspect of Japanese pop performances where the artist in question takes a break from playing songs to have an informal, one-way discussion with the crowd. On this occasion we learned that Rivers had recently been to a Japanese onsen (natural spring bath) and that he enjoyed it \u2013 a mind-blowing revelation that left much of the crowd gasping with joy that any foreigner could ever make sense of what they perceive to be incomprehensible to anyone living outside their culture.</p> <p>Another band to have been caught on the crest of a great wave off Kanagawa are Hadouken!

  "<p>Cherie Blair was heckled today when she defended the Human Rights Act at a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference.</p> <p>In her first visit to a Tory event, the former prime minister's wife angered members of the audience when she criticised a member of the shadow cabinet who said that the Human Rights Act should be ripped up.</p> <p>Blair spoke out as she appeared on a panel at a fringe meeting organised by the Sun newspaper to discuss \"fixing broken Britain\". </p> <p>She appeared alongside the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, former home secretary Charles Clarke, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Chris Grayling, and former New York police chief Bill Bratton.</p> <p>During the session Clarke also criticised the government's plans to build three giant so-called Titan prisons, and Bratton, a champion of the \"broken windows\" theory of policing that was credited with cutting crime drastically in New York, said that officers in Britain were being \"crushed\" by Whitehall targets.</p> <p>Blair, who was invited because she recently chaired a commission for Channel 4 on street weapons and who appeared under her married name, was generally given a polite reception by the members of the audience. But they expressed their disapproval loudly after she clashed with Grayling over the HRA.</p> <p>\"The evidence of the past 10 years is that the Human Rights Act has not worked \u2026 We need to tear it up and start again and come up with something that works with the reality of this country,\" Grayling said.</p> <p>Blair said he was being \"specious\". As she tried to say that the HRA was there to protect fundamental rights such as the right to life, some activists heckled her loudly with remarks like \"Please\" and \"We're not saying that\".</p> <p>At one point Paul Bowman, whose daughter Sally Anne was stabbed to death, and who was one of several parents of murder victims speaking at the event, said he thought the HRA should not apply to people like the man who murdered his daughter.</p> <p>And later Terry Bosshard, an activist from Bromley and Chislehurst, claimed that Blair had been instrumental in Labour's decision to pass the act.</p> <p>Blair replied: \"I don't think I can claim any responsibility for bringing in the Human Rights Act.\" But she went on to defend it robustly, saying that it had entrenched rights that had been part of British common law for generations.</p> <p>\"Human rights are always about rights and responsibilities. They are about respect for individuals, so that each individual has the right to be respected,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We should be proud that in our country we do not have an elected dictatorship, and that the courts are there to protect individual rights.</p> <p>\"And, yes, that does apply to the most unpopular people, whether they are criminals, whether they are gypsies, whether they are illegal asylum seekers, because in the end we are a decent society and we believe that everybody is entitled to respect and that has to be policed on our behalf.\"</p> <p>During the debate Jonathan Aitken, the former Tory cabinet minister who was jailed for committing perjury during a libel case against the Guardian, and who was in yesterday's audience, said he was concerned that Labour's plans to build Titan prisons would make it harder for prisoners to be rehabilitated. </p> <p>He said the prisons would be situated \"nowhere near\" the communities where the rehabilitation work had to take place.</p> <p>Clarke replied: \"I'm amazed to say that I agree with Jonathan. I made a speech when I was home secretary arguing strongly for community-based prisons.\"</p> <p>And Bratton, who is now head of the police department in Los Angeles, said he thought there were too many national targets for police officers in the UK</p> <p>\"The national influence on your police is crushing in terms of all of the layers of accountability and goals,\" he said.</p> <p>He said that on a visit to the Tower of London he had seen how \"pressure plates\" used to be used as an instrument of torture. Bratton suggested the national targets were having the same effect as \"pressure plates\" on British police officers.</p>",
  "<p>Bullet points just don't work. We've all chewed our fists in frustration as the 150th bullet appears in a presentation. We've all felt our hearts sink when faced with another report crammed with black dots. Bullets don't impress people; they depress people. </p> <p>Are bullet points really to blame, though?

They don't: they are themselves dull text. </p> <p>This all leads to bad decisions.

  "<p>Gurkha veterans who were refused visas to settle in the United Kingdom because they retired from the regiment before 1997 were treated unlawfully and the policy used to reject them was misleading, a high court judge said today. </p> <p>In a damning ruling for the Ministry of Defence, Mr Justice Blake said its advice to the Home Office on whether to grant settlement to the Gurkhas was confusing, resulting in \"irrational and unlawful\" restrictions being applied. </p> <p>The policy needed \"urgent revisiting\", he said, setting a deadline of three months. The Home Office, he added, should \"take political responsibility for the outcome where it is answerable to the electorate\". He ordered the Home Office to pay 80% of the costs of the case. </p> <p>Today's ruling could open the door to more than 2,000 Gurkhas who have had their visas rejected under the misleading policy.</p> <p>Citing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/30/military.immigration1\">historic military covenant</a> \u2013 which provides UK armed forces and their families with proper care, in return for asking them to risk making \"the ultimate sacrifice for their country\" \u2013 the judge said: \"Rewarding long and distinguished service by the grant of residence in this country for whom the service was performed would be a vindication and an enhancement of this covenant.\"</p> <p>Five Gurkha veterans and a regimental widow sought a judicial review of the refusal to grant them entry visas on the grounds that they had \"no strong ties\" to the UK.</p> <p>Entry clearance officers working for the British embassy in Nepal rejected the Gurkhas through what the judge said was an ambiguous policy that \"irrationally excluded material and potentially decisive considerations that the context and the stated purpose of the policy indicates should have been included\". </p> <p>The law was \"so unclear as to permit conflicting decisions\". It failed to take into account years served, whether injuries were inflicted and whether medals of valour \u2013 including the Victoria Cross \u2013 were won.</p> <p>The government argued that since the Gurkhas' regimental headquarters were in Hong Kong until 1997, the soldiers did not develop close enough ties to the UK.</p> <p>Hundreds of ex-Gurkhas gathered outside the high court to await the ruling, along with the actor Joanna Lumley, whose father served with the Brigade of Gurkhas for 30 years. </p> <p>Mr Justice Blake's ruling condemned the basis of the policy that excluded the Gurkhas. \"Transparency and clarity are significant requirements of instructions to immigration and entry clearance officers that are published to the world at large, generate expectations of fair treatment and bind appellate bodies in the performance of their statutory functions,\" he said.</p> <p>The government's policy either \"irrationally excluded material and potentially decisive considerations\" or else was so ambiguous as to be misleading for both applicants and immigration officials.</p> <p>He compared the Gurkhas' situation to that of Commonwealth soldiers, who are automatically allowed to stay in the UK after four years' service. </p> <p>Another \"inconsistency\" was the failure of Gurkha veterans of the Falklands war to obtain visas, he said, contrasting this with the government's treatment of Falkland islanders. It seemed \"curious\" for the Home Office to conclude that the islanders were sufficiently connected with the UK to be allowed residence \"but those who risked their lives and limb to bring them their freedom did not\".</p> <p>Last year, a government review allowed Gurkhas to apply to settle under a policy known as the Armed Forces Concession, which gives a soldier serving with the British army the right to settle in Britain after four years of service anywhere in the world. For Gurkhas alone, the policy drew a line in the sand at July 1, 1997. </p> <p>Mr Justice Blake questioned why the witnesses for the government were from the MoD, yet the MoD had submitted to the courts that the policy was \"outside the province of that department\". </p> <p>The MoD wrongly advised the Home Office that the Nepali government did not want its nationals who had become Gurkhas discharged in the UK but instead wanted them returned to Nepal. The court was told this had never been the case.</p> <p>The Gurkhas were not, however, discriminated against on grounds of race, a claim that the judge ruled to be \"wholly unfounded\".</p> <p>Greeting the ruling on the court steps, Martin Howe, the human rights lawyer representing the Gurkhas, called the ruling \"a tremendous and historic victory\".</p> <p>\"It is a victory for common sense; a victory for fairness; and a victory for the British sense of what is 'right',\" he said. \"My clients, and the thousands of Gurkhas standing behind them, ask for nothing more from this country than the unfettered right to live amongst the British people - a people they have protected and loved throughout years of long and loyal service to the crown.\"</p> <p>Lumley said the judgment had given the government the \"chance to right great wrongs and wipe out a national stain\" and vowed the campaign would continue until the policy was rewritten.</p>",

  "<p>Part of the charm of New York is its only partly tongue-in-cheek reluctance to grant that anyone else does anything better. Beaches? Yeah, the Caribbean's got that whole luxury thing down but really the Hamptons are more convenient. Tacos? Sure, they're pretty good in Mexico but have you tried that place at 49th and 10th? Studio movies? Well, yeah, Los Angeles is where it's at now but between the wars all the killer action was right here ...</p> <p>The last is the intriguing premise of Hollywood on the Hudson, a month-long season of movies playing at the Museum of Modern Art. It's partly curated by Richard Koszarski, from whose scholarly study it takes its name and argument: that in the 1920s and 1930s, the relatively independent-minded film-makers operating on the east coast set the template for the development of the film industry by focusing on technical innovation and niche audiences, rather than the one-size-fits-all grandiosity that the California studios developed and had to wean themselves off after world war one.</p> <p>Book-ended by DW Griffith's return from Los Angeles to New York in 1919 and the World's Fair two decades later, the season includes work from the likes of Louise Brooks, Rudolph Valentino and the Marx Brothers, as well as little-seen pictures touching on the Jewish and African-American experience of the city. As well as material filmed on sound stages in the area, there's some fascinating location work that documents New York at a time of remarkable upheaval. Not that this location work suggests any movement towards documentary realism. At times, the conflation of realism and melodrama yields peculiar, borderline surreal results.</p> <p>A case in point is the silent portmanteau feature While New York Sleeps (1920), which screened at the weekend with live piano accompaniment. Directed by Charles Brabin \u2013 the Liverpool-born filmmaker who married the silent-screen siren Theda Bara \u2013 its three stories of criminality span the social spectrum of \"the great metropolis, New York\", and a variety of formal approaches, while retaining cohesion through its use of the same actors as each story's leads and some consistent moral lessons (such as, er, women are deceitful hussies).</p> <p>The opener is set in a swanky pile in \"the suburbs\", where wifey has no sooner bid hubby farewell than she suffers not one but two house invasions - from a pantomime burglar and, more disquietingly, from her feckless first husband, whom she presumed dead. Not even wealth can protect you from the past, we learn \u2013 though a revolver helps. \"The supple forms of women\" are directly blamed for the confidence trickery of the second story, set on the \"Gay White Way\" of the city's after-dark hotspots. It makes much of its New York setting \u2013 the con artists earned a laugh by announcing their next stop would be \"Brooklyn. It's full of respectable businessmen\" \u2013 but like the first story, it's mainly composed of interiors.</p> <p>The final and most interesting part, however, does use location work. The setting is the impoverished Lower East Side, \"where civilization's veneer is thinnest.\" (Plus \u00e7a change ...) An orphaned young woman loses her job at a garment factory and agrees to marry the nightwatchman whose paralytic father she already tends for a few dollars a week. Disdaining his gentleness, she falls for a gangster who takes refuge in their hovel after robbing the dock where her husband works. The plot is informed by a kind of social realism \u2013 both the factory and home sequences offer a glimpse of life for the working poor \u2013 and animated by some exciting location footage shot on and around the river, with the Manhattan Bridge looming overhead. Yet there's exploitation here too, in the form of catfights and shoot-outs, and melodrama in the sentimental plot.</p> <p>At the same time, however, there are arresting flashes of the expressionist and the surreal. The gangster invades the home via a peculiar trap door in the middle of the room, emerging from the floor, caked with mud. And the old man's situation is fascinating: immobile and unable to communicate except with his eyes, he is at once a stand-in for the helpless audience and the epitome of the silent screen actor. (There's proof here that it is possible to blink histrionically.) If cockiness is one quintessential characteristic of the city, another is the embrace of variety. In its strange, mixed-up way, While New York Sleeps exemplifies that urge.</p>",
  "<p>The New Year break is one of the busiest of the year for holiday cottage lets, with prime properties getting booked up months, or even years, in advance.

An Edinburgh flat </h2> <p>Edinburgh's Hogmanay is one of world's best New Year's Eve street parties, all noise and colour, live music and theatre, lots of singing, serious drinking and a dazzling display of pyrotechnics that lights up the sky behind the castle. Attracting an international crowd of up to 100,000 people, demand for accommodation is high, but Clean Air Cottages have this Marchmont apartment still available. On the first floor of a traditional Victorian house, the flat has stripped wood floors, a generous kitchen and room for four in two bedrooms (one double, one twin).

Set in 26 acres on the River Swale, it's only two miles to Richmond, with its medieval castle and Georgian theatre, and the magnificent ruins of Easby Abbey are just down the road.

Back in the days before we realised that supermarkets were a notch below paedophile vicars and sub-contract car-clampers in the right-thinking person's pantheon of loathing, I used to head to my local Sainsbury's (Camden Town - 8 aisles of crisps, two of fizzy drinks and enough florid nutters to populate a Restoration asylum) to 'pick up a few bits and pieces'. Four hours later I'd return with a thousand-yard stare and enough supplies for a family of eight to survive an ice-age. They say you should never shop for food when you're hungry - I'm not allowed without a responsible grown-up - for which, conveniently, read 'the Baker'.</p> <p>By aisle two I'm wall-eyed with consumer lust \u2026</p> <p>\"Look! <a href=\"http://www.dorsetcereals.co.uk/\">Dorset Cereals Fruit Nut and Seed muesli</a>\"</p> <p>\"You hate muesli. You think it tastes like dry pet food\"</p> <p>\"Look! It's got a beautifully designed box in matt finished inks and reassuring words about sustainability and huge raisins \"</p> <p>\"It's a trap. It's hamster bedding in a yuppie-bait wrapper. Step away from the <a href=\"http://www.nu-era.com/gondola-end-units.asp\">gondola-end</a>\"</p> <p>As I rock backwards and forwards, crooning to myself and stroking the box, the Baker's voice rings out, commanding, metallic and oddly reminiscent of the <a href=\"http://www.crocopuffs.com/soundboard/arnold.html\">Governor of California</a>.</p> <p>\"This is not the food we are looking for.\" Powerful hydraulics swivel the Baker's head. A state-of-the-art target acquisition system locates three 20kg sacks of flour and a dented tin of haricots on the clearance shelf and in a blur of motion I find my limp body deposited beside the car.</p> <p>Using preternatural focus to elude the siren song of marketing, the Baker has successfully collected what we need and by a complex system of interlocking reductions, offers, clipped coupons and full-contact negotiation, has persuaded the manager to personally deliver it to our kitchen and pay us a small fee for the privilege.</p> <p>Do you shop with iron resolve or are you too pusillanimous when faced with premium products?</p>",
  "<p>The UK is finally to remove its remaining two opt-outs to the UN convention on the rights of the child. This should give much-needed protection to thousands of children in contact with UK immigration officials, and to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/almost-3000-children-now-held-in-custody-811779.html\">children held in custody</a> \u2013 but only if ministers reverse harmful policy.</p> <p>Last year over 7,000 children applied for <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration-asylum-stats.html\">asylum</a> in the UK; nearly half had no parent or guardian with them.</p> <p>Children in immigration detention (about 2,000 each year) are made to feel like criminals \u2013 dawn raids, long journeys in caged vans, roll counts, and watching their distraught parents being handcuffed and forced onto aeroplanes. When the chief inspector of prisons asked what would make life better, detained children said they would like to go swimming and to return to their schools. </p> <p>Jacqui Smith says the removal of the reservation shows the government's \"commitment to treat children in the UK immigration system with compassion\". Human rights also require respect for each person's human dignity and fair treatment. Current policy fails these tests. </p> <p>The UN committee on the rights of the child asked civil servants in Geneva last week to explain why children who arrive in the UK alone and vulnerable are not given a guardian, to account for differences in care and education and to explain why children can be prosecuted for not having the right documents. Challenging questions, because the convention obliges governments to always give priority to children's best interests and to protect all children all of the time. </p> <p>The other reservation permits the state to hold children in custody with adults. Its removal should mean an absolute prohibition on girls mixing with women in prison and the end of children in the armed forces who breach military law being imprisoned with adults. </p> <p>The government's announcement does not on its own signal that the UK now fully complies with the convention. The broader treatment of children in the criminal justice system was heavily criticised by the UN committee last week, including the very low age of criminal responsibility, child deaths in custody and the deliberate use of painful restraint. </p> <p>After years of neglect, the removal of the reservations could be a sign that things are changing at last. The UN committee publishes its full analysis and recommendations on Friday. Ministers and civil servants must use this as a blueprint for action. And they should be sure of the public's full support.</p>"
