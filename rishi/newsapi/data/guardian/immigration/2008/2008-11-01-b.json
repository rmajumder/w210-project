  "<p>October was a month that creaked and cracked. The insurance industry, already deeply implicated in the international financial crash, was battered by the fall-out from <a href=\"http://hurricanegustav.wordpress.com/2008/09/30/fast-facts-hurricanes-ike-and-gustav-92908-2/\">hurricanes Ike and Gustav</a>. Their bill is estimated to be around $30bn (\u00a318.2bn), far higher than predicted, according to Lloyd's of London. To show that God has a dark - you could call it \"carbon black\" - sense of humour, in the same month the oil giant <a href=\" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7694508.stm\">BP's quarterly profits</a> of \u00a36.4bn cracked another record high, while Shell's rose to \u00a36.6bn.</p> <p>The sky creaked in another way too. Relentless coverage of global warming, a deluge of green corporate claims, legislative flurries and a redesign of government departments should suggest progress on climate change. But the figures tell another, worrying tale. Far from going down, the global growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions is spiking upwards. Findings from the <a href=\"http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/\">Global Carbon Project</a> this month showed that the global average percentage rise since the year 2000 is now over three times higher than the previous decade, rising again significantly in the last year. These growth rates are now worse than the worse case scenario used by the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) to model potential global warming. Levels of carbon in the energy mix for both rich and poor countries are also going up.</p> <p>Government confusion here in Britain was captured by two stories. In one, Ed Miliband, new minister at the new <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\">Department for Energy and Climate Change</a>, announced the government's commitment to cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. In the other, the <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23573710-details/Pollution+curbs+delayed+to+let+Heathrow+expand/article.do\">Evening Standard</a> reported that \"ministers are planning to water down EU pollution curbs in order to allow Heathrow airport to expand\". Attempts at satire prove redundant. And the heat on the government over Heathrow is rising.</p> <p>It was a victory, but not a straightforward one when, after relentless pressure, the government announced that greenhouse gas emissions from aviation and shipping would finally be included in targets for the <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7040/7040.pdf\">climate change bill</a>. The quirk comes from the fact that not all emissions are the same. It is unclear whether the government has understood that the full global warming impact of emissions from aviation can be up to five times greater than their headline carbon figure. Because of the particular chemistry of emissions from planes, and where and how they enter the atmosphere, tonne-for-tonne of carbon, aviation emissions are far more damaging than those from road, rail or sea.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the international system, however, there were glimmers of bolder visions. The <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/\">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP) announced a new green economics initiative. It adopted the moniker of a \"green new deal\", echoing the report of the same name published in July. At the UNEP launch the head of UNEP, Achim Steiner, lambasted what he called the \"totally inadequate\" response of public policy both to climate change and a range of other ecological crises. The environment secretary Hillary Benn, sitting to his right, just about managed to keep a straight face. </p> <p>Last month saw another more literal cracking, of sea ice. According to research from the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at University College London, in some areas Arctic sea ice was up to <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2008/56-seaice.asp\">one fifth thinner</a> than usual for the time of year. </p> <p>It's now 19 years since the Berlin wall came down, drawing the line under the old Eastern bloc. For all its brashness, triumphalism and smug self-satisfaction, finance-driven capitalism has managed to reign supreme for fewer than two decades before falling apart. </p> <p>No one is more synonymous with the era of financial liberalisation than Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve. Under cross-examination by the US House oversight committee his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/24/economics-creditcrunch-federal-reserve-greenspan\">words</a> were heavy with the pathos of shattered illusion and hubris brought to earth, \"I discovered a flaw,\" he said, \"in the model that I perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works.\"</p> <p>But in the aftermath, in Britain and the US, there are intriguing possibilities. Following nationalisation of much of the finance sector, two governments formerly wedded to light touch, or even absent regulation, find themselves owning, in effect, great swathes of their countries' economies \u2013 banks, homes, buildings, infrastructure and much else besides. Gordon Brown said that now is a time of new and innovative thinking. He is now in a direct position to influence the investment policies and revolutionise the energy use and efficiency of much the economy. </p> <p>It may be that governments still entangled in the habitual rhetoric of free markets, are embarrassed by their new, unaccustomed role. It could be that, having outsourced the exercising of power to the market place, they feel unpractised and not sure what to do. But the climate clock is still ticking \u2013 even speeding up. And, they now have an enormous opportunity to do what democratically elected governments are meant to do \u2013 take responsibility and protect their people from disaster.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Simms is taking the global temperature each month as he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\">counts down</a> the 97 months before the world enters a new, far more perilous phase of global warming.</p>",
  "<p>Regular readers have seen me cite Zack Roth's fine work at TPM before, and today he delivers <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/the_anatomy_of_a_smear.php\">a strong anatomy</a> of the roll-out of the Obama's auntie story. Here's me quoting Zack who in turns quotes the AP and then returns to the narration starting with \"In other words::</p> <blockquote> <p>But note the way in which AP seems to have obtained the information. High up in the story, it reports: </p> <p>Information about the deportation case was disclosed and confirmed by two separate sources, one a federal law enforcement official. The information they made available is known to officials in the federal government, but the AP could not establish whether anyone at a political level in the Bush administration or in the McCain campaign had been involved in its release.</p> <p>In other words, it looks like someone in the Bush administration leaked the information, with the goal of throwing a last-minute wrench into Obama's campaign. And someone else confirmed it, with similar motives.</p> <p>On the record, of course, the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, a unit of the Department of Homeland Security, is telling reporters it can't comment on any individual person's immigration status. It would appear to be a violation of department procedures, at the least, to leak such information.</p> </blockquote> <p>We'll probably never know. In the meantime, is this a big story -- the aunt's illegal status, I mean? Could make a difference of a point or two in a small number of states, I think, but in broad terms, it's no October (or November) Surprise. Which raises the broader question of why hasn't the swift-boating of Obama -- you know, the swift-boat equivalents of Ayers and Khalidi and so on -- worked its magic for the GOP the way it has in the past? This is the subject of my print column for Monday's paper. I'm sure you just can't wait!<br></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidmiliband\">David Miliband</a> today said he had held a \"good meeting\" with the president of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congo\">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> during an emergency visit to the war-torn country.</p> <p>The foreign secretary and his French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, met Joseph Kabila for about an hour and a half in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa.</p> <p>The two were due to continue on to the eastern town of Goma on the Rwandan border, where a ceasefire continued to hold after violence earlier this week. Later, they will travel to the Rwandan capital, Kigali, for talks with the country's leader, Paul Kagame.</p> <p>\"We had a good meeting ... The key theme of our discussion has been the need to implement the agreements that have already been made,\" Miliband said after the meeting, according to the AFP news agency.</p> <p>\"Around the world, people are seeing the makings of a humanitarian crisis and it's vital that politics is used to reverse a further round of deaths and killings.\"</p> <p>In Goma, tension remained high amid a fragile ceasefire as Tutsi rebel troops led by General Laurent Nkunda laid siege at the doorstep of the capital of Nord Kivu province.</p> <p>Government forces abandoned Goma on Wednesday as the rebels advanced, leaving just 850 United Nations peacekeepers between Nkunda's forces and Goma.</p> <p>Miliband and Kouchner arrived in Congo as Gordon Brown, the prime minister, spoke of his fears of a developing humanitarian disaster in the region.</p> <p>\"My worry is about the thousands of people being displaced at the moment by the violence that is taking place,\" Brown said.</p> <p>Aid agencies and the UN have warned of impending disaster for thousands of people caught up in the fighting between the Congolese army and the rebel force, which is backed by neighbouring Rwanda's Tutsi leadership.</p> <p>The UN refugee agency said it had received credible reports that rebels had looted and burned camps for displaced people. \"We are extremely concerned about the fate of some 50,000 displaced people living in these camps, which include the UNHCR-administered sites of Dumez, Nyongera and Kasasa,\" the spokesman Ron Redmond said.</p> <p>An estimated 1 million people have been forced from their homes in North Kivu, a province of 5 million that borders Rwanda, after two years of violence. The former Belgian colony, which is rich in copper, cobalt, gold and diamonds, was at war from 1998 until 2003. Around 220,000 people have been displaced since the latest round fighting broke out in August.</p> <p>Referring to the Goma peace accord reached in January this year, Kouchner said today: \"We do not have to redefine the peace protocol ... That has already been done.\"</p> <p>Under the agreement, which has not been implemented, a ceasefire would be enforced and all armed groups in the region would be disarmed.</p> <p>The junior foreign minister, Lord Malloch Brown, said today that Britain might need to send troops to the area if talks failed. He said the UK and other European powers could not stand back if the fighting between government and rebel forces erupted again.</p> <p>\"We have certainly got to have it [a British force] as an option which is developed and on the table if we need it,\" he told the BBC. He, however, stressed that the deployment of EU troops was a last option if all else failed.</p> <p>Charities have warned that unless supplies reach refugees hundreds could be at risk of dying of starvation and disease. Save the Children said today that a team, including health and nutrition experts, was back in Goma after being withdrawn earlier this week and was making an emergency assessment of the needs of the displaced there.</p> <p>\"The ceasefire around Goma seems to be holding and we are taking advantage of the precarious lull in the fighting to attempt to assess the situation so that we can target those in need with emergency feeding and clean water. We need to find out who is where and in what numbers so that we can help them,\" said the spokesman Dominic Nutt.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Will it be D, disastrous?</p> <p>Will our contestants find it I, impossible?</p> <p>Will this be a night that is S, super-special?</p> <p>Will Brian Friedman's creative direction be C, crazy-crazy?</p> <p>Oh-oh-OH! Yes, readers, it's Disco Night on The X Factor, and I shall be taking you through every sequin, every key change, every hyperboled judge's comment, right to the bitter, bitter end.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>7pm:</strong> 30 minutes to go until the rocket that is Disco Night lifts off. It's set to be a classic, so those of you who haven't looked at the song choices, post your predictions in the comments box below!</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7.30pm:</strong> Last week! On The X Factor! The competition was apparently HOTTER than ever before! Simon Cowell's cunning publicity-grabbing ploy of releasing a charidee single worked! Gordon Brown has nothing more important to do than muse over the media! It's TIME! TO FACE! THE MUSIC!</p> <p>I feel vaguely sick.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>7.35pm: </strong>Here is Dermot, to the strains of That's The Way (I Like It). He misuses the word \"literally\" (\"It's literally murder on the dancefloor\") - unless of course he does mean that the bad acts will be shot on stage. Here are the judges, to the strains of YMCA. Louis looks happy. Dannii's skirt is very short. Cheryl is wearing a curtain.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>7.36pm: </strong>More blah about the charidee single and Simon Cowell's new best friend, the prime minister. Dermot promises us an \"incredible\" show, with Will Young performing later on. We're finally ready for the first act - Rachel. Dannii reckons she \"really arrived\" last week; Rachel witters about going to the Bond film premiere - \"it was really 'citing!\" She has a taste for the limelight now, and wants to win. She is starstruck by meeting Will Young, who thinks she is wonderful. I am a little puzzled by him doing disco masterclasses, but presumably his knowledge of the genre is taken for granted for obvious reasons.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>7.39pm: </strong>Rachel is singing Lost in Music. She forgets to sing the first line. But this does not matter, because the backing singers are covering it. And then she forgets to sing the first line of the verse, which is slightly more exposed. Also exposed? The dancers. We have one Sally Bowles, two of the Scissor Sisters, Angel from William Baker's dreadful production of Rent:Remixed, and some other randoms. Oh, and some glitter.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7.42pm:</strong> Louis says it was mediocre. Cheryl doesn't know why she didn't sing at the start, and Rachel claims memory loss. Memory loss? The first line is the TITLE OF THE SONG. Simon says it was gimmicky and she looked uncomfortable. Dannii knew that Simon would hate everything about it; Rachel apologises to her for forgetting her lyrics, and Dannii reiterates how hard disco is as a genre. Dermot says, \"I never thought I'd hear Louis say that hunky angels were average.\" HA. Louis tries to interrupt. Dermot doesn't let him.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7.49pm:</strong> After the break, Dermot welcomes us back, and throws to Simon, who says he \"quite like[s]\" disco week. If you don't blinkin' like it, Cowell, why do you make us sit through it? Anyway, he introduces Austin, who enthuses about \"his\" single in the shops, which he buys. And then he proceeds to scrawl his name over the remaining copies on the shelves. He squeals about being on the red carpet at the Bond premiere. Will Young tells him to connect with the lyrics more, and relate to them emotionally. Simon thinks he should be connecting with the audience. Idiot NotLouis tells us that if he doesn't get it right, it'll be awkward. Thanks for that, Brainiac.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7.52pm:</strong> Austin is singing Wishing On A Star. Disco? Really? He has some beautiful buxom lady dancers. Because he is definitively heterosexual. He kneels next to them and seems to be looking up their skirts. It's all a bit meh, really. Louis thinks vocally it was good, but there is a problem with him and the public - he doesn't think they're connecting, because the likeability is missing. Ouch. Dannii talks about the \"six sexy sirens\" and compliments the production, and urges him to enjoy it. There's a bewildered silence from the audience. Cheryl congratulates NotLouis on the brilliant choreography, which I must have blinked and missed. Simon says that Austin has the hots for one of the dancers - because HE IS STRAIGHT - and then weirdly adds, \"You've probably got a girlfriend, so you're in trouble now.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7.56pm:</strong> Cheryl attempts to be gracious about being number two in the charts behind the charidee single, and introduces Diana, who does a very irritating humble act. At the Bond premiere, Gemma Arterton tips her to win due to her resemblance to Kate Bush, and then Cheryl seethes about Simon's criticism of her acts.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7.59pm:</strong> ROLLER-SKATES! Repeat, Brian Friedman has choreographed ROLLER-SKATES into Diana's version of Call Me! She's in legwarmers and a gold headband, and this looks like the Kids from Fame do Blondie. Visually, this is Not A Good Thing. Vocally, it's fine. Louis says he wants Diana to do dancing. Dannii says Diana and disco do not go together but it suited her, which makes little to no sense. Simon says that she's lucky she couldn't see what was going on behind her and that it was one of the worst routines EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD (I may have added that bit myself). NotLouis does a \"oh no you DID NOT, girlfriend\" face behind him. Cheryl informs Louis that it is not a dancing competition, and Louis agrees, but then pipes up, \"We want to see her dance...My acts are versatile!\" You only have ONE, Walsh.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8.05pm:</strong> Ad break. My friend Steve texts to plaintively ask, \"Why rollerskates? WHY?\" An excellent question, but one, I fear, to which we will never get a satisfactory answer.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8.08pm:</strong> Here is Daniel Evans. He was saved last week by Louis, for he sang his wife's favourite song. It was a song about someone who is dead. And Daniel's wife is dead too. It is very sad, and that is why Louis cried when giving his verdict last week. This week's sob story is that Daniel has stagefright, and he freezes in rehearsal. Will Young's like, yeah, me too, but I still manage to sing.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>8.10pm: </strong>Oh sweet Lord. Daniel is singing Don't Leave Me This Way. It is everything you can imagine it might be, but with a troupe of lady dancers in sequinned Lycra. Louis is pointedly not looking at the stage. Which is understandable, but a) rude and b) unprofessional. When it comes to the comments, Louis says, \"I hated it. I hated the dancing, I hated the singing\" but admits that he is the perfect pub singer. Cheryl quite rightly tells Daniel that he should stop listening to the criticism because it's nothing like as much as he'd get if he was singing professionally. Simon calls it one of the worst performances EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD, because of \"the ghastly choreography\" and the winking. Dannii, of course, goes against the grain and says it suited him. Oh, Dannii, you can't really think that.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>8.14pm:</strong> Cheryl introduces Laura, who mumbled all her words last week but was nonetheless hailed as the future of music. Edith Bowman, quite randomly, says that Laura is her favourite. Laura talks about how exciting it is to have a single, and then rather disingenuously mentions being written about in the press. Will Young sympathises. NotLouis hugs her. He can't like her that much, though, because he's got her sitting in a stupid glitterball-sparkly circular chair (with her back to the audience) for the start of her bellowed Somebody Else's Guy.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>8.19pm: </strong>Louis liked it - \"It's Laura - THE VOICE.\" Dannii reckons she shouldn't be able to do that at her age. Simon thought it was an outstanding vocal but a bit forced, and suggests that she's not connecting her look and performance, like Diana does (and at the mention of Diana, the audience booed), and that she ought to pay more attention to her image. I do enjoy the way Cheryl defends her acts like a lioness protecting her cubs, and she hits straight back, saying that she loves the way Laura looks, and she loved the song. Time for a break, and more alcohol. I think we all deserve it.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>8.26pm: </strong>Dermot welcomes us back, and Simon introduces Eoghan. EW. EW. He actually makes me shudder. Eoghan tells us that people were asking for his autograph at the Bond premiere. Were these people bussed in by Laura's boyfriend? I think we should be told. Will Young tells us that Eoghan has a softer voice than the others. NotLouis has given Eoghan a leading lady this week, which is just sick and wrong. Do you hear me, Friedman? SICK AND WRONG. He's covering Could It Be Magic, and as well as a leading lady, he has a Posse. However, before the beat kicks in, he suddenly sings really well - just like he did going into the key change last week. The rest of it is scrappy. At the end, his leading lady is laughing.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>8.33pm:</strong> Dannii introduces Ruth. Ruth, lest we forget, is Spanish. Last week, she looked beautiful, and Louis sneers that the red dress was the only reason she got through. Ruth reminds us that she is from a small town IN SPAIN. Dannii is worried because Ruth has been sick all week; her voice goes in rehearsal, and Will Young, bless him, looks utterly dumbstruck. \"Don't allow the throat infection to get into your head!\" he admonishes. Simon snipes about there always being \"some drama\".</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>8.35pm: </strong>This is one of my favourite songs in the history of ever. She is singing No More Tears (Enough Is Enough), and singing both vocals. Her pronunciation is off in the opening bars, and she is audibly straining her throat. Terrible arrangement leading into the key change, and I think we will all agree that this was a missed opportunity to cover Baccara.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>8.37pm:</strong> Louis likens Ruth to a matador. This is because she is Spanish. Cheryl reminds us that Ruth is not from the UK and thus she does not have a region voting for her. This is because she is originally from Spain. Simon says he couldn't argue with the passion of the performance, and that he felt like he was being dumped. Heh. Dannii accuses Louis of stealing Ruth's red dress last week, and there is no laughter. Ruth thanks the British public for voting to keep her in, and gives a shout-out to her family, who have travelled from Spain to watch her tonight. SIGH.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>8.44pm:</strong> Dermot sings the first line of Any Dream Will Do to a multicoloured-clad lady in the audience. Cheryl introduces Alexandra, with a promise of dancing. But if tonight's choreography so far is anything to go by, I wouldn't get too excited. Alex liked going to the premiere and standing on red carpet and kissing Dame Judi Dench. HOLY HELL, SHE HAS TOPLESS MALE DANCERS. Will Young looks singularly unimpressed by Alex's constant chest-belting. He advises that she should tone it down.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>8.46pm: </strong> Alex begins by reclining on a red sofa - Heidi, I think you might be right about the Ikea sponsorship. She is singing On The Radio, and the topless dancers strut around with her. The camerawork here is fabulous - close-ups of the dancing buttocks and everything. Seriously, this would be great at G-A-Y.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>8.48pm: </strong>Louis says that very few girls can sing Donna Summer songs, and that he loved Brian Friedman's choreography. OF COURSE YOU DID, WALSH. Dannii says something about touring that I don't really follow. Simon says that Alexandra is the most improved performer over the past few weeks, and then returns to the burning of Louis and his omitting her three years ago. Louis tries to defend himself by saying, \"Shayne Ward won that year!\", like that is ANY kind of explanation. Dermot mocks Louis, and Louis is stony-faced.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>8.52pm:</strong> Louis is all \"Simon is so jealous of JLS! There is a real buzz around them!\" JLS are all \"Ooh, there's a Bond girl! Wow!\" They have multicoloured jackets, for, as we learned last week, they all like different colours. They are singing Working My Way Back To You, and their choreography consists of John Sergeant-esque marching around the stage. Their vocals are bolstered hugely by off-stage backing singers. Key change!</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>8.56pm: </strong>Dannii tells them not to be drowned out by the backing singers. Cheryl tells them they are the best group EVER on The X Factor. Simon says they are back in the race, and that it was their best performance by a clear mile. Louis says they were never out of the race and urges us to vote for them. See, I like JLS, but if Louis wants me to vote for them, I am not going to.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>8.58pm:</strong> Bizarre interlude as Simon thanks Brian Friedman for his hideous, heinous creative direction, and then sounds surprised as he thanks Will Young for \"being great with the kids\". Dermot recaps for us - Rachel was lost in music along with various gay stereotypes; Austin LIKES LADIES; Diana had roller-skating dancers; Daniel didn't want us to leave him this way, but I'm fairly sure we will; Laura pined for Somebody Else's Guy in a bellowy way; Eoghan had a leading lady and pawed at her; Ruth is from Spain and imitated both Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer; Alexandra had semi-naked boys; JLS marched in military fashion.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>9.02pm:</strong> Well, folks, that's it for now. I'm off to watch the cricket, but join me at 9.50pm to see who'll be singing off!</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>9.45pm:</strong> NEWSFLASH! <a href=\"http://xfactor.itv.com/stories/story-detail/item_100325.htm\">La Willoughby is pregnant</a>! Congrats, Holly!</p> <p>NEWSFLASH! Ian Bell has just been bowled! England are 21-1!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>9.54pm: </strong>Earlier tonight! Nine acts sang for our votes. They are standing in a line-up and look like a bizarre Seventies identity parade. Dermot welcomes us to the results show, and tries to convince us that sparks have been flying. He then slides into incoherence when he attempts to explain the concept of the sing-off, and we get another recap. BORED NOW.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>9.58pm:</strong> Dermot claims we have tough choices to make tonight. Not so much, Dermy, for I shall not be voting. Anyway, before we get the results, we have an exclusive! live! performance! from Will Young, who bickered with Simon seven years ago and strangely it has not hampered his career. He is singing his new single Grace amidst a stageful of dry ice. His keyboard player has a Paul Weller haircut. There is a string section. Will does a weird footstampy thing towards the end. Let's crack on now, shall we? Dermot and Will hug, which is nice for a certain demographic. Will is happy to have worked with the contestants this week because he doesn't often get to talk about singing, and he bought them all CDs of music he thought would suit them. That's sweet.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>10.06pm: </strong>The lines have closed. Cue scary door slamming noise. But first, time for some more adverts!</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>10.09pm: </strong>The judges and contestants troop out on stage, and it's time for The Results. Singing next week are, in no particular order - Daniel (who screams, \"YOU ARE KIDDING!\"). Z.O.M.G.</p> <p>I'm not sure I can carry on now.</p> <p>But I must. </p> <p>So. Also through - Alexandra; Eoghan (for real? I WEEP FOR YOU, CLOTH-EARED BRITISH PUBLIC); JLS; Diana; Ruth; and finally, Laura.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>10.14pm:</strong> So that's Austin and Rachel in the final showdown. Simon witters a bit and messes up his adverbs, as usual. Austin is going to sing Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow by the Shirelles; Rachel is going to sing No Drama by Mary J Blige. They will, au naturellement, be doing this after the break.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>10.19pm: </strong>We're back. Austin and Rachel have handpicked their songs, and it is Rachel to go first. Dannii reminds us that this is what Rachel loves to do. She strides on and does aggressive, emotional pointing, crossing the stage incessantly. She seems to be struggling to sort her breathing out at first, but as she gets into it she belts it out (and multitasks by pushing her hair out of her eyes).</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>10.22pm:</strong> Simon hopes this isn't Austin's last performance. Austin himself has taken the opportunity to endear himself to a proportion of the judging panel by unbuttoning his shirt. I really don't like Austin's style of singing; too breathy and affected for my tastes. And I hate the way he smirks and closes his eyes. Also, the lip-licking thing he does. He reminds me of a lizard. Sinister.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>10.25pm: </strong>Dermot chats to them both. Rachel is sanguine; Austin sang FOR HIS MUM, and then bursts into tears. For. Goodness. Sake.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>10.26pm:</strong> Simon says this is the worst-case scenario because Austin is his act and he likes Rachel, but he has to send her home. Cheryl asks, \"Why do we have to do this part of the show?\" Because that's THE WHOLE POINT OF IT. She says that they were both good but Rachel hasn't had a moment to shine, so she sends home Austin. Dannii tells Austin it was fantastic, and tells Rachel she sang from the heart; she too saves her own act. The casting vote is again with Louis - he is going to save the person he thinks deserves a second chance. The act that he is sending home is <strong>Austin</strong>, meaning that Rachel is through.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>10.29pm: </strong>Austin talks about us not seeing the best of him and thanks us for giving him the chance to sing to his mum. Well, you can do that just as well at home, can't you, Drage?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>10.30pm:</strong> The requisite montage of Austin's highlights, and Simon comes on to hug him. He says, \"For me, he was one of the best singers tonight, so he can go out with his head held high.\" Austin assures us that we haven't seen the last of him. I am unconvinced. Next week - hold on to your hats - it's Mariah Carey night! It'll be a stormer. Join us then! x</p>",
  "<p>It's terribly easy to get irritated when you're pregnant. There are the hormones, of course, the quick tears, the unrequited anger. There's the unsolicited advice, the strange looks of condescending benevolence from strangers, the spontaneous laying-of-hands-on-the-belly. But as frustrating and annoying as the process can be (and yes, it can also be beautiful), in the US, it's still best when living in a state that allows a woman to proceed with her pregnancy the way she wants to.</p> <p>Two ballot initiatives on the docket for Tuesday would undermine that right, putting the rights of the \"unborn\" over the rights of the mother \u2013 including, and especially, mothers with wanted pregnancies. (This election year, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/06/usa.uselections2008\">I've written before</a>, in addition to deciding on the White House, several states are mulling ballot initiatives that determine everything from the right to adopt by gay parents to the right to marry to the right to end a pregnancy. It's the Culture Wars, part 100.)</p> <p>Yesterday the New York based nonprofit group, <a href=\"http://www.advocatesforpregnantwomen.org/blog/\">National Advocates for Pregnant Women</a>, released a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuC4gGSZ-yU\">video</a> detailing the impact Colorado's Proposition 48 and South Dakota's Measure 11 will have on all pregnant women.</p> <p>(Full disclosure: the executive director of NAPW, Lynn Paltrow is my cousin. It doesn't undermine their results of their studies, it just gives me better access to them.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YuC4gGSZ-yU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/YuC4gGSZ-yU&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/YuC4gGSZ-yU&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Bear with the production value of the video; by minute one you'll be hooked. Proposition 48 would give the right of \"personhood\" to the foetus at the moment of conception. NAPW argues, using case studies from states across the country, that \"foetal rights\" laws currently on the books from state to state have been used as a sledgehammer against the rights of pregnant women who want to carry their children to term. Example? By making foetal rights on a par with human rights, women who would like to have a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean section), or simply to avoid a cesarean, can be forced into surgery. A court injunction can be obtained by the hospital on behalf of the unborn child \u2013 assigning a lawyer to the foetus \u2013 that trumps the right of the woman carrying the baby. It's already happened in Pennsylvania, in Florida, and Maryland, states that guarantee similar personhood to the fetus. NAPW found women across the country who were once avowedly \"prolife\" but whose rights as pregnant women were compromised when their state advocated on behalf of the foetus rather than the mother. Such stories (well-described on the video) have made a hybrid campaign of women from across the political spectrum determined not to further politicise pregnancy.</p> <p>It's all very shocking, and very common. Only <a href=\"http://blog.aclu.org/2008/10/20/bureau-of-prisons-revises-policy-on-shackling-of-pregnant-inmates/\">last week</a> the Bureau of Prisons reversed the barbaric long-time practice of shackling incarcerated women during labour, delivery and recovery. (Human rights organisations globally had <a href=\"http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/34d0a773a44de02bc125725a0034cbdf?Opendocument\">protested</a> the practice for years, to no avail.) Outside of California, Illinois, and Vermont, states where the practice has been banned, women in federal prison have been regularly chained during delivery, a process that was not only demeaning and unnecessary but also severely compromised the health of the mother and infant. Despite this long-overdue advancement in prison policy, it will hardly be universally implemented. The <a href=\"http://blog.aclu.org/2008/10/20/bureau-of-prisons-revises-policy-on-shackling-of-pregnant-inmates/\">ACLU</a> report on the decision notes that not only do state and local prisons not have to adhere to the new federal guidelines, the US Immigrant and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can also \u2013 and has indicated it will \u2013 avoid the change, continuing to shackle women picked up for immigration violations, despite the fact that the immigrant women in custody and in question face no criminal charges.</p>",

So this is a rare thing: all of the big four playing on a Saturday, three of them at 3pm, one of them at home to <em>a team called Hull who are above them in the league</em>.</p> <p>While you'd fancy Chelsea (home to Sunderland), Manchester United (home to Hull) and Arsenal (away to Rory Delap) to win, this is yet another big day in Liverpool's march to an apparently pre-ordained 19th title, 19 years after the last one. They visit a rejuvenated Tottenham at 5.30pm: a gimme two weeks ago, but a really tricky test now. But that's for Scott Murray later in the day. In the meantime, we've got Everton v Fulha<em>COME BACK</em>m now, and then all those 3pm kick-offs.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.42pm</strong> \"I've got a feeling about this game\" says Andy Gray, taking Sky's predilection for overhyping even the most unpolished of wotsits to new levels of indignity. It's Everton v Fulham for heaven's sake!</p> <p>\"Morning Rob,\" says Alex Netherton. \"'Human frailty, it makes me sick sometimes.' Oh wait, I mean Danny Murphy.\" For some reason, and in spite of little factors like a) him scoring the winner at Old Trafford three years in four, b) him being Danny Murphy and c) see a), I've always had a soft spot for Danny Murphy. Such a classily unobtrusive footballer, not unlike myself, and despite disturbing reports of shell suits, generally someone with more going on between the lugholes than most footballers. </p> <p>Big big congratulations, incidentally, to my nephew Ciaran, who today passed his 11+ with flying colours. He's already the brainbox of the Smyth family; well, look at the competition. He's off to celebrate with fizzy pop and pizza. Imagine being 11 again!</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12.47pm</strong> They've kicked off. \"Afternoon, Rob,\" says Declan. Folk are so polite today. \"Have you heard the backing track to Parry &amp; Gray's team analysis on the Goodison tannoy? Not one, not two but <em>three</em> execrable 70s stylee, \"Everton, Everton\" themes. Z-Cars to follow, thankfully.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong> Whip on your anorak, let's have us a party, woo-hoo</strong> I found a great stat yesterday. Eric Cantona is the fastest to 50 assists since football began, in 1992, having done so in 96 games. And the second-fastest in 99 matches? Not Henry, Cole, Bergkamp, Giggs or Lyttle, but Mikel Arteta.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12.53pm</strong> Nothing has happened so far. Sweet diddly. <em>Nothing</em>. These sides are a point apart in the bottom half of the league, although Fulham, with 11 to Everton's 12, have a game in hand. Everton, perversely, have yet to win at home this season; Fulham, predictably, are yet to win away.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12.57pm</strong> The first half-chance of the game. Cahill on the left waited for Arteta to overlap before sliding the ball down the line. Arteta then cut a cross back to the near post, where Pienaar's flicked header went straight at Schwarzer.</p> <p>There's a fairly open, almost lazy feel to the game, with both sides lacking an orthodox cruncher in the centre of midfield (Fulham have Bullard and Murphy; Everton have Fellaini and Osman), but so far neither side has found anything resembling a rhythm.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1.01pm</strong> Alan Parry makes the inevitable comparison between Fellaini, who for the uninitiated sports some Spandex-tight corkscrew curls, and the Scousers in Harry Enfield. Still, at least we had 13 minutes' grace before he could wait no longer to tickle the nation's ribs. Still not much going on. It's not a negative game, or even an especially poor one. It's just a game between two mediocre sides.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1.08pm</strong> \"Just one question,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Why?\" Well nobody told me that scented string vests had gone out of fash- oh hang on, there's a bit before that from Naylor. \"I hope nobody in the crowd is too hungover - just one look at that purple and yellow ball would induce vomit from the strongest stomach.\" Do they not always use them?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1.10pm</strong> What I said at 1.01pm was a lie. This is poor. It's still open - only four fouls in the first quarter, as Andy Gray points out in what is in no way an attempt to justify his pre-match assertion that he had a feeling about the game - but there's a startling lack of quality.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.13pm</strong> \"Afternoon Rob,\" says Neill Brown. \"Like you, I am at work today. And, like you, I am staring at a screen with nothing interesting going on (accrual spreadsheets since you didn't ask). Still, as Arsene Wenger's considered a top manager, I'm going to follow his example and give up work 15 minutes early today because apparently my work will all be done by then.\" Is that funny? I honestly can't tell anymore.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.14pm</strong> Can you be done for plagiarising yourself? Because really all I want to do is repeat the 1.10pm entry. Bullard scrunches another one wide from distance. Fulham have played some unpleasant stuff in midfield, but up front they have nothing. Well, they have Andy Johnson and Bobby Zamora. So, yeah, nothing.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.15pm</strong> Fellaini, who clearly has quite the eye for goal, picks up a loose ball on the edge of the box and almost passes it onto the near post. It bounces clear and, just as Yakubu is about to blast inexplicably over an open net from six yards, Aaron Hughes nips in front of him splendidly to clear.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.19pm</strong> Big chance for Fulham. Bullard curves in a lovely cross from the right to Zamora six yards out. His header is smothered by Howard, but the ball breaks to Johnson on the edge of the six-yard box. Instead of shooting, he decides to pause, consider the meaning of life, stick his hands on his hips in the camp style and then smoke a nice cigar. By the time he's done so, the chance has gone.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> Now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0dghVN8ZWw\">this</a> is funny. That much I do know.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong> <br>Here's Gary Naylor. \"Is it me or is the quality of football in the Premier League and Champions League poorer this year than for a few seasons? Liverpool are the leading team, but haven't really played well consistently, there's no one player who is outstanding and the crises in goalkeeping and refereeing have produced more goals than moments of sublime skill. After a splendid Euro 2008, the fare on offer in the Premier League looks very second best. The hype merchants keep telling us that club football is better than international football, but it's not.\" I think Euro 2008 was a fluke, glorious though it was, and that football generally is much poorer than it was back in the day. Goalkeeping is at a particularly low ebb. In fact so is humanity, but goalkeeping especially.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.27pm</strong> Filth. Abject filth. \"What's currently puzzling me is why there is a group of what appears to be about 20 red-uniformed Chelsea pensioners near the corner flag on Everton's left wing,\" says Declan. \"Have they invaded? Or maybe defected?\" You couldn't really call them glory-hunters, could you. What's the phrase for when you downgrade teams?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.29pm</strong> Hangeland uses Fellaini like he's a Krypton Factor prop, jumping all over him in the penalty area. As Andy Gray says, 99 times out of 100 that's a free-kick outside the area, but the ref, Lee Mason, wasn't interested in giving what, technically, was a clear penalty.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.31pm</strong> \"Re: Naylor at 1.25pm,\" begins Neill Brown. \"The outstanding player of the season so far is Frank Lampard. Make of that what you will.\" Lampard remains farcically underrated, mainly because people can't see the wood for their own <em>trees of hate and envy</em>. I think Lampard's the greatest/most influential player in Chelsea's history, although I realise that, with their modest past, that's not a million miles from winning a 'best moment on Soccer AM' competition.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.34pm: Half-time: Everton 0-0 Fulham</strong> I look forward to seeing Richard Keys talk this one up. It was garbage. Everton were the least-worst: Fellaini hit the post and then should have had a penalty when Hangeland put his hands where he shouldn't in the penalty box. But it was a half of depressingly low quality. Still, come back in 15 minutes! It'll be better! Honest! Please!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.36pm</strong> \"Yo yo Robert,\" says Alex Perkins. \"Fellaini is a dead ringer (yes, pun intended) for Dustin Diamond aka Screech from TV's Saved by the Bell.\" I was more a My So-Called Life kinda gal.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.48pm</strong> \"In no way was I discrediting Lampard, Rob,\" says Neill Brown. \"My point was that he has stood out in a spectacular fashion in all of Chelsea's games so far but has only looked decent in the international games. I think Gary has a good argument as to the quality of international v club football.\" Oh I wasn't having a go at you \u2013 if I was I'd have slipped in an eff and a cee and some lame joke based on your surname \u2013 but just making a general observation.</p> <p>I totally disagree that international football is better, though. Most of the big teams are all over the show at the moment, and England would get hammered by any of the big four. Heskey, Torres, Berbatov, Drogba or Adebayor? Case closed, Columbo.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.50pm</strong> The fun's over and the second half has started. \"In this instance, they're more dumpster divers than glory hunters,\" says Ben Smith of those blokes mentioned in the first half.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>1.51pm</strong> It's an indictment of how poor international football is, in fact, that Andy Johnson has played it. He's done nothing today except wear premature baldness with elan.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> Big chance for Everton. Arteta's stepover on the left gives him half a yard against Pantsil, who doesn't really those last two letters given how well he performs, and he kisses a lovely cross to the back post where Cahill, charging in among the bodies, thumps a header over from six yards. For a finisher of his quality, that was close to a sitter.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.58pm</strong> One of the Sky mics picks up somebody - no idea who - using the phrase \"effing ballboys\". That's the Daily Mail's front-page story for Monday sorted.</p> <p>\"'What's the phrase for when you downgrade teams?' quotes Gary Naylor. \"Is it 'I've decided to support my local team' (spoken in a Bristol accent)?\" That's not as good as your Welsh accent.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>2.01pm</strong> The odd thing about this game is not that it's been garbage - welcome to the Premier League, ladies and germs - but that it's been so lethargic. For Fulham, so poor away from home, that's fair enough: a draw is a draw is a draw. But for Everton it's less explicable, especially given how they got in among Manchester United last week. They are, as someone once said, cheating their manager.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>2.02pm</strong> Gera hits the bar, but he should have scored. A corner from the right went all the way across the box, from where Zamora hung up a delightful ball for Gera, running in unmolested, to thump a header off the bar from six yards. Unlike Cahill a few minutes ago he was under no pressure, and had more momentum from his run, so that goes down as a criminal miss.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>2.05pm</strong> \"Lampard is underrated that's true, but is he really better than Gianfranco Zola?\" says George Templeton. \"I know I haven't watched football for as long as many people and I am no Chelsea fan, but Zola was magnificent and from what I've seen/read, was magnificent most of the time he graced the pitch for Chelsea?\" That he was but \u2013 and I know this isn't the answer to everything \u2013 look at their medals' cabinets. Fwank has been the most important attacking player in by far the best period in Chelsea's history, which will do for me. It's official: I Heart Fwank.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>2.06pm</strong> Everton substitution: Saha on for Fellaini, a decision greeted with widespread boos. Cahill will drop back into midfield, with Saha going up top. Fellaini has been pretty impressive, but I understand the decision: Osman is the nominal sitting player, so he had to stay on, and Cahill is such a goal threat that he wanted to keep him on. Cahill and Fellaini isn't a realistic centre-midfield pairing.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2.08pm</strong> The feistometer has gone up a notch or two: 1, 2, 3, 4 you might say. First Johnson left a foot in on his old team-mate Osman, and now Schwarzer feels the joy of Yakubu's boot after he dropped a cross.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.12pm</strong> If every single attacker on the pitch did not require post-it notes to enable them to distinguish between elbow and derriere, it would be about 3-3 because the defences remain open. Cahill puts in a sly leg-deadener on Bullard: the ball was still sort of there, enough to make it look like an honest attempt to play the ball, but he knew what he was doing. But Bullard is up and looks fine now.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> Bullard shoots, at a conservative estimate, 974 miles wide. In fact that whooshed so far wide that I think it went back in time.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.16pm</strong> Some team news for Middlesbrough v West Ham yeah?<br> <strong>Middlesbrough</strong> Turnbull, Wheater, Riggott, Pogatetz, Taylor, Aliadiere, O'Neil, Digard, Downing, Sanli, Alves. Subs: Jones, Hoyte, Mido, Emnes, Arca, Adam Johnson, Grounds. </p> <p><strong>West Ham</strong> Green, Neill, Collins, Upson, Ilunga, Faubert, Collison, Mullins, Boa Morte, Bellamy, Sears. Subs: Walker, Lopez, Etherington, Tristan, Bowyer, Tomkins, Di Michele.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.17pm</strong> The wodwork is hit for the third time today. Bullard coaxes a lovely free-kick over the wall which Howard, diving across goal from left to right, can only fist straight out in front of him. It comes to Zamora, inside the six-yard box but at a slight angle, and he can only scuff it across goal, past the two defenders running back, and onto the far post. A pretty pith-poor effort, in truth.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Portsmouth v Wigan team news</strong></p> <p><strong>Portsmouth</strong> James, Johnson, Campbell, Distin, Belhadj, Diop, Diarra, Davis, Armand Traore, Crouch, Defoe. Subs: Ashdown, Kaboul, Pamarot, Utaka, Kranjcar, Hughes, Kanu. </p> <p><strong>Wigan</strong> Kirkland, Melchiot, Bramble, Boyce, Figueroa, Valencia, Palacios, Cattermole, Koumas, Heskey, Zaki. Subs: Pollitt, Taylor, Scharner, Kilbane, Brown, De Ridder, Camara.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.21pm</strong> Anichebe on for Pienaar. \"I'm quite happy with Fellaini and Cahill as a centre-midfield pairing with one going and one staying dependent on the play, but it won't work with Osman, Arteta and Pienaar as the other three,\" says Gary Naylor. \"We need the Lee Carsley role as defensive midfielder sorting out as there's no player in the club suited to playing there. Under Moyes, Everton have played their best football in a 4-1-3-1-1 formation, with the first of those \"1\"s allowing the other \"3-1-1\" to play.\" I agree completely about Carsley, but surely you couldn't play Fellaini in a straight 4-4-2, which is what they're playing with Saha and Yakubu on. Or could you?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Altrincham v Histon team news</strong></p> <p><strong>Altrincham</strong> Coburn, Lane, McGregor, Young, Densmore, Doughty, Lawton, Danylyk, Senior, Little, Elam.

He humped it downfield and, as Mark Schwarzer came to collect, Yakubu eased his not inconsiderable backside into Schwarzer - manoeuvre that has served man very well on Carling-stained dancefloors but here only produces a foul: it sends Schwarzer flying in the comedy style and allows the ball to plop into the net. They wouldn't have given that for the home side down the road, never mind at Goodison.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Man Utd v Hull team news</strong> The best midfielder in England, Michael Carrick, returns for his first game in almost two months.</p> <p><strong>Man Utd</strong> Van der Sar, Neville, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo, Carrick, Anderson, Nani, Berbatov, Rooney.

The excellent Osman pings in a lovely dipping cross from the right and Saha, seven yards out, nails a firm header to the right of Schwarzer, who gets a hand on it but can only help it into the net. That's harsh on Fulham in truth, but Everton will not give a flyer, and nor should we as - thank goodness - this game is nearly over.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.38pm. Full time: Everton 1-0 Fulham</strong> So Everton finally win their first home game of the season and, almost absurdly given the gloom surrounding the club of late, move up to seventh for the time being. They are still not playing well, but it does seem that that well-earned draw against Manchester United was a turning point. Since then they have claimed two wins and, almost more importantly given their early-season travails, two clean sheets.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.41pm</strong> \"Ah the medals argument which I will counter with the money argument,\" says George Templeton. \"Zola was never in a team that spent the kind of cash and thusly had the glittering array of talent that Lampard has been surrounded with. No doubt Lampard has been one of the key figures of Chelsea's reign at or near the top, but don't you think Zola could've just as well if Chelsea had a sugar daddy owner like they do now. My argument is that if Zola had the opportunity to play as many big matches as Lampard, he would've come up trumps just as many if not more times. Admittedly my judgement might be clouded by his performance against England. But look at us, neither one of us are Chelsea fans and we're debating this, I wonder what they think?\" That, alas, would require <em>more than two people to be reading this</em>, but fair play for trying.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.52pm</strong> \"I'm trying to concentrate on designing a newsletter for a firm of Property Consultants, but Danylyk listed in the starting line up for Altrincham?

Sorry about that: I just poured coffee all down my silk pink waistcoat in hilarious fashion.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>3.05pm: Manchester United 1-0 Hull (Ronaldo 3)</strong> Reality is starting to sink its seriously sharp teeth into Hull's collective dusters. That goal was devastatingly simple: Berbatov played the ball infield from the right and Ronaldo, back to goal, controlled it with his right foot and then turned to sweep it in off the near post with his left from 18 yards. An excellent, precise finish, and <em>he even smiled</em>. It's his sixth of the season. Who says he can't get 42 again?</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.06pm</strong> \"As a follow up,\" says James Sparling, \"you might be interested to read that <a href=\"http://www.football.co.uk/altrincham_town/players/anthony_danylyk_115516.shtml\">Danylyk's stats</a> give a new meaning to the whole size zero debate...

That was absurdly simple: the throw missed out the hordes at the near post and found Fuller, one one one against Toure at the back post. Fuller climbed all over Toure, legitimately so, and planted a header into the corner from five yards.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.14pm: West Brom 0-1 Blackburn (McCarthy 13pen</strong> \"Losses after 86-match unbeaten runs at home are like buses coming as they do all at once,\" says Ian Copestake, \"so I fully expect Chelsea to lose again today. However, there is a Sunderland shaped hole in this scenario.\" Chelsea are, as you'd expect, all over Sunderland like a cheap one, but haven't had too many dangerous efforts as yet.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.21pm: Middlesbrough 0-1 West Ham (Mullins 18)</strong> How contrary are Middlesbrough? They get results when you never expect them to and then go 1-0 down to West Ham. And Hayden Mullins. He smacked it in off the bar after making a mess of the chance originally, and West Ham have a decent chance of ending their run of four straight defeats. In other news, at Fratton Park, Peter Crouch has hit the bar for Portsmouth against Wigan.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.23pm: Man Utd 1-1 Hill (Cousin 23)</strong> Reality has just snapped one of its front teeth on Hull's rock-hard swingers: they've equalised through Daniel Cousin! Vidic was penalised for having a feel of Marlon Link's polyester and, from the inswinging free-kick by Andy Dawson, Cousin flicked a superb header across Van Der Sar and into the corner. That's a really good goal.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.29pm: Chelsea 1-0 Sunderland (Alex 27)</strong> Chelsea resume normal service: Alex scores their 1000th Premier League goal from a distance of approximately 0.4 yards. The lovely thing about this is that it was from open play and yet it's the centre-back who scores: Alex gave it to Lampard 40 yards out and kept running. It eventually went to Joe Cole, who cut in from the right and drove it goalwards with his left foot. Fulop couldn't hold it, plunging to his left, and Alex did the rest, although he might just have been offside when Cole had the shot.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.31pm: Manchester United 2-1 Hull (Carrick 29)</strong> England's best midfielder, Michael Carrick, scores a fine goal. It was a beautiful counter-attack, starting with Vidic just outside his own six-yard box. He found Rooney, he found Berbatov, he found Carrick, and he took two touches on the run before sweeping a daisy-cutter across Myhill and in off the post from 17 yards. Lovely stuff, with shades of Andrei Kanchelskis's semi-legendary goal at Carrow Road in April 1993, particularly in the way that it began with a first-time 40-yard pass from the centre of defence.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.32pm: Chelsea 2-0 Sunderland (Anelka 30)</strong> Nicolas Anelka seals the game for Chelsea. Already. Lampard crossed, Alex took a touch and Anelka - coming from what looked like an offside position - stole the chance from him like that little git used to do in the playground, scoring from a few yards.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.36pm</strong> Anyone out there?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.38pm</strong> Benni McCarthy has been sent off at West Brom for two yellow cards - he hadn't been booked for over a year before that - and Paul Ince is going ballistic. The second was for deliberate handball. \"Anelka is a goal thief!\" screams George Templeton, as if this were the height of deviancy.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.42pm</strong> Charles Antaki isn't in a good place, all told. \"What's the point trying to listen out for an Arsenal equaliser while working on my FreeCell average? Obviously they've all given up for the season and are waiting to be off to Club Bruges in January. Or the Sundowner Retirement Home for Useless Defenders, in Silvestre's case.\" They are going to finish fourth this year, and by some distance, aren't they? Arsene knows!</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.46pm: Man Utd 3-1 Hull (Ronaldo 44)</strong> Just 35 to go now. Nani's outswinging corner is thumped in by the head of Cristiano Ronaldo at the near post. United have been excellent, and the pasting that United have threatened to dish out all season may be coming Hull's way.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>3.47pm: Portsmouth 0-1 Wigan (Zaki 45pen)</strong> Papa Bouba Diop gives away another stupid penalty, tripping over Titus Bramble just as Bramble was about to lump the ball out of the ground. Amr Zaki whacks it straight down the middle for his ninth of the season.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3.48pm: Chelsea 3-0 Sunderland (Anelka 45)</strong> Chelsea score a goal that isn't offside, with Anelka ending an excellent move to grab his second of the game.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3.51pm</strong> So, the half-time scores.</p> <p>Chelsea 3-0 Sunderland (1-0 if you only count goals that are onside)<br>Man Utd 3-1 Hull<br>Middlesbrough 0-1 West Ham<br>Portsmouth 0-1 Wigan<br>Rory Delap 1-0 Arsenal<br>West Brom 0-1 Blackburn</p> <p>And in the evening kick-off it's Spurs 0-1 Liverpool. Well we might as well accept it now and move on with our lives.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>3.54pm</strong> \"My main interest in the Premier League these days is hoping that Liverpool's tedious grind to the top of the table falls apart sooner rather than later,\" says Tom Hopkins, the face of Serotonin. \"So, given they're not playing, what did you think of Dead Set?\" Totally forgot about it. Any good?</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>3.59pm</strong> \"Surely the Man Utd score is only 1-1 if you discount the goals scored by a twonk\" ahahahahahahahahahahahahahas Ian Copestake.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>4.03pm</strong> The second half begins. \"Frank Lampard is underrated only by opposing fans, not by the press or Chelsea fans,\" says Liban Saleh. \"Also, Steven Gerrard is the best midfielder England has (and I'm a United fan), whilst Carrick is England's best passer.\" Gerrard and his fan club can guzzle on my fun-shapes. He is unstoppable, yes, but only one game in every 50. And his short passing game \u2013 the most important thing in a midfielder where I come from \u2013 is non-existent.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>4.06pm</strong> Roy Keane has made a half-time substitution, bringing on El-Hadji Diouf for Martyn Waghorn. Sadly the horse, unlike Triggs, is not going come back the moment Roy calls it. And apparently Keane has been sent to the stands, probably for pointing out, maybe in creative language, that the first two goals were offside.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>4.09pm</strong> \"Hi Rob,\" says Russell George, procrastinating from his work, Oxford, it says here. \"I once shamelessly stole a goal from a team mate during a cub match. I honestly thought it was OK to run 30 years to tap home a shot that was trickling in anyway, and didn't understand the reaction of my team mate afterwards. If Richard (I think) who played for the Thaxted Panthers around 1985 is reading this, I'm sorry. It was a title decider, and I realised at an early age that this might be as good as it got. I was right.\" You ran 30 <em>years</em>. Firing up the DeLorean for a smidgin of self-validation is pretty tragic.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>4.11pm: Chelsea 4-0 Sunderland (Fwank 51)</strong> Fwank scores his customary goal, but this is bigger than most: it's his 100th in league football. It was all about Joe Cole, really. He skinned McCartney on the right of the box and stood up a lovely ball to the back post. Fwank, six yards out, strained his neck muscles and eased his header to the right of Fulop.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>4.14pm: Chelsea 5-0 Sunderland (Anelka 53)</strong> Any camerman worth his salt would focus on Roy Keane's phizog right now, but for the time being they're showing repeats of Anelka's hat-trick goal. Malouda broke down the left and played it across the face of goal for Anelka, eight yards out, to stretch and stab it in via the goalkeeper Fulop. Now they cut to Keane, who is sat in the stands and chewing his gum with a ferocity that makes it seem like the most foreboding thing in the history of the world. I don't think Wrigley's will be offering him a deal.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>4.16pm: West Brom 1-1 Blackburn (Bednar 55)</strong> We've waited a long, long time for Roy Keane's meltdown. I think there might be some post-match fun(k) today.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>4.18pm: Man Utd 4-1 Hull (Vidic 57)</strong> Nemanja Vidic volleys United into a surely unassailable three-goal lead. It was a corner from the right, by Rooney this time, and Vidic at the near post bundled it first-time under Myhill from about eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.21pm</strong> \"Russell George (4:09pm) didn't use his DeLorean,\" says Mac Millings. \"I heard he actually played cub football for 30 years before finally scoring. Which was not only sad but, by the end, a little creepy.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>4.22pm: West Brom 2-1 Blackburn (Miller 62)</strong> A screamer from Ishmael Miller has put West Brom in front against ten-man Blackburn. Here's an email from Qasim Nauman, who has chosen to presume that our tens of readers already know which team he supports. \"I was following the scores of the United and Chelsea matches, until I realised the utter pointlessness of it all: our main competitors this season are Villa, Man City, and maybe Hull for fourth place, especially considering that Alexandre Song is our midfield 'enforcer'.\" Not replacing Flamini was inexplicable. Still, Arsene knows!</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4.26pm</strong> \"I don't know if you've got Five Live on for the United game but Jan Molby's accent never fails to amuse,\" says Michael Gibbons. \"Like when you mix blue and yellow to get green, it appears if you whisk up Scouse and Danish in a blender you get what sounds like a Dutch morph (little plasticine bloke from Tony Hart's seminal Heartbeat).\" It is, without question, the best hybrid accent ever, although I probably wouldn't want to hear it during pillow talk.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.29pm: Man Utd 4-2 Hull (Mendy 69)</strong> Insert your own patronising comment about Hull's spirit here. They never give up, mind: Evra's back header is short and Bernard Mendy - who gave away 12 penalties and scored 14 own-goals in one pre-season friendly - puts something back in the bank by lobbing high over Van Der Sar. Vidic hooked it away from under the bar on the volley but it was definitely over the line.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.31pm</strong> Distin and Crouch both head against the bar in the space of about five seconds.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.34pm: Rory Delap 2-0 Arsenal (Olofinjana 73)</strong> Oh dear, oh dear. This is a shambles for Arsenal. It was another long throw, flicked on by Fuller (I think). It found Olofinjana, who was six yards out and started staggering before falling over like somebody who'd been in Wetherspoons since midday. As he did so, the ball hit at least two parts of his body, one of which might have been his hand, before scooting past Almunia. \"He's scored it with his tits!\" exclaims Scott Murray across the desk.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>4.37pm: Robin Van Persie sent off</strong> Arsenal are having the definitive shocker. Van Persie, only just on as a substitute, is given a straight red for a minor assault on the Stoke keeper Sorensen. You know that thing in Fifa 98 when, if you were in a funk, you could just hump the keeper up in the air and get a straight red card? Basically Van Persie did that, thudding into him with his shoulder as Sorensen picked the ball up. Sorensen must wonder what he has done to offend north London, after Alan Hutton rearranged his eye a couple of weeks ago. Arsene Wenger must wonder how on earth Arsenal have tossed away five points - and with it, surely, the title - this week. Still, Arsene knows!</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.39pm</strong> \"Speaking of hybrid accents,\" said Qasim Nauman, \"anyone remember Thomas Hitzlesperger's German + Brummie linguistic alloy?\" Remember it? His post-match interview against Villa in 2003 is the most played MP3 on my iPod.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>4.42pm: Man Utd 4-3 Hull (Geovanni 81pen)</strong> This is a joke. United were 4-1 up but Hull are showing remarkable resilience. Ferdinand is penalised for winning a battle of strength with Mendy - there was a tangle of legs but I'm not sure Ferdinand was any more or less culpable than Mendy - and Geovanni does the necessary from the spot.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>4.43pm: Middlesbrough 1-1 West Ham (Mido 83)</strong> Seriously, though: 4-3. W. T. Eff.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>4.44pm: Portsmouth 1-1 Wigan (Kranjcar 82)</strong> Portsmouth get a deserved equaliser, through Niko Kranjcar, after battering Wigan in the second half. At Old Trafford, Wayne Rooney is apparently lucky not to be sent off after having a hack at both Boateng and Ashbee.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>4.45pm: West Brom 2-2 Blackburn (Andrews 89)</strong> Ten-man Blackburn have equalised through Keith Andrews, and <em>if one more person on an unnamed football forum says it's 4-4 at Old Trafford I'm going to remake Falling Down in a postmodern fashion</em>. It's isn't 4-4, it's 4-3. But it's all Hull. I genuinely can't take this.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>Full time: Chelsea 5-0 Sunderland</strong> But the best bit - Roy Keane's post-match press conference - might yet be to come. At Stoke, Theo Walcott is being stretchered off with what looks like it could be a serious shoulder injury, so Arsenal are down to nine men, and they'll be nine points off the pace when Liverpool win 1-0 at Tottenham later in the day.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>4.54pm: Rory Delap 2-1 Arsenal</strong> A twice-deflected free-kick from Gael Clichy is surely no more than a consolation for nine-man Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>Full time: Manchester United 4-3 Hull</strong> Don't ever put me through that again. Ever.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>4.56pm: Portsmouth 1-2 Wigan (Heskey 90)</strong> That is ridiculous. Portsmouth have hit the woodwork four times, but Emile Heskey has stolen it for Wigan in the final minute, with his 100th Premier League goal from just 9,412,412,723,129 shots.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>Full time: Portsmouth 1-2 Wigan</strong> Twilight robbery.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>Full time: Rory Delap 2-1 Arsenal</strong> Didn't see that one coming, did you? What sort of world is it in which a team of <em>Tony Pulis's</em> beats a team of Arsene Wenger's? </p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>So that's it</strong> To recap, here are the scores from the Premier League.</p> <p>Chelsea 5-0 Sunderland<br>Everton 1-0 Fulham<br>Man Utd 4-3 Hull<br>Middlesbrough 1-1 West Ham<br>Portsmouth 1-2 Wigan<br>Stoke 2-1 Arsenal<br>Tottenham 0-1 Liverpool*<br>West Brom 2-2 Blackburn</p> <p>*kicks off at 5.30pm</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>But wait!

Thanks for all your emails. It's been defiantly very.</p>",
  "<p>Studs Terkel \u2014 master chronicler of American life in the 20th century, veteran radical and vibrant soul of the midwestern capital of Chicago \u2014 has died, aged 96. To register him as \"writer and broadcaster\" would be like calling Louis Armstrong a \"trumpeter\" or the Empire State Building an \"office block\". Strictly and sparsely speaking, it is true.</p> <p>He is best known to Americans as the voice that asked the questions on the Studs Terkel Show which ran for 45 years, syndicated from the WFMT radio station of downtown Chicago. The tapes of his interviews take up rack after rack at WFMT; there are 9,000 of them, and Studs was setting about a catalogue when he fell ill.</p> <p>The names of his guests, written in magic marker on the side of each tape, constitute the recent history not only of America but of the world: Simone de Beauvoir, Margot Fonteyn, Arthur Miller, JK Galbraith, Tennessee Williams, Andr\u00e9s Segovia, Margaret Mead, Leonard Bernstein, Jacob Bronowski and so on \u2014 including Bertrand Russell, recorded at the age of 90 during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.</p> <p>As you listen, you know in your bones that each person has never told their story as cogently or as fully before and will never do so again, for that was Terkel's art. He was maestro of that most precious craft in the practice of both journalism and history: listening. He was the world's greatest \u2014 and loudest-mouthed \u2014 listener. He even called his 1973 autobiography Talking to Myself.</p> <p>But this distinction did much more for the archives of history than bequeath unrepeatable recordings of the great, the good and the gregarious. Terkel's obsessive interest in the propulsion of people's lives was at its most curious and passionate \u2014 and his subjects at their most brilliantly articulate \u2014 when he was dealing with everyday people, from whatever background: carpenters, judges, hub-cap fitters, priests, admirals, sharecroppers, models, signalmen, tennis players, war veterans and cooks. His book Coming of Age: the History of our Century by Those Who've Lived It (1995), was made up of interviews with elderly people. It is a vivid record of an America which, for the most part, is now distant if not passed away along with Terkel himself.</p> <p>People call Terkel's business \"oral history\", but it is more like the weaving of a fabulous verbal tapestry, the threads of which are human preoccupations. It is the rich art of taking the vernacular, and making it eternal. Such a process does not merely record the details that keep people's minds busy, it gives them value. Terkel harvested not only the most complete American history of this century, but the most compassionate.</p> <p>In a way, Terkel's story is best told through that of Hobart Foote. When one asked Terkel which of all 9,000 interviewees he valued most, the answer was this one, which made it into a book, Working (1974).</p> <p>Foote lived in a mobile home near the Illinois-Indiana state line with his wife, a Bible and little else but \"the clangor of trains, Gary-to-Chicago bound\". The area is a great mesh of railroad lines, criss-crossing the roads. And so Foote talks about the \"train problem\" he has getting to work, since his journey is punctuated by so many railway crossings and long waits for lumbering freight trains to pass, and if he arrives a minute after nine, he gets docked for the whole hour.</p> <p>And so Foote's drive to work is a daily adventure, driving at speed to a detailed but flexible system across the assault course of railway crossings, changing the route according to which train is late or on time, which crossing shut and which open. \"It's a game you're playing,\" he tells Studs. \"Catch this light at a certain time, and then you've got the next light. But if there's a train there, I take off down Cicero Avenue and watch those crossings. And if I make her okay, you've got a train just over on the Burnham line you gotta watch for. But it's generally fast ...\"</p> <p>Why does Terkel remember this especially? \"Because it's a great suspense tale. An adventure thriller through the railroads every morning, so this man doesn't get docked for the whole hour. The principle is that ordinary people have extraordinary thoughts \u2014 I've always believed that \u2014 and that ordinary people can speak poetically. Also that no one else speaks like that and that there is no other person like that in the world.\"</p> <p>Terkel used to recommend a poem to people he met, called Chicago, by Carl Sandburg: \"Hog Butcher for the world / Tool-maker, Stacker of Wheat / Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler / Stormy, husky, brawling / City of the Big Shoulders ...\"</p> <p>This was the city to which Terkel's family moved from the New York Bronx in 1920, when he was nine years old. He had been born in New York the year the Titanic sunk: \"I'm a Titanic baby,\" he used to say. His real name was Louis; \"Studs\" came later, pinched from Studs Lonigan, title of a Chicago 1930s novel by James T Farrell.</p> <p>If America consists of two great coasts, the south and a vast real-life in-between, then Chicago is the capital of that in-between. It was, and is, the capital of work, the cast-iron, steel-and-glass leveller of men; the city where dust from the \"subway\" system elevated above the streets on iron stilts showers down on the bipeds beneath regardless of status. Chicago, said Terkel, \"is the country. It is America, it is a metaphor for everything.\"</p> <p>His mother Annie opened a boarding hotel for migrant workers \u2014 roughnecks, political agitators and vagrants, by whom the young boy was captivated. \"I used to listen to their stories for hours and hours. The good and the bad, coming through my own house, and I couldn't hear enough of it.\"</p> <p>The young Studs was also entranced by the sounds of jazz and blues \u2014 \"to which people would dance on a dime\" \u2014 coming out from the the smoky, sweaty music halls. \"I used to stand by the door, on the sidewalk, and listen.\" </p> <p>Later, Studs would guide the careers of Big Bill Broonzy and other blues stars, and befriend Billie Holiday. \"She was really something,\" Studs recalled, \"with that gardenia in her hair.\" Holiday once sang Willow Weep for Me for Terkel and nine other people. \"We weren't weeping for her, we were weeping for ourselves,\" he later said, \"That's an artist.\"</p> <p>Terkel went to study law at Chicago University, graduating in 1934. \"I was miserable,\" he recalled, and conceived an ambition to join the civil service. But after an unsuccessful interview with the FBI, he failed to qualify and abandoned that aspiration. From then on, Studs said, his progress was \"an accumulation of accidents\".</p> <p>A perforated eardrum restricted his war years to \"limited service\", and he was drafted into the remarkable Works Project Administration scheme, assigned to chart the nooks, crannies, ways and means of his beloved Chicago.</p> <p>It was a blue-collar town built on steel mills, stockyards, the railroad and the construction of its own mighty self. This is how Terkel saw it: \"It is in every way a city of steel. A real city. New York is many cities at once. Chicago is one city. The blacks from the deep South didn't go to New York, they came to Chicago. And the Irish, and the East Europeans and the Koreans, to make one big steel city. It's no coincidence that the skyscraper came from Chicago. It is the architectural Athens of America.\"</p> <p>The war over, Terkel became involved in radical theatre and radio soap operas, playing bit parts \u2014 \"usually criminals or gangsters\". He also worked as a DJ, playing his favourite music: jazz, blues, folk and opera.</p> <p>With the advent of television, in 1945 Terkel was allocated his own chat show, Studs's Place, set in a Chicago diner, but it was terminated when his political views came to the attention of HUAC, the House Un-American Activities Committee, which shared the anti-communist views of Senator Joseph McCarthy. The committee's veto sent Terkel back to radio. He heard Woody Guthrie on air one day, asked what station he was listening to, and the answer was WMFT. There he went, in 1953, and there he stayed.</p> <p>While celebrities graced his programme, ordinary Americans populated his books. The first publication was Division Street America (1966), about race in Chicago. The white Appalachian hillibillies and the black Mississippi sharecroppers did not meet on the city's streets, but they did in Terkel's book, explaining their views of themselves and of each other.</p> <p>Hard Times (1970) looked back on the Depression. Here were people like Dynamite Garland from Cleveland who eventually found work in a bakery and lived off eclairs that slipped onto the floor (''roaches all over the floor, big roaches''). Although bankrupt and living with her husband and two children in a garage on $14 a week, she nevertheless blew her first $65 on a fur coat. In a similar vein was The Good War (1985), which had Americans look back at their hopes, jokes, fears and survival mechanisms during the second world war.</p> <p>But the most bountiful harvest of humanity had by then been gathered in Working. Terkel won a Pulitzer prize for these stories, like that of Hobart Foote, or Babe Secoli the supermarket checker, who described customers engaged in something less like shopping than dodgem cars with trolleys, and garbage man Nick Salerno, discoursing on his long experience of how people pack their rubbish: \"You get just like the milkman's horse \u2014 used to it.\"</p> <p>In 1981, American Dreams Lost and Found was published, including a remarkable interview with a former president of the Ku Klux Klan, CP Ellis. But shortly afterwards came something of a heresy. The Great Divide: Second Thoughts on the American Dream (1988) was Terkel ill-at-ease, in a book about rifts across society, not just between \"haves, have somewhats and have-nots\", but race and religion.</p> <p>Coming of Age, was something of a valedictory address, not only by its dramatis personae but by Terkel himself. Kurt Vonnegut called its cast of characters \"uncelebrated but undefeated, brave and just Americans whose long lifetimes are likely to expire along with a notoriously disgraceful century\".</p> <p>In its pages, the Americans of an epoch bid their successors farewell - people like Carolyn Peery of Cleveland, aged 99, who remembers her mother in law, \"born into slavery ... jumping up and down saying 'God bless Mr Lincoln. God bless Mr Lincoln!'\".</p> <p>Best of all, Terkel liked the ghost-town storekeeper in Kentucky who says: \"The last flicker of my life will be against something I don't think has to be.\"<br>Terkel commuted from near-northside Chicago to the radio station on what he called the \"Geriatric Express\" bus. He engaged his fellow passengers in conversation, aware that he was often considered \"some old nut\", feeling like \"the Ancient Mariner\" and worried that America is \"starting to suffer from a sort of collective Alzheimer's disease\".</p> <p>But when I met him, Studs's mental agility at the age of 83 was exhausting company. His face was puckish but kind, and flickered between reflection and mischief.</p> <p>He arrived at a club he liked for lunch without the obligatory tie. It was duly kitted out by the girl at reception, and knotted by Terkel around the outside of his jacket collar. He recommended a stiff Stoli Martini to kick off and \"a little wine\" to follow.</p> <p>The journey to and from his office was through a subterranean labyrinth of corridors and shopping arcades linking the WMFT building with the tower containing the luncheon club. Besides the elevator door was an Irish attendant he knew, and they burst into song. Then there was an extraordinary ritual, involving an employee at Johnny's Shoe Shine. \"Another day!\" bellowed Terkel, from quite a distance. \"Another triumph!\" boomed back the reply.</p> <p>Terkel disliked this nether region beneath the skyscrapers. \"It's supposed to tell you that you're just a little cog in a big machine,\" he objected, \"Bring back the man!\"</p> <p>His radio broadcasts finished in 1998, and the following year his wife Ida died after 60 years of happy marriage. But the books continued: two on faith, in 2001 and 2003; two on entertainment - The Spectator: Talk About Movies and Plays With Those Who Make Them (1999) and And They All Sang: Adventures of an Eclectic Disc Jockey (2005); a memoir, Touch and Go (2007); and - still to come - PS Further Thoughts From a Lifetime of Listening. His son Dan survives him.</p> <p>\u2022 Studs (Louis) Terkel, broadcaster and oral historian, born May 16 1912; died October 31 2008</p>",
  "<p>A 200-yard strip of black asphalt curling down a hillside in the suburbs of Sao Paulo is where the fate of Lewis Hamilton's campaign to become the youngest world champion in formula one's history may be decided in the opening seconds of tomorrow's Brazilian grand prix. Plunging left and right before flattening out in a second left-hander, this is the equivalent of the near-vertical ice wall of Kitzb\u00fchel's Steilhang or the off-camber downhill turn that funnels the steaming, panting Gold Cup field into Cheltenham's leg-sapping finishing straight.</p> <p>Hamilton knows that here is where he came to grief last year, when all he had to do to become the first man to win the title in his debut season was to finish in the top three. A poor start set off a train of events that effectively dashed his hopes before the race was half a minute old. As he sits on the start line tomorrow, hearing his engine scream and knowing that he needs only to finish the race in the first five places, he will be experiencing a familiar conflict between prudence and the racer's instincts.</p> <p>If he is on the front row, as he was on his first visit to Interlagos 12 months ago, all he will see from the low-slung cockpit of his McLaren-Mercedes is a brow that marks the turn-in to the circuit's first corner. At 800m or 2,600ft, this is the highest point of any track in the formula one calendar, and the rarefied air will be costing his engine about 10% of its sea-level horsepower. What he sees after he crests that brow, braking and turning left into the first of the rapid succession of curves, is likely to determine the course of the afternoon.</p> <p>Interlagos's Senna esses may not have the scenic splendour of Monaco's Casino Square or the flat-out majesty of Monza's endless Parabolica, but they play a major part in making the 2.6-mile Brazilian track the most likely venue, as the veteran Toyota engineer Frank Dernie observed yesterday, to produce dramatic racing. </p> <p>Time and again since 1990, when formula one left Rio's Jacarepagua circuit and returned to a shortened and reconfigured Interlagos, the course of events has been altered by incidents at the Senna esses. In 1993 Michael Andretti's McLaren hit Gerhard Berger's Ferrari on the opening lap, provoking a spectacular cartwheeling crash. \"I don't remember much about it,\" Berger said yesterday, \"but I know it was his fault.\" </p> <p>Rain makes these corners an even more treacherous proposition. In 2003 a river of water flowed across the track between turns two and three, sending half a dozen cars sliding into the barriers. Turn one also invites the sort of overtaking manoeuvres that bring spectators to their feet, such as Juan Pablo Montoya's audacious outbraking of Michael Schumacher in 2001.</p> <p>Hamilton was reluctant to respond this week to questions about turn one's role tomorrow, although his implied suggestion that it is just another corner carried about as much credibility as his claim to be treating the 2008 Brazilian grand prix as just another race. But David Coulthard, who is ending his 14-year career as a formula one driver here tomorrow, had no hesitation in confirming its significance.</p> <p>\"When there's been carnage at the Brazilian grand prix,\" he said at the circuit yesterday, \"it's usually been at one of those three corners. They are very challenging. I've crashed at turn one at the start of a grand prix, I've crashed at turn two in the middle of a damp grand prix, and even Michael Schumacher managed to crash in the wet on the exit of turn three.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow there will be the start of a world championship-deciding grand prix, and there's going to be a lot of emotion. You're going to have Lewis trying desperately to keep out of trouble, you've going to have Felipe [Massa] desperately trying to get the lead, and everyone else apart from maybe Kimi [Raikkonen], who probably doesn't care, and myself, who definitely cares about getting through the first corner, is just going to be thinking, 'This is the end of the season - go for it.'\"</p> <p>As he sets off on the parade lap, Hamilton and his engineers will note the amount of grip provided by the surface. While he works at getting his tyres and brakes up to their operating temperatures, he will be getting instructions from the pit wall on which clutch setting and how many engine revs to use in order to produce the most efficient compromise between bite and slip. As he noses the car back into its grid slot and holds it stationary against the uphill gradient, his heartbeat will be rising to around 180 a minute.</p> <p>When he gets it right, Hamilton is as effective a starter as any of his rivals. But there have been costly mistakes. At Interlagos a year ago, after a sluggish getaway dropped him from second place on the grid to fourth as they went through the esses, he responded at the end of the back straight with a rash counterattack on Fernando Alonso that sent him off the road and cost a further four places. In Bahrain this year he inadvertently omitted part of his pre-launch procedure on the parade lap and made a mess of trying to compensate for the error.</p> <p>And, as the two most recent races have demonstrated, a good start remains vital to Hamilton's prospects. In Japan, where he found himself shuffled back into the pack, a stubborn vestige of immaturity exposed itself. In China a week later he took off from pole position and drove serenely away from his pursuers. </p> <p>If he sets the fastest time in today's qualifying session and gets a clean getaway from pole position tomorrow, Hamilton will be in fourth gear and doing close to 150mph by the time he has completed the 300-yard dash from the start line to the turn-in for the first corner, probably moving to the centre of the track to discourage rivals from stealing the inside line as 20 cars try to occupy the same piece of road.</p> <p>\"The track doesn't actually get any narrower,\" Coulthard said, \"but what gives you that impression is the fact that as you brake into the corner it's slightly cambered down to the left and the old circuit continues on way beyond, straight ahead. It's a late apex, so you're turning, turning, turning - and inevitably with such a late apex the door is open for a long time, which invites people to come down your inside. It's also easy to lock up the front wheels and overshoot the turn because the corner's dropping away from you.\" </p> <p>If Hamilton makes it through turn one unscathed, he will floor the throttle through the right-handed turn two, changing up through the gears and hurling the car into the long, smooth profile of the left-handed turn three. </p> <p>As the road flattens out and the car accelerates towards 200mph on the long back straight, he will see the tower blocks of Sao Paulo on the horizon. And if that is all he can see, he will tell himself that he is on his way to the title.</p>",

Now it is in liquidation - leaving 7,000 employees in shock. </p> <p>\"One day we went to work as usual, the next it was all closed,\" said Wei Sunying, at the gate of the factory in Dongguan, southern China, where she spent eight years painting plastic components in a fume-filled room.</p> <p>\"Thousands of us are looking for jobs now. We walk around every day till our feet ache but we can't find anything.\"</p> <p>Few in the west have heard of Dongguan, but the chances are that your shoes, your TV or your children's toys originated here. Exports have built a city of 14 million inhabitants, almost all migrant workers from the countryside. Its economy has sustained 15% annual growth in recent years. The global economic crisis is proving the final straw for exporters punished by rising costs and stronger currency.</p> <p>In the past year, chill winds have blown through the Pearl River Delta. Sixty-seven thousand small firms collapsed in the first half of 2008, many in these manufacturing heartlands, says the national economic planning body. Toy firms have been particularly badly hit, by safety scares and product recalls. Textile firms, with wafer-thin margins, are also reeling. Next came tighter credit for many foreign-owned firms, like Hong Kong's Smart Union. And then, in the past two months, a sharp drop in US and European consumer demand. </p> <p>A local trade association predicts that by late January, Dongguan and its neighbours Shenzhen and Guangzhou will lose 9,000 of their 45,000 factories. </p> <p>\"Many factories are looking at completely empty order books,\" warned Stephen Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered, who believes the export sector may even shrink next year. Green believes China will see 7.9% growth in 2009 - well below the double digit figures of the past five years.</p> <p>That may sound enviable to western countries facing recession, but with the working age population still growing, China needs to grow by at least 8% to maintain its employment rate. The fall-out will be concentrated in provinces such as Guangdong.</p> <p>\"The social impact of this is going to be huge. The problems are getting bigger and bigger,\" said Wooyeal Paik, researching Dongguan's industry and migrant workforce at the University of California at Los Angeles.</p> <p>\"Disgruntled workers left jobless will complain more ... You will see demonstrations and picketing. And probably there's a risk of violence against bosses - especially foreigners.\"</p> <p>Dongguan's government stepped in to reimburse the Smart Union workers to the tune of 24m yuan (\u00a32.2m) after thousands gathered at the factory gates and outside local authority offices. But two month's back pay - 1,200 yuan for most - will not last long. Wei, from Guizhou, is one of many struggling to find work. \"I came here as a migrant worker because my children need money for schooling,\" she said. New job offers aren't always what they seem, added 26-year-old Fang Jianlin, whose friends were recently conned. </p> <p>\"Recruiters told them the salaries were very good, but they were asked for money. They got robbed; some were even beaten,\" he said.</p> <p>Smart Union was such a popular employer that Fang paid a hefty \"introduction fee\" to get his job there. At worst, he and his wife would earn about 600 yuan a month; at the busiest times, when production ran until 2am, they could take home 2,100 yuan each.</p> <p>It's a tragic end to the dream which lures millions of workers to Dongguan each year, where they struggle and study their way towards the promise of a regular income. At the city's night schools, thousands of workers end their days with classes on every subject from car maintenance to law. Bob Li is one of the success stories. He arrived in 1995 as a labourer; \"everyone in my hometown had heard Guangdong was covered in gold,\" he explained.</p> <p>Now he manages a factory for Richall, supplying durable bags to companies such as Walmart, Carlsberg and Disney. He is unnerved by the economic downturn. \"These days it is getting more and more difficult for factories like us,\" he said, citing the cost of wages and materials. \"The price of our materials has risen because they're made from oil ... Taken together, costs have risen by 30-40%.\"</p> <p>To some extent, Dongguan has become a victim of its own success. The rising prosperity of the region has created inflationary pressures. Workers want higher wages; new labour laws are designed to wipe out sweatshops that bring higher costs which squeeze many companies. Manufacturers have already fled inland to cheaper provinces, in many cases encouraged by Guangdong authorities, who hoped to move the province up the value chain - condensing two hundred years of western industrial development into fewer than 15. </p> <p>\"We have a policy to empty the cage for the new birds,\" Guangdong's vice-governor Wan Qingliang told reporters this month. \"The ultimate target is to build the Pearl River Delta into the core region of modern manufacturing.\" </p> <p>Others are unsure of the wisdom of the policy in the face of a worldwide downturn. \"Places like Guangdong miscalculated the development of the economy. They actually tried to push out those labour intensive and small and medium sized enterprises [SMEs] out of the [established industrial] area because they wanted hi-tech industries there. But when something bad happens, like the economic downturn, what are they going to do?\" said Paik. He acknowledges that numerous east Asian economies have moved up the value chain in the same way, and that the Chinese government deserves to be confident given its economic record. \"But they haven't experienced a serious economic downturn except right after 1989 and have been overconfident in their policy of the quick transformation of industrial structure toward hi-tech in Guangdong,\" he cautioned. The risk is that officials might push the city off the economic ladder rather than up it. Whether subsidies, tax rebates and other support for small firms can save them remains to be seen.</p> <p>Yet China's rising living standards in the 30 years since economic reforms were launched has left most people optimistic about its long-term prospects. Migrant workers returning home think they may come back in a few years.</p> <p>\"If we compare the situation to when I first arrived, I have already found my pot of gold,\" said Bob Li. \"But I can still see it's just the beginning.\"</p>",

  "<p>\"Welcome to The Border Inn\", reads the sign in Philip Ross's hands. A nice touch, but not entirely necessary. He is wearing a fleece printed with huskies. Even without the dogs emblazoned across his chest, we would have clocked him at Kuusamo airport immediately. He stands stock still amid a gaggle of over-excited ski reps, who flirt with each other and brandish clipboards at new arrivals. As they shepherd their charges into coaches bound for the ski resort of Ruka, we jump into Philip's 4x4, destination: somewhere near the Russian border. </p> <p>Perhaps the husky sweatshirt is ironic, I think, as we head east along an arrow straight, icy road. But it soon becomes clear that dog sledding is not just a livelihood for Philip, it's an all-consuming obsession. He talks of nothing else. The journey passes quickly with tales of arduous sled races, a rundown of the individual characteristics of (almost) all of his 67 dogs and reminiscences about dogs he's loved and lost. </p> <p>An hour later, ensconced in the pine-clad basement of The Border Inn, Philip's home and our base for the week, the first thing he does is switch on the telly. \"There's something I want to show you,\" he says. It's a video of him dog sledding. With a Boney M soundtrack. </p> <p>Well, there's no doubting the man's authenticity. Which is reassuring when you're about to set off on a four-day dog-sledding expedition into the wild. The plan is to travel in a big loop, averaging 30-35km a day and spending the night in remote cabins. But first we have to get naked. </p> <p>Philip; his friend Ant, a former client who loved the experience so much he came back to help out; young Rob, whose parents gave him the trip as an 18th birthday present; my boyfriend, Rory; and Richard, a retired architect, all pile into the sauna. I'm invited to sauna with Philip's wife, Mira, and their two young daughters. I try to hide my awkwardness at meeting someone for the first time starkers, and make small talk in the 100C heat. </p> <p>The next morning, we pull on our snowsuits for the first time and head out to meet the dogs. There are traditional white huskies with piercing blue eyes, but also smaller, black Norwegian huskies, and grandest of all, gorgeous Freddy, the top dog, half setter, half Siberian husky. The dogs are adorable, bright-eyed, sleek-coated and frisky. They snarl at each other but are pushovers with people.</p> <p>Father Christmas-style sleds are dragged out of storage and the dogs are let out of their enclosures. Thirty-five huskies charge towards us, barking, yelping, howling and haring up and down the driveway like they're on doggy speed. It's chaos. The four of us are introduced to our own teams and handed a bundle of harnesses. </p> <p>This is the moment I realise that behind Philip's gruffness is a sense of humour. My boyfriend's team includes three sisters: Wibble, Wobble and Wu. I am laughing so much watching him race around the yard, shouting \"Wibble! Wobble! Wu!\", that I can barely hold on to the dogs, let alone harness them up. </p> <p>After what feels like hours, the dogs are paired and matched to their sleds and we're ready to roll. They are making even more of a racket now, straining on the ropes. Finally, we get the signal from Philip, I raise my foot, the sled hurtles forward, the canine chorus abates, and we're off. </p> <p>Silence. We fly out of the gate and into the forest and suddenly I get it. It's the most amazing feeling, gliding through this fairytale land where everything is pure and white and glittery. The world looks like it's been frozen forever. The fir trees are tall and crisp and splendid in their white coats, the branches sparkling like Christmas decorations. It's hard to imagine that the spell will be broken and that the snow-laden trees glinting in the sun or the frozen lakes as smooth and delectable as icing will ever defrost and come back to life. </p> <p>The practice run lasts an hour and much to our surprise, no-one falls off. When it's time to turn back I feel like a kid who doesn't want to go home for tea - I want to stay out and play in this wonderland. But we head back to the lodge, where Mira is preparing reindeer stew with lingenberries. It's the only time we see reindeer during the entire week.</p> <p>Day two is the big one - the start of our adventure. We take the bare necessities, most of which are blocks of frozen meat for the dogs, although I'm pleased to see beer and wine count as necessities. Same routine: the dogs go bonkers, barking for 45 minutes until we finally set off. The sled jerks forward and whoosh, we're weaving through the forest and out onto the empty expanse of the lake.</p> <p>Each of us drives our own sled, pulled by six dogs. We travel in single file, with Philip up ahead, dead cool, smoking and listening to his iPod. I wonder what's on it. Boney M? Motivational music for mushers? For the rest of us, the world is silent, as if someone's pressed the mute button. It is utterly, unnervingly still too. There's no breeze, nothing moves, not even the spindliest twig. </p> <p>The track varies, at times cutting through woods where we duck low branches, then out again into the emptiness; occasionally, we come to a hill and have to get off the sleds and run behind, jumping back on just in time before it hurtles down the other side, the wind bringing tears to our eyes. The air is so cold and fresh it smells of metal. </p> <p>After four hours we turn into a wood, and find ourselves outside a log cabin. Inside it's as snug and inviting as Goldilocks'. We're knackered. Standing on the back of a sled for four hours is surprisingly tiring. But chores come first - it's down to the lake to collect water. If Bear Grylls were here he'd probably crack the ice with his bare hands, and have a quick dip for good measure. We bore down with a giant drill and fill two old milk pails with the brown-coloured but clean water. Standing in the middle of the lake, I wonder aloud what it looks like in summer. \"Where there's trees, that's woods, and where there ain't no trees, that's water,\" comes Ant's retort. Stupid question, I guess. </p> <p>The \"bedroom\", with a double bed and a bunk on top, is just off the dining room table. It's spacious compared with the cubby hole in the eaves above the sauna that Richard has to sleep in. He emerges the next morning pink faced - he's been slow-cooked in his sleeping bag overnight. </p> <p>Philip's three favourite dogs are allowed into the cabin; they curl up on the floor, doubling up as foot warmers. With six of us, the three dogs, the sauna fired up, candles lit and dinner on the go, the cabin soon heats up until it's positively steamy and we start to shed layers. The guys troop into the sauna, and out 20 minutes later dripping sweat. There's not a whole lot to do in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. You can go ice-fishing with a comedy, Noddy-sized rod and toddler-sized stool - and a lot of patience. The likelihood of a bite seems miniscule. Or you can eat, convinced you need to double your normal calorie-intake to stave off the cold. No sooner have we scoffed tea and hotdogs on our arrival, than dinner is served, massive plates of pasta or curry or stew. </p> <p>The next day I wake up freezing. It's -7 outside and -5 inside. Cold, but not cold enough, according to Philip. The ideal for dog racing is -20 - warmer weather makes the dogs lethargic. </p> <p>The temperature seems to slow us down, too. It takes us about four hours to get ready - about three of which involve us getting dressed, layer upon thermal layer, until we're wrapped up like Michelin men and bumble out of the cabin. We eventually set off at midday. Hello, white world! A day driving the sleds has made us more confident, but no more adept. One by one, we fall off. At one point I turn round to see an empty ghost-sled flying through the forest, with Richard nowhere to be seen. He emerges five minutes later cadging a lift with Ant. Rounding a corner, I tip over into a snow drift, and lie there flailing like an upturned beetle. Watson, Sherlock and the rest of my dog team are long gone. I lollop after them in knee-deep snow. </p> <p>Our second lodge is a pretty dove-grey cabin. It too is like something out of a storybook. Five single beds in a row pull down from the wall but instead of the three bears, the six of us and the dogs have to squeeze onto the beds. Cosy is the operative word. Someone snores until they're prodded and told to shut up. I wake up to the sight of Ant's naked backside a few feet from my face. \"Morning!\" he chimes. </p> <p>Bare bums are less alarming than the smell of the dogs. Three large dogs, a protein rich diet, small enclosed space . . . I'll spare you the details, but it's not pleasant. Outside, where the rest of the pack lie chained up in pairs, the snow is far from pure. I walk around with a scarf wrapped round my face until we're well away and back in the wilderness where all is pure and clean. Philip thinks I'm a complete wuss.</p> <p>Once we're on the way, the dogs know exactly where they're going. Thank goodness. It would be impossible to navigate your way through this nothingness. There are no distinguishing features, just mile upon mile of white under a grey sky. Occasionally we come across a wooden border post marking the frontier with Russia, and on the third day we spot a lookout post but see no guards. In fact, we see no one, full stop. And no wildlife, bar the occasional snow grouse and a lone woodpecker. </p> <p>On the final day, we pass through a wooded area that Philip has dubbed the Martian Army, where the snow is particularly thick on the trees, making them look like strange creatures marching up and over the hill. It's spectacularly pretty but also slightly sinister, as if the trees are closing in on us. We stop for photos but don't hang around. Instead we career downhill on our way back to the main lodge, almost taking off as we gather speed. </p> <p>To welcome us back, Mira has prepared a celebratory meal - lamb fillets and red wine. The conversation, of course, is about the dogs. Philip's off again, going over the details of next weekend's race, the gruelling 320km Pasvik Trail. But this time, I listen and understand why he is so excited, for I too want to experience once more the lurch of the sled and the thrill of being pulled into that soundless, white world.</p> <h2>Way to go</h2> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>A seven-night dog sledding trip from The Border Inn (<a href=\"http://www.theborderinn.com\">theborderinn.com</a>) costs \u00a31,350pp land only, inc all food and equipment, available between December 21 2008 and April 19 2009, through Spirit of Adventure (01822 88027, <a href=\"http://www.spirit-of-adventure.com\">spirit-of-adventure.com</a>).

In a blunt and angry letter to justice department lawyers, Willett spelled out what he thought of the way the men had been treated.</p> <p>\"After years of stalling and staying and appellate gamesmanship, you pleaded no contest - they are not enemy combatants,\" Willett has written. \"You have never charged them with any crime.\" </p> <p>Last month a federal judge ruled that the men should be freed. \"They were on freedom's doorstep,\" said Willett. \"The plane was at Gitmo. The stateside Lutheran refugee services and the Uighur families and Tallahassee clergy were ready to receive them.\" However, the justice department appealed against the ruling and Willett claims this will put the men into a potentially endless limbo. </p> <p>Yesterday Willett said his clients were \"saddened\" by the latest events. The men, who are Muslims, were in Afghanistan in 2001 and were captured by Pakistani troops and handed over to the US. So far, more than 100 countries have been asked to take them as refugees but none have agreed. Willett blamed US authorities for incorrectly describing them as terrorists. </p> <p>According to the US justice department, the men \"are linked to an organisation that the state department has labelled to be a terrorist entity, and it is beside the point that the organisation is not 'a threat to us' because the law excluding members of such groups does not require such proof.\" </p> <p>Willett is also angry the defence department will not agree to let him meet his clients unless they are chained to the floor. He called for this restriction to be lifted: \"Just permit these men one shred of human dignity.\" He added: \"Americans are not supposed to treat enemy prisoners of war this way under the service field manuals, or the Geneva conventions - if anyone paid attention to the field manuals or the Geneva conventions anymore.\"</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\">Lewis Hamilton</a> will be inspired by the memory of Ayrton Senna as he bids to become Britain's ninth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">formula one</a> world champion in 50 years in Brazil tomorrow. </p> <p>Hamilton said he could not be compared to the great Brazilian but would aim \"to make him proud\" when he goes head to head for the title with Felipe Massa. \"This is my second time here in Brazil, and each time I've touched down I've felt a different emotion. It's because he [Senna] meant so much to me in my life when I was younger, coming up through the ranks,\" he said. \"I can still feel his presence, so to be mentioned in the same sentence as him is an honour. I don't aim to be, nor do I believe anyone can be, another Ayrton Senna. He was one of a kind. But I aim to try to make him proud and be as good as he was one day.\"</p> <p>Hamilton is determined that his sporting rivalry with Massa, who he leads by seven points in the drivers championship, will not spill over into personal animosity at Interlagos.\"For me everything is cool,\" said Hamilton. \" I don't try to be anything different and I don't act different. Things are cool with him and I respect him.\"</p> <p>Asked if he actually liked Massa, Hamilton said: \"Yeah, he is a cool guy. We are fighting for the championship but that doesn't change things off the track.\" </p> <p>Hamilton finished fourth fastest at the end of yesterday's free practice sessions, which were dominated by Massa until Fernando Alonso set the fastest time in his Renault. \"I am happy for the weekend to take its time,\" Hamilton said. \"I have come a long, long way so just to wish it to go quickly is not the way forward.\" </p> <p>Hamilton insisted he would approach the most important race of the season in the same pragmatic fashion as he tackled the previous 17, even though Massa will have the advantage of racing in front of his home crowd. \"You just do the same as you do every other race,\" he said. \"You approach it the same as every race. This is the pinnacle. This is the crown. This would be the biggest achievement but I have plenty of time to do it. It's not like it's my last year.\"</p> <h2>Final race showdowns: When the whole season goes down to the wire</h2> <p><strong>1950</strong></p> <p>Farina v Fagioli v Fangio</p> <p><strong>Italian GP Monza September 3</strong></p> <p>Alfa Romeo had dominated the season of the inaugural world championship. Their three drivers - Giuseppe Farina, Luigi Fagioli and Juan Manuel Fangio - were locked in a fight for the title, all driving the 158 Alfetta cars. The race was won by Farina, his third win from the seven races that season, and so became the first official world champion.</p> <p><strong>1958</strong></p> <p>Hawthorn v Moss</p> <p><strong>Moroccan GP</strong> <strong>Casablanca October 19</strong></p> <p>Mike Hawthorn was running third in his Ferrari but needed to be second if he was to become Britain's first world champion by one point from Stirling Moss who dominated this race in his Vanwall. Phil Hill, running second in the other Ferrari, waved Hawthorn through to allow him to claim the championship. It was Hawthorn's last race. He had already announced his retirement but three months later, on January 22 1959, he died in an accident on the A3 Guildford bypass.</p> <p><strong>1964</strong></p> <p>Clark v Hill v Surtees</p> <p><strong>Mexican GP Mexico City October 25</strong></p> <p>A three-way shoot-out between Jim Clark, Graham Hill and John Surtees was resolved on the final lap when Clark's engine blew up and Lorenzo Bandini, in the other Ferrari, let former motorcycle ace Surtees through to take the title. Hill finished a disappointing 11th but still took second place in the standings, Surtees is still the only person to have to won world championships on both two and four wheels. </p> <p><strong>1984</strong></p> <p>Prost v Lauda</p> <p><strong>Portuguese GP Estoril October 21</strong></p> <p>Alain Prost led the race throughout to score his seventh win of the season, but his McLaren team-mate Niki Lauda followed him home second to take the championship by the wafer-thin margin of half a point - half points were then awarded for races which were stopped before halfway - the closest finish in the record book.</p> <p><strong>1994</strong></p> <p>Schumacher v Hill</p> <p><strong>Australian GP Adelaide November 13 </strong></p> <p>To this day most British fans believe that Michael Schumacher, who went into the race with a single-point lead, deliberately collided with Damon Hill's Williams. Schumacher hit a barrier in his Benetton at 155mph knocking him out of the race, but ran into Hill who attempted to continue but was forced to retire with a broken front-left suspension. The incident allowed Schumacher to win the first of his seven championships. <strong>Alan Henry</strong></p>",
  "<p>So as we reach the finish line: John McCain's pollster declares himself satisfied that the race is functionally tied in the important states; Barack Obama says \"we're winning\"; while liberals across the US speak fretfully in the subjunctive tense, daring not to tempt fate by saying anything like \"when Obama is president\".</p> <p>Are the liberal caution and the McCain quasi-optimism actually warranted? Is there any way the Republican could still win this thing?</p> <p>The answer mathematically is... yes, he could. And it needn't even hinge on eking out a win in Pennsylvania. </p> <p>Consider the following electoral-college permutations. Obama wins all the states John Kerry won in 2004, for 252 electoral votes, along with Iowa and New Mexico, two states where he appears to be comfortably ahead and would add 12 to his total for 264 (270 is needed to win). But suppose it stops there and every other battleground state tumbles toward McCain - Ohio and Florida, where Obama's leads are fairly narrow, but also Virginia and Colorado, where his leads are larger but not insurmountable. These are, after all, states that are long accustomed to backing the Republican candidate. In this scenario, McCain wins 274-264.</p> <p>Let's go it one better. Say McCain does manage a victory in Pennsylvania, where his campaign is circulating fliers comparing him to Hillary Clinton, that seductress of the state's oft-limned blue-collar voters. If he did snare that state's 21 electoral votes, McCain could then afford to lose Virginia (13) and Colorado (nine). Still holding Ohio, Florida etc, he would win 273-265.</p> <p>Let's try one final scenario. Penn-sylvania ends up in the Obama column, as does Colorado. But McCain's pollster has recent spoken of mysterious \"internal numbers\" showing Iowa (seven votes) to be somewhat up for grabs. So an electoral cocktail that includes Iowa and Virginia but not Pennsylvania or Colorado would give McCain 272 electoral votes and the presidency.</p> <p>Though mathematically possible, how likely are any of these scenarios?</p> <p>Throughout this election, I've relied most regularly on the websites RealClearPolitics and fivethirtyeight.com for polling averages, so let's see what they have to say about the margins in these states as of yesterday. In Pennsylvania, both have Obama ahead by 9.8%. Making up 10% in four days would be a remarkable feat, though not unheard of. Obama is six points ahead in Virginia and Colorado, and has a 11% lead in Iowa. Now let's recall that all the above scenarios are possible only if McCain wins Ohio. In what we call the Buckeye state, the websites have Obama ahead by about 5%.</p> <p>McCain doesn't have a lead in any major poll in any of these states. He would truly need a tsunami to hit that would shift the race in his direction by five to 10 points in the final days - a swing very nearly without precedent. </p> <p>But still, Obama supporters' emotional continuum runs from cautious to outright neurotic. Liberal election anxiety is grounded in the hard experiences of 2000 and 2004. We tend to assume that any mention by the Republicans of \"taxes\", \"terrorism\" and \"socialism\" will send middle America dashing fearfully into their arms. We suspect that those same Americans will wake next Tuesday morning and say to themselves: \"It's just now dawned on me that that fellow is black; I can't possibly vote for him.\"</p> <p>The former hasn't happened, and the latter is increasingly implausible. As the days dwindle down to a precious few, as Maxwell Anderson put it, caution is well-advised. But neurosis would seem to be an indulgence. It's a good thing that the candidate himself doesn't suffer from it.</p> <p>\u2022 Read Michael Tomasky's blog and watch his video commentary at theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday November 5 2008.

  "<p>It's all a bit like a game, a fancy fantasy; except for the fact that I'm actually on board, what are the chances that I am going to set sail as an underage stowaway on an enormous luxury liner? </p> <p>It reminds me of amusement park rides where you have to be a certain height before they let you pass Go, and because you want it so badly, you try to get away with it knowing you're going to come up short. And then every time, the ticket guy looks the other way and suddenly you're in - you're driving a go-kart, which is great except for the fact that you're still two inches too short and you can't reach the pedal and so you're stopping and starting and everyone thinks you're either mental or have serious engine trouble.</p> <p>\"More tea?\" she asks. \"Or would you rather champagne?\" I say nothing. She pops a bottle of bubbly and I figure why not, and knock back the whole glass in a couple of swift gulps - I had no idea I was so thirsty. From the way she's acting I get the sense that, in her mind, it's entirely plausible that she might take me under her wing or her enormous skirts. I have yet to find out her name, so in my mind I call her Mrs Butterworth because she looks like the woman I once saw on a syrup bottle - old-fashioned and round.</p> <p>We have tea and the petit fours from the wedding, supplemented by strawberries dipped in chocolate and the rest of the bottle of champagne. The three dogs are at our feet, dancing on their hind legs, begging. Their weightless paws like the thinnest of fingers tickling. Mrs Butterworth keeps saying, \"You poor, poor laddie, what you must have been through, don't worry it's all over now baby, a new page is turning.\" And I'm thinking she's got a pretty strong fantasy of her own about who I am and where I've been. Given that I am on an empty stomach, the combination of sugar and drink goes right to my head and I can't think of what to say to dissuade her. A good part of me is crying out \"game over, game over\", and wishing the ride would end, but I'm losing my ability to stand or move at all. Suddenly, the ship's twin whistles blow, there are cheers and horns and she whisks me out on deck. As the ship pulls away from the shore, my stomach leaves me spilling sick on to the spotless deck. The three Chihuahuas charge out of the door rushing towards the sick, the rapid rhythm of their toenails singing \"snack, snack, snack\". Mrs Butterworth quickly snatches their leashes, jerking them off the ground by their necks - their feet uselessly kicking the air, and before they are hanged, she's scooped them, coughing, sputtering, gagging to her breast.</p> <p>\"First time setting sail?\" she asks, ushering me back into the room, leading me to the head. I rinse my mouth while she calls housekeeping and asks them to send someone with a mop and bucket. I can't tell what's redder, my face or the rose in the vase by the sink. \"Terribly sorry,\" I say when I've recovered sufficiently to come out. \"I think it was the champagne.\"</p> <p>\"You poor, poor laddie,\" she starts in again, this time wiping my brow with her handkerchief, which reeks of perfume. I pull away quickly and duck out on to the balcony. She follows me, and together with the dogs we watch as the shoreline recedes, the sun sets and land is soon defined by tiny lights like pinheads. Suddenly, it's no game.</p> <p> \"How long can we remain strangers?\" she says, putting out her hand. \"Sally Williamson Walker Warburton,\" she says. \"I have a fondness for gentlemen whose names have a W.\"</p> <p>I bow and introduce myself.</p> <p>\"Are you a native of Southampton? A little orphan boy looking for adventure?\"</p> <p>\"London,\" I say.</p> <p>\"Where you live in run-down public housing with an older man, a distant cousin, who has too many cats?\"</p> <p>I shake my head. \"Knotting Hill.\"</p> <p>She looks confused. \"And how did you get here?\"</p> <p>\"I was at Hinxted Hall for a wedding that was called off, and from there I hitched a lift.\"</p> <p>Her face falls. I fear I have disappointed her. I am not her fantasy scruffian rescued off the street. \"But I am actually an orphan,\" I say, and to my surprise as I'm saying it, I am actually overcome by grief. \"I never knew my dad, and my mum died two years ago and left me with her friend, who was supposed to marry this guy, who then would have been my dad, but then at the last minute it all fell apart.\" I am about to go on, but suddenly cannot.</p> <p>\"It is a sad story,\" she says, slightly suspicious.</p> <p>\"It's not a story,\" I say, taking off my shoe and showing her my reduced volume of Tania's Big Book of Life, and extracting not just a laminated photograph of her but also her obituary, reduced and preserved between sheets of plastic. At the same time out falls my school identification card, the name of which she recognises all too quickly. \"It would appear that none of us are quite who we seem.\" </p> <p>\"My grandfather's legacy,\" I say, knowing I have been exposed. \"He was a RAF pilot shot down in the war,\" which is what my mother always told me, but there are times, recently when it's occurred to me that there might be more to the story than that. I am slightly nervous, not knowing what the terms of my employment are, and am wishing I had my beloved troll in my pocket - to calm myself I usually twist his green hair - but now am left with no device to worry myself with. I get down on my knees before the dogs and pray. \"It's not where you come from but where you are going that counts,\" I say.</p> <p>\"Hmmm,\" she says.</p> <p>There is a knock at the door, the dogs bark, the man asks does she want them taken down below to the kennel?</p> <p>\"Is that an offer or a threat?\"</p> <p>\"Pardon?\"</p> <p>\"These are working dogs, therapy animals, they have certificates and papers and they are to remain with me at all times, except, of course, when being walked by my travelling companion ...\" She looks at me to fill the blank. \"Blank,\" I say, coming to attention to shake the fellow's hand. \"Obie Blank.\"</p>",
  "<p>Simon Schama is many things: widely ranging historian, art critic, public intellectual, television don. For some, he's a bit too flashy, with a prose style glittering (at times) with fake jewels. On the other hand, a wide audience finds in him a rare form of intellectual entertainment, at once provocative and informative. As usual, in his latest multimedia production he swerves from past to present with staggering dexterity. The television series is already under way, so how does it do as a book?</p> <p>Few writers can summon an era so well, or so briskly, with a telling anecdote or well-phrased aside. His unwieldy subject here is the US itself, where he has spent a good deal of his adult life, and which he understands deeply. Yet this book remains elusive. In many ways, it's a sequence of riffs on American history accompanied by heady intimations of where things are going, and where they might go.</p> <p>He opens with jaw-dropping audacity, saying he knows exactly when American democracy came back from the dead: on January 3 2008, during the Iowa caucus. He was there, he tells us: almost a spoof on the eyewitness account. We know what he means: that the rise of Barack Obama has had something to do with a resurgence of grassroots democracy. But he might as well have chosen any number of other anticipatory moments, such as the unlikely emergence of Howard Dean in 2004. </p> <p>Schama likes a good story. History, for him, is narrative, although he insists that we should \"retire the word 'narrative' - from graduate student courses; political analysts; image doctors; from anyone who doesn't actually narrate\". Despite this remark, Schama narrates with gusto. And his narratives are not just one damn thing after another (to quote Arnold Toynbee); instead, he makes elaborate links, finding the plots in history, its hidden and necessary connections.</p> <p>An enthusiast for Obama, Schama turns his hero into a narrative historian, something like himself: \"When Obama spoke of wanting to replace the partisan division of 'Red States' and 'Blue States' with a recovered United States, it was impossible not to remember Thomas Jefferson's inaugural, after the bitter election of 1800 that (after 39 ballots of the House of Representatives) finally brought him to power.\" This is, perhaps, the proper role of the historian: to bring past and present together, using the one to illuminate the other.</p> <p>Surprises abound in Schama's work. I recall a passage in Landscape and Memory (1995), perhaps his finest book, where he summons a vision of the pristine \"brilliant meadow floor\" of Yosemite. It seemed a kind of Eden to the European eyes that first encountered it, God's dream of paradise; yet it was the product of systematic fire-clearances by the Ahwahneechee Indians who lived there long ago. What you think you see is often not what you get.</p> <p>This larger truth applies nicely to American history. For instance, Schama opens one section with a quotation from Dick Cheney: \"America has never been a warrior culture.\" Like hell we haven't. Schama makes his point by following one American family, the Meigs, who appear always to have had someone on the field of battle. We hear about one Montgomery Meigs, who had worked with young Robert E Lee in the summer of 1837 on the Mississippi, surveying the river. When Lee eventually took up arms against the union, Meigs took it personally. His descendent, General Monty Meigs, appeared at the White House in 2006 to brief Dick Cheney, George W Bush and Donald Rumsfeld about the dire situation on the ground in Iraq. This is history by example, channelling large abstractions into particular illustrations. </p> <p>Schama revels in ironies, as in his shrewd meditations on immigration, where he points out that the US, while a nation of immigrants, has always taken a dim view of those currently aspiring to citizenship. There has been a persistent fear of losing one's identity in the melting pot. Schama, the son of Jewish refugees, has a gut understanding of what it means to feel displaced, and how difficult assimilation can be. </p> <p>In a section called \"American Fervour\", he contemplates the curious passion that has underscored the American experience for generations, taking many forms - religious or political. There is always that search for the Promised Land, a place where all will be well. \"The American future is all vision,\" Schama writes, \"numinous, unformed, light-headed with anticipation\". As ever, he revels in the contrast between this visionary gleam and the dark past that weighs it down. </p> <p>This ragged, brilliant, hopscotching volume of vaguely connected essays is largely about America's myth of its own exceptionalism, the belief that somehow the American will must triumph in the world. The appeal as well as the ruthlessness of this vision comes through in these pages. I was left feeling rather chilled by Schama's take on the US and its prospects. This may be the end of an empire as we knew it, and one can only wonder what it will mean for someone like Obama to preside over its dismantling - or its transformation. </p> <p>\u2022 Jay Parini's forthcoming book is Promised Land: Thirteen Books That Changed America (Doubleday)</p>",
  "<p>The day we brought my new-born son home to our Brooklyn apartment, an article in the New York Times pointed out that \"a black male who drops out of high school [in the US] is 60 times more likely to find himself in prison than one with a bachelor's degree\". These are the kind of statistics I often quote in my work. But this time it was personal. Looking down at him as he snoozed in the brand new car seat, I thought: \"Those are not great odds. I'd better buy some more children's books.\"</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, as we fumbled with the nappies, pram, barfing and burping, a new, previously unthinkable option for black American males emerged: the presidency of the United States. Osceola was born on the weekend Barack Obama declared his candidacy. This prompted conversations that I would not have had otherwise. His success, I was told, would signify great things for my son. Osceola would grow up with an assumption that the highest office in the land was open to him. That the future could be his. That there was, I was told, nothing that this child could not achieve. </p> <p>Back in February 2007, when Obama announced his candidacy, this never made much sense to me. The fact that my son suddenly has a tiny theoretical chance of getting to the White House is less important than the more real chance of his ending up behind bars (one in three black American boys born in 2001 will do so) or dead (three black kids are shot every day). I wanted a president who could change the odds for the many rather than raise the stakes for a few. I didn't care what they looked like. It wasn't that I didn't understand the symbolic importance of his bid. I just did not want to mistake it for substance.</p> <p>On a political level, I have always thought he was interesting. Obama's announcement came 18 months after hurricane Katrina put black America's collective deprivation and individual success clearly on display. One man can rise to the presidency and a whole community can sink into the Gulf of Mexico: anything, I thought, really is possible. And with three days to go before election day, it looks like the US stands on the verge of making the historic decision to put a black man in the White House.</p> <p>This was no reflection on Obama. Everything I'd heard about him - not least his opposition to the Iraq war at a time when such a position was unpopular - was impressive. But his two years in the Senate suggested he was pretty mainstream and even, at times, a little suspect. He'd supported Joseph Lieberman (a Democrat who is now supporting John McCain) in his primary Senate campaign against an anti-war campaigner. And he voted to confirm Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state. It wasn't obvious to me that he would be any better than some other generic Democrat with different pigmentation. The idea that his presidency would mean anything for Osceola's life never really crossed my mind.</p> <p>To express such scepticism before many Obama supporters was to be accused of cynicism. The true believers do not just want you to drink the Kool Aid. They demand that you chug it.</p> <p>The people my scepticism vexed most were white liberals. Obama had become prey to the soft bigotry of unreasonable expectations. Describing the crowd's reaction to him in Rockford, Illinois, Time's Joe Klein noted: \"The African Americans tend to be fairly reserved ... The white people, by contrast, are out of control.\" They had found a black politician they felt comfortable with, and wanted him to be everything: Martin Luther King, John F Kennedy, a griot, president, vice-president, motherhood and apple pie. They prattled on about a post-racial America as though the Jena Six never happened and Sean Bell, a unarmed black man from Queens who was riddled with bullets on his wedding day, was still alive.</p> <p>My wife, who is African American, shared my reservations about Obama, but saw things differently. She remembers the thrill of being a young girl when the black Democrat Harold Washington was elected in her hometown, Chicago. She liked him because her parents liked him. She could see it was important, but she didn't know why.</p> <p>\"My dad grew up being told a black person couldn't be a pilot, and my son is growing up knowing that a black person can be president,\" she said. \"It's not that racism is gone, it's just that it's not about the idea that all black people are excluded on the basis of their race from any part of society or any particular job. That was the racism my parents grew up with and that is now one generation removed from Osceola.\" Her dad became a pilot, as did her brother.</p> <p>Of course, Obama isn't standing for Osceola's benefit - which is just as well, because if Osceola could vote he would most likely support Elmo for mayor of Sesame Street. But in a sense these projections lie at the heart of any thoughtful appraisal of the racial dynamics underpinning Obama's candidacy. The desire to believe we are in a paradigm-shifting moment must be set against the fact that not every historic first changes the course of history. Changing our understanding of what is possible doesn't, in itself, create new possibilities. </p> <p>I watched Obama accept the Democratic nomination with my mother-in-law, Janet, in a cinema on the southside of Chicago. Janet was raised in the South with the laws that put her at the back of the bus. As a teenager she went with her mother to see Martin Luther King speak in Philadelphia, listening in the overflow in the vestry because there were too many people in the church.</p> <p>She was the one who first told me about Obama in 2003. She got involved in his primary campaign for the Senate when he didn't have a prayer, after she'd seen him on the local public channel, when he was a state senator. \"He seemed like a bright guy,\" she says. \"He reasoned his way through things and was always very impressive.\" She particularly liked his stance on the war. When he said he was running for Senate, she signed up as a volunteer. </p> <p>And now, here we were just five years later seeing him clinch the deal in Denver on the big screen. At one point, when he recalled his anti-war speech in 2002, she punched my arm. \"I was there.\" As she drove me to my hotel, she would occasionally say to no one in particular: \"I just don't believe it.\"</p> <p>Whether Osceola would ever be able to relate to what a momentous time this is for Janet remains to be seen. But her response made me think that the late comedian George Carlin was wrong. Symbols are too important to be left to the symbol-minded. By that time, my thinking on Obama had evolved. Not so much because of the man, but the moment. The atmosphere during this campaign has been unlike anything I've ever seen in a western country. To see so many people - particularly young people - engaged and hopeful about their political future after eight depressing years is inspiring. The last time I saw it was in South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994.</p> <p>Walking down Sumter Street during Charleston's Martin Luther King day parade, watching white volunteers chant: \"Obama '08! We're ready. Why wait?\" gave political voice to an America I never doubted existed, but had yet to see. Among them was a young man who was \"so depressed\" after Obama's New Hampshire defeat that he had dropped everything he had been doing in Guatemala and flown back to help out. Local African Americans lined the sidewalks, cheering encouragement. Obama's victory in Iowa had proved that a black candidacy was not a pipe dream. </p> <p>It was a moment. Fleeting and maybe even fatuous. But nonetheless a political moment that produced hopeful human engagement. Within half an hour it had evaporated. The white volunteers went back to the office and black people went back to their homes in the poorest parts of town and waited for change. But that didn't mean it didn't happen or that it couldn't happen again. Nor was there anyone else who could make it happen.</p> <p>A couple months later came Obama's race speech in Philadelphia in response to the attacks on his pastor, Jeremiah Wright, in which he addressed black alienation and white disadvantage, set them both in a historical context, and then called on people to rise above it. It was a tall order. He pulled it off.</p> <p>That weekend, a friend invited us to brunch with a group of other black people to discuss the fallout. There were nine of us (10 if you include Osceola, who yanked a blind from the window). It was a typical boho (black bohemian) Brooklyn crowd of voluntary sector workers, teachers and the like. Most, like me, had been ambivalent about Obama at the outset. But his candidacy was becoming a vehicle for something bigger: a teachable moment about the potential of anti-racist discourse.</p> <p>A year before, Hillary Clinton's chief strategist, Mark Penn, laid out a plan of attack against Obama. \"All of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse, multicultural and putting that in a new light. Save it for 2050. It also exposes a strong weakness for him - his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values ... Let's explicitly own 'American' in our programmes, the speeches and the values. He doesn't ... Let's use our logo to make some flags we can give out. Let's add flag symbols to the backgrounds.\"</p> <p>Clinton rejected Penn's advice, but McCain pretty much adopted it. And at this point it appears to have failed. This time Republicans have misread white America's appetite for divisive racial rhetoric and overestimated its fear of the other. The fears and division are still there. But whatever the result on Tuesday, they are clearly no longer the decisive mobilising force they once were. </p> <p>If there is promise in here for my son, it is not so much that he is capable of doing anything he wants - I am his father and it's my responsibility to teach him that - but that white people won't necessarily stop him. What that does for his odds of finishing high school or going to jail remains to be seen. In the meantime, I'm off to the bookshop.</p>",
  "<h2>Girl held captive by her mother for eight years</h2> <p>A girl was held captive at home for eight years by her mother, officials revealed, acknowledging that authorities missed several warning signs of the abuse. The girl was kept in confinement from 1998, when she was 11, until 2006, when she was rescued after a neighbour reported it to police in Sapporo city. An official, Hisashi Okada, said the victim, now 21, was found sitting against the wall in a room, unable to talk or stand, despite having no obvious injuries. Authorities have not charged her mother, who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and hospitalised. Her father separated from his wife in 2004. <br><strong>Associated Press in Tokyo</strong></p> <h2>Doctor refused visa due to son's Down's syndrome</h2> <p>A German doctor in Australia said he would fight a decision by the immigration department to deny his application because his son has Down's syndrome. Bernhard Moeller has been working as a doctor for two years in a rural area of Victoria state to fill a medical shortage. His temporary visa is valid until 2010. The immigration department said Moeller's 13-year-old son, Lukas, did not meet the health requirement for a permanent visa. A spokesman said: \"This is not discrimination ... it is a question of the cost implications to the community.\" Moeller is appealing against the ruling. <br><strong>Associated Press in Sydney</strong></p> <h2>Pair abducted in Tunisia released by al-Qaida</h2> <p>Two Austrians kidnapped in Tunisia by an al-Qaida affiliate have been released, ending an eight-month ordeal and anguished diplomatic attempts to win their freedom. Wolfgang Ebner, 51, and Andrea Kloiber, 43, were freed after 252 days in captivity and were under the protection of Mali's military, Austria's foreign minister, Ursula Plassnik, said yesterday. Al-Qaida in Islamic North Africa claimed responsibility for abducting the pair in February while they were on holiday in Tunisia. The precise circumstances leading to their release remained unclear but Plassnik said the kidnappers let them go. <br><strong>Associated Press in Vienna</strong></p> <h2>Dog gone 1,000 miles: missing Max heads home</h2> <p>A dog called Max is heading home to Florida after he was spotted in Chicago, 1,000 miles from where he vanished. Richard Gonzalez reported the Maltese breed as stolen after it disappeared several months ago from his daughter's garden in Brandon, Florida. Gonzalez said he thought that Max would never get far. But the dog was identified in Chicago by its implanted microchip. Gonzalez contacted the Northcentral Maltese Rescue to retrieve the dog. The director of the rescue group, Mary Palmer, said she had Max taken to Racine, Wisconsin. The dog will be flown to Florida tomorrow. <br><strong>Associated Press in Racine</strong></p> <h2>Rare three-cent stamp sold for $1m at auction</h2> <p>A rare US postage stamp from 1868 has sold for more than $1m at an auction in New York city. The three-cent, rose-coloured \"B Grill\" stamp was sold in a three-day Siegel auction galleries sale that ended on Thursday. The auction house said that only three other known examples of the stamp remain. \"B Grill\" refers to the embossed pattern in the stamp paper. An anonymous buyer put in the winning bid of $1,035,000 (\u00a3620,000). The auction also included one of the most famous stamps, the so-called \"Inverted Jenny\" from 1918, which features a biplane accidentally printed upside-down. <br><strong>Associated Press in New York</strong></p> <h2>Catholic priests face screening to end scandals</h2> <p>The Vatican has issued new psychological screening guidelines for seminarians... the latest effort by the Roman Catholic church to be more selective about its priesthood candidates following a series of sex abuse scandals. The church said it issued the guidelines to help church leaders weed out candidates with \"psychopathic disturbances\". The scandals have rocked the church, triggering lawsuits costing hundreds of millions of pounds in settlements. The guidelines \"became ever more urgent because of the sexual scandals\", said Monsignor Jean-Louis Brugu\u00e8s, who oversees seminaries. <br><strong>Associated Press in Vatican City</strong></p>",
  "<p>Missiles exploded in two villages in north-west Pakistan yesterday, killing 27 people including foreign fighters, in the latest in a surge of alleged American strikes, intelligence officials said.</p> <p>One raid was said to aim at an Arab militant identified as Abu Kasha Iraqi, but if was unclear if he was killed, officials said on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak to the media.</p> <p>Suspected US drone planes have fired at alleged militant targets in Pakistan at least 17 times since mid-August. The increased frequency of the strikes has badly strained America's alliance with Pakistan, where rising violence is exacerbating economic problems and threatening stability.</p> <p>Scores of foreign al-Qaida members are believed to be hiding out in Pakistan's lawless border area with Afghanistan. The area is also considered the likely hiding place of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>The US rarely confirms or denies firing the missiles and the identities of those killed are rarely made public. Locals frequently say civilians, sometimes women and children, are among the dead.</p> <p>The first of yesterday's attacks took place in Mir Ali village in North Waziristan after drones had been flying overhead for several hours, the intelligence officials said, citing reports from agents and informers in the area. The drones fired twice, hitting the house frequented by Kasha Iraqi and a nearby car, killing 20 people.</p> <p>Two hours later, a second set of missiles hit a village in South Waziristan, killing seven people, including an unspecified number of foreign fighters, the officials added.</p> <p>US drones have made around 15 such missile attacks on militant targets in lawless tribal areas on the Pakistani side of the border since the start of September. American forces also launched a cross-border raid in the same month.</p> <p>Scores of people have been killed but no senior al-Qaida or Taliban leaders have been reported to have died.</p> <p>The latest attacks came two days after Pakistan summoned the US ambassador to protest against missile strikes and demand that they be stopped immediately.</p> <p>Pakistan is battling militants on its side of the border but says the US strikes undermine efforts to isolate the militants and rally Pakistani public opinion behind the unpopular campaign against militancy.</p> <p>A senior security official said Abu Akash's real name was believed to be Abdur Rehman, although he was known to have used many aliases. He was known as Akash Khan in Mir Ali.</p> <p>\"He is an al-Qaida man but was not among the top hierarchy,\" said the security official.</p>",
  "<p>The best way to experience an Obama rally is to listen to him while watching the audience. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> is, of course, impressive. His speeches, like his suits, are meticulously measured. In this final week they are tailored to consolidate rather than convince. Though he is reed-thin, he can fill an auditorium, stadium or park with his presence as well as with people. With a big smile full of white teeth, he looks like the most all-American candidate the Republican party has had the misfortune to attempt to dismiss as non-American and demonise as anti-American.</p> <p>But the audience is something else. There are old black ladies dressed for church, whose hands palm up as if to pat the sky while their heads bow down, resonating points Obama makes, with hats perched on buns of salt-and-pepper hair. When he makes points that resonates their heads go down like as their hands go up, palms open, as though they are trying to pat the sky. </p> <p>There are young white kids, their universities emblazoned on their hoodies, who roll their lower arms in big circles from the elbow as though showing appreciation at a football game. There are old white veterans who occasionally nod but otherwise stay seated while others rise. And there are black children held high on parents' shoulders so they can capture a moment they do not yet fully understand.</p> <p><strong>Contagious energy</strong></p> <p>The energy is contagious. Bettie Bell, 87, was swaying to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, And Delivered\" as she tells me she \"never thought I'd see this day\" when a black man might be president. Bell grew up in Mississippi and moved to Ohio when she was 20. \"We couldn't vote back then. But this time I voted already ... The Bible says, 'One day a small nation will rise up.' Well it's our time and it feels wonderful.\" </p> <p>The numbers are staggering. A capacity crowd of 4,900 in the civic centre in Canton, Ohio; 9,000 outside in the teaming rain in Chester, Pennsylvania; 35,000 at 11pm in Kissimmee, Florida. </p> <p>To hear supporters talk, you would think they have come not out of volition, but compulsion. \"I just had to be here,\" says Jeannie, who drove from West Palm Beach to Kissimmee to see Obama. \"I can hardly believe I've come this far to go to a rally in the middle of the night. But it's history. I had to see it for myself at least once.\"</p> <p>As the week drew to a close, the mood was torn between anticipation and anxiety. On the one hand, supporters feel as though they are on the verge of a great historical moment. On the other, they resist the complacency that could deny it to them. For the last 20 months they have been told to believe. With 72 hours to go, they dare not believe too much.</p> <p>\"After the last two times I just don't want to jinx it,\" says Susan Aylward, from Akron, Ohio. \"Everything looks good. But I won't believe it until it actually happens.\"</p> <p>In the parts of the country where the election will be decided, they've counted chickens before, and have no intention of doing it again. Chris Magoon, a field organiser in Canton, told people to \"put the polls away\" and reminded them that Ohio was lost in 2004 by just nine votes per precinct. When the pastor who delivered the convocation in Chester, Pennsylvania, the same morning said: \"Lead us not into temptation,\" the sin he was referring to was hubris.</p> <p>There is also the pervasive fear that Obama might be assassinated. Nobody says it out loud, but nobody needs to. The pastor who blessed the Chester rally called for God to \"deliver us from evil that will harm any candidate\". In Canton the clergyman looked for God to \"Love him, carry him and keep him\".</p> <p>Then there are worries that the election will be stolen. The pastor in Canton prayed that \"every voting machine will work correctly\". Jeannie in Kissimmee shrugged at what surprises election day might bring. \"It's Florida,\" she says. \"You just never know.\"</p> <p>And finally there is mistrust of polls that may mask racial prejudice. Rosa Scott of Canton, who is in her 70s, grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and remembers the bus boycott lead by Martin Luther King. \"Down there they let you know if they didn't like you. But here they're more sneaky with it.\"</p> <p>Obama opened the last full week of campaigning in Ohio with his closing argument. It is a hybrid of the unifying themes that first gained him national attention - reassurance that his taxation policy will only affect the very wealthy, and his trademark call for change. He rose to prominence in 2004 because of his opposition to the war. But as he heads to the finish line four years later Iraq barely gets a mention.</p> <p>The question in this election, he says, is not: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" - referring to Ronald Reagan's now famous jibe at the Carter years. \"We already know the answer to that. Will this country be better off four years from now?\" </p> <p>In a populist turn, he asks the audience: \"How many of you earn less than $250,000 a year?\" When they all put up their hands he continues, \"Well, my tax policy won't cost you a dime.\"</p> <p>Ridiculing McCain's claim that his \"desire to spread the wealth\" makes him a socialist, he said: \"Lately, they've been calling me a socialist and they found evidence that when I was in kindergarten I used to share my toys, and in the fourth grade I split my peanut butter sandwich and they said look, he's a redistributionist ... There's nothing wrong with looking out for other people.\" The Florida crowd starts a chant of \"O-bama\". </p> <p>As he flies around the country, local and national events provide him with a strong tailwind. On the day he came to Ohio, the Cleveland Plain Dealer's front page was about Friday's collapse of Ohio's largest bank, National City. The next day the Philadelphia Inquirer showcased the conviction of Alaska's Republican senator, Ted Stevens, on six counts of ethics violations, bringing the possibility of a filibuster-proof Senate one vote closer. </p> <p>As he took to the stage in Kissimmee, the Orlando Sentinel reported that polling hours had been extended to cater for the unprecedented surge in early voting, with registered Democrats overrepresented and African Americans punching almost twice their demographic weight at the booths.</p> <p>For all the caveats, caution, denial and downplay, Obama's itinerary explains why he has every reason to be confident. With the exception of Pennsylvania, Obama has spent the last week travelling in states George Bush won in 2004. He needs 18 more electoral college votes than Kerry to win. </p> <p>He hasn't been behind in a poll in Iowa (seven votes) since he accepted the nomination, nor in New Mexico (five) in seven weeks. He has led in Virginia (13) and Colorado (nine) for the past month, and Florida (27), Ohio (20) and Nevada (five) for at least the last week. He is mounting challenges in North Carolina and Missouri. </p> <p><strong>Tightening race</strong></p> <p>He only needs one or two of these polls to be right to win. His team expect the race to tighten in these final days. But for him to lose, there would have to be a full-scale, last-minute reversal.</p> <p>With Bill Clinton by his side in Florida for the first time, the Democratic party's generational baton-change is almost complete. Leaving the stadium in the dead of night, the weight of expectation is evident in the T-shirts on sale. Some bear a socialist-realist print of Obama's face with a single word like Hope, Progress, Believe or Change. One shows Obama and Martin Luther King with the message: \"Dreams we can believe in\". Another has him dressed like a secret service agent and \"Mission Possible\".Yet another in Spanish says: \"Nosotros creemos en el cambio\" (We believe in change). </p> <p>With only three days left to sell, hawkers scour the crowd for people who might yet buy. They've bought his message. But will they wear it? It's five to midnight. He's closed his arguments. Now he has to close the deal.</p> <h2>Key moments of the campaign</h2> <p><strong>January 3: Iowa Democrat caucuses</strong></p> <p>Barack Obama wins Iowa caucuses after deploying large group of paid field staff who organise supporters, ensuring a big turnout. His victory proves his viability, especially among wary African-American voters, and anoints him the early front-runner.</p> <p><strong>January 7: Clinton cries in New Hampshire</strong></p> <p>The former first lady is fighting for survival when one voter's innocuous question about her appearance \u2014 how do you manage? \u2014 leads to tears<br>before the TV cameras. What initially looked like a gaffe became the humanising moment she needed, and led to a win in New Hampshire. </p> <p><strong>March 4: McCain wins Republican nomination</strong></p> <p>Given up for dead in 2007, McCain surges to victory in four states and secures the Republican nomination He promises to give voters \"a contest of ideas\" rather than \"an uncivil brawl\" but he accepts George Bush's endorsement.</p> <p><strong>January 28: Kennedy backs Obama</strong></p> <p>Obama is often compared to John F Kennedy\u2014 both men sought the presidency as young, untested senators with a gift for oratory. He wins the powerful family's support when the late president's brother, Senator Ted Kennedy, and daughter, Caroline, declared him the heir to JFK's legacy.</p> <p><strong>February 29: The 3am phone call advert</strong></p> <p>The Clinton team, realising Obama is in for the long haul, tries to make voters fear his inexperience. Clinton's now-classic advert tried to make voters fear his inexperience, featuring the White House phone ringing in the dead of night, inspires numerous parodies \u2014 and more than a few stump speeches from John McCain.</p> <p><strong>April 28: The Rev Wright speaks</strong></p> <p>Obama faces tricky questions about his outspoken former pastor, whose sermons railing against US policies hurt his campaign with white voters. The Rev Wright responds with a combative speech accusing Obama of disowning him \"because he's a politician\".</p> <p><strong>May 6: Clinton's last stand</strong></p> <p>With her early advantage gone and her money running out, Clinton gambles all on winning Indiana and North Carolina. A narrow victory in the first and a loss in the second means the primary contest is all but over \u2014 but Hillary will not concede.</p> <p><strong>June 3: Obama clinches the nomination</strong></p> <p>It comes down to the very last states and the endorsements of super-delegates, put Obama over the victory line \u2014 and gives his wife their famous celebratory fist bump. Clinton does not admit defeat until days later,<br>leaving open wounds in the Democratic party.</p> <p><strong>August 28: Obama's acceptance speech</strong></p> <p>Republicans mock the Greek columns, the A-list celebrities, and the adoring throngs at Denver's Invesco Field. But when Obama emerges to give the first open-air nomination speech since Kennedy, even his critics agree it is a<br>political masterstroke, and Obama has all the momentum until ...</p> <p><strong>September 3: Meet Sarah Palin</strong></p> <p>The young governor of Alaska is the surprise choice for McCain's running mate. The choice dominates the news cycle and the Republicans find their new heroine after a convention speech combining spirited attacks with folksy appeals to God and country.</p> <p><strong>September 14: It's the economy, stupid</strong></p> <p>Wall Street investment banks Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers crumble under the weight of bad mortgage-related securities, the latest and biggest highprofile failures of the financial services industry. Obama takes advantage of American uneasiness, linking McCain to Bush and thus the crisis on Wall Street.</p> <p><strong>September 17: Palin falters</strong></p> <p>CBS news anchor Katie Couric's interviews with Palin on the law, economy and foreign affairs mark a turning point. Her cringe-inducing performance \u2014 she can only name one Supreme Court decision she disagrees with, the landmark abortion case, Roe v Wade \u2014 ignites a backlash among conservatives that persists throughout the election.</p> <p><strong>September 24: Hold the campaign</strong></p> <p>As Congress and the White House discuss the bail-out of the financial system, McCain says he will \"suspend\" his campaign and returns to Washington to help. He calls for a delay in the presidential debate. Obama calls his bluff, saying a president should be able to deal with two tough tasks at once. McCain's surrogates continue to attack Obama and campaign ads still run. The debate goes ahead as planned.</p> <p><strong>September 26: Face to Face I</strong></p> <p>The first of the three debates gives voters a side-by-side comparison of the 47-year-old gym buff and the 72-year-old former prisoner of war. In a sometimes caustic forum, Obama tries to tie McCain to Bush and McCain tries to paint Obama as dangerously inexperienced. Polls show a win for Obama.</p> <p><strong>October 2: Face to Face II</strong></p> <p>Vice-presidential debate. Sarah Palin holds her nerve against Joe Biden, delivering mostly coherent answers, surpassing expectations after the Couric interview and reviving Republican enthusiasm for her candidacy.</p> <p><strong>October 12: Enter Joe the plumber</strong></p> <p>Ohio labourer emerges as mascot for McCain's effort to tar Obama as a tax-and-spend socialist after he quizzes the Democratic candidate on the campaign trail. McCain claims that the case of Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher proves Obama's policies will hurt the little guy. It turns out that he would actually be better off under Obama's tax proposals, but that does not stop Republicans from trotting him out at rallies.</p> <p><strong>October 19: Powell's sucker punch</strong></p> <p>Colin Powell, George Bush's former secretary of state and one of the most powerful African Americans in US history, broke with the Republican party, saying Obama \"demonstrated the kind of calm, patient, intellectual, steady approach to problem solving that I think we need in this country\". Some McCain supporters, notably radio host Rush Limbaugh, contend Powell made the pick because Obama is black.</p> <p><strong>October 29: Obama \u2014 The Movie</strong></p> <p>Obama runs a 30-minute TV ad on most major US television networks, at a cost of $1m per channel. The spot features the candidate describing his policies, and several down-and-out swing-state Americans explaining how hard they have it. The implication: If you are down on your luck, an Obama victory will improve your lot \u2014 especially if you live in Missouri, New Mexico<br>or Ohio.</p> <p><strong>Big Dog weighs in</strong> </p> <p>Days before the election, Bill Clinton holds a joint rally in Florida with Obama. Relations between the two had reportedly been testy after the bitter primaries battle, but they were all smiles and effusive praise on the night.</p>",
  "<p>The picture-postcard town of Lewes in East Sussex is best-known for its annual bonfire celebrations. But in early September it shot to national attention for another reason - launching its own currency in the hope of boosting local businesses and beating the credit crunch.</p> <p>As the town prepares for its feisty November 5 commemoration of the Guy Fawkes gunpowder plot and of 17 Protestant martyrs burned there by Mary Tudor in the 16th century, this year sparks have also been flying ... about the Lewes Pounds. </p> <p>Eager children were buying their post-school snacks with the smart green note, decorated with 18th-century radical thinker and resident Thomas Paine on one side and Lewes castle on the other; townsfolk were walking to the shops to buy with it and the community in general enjoyed a powerful boost to its civic pride.</p> <p>Then they ran out. Just three days in, the initial 10,000 pounds had been bought with only a portion making their way into the economy. Many residents bought them as souvenirs, while some fell into the hands of collectors or were sold on eBay for \u00a335 a piece. </p> <p>Undaunted, the Lewes Pound Group issued further currency on October 4. Group member Oliver Dudock van Heel, is coy about how much. \"If you put a figure on it, people assume scarcity,\" he says. \"There are now 25,000 in circulation and more in stock.\"</p> <p>Although cutting CO2 emissions and depriving the chain stores of some of the town's cash are all on the pound's manifesto, Van Heel stresses that its initial aim was simply to encourage people to spend locally and to increase a sense of pride in the community. \"All we wanted in the first year was to raise awareness of local shopping and we have already done that in the first two months. People really get the idea.\" </p> <p>But is it only Lewes's middle-class, left-leaning, eco-aware residents who have embraced the concept? \"No,\" he says. \"There has been a lot of interest across the town, a complete spectrum of individuals.\"</p> <p>Seventy traders were signed up to the scheme at launch, but this has mushroomed to 125. Amongst them are Lewes big guns, Bill's Produce Store (recently bought out by Richard Caring, owner of London's celebrity haunts The Ivy and Le Caprice) and the Harveys brewery, which now also gives 10% of all its charitable donations in the pound, and has launched a beer, the Quidsin, in honour of the scheme.</p> <p>The pound is scheduled to circulate until August 30, 2009, but the Lewes Pound Group - working with the New Economics Foundation - is already considering how to take it forward beyond that date. \"All we need is enthusiasm from traders and the people of the town,\" says van Heel. \"If, in six months, it is being traded and people want to keep it, then it will continue.\" </p> <p>Introducing higher denominations is a priority for a second phase, as many of the more exclusive shops and boutiques at the top of the High Street report scant, or no, sales in Lewes Pounds. \"I am absolutely in favour of it, but I have never been offered it,\" says Daphne Culligan, of boutique Renwick Clarke. \"Apart from \u00a310 T-shirts, the clothes here are too expensive to pay for in single pounds.\" </p> <p>Higher denominations demand a substantial increase in security, and consequently cost more to produce, while the modest \u00a31 note has proved super secure. A cheaper option is a card-based system, like the WIR used by 16% of Swiss businesses. </p> <p>While higher-end shops may have to wait until phase two, traders like Sue May, of May's General Store, are already feeling the benefit. \"People use it without commenting - it's become normal,\" she says. Between 15% and 30% of her sales are in the Lewes Pound and her shop is busier than ever. \"There's real interest and also a loyalty factor - people try to shop locally.\" </p> <p>Sue is also one of three issuing points for the currency and finds people typically exchange \u00a340 or \u00a350 at a time. Last week she issued around 900, \"and to a real mix of people\". Andi Mindel is one. A single mother, who volunteers at Friends of the Earth in London, she changes around \u00a3120 into Lewes Pounds each fortnight. </p> <p>\"It makes me feel deeply rooted here,\" she says. It has largely replaced sterling for her and her eight-year-old son, Daniel, who gets five as pocket money every fortnight. \"I go to Waitrose for the things I can't buy locally, otherwise I buy everything with it.

There isn't a Lindt chocolate maker in the town, or a cigar manufacturer.

What this town needs is work. The Lewes Pound, while it provided real local interest, is not the long-term answer. It's simply a novelty.\"</p>",

Little has changed in 600 years: flagged floors, stone walls and heavy beams.

Bedrooms are tremendous value for money and full of uncluttered country-inn elegance with free-standing Victorian baths, huge shower heads, crisp linen - all of which will be most appreciated on New Year's Day after a night living it up at their Prohibition Party.

  "<p>You thought it was all waltzes and wiener schnitzels? But Vienna is also about wine. More than that, Vienna is the only world capital with a serious wine industry. Within the city limits, Vienna boasts 700 beautiful, visitable hectares of vineyard and 320 wineries. Put these together with a new breed of forward-looking vintners, add in Austria's commitment to organic farming and the city's surprisingly affordable wine taverns, and you have my hot tip for Europe's coolest wine destination - and the perfect place for a festive tipple.</p> <p>As a city of classical culture, Vienna has it all, of course - symphony halls, opera houses and art galleries all dressed up in mighty architecture. Frau Koch, my informative (if arch) guide, walks me briskly through the Museum Quarter, talking of crown prince this and empress that. The sense of God-given power emanating from all these imperial statues and wedding cake edifices carries with it the stale whiff of pomp, designed to keep plebs like me in our place. </p> <p>At Schwarzenbergplatz, outside the Wiener von Welten Palace, there is a tiny vineyard. Here, Frau Koch informs me that a) the lord mayor is a socialist, and b) the socialist is also a winemaker: he ceremonially picks the grapes from this vineyard with his own egalitarian hands. The city also owns 35 hectares of prime vineyard in the bucolic 19th district, our next stop. </p> <p>After a 15-minute ride on the Green Line tram, and a short bus ride uphill, we are ready to start the 10km walk to Neustift am Walde. Along the way we will pass through the villages of Nussdorf, Sievering, Cobenzl and Grinzing. The Viennese wine region straddles both banks of the Danube. From up here in the hills, the forest and vines are clothed in autumn gold, and Vienna's vaulted sky is lapis lazuli blue. </p> <p>This afternoon, the Vienna hills are alive with the sound of Gore-Tex clad peripatetic wine drinkers. The city's spires, houses and towers are spread far below us like so much Enlightenment Lego. With its grassy inclines and wooded dips, the Wine Trail offers the opportunity for serious exercise, and also for serious drinking. What the bierhalle is to er, beer, the heurige (plural, heurigen) is to wine. Heurigen punctuate the Wine Trail every few hundred metres: there are hundreds of them all over the city as well. </p> <p>A heurige is always family-run, and exists to sell the wine produced by that family. You know when one is open by the bunch of pine branches displayed over its front door. In 1784, emperor Franz Josef decreed that winemakers be allowed to sell their own wine from home, and with food, too. You sit at a suitably rustic pine table, surrounded by, say, pairs of ice skates; old photos of whiskery men; whiskery old men with noses like pomegranates; antlers; amusing slogans describing how yesterday's inebriation does not remember today's thirst; or happy smiling people, sometimes with their dogs. Having bridled a bit at her pursed, prim city centre, I feel that in the heurigen I've found Vienna's blithe heart. </p> <p>Heurigen can hold anything from eight to 800 people. In the larger establishments, your waitress will be wearing a traditional dirndl-type arrangement and, invariably, a welcoming smile. You order heuriger (young white wine), alt from last year's harvest (if they have any), or the red, if you like thin, tart, acid wine. Many people around you will be drinking a spritzer, which is half heuriger, half soda water. A quarter litre of any of these is no more than \u20ac2.50, and usually a bit less. Quality ranges from very good to truly excellent. For a euro or two more, you choose from a huge array of real cheeses, meats and delicious fresh breads: many places also offer hot food like wiener schnitzel and, in November, roast goose and potatoes. </p> <p>The grape's harvest and pressing is celebrated around these parts in November, and from then until Christmas Day, heurigen are in full swing, as Vienna celebrates the season with dozens of Christmas markets. The most famous of these, outside the town hall, has been running since 1296 and is open daily until 9.30pm. Better, though, is to explore further afield: markets and Christmas \"villages\" spring up around the city in small squares, cul-de-sacs and alleys, where wooden huts dispense chilled white wine, hot punch and gl\u00fchwein, grilled sausages and sugared almonds. </p> <p>The village of Grinzing is famous for its heurigen, though some can be a bit coach-party. For an authentic large, multi-roomed heurige, head away from the main drag to Hengl-Haselbrunner (Iglaseegasse 10, 0043 1 320 3330, <a href=\"http://www.hengl-haselbrunner.at\">hengl-haselbrunner.at</a>). People have drunk wine here since 1683, and the church next door is where Beethoven realised he was going deaf. I get blind drunk.</p> <p>I also loved the cosy front-room homeliness of Gabriella and Friedl Schoell's place (Coblenzgasse 108, eccentric opening times - check first on +1 664 490 6391 and at <a href=\"http://www.buschenschankschoell.at\">buschenschankschoell.at</a>). Up an unassuming flight of steps, the Schoell's alcove seat also doubles as the wine press. Conversation flows readily between tables. This is lubricated by my hostess, Gabriella, and also in October and November by sturm, a semi-fermented new wine that tastes deliciously of sharp fruit juice, but has a kick like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Frau Koch and I spend happy hours drinking biodynamic sturm. Austria's dominant wine grape is gruner veltliner, known locally as gru-vee. More archduke than Rio, Vienna isn't groovy, but her wines are truly cool.</p> <p>\u2022 Rooms at Hotel Altstadt Vienna (+1 522 66 66, <a href=\"http://www.altstadt.at\">altstadt.at</a>) from \u20ac119 per night B&amp;B.

November 11 is St Martin's day, when the new harvest is officially declared, and celebrated city-wide in large quantities of white wine and roast goose.</p>",
  "<p>Toni Morrison breaks off from explaining a crucial passage in her new novel - Florens, the main character, has just been searched by a posse of witch-hunters - to check her mobile. \"It's my son,\" she apologises, \"is he kidding me?\" She calls him back for a quick discussion about the latest presidential election headlines. </p> <p>\"We're gonna have such fun!\" she exclaims afterwards. She will watch Tuesday night's TV coverage with friends, she says excitedly, but her assessment of what an Obama presidency might mean is measured: \"It would be good, it would be interesting, it would have an impact, I think.\" Morrison famously described Bill Clinton as \"the first black president\" (\"I said he was treated like a black man, and he was, but anyway they ... what can I say? Nuance is not a strong point\"), and took her time in coming round to Obama. \"I didn't know him,\" she says. \"I knew Hillary. I really, really liked her and for years admired her.\" The first time Obama called and asked for her support she said no, but \"we chatted for quite a while\". In January she changed her mind and wrote a letter of endorsement that glowed with praise for his \"wisdom\". </p> <p>A Mercy, Morrison's first book in five years, is published in the UK on Thursday, and is released in the US a few days later. Though publishing schedules are fixed months in advance and production of the book must have been well under way by the time Barack Obama was finally selected as the Democratic candidate, the timing is surely no accident. </p> <p>In A Mercy, the 77-year-old Nobel laureate writes directly about American slavery for the first time since her celebrated 1987 novel Beloved. Though A Mercy is a very different book - around half the length, more episodic than epic, set in the 17th century rather than the 19th - it is billed by her publisher as a companion piece, or \"prelude\". Morrison says the new work is an attempt to separate racism from slavery, \"to see how it was constructed, planted deliberately in order to protect the ruling class\" from the \"unpaid labour\" on which their new civilisation and wealth depended. So as the US looks set to elect an African-American president, its pre-eminent African-American writer delivers her own vision of America uncorrupted - or only beginning to be corrupted - by racial thinking. </p> <p>Morrison's great achievement, in a career spanning four decades and nine novels, has been to combine deep psychological insight with a vigorous and original critique of American history. \"My books are always questions for me. What if? How does it feel to ...? Or what would it look like if you took racism out? Or what does it look like if you have the perfect town, everything you ever wanted? And so you ask a question, put it in a time when it would be theatrical to ask, and find the people who can articulate it for you and try to make them interesting. The rest of it is all structure, how to put it together.\" </p> <p>In her debut, The Bluest Eye (1970), written in the early mornings while she was working full-time and raising two sons in New York, Morrison crafted a highly literary fiction out of the interior lives of poor black girls growing up in her hometown of Lorain, Ohio. Sula (1973) told a story of female friendship, partly inspired by her own life as a single mother and a more complex, ambivalent view of \"sisterhood\" than many in the feminist movement would then allow, while Song of Solomon (1977) took its alienated protagonist, \"Milkman\", on a voyage of discovery to the deep south.</p> <p>But with Beloved, her prizewinning novel set in the aftermath of abolition, Morrison hurled herself at the legacy of slavery and the 20th-century American literary canon head-on. Inspired by a newspaper cutting she found while editing an African-American history anthology, The Black Book, and audaciously weaving together realist, modernist and supernatural elements, it tells the story of a runaway slave who, rather than give up her children when her former owners come looking for her, cuts her daughter's throat.</p> <p>It is a novel of unspeakable horrors. But even more than the physical brutality, Morrison confronts us with the irreparable harm done by what Margaret Atwood described in a review as \"one of the most viciously antifamily institutions human beings have ever devised\", a system that sought to deprive human beings of what it is that makes them human.</p> <p>\"We were very keenly involved in the culture of African America, so of course slavery was back there,\" Morrison says of her upbringing in the midwest, \"yet the pressure was not to remember it, but to get over it. So when I was writing Beloved, part of the architecture was the act of forgetting.\" When Beloved failed to win the National Book Award, a group of 48 African-American critics and writers including Maya Angelou and Alice Walker wrote to the New York Times praising Morrison, and the novel won the Pulitzer soon afterwards. Morrison herself is alert to the ways in which black and women's writing have been patronised and excluded from the mainstream, and after winning the Nobel in 1993 she wrote that she felt she had earned a \"licence to strut\". </p> <p>Her novels found an influential champion in Oprah Winfrey, who chose four of them for her book club, ensuring huge sales. Winfrey also produced and starred in the 1998 film of Beloved, directed by Jonathan Demme. Morrison's response to critics who suggest her canvas is too narrow is to cite Joyce and Dostoevsky: no one complains that Joyce always writes about the Irish, or Dostoevsky about Russia. She projects a formidable self-belief, but the impression of imperiousness is offset by her soft voice and almost girlish manner.</p> <p>A few years ago she bought a house on Princeton's main street, a long straight avenue with the university campus on one side and a parade of colonial-style architecture, bookshops and ice-cream parlours on the other. She has done the top floor up for her two grand-daughters, as \"classical little girls' rooms with all the pillows ... I know it's just a luxury but I had such fun.\" The contrast to her own childhood in Ohio could hardly be greater. \"There were factories there, shipyards, steel mills, and people came from all over to work,\" she says. The town was not segregated along racial lines - \"Mrs Gallini lived next door and the Terschaks on the other side, that's the way it was and I thought the whole world was like that.\" Both her parents' families migrated north to escape poverty. </p> <p>Morrison, who was born Chloe Anthony Wofford in 1931 - Toni was the nickname she took as a student, Morrison is her ex-husband - had two younger brothers and an older sister. Her father worked as a welder, but \"after the war began, my parents had less and less, and their conflicts were the conflicts poor people have.\" </p> <p>In The Bluest Eye, Morrison depicts Lorain as a town cruelly stratified along class and caste lines. Homelessness, or \"being outdoors\", is \"the real terror of life\", and while Pecola Breedlove is doomed by her perception of her own ugliness, the more spirited Claudia is frightened by urges to harm the \"little white girls\" whom even black women seem to prefer to their own daughters. Morrison has said she would have brought up her sons differently had she anticipated the poisonous race relations of the 1980s, but of her own youth she says she \"felt like an aristocrat\", and when I ask if she remembers when recognition of her own blackness dawned, wondering whether she too suffered from feelings of rage or insecurity, she fires back: \"That's not the question, the question is when you first understand you're white.\" </p> <p>But on the lessons of the past her parents were deeply divided: \"My father never trusted any white person at all, would not let them in his house, insurance people and so on. Luckily my mother was entirely different, she was always judging people one at a time. My mother talked about her childhood in the south - she left when she was about six - as if it was the most wonderful, romantic, nostalgic, lovely [memory]. And my father talked about it in diametrically opposed ways. But he went back every year to this place he hated [Georgia], while my mother never went back to Alabama, the place she loved.\"</p> <p>Such conflicts recur in her novels, which dig away at rather than paper over the cracks in the African-American story, exposing divisions of religion, politics, class and gender. She chose to go to the traditionally black Howard College in Washington DC because she \"wanted to be around black intellectuals\", and has sought to explore the compromises and sacrifices as well as the triumphs of integration. Her novel Paradise (1998) is a brutal fable of what happens when the dream of an all-black community turns sour, while Love (2003) mourns the ruin of an African-American entrepreneur's dream: an upmarket black holiday resort crumbling into the sea. </p> <p>She edited books about the controversies surrounding OJ Simpson's trial for murder and the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the supreme court, while her criticism has drawn attention to the racial themes of such classics as Moby-Dick and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. African religion, medicine and stories are shown to have vivid meaning for Morrison's characters, but she has never been to Africa: \"something always happened or I couldn't get there\". In Beloved, Stamp Paid reflects that \"Whitepeople believed that whatever the manners, under every dark skin was a jungle. Swift unnavigable waters, swinging screaming baboons, sleeping snakes, red gums ready for their sweet white blood.\" But there are black racists in her books too, who believe whites are subhuman, devils.</p> <p>With its focus on a time before the slave system, A Mercy confirms Morrison's determination to think beyond racial categories. The novel sets out to blur the lines and its characters include indentured servants, slaves, a Dutchwoman sold into marriage (whose filthy voyage is the closest Morrison has come to writing about the slave ships) and a free black man. She also writes from the point of view of a white slave owner for the first time, and when I ask whether she and others are now moving towards a \"post-racial\" literary discourse - in a parallel development to what commentators have described as Obama's \"post-racial\" politics - she concurs, before offering the qualifier that \"you have to walk that line, you don't want the culture de-raced\". </p> <p>But she agrees that the emphasis placed on race by critics has meant that other aspects of her writing have received less attention. The questions she asks in her books have deep ethical and philosophical dimensions. What is love? Can a woman recover from having killed her baby? What does it mean to be forgiven? Like Beloved, the new novel springs from the action of a mother, a slave who gives her daughter away to a different master in the belief that he will be kinder, but when I say what a terribly sad story it seemed to me - Florens is desperately hurt, and then rejected again by her first lover - I am briskly corrected: \"No, no no! Think about her, she was completely needy, yearning, selfless, 'my life is in you, I can't live without you'.\" The heartbreak of the novel, in its author's view, teaches its protagonist a lesson: \"do not give yourself over completely to anybody. At least you know she'll never do that again.\"</p> <p>Morrison calls Jazz (1992), a love story set in 1920s Harlem and narrated in such a way that the book itself speaks in the first person, her \"best book\" in terms of the technical obstacles she set herself. She relished the challenge of 17th-century dialogue posed by A Mercy, and describes her experiments with vocabulary and tenses. She has been reunited with her original editor, Robert Gottlieb, a former New Yorker editor and her exact contemporary. </p> <p>She has never got over her house in Rockland County, New York, burning down in 1993: \"My books and manuscripts I couldn't care less about, but my children's report cards ... There's a picture of my son shooting a basketball into the sky and it's gone.\" But she jokes that at least she won the Nobel prize that year as well, and has made an anecdote out of the fact that, for a long time, she could talk only to other people who had suffered house fires. (\"Maxine Hong Kingston - she and I were on the phone every day!\") </p> <p>The prospect of a book tour is more daunting than it once was, and she hopes her son Ford will join her on this one. But she has two more book projects already in mind, one of which promises a departure. Only once before, with Tar Baby (1981), has she set a story in the present, and that was in the Caribbean, but she says \"I've got sketches which are very much now\". </p> <p>For 40 years she has written of passionately experienced sexuality, and every possible permutation of family. Her early marriage to Harold Morrison, an architect from Jamaica with whom she had her two sons, lasted only six years, and she has rarely discussed it. When I ask whether she would have liked to remarry, she bats away the question with a \"no, no, no\", and she dismisses the idea that she might ever write her memoirs: \"It's just not interesting, my life is not adventurous ... The life of the mind is interesting, but all these other little foibles? Please.\"</p> <p>Morrison's family still call her Chloe, and she has often said that her pen name of Toni Morrison was a kind of accident. She says that when her father died, she was upset that she hadn't kept the name Wofford, and tells a story about a talk she gave in England where a young black woman in the audience asked her how she wanted to be remembered. \"I said as an honest, trustworthy person - I think I even put humour in there. And the girl said 'What do you mean? You just won the Nobel prize and you want to be remembered as a trustworthy person?' And I didn't know what to say. I was talking about how I want to be remembered by my family. Do I want to be remembered by my sons as a writer who won the Nobel prize? There's a persona, Toni Morrison, and there's me, Chloe. They were asking Toni Morrison and I answered as Chloe.\" </p> <p>But she is in no doubt as to what enabled her transformation from one into the other. \"My sons needed me to be real, to know what I was doing, you know? When people say they don't have time to write with small children, well, for me it was the opposite. I didn't write anything before I had them. They gave me that.\"</p> <h2>Morrison on Morrison</h2> <p>\"I walk alone except for the eyes that join me on my journey. Eyes that do not recognise me, eyes that examine me for a tail, an extra teat, a man's whip between my legs. Wondering eyes that stare and decide if my navel is in the right place if my knees bend backward like the forelegs of a dog. They want to see if my tongue is split like a snake's or if my teeth are filing to points to chew them up. To know if I can spring out of the darkness and bite. Inside I am shrinking. I climb the streambed under watching eyes and know I am not the same. I am losing something with every step I take. I can feel the drain. Something precious is leaving me. I am a thing apart. With the letter I belong and am lawful. Without it I am a weak calf abandon by the herd, a turtle without shell, a minion with no telltale signs but a darkness I am born with, outside, yes, but inside as well and the inside dark is small, feathered and toothy. Is that what my mother knows? Why she chooses me to live without?\"</p> <p>At this point Florens has already had the first sense of self-loathing, where the people say they associate blackness with Satan, and after they've examined her body she feels like a different species under their gaze. Something has died in her, and everything looks like it's looking at her in that hostile way. The trees are looking at her, everything. And she's thinking if they are looking at her because she's black, and finding that a problem and possibly evil and satanic, then it's something she has to think about. Now that she's by herself, she thinks maybe they mean there's something inside of me that really is bad and maybe they're right? It's the crumbling of the psyche.</p>",
  "<h2>Tony Christie, Born To Cry (Autonomy) </h2> <p>\"The king of retro-cool\" according to pop-cult authority <a href=\"http://www.ageconcern.co.uk\">ageconcern.co.uk</a>, Tony Christie's 48-year singing career has encompassed success, obscurity, greater success and a fraught 37-year search for a small cattle town in rural Texas. Now, though, the 65-year-old enters his imperial phase with the Made In Sheffield album, on which he tackles songs by his Steel City descendants (produced by Richard Hawley; covers of the Arctic Monkeys and Human League). Originally a Pulp track included on the soundtrack CD to Notting Hill, Born To Cry is an unrestrained grandstanding/world weariness combo that allows Christie's sonorous voice free reign. Glorious. </p> <h2>Scooter vs Status Quo, Jump That Rock (Whatever You Want) (Sheffield Tunes) </h2> <p>Scooter are the Hamburg trio whose martial brand of techno-pop has, revealingly, made them the most successful German band ever. Status Quo are Status Quo. Here the former are mysteriously pitched against the latter on a cover of the Quo's 1979 hit Whatever You Want. Watch the video and sob at how the distressed-looking rockers appear genuinely confused at being surrounded by dry ice and sledgehammer beats, looking for all the world like lost Victorian time travellers transported unexpectedly into the middle of the Tet Offensive. </p> <h2>Kanye West, Love Lockdown (Mercury) </h2> <p>The flyer single from Kanye's forthcoming fourth album now inhabits a brawnier mix than the demo leaked on to the net in September but, on first listen, it's still a disconcertingly lo-fi stew of autotuned vocals, tribal drums and piano licks. For the world's most famous rapper to totally abandon rapping on his comeback is a bold move; that Kanye should house such a personal song in such defiantly odd packaging verges on genius. </p> <h2>The Charlatans, Oh! Vanity (Cooking Vinyl) </h2> <p>Of all the bands formed in the saucer-eyed pell-mell of the late-80s baggy scene, only a pathological optimist would've suggested that the Charlatans would still be making records two decades later. Yet here they are with their 31st single - besting death, bankruptcy, name changes and Tim Burgess's current predilection for modelling his hair on a nine-year-old Korean girl. There's more to them than tenacity, though, as Oh! Vanity's insidious groove proves. Long may the Charlatans make music that sounds like New Order transported to a 1960s roller rink.</p> <h2>Christina Aguilera, Keeps Gettin' Better (RC) </h2> <p>Christina Aguilera claims to currently draw great inspiration from Andy Warhol's Factory studio circa 1968. Remarkable, not least because the musicians who normally claim to be inspired by the Factory do so because they enjoy the idea of recreational intravenous amphetamine abuse as a prelude to pan-sexual three-day orgies. Still, repeated listens to Keeps Gettin' Better fail to illuminate what it is about Warhol that's inspired Aguilera; unless he went through a phase making oppressive glam-pop before he discovered Campbell's soup cans.</p>"
