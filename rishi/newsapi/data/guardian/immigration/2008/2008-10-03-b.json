  "<p>Benny Sithole can be forgiven for thinking himself unlucky. Four years ago, he left his home in southern Mozambique with the clothes on his back and the cellphone number of a childhood friend in his pocket. He was heading for Johannesburg, South Africa, to find work and money. Within two years, he had created a stable business - a fruit and vegetable stall just a few hundred yards from the shack he had made his home. It was a modest enterprise, but he was earning enough to support a mother and two sisters back home. He had also married a South African woman, a Xhosa-speaker named Kate Ntsaluba, and had a wide circle of South African friends.</p> <p>On the afternoon of May 18 2008, some of Sithole's neighbours, among them young men he'd known quite well, drove from their homes him and his wife and every other foreign national in the settlement. After the couple had gone, the invaders looted their shack, distributing its furniture among themselves. Next, they tore down Sithole's fruit and vegetable stall to use for firewood.</p> <p>\"I received no warning,\" Sithole said. \"On the Saturday night, they were the same people they had been since the day I met them. By the time the sun set on Sunday, they had told me I must either leave or die.\" Neither Sithole nor his wife has returned, he for fear of being killed because he is foreign, she because she suspects she will be raped for sharing her bed with a Mozambican.</p> <p>Benny and Kate Sithole are among the tens of thousands of victims of a pogrom, the first to take place in Nelson Mandela's rainbow nation. Several million foreign nationals have poured across South Africa's borders since the end of apartheid, most of them illegally. They have received a mixed welcome from ordinary South Africans and state officials alike. This May, South Africans in shantytowns across the country decided to throw them out.</p> <p>Exactly a week before the Sitholes fled their home, trouble had begun 30 or so miles away in Alexandra, a densely populated township in northern Johannesburg. At the time, it seemed to have come from nowhere. On the afternoon of May 11, a crowd of South Africans gathered on the outskirts of the township and attacked the occupants of an abandoned factory said to be inhabited primarily by Zimbabweans. By the following morning, the crowd had grown and was moving through Alexandra's shack settlements, driving foreigners from their homes, looting some and burning others.</p> <p>During the next few days, the violence spread from Alexandra as if by contagion. The following week there was looting and killing in shantytowns as far away as Durban and Cape Town. Three weeks after it began, it was all but over, having been doused by the army and police, who made more than 1,000 arrests. More than 60 people were dead, and tens of thousands had had to flee their homes.</p> <p>Few South Africans would deny that what happened is both a catastrophe and turning point in their country's history. Mandela's South Africa was not long ago the world's most celebrated young democracy. Johannesburg's inner-city neighbourhoods were among the most cosmopolitan places on the continent. Many dreamed that it was on these streets that a new African identity might emerge. At the very least, the May riots herald the end of a young nation's innocence.</p> <p>For the violence takes its place in a long sequence of bad news. The ruling ANC, long considered the most sober and unflappable of Africa's liberation movements, seems in recent times to have drifted from its moorings. Over the past two years, it has been roiled by the bitterest and most unseemly of conflicts between rival factions. Now, little more than four months after the riots, the battle for power has reached a dramatic climax; South African President Thabo Mbeki has resigned after a palace coup in his own party. His probable successor, Jacob Zuma, is a wild card, a populist figure whose supporters have launched ominous and cynical attacks on the judiciary in an attempt to scupper an impending corruption trial against him. The party is turning into a new creature, one that is as yet unknowable.</p> <p>And so there is trouble among South Africa's elite and in its shantytowns. It is tempting to draw a comparison between the two. The chilling acquisitiveness with which mobs have looted and burned the homes of foreigners bears comparison with the thuggery and naked hunger for power recently displayed in the ranks of the ruling party. Some of Zuma's supporters have threatened to kill those who would obstruct their man's ascendancy. And the battle within the ANC has had other destructive results. South Africa has faced one crisis after another. Serial electricity blackouts hit much of the country this January. It emerged that poor government planning had left the country short of power for years to come, handicapping future investment in mining and manufacturing, a dire prospect for a country desperate to get the unemployed into work.</p> <p>This was the backdrop to the attacks that began in Alexandra on May 11. There hasn't been a nationwide outbreak of social unrest like it since the dying days of apartheid. South Africa's defeated former president has himself been prone to talk in apocalyptic terms of the cost of failing to deliver on the South African dream. Mbeki is fond of misquoting a poem by Langston Hughes: \"What happens to a dream deferred?\" he has asked. \"It explodes.\"</p> <p>In South Africa it is the season to denounce Mbeki, and many have blamed him for the xenophobic riots. He is gone now, but the makings of a conflict, more far-reaching than the one we saw in May, remain.</p> <p>The decisions Benny Sithole made during the first days of trouble could have cost him his life. He listens avidly to radio news, so he knew by the morning of May 13 that thousands of foreigners were fleeing Alexandra. Yet as the violence spread to within striking distance of his own home, he had no thoughts of moving. \"I just didn't believe it was possible,\" he said. \"Four years is a long time to live in one place. You are settled. You know many people by name. Maybe in other places, I thought. But not here.\"</p> <p>The Sitholes lived in Ramaphosa, a shantytown of some 30,000 people about 20 miles from Johannesburg - in an area called Dark City, the last part of the settlement to remain unelectrified. Like dozens of other settlements around Johannesburg, it emerged overnight, when recent immigrants erected shacks on municipal land. Over the years, the government has steadily provided it with one service after another, first water, then electricity, then several hundred brick-and-mortar houses. A cross-section of southern Africa lived there: South Africans from all over the country with their many languages, Zimbabweans, Mozambicans, Malawians, small minorities of Angolans and Congolese. All are first-generation Johannesburgers, and almost none regards the city as home.</p> <p>\"The trouble started far from Dark City,\" Sithole said, \"in the centre of Ramaphosa, where the non-South Africans have set up rows and rows of stalls. They sell everything from vegetables to live chickens. A group of young men came to steal the chickens, knock over the vegetables and kick the stalls down.\" The next day, the crowd worked its way through Ramaphosa, gathering numbers as it moved. By the Sunday morning, the crowd was close enough for Sithole to hear them. Those who had gathered to loot and kill were singing freedom songs composed during the struggle against apartheid. Only now, they no longer sang of white minority rule, but of foreigners, and of the jobs, houses and women the foreigners had stolen.</p> <p>\"With the singing in our ears,\" Sithole said, \"something happened. The young unemployed South African men of Dark City - people I know very well, people who sit and play dice all day long - started to take things from our stalls. They took handfuls of tomatoes and cabbages. Some of the older people came and called the younger ones to task, then went back to playing dice.</p> <p>\"There is this committee in Dark City. It is composed of the South Africans who live among us. It called an emergency meeting; the idea was to form a defence unit to keep the crowd away from our homes. But halfway through the meeting, the committee changed its mind. It decided, no, we are not going to stop them. Some South African neighbours came to me and said, 'You must go. If you stay, you will die.'</p> <p>\"I ran to the shack of a South African friend at the other side of Dark City,\" Sithole continued. \"He has been a customer of mine every day for four years. He let me in. I phoned my wife. She was out working. I told her not to come home. My friend sheltered me for four days and nights. I did not dare to come out in case I was recognised. I must have been the last Mozambican left in the whole of Ramaphosa.</p> <p>\"On the fifth night, my host came to me looking upset. He said, 'Listen, this place is not the same, it is run by thugs now, and there is talk that I am hiding foreigners. You must go.' \"</p> <p>Sithole stole out of Ramaphosa at 2am the following morning the same way he had arrived - with the clothes on his back. When we met, he was living in the back of a truck with several other refugees outside Reiger Park police station, less than a mile from Dark City. \"My South African customers have come out of Ramaphosa one by one to pay their respects to me,\" he said. \"They tell me they are so embarrassed by what has happened.\"</p> <p>Sithole is adamant he will stay in South Africa. \"My wife is here. I will not find work in Mozambique. There are plenty of places here in Johannesburg where the foreigners are still accepted. I have friends from home in Soweto. Things are peaceful there. It is not yet time for us to run.\"</p> <p>Sithole is right. South Africa's several million foreign nationals have not been expelled, and most of urban South Africa remained quiet during the two weeks of trouble. There were rumblings for a night or two in parts of Soweto, but the violence did not explode there. In the massive shack settlement of Diepsloot, west of Johannesburg, the trouble lasted one night. The next day, the local branch of the ANC began a campaign charmingly dubbed Shit On The Criminals. Looted property was confiscated and several dozen young men arrested. Ramaphosa is among the few places to which foreign nationals have been unable return to rebuild their lives.</p> <p>And yet, looking at the origins of the violence and how it spread, the question remains - when and in what form will it come back, and who will be the target next time?</p> <p>Alexandra township, where the violence began, occupies little more than a square mile of northern Johannesburg. Built to accommodate 60,000 people, it is now home to about 400,000. Those who flock there have laid claim to every conceivable space. What were once the playing fields of a local high school are now occupied by 1,200 shacks. The backyards of houses in the heart of the original township are lined with tin shacks: some tenants pay rent to the family in the main house; some don't.</p> <p>Were the troubles simply a case of a vastly overpopulated place finally snapping? It is not as simple as that. There was forewarning of the violence. It was advocated in public forums in the days before it began. \"It happened in the middle of our regular weekly forum at the police station on May 6,\" said Thomas Sithole (no relation to Benny), chairman of the Alexandra Community Policing Forum. South Africa's constitution mandates every police station commander to establish such a forum to consult with the civilians in his jurisdiction. \"Out of nowhere, the representative from the Beirut section of the township stood up and said that the people in his area were sick and tired of crime, and that the police were doing nothing about it. He said they were ready to gather arms and retaliate. Then, four days later, on the Saturday, a meeting of the residents' association in that area was held at a church on Third Avenue. It ended with a resolution to chase out the foreigners. The violence began, in that sector, the following day.\"</p> <p>The area has been dubbed \"Beirut\" because it is no stranger to urban warfare. In 1996, conflict in Alexandra erupted between the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the ANC in the run-up to municipal government elections. Zulu-speaking IFP supporters were chased from their homes and resettled in Beirut. Non-Zulu speakers fled Beirut. That the area is Zulu is largely a result of violence.</p> <p>The troubles of this May were concentrated in Beirut. When foreign nationals began returning to Alexandra after the violence subsided, those whose homes were outside Beirut went back to their original shacks. Those from Beirut did not. Non-Zulu-speaking South Africans in Beirut reportedly lost their homes, too. Joe Sikwale, a veteran civic leader in Alexandra, told us, \"The Venda speakers who were chased away were told their homeland is so close to Zimbabwe that they are not South Africans. Shangaans were told that, because they share the same language as Mozambicans, they must run away with their Mozambican brothers.\"</p> <p>Local party politics may be at the root of the violence. The IFP once controlled the municipal ward that incorporates Beirut. It lost it in 2006, when ward boundaries were redrawn to include a large bloc of ANC supporters. It is conceivable that local party activists, stung by the loss of influence that comes with control of a ward, wanted to change the composition of the electorate.</p> <p>Yet if the first days of unrest strongly echoed a fight that took place 12 years earlier, there were marked differences. In 1996, the violence remained party political, and it stayed in Alexandra. This time, the troubles spread quickly, and as they did so they lost much of their ethnic character. In Ramaphosa, where Benny and Kate Sithole fled their home, the IFP has little or no presence. \"The people marching and singing through Ramaphosa were Zulu, Xhosa, Pedi, South Sotho: they were all South Africans mixed,\" Sithole said. Of the scores of refugees we interviewed who had taken refuge at police stations and town halls, most said they had run from \"thugs\", \"young ruffians\" and \"drunks\", all speaking a mixture of languages.</p> <p>Victim after victim told us that the violence took them by surprise. And yet, clearly, the news from Alexandra that mobs had turned upon foreigners stirred a powerful current, inspiring people around the city and the country to do the same. The mobs sang of foreigners stealing houses, women and work. Behind their choice of words lies much of the explanation of the violence.</p> <p>\"People say there is a struggle for resources going on between South Africans and foreigners,\" a senior Johannesburg bureaucrat, who asked not to be named, told us. \"Actually, the struggle is long over. The foreigners have won hands down.\"</p> <p>He is exaggerating, but a study recently conducted by the authoritative Centre for Development and Enterprise found that the unemployment rate among foreign nationals in Johannesburg was 20%. The roughly equivalent figure for South Africans in Johannesburg is 33%. In that large difference lies an important story. Of the 80% of foreign nationals who work, more than half are self-employed. This is all the more remarkable when one considers that most arrived here illegally, without benefit of venture capital or even a bank account. Many are what development economists call survivalists, working long and difficult hours to earn the equivalent of an unskilled labourer's wage.</p> <p>Many, though, are much more than that. The study found that foreign nationals employ 100,000 South Africans across Johannesburg. This entrepreneurship is the face of immigration in the poor neighbourhoods. From sidewalk barbers to fresh produce traders, their work is conducted on the streets and in roadside stalls. As for wage labour, anecdotal evidence suggests that employers are recruiting foreigners over South Africans in construction, security and domestic work, according to Professor Lawrence Schlemmer, who managed the Centre for Development and Enterprise study.</p> <p>In housing, there is a parallel story. Since coming to power, the ANC government has built more than two million homes, known as RDP houses, for the poor. Walk into any shantytown, and people will show you the document proving that they have been on a waiting list for a house for five or 10 years. A common complaint among those waiting is that many RDP homes are occupied by foreigners who have acquired them by corrupting government officials. There are other explanations.</p> <p>\"What an unemployed person needs above all,\" said Julian Baskin, of the Alexandra Renewal Project, \"is income. Give an unemployed person a house and she will be tempted to sell it. The banks won't underwrite the sale. It must be cash. So it's cheap. Foreigners in South Africa working or running a business will have cash. It figures that they'll be well represented among secondary buyers of RDP homes.\"</p> <p>Of the 50 or so refugees we interviewed, almost all worked, either as wage labourers or as entrepreneurs. Most said that a great many of the South Africans they encountered every day were unemployed. When we asked why they appeared to find work more easily than South Africans did, many answered by disparaging their South African neighbours. \"To be selling fresh vegetables by seven in the morning,\" Benny Sithole told us, \"I must start making my way to the fresh produce market at 3am. I can say that there is not a single South African awake at that time. The people on the street preparing for work are foreigners, every last one of them. For the South African, 3am is too cold. He must sleep until eight.\"</p> <p>A Mozambican we met, who identified himself as Alberto, had run a construction business in South Africa for the past five years. He employed eight people, all recruited from his village in Mozambique. \"We arrived in this country without tools,\" he said. \"At first we accepted any job, even if it paid R40 ($5) a day. A South African will not work for that amount, especially not for a white man. As we worked, so we saved. We bought tools. When we started the business, we offered to build for very little money. Business picked up. We charged more. As we gained success, so we bought televisions and stereos and other nice things. The South Africans got angry and wanted to steal our nice things. From their point of view, what they saw was foreigners coming to do work they refused to do and then buying things they could not afford.\"</p> <p>Refugees we spoke to believed that South Africans were workshy because they looked to the state for their salvation. A Malawian named Napier Banda, who, until the troubles, lived in a small shack settlement on the outskirts of Boksburg, said, \"Many of my South African neighbours were unemployed. Most of them were Zulu. They complained that the reason they had no work was that Thabo Mbeki was a Xhosa. They said that when Jacob Zuma [who is Zulu] comes to power, he will deliver for them.\"</p> <p>As we toured one site of violence after another, it became apparent how overwhelmingly local politics are consumed by struggles over state patronage. In Alexandra, a building contractor constructing RDP homes on the eastern rim of the township complained he was forced to source his labour through a local ANC man, who skimmed off the top of everyone's wage. Those squatting in abandoned factories to the north of Alexandra were required to pay rent to an executive member of the South African National Civics Organisation, a body aligned to the ANC.</p> <p>In a shantytown called Jerusalem, a few minutes' drive from Ramaphosa, we met a South African woman named Grace Obose, who ran a police-sanctioned citizen's patrol group. We asked if anyone had ever threatened her. \"The only time they tried to kill me,\" she said, \"was before the 2006 municipal election. There was a fellow in the ANC who very much wanted to stand as a councillor in this ward. But someone else was already standing. So he and his backers joined the Pan African Congress. I have a big following in this community. They told me I must come with them to the PAC so they could win. I kept saying no. One night they threw petrol on my shack and lit a match. Thank God I was awake and escaped.\" In Jerusalem, who had access to the local government budget was clearly a matter of life and death.</p> <p>At a workers' hostel in south Johannesburg, inhabited primarily by networks of Zulu migrants from KwaZulu-Natal, we interviewed the local IFP leader, Boy Simelani. \"The ANC has sewn up the 2009 elections,\" he complained, \"because of the World Cup in 2010. All the construction for the World Cup is controlled by the ANC. They will be handing out the jobs. Our chance to win votes will come only after the World Cup is finished.\"</p> <p>Those who believe that income derives primarily from state patronage essentially view the national economy as one great barrel around which everyone gathers to feed. You jostle with your neighbours for access to it. You fight for your share. And if this is how you see things, the presence of several million foreigners becomes both a special provocation and a source of confusion. For with their stalls and businesses and incessant work, they seem to be taking something that ought to have been given to you, the patrimony owed to you as a person who survived apartheid and voted into power a democratic government.</p> <p>This is how those who admitted to us that they had taken part in the violence justified what they had done. Two weeks after an immigrant was burned to death in Ramaphosa, the ANC Women's League held a prayer meeting on the spot where the mob had set him alight. Outside the meeting a group of sullen young men gathered to express their discontent. One of them, who identified himself as David, told us he had joined the crowd and driven out foreign nationals because they were stealing chunks of South Africa's economy. \"This entire country is leaking into the pockets of Mozambicans,\" he said. One of his companions joined in: \"They have flooded this country like water, but they are leaving our land dry.\"</p> <p>And the hostility is not simply directed at foreigners. Grace Obose told us that while the mob that ran riot in Jerusalem targeted foreigners, \"it also attacked the two biggest shebeens [drinking dens]. Both are owned by South Africans.\" The mob had formed to loot and it no longer cared for the distinction between being foreign and being relatively wealthy. The two had become the same.</p> <p>Why have many South Africans come to see their democracy as a battle for state patronage? Moeletsi Mbeki, an outspoken critic of his brother Thabo's former government, and the only South African commentator whose opinions make headline news, tells a withering tale. When it was clear that apartheid was dying, he says, South Africa's captains of industry asked themselves what to do to prevent the country's liberation movement from nationalising the banks and mines, as promised. Their solution was to offer to buy off the new political elite: to offer it large chunks of equity across South Africa's economy. The new elite said yes, and the pact was sealed.</p> <p>The government has called the programme Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). The rationale of BEE is to \"transform the white-owned economy to be representative of the demographic make-up of the country as a whole\". Yet Mbeki is fond of pointing out that the major beneficiaries of large equity transfers are all individuals connected to the ANC. For that is precisely the point: what is being traded is political influence.</p> <p>The ANC, Mbeki argues, is behaving precisely the way the first generation of post-independent African elites did in the 60s, using the state power it has captured to enrich itself. Perhaps the struggles for state patronage witnessed at the sites of the recent violence were a case of a people doing just as their leaders have done.</p> <p>Worryingly, South Africans appear unable to talk much about any of the major ingredients of May's violence. Ethnic differences, clearly an important subtext during the troubles, are a taboo subject. Nor can South Africans talk with much freedom about the resentment they feel for having to share their country with several million foreign nationals. \"Our country belongs to all Africans,\" is a phrase government officials and ANC functionaries have repeated over and again since the troubles. Nor are political corruption and kickbacks subjects for polite conversation. South Africans find themselves in the midst of a very serious impasse about which they cannot speak.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonny Steinberg's new book, Three-Letter Plague, is published by Vintage in January</p>",
  "<p>Imagine a 66-year-old widower who gets a letter from a bailiff. He's tearful. He's petrified. He thinks he's going to court and he feels guilty already, even though he's done nothing wrong. It's not his fault oil prices have gone up. </p> <p>We're the place people come when they have nowhere else because of homelessness, immigration problems, or if they're one of these older people who are frightened by bailiffs. I make sure our approach is informal. People get their cup of coffee and it's, 'Where are you from? What part of Liverpool? Oh, do you know so-and-so?' You go down to their level - not by patronising but by trying to understand. When billions of pounds go into the Olympics, it's organisations such as ours that suffer. Sure, I'd be unhappy if we lost all funding, but the people we help are the ones who would really be affected. </p> <p>I have my family around me. My mother and father are still alive, and it makes me happy to see them maintain their values and political beliefs. My friends are ex-dock workers who haven't succumbed to the Murdoch society. We're bombarded with this one idea: make money and you'll be happy. I suppose we're a country of individuals now, but we were never like that. Liverpool was famous for believing an injury to one was an injury to all. We still believe, but I'm fearful the era is ending. I hope not. That would make me truly unhappy.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Letter No 799, December 29 1963 </strong></p> <p>The carols, wrote an old New York writer, have not drowned out the requiem. I guess that puts it about as simply and truly as it can be said. But they made a brave try, once the mournful 30 days was over and the flags were hoisted to the top of their masts. </p> <p>On the last day [of official mourning for America's assassinated president], last Saturday, I went across the Potomac river, which separates Washington from the state of Virginia, and went up the hill into Arlington national cemetery. </p> <p>All the leaves had gone from the trees, and it was possible to stand almost anywhere on the sloping ground and look around the crescent from the north and the west to the south and see the rows of simple white slabs running over the little hills as rhythmically as vines: these are the dead, the known and always one unknown, from all the wars since the civil war.</p> <p>It was a brilliant winter day, cloudless and fogless, but as the sun burned out over the snowfields the temperature was down to a piercing 12 degrees: 20 degrees of frost. On a little plateau you could see a white square, and in the middle of it a curious point of orange light. I suppose that from now on, as long as anyone can foresee, all the motorists who cross the bridge, either to go south or to go to work in the Pentagon, or to take an aeroplane at either of the Washington airports, will see this white rectangle and the light inside it. For this is the gravesite of John F Kennedy. That, of course, was where I was bound. </p> <p>I must say I have always approved of the dispatch with which Americans bury their dead, usually within two days of the death. But one of the curious things about this event was its magnetic attraction for the young people. My son, in his early 20s and just graduated from college, is still living in the college town of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and on the Monday of the funeral he came into New York looking like a ghost. He came to tell me about his trip to Washington. He had flown down there from Cambridge the evening before and arrived outside the Capitol at about 7.30 in the evening. He lined up with the longest and quietest queue anyone could remember, about a quarter-million people who waited to go into the Capitol and see their president lying in state under the great Rotunda. He stood, in biting cold, and got in at six in the morning, into the warmth of the Rotunda and the overpowering scent of flowers. He walked around the bier and came out and went to the airport and flew to New York and slept through the afternoon. Like many of his generation, he is not overly sentimental. He said, though, that he felt he just had to do it, and that what he would never forget was the way the crowds stood and talked. \"I'd guess,\" he said, \"that half, maybe three-quarters, of the people in line were students or kids of college age.\" </p> <p>Well, I don't know whether I inferred from this a rebuke that certainly was not intended. But finding myself in Washington last weekend, I thought I had better go and see the place where he was put to rest. A hundred, maybe 200 people were lined up in single file along a narrow path that was covered with matting against the frost and snow. </p> <p>While I was there, and afterwards, and as long as the last of the sun allowed you to look back and see them, there were always the same number, moving and halting in a snake line. They stood there, again very many young people, freezing in blue jeans or shivering in corduroys and burying their heads in short jackets. We stamped and crouched against the knifing wind, and went up the hill and came nearer to the white rectangle and its guard of soldiers. Now you could see on the left a flat standing stone inscribed with the name of the lost baby of the midsummer. On the right was a small cross bearing the inscription, \"Baby Girl Kennedy\", this one never came alive. In the middle was the mound with no stone or slab but at its head only a circle of flowers, with the seal of the United States described in purple flowers, and around the circle the words, \"President of the United States\". </p> <p>Considering that Washington is a monumental city, with avenues as wide as Paris, laid out as it was by a Frenchman at the end of the 18th century, you would naturally expect something austere and very grand. With all respect, indeed with a curious kind of respect you never would have anticipated, this looked like the hasty grave of, say, the town clerk or selectman of a small New England village who had died in the night. So there it was, the earthly remains of the 35th president beneath a tumble of leaves and fronds and pine cones and a few caps thrown on top, and no name. It had a sort of rural pathos about it, as if all our pretensions to riches and a career and power had been swept aside in the impromptu energy of some poor village gardener wanting to do his best, by way of tribute, before the nightfall. The snake line of people paused on the hill side of the rectangle, and some people froze a stance and snapped pictures, and some just sauntered by, and a soldier or a marine would pull himself straight and salute, and people lifted their necks out of their collars and looked awhile, or lifted up their small children and put them down and mooched on ... John Kennedy might just as well have been the promising son of an Irish forebear who, like many another immigrant in Boston, was plucked untimely - by some swift epidemic - and buried in a bit of ground.</p> <p>Then the Sunday came in, and then the Monday morning with a whirling snowstorm, and the flags, which, after all, are as neutral as clocks, flew high and angrily from the top of their staffs. This snowstorm, which blew in from, of all places, the Gulf of Mexico, chilled the usually warm southland and tore across the Ozarks and the plains, and blotted out the eastern seaboard and upstate New York and New England and blew itself out to sea. </p> <p>So I think Tuesday was the dawn that we had been waiting for: a typical shining winter day, and now all the wreaths and photographs had gone from <br>the shop windows, and the newspapers burst out of their sobriety and started to berate the Congress for hedging the foreign-aid bill. Once you emerge from this wholly strange stupor, it is already as plain as can be that all the natural emotions of an energetic people were cowed but have not been tamed. </p> <p>In Grand Central station, a Massachusetts housewife retorts, \"I'm a Republican, but I think President Johnson has been wonderful.\" A negro redcap porter says, \"If he follows Kennedy, he'll be a good man.\" A conductor says, \"Well, it's too early to tell, I'll wait and see.\"' An attendant at the luggage room says, \"I don't know, I still have to work. It doesn't make any difference to me who's president. They all make a lot of promises.\" \"Take it easy, boy,\" says an onlooker. </p> <p>And what does President Johnson say? He says, \"I'm goin' home to Texas, and maybe I'll get in a day's hunting. Maybe I'll just go off into the hills and do a little communing with myself.\" </p> <p>We have come through.</p>",

One of the main reasons for the pressures facing the defence budget is a refusal in the past by military chiefs, officials and ministers to say \"no\" to expensive long-term arms procurement projects. </p> <p><strong>Paul Drayson</strong></p> <p>Unlike most wannabe ministers, Dr Paul Drayson took the call from Gordon Brown yesterday at the Road Atlanta race circuit in the US. </p> <p>The new science minister was preparing to race his Aston Martin in the Petit Le Mans race today. It was his passion for racing that took him out of government in November 2007. Then minister for defence procurement - a post he had held since May 2005 - he wrote to Gordon Brown to resign, citing \"a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take my racing to the next level\". </p> <p>In 1993, Drayson founded PowderJect Pharmaceuticals, a vaccine manufacturer based in Oxford. He has been a big Labour party donor and was made a life peer by Tony Blair in 2004, within weeks of donating \u00a3505,000 to the party. He is reported to have a personal fortune of about \u00a380m.</p> <p><strong>Damian McBride</strong></p> <p>The public part of the career of Gordon Brown's press and political adviser came to an end in the reshuffle yesterday but it was set in motion at 3.15am a week last Wednesday. </p> <p>That was the moment McBride stormed into the foyer of the Labour party conference hotel to confirm the resignation of Ruth Kelly as transport secretary. </p> <p>McBride will continue as a \"long-term adviser\" in the backrooms.</p> <p>His replacement, Justin Forsyth, is the PM's international development special adviser. </p> <p>Forsyth, who has worked with Tony Blair on development in Africa as well as on climate change issues, is a former campaign and policy director at Oxfam.</p> <p>Forsyth's great skill is keeping the huge non-governmental organisation lobby onside to such an extent that after having left Oxfam and working for Blair for a year, the former prime minister is said to have remarked: \"I am still trying to get Justin to come and work for me.\" </p> <p>McBride has long been accused of briefing against dissenting MPs and has been called McPoison.</p> <p>Beginning his career as a civil servant, he rose to head of press in the VAT department before attracting criticism for being too partisan when he released freedom of information papers surrounding details of the 1992 ERM crisis. At this point McBride made the transition over into Labour politics.</p> <p>Accusations of bullying by the ruddy-cheeked Arsenal fan are probably too simple. </p> <p>He may just have become a punchbag for an unpopular government.</p> <p>Further changes to the press team see the former head of Ofcom, Stephen Carter, who had been brought in to spruce up the No 10 press operation, moved. He is now minister for communications, technology and broadcasting, working inside the economic cabinet. </p> <p><strong>Caroline Flint</strong></p> <p>The new minister for Europe, Flint became famous in recent months for being the minister who let the country know how bad the economic situation really was.</p> <p>The then housing minister Flint was photographed going into Downing Street with her pre-cabinet ministerial briefing showing its conclusion: \"We can't know how bad it will get.\"</p> <p>When trying to pilot the reclassification of cannabis through the House of Commons while home office minister, she was the first of that team to admit that she had tried cannabis as a student in the 1980s.</p> <p>But she is a seasoned operator who has been around for a while, first entering parliament in 1997 after being a political officer for the GMB union. </p> <p>Before today's promotion, Flint had held five junior portfolios, including successfully introducing the smoking ban when she was health minister.</p> <p><strong>Jan Royall</strong></p> <p>Jan Royall, new leader of the House of Lords, is a veteran of the Neil Kinnock' era. Royall, 53, was the then-Labour leader's loyal aide for most of his nine-year leadership and followed him to the Brussels commission. </p> <p>A fellow redhead, she retained good friends in London, among them Sue Nye, Brown's gatekeeper at No 10 and 11. She has a tough agenda to tackle - a clutch of bills and a house where the opposition parties have a majority and growing confidence to take on the ailing Labour government.</p> <h2>Who's in and who's out</h2> <p><strong>In</strong></p> <p>Peter Mandelson (business secretary)</p> <p>Lady Royall (leader of the Lords)</p> <p>Lord Drayson (science minister)</p> <p><strong>Out</strong></p> <p>Ruth Kelly (transport secretary) </p> <p>Des Browne (defence seceretary)</p> <p>Lady Ashton, as leader of the Lords but government recommendation for EU trade commissioner</p> <p><strong>Moved (cabinet ministers)</strong></p> <p>Ed Miliband, from Cabinet Office to climate change and energy department</p> <p>John Hutton, from business to defence</p> <p>Geoff Hoon, chief whip to transport</p> <p>Jim Murphy, from minister for Europe to Scotland secretary</p> <p>Hilary Benn, loses climate change but stays with new food department</p> <p><strong>Other moves</strong></p> <p>Tony McNulty, from policing to employment </p> <p>Liam Byrne, immigration to Cabinet Office minister</p> <p>Caroline Flint, housing to minister for Europe</p> <p>Nick Brown, from deputy chief whip to chief whip</p> <p>Stephen Carter, from No 10 unit to Lords as technology minister </p> <p><strong>Staying</strong></p> <p>Alistair Darling (chancellor)</p> <p>David Miliband (foreign secretary)</p> <p>Jacqui Smith (home secretary)</p> <p>Ed Balls (children's secretary)</p> <p>James Purnell (work and pensions secretary)</p> <p>John Denham (universities)</p>",

  "<p>I started reading the Guardian in 1956, on the recommendation of my headmaster. I still recall how six boys huddled together and wept as we read the list of Manchester United players who had died in the Munich air crash.</p> <p>My readership of the Guardian has gone through a hundred phases. In my boarding school sixth form it was a mark of rebellion. University was a dramatic reversal: on the ultra-radical Sussex University campus in 1968 you couldn't be seen dead with any \"quality\" newspaper other than the Guardian. In the 1970s I had an obsession with Watergate and the Guardian seemed to have a better hotline to the Washington Post than others. The 1980s began with a radical critique of the Falklands war, and so it went on. </p> <p>From working with asylum seekers in Harlesden in 1969 to German executives in this decade, I have relied on the Guardian to keep me informed. For some reason the Guardian connected with my deeper sense of identity in a way that no other British newspaper has ever done.</p> <p>Today I am chairman of my family business and I am still reading the Guardian. I could hang that on a variety of hooks: my liking for its political coverage, or its arts coverage, or the fact that it has so many wonderful writers. In the end, though, my attachment to it is something more fundamental - what the Guardian has to say not only informs my own views, it also serves as a benchmark against which I feel a need to justify my own position. </p> <p>When I find myself disagreeing with Guardian writers it upsets me because they, at some level, are my intellectual kith and kin. So whenever there is a major political storm I am drawn, almost subconsciously, back to the newsagent, to find the answer to the question: what does the Guardian have to say?</p>",
  "<p><strong>8.5/10 </strong><br><strong>Telephone</strong> 020-7592 1222 <br><strong>Address</strong> 20-22 Queen Street, London W1 <br><strong>Open</strong> Mon-Sat, lunch noon-2.45pm, dinner 6-10.45pm </p> <p>In an overdue bid to plug the gap in national life that has been left unfilled since the death of Marjorie Proops, I begin today with an answer to a reader's letter I've taken the liberty of making up:</p> <p>Leave him, love. You say that you have been together ages, and that you'd be nothing without him. All right, you're terrified of going it alone - who wouldn't be? But you also mention in your nonexistent letter that you turned 40 a couple of weeks ago, and even if life doesn't begin then, independence should. Girlfriend, he's stifling you. It's time to make the break.</p> <p>The recipient of this unwanted advice is Angela Hartnett, whose new restaurant, Murano, leaves an aftertaste I can't recall before. It's the poignant sense of a genuinely immense talent shackled by bonds of loyalty, in this case to the potty-mouthed svengali Gordon Ramsay.</p> <p>Murano is, according to two central criteria, a first-class restaurant. The service from attentive, smartly attired French staff is superb, most notably from a dashing young sommelier of unusual charm and expertise. And the food is majestic. You'd expect excellence from someone who won a Michelin star while at the Connaught around the corner, before Gordon fell out with the management. But her cooking here strikes me as belonging to a different league entirely. </p> <p>The one problem is that Murano just isn't her. This is the very paradigm of the Mayfair arms dealer's paradise, with a familiar decor - discretion-guaranteeing curtains, thick carpet, colour scheme of beiges, greys and off-whites, fancy Murano glassware and facetious chandeliers - that is far better suited to the selling of fighter jets than to the having of fun. \"Hardly romantic, is it?\" said my friend, who was admitted despite flouting the dress code - a dress code, indeed; very Angela H, that - which outlaws trainers. \"You wouldn't bring a lover here, would you?\" Well, no, not unless your lover was on the hunt for a batch of short-range tactical missiles to flog on to the Saudis.</p> <p>\"Not flash, just Gordon\" is the theme, to borrow a sadly defunct political slogan. More to the point, this sterile paean to over-designed corporate joylessness is not Angela, either, given her earthily bashful nature and Italian genetic and culinary roots. That influence is evident at once in the glorious cured ham served with focaccia and carta di musica (a paper-thin Sardinian crisp bread), and plays such a major supporting role in everything else that you suspect she'd be happier jettisoning all the other stuff that makes the cuisine a kind of Franco-Anglo-Italian hybrid.</p> <p>My starter - from the cheapo set lunch at \u00a325 for three courses - was a gorgeously autumnal, saffron-hued pumpkin and saut\u00e9ed wild mushroom soup that had a potent Parmesan kick, was alluringly velvety in texture and pulled off the rare win double of real delicacy and huge depth of flavour. If ever I am asked on to Desert Island Soups, this will be one of the eight.</p> <p>My friend was almost as keen on pressed rabbit mosaic, from the \u00a330 dearer \u00e0 la carte menu. \"All right, it's piquant,\" he said, after the initial \"very nice\" had been rejected. \"Fine, strong taste, good rustic aesthetic... a posh peasant classic, in fact. And I like the way the rosemary toast comes in a silver rack like you'd expect at the breakfast table if you stayed at Blandings Castle.\" </p> <p>After that reference to the home of the pig-besotted Earl of Emsworth, I felt a bit squeamish about my main course. But the loin of pork had been braised in milk to give it the look and seductive tenderness of veal, and the sweetness of the meat worked so well with salty crushed potatoes and properly opinionated black pudding that I bravely got over it. My friend's roasted Anjou pigeon looked exquisite, being almost as deeply red as venison, and went brilliantly with pickled beetroot and Lyonnaise onions. His side order of potato cakes, in place of semolina gnocchi, came in strips with opulent shreddings of duck.</p> <p>After some tiny and delectable freebie sorbets, the puds were predictably divine. Apricot souffl\u00e9 had the edge over my pear tart with tonka bean custard (the bean, a research mission to the kitchen discovered, is used only to infuse), thanks to the alarmingly sensuous way in which a waitress plunged a spoon into the souffl\u00e9 before inserting a small scoop of amaretto ice cream. Coffee came with the cutest petits fours, but then, so it should do at that price.</p> <p>This was a sparkling meal by any standards, and you may never find a better set lunch for a pony than the one I ate. And yet that little voice nags away that this is a labour not of love, but of fealty. I would love it, really love it, if Angela Hartnett followed Marcus Wareing's lead, or even left Gordon on friendly terms, and opened her own place, because cooking of this quality deserves a setting that reflects the personality of the cook, rather than the fiscal requirements of a public company and its front man. </p> <p>Angela, love, it's time to move on. He's holding you back and you're much too good for him.</p> <h2>The bill</h2> <p>1 three-course set lunch \u00a325</p> <p>Pumpkin and wild mushroom soup Pork loin braised in milk </p> <p>Pear tart </p> <p>1 three-course \u00e0 la carte lunch \u00a355</p> <p>Pressed rabbit mosaic </p> <p>Roasted Anjou pigeon </p> <p>Apricot souffl\u00e9 </p> <p>2 bottles still water \u00a38</p> <p>2 glasses Petite Arvine \u00a317</p> <p>1 glass C\u00f4te du Rh\u00f4ne \u00a36</p> <p>1 glass Gevrey-Chambertin \u00a312</p> <p>1 glass Terrano sherry \u00a310</p> <p>1 glass Gaillac \u00a38.50</p> <p>2 filter coffees and petits fours \u00a310</p> <p>Subtotal \u00a3151.50</p> <p>Service @ 12.5% \u00a318.94</p> <p><strong>Total \u00a3170.44</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Letter from America No 2585, August 28 1998 </strong></p> <p>Last Wednesday evening, just when those of us whose job is to keep one eye peeled for the news feel free to close it and listen in relief to what EB White called \"the most beautiful sound in America: the tinkle of ice at twilight,\" a bulletin came in. President Clinton would make a public speech on Thursday August 27, in Worcester, Massachusetts. Let me put you in the mood - the very wary, watchful, the almost morbidly suspenseful mood in which we heard about that coming speech. </p> <p>Only eight days before, a very chastened president had made what everybody hoped would be a full, liberating confession about the squalid Lewinsky affair [concerning his liaison with a young White House intern]. Yet, it was, to all but a handful of politicians and the media and other public figures, deeply disappointing - tricky, legalistic, evasive.</p> <p>So - came Thursday noon - and heaven alone knows how many people skipped the lunch hour, how many oldsters delayed the golf game, how many journalists in how many states sat with pen and paper or tape recorder to hear a confession. </p> <p>The speech, the occasion - a Massachusetts town, the joyous, stunning reception by a small audience of parents - was the shock. Mr Clinton did not deign to mention Whitewater, the FBI, Ms Monica Lewinsky, or any other inappropriate houri. A young news editor, coming on the tape of this speech 20 years from now, could have dated it 1993; or, since it gave a breath-takingly impressive recital of all the splendid things the Clinton administration had done, maybe it was a triumphant speech at the end of his first term. And that same editor, would have said, \"No wonder they re-elected him. What bounce, what confidence, what intelligence, what a range of knowledge.\" </p> <p>Then he'd see the date: Thursday August 27 1998. Impossible. This a marooned, a besieged president. Where? How? </p> <p>In a totally non-clinical way, Mr Clinton gives the impression of having two characters, the tricky, sly, deceptive, engaging con man, and the public, conscientious, truly concerned, engaging, eloquent, sympathetic statesman. </p> <p>So, the unreal spectacle on Thursday, which for an hour or more made me think we were living on two planets at once: there was this ruddy-faced, engaging, cheerful, funny, eloquent president - reeling off impressive stuff about a balanced budget, lowest unemployment ever, more home ownership, smaller government bureaucracy, determination to make every school in the country safe for children, to free every parent from the haunting menace of guns, robbers, drugs. The small audience gave the cue to all of us and rose with a collective shout of praise and wonder. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Russia was stumbling into bankruptcy, Islam was starting protest marches against the outrage of American [cruise missile] attacks on their soil [in the Sudan and Afghanistan], Saddam Hussein was chucklingly telling the United Nations inspectors to get lost - and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was almost saying, \"Yes, sir.\" The stock market, as Mr Clinton spoke so rapturously, so cheerfully, was plunging down 300 points, as deep a drop as any since the Black Monday of 1987. Surely, in the hour we need him, he <br>will survive.</p>",
  "<p>Where are the Masters of the Universe now? As the financial tsunami rolls out across the world, crushing seemingly invincible institutions in its path and threatening the livelihoods of millions, the blame game has begun.</p> <p>But there's a problem. The most obvious candidates for pillorying have disappeared. Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns have gone up in smoke. Merrill Lynch has been consumed. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have been turned into high street banks, the kind with plastic pot plants in the corner and bowls of sweets to entice the kids. In short: how can you vent your spleen at a ghost? As Bill Clinton, out on the campaign trail for Barack Obama this week, summed up the conundrum: \"The Wall Street you are mad at doesn't exist anymore. It vanished.\"</p> <p>But there is one man who may have the answer to the riddle. Tom Wolfe is one of the shrewdest observers of the world of money. His novel, The Bonfire of the Vanities, first published in 1987, is a magnificent evocation of its era. Central character, Wall Street bond trader Sherman McCoy, personified the avariciousness and self-aggrandisement of the Reagan years. He dubbed himself a Master of the Universe, borrowing the branding from a toy he saw a child playing with. The name fitted: after all, McCoy had the power to make $50,000 in a single phone call, just like that. McCoy's self-description - alongside \"greed is good\", the motto of the fictitious trader Gordon Gekko from Oliver Stone's film of the same year, Wall Street - became the catchphrase of the decade.</p> <p>Over the past two weeks Wolfe has been bombarded with questions: Where are the Masters of the Universe now? Who is left to take the blame? \"The mood of the country is resentment,\" he says. \"People want to gloat over the fate of the erstwhile Masters of the Universe. 'Those rascals! They did this to us! We must get them for this!'\"</p> <p>But Wolfe believes the revenge-seekers are looking in the wrong place. They are no longer to be found in the towering skyscrapers of Wall Street. They haven't worked for the moribund investment banks for years. If you want to find the modern Masters of the Universe you need to jump in a car, drive out of New York city, and head for the leafy suburbs of Greenwich, Connecticut.</p> <p>Round Hill Road begins its snaking path into what they call the backcountry of Greenwich quite modestly, without a hint of the extravagance that lies ahead. The road passes quaint wooden cottages tucked into ancient oak woods, but as it rises so does the scale of the real estate. Lawns start to appear, perfectly groomed, behind ever taller granite walls. Wrought iron gates pop up, some bearing coats of arms and aspirational titles such as Dunnellen Hall. Farther along the road, gravel driveways make their entry, policed by security cameras and warnings to trespassers. By now the abodes have grown to the size of English manor houses. Gables, Doric columns, turrets and elaborate topiary abound. It is as if all the stately homes of Northumberland had been relocated, brick by brick, along this one road.</p> <p>Round Hill Road is one of three billionaire's rows that Wolfe has identified as being the new Centre of the Universe, with more Masters in each of its square miles than anywhere else in the world. </p> <p>They are the hedge fund managers, or \"hedgies\", as they are colloquially known, who run enormously lucrative private investment firms collectively handling $1.9tn (\u00a31.1tn) of business. They are largely free of any regulation and deploy a range of financial wizardry to make their institutional and super-rich clients big returns on their money. Many used to work for the investment banks but were smart enough to get out five or six years ago and set up on their own.</p> <p>And Greenwich, Connecticut, a small town on Long Island Sound about 50 miles from Wall Street, is their capital. To quote a recent New Yorker description: \"If New York city is the heart of the marketplace, Greenwich is the liver, where toxins are processed and rich bits collect.\" There are thought to be about 200 major hedge funds in the area, though that's a guestimate, as the first rule of these operators is deepest secrecy.</p> <p>They share some of McCoy's attributes. They take huge risks with other people's money, though often hedge their bets - hence the name, partly to cover themselves but more often than not to double their profits. They are hugely wealthy, with annual incomes of $500m not unusual. Nor are they averse to enjoying the fruits of such spoils.</p> <p>Take the home of Paul Tudor Jones, one of the first hedge fund managers to move his residence and his business, Tudor Investment, to Greenwich in the early 1990s. He built himself a vast pile on the waterfront. It sits on top of a mound and towers over the old yacht club next door, much to its members' discomfort. When we drive by the property a security van is parked menacingly at the entrance.</p> <p>Then we take a spin past Steve Cohen's house. The son of a dress manufacturer, he used to pore over baseball scores in the New York Post as a child, and used his lifelong love of figures to build a $16bn hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors. In 1998 his family moved into a $15m, 30-room Greenwich mansion, then spent many more millions on renovations. Its grounds include an ice rink, a basketball court and the ubiquitous swimming pool, enclosed in a bubble. </p> <p>Then there's the home of Julius Gaudio, located at the end of a cul-de-sac. It seems to stretch on for ever, its layer upon layer of masonry giving it the look of a wedding cake. A suitable home, perhaps, for the man who once spent $780,000 on two items in a charity auction - a round of golf with Clinton and a pair of Manolo Blahniks for his wife.</p> <p>More recently, a second intake of hedgies has rolled over Greenwich, causing a spate of house-building on such a gargantuan scale that it has left veteran Greenwich residents dumbfounded. They call them McMansions, or, as Bernie Yudain, former editor of the local paper Greenwich Time prefers to call them, \"bad manors\".</p> <p>Being a dab hand at short selling does not necessarily mean you have good taste. Several of the properties we drove past can only be described as monstrosities; they had all the subtlety and lightness of touch of Gormenghast. Many owners appear to think that size is all. In recent months the town authorities have turned down permission for two new homes, one that was to be 35,000 sq ft, the other 50,000 sq ft.</p> <p>\"With each new wave of Wall Street types they demand bigger and bigger houses,\" says my guide to the neighbourhood, Chris Fountain, a real estate agent who writes a wry blog deriding the excesses of the local housing market called For What It's Worth. \"It makes you wonder how many of the properties are going to turn into white elephants.\"</p> <p>It would be wrong to blame all of this on the hedgies. Some of the worst crimes against aesthetics have been committed by new Russian or media money. One extraordinary edifice, a pastiche of a French chateau with conical slate roofs spouting all over it like bristle, was designed for Judge Judy.</p> <p>Wolfe sees an important difference between the modern Master of the Universes and the crude exhibitionism of Sherman McCoy. For a start, they are the smartest of the smart and he thinks McCoy would struggle to be a hedgie were he in the market today. Compared with the late 1980s, they are also relatively discreet about their wealth. Their homes may be the size of football stadiums, but they are at least largely hidden from view behind those high walls. </p> <p> \"You don't have work in a huge glass silo like those off Wall Street to operate billion-dollar hedge funds, and there's nothing higher than five or six storeys in Greenwich,\" Wolfe says. \"They have small staffs - 25 people in a huddle will do - and they dress down. One of them is known for going to meetings with investors bare-footed.\"</p> <p>The question now on everybody's minds, in Greenwich and beyond, is whether these Masters of the Universe will be smart enough to ride out the crisis, or whether they will be sucked down by the collapse of their old employers, the investment banks. The answer is hard to come by. But they are certainly suffering, with 2008 their worst year in recent memory. They are recording losses - not spine-chilling ones like the banks but losses none the less - and they are being forced to make adjustments to keep their clients from bolting.</p> <p>Roger Ibbotson, the chairman of the Connecticut-based hedge fund Zebra Capital and a professor at Yale School of Management, says returns are negative this year but most hedge funds' losses are in single digits so far. \"In some senses they are having a good year relative to the markets,\" he says.</p> <p>But these are troubled times, and change - to use an Obamaism - is in the air. Already the hedge funds have had emergency restrictions placed on them preventing them from short selling, or betting against declines, in the financial markets. Much heavier limitations are likely to follow from any new occupant of the White House. Steve Fraser, author of Wall Street: America's Dream Palace, believes the days of largesse, which he considers America's second Gilded Age, are coming to an end. \"There's such anger all across the country - an overwhelming sense that these people need to be reined back in. Regulation, which for decades has been a cuss word in American life, is now in good odour.\"</p> <p>So the future looks relatively tough for the new Masters of the Universe - though there is a limit to the amount of sympathy that is likely to arouse. Consider Richard Fuld, who had the distinction, and the fabulous riches that went with it, of being the longest-running CEO on Wall Street. He received a $22m bonus last year. Then Lehman Brothers went belly up. Since that day last month he has rarely been seen. Where is he? Slumming it in his Greenwich mansion. </p> <p>Wolfe isn't shedding any tears. Most of the top players, he points out, are far too smart not to have already laid down their \"nut\" - weather-free investments that provide enough interest on the capital to ensure their Round Hill Road lifestyles can be sustained no matter what. But for the meantime, while the storm lasts, the Masters of the Universe are keeping firmly out of sight. \"There are a lot of resentful people out there, what Nietzsche described as the tarantulas who get their satisfaction out of the fall of the mighty,\" Wolfe says. \"That's all the more reason for the hedge fund guys to stay out of the fight.\"</p>",
  "<p>While the talking heads were nattering on about Sarah Palin's debate, I can promise you that the real political professionals were obsessing about something else entirely on Thursday evening.</p> <p>The news that John McCain was pulling out of Michigan - closing offices and dispersing his staff to other states - was in reality the biggest US political news of the week now ending. Let's look closely at why.</p> <p>An American presidential election is won on a state-by-state basis. Each state has a certain number of electoral votes, based on the number of seats the state has in the lower federal house, the House of Representatives, plus two (because each state has two senators). Representation in the lower house is decided by population.</p> <p>For example, Ohio, with a population of 11.5 million, has 20 electoral votes - 18 congressional districts plus two seats in the Senate. Wyoming, population 520,000, has three - one congressional district plus two Senate seats. Add them all up and the total comes to 538 electoral votes. A majority of 538 - half plus one - is 270, and that's what a candidate needs to win.</p> <p>A good way to think of a presidential contest is to picture the two candidates as a political version of Karpov and Kasparov, and the United States as their giant chessboard, around which they must strategically move their pieces to win the combination of states that will get them to 270. </p> <p>Remember that competing in the various states costs money. The campaigns have to calculate everything from the cost of driving voters to the polls on election day to the price of 30 seconds of television advertising time in Orlando, Florida versus Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p> <p>So there's your background. Now, what's the current situation, and what are the ramifications of McCain running up the white flag in Michigan?</p> <p>Michigan is a \"blue\" state, having voted for Al Gore and John Kerry. But it didn't do so by wide margins, and it's one that McCain's people had very much been hoping to pick off and turn red. It has 17 electoral votes. Only seven states have more. McCain winning Michigan would have been a very big deal. But that's seemingly off the table now, barring some shocking development.</p> <p>Meanwhile, let's look at the other battleground states. The list is roughly as follows: Florida (27 electoral votes), Ohio (20), North Carolina (15), Virginia (13), Indiana (11), Colorado (nine), Iowa (seven), New Mexico (five) and New Hampshire (four). That's nine states worth a total of 111 electoral votes.</p> <p>Here's the interesting thing about those nine states: eight of them voted for George Bush in 2004. Only the smallest one - New Hampshire - went for Kerry. This means that the battle is taking place on what used to be almost entirely red territory but is now up for grabs.</p> <p>By contrast, aside from New Hampshire, there isn't a single Kerry state where McCain currently has more-or-less even footing in the polls. A few are close-ish - a margin for Barack Obama of five points or fewer - notably Pennsylvania (21) and Minnesota (10). But in none would you say today that McCain is poised to capture it.</p> <p>In other words, Obama's pawns and knights are advancing across the board. That he will no longer have to fight over Michigan means he can redeploy the troops to, say, Indiana. If he can pick off that state, which hasn't voted Democratic since 1964: checkmate.</p> <p>Here's the matter as straightforwardly as I can put it. Kerry won 251 electoral votes. Assume that Obama can hold those - by no means a given, but something he seems positioned today to do. Add Iowa, which Kerry lost but where Obama is comfortably ahead. That's 258. </p> <p>Taking Iowa off the board means that eight battleground states remain, totalling 104 electoral votes. Obama needs to win only 12 of those 104 - one or at most two states. And today, he is currently leading or tied in six of them.</p> <p>McCain will push extra-hard into Pennsylvania. Two more debates will arrive. And who knows what new national or international crisis looms that might completely change the dynamic of the race. But with a month to go, the chessboard is assuming shape. White's king is exposed.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden<a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/politics/wb/179106\"> is coming to town</a>. Locally that is pretty big news. No one that I've spoken to really expected a Democrat to bother with these parts given the size of the town and the immensity of the Republican support dominates the media market around it. Nationally it marks a paradigm shift. It suggests a confidence among Democrats that is pushing them deep into enemy territory.</p> <p>It also signals how central Virginia could be to the outcome of the election. <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2008/10/obama-hold-rally-newport-news-Saturday\">Obama is coming to Virginia's eastern shores </a>again tomorrow.</p> <p>Given McCain's now almost certain defeat in Iowa and New Mexico and the tight nature of the race in Colorado, it is difficult to see how he could possibly win the presidency if he doesn't win Virginia, particularly now he has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.johnmccain\">pulled his staff out of Michigan</a>. </p> <p>Unless the couple of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2008/oct/03/uselections.polltracker.obama.mccain\">tight polls</a> in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/minnesota\">Minnesota</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colorado\">Colorado</a> yesterday illustrate a comeback - which is possible but unlikely - then McCain is playing defence everywhere apart from New Hampshire with Obama challenging throughout including North Carolina, Indiana, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nevada\">Nevada</a> and finally <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>.</p> <p>Obama needs 18 more electoral votes than John Kerry had; Virginia has 13. Despite a poll yesterday putting McCain ahead here - the first such result in almost two weeks - the truth is the Republicans have been late to recognize just <a href=\"http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2008-10-02-0123.html\">how vital the state will be</a>. </p> <p>Having thought they wouldn't have to compete here they are opening 12 more offices statewide, making a total of 20. Obama on the other hand could win without Virginia. Yet his campaign already has 45 offices here. </p> <p>In gubernatorial and Senate elections the Democratic strategy has been to rack up huge victories in the northern Virginia, hold your own in Hampton Roads, where Obama will be tomorrow and limit the margins of defeat here in the southwest.</p> <p>Hence Obama and Biden's one-two visit. The Republicans are sure to follow. Virginia is the new Ohio. It looks like Obama realised that before McCain did.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Contact Gary Younge at <a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Change appears to be political buzzword of the times. Labour MP Jon Cruddas ran on the slogan \"Choose Change\"; Barack Obama went with \"The Change we Need\", while this week even David Cameron finished his <a href=\" http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/david-cameron-conference-speech-in-full/\">conference speech</a> on the theme of change.</p> <p>But there is another \"change\" taking place, at present below the mainstream political radar, but it is a change that could sweep through the political establishment if not quickly addressed. This change is reactionary \u2013 it is the rise of the British National party.</p> <p>The BNP is a growing force in Britain. In <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7382831.stm\">May's local elections</a> it averaged 13.9% in the 612 wards it contested across the country, while in London it polled 130,714 votes in the London assembly elections. Locally, its results have been even more startling. It averaged 41% in the wards it contested in Barking and Dagenham in 2006, and this year it averaged 28% in Rotherham and 27% in <a href=\"http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/news/BNP-rally-Stoke-Trent-attract-400-party-members/article-308846-detail/article.html\">Stoke-on-Trent</a>.</p> <p>Next year the BNP could win the Stoke-on-Trent mayoral election and has a strong chance of gaining several MEPs in the European elections, particularly in the North West, West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humber constituencies. Victory here, with the respectability and finances the job carries, will transform the BNP into a major political force.</p> <p>Why is this happening? The BNP is growing for several reasons, including the poor quality of some existing councillors and political parties taking voters for granted. Then there is concern among some over rising immigration and the changing face of Britain. The BNP itself has had a facelift. It has publicly diluted its policies to appear more moderate and mainstream and it has adopted increasingly sophisticated campaign techniques and in its internet operation it has the <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23438904-details/BNP's+site+'the+most+popular+in+politics'/article.do\">most visited</a> party political website in Britain.</p> <p>However, the BNP's growing appeal is more than simply a product of rising racism, though of course this remains at the heart of its politics. The BNP is tapping into political alienation and economic deprivation. It is providing a voice for those who increasingly feel ignored and cast aside by Labour as it chases the mythical \"middle England\". It is a consequence of a political system that concentrates resources and activism to a few key swing marginals.</p> <p>The BNP is articulating the concerns, grievances and even prejudices of these forgotten voters. It provides them with a sense of belonging, an articulation of their own frustration \u2013 even a new white identity.</p> <p>The emergence of the BNP is just one consequence of the change under way, and it is a change far more fundamental than many political commentators and politicians appear to register. It is also primarily an issue affecting the Labour party.</p> <p>This is a phenomenon occurring across Europe and North America. In the United States, middle-American nationalism has emerged over the past 30 years, which despises the corporate elites above and the \"undeserving\" poor below. Across western Europe we have seen working-class voters turn towards far-right and populist parties at the expense of centre-left parties. Only a few days ago, two far right parties polled a combined 29% in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/30/austria\">Austrian elections</a>.</p> <p>Antifascism has to change to meet this new threat. Unless we understand why the BNP is growing \u2013 and that entails accepting that its appeal is built on more than simple racism \u2013 we have little chance of defeating it.</p> <p>A simple \"Don't vote Nazi\" slogan is no longer enough. Of course we need to expose the true politics of the BNP leaders but we also need to address the issues on which the BNP campaign.</p> <p>There is a limit to what traditional antifascism can deliver. We can certainly organise a turnout campaign to defeat the BNP in an election and through focused and localised leaflets we can undermine and expose the racism and ineffectiveness of BNP councillors and candidates. We must also get involved in the very communities where the BNP is most active, something progressives have increasingly failed to do over recent years.</p> <p>However, if we accept the BNP is filling a void in British politics then it is a political response to these underlying issues of disengagement and disillusionment that ultimately needs addressing.</p> <p>The political climate is certainly changing, but unless we act now then the change might not be to our liking.</p> <p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/12/2?commentid=ebd4c539-3c92-442a-866a-1cfaad038af2\">AdamFostas</a> for suggesting this commission on the You Tell Us thread</em></p>",
  "<p>The quality of English-language teaching for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers is improving, according to a new report by the education watchdog Ofsted. </p> <p>But it warns that a lot more needs to be done to ensure standards are lifted beyond \"satisfactory\" levels, and makes a series of recommendations to protect and enhance services. <br> In a report published today, Ofsted says inadequate English-language teaching in adult and community colleges is now rare. The number of colleges providing less-than-satisfactory Esol (English for Speakers of Other Languages) has fallen to one in 16, down from one in five in the period 2001-2005.  But the report says that despite marked improvements in training quality and success rates, only around half the Esol provided by colleges - and just a fifth by adult and community learning providers - is good or outstanding. </p> <p>Inspectors visited 14 further education colleges, eight adult and community learning providers, five independent work-based learning providers, and one learndirect provider between September 2007 and February 2008. </p> <p>It also received responses to a survey from 114 colleges and 30 ACL providers responsible for 62% of Esol enrolments funded in colleges by the Learning and Skills Council in 2006-07. <br> Ofsted's chief inspector, Christine Gilbert, said that equipping learners with good language skills gave them the confidence to make a positive contribution to the community: \"Good English speaking skills are critical to millions of people, and open up a world of opportunities and benefits to learners, such as developing skills for the workplace and integrating further with the community.  \"While it's encouraging to see a general picture of improvement, it is time that standards were raised, so that the overwhelming majority of Esol provision is good or better.\"  The report finds that the most effective lessons are those where learners can practise and develop their speaking skills at length, with skilled, often non-verbal, intervention from their teacher. </p> <p>Encouragingly, a large majority of learners are now working towards externally recognised qualifications, as part of the government's Skills for Life strategy, which places particular emphasis on speaking and listening skills. <br> On the whole, students spoke positively about the opportunity to learn English, and found their new skills extremely helpful in coping with daily life, from simple activities \u2013 such as shopping, or talking to doctors - to more complex vocational skills such as writing resumes, going to interviews and having phone conversations about jobs.  Provision of Esol in the workplace is growing, but providers still find it difficult to persuade employers of its benefits.  The report also finds that although an increasing number of providers offer Esoll integrated with vocational training, the range of vocational subjects offered tended to be narrow. On skills programmes specifically aimed at improving employment prospects, too few learners had the opportunity to do work experience.  Following the introduction of fees for certain categories of learners in 2007, some colleges saw a drop in enrolments and demand, while others reported no change or an increase in demand for Esol training. With no clear patterns emerging, the report suggests the impact of fees on enrolments should continue to be closely monitored. </p> <p> <br>The report recommends: \u2022 The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills should closely monitor the impact of major changes in Esol fee policy. <br>\u2022 The Learning and Skills Council should persuade employers of the value of offering Esol to their employees. It should ensure providers receive timely information on funding arrangements and fees. <br>\u2022 Providers should take action to increase success rates in Skills for Life qualifications and improve on the attention given to individual needs in learning sessions. They should ensure learners on employability programmes receive adequate work experience. </p> <p>A Dius spokesperson said: \"Since 2001, Esol has helped over 2 million people improve their English language skills, and funding increased to over \u00a31bn between 2001 and 2004/05. </p> <p>\"The new right to request time to train will afford employees the right to ask for Esol classes. </p> <p>\"We are developing proposals on prioritising Esol funding towards promoting community cohesion following our consultation earlier this year.\"</p>",
  "<p>Liam Byrne today got the promotion to the cabinet he hoped for and expected when Gordon Brown became prime minister. Now Byrne is minister for the Cabinet Office, a role it is difficult to make a success of but for which his old career as a management consultant should help him.</p> <p>Long regarded as one of the government's \"rising stars,\" the Labour MP for Hodge Hill was, until today, minister for the West Midlands, as well as borders and immigration minister at the Treasury and the Home Office. His careful handling of controversial issues such as the new rules on citizenship, the drafting of legislation for compulsory ID cards and the creation of the new UK Borders Agency has won him many plaudits. John Reid, the former home secretary, admires him enormously and lobbied for his promotion last year. But with several other ministerial changes in the slimmed-down Home Office, Byrne was required to mind the shop.</p> <p>First promoted to the frontbench as a junior health minister by Tony Blair, Byrne was just 34 when he was elected to parliament in 2004 and landed his first government job nine months later.</p> <p>Byrne was briefly minister of state for police and counter-terrorism before being handed the immigration brief by John Reid, the then-home secretary.<br> Before entering public life, Byrne cofounded his own IT firm, the venture capital backed e-commerce company, eGS Group.</p> <p>He previously worked for multinational consulting firm, Accenture and merchant bankers, NM Rothschild. Between 1996 and 1997 he advised the Labour party on the reorganisation of Millbank and helped lead its national business campaign to woo business leaders.</p> <p>Byrne has written widely about public service reform, economic development, and shared values. </p> <p>Born in Warrington in October 1970, Byrne joined the Labour party when he was 15.</p> <p>He studied politics and modern history at Manchester University and is a fellow of the Social Market Foundation. </p> <p>Byrne now lives in Birmingham with his wife Sarah and three children.</p>",
  "<p>The recent electoral success of the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1c810cc0-8e87-11dd-9b46-0000779fd18c.html\">far-right parties</a> in Austria and the detention of the alleged Holocaust denier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/secondworldwar.australia\">Gerald T\u00f6ben</a> in Britain together raise some awkward questions. How should liberal, democratic societies deal with those who espouse antisemitism and racism, who deny the systematic mass murder of the Jews by the Nazis, and who pour vitriol on Muslims and gay people?</p> <p>Despite decades of \"Holocaust education\" and the building of Holocaust memorials, 29% of Austrian voters cast their ballot for the heirs and admirers of National Socialism. Although the Austrian government is a member of an intergovernmental taskforce dedicated to promoting memory of the Holocaust and its grim lessons worldwide, at home it cannot even convince its own population to stay away from the suit-wearing inheritors of Hitler's toxic ideology.</p> <p>And notwithstanding the metastasisation of antisemitism on the web and state promotion of Holocaust denial, most openly and notoriously by Iran, there are many people in this country who denounce the process that will enable Germany to extradite and prosecute T\u00f6ben. They argue that Britain has a reputation for freedom of speech and has long given asylum to those persecuted for their views. Britain, therefore, should be a haven for such as him even though his utterances are despicable.</p> <p>Something is going wrong here. First, \"Holocaust education\" is bouncing off the far right. Although its advocates claimed that it would help to blunt racism in general and encourage acceptance of difference, it seems that to the target audience not all difference is the same. It has become common for extreme rightwingers to malign Islam or Gypsies, while at the same time averring philo-semitism. The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1915484/Rome's-new-mayor-promises-purge-of-migrants.html\">new mayor of Rome</a> is a case in point.</p> <p>Second, liberal society's abhorrence of neo-Nazi ideology commingles with a frisson of pleasure, not to say envy, at their naughtiness, taboo-breaking, and defiance of conventional wisdom. At one extreme the defenders of what was once unacceptable come from the swollen ranks of those attracted to \"counterknowledge\", the internet bred and fed millions who believe anything generated by the \"establishment\" must be a half truth or a lie.</p> <p>What links these two phenomena is the insidious claim that there is a \"Holocaust industry\" and that everything from historical research to raising \"Holocaust awareness\" is a ramp to benefit Jewish interests and Israel.</p> <p>Then there are those who deplore Islamophobia, antisemitism, racism and homophobia who simultaneously defend the right of creative figures, and logically anyone else, to cause offence. It would be nice to call this a \"principled\" stand but it is precisely the lack of any aesthetic principle by which creativity can be judged that has reduced the benchmark of appreciation to breaking taboos and upsetting people.</p> <p>These attitudes create a penumbra in which T\u00f6ben and his ilk can operate with impunity. Or not. Because the German authorities see things differently and now have the legal mechanisms to act even if a person alleged to have broken their laws is on UK territory. Yet his case has triggered alarm calls here from those who argue that democracy and tolerance are robust enough not to need laws for their defence. But how would it look if the far right in the UK started taking 5 or 10 or 20% of the vote in local and national elections? If they took power at some level?</p> <p>In countries with a memory of how fragile democracy can be, the fractional loss of liberty entailed in penalising the expression of neo-Nazi views or Holocaust denial seems a small price to pay compared to what can follow if the far right is shielded all the way into power. By contrast we in Britain tend to take the robustness of our democracy for granted. We forget that for much of the last century, democracy was a rare and vulnerable species of political culture, easily rendered extinct. The plight of democracy in most post-communist countries ought to be a reminder that not so much has changed in that respect.</p> <p>With a global recession on the horizon, possibly bringing with it mass unemployment, homelessness, poverty, and cuts in government budgets for welfare, who would like to bank on democracy staying in robust good health? In a few years time, the extradition of T\u00f6ben might look like a smart move if it sends a message to the far right in Austria, not to mention our own breed, that those who incite hatred and seek to undermine liberty will not be given sanctuary.</p>",
